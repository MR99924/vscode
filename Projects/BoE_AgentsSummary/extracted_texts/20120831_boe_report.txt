August 2012Demand
Consumption
The rate of growth of spending on consumer goods and
services had slowed further, with nominal demand now onlymoderately higher than a year earlier, entirely due to higherprices.  Spending patterns continued to be more volatile thanusual, in an environment of broadly flat demand overall.Recent weakness was thought to be, in large part, a reflectionof poor weather, which had particularly depressed demand forclothing and footwear, outdoor furniture and leisureequipment, and discouraged shopping more generally.Households continued to economise wherever possible.  Andthe market remained characterised by shifts in market share,with internet sellers and destination shopping centrescontinuing to win custom from the high street, and cheaperproducts benefiting as a result of ongoing trading down frommid-range ones.
Housing market
The housing market had weakened somewhat in recentmonths, but contacts were uncertain whether that reflectedtemporary factors.  The wet weather, Euro 2012, theDiamond Jubilee and the end of stamp duty relief, were alllikely to have weighed on search activity.  But some contactsthought that there may have also been a loss of confidencedue to worries about the economy.  In addition, transactionswere reported to be taking even longer and there were moreinstances of mortgage offers being withdrawn as a result oflower-than-expected property valuations by lenders.  Demandat the top end of the market had slowed noticeably anddownsizing had become a more prominent driver of movesthan in the past.  Buy-to-let demand continued to supportactivity at the lower end of the market.
Business investment
Contacts’ plans for capital spending had softened ( Chart 1 )
due to the increasingly uncertain demand environment bothat home and abroad.  Firms continued to undertake routinereplacement investment and repair and maintenance work.Other projects typically had to pay for themselves within ashorter period than prior to the recession, leading to anemphasis on investment which generated a rapid return, suchas energy and labour-saving technologies, or productdevelopment to reduce costs.  Compliance with newregulations was also a key driver of investment in a numberof sectors.  
Exports
Export growth had slowed significantly in recent months,largely due to weakness across the euro area, and somesoftening in the United States.  Export growth to emergingmarket economies had moderated somewhat, mainly due toweaker demand from China.  Nevertheless, contacts oftenremained optimistic about future opportunities for growth
through gains in market share and entry into new markets.The Middle East and South America were still buoyant andAfrica was increasingly mentioned as a source of robustgrowth.  So far, there had been few reports of a negativeimpact on demand arising from the recent appreciation of thepound against the euro, but some firms had seen marginsnarrow as sterling prices had been allowed to fall.
Output
Business services
The pace of growth of turnover in the service sector hadslowed further ( Chart 2 ).  Activity continued to be supported
by corporate investment, with IT firms often busy helpingother companies with their efforts to raise productivity anddevelop an online profile.  And legal and accountancy practiceswere frequently involved in assisting with regulatorycompliance work across a range of sectors.  In contrast,logistics firms reported that output had weakened on the backof slower domestic demand and trade, while corporatedemand for non-essential services such as hotelaccommodation, hospitality and conferencing facilities hadfallen further.  Advisory work on mergers and acquisitions, andcommercial property transactions, had also weakened asuncertainty had induced businesses to postpone expansionplans.
Manufacturing
Manufacturing output growth had eased and the level ofactivity was only slightly higher than a year earlier ( Chart 2 ).
The primary source of final demand had been from abroad,helping to support firms throughout the domestic supplychain.  But a weakening in foreign markets was weighingheavily on growth.  Firms supplying the domestic markettypically continued to report that activity was broadly flat on ayear earlier, reflecting sluggish consumer demand anddeclining public sector spending, particularly on defence.Furniture makers corroborated stories of weakness in the2

housing market, having seen demand fall away recently.
Where there were reports of growth, that was often the resultof gains in market share — in food production, for instance,where there was still surplus capacity.
Construction
Construction output continued to contract ( Chart 2 ), due in
large part to the dwindling pipeline of public sector work.Activity on utilities and renewable energy projects had alsoslowed.  Recently, temporary factors had added to downwardimpetus in the sector.  The very wet weather in many parts ofthe country had disrupted work on some sites and travelrestrictions related to the Olympics had caused activity to besuspended on some large developments in London.  There wassome support to activity from the construction of studentaccommodation, care homes, house building, andinfrastructure development in energy and transport.  Work onrefurbishment of retail premises had also picked up a little, assome of the larger supermarket chains scaled back theirexpansion plans to focus more closely on existing propertyportfolios.  Across the industry, contacts continued to reportthat the sector was being held back by a number of factors,with uncertainty about government policy, planning issues andfunding constraints foremost among them.
Credit conditions
Credit conditions remained polarised.  Businesses with strongbalance sheets, cash flow and assets typically had access tofunding at reasonable rates.  But firms failing to meet thosecriteria often found it difficult to obtain loans at terms thatwere acceptable.  Banks remained very wary of lending to theproperty sector, or to businesses exposed to the weakness ofhousehold spending.  And small companies sometimesstruggled to secure credit at all.  The tendency for banksincreasingly to seek collateral against which to secure loanswas also often discouraging owners of small businesses fromborrowing, as they were reluctant to use personal assets assecurity.  In response to tight credit conditions, some firms
were building up cash reserves to finance investmentinternally, or to generate a precautionary buffer in the event ofa sudden decline in demand.  Some businesses were refrainingfrom applying for loans due to a perception that they would beunavailable, but many contacts reported that they had noneed to borrow because there was a lack of opportunity forinvestment.  Bad debts generally remained under control,although there had been a pickup in reports of difficultiessecuring payment from customers in some countries in theeuro area.
Employment
Employment intentions remained fairly flat ( Chart 3 ).  In an
uncertain environment, businesses were hesitant aboutcommitting to any changes in payroll until the outlookbecame clearer.  There continued to be significant variationswithin sectors, reflecting the shifting mix of demand in thewider economy.  Suppliers to the public sector and tohouseholds were often trimming headcount, while thosebenefiting from foreign demand growth and corporateinvestment were more likely to be hiring.  And whilesupermarkets and discount retailers were taking on staff, jobswere being lost as a result of store closures on the high street.Across sectors, a number of factors, including changes to theregulatory landscape, and issues surrounding pensions andemployment law, continued to support job creation for variousdifferent types of specialist professional staff — in riskmanagement and compliance, for instance.
Capacity utilisation
Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector remained alittle below normal ( Chart 4 ), reflecting recent softening in the
pace of growth of demand, as well as past investment andemployment growth.  But while those supplying the domesticmarket often had a significant degree of slack, exporters werefrequently at near to full capacity, with some facing5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4

weakening demand abroad had eased staffing pressuresrecently.  In services, many firms were operating with a ratherlarger amount of spare capacity than in manufacturing(Chart 4 ).  But employees were often busy working on tenders
or had been moved into regulatory and compliance-relatedactivities.  In retail, staff were often underemployed andcontacts were responding by adopting more flexible workingpatterns to tailor total hours to customer numbers, or wereclosing stores altogether.
Costs and prices
Labour costs
The rate of growth of labour costs per head remainedrestrained and had slowed somewhat in recent months.Settlements had fallen back across industries, reflecting acombination of weakening demand, rising uncertainty aboutthe outlook and easing inflationary pressure.  And there hadbeen an increase in the number of reports of pay freezes,particularly in construction and retail.  Firms were increasinglymoving away from across the board settlements towardsindividual performance-related pay, or to focus on theretention of key personnel, while some employers had skewedpay awards towards those at the lower end of the scale.  Therewas also more widespread use of bonuses in an attempt toavoid locking in permanent increases in the wage bill.Contacts frequently reported that significant managementeffort was being devoted to pensions, either to cope with thechallenge posed by deficits on legacy funds, or to prepare forpension auto-enrolment.Non-labour costs
Inflation in the cost of raw materials continued to moderate, inlarge part due to slowing demand growth in the rest of theworld, which had caused various commodity prices to fall backfrom recent highs.  But the expectation of poor harvestsabroad had begun to push up the prices of some basicfoodstuffs, such as wheat, soya and maize.  The appreciation ofsterling against the euro had lowered the price paid for someimports.  And a number of contacts had seen a decline in thecost of energy, although for many businesses on fixed-termcontracts it would take some time for this to take effect.  Theprice of imports of finished goods had begun to level off,reflecting slowing cost inflation for foreign producers, as wellas the rise in sterling.  Softer world demand for imported finalgoods had also put some downward pressure on prices.
Output prices
The pace of inflation in manufacturing output prices continuedto decline, reflecting softening cost pressures.  Some firmsreported that they had now fully passed on past increases ininput costs, while others felt that further price increases wouldbe very difficult given the weakness of demand both at homeand in foreign markets.  But even among businesses where costincreases had not been passed on in full, margins were oftennot far from normal, considerable lengths having been takenover the past few years to find efficiencies and squeezeproduction costs wherever possible.  Turning to the servicesector, fees for business services were broadly unchanged froma year earlier, in large part due to persistent spare capacity inmuch of the industry.  But specialised service providers, in ITfor example, were often able to secure significant priceincreases.  
Consumer prices
Consumer price inflation continued to fall back towards the2.0% target.  That was, in part, the result of reductions in fuelprices, and wet weather had led to earlier discounting thanusual for a range of seasonal products.  Some retailersexpected food inflation to begin to pick up going forward,however, due to poor global harvests for some crops.  Veryweak demand continued to weigh on the prices ofdiscretionary services, particularly in leisure and tourism,prompting widespread discounting and increased use ofpromotions.  But inflation had been supported by priceincreases earlier in the year for various regulated services, suchas transport and social housing, which were often linked toofficial measures of inflation.4

–Ability to meet expected demand over the next six monthsChart 4 Capacity utilisationAgents’ survey on consumer demand
The agents asked businesses about the prospects for
household spending over the rest of 2012, and the likely driversof expected changes.  248 companies participated in thesurvey, with combined turnover of around £171 billion.  Thefollowing results are weighted by turnover.
Firms reported that there had been a very modest rise in
turnover between 2012 H1 and the same period a year earlier,with a small positive net percentage balance of businessesreporting that turnover had increased ( Chart A ).  There was
some variation across industries, however, with contacts in theservice sector typically having seen a significantly strongerperformance over the period than other businesses ( Chart B ).
Given these sectoral differences, it is important to note thatthe survey sample was considerably underweight in servicesproviders on a turnover-weighted basis.  If greater weightwas placed on services, the survey results would point to arather stronger improvement in turnover during the first halfof the year.Looking ahead, respondents expected slightly stronger growth
during 2012 H2, compared with 2011 H2 ( Chart A ).  This
improvement is reflected across most sectors ( Chart B ), with
retailers in particular appearing to be more optimistic aboutthe second half compared with the first half.  Nevertheless,the relatively stronger balance for goods producers suggestedthat there might be some stockbuilding over the comingsix months.  Wholesalers remained gloomy, as smallbusinesses were expected to struggle over the rest of the year.
Broadly, firms reported that the expected change in turnover in
2012 H2 was likely to be driven by rising prices, rather thanvolumes ( Chart C ).  But given the relatively small weight of
the service sector in the sample, it may be reasonable toexpect more of a spur to turnover from growth in volumes, andless from higher prices, than suggested by the weighted totals.In terms of behavioural drivers of demand, businesses wereoften optimistic about their own ability to tailor strategies tostimulate spending, either through changes to their productsor pricing ( Chart D ).  But they were generally pessimistic
about the prospect of improvements in household spendingpower, confidence, and access to credit.
