September 2012Demand
Consumption
Spending on consumer goods and services continued to grow
at a gradual pace ( Chart 1 ).  Promotions remained essential to
support demand as households were still very much focusedon finding value for money, with discount retailers gainingmarket share from mid-range ones.  There was also an ongoingshift away from the high street towards shopping online anddestination retail centres.  Consumers were trying to cut costsin various ways, such as reducing levels of insurance cover andhaving cars serviced less frequently, and there had been a risein demand for financial advice, both to maximise returns onassets, and to minimise tax liabilities.  According to somecontacts, unseasonably dreary weather for much of thesummer had led to higher numbers of people holidayingabroad compared with a year earlier, and it had weighedheavily on some leisure and tourist attractions at home.  TheOlympics had created some winners and losers, but the overallimpact on demand had been fairly muted.
Housing market
The housing market remained subdued.  That was partly due tothe usual summer lull, with some contacts suggesting thatactivity may have been postponed due to the Olympics.  Butthere was a concern that there would be no pickup in theautumn, due to worries about the economy.  Many banks werepreparing to make use of the Funding for Lending Scheme, butit was too soon for it to have had any impact on demand.  Andcredit conditions continued to frustrate the aspirations ofsome would-be homeowners.  Numbers of first-time buyershad risen slightly, but buy-to-let continued to account for alarger share of transactions than prior to the recession.  Furtherup the housing chain, activity was in large part driven by theusual factors of debt, death and divorce.  Growing numbers ofvendors were reported to be lowering their asking prices tostimulate interest.  Business investment
Investment intentions suggested that the level of capitalspending would be broadly unchanged over the coming twelve months.  There continued to be some plans forexpansion in the manufacturing sector, notably amongexporters, as well as some food producers.  But manymanufacturing firms had become more cautious about theoutlook, revising down their expectations for activity in theeuro area, and had scaled back their investment projectsaccordingly.  In services, spending was often motivated byessential maintenance or the need to reduce costs.  Regulatorychange was also prompting investment in systems to ensurecompliance with new rules.  And spending on IT was neededsimply to stay abreast of the competition, with an onlinepresence increasingly important to maintain market share.
Exports
Export growth continued to slow, reflecting weakeningconditions throughout the euro area ( Chart 2 ).  Some contacts
had experienced problems securing payments from countriesin the south of the euro area and had turned down subsequentorders as a result.  And some suppliers to the public sectorreported significant declines in demand.  Rising awareness of the extent of economic problems in the euro area hadcaused many contacts to lower their expectations for growththere, adding momentum to the shift in focus towardsemerging markets as a possible substitute for lost demand.But there were also signs of a moderation in the pace ofexpansion in these rapid growth markets, most notably inChina.  Generally, the recent rise in the value of sterling wasnot thought to have affected volumes of exports, as contactshad held their foreign prices constant.  But inbound tourismhad slowed compared with a year earlier, adding to thepossible drag from net trade resulting from an increase in tripsabroad by UK holidaymakers.2

Output
Business services
Turnover in the business service sector continued to rise at a
gradual pace, with the volume of activity edging highercompared with a year earlier, while fierce competition keptprices from rising.  Reports remained very mixed across subsectors, reflecting the pattern of spending in the widereconomy.  For instance, IT advisory companies were benefitingfrom corporates’ efforts to find efficiencies, while businessesfacing the consumer and those exposed to the government,often reported that conditions were difficult.  And even withinsectors, experiences varied considerably, as a result of shifts inmarket share.  For instance, public relations companiesreported increased demand from firms seeking to enter newmarkets, and corporate travel had risen as businesses soughtto extend their reach.  In contrast, in corporate hospitality,training and security, activity had fallen back as firmsredoubled their efforts to cut anything but the most essentialspending.
Manufacturing
The growth rate of manufacturing for the domestic market hadslowed further and was broadly flat compared with a yearearlier ( Chart 2 ).  That reflected a combination of softening
demand from households and corporates, lower public sectorspending, and the impact of weaker trade on export supplychains.  As a result, many firms had revised their expectationsfor the outlook downwards.  The aerospace industry remainedamong the most buoyant, in part because of the very long leadtimes involved in production in that sector.  In contrast,activity in the automotive sector had slowed somewhat,although demand for premium brands remained robust.  Therecontinued to be a modest flow of reports from businesses thathad decided to repatriate production processes, as customerdemand for shorter production runs, at shorter notice than pre-recession, had eroded much of the cost advantages offoreign production.  And there continued to be concerns aboutthe quality of foreign supply.
Construction
The level of construction output had fallen compared with ayear earlier, due in large part to reductions in work for thepublic sector, along with some weather-related disruption tosites.  There was, however, some support to the level of activityfrom the energy sector, utilities, warehousing and distribution,and private house building.  There was relatively littlecommercial property development in train, due to an overhangof office and retail space in much of the country, and largerretailers had trimmed plans for expansion through new storeopenings.Credit conditions
The cost of borrowing for companies was creeping upward asbanks passed on higher funding costs.  Large businesses tendedto have access to credit on acceptable terms.  But smallerbusinesses, in particular, were often discouraged fromborrowing by the need to provide guarantees, an increasinglyprevalent condition for lending.  As a result, small firms wereoften considering the use of non-bank sources of borrowing, orequity finance.  While credit conditions were tighter than priorto the recession, lenders suggested that it was currently a lackof demand that was holding back borrowing.  And firmsthemselves often reported that they were not prepared toincrease their indebtedness for the purposes of investing,prefering to finance capital projects from internal sources.Awareness of the Funding for Lending Scheme among firmswas rising.  There was some concern, however, that fees andcollateral requirements might not ease with any reduction inlending rates.
Employment
Employment intentions indicated that there would be little jobcreation in the private sector over the coming six months.  Inmanufacturing, growth industries, particularly in export,continued to raise headcount, while those supplying weakersectors, such as construction and retail, were typically seekingto reduce heads.  But even firms that expected little demandgrowth were often reluctant to lose key staff, given structuralshortages of certain skills.  In business services, some largeprofessional firms were taking on graduates as they gainedmarket share, while firm exits and mergers among smallercompetitors were expected to result in job losses.  But, again,here too, there was a general unwillingness to let staff go.  Inretail, large national chains and discount stores plannedfurther recruitment as they won custom from the high streetand mid-range stores, respectively.  These latter businesses,meanwhile, were often at minimum staffing levels, and couldonly lower the number of employees by closingunderperforming outlets altogether.
Capacity utilisation
Businesses in expanding sectors were often at full capacity.This was particularly evident among exporters, although therehad been some easing in constraints due to slowing foreigndemand.  In areas of persistent weakness, by contrast, therewas typically a rather more significant degree of slack.  Someof this had been eliminated through mergers and businessclosures — in legal and accountancy practices, for example.But consolidation to date had not been sufficient to have anoticeable impact on the extent of spare capacity overall.  As aresult, competitive pressures remained extremely fierce asfirms sought to win market share.  This was most evident inbusiness services of a standardised nature, such as audit, and in
manufacturing for the domestic construction sector.Companies in these industries were often busy competing forwork, but winning relatively little.
Costs and prices
Labour costs
Growth in labour costs per employee continued to moderate.Contacts reported that there was relatively little upwardpressure on settlements from staff, with awards typicallyaround 2% or 3%.  And pay freezes remained common,performance having disappointed relative to expectations formany businesses.  Where there had been more generousawards, they were often justified on the grounds of catch-upfor past restraint in pay, or were a reflection of risingprofitability.  Some of them were also attributed to the need to retain key personnel — typically those with skills that were in short supply, such as engineers and IT specialists.Across-the-board pay increases and inflation linking wereincreasingly giving way to individual performance-basedsettlements.
Non-labour costs
Non-labour input cost inflation continued to slow ( Chart 3 ),
with the prices of both raw materials and imports of finishedgoods having levelled off, or even fallen back a little, in thecase of some commodities.  Upward pressure from risinglabour costs in some emerging market producers, mostnotably China, had begun to abate.  And the recent rise insterling had also lowered the cost of some imported goods.But energy prices had begun to increase again recently, and theprices of various cereals and feedstock had also begun to rise inanticipation of poor harvests in both the United States andEurope.  That was expected to push up the price of basicfoodstuffs going forward.  And shipping costs had risen quitesharply as excess capacity had been mothballed.Output prices
Domestic manufacturing output price inflation had declinedfurther, as easing cost pressures fed through the supply chain(Chart 4 ).  A few firms continued to report that they were
raising prices to recover lost margin, but most felt thatsoftening demand conditions had limited the scope to raiseprices in the near term.  Suppliers of consumer goods facedparticularly strong resistance from customers to any priceincreases, as did manufacturers producing inputs for theconstruction and public sectors.  Business services prices werebroadly unchanged compared with a year earlier ( Chart 4 ).
And contacts often reported that there was downwardpressure on fees in those sectors with the greatest amounts ofspare capacity, such as corporate hospitality and haulage,exacerbated by the still very low level of insolvencies duringthis recession compared with previous ones.  
Consumer prices
The annual rate of consumer price inflation remained fairlymoderate, having fallen back in recent months.  That reflecteda combination of slowing inflation in the price of importedgoods, as well as softening domestic demand.  But fuel priceshad risen somewhat, and food prices were expected toincrease over the coming months, as the impact of poorharvests began to be felt.  Services inflation had slowed a littleover the past few months, particularly for discretionaryservices in the leisure industry.  But the annual rate of inflationcontinued to reflect fairly sizable increases in the prices ofregulated services, such as transport and social housing, whichwere linked to official measures of inflation.  The upwardpressure from this source of inflation was expected to ease inthe next round of price-setting.4
