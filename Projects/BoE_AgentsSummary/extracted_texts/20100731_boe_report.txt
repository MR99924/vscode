July 2010Demand
Consumption
The Agents’ contacts reported that retail sales values growth,
which had remained broadly steady during the early months of2010 ( Chart 1 ), had slowed a little through Q2.  Many contacts
thought that consumer sentiment had softened, and thatshoppers had begun to reduce expenditure in response toexpected changes in taxes and concerns about job security.Sales volumes growth is likely to have been weaker than valuesgrowth — while turnover had been higher than a year ago,retail prices had also risen over that period. 
New car sales had eased back in recent months, although 
they remained above their levels a year earlier.  In part, dealers attributed the relative resilience of car sales to thepromotional schemes they had introduced over the past threemonths, aimed at supporting demand following the expiry ofthe car scrappage scheme.
Turnover in the consumer services sector, which had been little
changed in recent months, also showed some signs of easing.Spending in restaurants and pubs had been subdued, anddemand for housing-related services had fallen back in linewith housing market activity (see below).  That said, visitorattractions reported increases in demand, and many contactshoped that the low level of sterling and concerns about traveldisruption (from airline strikes and the volcanic ash cloud)would encourage domestic residents to holiday within theUnited Kingdom.
Housing market
Activity in the housing market, which had been rising gentlyduring 2009 Q4 and early 2010, had softened a little in recentmonths.  Despite a slight increase in the availability of credit,demand continued to be constrained by the restrictions onmortgage finance, particularly for first-time buyers.  At thesame time, the decision to suspend Home Information Packs inEngland and Wales had encouraged sellers into the market,boosting the supply of properties.  As new sales instructions
had risen, the stock of available rental accommodation haddeclined.  That, coupled with strong demand from thoseunable to buy homes, had led to a further increase in rents.
Business investment
Investment intentions had continued to pick up ( Chart 2 ),
although they  remained consistent with a gradual rise inspending, rather than a more robust recovery.  New spendingplans remained in large part focused on improving efficiency(eg via saving energy and improving IT) or replacing assetswhose lives had been extended during the recession (eg vehiclefleets).  On balance, there remained few reports of investmentin new capacity.  The exceptions included some supermarketsand major retailers, which had continued to fund expansion ofnew stores, and some businesses that had increased spendingto expand export capacity.  Capital spending was usually beingfunded by internal resources, although many businessesremained reluctant to part with the holdings of cash that theyhad sought to accumulate during the recession.  
Exports and imports
Exports had risen further in June, mainly reflecting demandgrowth in the Far East, Africa and (to a lesser extent) theUnited States.  A growing number of contacts had begun toseek out new export opportunities, although this process wasexpected to take some time.  Signs of expenditure switchingaway from imports towards domestically sourced goods and services had increased a little further, but the lack ofappropriate supply capacity in the United Kingdom continuedto prevent many contacts from sourcing more componentsdomestically.
Output
Business services
Demand for professional and financial services (such as legal,accountancy, recruitment, advertising and IT services) hadbeen rising gradually over the past six months.  As a result, the2

Agents judged that turnover in Q2 was higher than its level a
year earlier.  Moreover, volumes growth is likely to have beenstronger than growth in turnover, given continued year-on-year declines in many professional and financialservices prices.  Growth in businesses services turnoverremained quite patchy.  Demand for distribution and logisticsservices had increased a little, reflecting the gentle rise inactivity and some selective restocking in pockets of theeconomy.  
The nascent recovery in demand for services had, however,
been gradual, and companies had continued to manageoverheads extremely tightly over the past six months.  Morerecently, the Agents had heard widespread reports that thepublic sector had begun (and was expected to continue) toeconomise on costs and cut back on discretionary spending. 
Manufacturing
Manufacturing output had been picking up for much of 2010,largely reflecting an increase in exports.  But output destinedfor the domestic market had also increased, in part reflectingsome re-sourcing of previously imported components back tothe domestic economy (eg in the automotive sector) andtentative signs of restocking in some parts of the economy. 
Construction
Following steep falls during much of the past two years,construction output had begun to stabilise in recent months.The recent stability had, however, masked divergent andoffsetting trends in different subsectors.  New residentialconstruction had been recovering slowly for some monthsnow, although the level of activity remained low, anddevelopers continued to report concerns about futureeconomic activity and difficulties in accessing bank finance.Offsetting the gentle recovery in residential construction,private commercial construction remained weak and thepipeline of projects had continued to dwindle, as existing workwas completed but not replaced with new activity.  And somepublic sector construction projects (eg road maintenance andsocial housing projects) had already been put on hold orcancelled.  The majority of contacts expected the furtherplanned reductions in public spending to prompt a renewedfall in construction output over the coming year or so.
Credit conditions
On balance, the Agents judged that the availability of bankcredit had improved a little since the start of 2010.  That said,conditions remained significantly tighter than those prevailingprior to the financial crisis, and individual businesses’experiences had remained extremely diverse.  For example,small and medium-sized businesses, along with propertydevelopers and those with significant exposures to theconstruction sector continued to face particular difficultyaccessing affordable finance.  Demand for bank loans remainedmuted, with many businesses continuing to reduce their
leverage by paying down bank debt.
Bad debts had so far remained well contained, and insolvencies
remained well below many contacts’ expectations.  Butlooking ahead, a number of contacts, particularly those in theproperty sector, expressed concerns about their ability torefinance loans.  Some worried that these issues would lead toa rise in corporate failures over the coming year.
Employment
The Agents reported a modest improvement in private sectoremployment intentions.  But the pickup in recruitment wasexpected to be limited:  some companies would still be able tomeet higher demand through increases in hours, including thereintroduction of overtime.  And where companies wereplanning to recruit, they often planned to hire temporary staff,rather than increase permanent headcount, due to uncertaintyabout the economic outlook.  Moreover, contacts felt that thenews about public sector employment prospects had been lessencouraging.  Some public bodies had already begun reducingstaff numbers, and the planned fiscal consolidation wasexpected to lead to further reductions in headcount.
Capacity utilisation
Overall, contacts reported that there remained an ampledegree of spare capacity in the economy, although increases indemand had led to an incremental rise in capacity utilisation.Indeed there were sporadic concerns that stronger increases indemand would put pressure on some supply chains, especiallythose where capacity had been cut or where operations hadbeen consolidated.  And a few other companies, usuallyoperating in the manufacturing sector, reported that they wereworking at or even above current capacity, following earlierreductions in their headcount.  Most contacts reported littledifficulty filling vacancies, although recruitment of highlyskilled individuals was proving more difficult in some sectors.
Costs and prices
Labour costs
Overall, pay growth remained muted, although pay freezeshad become less common and the upward creep in wagesettlements, noted over the past couple of months, hadbecome more widespread.  Most contacts had agreed to smallincreases in pay to reward staff for a much improved tradingperformance, or in some cases to retain staff in the face of anexpected upturn in demand.  Generally, contacts reported thatpay negotiations had not been materially influenced by recentinflation outturns, although some businesses had becomemore concerned about the impact that higher inflation mighthave on employees’ future wage demands.  Total labour costs had been rising for a number of months, as
the restoration of hours and overtime, as well as smallincreases in bonuses and commissions, had led to increases inemployees’ take-home pay.  
Non-labour costs
Most contacts reported further increases in materials costs in June ( Chart 3 ).  In some markets, such as those for fuel and
timber, contacts thought that increased demand (particularlyfrom emerging economies such as China) had been thedominant factor pushing up prices.  But in other markets —including freight, paper, construction materials and electronics— supply shortages following reductions in global capacityduring the recession had also played a significant role.Imported goods prices had also continued to rise.  Contactsattributed the latest increase to a combination of risingChinese inflation, and the recent fall of sterling against thedollar (which had increased the prices of dollar-based importsfrom the Far East).  
The rise in businesses’ non-labour costs had not been
universal, however.  For example, energy costs had fallen formany contacts, who had renewed expiring contacts at lowerrates.  And many businesses had also benefited from lowerrents or longer rent-free periods, reflecting the significantoverhang of empty properties, and landlords’ desire to retaintenants and prevent voids.
Output prices
Manufacturers’ output prices had edged higher over themonth, as the impact of spare capacity continued to be offsetby pass-through of materials and fuel costs through escalator
clauses and surcharges respectively.  Some services prices hadalso begun to increase quarter on quarter, although the Agentsjudged that, on balance, prices remained below their levels ayear earlier ( Chart 4 ).  By contrast, output prices in the
construction sector continued to decline, with manybusinesses bidding for work at, or even below cost, in anattempt to secure cash flow.
Despite only limited increases in output prices, the Agents
reported that pre-tax profitability had been recovering during2010, as increases in commodity and component prices hadbeen offset by reductions in labour and operational costsmade during 2009.  As a result, businesses’ margins had, onbalance, been broadly unchanged over the past year (see box). 
Consumer prices
Annual consumer price inflation remained elevated, reflectingthe earlier restoration of the standard rate of VAT to 17.5%,and increases in imported goods prices.  Looking ahead, trendsin both goods and services prices were expected to be mixed.For example, clothing and footwear prices were expected torise in the near term, reflecting further pass-through from thelower level of sterling.  But food price inflation was expectedto ease back over the remainder of 2010.  
A rise in VAT (confirmed in the June 2010 Budget) had been
widely expected by contacts.  But, given that the vast majorityof the Agents’ meetings had occurred prior to the Budget , it
remained too early to assess the degree to which the rise in taxwould be passed on to consumers.  4

–Agents’ survey on corporate margins
UK inflation has been surprisingly resilient since the onset of
the recession in mid-2008.  One possible explanation relatesto the behaviour of corporate margins.  In the past, profitmargins have tended to fall back during periods of weakdemand, perhaps because companies chose to keep pricesdown temporarily and forego current profits in order tosupport demand for their products.  But during the latestrecession, estimated profit margins have been unusuallyresilient, falling no more than during the early 1990s recession,despite a larger fall in output.
(1)
To investigate this further, the Agents asked contacts how theirgross profit margins had evolved over the past year, the mainfactors that had driven any change, how their marginscompared to more ‘normal’ levels, and how they expectedmargins to change going forward.  Around 350 businessesresponded to the survey.  All figures shown are weighted byturnover.  
Consistent with the official ONS data, the Agents’ survey
results suggested that, on balance, corporate margins hadbeen little changed over the past year ( Chart A ), although the
distribution of responses was quite wide.  Firms operating inthe construction sector were more likely to report significantdeclines in profit margins, while those in the consumer servicessector tended to report small increases.  Exporters’ responsessuggested that their profit margins had risen significantly overthe past year.  
The results also suggested that, overall, businesses thought
their margins were currently a little below normal levels(Chart B ).  Again that is consistent with the ONS data, which
show that the profit share is currently a little below its pre-recession level.  Exporters typically reported that marginswere currently well above normal levels, consistent with the
sharp rise in sterling export prices since the depreciation ofsterling in mid-2007.
Contacts reported that weak demand and strong competition
had contributed to downward pressure on their margins.Similarly, many reported that margins had been squeezed byincreases in raw material costs, which few had been able topass on in full.  In aggregate, however, these influences hadbeen broadly offset by reductions in labour costs andimprovements to operational efficiency, most of which hadhappened during 2009.  
Looking ahead, few contacts expected to be able to replicate
the reductions in costs they had achieved over the past year.And, on balance, there was little evidence to suggest that firmsbelieved they would be able to raise prices over the nexttwelve months.  As a result, most contacts expected marginsto remain steady over the next year ( Chart A ).
