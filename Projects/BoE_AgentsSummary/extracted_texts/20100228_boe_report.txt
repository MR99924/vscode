February 2010Demand
Consumption
The Agents’ sense was that retail sales had recovered
somewhat during 2009 Q4, and retailers reported that salesover Christmas and the New Year period had been well up on ayear earlier, reflected in further increases in the Agents’ score(Chart 1 ).  Initial indications were, however, that demand had
fallen back in early January, when the heavy snowfall waswidely reported to have impacted adversely on sales.
Demand for consumer services also appeared to have picked
up since mid-2009, although any recovery had been lessmarked than for retail sales ( Chart 1 ).  Hotels and restaurants
reported that sales volumes had been higher than a year earlierin the run-up to Christmas.  Holiday bookings had also grown,although there were widespread reports that the inclementweather had affected demand.
One result of the adverse weather was that retailers found it
hard to distinguish between a temporary fall in demand andany change in ‘trend’.  Nonetheless, many expected demand toslow through the early part of 2010.  In part, that reflectedtheir view that customers had brought spending forward inanticipation of the rise in VAT — demand for big-ticket items,such as furniture, had grown sharply in the immediate run-upto the New Year.  But more generally, many had been surprisedby the strength of demand during late 2009.
Housing market
The number of property transactions remained higher than ayear earlier but was still well below pre-recession levels.  Butthere was mounting evidence that growth had slowed inrecent months.  While there were further signs of a marginaleasing in mortgage availability, these continued to bedominated by reports that a lack of finance was constrainingactivity.  Such constraints appeared most marked in themarket for new homes, where a number of estate agentscontinued to report that surveyors were providing conservative
valuations.
Business investment
Investment plans continued to be widely described as muted,with very few contacts anticipating significant growth incapital expenditure.  But while the level of investmentremained lower than before the recession, there were fewreports of plans for a further round of sharp cuts following theprevious year’s reductions.
Concerns over prospects for demand continued to be cited
widely as a factor deterring investment spending, with manycontacts considering their capital utilisation to be well belownormal (see below) and few expecting demand to growsignificantly during 2010.  A number of contacts had deferredinvestment until after the general election, when any changesin taxes, capital allowances and government spending wouldcome to light.  On the upside, a number of contacts needed toincrease investment in vehicles, machinery and IT, followingdeferral of routine replacement programmes during 2009.  
Exports
There had been little change to the broad picture of modestrecovery in exports painted in recent months, with globaldemand widely seen to have strengthened through the latterpart of 2009.  Although some exporters had experiencedincreases in competitiveness and market share in the wake ofsterling’s depreciation, many others had continued to take anybenefit through increases in their margins.  But there was someevidence that more businesses were looking to enter exportmarkets.  For example, Chambers of Commerce reportedgrowth in demand for the export documentation services theyprovide.
Inventories
As had been the case throughout 2009 Q4, inventories werewidely described as being around desired levels.  Lookingforward, the Agents’ sense was that few firms were increasingtheir stocks, with many firms planning to hold lower stocklevels (relative to sales) than had been the case prior to therecession.  In large part, that was driven by the loweravailability and higher cost of working capital.  Contacts alsocited uncertainty over prospects for demand as a factorpressing down on planned inventories.  
Output
Business services
Reports of stabilisation or modest growth in demand forprofessional and financial services had become more commonin recent months.  But any recovery in demand was lessevident than in the consumer services sector ( Chart 2 ), with
many contacts stressing that growth had come from a lowbase.  For example, although demand for property-related and2

other transactional work had grown in recent months, activity
remained well below pre-recession levels.  The overarchingimpression remained one of customers managing theiroverheads extremely tightly.
Outside the professional services sector, any evidence of
recovery in business services was even more patchy.  Spendingon corporate hospitality remained very weak relative topre-recession levels — for example, a greater number ofChristmas parties had been paid for by employees rather thantheir employers.  And the extreme weather had impacted on anumber of business services providers, with reports ofcancellation of conferences and some disruption todistribution.
Manufacturing
The broad picture remained one of activity growing since itstrough in the summer of 2009.  But although reports ofexpansion outweighed those of shrinkage, there was still littlesense that growth had picked up strongly or consistently.Contacts continued to report volatility in orders and shorterthan normal order books.  And looking forward, few werebanking on strong growth through 2010.  Some firms had seenoutput disrupted by the weather, but such reports were verymuch in the minority.
Construction
Construction activity remained well down on the same perioda year earlier.  Commercial property activity was particularlyweak, with no material pipeline of new projects to replacethose being completed.  Some Agents had been told that the pipeline of public sector projects was dwindling, althoughsuch reports were far from universal, with a few public sectorbodies still bringing work forward.  House-building activityhad, however, continued to pick up a little, with some further reports of land purchases and site preparation work.Spending on repair and maintenance work was broadly stable.Credit conditions
The Agents’ sense of marginal improvement in creditavailability had strengthened in recent months.  But, as hadbeen the case for some time, that loosening had not been feltuniformly across contacts.  Access to finance continued to bedelineated by firm size and sector.  For example, reports ofimproved credit availability were more common among largercompanies and those operating outside the property sector.On average, lending spreads had probably narrowed a littlethrough the second half of 2009, though they remained widerelative to pre-crisis levels.  Reports of high fees and toughnon-price terms (such as management informationrequirements) remained pervasive.  Demand for financeremained weak.
Employment
In most parts of the United Kingdom, the pace of decline inemployment had slowed through 2009 Q4, with few reportsof significant redundancies and some of selective rehiring.Looking forward, the outlook for employment continued toimprove slightly ( Chart 3 ), with few contacts planning
significant cuts to staff numbers during 2010.  But there werealso few plans to increase permanent headcount, with manycontacts expecting to respond to any increase in demand byreversing earlier cuts to average hours or taking on temporarystaff.
Capacity utilisation
The recent pickup in demand experienced by some firms hadled to increases in their capacity utilisation.  A few contactshad started to face capacity constraints — for example, somereported lengthening lead times where demand had surgedand others encountered sporadic recruitment difficulties forspecific skill sets.  But such reports remained rare and were setagainst a backdrop of widespread spare capacity.Chart 3 Employment intentions

–Costs and prices
Labour costs
Private sector contacts had continued to describe their per
capita labour costs as down relative to the same period a yearearlier.  Looking forward, the Agents had conducted a SpecialSurvey of prospects for per capita pay and labour costs (seebox).  The overarching sense from that survey was thatinflation in labour costs was expected to be positive butsubdued during 2010.  A significant number of contactsplanned to freeze pay, and very few expected to makesettlements in excess of 2%.  But total per capita labour costswere expected to rise a little faster than during the previousyear — in part, because some firms anticipated making higherpension contributions.
Non-labour costs
The Agents’ sense was that inflation in materials costs hadpicked up a little since the summer ( Chart 4 ).  In part, that was
because last year’s falls in fuel prices had previously drivenannual inflation rates lower.  Diesel prices had increased
through the second half of 2009, as had the price of some oilderivatives such as plastics.  And global supply pressures hadled to increases in the price of some other commodities.Looking forward, contacts expected a further, slight pickup innon-labour costs — albeit to nothing like the same extent asexperienced during 2008.
Output prices
Substantial spare capacity had continued to push down outputprices for many firms.  That pressure remained most clearlyevident in the construction and business services sectors,where prices achieved were widely regarded as well down onthe previous year.  Against that backdrop, there had beenfurther signs that downward pressures on pricing had eased(Chart 4 ).  More manufacturers anticipated making modest
increases in prices, or holding prices stable, where they hadpreviously expected small decreases.  Some business servicesproviders had also reported stable charge rates through thelatter part of 2009, after sharp falls earlier in the year.
Consumer prices
The Agents’ contacts reported that consumer goods priceinflation had increased sharply, reflecting both the reversal ofthe temporary cut in VAT and the limited scale of promotionalactivity.  Retail contacts reported that they had entered theChristmas period with lower stocks than the previous year.That, coupled with stronger sales, had left them with less stockto shift compared with a year earlier.  As a result, promotionswere less widespread, and were typically tailored to just a fewproduct lines.  Many retailers had passed through, or expectedto pass through, much of the VAT increase onto theircustomers.  The VAT rise had also affected prices in theconsumer services sector.  But here, promotional activityremained pervasive.4

–Agents’ survey on prospects for pay and per
capita labour costs
A significant number of private sector pay settlements take
place during the first four months of the year.  To provide anearly indication of prospects for pay in the year ahead, theAgents conduct a survey of their contacts each January.  Thisyear, around 325 private sector firms responded.  All figuresshown are weighted by UK employment.
Contacts were asked what they expected their pay settlement
to be during 2010.  The average across all respondents was1.3%, down from 1.9% in the 2009 survey.  As in 2009, asignificant proportion expected to freeze pay this year(Chart A ).  But, in contrast to 2009, very few respondents
anticipated making settlements in excess of 2%.  This pictureof low settlements was common across all sectors of theeconomy, but was most marked among firms in theconstruction sector.  That chimed with the Agents’ reports thatconstruction has been one of the weakest sectors of theeconomy for some time.
Basic pay is only a part of firms’ total labour costs — changes
in overtime, bonuses and pension contributions also play arole.  Survey respondents were asked how they expected theirtotal per capita labour costs to evolve during 2010.  Despitelow expected pay settlements, the majority of respondentsexpected per capita labour costs to grow more quickly (orshrink more slowly) than in the previous year ( Chart B ).
Respondents were also asked which factors most explained
any expected changes in per capita labour costs.  On theupside, pension contributions were widely expected toincrease ( Chart C ) — most markedly among larger firms.  TheAgents’ discussions with contacts suggested that a number
had seen downward revaluations of their pension funds, partlyreflecting lower gilt yields, and were planning to respond byincreasing employer contributions.  On the downside, theoutlook for inflation and some firms’ difficulties in passing anycost increases on to their customers were cited as pressingdown on the remuneration respondents expected to offer.
