April 2013Demand
Consumption
Annual retail sales values growth had edged higher ( Chart 1 ).
There had been a gentle recovery in retail sales values sincethe middle of 2012, though that had partly reflected a gradualrise in retail price inflation.  Underlying consumer demandgrowth was reported to remain subdued, consistent with tightdisposable incomes for many.  The picture of strength in salesat the premium and discounted ends of the spectrumcontinued, with the middle squeezed.  That was also reflectedin the pattern of car demand, which was focused on luxurybrands on the one hand, or on highly fuel efficient or ‘discount’models on the other, and was generally said to have remainedstrong.  Consumer services demand growth remained modestand was similarly polarised.  For example, demand for foreigntravel was reported to be strengthening, and self-cateringdemand at home was said to be strong;  but a long tail of UK-based, mid-market hotels were said to be struggling.  Forthe most part though, discretionary spending had remainedweak and highly price sensitive.  As might have been expected,the horsemeat furore was reported to have affected thecomposition rather than quantity of food demand — withstronger sales of unprocessed meat by independent butchers,offset by lower sales elsewhere.  
Housing market
There were further reports of improving housing marketactivity, both for new home sales and secondary markettransactions.  That had continued to reflect falls in mortgagerates — including at high loan to value ratios — and animprovement in mortgage availability, as well as the effects ofspecific government-backed incentive schemes for homeownership.  An Agents’ survey of companies close to thehousing market also found a marked improvement inmortgage conditions over the past year (see the box onpages 6–7).  The easing in credit conditions — in part due tothe effects of the Funding for Lending Scheme — was seen bymany contacts as causing some ‘freeing up’ of the housingmarket, with some potential buyers — including first-time
buyers — encouraged to return to the market.  However, therewere reports that sales were taking longer to complete thanhad historically been the case, reflecting tighter scrutiny ofmortgage applications than in the past and buyer uncertaintyin some cases.  
Business investment
Investment intentions for the coming twelve months remainedmuted.  Although the recent slight improvement in confidencehad been sustained, concerns about the wider macroeconomicenvironment remained high and investment was often aimedat improving efficiency or replacing existing assets.  Increasinginvestment in IT was frequently reported, in part to expandand develop ‘online’ activities or model business plans.  Amongmanufacturers, however, there were some increased reports ofinvestment in research and development and productinnovation in general, and in autos and aerospace supplychains in particular.  There were also widespread reports ofincreased spending on new large commercial vehicles, tocomply with new emissions regulations.  But investment bymany consumer-facing and heavy construction-related firmsremained weak.  There were a few reports that deficits inlegacy defined benefit pension schemes had held backinvestment due to the effects on available funds, in most casesfrom firms for which access to finance was difficult or costly.
Exports
Manufacturing exports ( Chart 2 ) had continued to pick up
gently on a year earlier, as a result of gains in market share andsome strengthening in global demand outside of the euro area.The recent depreciation of sterling was not as yet materiallyaffecting export volumes.  There were only isolated reports ofexporters becoming more competitive overseas, as prices wereoften set for a long period in advance.  There were also somereports of companies trying to export for the first time or tonew markets, sometimes reflecting the weakness of UK oreuro-area demand.  Some contacts suggested that the 2

turnoverweakness of UK export performance relative to some 
euro-area competitors might have reflected weaker exportnetworks in the Far East prior to the financial crisis:  buildingup those networks took time.  Among sectors, exports relatedto the oil and gas industry and by food processors werereported to be increasing.  There were also some reports ofrising exports from the professional services sector.
On the import side, increasing Chinese labour costs, higher
freight costs and an appreciation of the renminbi continued tolead to a shift in sourcing towards other markets, both in Asiaand closer to home.  That included a continuing flow of reportsof production moving back to the United Kingdom, centred ongoods that were complex or expensive to transport, though ata slow pace that some contacts said reflected an absence ofsuitable existing productive capacity.  In the opposite direction,reports continued of lower-value work moving overseas.Contacts continued to report rising imports of food, reflectingpoor UK harvests.     
Output
Business services
Annual growth in business services turnover had edged highersince the turn of the year ( Chart 2 ).  Within the professional
services sector, a gradual increase in advisory work related tocorporate mergers and acquisitions activity and asset disposalswas said to have continued.  There were also reports of growthin corporate litigation activity, in part as tight margins leftlittle room for negotiation in contract disputes.  But demandfor audit and tax was reported to be flat, in line with the widereconomy.  Commercial property-related work was said to berising slightly, in some cases because tighter regulatoryrequirements were leading banks to seek more valuations orreduce forbearance, leading to new transactions.  And annualgrowth in other business services was reported to have edgedup, alongside some more positive reports from transport anddistribution and warehousing companies, ascribed to theeffects of online retailing and thin inventories along somesupply chains.  Demand for IT services was on balance alsoreported to be rising.  But for many other companies — such asin the corporate hospitality, conference and business travelsubsectors — turnover had remained subdued. 
Manufacturing
Manufacturing output for the domestic market was reportedto have remained broadly flat on a year earlier ( Chart 2 ),
though there were further reports of some modestimprovement of forward-looking sentiment in export supplychains.  Areas of growth within the sector remained thoserelated to utilities and oil and gas production, aerospace,luxury and fuel-efficient cars, high-tech electronics and foodprocessing.  Output remained weak among manufacturers ofmany consumer goods and construction materials, althoughthere were reports of greater optimism among suppliers to
private house builders.   
Construction
The annual rate of decline in construction output haddiminished ( Chart 3 ).  There were increased reports of signs of
a gradual recovery in private housebuilding, with manycontacts reporting increased starts, building plans, or new land transactions, including the release of land by localauthorities whose planning processes, some contactssuggested, had eased.  Access to secondary capital marketshad improved financial conditions for larger housingassociations, though overall activity in that sector remainedweak.  There were also some increased reports of town centreredevelopment projects and of building in the education andhealth sectors.  But while those projects, and some large railand energy infrastructure projects, provided support to thesector, elsewhere weak levels of publicly funded and privatesector commercial construction were reported as continuingto act as a drag on activity.  
Credit conditions
Contacts reported that the availability of credit had improvedfor larger and some medium-sized corporates in recentmonths, but not for most small firms — a pattern mirrored inan Agents’ survey of changes in corporate credit conditionsover the past year (see the box on pages 6–7).  Most businesseswere able to access credit for ‘business as usual’, but accessingcredit to finance business change, or working capital to fundthe extra costs associated with expansion, continued to bemore difficult.  Non-financial contacts generally reported thatbanks’ risk appetite remained unchanged.  The cost of availablenew lending had fallen for many over recent months, thoughfor some the effect on interest rates paid had been offset bythe refinancing of facilities arranged on narrow spreads beforethe financial crisis.  Many contacts noted that the main effectof lower rates had been to reduce borrowing costs for existingAgents’ summary of business conditions April 2013 3

–Chart 3 Construction output‘low-risk’ borrowers, with an increase in competition reported
for lending to those firms.  Demand for bank lending hadremained weak, with many companies looking to reduce debtsor build up cash reserves, in part reflecting a continuing lack oftrust in banking relationships.  Some growth in peer to peerlending and in financing from funding circles and private equitywas reported, albeit from a low base.  However, a number ofsmall and medium-sized enterprise contacts reported thatlarger customers were extending the periods over which theysettled invoices, adding to pressures on working capital.  Therewere continued reports that forbearance on corporate loanswas gradually diminishing, especially on commercial propertyexposures.  
Employment 
Employment intentions remained little changed.  In businessservices, plans for increased employment often focused onfirms that were winning or attempting to win market share, for example through looking to invest in staff for newspecialisms or for marketing.  Those companies that werelosing market share were reported to have been slow to adjustemployment levels downwards and lose skilled staff.  In theprofessional services sector, the effect on employment ofsome consolidation was reported to be offset by plans toincrease graduate or junior hiring to maintain a skills mix.Manufacturing employment intentions had remained stableand little changed, but consumer services employment wasreported to be edging lower due in part to a gradual closing ofunprofitable stores.  Recruitment difficulties had continued tobe largely limited to IT and engineering staff, though thenumber of reports of localised shortages in skills outside thesesectors had edged higher.
Capacity utilisation
Capacity utilisation had remained a little below normal in bothmanufacturing and services and was unchanged on the month.There were reports across manufacturing and services sectorsthat investments made to increase efficiency had also raisedeffective capacity for some firms, offsetting the effects oncapacity utilisation of gently rising output in some sectors, orconsolidation within others.  There were some reports ofconsolidation being restrained by uncertainty about theultimate size of some companies’ legacy defined benefitpension scheme liabilities and by the extent of assetencumbrance.  Within sectors, some tightness of capacity wasreported in high-tech engineering, luxury car supply chains andaerospace.  And professional services reported only limitedamounts of spare capacity, though the picture often remainedone of staff working hard to maintain output in anenvironment of weak demand and of gradual consolidation.Spare capacity remained most obvious in the retail and heavyconstruction sectors.  Costs and prices
Labour costs
The annual rate of growth in labour costs per employee hadremained subdued, though had edged up a little inmanufacturing.  Pay freezes were reported to be slightly lesscommon, though where general pay rises were reported thatwas often said to reflect employers’ efforts to address issues of‘fairness’ — focusing on the living costs of less well-paid staff— rather than any rise in labour market pressures.  However,there were some reports of skills shortages in IT andengineering putting upward pressure on pay in thosespecialisms.  Pension costs were reported to be increasing, inpart reflecting auto-enrolment, although the costs of thatwould vary across businesses depending on their existingpension scheme arrangements and employees’ opt-out rates.Increased contributions to cover deficits on legacy definedbenefit pension schemes were said to be raising pension costsfor some, though that was rarely reported to be affectingcompanies’ wage-setting.  
Non-labour costs
The rate of inflation was reported to have edged higher forimported finished goods, and to a lesser extent for materialscosts, but remained modest.  Costs continued to be driven upby the direct and indirect effects of energy and agriculturalcommodity price rises.  In the latter case, concerns about foodsourcing were said to be driving up red meat prices inparticular.  Some contacts reported that sterling’s recentdepreciation had started to put upward pressure on the costsof imported inputs and finished goods, and would feed throughgradually with the usual lags, though the effect on food pricesmight be greater than normal given poor UK harvests hadincreased the reliance on food imports.  However, thesepressures were partly offset by falls in prices for timber andsome metals.

reported some pass-through of cost increases, albeit often
only partial.  Some professional services firms reportedavoiding bidding for low margin work, encouraged in part bysome recent increase in business volumes.  And in otherbusiness services, there were some increased reports of rises infuel costs being passed through.  The profitability ofmanufacturing and services firms was reported to beunchanged on a year earlier.  Contacts expected that anyrecovery in margins over the next year or two would be drivenby cost reductions or the introduction of higher marginproducts, alongside a gradual pickup in activity, rather thanincreased pricing.  Consumer prices
The annual rate of consumer price inflation was reported tohave edged up for goods, remaining unchanged for services.The slight increase for goods price inflation was said to reflecthigher food prices, and some contacts expected a furtherincrease in food price inflation during the year, in partreflecting the effects of sterling’s recent depreciation.  Alcoholprices were also reported to be increasing.  And furtherincreases in household energy prices were expected by somecontacts as the year progressed.  Manufactured goods priceinflation remained modest but was expected to rise further outas the effect of sterling depreciation fed through.  In services,inflation was seen as remaining largely concentrated inadministered prices, including in public transport and socialhousing rents.  More widely, the high price sensitivity ofconsumers was reported to be acting to restrain companiesfrom seeking to pass through price rises for goods or services.Agents’ survey on credit conditions
During February and March, the Agents conducted two
surveys, covering corporate credit and residential mortgagelending.
In the survey of corporate lending, firms were asked about
changes in credit conditions in the past twelve months, andthe impact of this on their use of credit and on their businessmore broadly.  They were also asked about their likely use ofbank borrowing over the next twelve months.  Three hundredand seventy firms responded to this survey.  In the followingdiscussion, the reported results are weighted by firm turnover.  It is important to note that, in interpreting theresults, many firms have infrequent interaction with lenders on borrowing requirements and, as such, it can take time forchanges in credit conditions to filter through.  This may beparticularly the case in this survey, given the relatively smallsample size.
The survey showed that for large firms,
(1)there had been an
improvement in credit availability compared with a yearearlier, and a small net balance reported a reduction in totalborrowing costs due to lower interest rates ( Chart A ).  For
medium-sized firms, a net balance had seen an improvementin availability, but some increase in costs, while among thesmall firms surveyed, slight net balances reported adeterioration in the availability and cost of borrowing.  Theresults were not markedly different between broad sectoralgroups, although firms in construction and propertydevelopment had seen a smaller improvement in creditavailability and faced higher borrowing costs, compared with ayear earlier, than those in manufacturing and services.  Overall, the reported effect of changes in credit conditions on
firms’ use of credit over the period had been limited.  Althougha small net balance of respondents had increased theirborrowing over the past twelve months, some 80% of thetotal sample reported that changes in credit conditions hadnot affected their use of credit.  
Firms were also asked about the impact of changes in credit
conditions on their holdings of cash, use of credit fromsuppliers, granting of credit to customers, use of workingcapital, and investment and employment plans.  The netbalance of firms reporting that changed credit conditions hadinfluenced their decisions was relatively small — less than 10%of the overall sample for any of these factors.  Within thesample, for firms reporting looser credit conditions over thepast year, the effect on most factors — including orders,investment and staffing — was positive.  For those firmsreporting tighter credit conditions over the past year, however,the effects were more marked, with net balances of at least10% reporting reduced working capital, credit terms offered tocustomers and investment plans, and with a marked increasein cash balances ( Chart B ).
Firms were relatively positive overall about their likely use of
bank borrowing over the next twelve months, with the surveyresults indicating that the growth in borrowing among firmssurveyed might be slightly faster in the coming year, comparedwith the past twelve months.
The survey of mortgage lending was completed by about
120 mortgage brokers, estate agents and house builders.  It
