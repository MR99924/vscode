January 2013Demand
Consumption
Growth in retail sales had continued at a slow rate.  A number
of contacts had expected a late surge in spending over the longweekend that led up to Christmas day (the box on page 5summarises an Agents’ survey of consumer spending over theChristmas period).  Growth in food sales had been supportedby rising price inflation, but underlying volume growth hadappeared weak.  Colder weather had contributed to a pickup inwinter clothing sales, and there had been further signs of aslightly firmer market for some durables;  demand for mobiledevices, for instance tablet computers, had been growingrapidly.  Continued double-digit growth in internet retail hadbeen widely reported.
Growth in demand for consumer services also remained very
modest.  As with sales of consumer goods, there were signsthat demand had continued to be stronger at low and highprice points than in the mid-market.  Sales of tickets for majorsporting and leisure events had remained strong and demandfor hotel accommodation had firmed up a little.  Some travelagents had reported a pickup in demand for luxury foreignholidays.  Domestic demand for rented accommodation hadcontinued to strengthen, but with more signs of resistance tohigh prices.  As households reduced private car travel, publictransport usage had grown further.  Consumers had beeneconomising on catering services such as restaurants and pubs.
Housing market
Growth in secondary market sales had been weaker than innew housing during the autumn.  Demand had been strongestfor property priced below the £250,000 stamp duty thresholdand, outside London, relatively subdued above that level.Some estate agents felt vendors’ expectations remained toohigh, notably those of households looking to downsize;  thiswould continue to hold back the supply of homes for sale.Additionally, some prospective second-time buyers had seenthe value of their existing property ease back, and this wouldrestrain demand.  There had been a number of recent reportsof mortgage supply improving and interest rates falling, withcompetition increasing between banks and building societies.But increasing competitiveness had been focused on the lowerloan to value (LTV) part of the market and those buyerswithout a significant deposit still struggled to purchase.Contacts expected the Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) tosupport greater activity in the new year and gradually toimprove the availability of mortgages at higher LTV ratios. 
Business investment
Investment intentions over the next twelve months remainedslightly positive in both the manufacturing and services sectors(Chart 1 ).  Contacts’ plans had become less finance
constrained during the past year but projects affording quickreturns or increasing competitiveness were still beingprioritised, particularly investment in information and
communications technology (ICT).  For some contacts,recently announced increases to investment allowances wouldengender a higher level of spend in 2013 than previouslyplanned.  However, some manufacturers were now cuttingback, either after a period of strong investment growth or inanticipation of weak demand.  A major positive exception wasfirms in the energy sector.  In services, some spend followeddeferral and therefore would not persist, or had beenprompted by regulation rather than expansion.  But there hadbeen widespread reports of property refurbishment increasingand some business services firms were investing ahead ofanticipated growth in exports.
Exports
Manufacturing exports ( Chart 2 ) had steadied.  Sales to the
euro area were still declining;  demand for capital goods andfrom the automotive industry had fallen.  And the US ‘fiscalcliff’ had delayed orders for defence and healthcare goods.  Butdemand from the US oil, gas and energy sectors had remainedstrong.  Bright prospects had been evident in some emergingmarket economies.  Sales of luxury goods, cars, medicalequipment and education services were rising;  and demand forinfrastructure-related goods and services had also grown,though projects were slow to start.

the first time had showed no sign of abating.  But contacts had
highlighted a rising level of international competition fromEuropean firms and from some Asian factories.  Car importsfrom the euro area during 2012 H2 had been relativelybuoyant, and food imports had picked up.
Output
Business services
Professional, financial and other business services firms’turnover had continued to grow slowly.  Some professionalfirms’ volumes of M&A activity had increased slightly, as hadland use planning services, litigation and exports.  But turnovergrowth had continued to be held back by downward pressureon fees.  Tight margins had increased pressure to consolidateand encouraged further relocation of some work to lower-costlocations.  In financial services, there had been a sharp pickupin the volume of pension and annuity-related activity.  Someemployment agencies had reported better prospects, notablythose specialising in sales and business development positions.ICT services firms were also growing.  The logistics industryhad seen rising demand for parcel delivery services, reflectingthe rapid growth in e-commerce.  But though corporate usageof hotel and conference facilities had firmed up, firms’discretionary spend was not rising.  Advertising showed signsof having been trimmed back since the Olympics. 
Manufacturing
The gentle easing of domestic market sales had not altered inrecent months.  But growth in output for export ( Chart 1 ) had
steadied, though at well below the pace of six months ago.Business prospects were strongly polarised.  Further neworders for civil aircraft had added to the strong forwardvisibility in the aerospace sector.  Demand for equipment fromthe oil and gas sector was strengthening.  And 2013 would seeadditional models launched by UK car producers, for some ofwhom production was now ramping up.  Output of someconsumer durables had also risen in recent months.  Butoutput of construction goods had continued to weaken andthe outlook for many defence contractors remained subdued.Brewing volumes had fallen and a number of food processorshad seen lower order levels than expected.
Construction
Output was still less than a year ago, though the decline hadshown further signs of flattening off.  Output of new homeswas broadly stable, skewed towards homes for sale and awayfrom new social housing, thanks to incentive schemes for theformer and uncertain financial support for the latter.  Homebuilders generally remained cautious, though some werebudgeting for a slightly higher output in 2013.  Poorprospective returns had restrained commercial new build.  InLondon and in some other regions, a higher proportion of workwas now in refurbishment.  There were only patchy reports ofany pickup in public spending, albeit in the medium term thesector would benefit from infrastructure schemes that had
been announced. 
Credit conditions
Several major banks had begun to market the FLS energeticallyto firms in recent weeks.  The supply of term lending hadbecome more price competitive.  But non-price conditionswere proving slower to improve and available loans hadremained generally limited to shorter maturities.  Demand fornew business lending from banks had remained muted, exceptamong the smallest firms, for whom a lack of security stillrestrained supply.  Business advisers had commented thatbanks’ risk appetite appeared little changed.  Banks themselveshad continued to speak of a lack of demand from firms withsolid business plans, but lower interest rates under the FLScould begin to make it easier for loan applicants to passaffordability tests.  Some contacts had noted a growingpreference among businesses for finance from private equityfirms, venture capital funds and business angels. 
Many firms preferred to use cash, not borrowings, for
expansion.  Some contacts had continued to pay down debt asquickly as possible.  A number had described the build-up intheir cash balances as being in large part as a bulwark againstrisks to working capital.  Settlement of invoices was said to beslowing, and several manufacturers had seen customersunilaterally extend payment terms.  Working capital hadtightened significantly in the farming sector.  Some contactshad noted that trade credit insurance availability hadtightened in recent months, both for exporters and moregenerally. 
Employment 
Employment intentions were rising in business services.  Inpart this reflected a stronger demand for school leavers andgraduates, to meet future needs.  And though someprofessional firms were shedding posts in the higher salarybands, others were hiring selectively at this level, to broadentheir range of services ahead of a revival in demand.  Inconsumer services, numbers employed continued to driftdown, in part because of business failures;  many employershad sought greater staff flexibility and some guaranteedfewer working hours than before.  Manufacturingemployment prospects remained broadly flat.  Contactsgenerally expected a revival in manufacturing output to bemet from current slack labour before any further recruitment.Prospects in the construction industry remained poor, withfurther labour shedding possible.  Recruitment difficulties(Chart 3 ) remained a little below normal but were gradually
creeping up. Engineering skill shortages had been reportedfrom the power generation industry.  And ICT skills for arange of activities, including both publishing andprogramming, had tightened.  A number of contacts inthese areas, including professionals, were looking abroad for
skills.  For many low-skilled positions there was an oversupplyof suitable applicants.
Capacity utilisation
Capacity constraints had remained a little below normal.  Anumber of producers were protecting spare capacity, some of itrelatively new, until business conditions improved.  Falls indomestic demand had triggered several firm closures.  Someexport-facing manufacturers were now under a little lesspressure than earlier in the year;  but others expected to phasein any further capacity required or to handle volatile orderpatterns through short-term overtime working.  Some of theslack in the service sector was being addressed by mergers.  In afew locations, the supply of grade-A office space had becometight following several years of very low investment.  But therehad continued to be a hangover of secondary and tertiary officespace, and the retail vacancy rate had continued to climb.
Costs and prices
Labour costs
Pay growth had remained slightly faster in manufacturing thanin the service sector.  However there had been suggestions of adecline in the overall amount of overtime being worked.  Andsome contacts expected lower bonus payments in 2013 thanthe previous year, reflecting falling profitability.  Many firmswere now considering what impact auto-enrolment mighthave on their wage bill.  The advent of the new requirementwas not expected to affect the majority of pay decisions in theshort term, but a few firms were bringing new pensionschemes forward.
Non-labour costs
Having softened over the summer, growth in non-labour costshad edged up very slightly.  Hard commodity and oil derivativeinflation had been subdued, reflecting weaker demand fromAsia and the stable price of oil.  Cereal prices had fallen back,but higher grain costs were now affecting early-stage foodproduction — bakeries, animal feed and egg production, forexample.  Weakening export demand had contributed to
softening prices for some foods, and the cost of some othershad benefited from the appreciation of sterling.  Fast-risingAsian labour rates, and higher shipping costs, were adding tothe upward pressure on finished goods such as cottons.  Anincreasing number of firms were facing higher energy bills,though many continued to seek some offset from efficiencymeasures.
Output prices and margins
Producers’ domestic prices had drifted up a little, but they hadnot fully recouped rising costs.  Some manufacturers felt thatpressure on margins had intensified during the second half ofthe year ( Chart 4 ).  A margin squeeze had become apparent in
the food supply chain.  And advanced engineers’ customersstill expected suppliers to achieve price reductions year onyear.  In sectors such as energy extraction and generation therehad been greater scope for cautious margin improvement.And in the service sector business-to-business services priceshad continued their glacial rate of increase, though marginsstill reflected the lack of higher value-added work.  Prices forwaste management and utilities were steadily rising, but for awide range of other business services, absent a correction tolabour costs, margins were still tightening as downwardpressure on prices persisted.
Consumer prices
Non-food discounting in the run-up to Christmas had beenmore tightly managed than a year ago, retailers havingcommitted ahead to less stock.  Some food prices had risenbut fixed-price contracts and downward price pressure onfood processors were thought likely to continue to restrainfurther price growth.  Falls in the price of petrol andlat-autumn clearance sales had helped overall goods priceinflation to soften slightly.  Consumer services price inflationremained higher than for goods and was drifting up.  Hotelsand some travel agents had felt less need to discount than ayear ago.  Air fares continued to rise slowly.  The turn of theyear would see further pass-through of higher utility bills andrises in some public transport prices, though at a slower ratethan twelve months before. 4

–Chart 4 Pre-tax profits Agents’ survey of consumer spending over the
Christmas period
As in previous years, the Agents conducted a survey of
retailers, shopping centres and consumer services firms in lateDecember and early January to get a view of sales over theChristmas and New Year period.  Two hundred and thirty sixbusinesses responded.
Contacts were asked about trading relative to the same period
a year earlier.  Weighted by turnover, around 75% reportedgrowth in sales values ( Chart A ), with 14% seeing growth in
excess of 5%.  Additional selling space had accounted for someof this growth.  So, too, had price inflation (eg on foodproducts), with retail contacts reporting weaker growth involumes than values.  Most consumer services respondents,including many hotels, pubs and restaurants, had alsoexperienced sales growth.
The majority of contacts (also 75% when weighted by
turnover) reported their sales performance as either in linewith, or exceeding, expectations ( Chart B ).  Expectations had
been modest and trading conditions were broadly asanticipated.
Most businesses reported a pickup in trading in the final few
days before Christmas and at the start of their maindiscounting period.  Those with a strong online presence haddone well, though partly at the expense of sales in-store.Those with weaker online offerings had seen less online salesgrowth this year.  Also, some smaller stores were finding onlinetrading activity tougher.  Electrical items had sold extremelywell.
About half of contacts reported the timing of discounting as
broadly similar to a year ago.  The remainder were split evenlybetween those who had waited until after Christmas, andothers that had discounted earlier this year in a bid for market
share.  The level of discounting had been slightly deeper than ayear ago, but more targeted on specific items or ranges.Non-price promotional techniques had been used moreaggressively, for instance vouchers and loyalty schemes.  Astrong theme this year was one of better stock management.There were few reports of excess stocks from retailers as theyentered the post-Christmas discount period;  this was likely toboost margins when compared to a year ago.
Finally, contacts were asked about expected sales over the
next three months ( Chart C ).  Expectations were, on balance,
for very low nominal sales growth relative to the year before,although price inflation could contribute to food sales growth.Pressure on disposable incomes was expected to continue toact as a drag on growth.  Consumer services firms hoped to seerecent modest growth continue, but remained cautious.Among those with a more positive outlook were contactsselling household durables, who expected recent steadygrowth, described as primarily replacement spending, tocontinue.
