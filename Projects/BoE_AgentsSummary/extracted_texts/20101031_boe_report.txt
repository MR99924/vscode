October 2010Demand
Consumption
The Agents reported some further moderation in annual retail
spending growth from its peak earlier this year ( Chart 1 ).
Retailers noted that consumer confidence remained fragilegiven uncertainty around the extent and timing of publicsector spending cuts, and their impacts on disposable income.Value continued to be a key driver of demand, boosting, forexample, growth in internet sales, as sales volumes andfootfall in stores remained fairly flat.  New car sales werereported to have continued to decline relative to a year earlierbut the underlying trend was difficult to disentangle frompost-scrappage effects.  
Consumer service providers ( Chart 1 ) continued to see steady
turnover growth.  Domestic tourism had enjoyed slight furthergrowth compared to a strong 2009.  Promotional pricingremained an important driver of demand for leisure activity asspend per head continued to be restrained.
Housing market
Activity had remained weak.  Weaker potential purchaserconfidence, both in the macroeconomic outlook and the likelypath of house prices, had started to weigh on demand, alongwith restricted availability of mortgages for first-time buyers.For example, some potential purchasers were deferringdecisions to proceed on transactions.  Most contacts expectedhouse prices to stay flat or fall slightly in coming months,partly reflecting higher stocks of houses for sale.  Rentaldemand remained strong as many potential first-timepurchasers chose to rent instead, but robust supply growth ofrental properties was limiting any increases in rents.Continuing low debt-servicing costs for some landlords hadalso helped to limit rent increases. 
Business investment
A pickup in planned investment by manufacturers hadcontinued on the back of growth in demand, while plans forservices firms showed continuing stable but modest growth.
Total investment remained below pre-recession levels but hadcontinued to pick up through 2010, focusing on overduereplacement of ageing kit, efficiency enhancements and cost-saving through IT.  A need to boost capacity wasbecoming a more significant driver of increased investment,mainly for manufacturing exporters. 
Continuing external finance constraints meant capital
spending was more likely to be funded from internal resourcesthan it had been pre-crisis for most contacts.  But theseconstraints were acting as less of a restraint than a year earlieras firms had built up cash balances (see box).
Exports
Exports continued to grow robustly, particularly of goods, withcontacts citing increased global demand as the main driver.Euro-area activity remained patchy.  Orders from Germanyhad strengthened over the past quarter, but demand fromIreland and Spain had remained weak.  Reports on exports tothe United States were mixed, but demand from emergingmarkets remained strong, for example growing in professionalservices such as those related to engineering.  Inward tourismand higher education intakes to UK colleges and universitiesalso looked reasonably strong this year. 
Output
Business services 
The Agents’ scores for turnover of both professional andfinancial services and other business services firms increasedmodestly.  Pricing remained under downward pressure forprofessional and financial services firms, implying a slightlystronger recovery in volumes than implied by turnover (Chart 2 ).  But the impact of tightening public sector spending
continued to be a concern for many contacts in the sector.Financial services providers reported a slight increase incommercial transaction income, but contacts in property sawa continuing weak market with oversupply and little new build.  2

–Agents’ summary of business conditions October 2010 3
There were signs of demand picking up for other business
services firms, in areas such as business travel and roadhaulage, the latter partly reflecting manufacturing outputgrowth.  But many companies continued to keep a tight reinon such costs, particularly on items such as hospitality andconferencing, where private sector demand was recoveringonly very slowly from prior year lows.  And public sectordemand had started to ease over the summer, with furtherdeclines expected.
Manufacturing
Agents’ reports this month pointed to strengthening outputgrowth for the domestic market, assisted by export-led supplychain demand ( Chart 3 ).  A small but increasing number of
manufacturing exporters noted that output was back on a parwith pre-recession levels, although for most manufacturersthere remained a marked, albeit narrowing shortfall.  And thepickup in output for domestic markets remained lessconsistent than that seen by exporters.  There was concernabout the impact of government spending cuts starting toimpact future orders in subsectors with greater exposure suchas defence and construction.
Construction
Activity in the construction sector was reported to be roughlyon a par with last year’s weak levels.  But contacts in the sectorgenerally had a more pessimistic outlook than for othersectors for 2011.  Public sector work had started to edge down,and contacts felt the decline would accelerate in 2011, withnew orders unlikely to replace current work running off.  Tightfinance conditions for companies linked to the sector remaineda constraint for many contacts.
Credit conditions
Credit conditions continued to improve marginally but notuniformly, and terms and conditions enjoyed by borrowers remained tighter than pre-crisis levels.  Availability and termsof credit were improving for (mainly larger) companies outside
property and construction with lower levels of debt.  But credit for SMEs generally remained difficult, although animprovement in trade credit insurance terms was assistingcash flow.  Competition for new business among banksremained low.  Demand for credit continued to be weak,focusing mainly on refinancing, so net lending growth was alsoweak (see box).  
Employment
Private sector employment intentions had eased slightly afterimproving earlier in the year.  Of those expanding, mostpreferred to use temporary rather than permanentrecruitment, given caution about future demand prospects,and citing the need to maintain strict control over futurelabour costs.  Contacts that had held on to labour during thedownturn felt able to cope with rising demand with littleadditional headcount, mainly through increased productivity.Public sector headcount had only fallen slightly to date but therate of reduction was expected to accelerate through 2011–12.Recruitment difficulties remained lower than normal.     
Capacity utilisation
Spare capacity was reported to have tightened over recentmonths, particularly in manufacturing.  Nonetheless, capacityutilisation remained slightly below normal ( Chart 4 ).  The
tightening was greatest for exporters and their suppliers on the back of a strong pickup in external demand.  Somemanufacturing investment was therefore directed towardscapacity expansion.  But operations that formed part ofmultinational groups also noted that in many cases increasesin demand could currently be met by European sister plants,which had greater spare capacity.  There were reports ofpockets of capacity shortfalls in supply chains in the Far East inelectronic and power components, causing longer lead timeson some parts.  Contacts expected such issues to improve byearly 2011 as capacity was brought back on stream.  Servicesector contacts saw slower reduction in slack, andconsequently less need to invest in capacity than theircounterparts in manufacturing.   
Costs and prices
Labour costs
Pay settlements continued to rise modestly, as companyprofitability and productivity recovered.  Some contacts hadwished to acknowledge their workforces’ understanding,following a period of pay freezes and shorter working hours, byawarding pay increases, albeit modest ones.  Pay freezescontinued but were diminishing in number in the privatesector.  A growing number of companies were opting for salaryincreases for some members of staff rather than across theChart 3 Manufacturing output

–board pay rises, to reduce growth in total labour costs in the
face of uncertainty about growth prospects.  Few contactswere budgeting for a marked increase in pay settlements dueearly 2011 to reflect RPI.  Employees remained less likely tomove to other employers than pre-recession, and pay freezesand/or headcount reductions in the public sector weredampening private sector pay expectations.  The 2.2% increasein the National Minimum Wage in October was only expectedto create limited upward pressure on other employees’ pay. 
Non-labour costs
There was further evidence this month that growth in materialcost and imported finished goods inflation had eased slightly,although costs remained higher than a year earlier.  Concernremained about the near-term outlook for importedcomponent costs given pressures on capacity and productioncosts in Asia, and weather-related price shocks to commoditiessuch as wheat and cotton.  The recent appreciation of sterlinghad helped dampen cost increases a little for some, buthedging had delayed the benefit for others. The cost of imported finished goods also remained higher than
a year earlier but the pace of growth had slowed.  This wasmainly due to the effect of sterling appreciation offsettingsome underlying cost pressures.
Output prices
Manufacturing output prices were broadly unchanged over thepast three months, and slightly up on a year earlier.  Contactswere achieving a little more pass-through of cost inflationthan a year ago or were resisting decreases in their prices withgreater success, but there was a range of views on the futuredirection of prices.  Services prices remained slightly down onlast year, and flat over the past quarter.  Profitability in bothmanufacturing and services was ahead of last year due tovolume growth and tight cost control but margin growth hadfaltered a little.  Construction margins were under pressure inthe face of rising material costs and intense competition toreplenish thinning forward pipelines of work.
Consumer prices
Retail goods price inflation had eased slightly, but inflation hadpicked up for consumer services.  Underlying cost increases incommodities such as wheat and cotton had yet to feedthrough into higher retail goods prices but were of concern toretailers.  Reports of increases in new car prices had becomeless common than earlier in the year.  Within consumerservices, price inflation had picked up.  Insurance premiumswere up significantly, in both home and motor cover;  hotelsand restaurants were passing on some food cost increases;and airline travel and ancillary charges had risen. 
The 2011 VAT rise was likely to be passed on in full in early
January by a majority of contacts.  However, a sizable minoritywas planning to pass through the rise only by mid-February,and a smaller number were considering an earlier pass-throughduring 2010 Q4.  4

–Agents’ survey on cash holdings
According to official data, the aggregate financial surplus (1)of
UK corporates was relatively high going into the recession androse further during the recession.  An assessment of theprospects for corporate spending, eg on capital investment,stocks and debt repayment, depends in part on whether thecorporate surplus (and rise in saving) was planned orunplanned, and if planned what factors drove it.
To investigate this further, the Agents asked contacts about
the current level of their cash holdings
(2)relative to ‘normal’,
the changes to those holdings over the past year and thoseplanned for next year, and the reasons behind those changes.Around 440 businesses responded to the survey.  All figuresshown are weighted by turnover.
The survey results suggested that a significant majority of
firms had cash holdings above ‘normal’ ( Chart A ).  Larger
firms
(3)were much more likely to report cash balances well
above ‘normal’, while other firms tended to report averagebalances only a little above normal.  
The results also suggested that the majority of firms had
increased their cash holdings over the past year ( Chart B ), in
many cases significantly, consistent with the picture shown bythe official financial balance data.  
Firms in all sectors reported that holdings had risen over the
past year, with manufacturing contacts reporting the largestrise.  
Higher profits were the most frequently cited reason by
contacts to explain the rise in cash holdings over the past year.Firms had also chosen to build up larger ‘buffers’ of cash toprotect themselves against uncertainty, for example in
demand conditions and credit availability.
The results also suggested that a small net balance of firms
were planning to reduce their cash holdings over the next year(Chart B ), despite expecting on average a positive contribution
from profits.  A significant minority reported plans to increaseholdings.  
A small net balance of larger firms were expecting to reduce
their cash balances a little over the next year, whereas onaverage smaller firms were expecting to maintain holdingsaround current levels.
Firms operating in the manufacturing sector were expecting to
maintain their higher balances over the next year:  firms inother sectors were expecting to reduce their balances.
Some contacts reported that the small reduction in cash
holdings planned over the next year reflected theirexpectations for a modest increase in investment financedfrom cash.  That was consistent with Agents’ reports of apickup in planned investment, in particular by manufacturers.Other contacts cited debt repayment as a factor likely toreduce cash holdings;  and it was possible that M&A activitymight increase.Chart A How would you describe your current cash
