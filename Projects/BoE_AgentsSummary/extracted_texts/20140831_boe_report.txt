 Retail sales and consumer services values had continued to grow at a steady rate.
The number of housing market transactions had eased over recent months.  Market participants attributed that to
shortages in housing stock and the effects of the implementation of the Mortgage Market Review.
Contacts’ capital expenditure plans suggested continued steady growth in investment over the next
twelve months.
 Business services turnover growth had remained robust.
 Manufacturing output for the domestic market had continued to grow steadily.  Growth of manufacturing export
values had eased slightly, reflecting weaker global demand growth.
 Construction output growth had remained strong.
 Corporate credit conditions had improved slightly further.
 Employment intentions had continued to grow more slowly than output for most contacts, as they strived to
improve productivity.
 Recruitment difficulties had edged up further, remaining modestly above normal.
 Capacity utilisation had been unchanged, remaining marginally above normal.
Growth in total labour costs per employee had remained moderate.
 Materials costs and imported finished goods prices had fallen on a year earlier, partly reflecting the effects of
sterling’s appreciation.
 Output price inflation was stable in business services, but had eased back in manufacturing, partly reflecting easing
input costs.  Profitability had risen further, although the rate of growth had slowed slightly for services.
 Consumer price inflation had remained modest reflecting the persistent price-sensitivity of consumers, the slow
recovery in real incomes and, consequently, intense retailer competition.

August 2014Demand
Consumption
Annual growth in retail sales values and consumer services
values had continued to grow at a steady rate ( Chart 1 ).
Within retail sales, contacts reported a patchy recovery acrossspending categories.  In food, there appeared to be anincreasing polarisation in the market towards the value andpremium ends of the spectrum, but overall sales were thoughtto be relatively flat.  The picture for non-food sales wasgenerally more positive, with a gradual strengthening indurable items such as furniture, bathrooms, kitchens and homefurnishings, due to pent-up demand continuing to unwind andthe earlier recovery in the housing market.  Fashion sales hadreceived a boost from better summer weather than in recentyears.  But growth in new car sales had eased back from itspeak earlier in the year.  Consumer services growth remainedfractionally ahead of retail sales, reflecting the relative strengthof spending on leisure activities, such as pubs, restaurants andhotel accommodation.  Some tourist attractions and coastaltowns were reporting their strongest season in years, whileairport passenger numbers were higher than a year ago.
Housing market
Housing market transactions had eased over recent months.Supply shortages were cited as the most common explanationfor that slowing.  The implementation of the Mortgage MarketReview was also commonly cited as a factor, for the most partby lengthening the mortgage application process.  There weresigns of an easing of house price inflation, concentrated in theSouth, where some prices were lower than earlier in the yearand there were fewer cases of sealed bids and offers overasking prices.  The Help to Buy Equity Loan scheme remainedpopular among first-time buyers;  especially for purchases ofnew-build properties.
Business investment
Investment intentions had continued to point to steadygrowth over the next twelve months, remaining stronger inservices than in manufacturing.  Within the services sector,
spending on IT improvements, hotel refurbishmentprogrammes, investment by hauliers in new fleet and upgradesof car dealerships were commonplace as firms responded to animproving trading environment.  Retailers had shiftedinvestment towards online activities and the associated newwarehousing and distribution capacity, along with furthergrowth in convenience stores.  In manufacturing the picturewas more mixed with many firms focused on realising thebenefits of earlier investment, while others — particularly inthe food and drink sector — were spending to replaceworn-out kit or improve productivity, rather than to growcapacity substantially.  Investment in the UK oil and gas sectorwas reported to have peaked in 2013 and exploration activitywas now low.
Exports
Manufacturing export volumes growth had eased a little(Chart 2 ), reflecting some softening of demand, especially in
the emerging economies.  More concerns were voiced thismonth by goods exporters about the impact of a furtherappreciation of sterling.  However, at the current exchange rateexporters remained broadly positive and did not expect recentsoftening in demand to persist.  Demand for exports hadstabilised in Europe and the outlook there was now reported tobe positive.  Strong growth was expected from theUnited States over the next twelve months.  But concernsabout the wider effects of political tensions in Ukraine, andabout developments in parts of the Middle East had increased.Services exports had continued to rise.  Inbound tourism was adriver of growth with both US and Asian visitor numbersparticularly strong, especially outside London.  Spending bybusiness travellers had also continued to rise.  Digital andmedia exports had seen significant growth, which was expectedto continue.  Professional firms, particularly in the legal andarchitectural sectors, had reported a rise in exports, and theMiddle East had maintained its appetite for engineeringconsultancy expertise from the United Kingdom.  A box onpage 4 presents the results of an Agents’ survey on exports.2

Output
Business services
Business services turnover had continued to grow robustly.
Initial public offering, private equity and merger andacquisitions activity were all buoyant, supporting increaseddemand for legal, accountancy, consultancy and other relatedservices.  The commercial real estate sector had continued tostrengthen, with equity investors from the United Kingdomand overseas moving beyond London in a search for higheryields.  Employment agencies, architects and civil engineeringservices also reported strengthening demand.  Banks hadbenefited from increased activity in equity markets, but fallingcomplexity in some financial markets had negatively affecteddemand for some investment banking services.  Other businessservices turnover growth had remained strong, especially in IT,warehousing and distribution services.  Demand for businessaccommodation and conferencing had continued to recover.
Manufacturing
Manufacturing output for the domestic market had continuedto show steady growth ( Chart 2 ), with the construction supply
chain still reporting the strongest upturn in growth.  Outputgrowth across the transport sector remained strong, partlyreflecting some new product launches in the automotivesector.  This, together with continuing strength in the civilaerospace sector, was benefiting the engineering supply chainand other subsectors, such as electronics, plastics, metals andtechnical textiles.  The pickup in consumer confidence andearlier rise in housing market activity had fed through to risingdemand for home improvement and garden products.  Foodand drinks manufacturers reported higher sales due to recentwarm weather and major sporting events.
Construction
Growth in construction output had remained strong.  Therewere some reports that the pace of growth was being limitedby shortages of materials and labour.  That was said to havedelayed some house building and infrastructure projects,although the extent of difficulties varied between regions andfirms.  The slowdown in housing market activity had notaffected the appetite for output growth among the majorhouse builders, and contacts reported that a shortage ofGrade-A commercial property could lead to a ramp-up inactivity in the next 6–18 months in some regional city centres.Infrastructure spending had continued to rise, notably on railand highways.
Credit conditions
Competition between the banks had intensified, particularlyfor low-risk business, which was putting some pressure onlenders’ margins and leading to an easing of covenants in somecases.  There were suggestions that in some cases ‘pre-crisis’lending terms were being offered to those companies with thestrongest balance sheets.  For other types of borrowers, banks’
risk-appetite was reported to be less changed.  Firms with littlecollateral, or that were not yet cash-generative, continued tostruggle to obtain credit or regarded the terms offered as toocostly or onerous.  Appetite for borrowing, especially forworking capital, had increased as business confidence levelsimproved.  More firms were exploring alternatives to bankborrowing or using improved conditions as an opportunity torepay bank debt.  Refinancing, often for increased facilities, wascommon, with borrowers seeking to take advantage of thecompetitive market and low interest rates.
Employment
Employment intentions had been unchanged, pointing tomodest headcount growth across all sectors.  The main driverwas improving activity levels, but the recruitment ofapprentices and graduates to address skill shortages and theprospective retirement of older staff was gaining momentum,while additional regulatory responsibilities were an importantfactor for financial services firms. Intentions continued to growmore slowly than output for most contacts, as they strived toimprove productivity.  Intentions were strongest in services,where workforce growth was gradually becoming morebroad-based across subsectors, including IT, real estate,professional services and leisure.  Manufacturing employmentgrowth was being tempered by a preference among somecontacts to use overtime and/or agency workers to cope withpeaks and troughs.  Recruitment difficulties had picked upfurther ( Chart 3 ) and were gradually spreading beyond the
regularly cited shortages within IT, engineering andconstruction, to other sectors.  These included qualifiedprofessional services staff with 3–5 years’ experience,HGV drivers and senior management posts.  Lower-skilledstaff were still relatively easily available, with migrant workersfilling many gaps.  While employee retention remained higherthan pre-recession norms for many contacts, labour mobilityhad edged up, prompting some to take pre-emptive action onpay and benefits.

–In the past three months, ‘relative to normal’Chart 3 Recruitment difficultiesAgents’ survey on exports
Sterling’s trade-weighted exchange rate has risen by over 10%
since its trough in March 2013.  Against that background, theAgents conducted a survey in June and July to ask contactshow the sterling value of UK exports had changed over thepast three months on a year earlier, their expectations for thenext year and the factors likely to affect the sterling value ofexports.  Contacts were also asked about the impact ofsterling’s appreciation in particular on sterling export values,volumes and margins.
Some 330 companies participated, including nearly
80 services firms, with export destinations that were broadlyrepresentative of UK trade patterns, based on companies’principal reported export market.  The results were weightedby companies’ export values.
A net balance of respondent firms reported a modest increase
in sterling export values over the past year, but expectations ofgrowth were more positive for the next twelve months(Chart A ).
Growth in export values to the euro area was reported to have
been positive, as was that to the United States, albeit to alesser degree.  However, net balances for firms whose principalmarkets were in Asia or other markets were negative.  A similargeographical split was seen for expectations of growth ofexport values:  expectations were strongly positive for thosewhose principal market was the United States and theeuro area, but negative for Asia and other markets.  By sector,there was marked strength in the expectations of goodsexporters, especially those whose principal market was theeuro area, while services firms expected more modest growth.
Looking at the factors affecting exports over the next
twelve months, overseas demand, market share, entry to newmarkets and quality of product were expected to be positive
influences on growth ( Chart B ).  The exchange rate was
expected to have a negative effect, in marked contrast tofindings of the previous Agents’ exports survey of April 2013before the bulk of the appreciation, and more so for goodsthan services exports.
Contacts were also asked about the impact on export
performance of:  sterling’s appreciation in the pasttwelve months, sterling remaining at current levels for a yearand sterling appreciating by a further 10% over the next year.For the past year, the majority of goods exporters reported anadverse impact on sterling values and a squeeze on margins,with limited impact on volumes ( Chart C ).  For services, most
reported no effect.  That pattern was expected to remain thecase if sterling remained at current levels over the next year.However, in a scenario where sterling appreciated by a further10% over the next twelve months, a markedly higher numberof respondents expected an adverse impact on goods exportvolumes.  The potential adverse impact on services exportvolumes of that scenario was seen to be less pronounced,with a sizable number of services exporters reporting noexpected effect.

Capacity utilisation
Firms’ capacity utilisation had been unchanged, remaining
marginally above normal.  In manufacturing, the utilisation ofstaff was often higher than that of physical capacity and,subject to acquiring additional skilled labour, contacts oftensaid that they could readily scale up output from existingphysical capacity.  Some contacts in automotive, oil and gas,and construction-related production had reported an increasein capital utilisation, such as bringing mothballed brickmanufacturing capacity back into use.  There was lessdivergence between physical capital and labour utilisation inthe services sector.  In professional services, to the extentthere were constraints binding, those were usually shortagesof skilled staff.  But in some sectors, such as retail, parts ofthe capital stock had become obsolete or inefficient givenstructural shifts in the economy.  Firms in sometechnology-focused sectors such as IT and online retailingsaw that their output could be readily scaled up from existingcapacity.
Costs and prices
Labour costs
Pay settlements had edged higher, providing some signs thatwage pressures were starting to increase.  The majority ofsettlements remained in the 2%–3% range, but in contrast toa year ago, pay freezes were rare and an increasing number ofcontacts were reporting settlements above 3%, particularly insectors where skills shortages were most acute such asconstruction, IT, HGV drivers, oil and gas and engineering.Professional services firms were also modestly increasing paysettlements as staff churn increased, although the pattern ofreplacing experienced leavers with more junior recruits wasrestraining total labour cost growth.  Low rates of opting-outfrom auto-enrolment pension schemes were reported, whichwas pushing up on total labour costs.
Non-labour costs
Materials cost inflation had remained negative, in partreflecting the impact of the appreciation of sterling, and themajority of contacts expected the relatively benign costenvironment to continue ( Chart 4 ).  Construction materials
had been an exception to that pattern, with reports ofdouble-digit cost increases not uncommon.  The cost ofimported finished goods had been drifting down more slowlythan for materials imports, reflecting the propensity ofretailers to buy several seasons ahead and to enterlonger-term hedging arrangements.  Some cost increases hadbeen apparent in the service sector from regulatorycompliance, waste disposal, utilities and other overheads,including business rates and rents.Output prices and margins
The rate of inflation in manufacturing output prices had eased.For most manufacturers it had remained difficult to raiseprices when inflationary pressures from materials and labourwere benign and competition heightened, including fromimports due to the appreciation of sterling.  The mainsupermarkets had continued to resist any pass through of costincreases by food manufacturers.  But prices of buildingmaterials, such as bricks, had continued to rise briskly as aresult of supply shortages.  Business services output priceinflation had remained stable.  Some companies, including inthe transport, IT consultancy and recruitment sectors,reported that it was becoming slightly easier to implementmodest fee increases as clients’ own activity levels had pickedup.  However, across the bulk of the business services sectorthere was sufficient capacity to meet current levels of demandand, therefore, limited ability to increase prices.  Pressure oncommercial property rents had remained muted outside ofprime locations.
Modest growth in manufacturing profitability had continued.
Improved volumes, a subdued cost environment and greaterefficiency had allowed most manufacturers to grow theirmargins slightly, despite an inability to increase pricing.  Therehad been a slight easing in service sector profitability growth,although it had remained positive.  Service companies wererelying on cost-cutting, increased productivity or, in somecases, a move to higher margin business as activity increasedto generate profitability.  Some exporters reported thatsterling’s appreciation had squeezed their margins.  Althoughmany had been partially cushioned from exchange ratemovements as a result of hedging, there were concerns aboutthe impact of a further appreciation of sterling.
Consumer prices
Consumer price inflation had remained modest, with retailersciting high price sensitivity of demand and the slow recovery ofconsumers’ real incomes as reasons for price restraint.  Intensecompetition among retailers, especially in food, and the priceMaterials costs

transparency afforded by internet retailing also continued to
exert downward pressure on inflation.  Meanwhile, inflation infootwear and clothing prices had picked up due to tighterstock control and warm weather that had enabled sales to belater, and discounting shallower, than a year before.  Gradualprice increases had also been apparent for some non-regulatedtransport, leisure and personal services due to strongerdemand.
