April 2012Demand
Consumption
Consumer demand growth remained modest, although there
were some reports of an improvement in trading conditionsover the past few months.  Spending on goods had beensupported by a slight rise in demand for big-ticket items.  Salesof furniture and white goods had also picked up a little,perhaps related to a rise in activity in the housing market.Demand for food and clothing remained heavily dependent on discounting, however, with online retail continuing to gain market share from the high street.  There had also been a modest tickup in activity in consumer services, partlydue to increasingly widespread promotional activity.  Somecontacts also reported that consumers had become morewilling to pay for one-off events, although spending on some regular activities such as visits to the gym, had beensqueezed.
Housing market
There had been a rise in the number of viewings, offers andtransactions in recent months, although demand remainedsignificantly below its pre-recession level and a few Agenciesdetected little sign of recovery.  Contacts suggested a numberof reasons for the improvement in conditions.  TheGovernment’s FirstBuy scheme and construction companies’own initiatives had bolstered demand for newly built property.Growth in buy-to-let demand, partly in response to pastincreases in rental yields, had also helped to put a floor underprices.  And there was thought to have been a rise inconfidence among prospective buyers, some of whom hadbeen holding back in case of a further weakening in thehousing market.  Part of the recent increase in activity was alsolikely to have been demand which had been brought forward,ahead of the end of stamp duty relief.  Some contacts alsosuggested that vendors were becoming a little more realisticabout asking prices.
Business investment
Investment intentions pointed to a gradual rise in expenditureon capital over the coming year, and plans had strengthened alittle in recent months ( Chart 1 ).  That reflected a slight
improvement in sentiment, as contacts’ worst fears concerningthe euro area had not materialised.  And some firms haddecided to press on with investments despite continueduncertainty about the outlook.  Across sectors, spending planswere typically underpinned by replacement and maintenance,efficiency gains, or for compliance purposes.  Amongmanufacturers, there had also been a slight pickup in reports ofinvestment in additional capacity, usually from those in theexport sector.  And there were a few reports of plans to bringparts of the production process back to the United Kingdom,instead of buying components from abroad.  Contacts inservices tended to have more modest investment intentions,as demand was often still weak.Exports and imports
Export growth remained robust, and the Agents’ score forexports of goods had edged up a little on the month ( Chart 2 ).
That reflected both rising world demand, and an increase inthe market share of UK suppliers in foreign markets.  Therewere continued reports of strong demand growth in theautomotive, aerospace, energy and IT sectors.  Activity wasparticularly buoyant in emerging market economies, whichwere importing investment goods and, increasingly, luxuryconsumer products.  But demand was very weak in Europeancountries at the centre of concerns over government debt.
Many manufacturing contacts continued to try to lower
production costs by off-shoring, particularly for low-value,high-volume components.  But there were further reports fromfirms which had brought part of a previously outsourcedproduction process back to the United Kingdom, in response torising costs abroad, or to concerns about quality and reliabilityof supply.

seen some rise in corporate transactions, in part, as concerns
about risks stemming from the euro area had recededsomewhat.  There had been a pickup in corporate litigation andwork on restructuring and recovery.  Logistics companies hadbenefited from rising trade and increased spending online byhouseholds.  And some IT firms were growing quite quickly,buoyed by the mix of corporate investment.
Manufacturing
Contacts reported a modest increase in manufacturing outputfor the domestic market ( Chart 2 ).  In large part, rising activity
reflected increased output by firms in export supply chains,particularly among producers of intermediate and investmentgoods for other businesses in the aerospace, automotive andenergy sectors.  Repatriation, or ‘localisation’, of productionwas also providing some support to activity, and some firmswere gaining domestic market share at the expense of foreigncompetition.  But suppliers which served the domesticgovernment or household sectors tended to report thatconditions were difficult.  For instance, firms in the defenceindustry, and producers of consumer goods, often reported flator falling demand.  Suppliers to the construction sector werealso often facing a challenging environment.  Food productionwas rising gradually, although volume growth was oftensecured only by participating in retailers’ promotions.
Construction
Output in the construction sector was lower compared with ayear earlier but there had been little sign of a significantlylarger fall in activity than usual over the winter period.  Thegradual pace of contraction reflected a steady decline in publicsector contracts, combined with subdued private sectoractivity.  There had been some improvement in private housingconstruction, however, encouraged by rising demand for newlybuilt homes.  Although, contacts reported that the planningprocess remained a constraint on some projects.  Work oninfrastructure was also supporting the level of output, alongwith some commercial property development in London.  Buta slowing in the pace of expansion of some large nationalretailers was beginning to weigh on growth.  Looking ahead,some firms involved in the early stages of the constructionprocess, such as architects and engineers, reported a rise inpreparatory work, though this would not feed through toconstruction output for some time.
Credit conditions
Contacts reported that there had been some tightening incredit conditions in recent months.  Existing facilities had oftenbeen made more costly on renewal, arrangement fees hadrisen, and collateral requirements on new lending had becomemore stringent.  But few contacts had observed a reduction inthe quantity of credit available.  Exceptions to this tended tobe in the construction and retail sectors, where banks hadbecome more reluctant to lend.  (See the box on page 5 for adiscussion of the latest Agents’ survey on credit conditions.)
The focus of many businesses remained on deleveraging, whileothers sought to build up precautionary buffers againstunanticipated funding needs, or to finance investment withoutrecourse to the banks.  And some firms were also looking tonon-banks to secure finance — insurers and wealthyindividuals, for instance.
Small and medium-sized firms typically found it more difficult
than large ones to secure credit.  And they continued to beencouraged to use asset-backed forms of lending rather thanoverdrafts, which many were reluctant to do.  Smallerbusinesses also often reported that corporate liquidity wasbeing squeezed by larger business partners:  suppliers weretightening up on payment terms, while customers pushed toextend them.
Employment
Private sector hiring plans suggested that employment waslikely to be broadly flat over the next six months ( Chart 3 ).
Among manufacturers, there were further reports of anincrease in apprenticeship schemes, to address current, oranticipated shortages of key skills, particularly amongengineers.  But many firms had now caught up with pastincreases in activity, and felt able to meet demand growth withexisting labour in the near term.  In business services, therewas expected to be a slight decline in headcount overall, inlight of still subdued activity.  But companies in the IT sectorcontinued to take on staff.  And some large professional firmshad increased graduate recruitment in anticipation of futuregrowth.  A number of others reported that they were hangingon to existing employees, having found it difficult to rebuildstaffing levels after downsizing during past recessions.  Therewere expected to be further job losses in the banking sectorand retail, reflecting branch and store closures.
Capacity utilisation
In the manufacturing sector firms could typically meetexpected increases in demand with existing labour and capital.5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4

–Expected growth over the next six monthsChart 3 Employment intentionsAnd some slack had opened up recently, due to slowing output
growth, combined with past investment and recruitment.Some firms were stretched, however, particularly in the exportsector, or were facing constraints due to shortages of specialistengineering staff.  In the business services sector, meanwhile,there was usually rather more spare capacity, and contactsoften reported that there were too many firms chasing theavailable work.  That was particularly the case in areas where the service was of a standardised nature, leading tosignificant downward pressure on prices.  Capacity had alsoincreased a little in some of the larger firms, as a result ofrecruitment in anticipation of future growth.  But a fewspecialised businesses had very little slack, in IT andengineering advisory firms, for instance, where contactssometimes reported difficulties finding particular technicalskills.  Retailers could typically meet a substantial pickup indemand with existing staff and were sometimes closingunderperforming stores.
Costs and prices
Labour costs
Labour costs continued to rise at a moderate pace, withsettlements tending to be between 2% and 3%.  Above-average settlements were usually in growth industries,such as IT, or the export sector, due to both higher profitabilityand rising labour productivity, or to retain staff with nicheskills.  In contrast, pay freezes were still common in the mostsubdued areas — construction and retail, in particular.  Therewas typically little upward pressure on pay to compensate forpast inflation, although there were a few instances of a degreeof catch-up, usually in heavily unionised workforces, whereinflation-linking remained more prevalent than in otherbusinesses.  An element of performance-related pay wasbecoming increasingly widespread, although bonuses wereusually lower this year than last year.  Employers’ concernsabout the possibility of having to make increased contributionsto employees’ pensions were beginning to feed intoconsiderations for settlements in future rounds.
Non-labour costs
Non-labour costs continued to grow steadily, but the pace ofinflation had slowed in recent months, and was now around itshistorical average.  The prices of various raw materials, such ascotton and food, were beginning to level off, or decline.  Butsome prices, particularly for oil and oil-related products,energy, and some metals, had come under renewed upwardpressure.  And there was thought to be some upside risk tofood prices due to drought, particularly for domesticallyproduced crops.  Inflation in the price of imports of finishedgoods had been slowing in recent months, due to fallinginflation in the cost of raw materials.  But rising productioncosts in emerging market economies, particularly China, andrecent increases in transport costs, were offsetting this tosome extent.Output prices
Manufacturing output price inflation had begun to slow (Chart 4 ), reflecting declines in input cost inflation.  Where
margins had been eroded by past increases in costs, somefirms continued to attempt to pass those higher costs on, butdomestic demand conditions often prevented them from doingso.  In response, suppliers were often attempting toincorporate contractual clauses which would enable them topass on future increases in costs more readily.  At the sametime, suppliers to supermarkets remained under considerablepressure to pass on any recent reductions in costs, or toparticipate in pricing promotions.  Despite the weak demandenvironment, however, many firms had been able to preserve,or rebuild, margins through efficiency gains and risingproductivity.
Meanwhile, the prices charged by business services were
reported to be broadly flat on a year earlier ( Chart 4 ), against
a backdrop of intense competitive pressure in a number ofsectors, particularly for relatively standardised legal andaccountancy services.  And sizable increases in transportcharges due to higher fuel costs last year were beginning to fallout of the annual comparison of the price level.  But there hadbeen an increase in fees for some specialist services,particularly in growth areas, such as IT.
Consumer prices
Consumer goods price inflation remained elevated, but hadedged down a little on the month, after some fairly rapiddeclines.  The recent slowing in the pace of inflation was partlydue to the effect of the increase in VAT at the start of 2011,which was no longer contributing to annual growth in the pricelevel, along with a slight reduction in inflation in importedgoods prices.  Consumer services inflation had also slowed atouch.  The prices of some essential consumer servicescontinued to rise quite quickly, including for transportationand rent, in part due to links to official measures of inflation.But the weakness of demand for non-essential services hadlimited the extent to which contacts had been able to raiseprices, and promotional activity was becoming more common.4

–Three months on the same period a year earlierChart 4 Output price inflationAgents’ survey on credit conditions
Between February and March 2012 the Agents conducted a
survey to assess whether increases in the cost of bank fundingduring the second half of 2011 had fed through to corporatecredit conditions.  Businesses were asked about changes incredit conditions and their use of credit over the pastsix months, and the drivers of those changes.  469 businessesparticipated in the survey.  All of the charts in the followingdiscussion are weighted by turnover.
Nearly two thirds of firms reported that the cost and
availability of credit was unchanged ( Chart A ).  That may have
been because many firms have only infrequent interactionwith their lender.  As a result, it may take some time forchanges in credit conditions to be felt.  Nevertheless, asignificant positive net balance of those surveyed did reportthat the cost of finance had risen, suggesting that lenders hadpassed on some of the increase in the cost of funding.  Butthere was also a small positive net percentage balance of firms which had experienced an increase in the availability offinance.  The results were very similar for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), although the cost appearedto have risen by a touch more for SMEs than for large firms.
Across sectors, manufacturers had seen the least tightening in
the cost of credit, and reported an increase in overall creditavailability ( Chart B ).  In contrast, businesses in the
construction and consumer-facing sectors reported an increasein the cost of finance, along with reduced availability of credit.This probably reflects the less upbeat prospects for growth inthose sectors compared with manufacturing.  Availability wasbroadly unchanged for business services firms, although costswere reported to have risen a little.
In addition to the question about changes in credit conditions,
respondents were asked about changes in their demand forcredit, and their use of credit.  Perhaps surprisingly, despite
tighter conditions, a positive net balance of around 25% of construction firms reported an increase in their demand for credit.  But borrowing had actually declined, suggestingthat there was unmet demand in the sector.  Amongconsumer-facing companies there had been a reduction inboth the demand for credit and the use of external finance.Demand for credit and the amount of borrowing had risen inthe manufacturing and business services sectors.  Across thesample as a whole, increased use of finance was largelyconfined to large firms.
Finally, contacts were asked whether, and how, recent changes
in credit conditions had affected their behaviour.  In aggregatethere was little reported impact on behaviour, consistent withthe relatively modest reported changes in credit conditions.But, looking at just those firms which had experienced atightening in credit conditions, there was a tendency for themto have reduced their holdings of cash ( Chart C ).  In contrast,
other firms had tended to have raised their cash balances —perhaps as a precautionary buffer, or to finance futureinvestment.  A very similar pattern of responses was apparentfor both investment and employment plans.
