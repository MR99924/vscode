December 2011Demand
Consumption
The nominal value of consumer spending continued to grow
slowly, but volumes were lower compared with a year earlier.Discounts remained essential to drive sales growth, andhouseholds continued to trade down in quality and do more oftheir shopping online in the hope of finding bargains.  Mildweather had hurt sales of autumn and winter clothing andspending on big ticket items was still very weak.  Somecontacts thought that the full week’s trading period beforeChristmas would lead more people than usual to leave giftbuying till the last minute, in the hope of finding a bargain.But many retailers had trimmed stock levels compared withlast year, to avoid having to discount heavily to clear surplusinventory.
Spending on consumer services was also rising gradually,
compared with a year earlier.  That was largely due to higherexpenditure on essential consumer services, which had beendriven upwards by price increases.  Rising rent for housing hadincreased expenditure on accommodation, while spending ontransportation had been pushed up by higher fares.  That hadsqueezed the available income left over for discretionaryservices, leading to a switching in the pattern of demand.  Forinstance, contacts in leisure and tourism reported that footfalltended to be heavier during cheaper, off-peak, periods.Secondary spending at visitor attractions had become weaker.And fewer people were now taking second holidays than in thepast.  Households were also taking out lower levels ofinsurance, choosing to bear a greater proportion of riskthemselves.
Housing market
Estate agents reported a further softening in much of thehousing market.  First-time buyers remained constrained bythe need for a sizable deposit to secure a mortgage, althoughthey had received some support from shared equity schemes.Meanwhile, existing homeowners were increasingly reluctantto trade up, for fear of falling house prices and concerns aboutrefinancing at higher interest rates, contributing to a reductionin the stock of properties for sale.  Activity at the higher end ofthe market was a bit more buoyant, as buyers were typicallyless financially constrained.  Any available prime sites weretypically used to build homes targeted at this section of themarket.  Buy-to-let investors continued to provide a source ofdemand for smaller properties favoured by would-behomeowners unable to buy.
Business investment
There had been a further decline in the Agents’ scores forinvestment intentions, pointing to slowing in the growth rateof spending on capital over the next twelve months ( Chart 1 ).
For some firms, the general improvement in activity expectedearlier in the year had not materialised, and that had reducedthe need for further capital spending.  For others, renewed
pressure on working capital had led them to switch their focusback to cash preservation.  But investment plans remainedstrong among exporters, although there was rising caution dueto uncertainties surrounding the euro area.  And spendingcontinued to be supported by the resumption of replacementcycles and the need for additional IT for compliance purposes.Firms were also still investing in projects yielding rapid costreductions, such as improved waste management and energyefficiency, and labour-saving technology, as well as in projectswhich offered the possibility of rapid growth, particularly thosetargeting the online market.
Exports
There had been some slowing in the growth rate of goodsexports over recent months, reflecting softening worlddemand growth, particularly in the euro area.  Demandcontinued to grow quickly in many emerging markets.  Andsome firms were trying to shift their focus towards such rapidlyexpanding economies.  Producers of many luxury consumergoods were seeing rapid growth due to rising householdspending in some developing countries, although the globalmarket for consumer electronics was particularly weak.Exporters in the mining, transport and energy industries werebenefiting from efforts to build up infrastructure in a numberof emerging economies.  In turn, the need of those exportersfor supporting service functions was encouraging someprofessional and financial services firms to expand into thesegrowth areas as well.
Output

Work related to mergersand acquisitions had fallen as transactions had beendiscouraged by rising uncertainty and difficulties raisingfinance.  Spending on corporate travel and hospitality had2

fallen back as rising caution had begun to weigh on
non-essential outlays.  Contacts in construction-relatedservices, such as surveyors and architects, reported aslowdown in the sector.  Recruitment companies had also seena fall in activity, as employment intentions softened.  Butproviders of IT services continued to report rapid growth.Regulation and compliance-related activity, along with apickup in insolvency and recovery work, was supporting somelegal and accountancy firms.
Manufacturing
Manufacturing output for the domestic market continued togrow at a modest pace, but the growth rate had slowed sincethe summer.  Growth was often driven by suppliers in theexport supply chain, for instance in the automotive andaerospace industries, as well as those in the energy sector.Producers of consumer durables for the home market typicallyreported that activity was declining, although food productionwas still showing some resilience.  Firms supplying theconstruction industry and the public sector had also seen adecline in output.  So far, most contacts reported that therehad been little disruption as a result of the flooding inThailand, although a small number were concerned that therecould be acute shortages of specific electronic components tocome.  That had contributed to concerns about the security ofsupply chains which had come to the fore after the earthquakeand tsunami in Japan.
Construction
The level of activity in the construction sector had declinedslightly compared with a year earlier.  Some firms reportedthat large public sector contracts had come to an end, whileprivate sector projects were sometimes stalled because ofplanning uncertainty and funding difficulties.  The level ofactivity continued to be supported by some largeinfrastructure projects, in transport, energy and utilities, andcommercial developments in London, although work on theOlympics was now declining.  There was some residentialconstruction underway, but house builders were keen not tooutpace growth in demand.  Looking ahead, public sector workwas expected to fall further, and indicators of future privateactivity also pointed to a slowing in activity.  The comingreduction of incentives for the fitting of solar panels wasexpected to push down on this source of work as well.
Credit conditions
A few firms thought that conditions had tightened recently,although such reports were not widespread.  Credit conditionsremained tight for many small businesses.  Larger firms andthose with strong financial accounts typically reported thatcredit was available if required, although conditions were notas loose as immediately prior to the recession.  The demand forloans was generally low, however, and contacts themselvesoften confirmed that they remained focused on paying offoutstanding debt, or would prefer to finance investment from
internal sources of finance, rather than use the banks.  Thatreflected continuing concerns about unexpected changes toexisting borrowing arrangements on their renewal.  Along withgrowing pressure on working capital due to rising input costsand extended payment times, that had led some businesses toreturn their focus to the preservation of cash flow, rather thanborrowing for the future.
Employment
Private sector employment intentions had been steadilyweakening and now suggested that employment would remainbroadly flat over the coming year ( Chart 2 ).  Disappointing
growth and rising uncertainty about the outlook had led to afairly sharp weakening in the recruitment plans of manybusiness services contacts, particularly among professionaland financial services exposed to property and construction.That was offset by continued recruitment of key individualswith skills in IT, sales, and regulatory compliance.  Meanwhile,consumer-facing firms expected headcount to decline slightlyover the coming year, as demand continued to soften.  Manycontacts in manufacturing still planned to increaseemployment, particularly among exporters and those in foodproduction.  But for some manufacturers of engineeredproducts, recruitment difficulties were becoming a constrainton growth.  And firms were increasingly taking on apprenticesto address shortages of staff with the requisite technical skills.Producers of durable goods for domestic households, andthose exposed to construction and the public sector weretypically not planning to recruit, reflecting weak demand andrising uncertainty.
Capacity utilisation
Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector had easedback slightly in recent months, reflecting slightly slowerdemand growth combined with improved supply potential dueto past recruitment and investment.  Overall, levels of spare5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4

–Growth over the next six monthsChart 2 Employment intentionscapacity were reported to be around normal, although there
was variation between sectors.  Exporters were typicallyworking closest to full capacity, while those facing domesticconsumers often had significant scope to expand output.Relatively weaker demand conditions in the service sectormeant that firms usually exhibited rather more spare capacitythan in manufacturing.  But, again, the distribution of thatslack was uneven.  In standardised professional and financialservices, there was still considerable over capacity across thesector as a whole, whereas suppliers of specialist services, forinstance in IT, were often flat out.
Costs and prices
Labour costs
Labour costs continued to grow at a moderate pace.Settlements were usually between 2%–3% in bothmanufacturing and services, although there were some higherawards in areas where profitability and labour productivity hadbeen growing strongly, for instance in the export sector andamong providers of IT services.  The need to retain individualswith particular skills had also pushed up on settlements forsome.  By contrast, in consumer services and construction,awards tended to be rather weaker, and were often related toincreases in the national minimum wage.  Overall, there waslittle upward pressure on pay growth, due to the weakness ofactivity.  And contacts expected that situation to persist intonext year, with a similar rate of increase in settlements likely in2012.  Total labour costs were growing slightly more quicklythan regular pay, due to bonuses paid for rising profitabilitylast year.  But this was expected to reverse next year, in light ofdisappointing performance more recently.  Rising pensioncontributions had also pushed up on total labour costs.
Non-labour costs
Inflation in raw materials continued to slow, with a range ofcommodities prices beginning to level off, or decline — as withsome metals and agricultural commodities prices, for instance.And a few firms had been able to negotiate away some of thepast increases in the price of raw materials, as world demandgrowth had slowed.  But there continued to be upwardpressure from higher energy prices as fixed-term contractsended.  That was, in turn, feeding through to the prices ofenergy intensive products.  Import price inflation remainedelevated, reflecting past increases in raw materials prices, aswell as rising production costs in some emerging economies.Flooding in Thailand had also resulted in a fall in supply ofsome electrical components, such as hard drives, causing theirprices to rise quite sharply.  Partially offsetting that, there hadbeen a significant fall in shipping costs, reflecting slowingworld activity and increased capacity.
Output prices
Manufacturing output price inflation was still fairly high, asfirms passed on some of the past increases in the cost ofnon-labour inputs ( Chart 3 ).  But firms typically expected
not to be able to pass on those costs completely, given theweakness of domestic demand, and continued to try toeliminate any unnecessary costs, to restore lost margin.Contacts expected output price inflation to fall over thecoming year, due to slowing non-labour cost inflation.  Inbusiness services there had been renewed downward pressureon fees for standardised professional and financial services,reflecting fierce competition in the sector ( Chart 3 ).
Nevertheless, some niche services continued to be able toraise prices, while higher charges for fuel had pushed up onthe price of travel and distribution compared with a yearearlier.
Consumer prices
Annual retail goods inflation remained elevated.  Somecontacts suggested that food price inflation would fall backnext year, however, as supermarkets were likely to pushsuppliers to pass on recent reductions in the cost of someagricultural commodities.  Unseasonably mild weather had ledto some early discounting of unsold stock of autumn andwinter clothing lines.  Reflecting the weakness of demand, awider range of retailers than usual was reported to be makinguse of promotional devices.  But there were still some pocketsof upward pressure on prices.  For instance, jewellery priceswere rising quickly, due to increases in the cost of preciousmetals.
Retail price inflation in the service sector was also still high,
due to increases in the prices of essentials, such as transportand rent.  By contrast, prices for discretionary services, forinstance in the leisure and tourism sectors, were underdownward pressure.  And services firms were increasinglyadopting promotion models used in goods retail, with bundledor heavily discounted offers becoming more common,particularly in the restaurant and hotel industries.  The price ofcar servicing was falling as dealerships had been forced tocompete with independent garages.  Estate agents reportedcontinued downward pressure on fees.4
