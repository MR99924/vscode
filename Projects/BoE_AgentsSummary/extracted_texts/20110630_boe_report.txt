June 2011Demand
Consumption
The growth rate of nominal spending on retail goods remained
sluggish ( Chart 1 ).  There had been a modest boost to sales
due to fine weather and the incidence of bank holidays,reflected in increased spending on clothing and footwear, foodand drink and outdoor goods.  But some of this representedspending that had been brought forward, and contacts thoughtit unlikely to persist.  Rather, the underlying driver of slowgrowth in consumption — weak growth in real personaldisposable income — was expected to remain the dominantfactor in households’ spending decisions.  This continued to beevident in falling sales of big ticket items, retailers’ reliance onpromotions to drive volumes, and the rising market shares ofdiscount brands.
Similar forces were at work in consumer services, where
turnover growth continued to be weak.  The leisure industryhad benefited from the warm weather, but heavy discountingwas required to stimulate spending on a range of discretionaryservices.  Shifts in market share towards less expensiveconsumer services were also apparent, for instance in increasedspending on camping holidays.  Demand for public transporthad risen, as consumers sought to make less use of their cars.Spending on essential services, such as housing rent andinsurance, continued to grow, in large part due to rising prices.
Housing market
The level of activity in much of the housing market remainedvery subdued, although there had been an improvement at thetop end of the market, especially in London.  Many first-timebuyers were still finding it difficult to raise a sufficiently largedeposit to be eligible for a mortgage.  And concerns aboutfuture incomes and possible declines in house prices continuedto weigh on the market in general, both on demand, and onsupply, deterring many prospective sellers that mightotherwise have considered trading up.  Some homeownerswere also reluctant to move if unable to carry over their
mortgage to a new property.  Some contacts worried that anincrease in Bank Rate might simultaneously reduce demand,and cause a rise in forced sales, as the finances of somehouseholds became over-stretched.  And those forces mightprecipitate a further downwards adjustment in prices.  Abuoyant rental market was attracting buy-to-let investorstowards the type of smaller properties favoured by frustratedwould-be homeowners.
Business investment
Manufacturing investment intentions continued to point tosteady growth in capital spending in the sector ( Chart 2 ).
Investment plans were strongest among exporters, whichoften reported that they were spending to expand capacity.Among firms supplying the domestic market, spending tendedto be on repair and maintenance, or replacement.  Attentionhad become more focused on improving waste management,reflecting rapid inflation in the prices of various raw materialsand the cost of disposal.  And there was also greater emphasison energy efficiency and use of renewables in response torising energy prices.  But some of this latter investment was onhold due to uncertainty about government policy.
The Agents’ score for investment intentions in the service
sector suggested that growth in capital expenditure wouldcontinue at a modest pace ( Chart 2 ).  Spending was motivated
largely by firms’ efforts to find efficiencies and cut labour costs.There had been some investment in additional capacity inports and shipping, and in distribution and logistics, reflectingthe recovery in world trade.  Among consumer-facing firms,intentions in the main were fairly weak, although some largesupermarkets, discount retailers and budget hotels continuedto expand in an attempt to gain market share.  And many firmswere investing in IT to target the on-line market.
Exports and imports
Manufacturing exports continued to grow quickly, due to risingworld demand and the past depreciation of sterling.  There had2

been a shift in the focus of many businesses towards meeting
foreign demand, and there were further reports from contactsthat had successfully won market share in both existing andnew markets abroad.  Export growth had been strongest toemerging markets, and parts of Europe, especially Germany,and some contacts reported rising demand from theUnited States.  The aerospace and pharmaceutical sectorswere sources of particular strength.  Exports of vehicles hadslowed somewhat, which was thought to have been largelydue to reduced output of the sector following the earthquakein Japan.
There continued to be relatively few reports of firms switching
away from foreign suppliers of components towards domesticones, despite the rises in import costs over recent years, inlarge part because of a lack of domestic supply.  This wouldtake some time to develop, and even at the current exchangerate, domestic production in some industries might not becompetitive.  But there was a trickle of reports of productionthat had previously been off-shored being brought backin-house, very tentatively suggesting that domestic supply wasresponding in some industries.  And established UK suppliers ofgoods to the domestic market often did recognise that marketshare had improved at the expense of foreign competitors.
Output
Business services
While private sector activity had been growing, a slowing inpublic sector work was being felt very widely.  The Agents’score for turnover in professional and financial services pointedto a gradual recovery, particularly in legal and accountancywork, IT and recruitment.  Turnover growth in other businessservices remained muted.  There had been a slightimprovement in conditions for providers of corporate facilities,travel and marketing, albeit at very competitive prices.Hauliers and wholesale distributors of consumer durablesnoted a slowing in activity, although there had been anincrease in export business.  And contacts in ports andshipping confirmed that shipments for export were growingsteadily, while there had been a slowing in inbound ones.Across the service sector, there were reports of delays todecision-making and hold-ups in processes due to theincidence of bank holidays.
Manufacturing
The Agents’ score for manufacturing output pointed to solidgrowth, with the strongest reports from suppliers ofcomponents to exporters.  Manufacturers of capital goodswere benefiting from domestic firms’ investment spending.Producers of goods for the domestic consumer reported mixedfortunes.  Suppliers of big ticket items were facing achallenging environment, as households reined in spending ondurables.  By contrast, some food and drink producers, andclothing manufacturers, reported a small pickup in output.
Output in the automotive sector was significantly belownormal following the earthquake in Japan and the consequentimpact on the supply of some key components.  And there hadbeen reports of disruption to output in other areas reliant onJapanese electronics.  The incidence of bank holidays in Aprilwas likely to provide an additional source of volatility inmonthly output data.
Construction
The Agents’ score suggested that construction output hadgrown a little compared to a year earlier.  Building of new retailoutlets, budget hotels and warehousing continued to supportthe level of activity, along with some large public sectorinfrastructure and transport projects.  There had been a smallpickup in house building and there was a significant increase innew office space under construction in London.  Elsewherethere was very little property being built that had not alreadybeen pre-let.  Most contacts had seen a fall in public sectororders, and that was expected to weigh on the growth rate ofactivity going forward, although there had been some increasein repair and maintenance work on government property.
Credit conditions
Large firms and some medium-sized businesses reported thatthey were typically able to borrow if needed.  Small firmsgenerally perceived credit conditions to be very tight.  Andmany small firms were reluctant to approach banks in case itled to an increase in the cost of existing borrowings, orreductions in overdraft limits.  There had been an increase inthe use of asset-based finance for investment.  And some smallfirms were slowly making greater use of different types offinancing for working capital, such as invoice discounting, thatwere available in place of overdrafts.
Employment
Private sector employment intentions pointed to furthermodest employment growth over the coming six months.  Inmanufacturing, robust export growth was leading to additionalhiring of temporary workers.  And past hires of temporary staffwere increasingly being made permanent, reflectingconfidence in the new level of activity.  Historical shortages ofcertain skills, especially in engineering, were becoming asource of concern again, prompting some firms to offer moreapprenticeships.  In services, some recruitment was plannedamong firms serving the manufacturing sector, particularly indistribution.  And modest hiring was expected in theprofessional and financial sector.  Employment intentions wereweaker among consumer-facing firms than for those facingbusiness.  A few firms, which were already at minimum staffinglevels, were considering shorter opening hours, shouldconsumer demand fail to pick up.Capacity utilisation
Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector was, on
balance, around normal, with constraints on productiongreatest among exporters.  There were a few instances of firmssupplying the domestic market that were nearing capacity, butmost could raise production by implementing additional shiftsif required.  They remained reluctant to do so, however, becauseof uncertainty about the outlook for demand.  In the servicesector, slack was gradually dwindling among professional andfinancial firms, due to rising demand and competitive pressuresthat had raised the amount of effort required to secure acontract.  Among providers of other services to the corporatesector, such as conferencing, there was still considerable scopeto undertake more work, whereas those with close links to themanufacturing sector were beginning to face constraints.  Therewas significant spare capacity in consumer-facing businesses.
Costs and prices
Labour costs
Labour costs continued to rise at a moderate pace in themanufacturing sector.  Growth in settlements largely reflectedcompensation for past wage freezes and the wish to pass onimprovements in profitability, as well as some recognition ofthe higher cost of living.  And there were a few instances ofquite generous settlements for those staff with skills that werein particularly short supply — some engineers and niche legalor financial services professionals, for instance.  Efforts toexpand production were also leading to a rise in average hoursand overtime payments, and bonuses for strong performance.In the service sector, labour costs were rising at a slightlyslower pace than in manufacturing, with pay freezes remainingfairly common.  As in manufacturing, there had been more useof performance-related pay, and targeting of awards to retainkey individuals.  Across sectors, there was little pressure fromstaff or unions for above-inflation settlements.  But somecontacts were concerned that if inflation remained elevated,wage demands would strengthen.
Non-labour costs
The prices of a range of materials, such as timber, metals andoil-based products, continued to rise rapidly compared to ayear earlier.  And the price of various food commodities,including milk, butter and meat, had also been increasingquickly.  But the pace of increase in materials costs wasthought not to have accelerated any further.  Finished goodsprice inflation remained elevated, due to the rise in the price ofraw materials, higher transport costs, and rising wages in someemerging markets.
Output prices
Manufacturing output prices continued to grow at a steadypace ( Chart 3 ).  But rising costs had only been passed on inpart.  That was sometimes because the domestic demand
environment remained weak, or because firms were pricetakers from large buyers.  And some firms had re-engineeredproducts to make less use of materials that had risen sharply inprice, or had invested to reduce waste, to try to offset risingcosts.  Food producers continued to experience strongresistance from supermarkets to price increases.  Amongcontacts in the service sector, prices were growing only verygradually, reflecting slack in the sector and relatively weakerdemand conditions than in manufacturing ( Chart 3 ).  This was
especially true of professional and financial services, and inother business services serving the corporate market, forinstance in conferencing and hospitality.  In transportation andlogistics some firms had been able to invoke fuel escalatorclauses to pass on increased costs.
Consumer prices
The Agents’ score continued to point to an elevated pace ofconsumer goods price inflation over the past twelve months.Contacts attributed the increase in prices to the rise in VAT,and the higher cost of transportation, materials and finishedgoods.  But there remained considerable use of promotions todrive footfall, and discounting of big ticket items had beendeeper than usual.  Downward pressure on high street pricesfrom on-line retailers had intensified.  Looking ahead, somecontacts thought that margins on clothing had become verythin, due to increases in the cost of fabrics, and suggested thatthere would be a rise in the price of autumn ranges if demandconditions permitted.
The increase in VAT had also added to the pace of inflation in
consumer services.  And higher fuel costs had pushed up theprices of travel and transportation.  The prices of variousessential services had also risen quickly, including for housingrent and insurance.  But for businesses in those sectors whereexpenditure was largely discretionary, for instance in the hoteland restaurant trades, inflation remained muted.4
