January 2012Demand
Consumption
The rate of growth of consumer spending remained weak
(Chart 1 ).  And discounting in the run-up to Christmas had
started earlier, and been deeper, than last year.  Despite somefillip from bargain hunters, however, the squeeze onhouseholds’ real disposable income continued to depress theoverall volume of consumption and cause shifts in the patternof spending.  Value goods and services continued tooutperform mid-range ones, for instance.  And rising prices foressential services, such as transport and housing, had reducedthe amount left over for spending on leisure activities.  Manycontacts expressed concerns about the possibility of a sharpfall in the volume of consumption in the first quarter,compared with a year earlier.
Housing market
Activity in the housing market remained subdued.  And therehad also been an increase in the frequency of breaks in housingmarket chains, as buyers withdrew offers, which contactsattributed to concerns about the economic outlook.  First-timebuyers typically still struggled to raise the deposit required tosecure a mortgage, pushing up the demand for rentalproperties and rents.  The London market continued to besupported by inflows of money from abroad, in part because itwas perceived to be a safe haven for international investors.The higher end of the housing market also continued to showsome resilience, with the supply of new homes increasinglytargeted at this segment.  A reduction in government grants tohousing associations had lowered the supply of social housing.
Business investment
Investment intentions continued to weaken, but still pointedto an increase in capital spending over the coming year (Chart 2 ), with plans usually strongest among exporters.
Heightened uncertainty had caused some investment to beput on hold, or scaled back, with a greater focus on thepreservation of cash flow, particularly among smaller firms.And there had been fewer reports of plans to increase capacity,
as past projects came to fruition.  But many contactscontinued to invest in raising efficiency, lowering energy use,waste reduction and regulatory compliance.  Spending wasalso still being supported by some large infrastructure projectsin transportation and the energy and utilities sectors, althoughsome major schemes would go into abeyance for severalmonths around the time of the Olympics.  
Exports
Goods exports continued to grow at a fairly steady pace, buthad slowed somewhat.  The increase in exports reflected risingdemand in emerging economies and a shift in the orientationof both established exporters and newly exporting firmstowards these growth markets.  Businesses supplying theaerospace, automotive and energy sectors were among thoseseeing the most resilient demand, while high commodityprices had encouraged an increase in mineral extraction inlarge areas of the developing world, increasing the demand forexports of construction plant.  A number of exportersremained optimistic about their ability to continue to expandtheir share of the market in emerging economies, despiteslowing growth in some of these countries.  Meanwhile,activity in the euro area had softened, particularly amongthose countries most affected by concerns over sovereigndebt.
Output
Business services
The growth rate of turnover in business services continued toease, due to slowing demand growth and downward pressureon price inflation, particularly among professional and financialservices.  Some contacts attributed the weakening in activityto the impact on confidence of problems in the euro area.  Andslower growth in manufacturing was having knock-on effectsfor the suppliers of a range of ancillary services, such ashaulage and industrial cleaning.  Regulatory and compliancework continued to support demand, however, and providers ofIT services and telecoms continued to grow on the back of2

clients’ efforts to find efficiencies and cut costs.  There had also
been some increase in outsourcing by the public sector.  Largelegal and accountancy firms were increasingly chasing marketshare, leading to consolidation in the sector and forcing somesmaller businesses to exit.
Manufacturing
The annual growth rate of manufacturing output destined forthe domestic market had edged down, but remained positive.Reports were increasingly mixed, however, and some contactsthought that orders were becoming more volatile and smallerin size.  Firms in supply chains for goods that were ultimatelydestined for export were still growing at a solid pace, forinstance in the aerospace and energy sectors.  But weakdomestic demand continued to weigh on a range ofmanufacturers, including suppliers of durable consumer goodsand construction materials and on the defence industry.  Therehad been relatively few reports of disruption to output due toflooding in Thailand.  
Construction
Contacts in construction reported a slight weakening in thelevel of activity compared with the same period a year earlier.Public sector work had contracted as some large-scale projectswere completed.  And more generally, contacts reported thatwhat work there was tended to be small-scale, was fiercelyfought over on price, and was often subject to delays inprocurement.  There was some support to activity from theprivate sector, particularly from energy and transportinfrastructure.  And there had been an increase in theconstruction of warehousing space and distribution facilities, inpart due to the growth of on-line sales.  But the pace ofexpansion of some of the big national retailers had slowed,and there was little speculative office development underwayoutside London.  Difficulties in securing planning permissioncontinued to be a source of frustration for many contacts.
Credit conditions
Businesses with strong balance sheets generally had access tocredit.  But small companies frequently reported thatconditions remained tight, and were often wary of approachingbanks for loans, fearing re-pricing of existing facilities orrequests for increased security against lending, such aspersonal guarantees.  Among those contacts that had recentlybeen in touch with their lenders, there were a few instances ofa tightening in credit conditions in recent months, particularlyfor longer-term lending.  But for most firms, higher fundingcosts for banks did not appear to have been passed on yet.Anticipating such a change, however, there was a rising note ofcaution among contacts, with many businesses focused onbuilding up cash holdings, in case of a change in the position oftheir banks.  This had been given added impetus by a squeezeon working capital as payment times began to lengthen.  Andsome firms were building up cash buffers in case declines in
bond yields caused upward revisions to the size of pensionfund deficits.  
Employment
Employment intentions in the private sector continued toweaken, and suggested that employment was unlikely to growover the next six months ( Chart 3 ).  Manufacturers often
reported that they were taking a pause from furtherrecruitment, in light of heightened uncertainty about theoutlook and a slowing in orders.  The weakest plans wereamong those supplying the domestic economy, particularlyhouseholds and the construction sector.  In business services,many firms had seen margins come under renewed pressure.That was most acute in sectors where there remainedsignificant overcapacity, for instance, in legal and accountancywork and haulage.  Having already pared back non-labourcosts as much as possible during the recession, many businessservices contacts now felt that they would be forced to reducestaff numbers.  And there was likely to be a further shakeout inthe financial services industry.  Consumer-facing firms wereoften already at minimum staffing levels.  But store closureswere expected to cause employment to fall, despite some jobcreation by the larger retailers.
Capacity utilisation
In the manufacturing sector, capacity utilisation had fallenback a little in recent months, due to past investment andrecruitment, along with a slowing in the pace of growth of neworders ( Chart 4 ).  Capacity utilisation was generally highest
among exporters, with those supplying households and theconstruction sector tending to exhibit much higher levels ofslack.  Some firms expressed concerns about supplybottlenecks, for example, due to shortages of hard disk drivesfollowing the flooding in Thailand, although the impact of thison output so far had been fairly muted.5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4

–Growth over the next six monthsChart 3 Employment intentionsIn services, slowing activity had caused spare capacity to begin
to open up again, and flexible working arrangements wereincreasingly being used to adjust staffing levels quickly, tomeet changes in demand.  But further consolidation wasthought to be required in a number of sectors.  That wasespecially apparent in the intensity of competition in somelegal and accountancy services, and among those supplyingthe construction sector.  Consumer-facing businesses typicallyhad ample scope to accommodate more customers, withstaffing often already at minimum levels.  Some firms wereopening shorter hours, in response to softening demand, withstore closures the last resort.
Costs and prices
Labour costs
The pace of growth of total labour costs had slowed a littleover the past few months, reflecting weakening profitability,and a deterioration in the outlook, particularly among servicesfirms.  Settlements remained fairly modest, with the biggestincreases tending to be concentrated among manufacturers,particularly exporters, or where there were shortages ofparticular skills, as in IT, for instance.  Elsewhere, pay freezeshad become more common.  And there continued to be ageneral move away from across-the-board settlements toperformance-based awards and bonuses.  Looking ahead,many contacts expected settlements in the upcoming payround to be at or below the percentage increases seen lastyear.  Wage drift had eased, due to weaker growth in profitsthan expected this year and a fall in the use of overtime as thepace of growth had moderated.  So far, the Agency WorkersRegulations had not had much impact on the wage bill formost contacts, although it had caused a small increase inadministrative costs for a few.  Non-labour costs
There had been a further slowing in the annual rate of inflationin raw materials costs.  Recently the price of some inputs hadeven fallen, due to weaker world demand growth.  Forinstance, cotton prices had fallen significantly from recentpeaks, along with some metals and basic foods.  Moredownward pressure was expected to come, given thedeterioration in the outlook for global growth.  But higherenergy costs continued to feed through to businesses ascontracts came up for renewal.  Inflation in the price ofimports remained elevated, in large part due to past increasesin the cost of raw materials, as well as higher labour costs in anumber of emerging market economies.  Import price inflationwas expected to fall back over the course of 2012, however,due to the slowing in the pace of increase in raw materialsprices.  A few contacts reported that the price of hard diskdrives had risen sharply, due to supply shortages.
Output prices
Manufacturing output price inflation had yet to decline,despite some slowing in cost growth, as contacts continued topass on some of the past increase in raw materials prices.  Butthis was usually only partial.  And a number of contacts,particularly producers of consumer goods, expected to comeunder pressure from the large retailers to pass on any recentreductions in input costs.  Business services price inflation hadsoftened in recent months, reflecting slowing activity, andmore intense competitive pressures.  And the effect of fuelescalator clauses was also beginning to drop out of the annualcomparison, reducing inflation in charges for haulage, forexample.  That masked some differences between sectors,however, with niche service providers sometimes able toachieve increases in fees, while suppliers of staple legal andaccountancy services often had to reduce their prices, or offerfixed charges for multi-year contracts.
Consumer prices
The rate of inflation remained elevated.  Goods prices hadbeen pushed up in large part by increases in VAT at thebeginning of 2011, and higher energy prices.  There had alsobeen fairly sharp price rises for a range of essential services,including for transportation and rented accommodation, oftenlinked to official measures of inflation.  But there had beensome moderation in the pace of increase in food prices, andthere had been more aggressive discounting among retailers inthe run-up to Christmas compared with last year, particularlyfor winter clothing lines, due to stock overhangs followingunseasonably mild weather.  Suppliers of non-essentialservices were also making more extensive use of promotionsthan in the past, with discounts increasingly used to getcustomers through the door.4

–Chart 4 Capacity utilisationAgents’ survey on consumer spending over the
Christmas period
The Agents contacted a broad range of retailers and leisure
service providers in late December and early January to get aview of sales over the Christmas period.  225 businessesparticipated in the survey.  
Weighting the responses by turnover, around 75% of those
surveyed reported positive growth in nominal sales comparedwith a year earlier ( Chart A ).  This was in part due to rising
prices, as well as the relatively weak performance the previousyear, when shoppers’ plans were disrupted by extreme weatherconditions during much of the Christmas trading period. 
Contacts also thought that there had been a boost to spending
this year because the timing of the holidays allowed for a fullweek of trading ahead of Christmas.  And many reported astronger online performance in 2011, perhaps because therewas less concern among shoppers this Christmas thatdeliveries would be disrupted by the weather.  Some of thiswas at the expense of in-store sales.
Three quarters of those surveyed, when weighted by turnover,
also reported that their sales performance had been in linewith, or above, expectations ( Chart B ).  But expectations were
often modest to begin with;  a number of retailers reportedthat they had revised down their targets for Christmas,reflecting weaker than expected performance earlier in theyear.
Respondents were also asked about the timing and magnitude
of promotional activity.  Contacts reported that discountinghad begun earlier and had been deeper in 2011 compared withthe previous year.  In part, that was because the level ofinventories had been relatively high going into the festiveperiod.  There was reported to have been excess stock of
winter clothing and footwear, due to the mild weather, as wellas an overhang of electrical and some other big ticket items.Once on promotion, surplus inventory fell quickly, with someretailers reporting record sales for the period either side ofChristmas.  But the extent of discounting meant that marginshad been squeezed.
Looking ahead, contacts were asked how they expected sales
to go during the first quarter of 2012, compared with the sameperiod a year earlier ( Chart C ).  When weighted by turnover,
responses to this question were broadly balanced.  Thatsuggested that turnover was expected to be broadlyunchanged on a year earlier.  Given increases in prices over thepast year, that pointed to something rather weaker for thevolume of consumption.
The mix of responses suggested that some firms expected to
win market share at the expense of others.  For instance, foodretailers tended to be more optimistic than non-food retailers,while contacts within the consumer services industry were onbalance slightly more positive than sellers of goods.
