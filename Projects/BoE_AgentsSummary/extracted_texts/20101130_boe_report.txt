November 2010Demand
Consumption
The Agents’ score for annual retail sales growth eased lower
(Chart 1 ).  The uncertain economic outlook was reported to be
weighing on consumer confidence, and discretionary spendingon big-ticket consumer durables such as consumer electronicsand homeware had waned as a result.  Recent levels of privatecar registrations were better than dealers had expected, butnonetheless were lower than a year earlier due to the end ofthe government’s scrappage scheme. 
Demand for consumer services continued to accelerate
modestly ( Chart 1 ).  Hotel occupancy and air travel had
increased, assisted by higher numbers of overseas tourists.  Butdiscretionary spending at pubs, restaurants and nightclubscontinued to weaken in the face of declining consumerconfidence.   
Housing market
Some contacts reported further declines in housingtransactions volumes.  The main cause of that slowdown wasthought to be a perceived deterioration in the economicoutlook.  Expectations of further declines in house prices hadalso reduced demand for owner-occupied housing.  Bycontrast, in the rental market demand had risen to matchhitherto excess levels of housing supply and rental yields hadfirmed a little — especially in parts of southern England.Access to mortgage finance had improved slightly in the buy-to-let market, and investor demand for residentialproperty had continued to rise moderately — stimulated bythe low rates of return available on liquid assets.  
Business investment
Both current and planned levels of investment in the serviceand manufacturing sectors had continued to acceleratemoderately ( Chart 2 ).  Following measures to curtail running
costs during the recession, many contacts were now benefitingfrom increased profitability owing to the recovery in demand
in the past year.  Some contacts were using surplus funds todeleverage and/or accumulate cash balances.  But manyothers were gradually increasing capital spending.  Typically,large firms were more willing to raise planned investment thansmall and medium-sized enterprises, and had relatively greatercash reserves to do so.  National retailers (and, to a lesserextent, some financial institutions) had raised the level ofcapital spending on their estate of properties recently —including the construction of new stores and therefurbishment of existing premises.  In most cases, however,contacts’ investment decisions focused more on efficiencyimprovements than on expanding capacity.  Ageing vehicleswere being replaced due to rising maintenance costs ofexisting fleets;  IT investment was being stepped up in part toreduce labour requirements;  and commercial property wasbeing refurbished in preference to the occupier moving tomore costly premises.  Looking forward, many multinationalcompanies planned to invest surplus profits in new capacity inemerging economies.  
Exports
Growth in exports of manufactures remained robust.Following a period of sustained acceleration, the Agentsreported a rather more mixed picture for exports in the pastmonth.  Many contacts reported continued buoyancy inoverseas demand, particularly in emerging economies andespecially for commercial aeroplanes, cars and relatedcomponents.  But some observed that growth had lostmomentum recently.  Some contacts cited the restraininginfluence on demand for UK manufactured goods of increasingfiscal consolidation across Europe.  Others reported that there-stocking cycle in overseas markets that had been evidentearlier in the year had now run its course.  Turning to theservice sector, there was stronger growth in overseas demandfor the professional services of UK lawyers, engineeringconsultants and advertising agencies.  And net tourismrevenues had increased on account of higher numbers ofoverseas tourists.  2

Import growth remained firm.  The extent of import
substitution — whereby contacts had switched from overseasto domestic suppliers — remained muted and was exceeded bythe number of reports citing the unavailability of UKmanufactured products.
Output
Business services
Turnover for professional and financial services continued toincrease, but at a slightly slower rate than in recent months.That modest deceleration mostly reflected weaker publicsector demand for various professional services, including ITand training consultants, and recruitment and advertisingagencies.  Overall, the Agents reported the recovery in demandremained intact, but that prospects of a more robust pickupwere very uncertain in the short term.  This partly reflectedconcerns that prospective public sector spending cuts wouldfurther restrain activity.  And while some modest growth wasevident recently, volumes of mergers and acquisitions andcommercial property transactions (seen as important drivers ofvalue-added in the sector) remained subdued.  
Growth in demand for other business-to-business services was
broadly stable.  Corporate spending on entertainment,conferencing and travel — especially air travel to emergingmarket destinations — continued to accelerate gently, but thathad been largely offset by reduced demand from public sectorbodies.  Spending on road haulage services had grown at aslightly quicker pace, though that mostly reflected higheroutput price inflation due to increasing fuel surcharges.  
Manufacturing
Manufacturing output growth for the domestic market wassteady, following a sustained period of recovery.  There weretentative signs that a deceleration in public sector spendinghad started to weaken domestic demand — for example,manufacturers of defence-related capital goods reportedweaker orders and the occasional cancellation of projects.  Bycontrast, output of some intermediate goods such aschemicals (used in paint manufacturing, for example) hadstrengthened a little.  Some contacts speculated that themuch-reduced level of housing and commercial propertytransactions had stimulated demand for products associatedwith repair and maintenance.   
Construction
Contacts reported broadly unchanged construction activitycompared with last year’s weak levels.  A few privatecommercial projects had restarted recently, and activity inGreater London had been supported by some large projectssuch as the London Olympics.  But there were tentative reportsthat homebuilders had suffered a downturn in demandrecently, resulting in lower numbers of housing starts.  Levelsof publicly financed construction had been maintained.  Going
forward, the planned cuts in Government capital spendingcontinued to weigh on confidence in the sector.
Credit conditions
There remained a substantial divergence in the creditconditions faced by contacts with robust balance sheets (oftenlarger firms) and those experiencing either poor tradingconditions or impaired balance sheets.
For some firms in the former group, access to external finance
was more or less back to normal, although the cost of funds interms of margin over Bank Rate remained somewhat elevated.Some contacts reported that bank credit was readily available.Others were increasingly able to tap equity and bond markets.Access to trade credit insurance continued to improve.
However, banks remained risk-averse when lending to firms
with less robust balance sheets.  Numerous reports werereceived of small firms having overdraft facilities eitherreduced or withdrawn, and instead having to access moreexpensive asset-backed finance (typically invoice discounting).Since those firms often already suffered from low margins,these additional costs were often onerous.  
Employment
Private sector employment intentions improved a little morein the service sector, but were slightly weaker inmanufacturing.  The Agents’ scores were consistent withpositive, if only modest, employment growth in both sectorsover the next year.  
Employment prospects in the business and consumer services
sectors had improved slightly.  Firms in professional andfinancial services were recruiting, in part, to accommodatefuture regulatory and compliance requirements.  And retailers’demand for lesser-skilled and part-time workers had risencommensurate with the net expansion of floor-space.  Whilesome major retailers were planning further labour sheddingdue to the weak outlook for consumer spending, overall thecontinued expansion of the national supermarkets held sway.Some contacts in the leisure industry had raised staffing levelsdue to the upturn in tourism.  Manufacturers’ employmentintentions had weakened slightly in the face of a somewhatmore subdued outlook for demand growth.  Contacts hadfound recruiting skilled workers slightly more difficult recently.  
Capacity utilisation
The amounts of spare capacity in the service andmanufacturing sectors were reported to be little changed inOctober, having gradually reduced over the past year or so(Chart 3 ).  The Agents’ scores for capacity utilisation in both
sectors were now only slightly below normal.  Demand hadbegun to recover, and many firms had reduced the quantum ofresources employed during the recession, in order to bettermatch running costs with lower revenues.  Jobs had been shed,hours of work reduced (for example by employing more part-time workers), capital had been mothballed or scrappedand investment delayed, and many manufacturers hadreduced the number of shifts being worked.  Even so, manycontacts were in a position where, should demand recoverfurther, they could fairly quickly redeploy thoseunderemployed resources.  However, some bottlenecks hademerged during the recession that might delay thisredeployment.  For example, some UK supply chains haddisappeared, and contacts had become more dependent onglobal suppliers whose prime focus was on servicing overseasmarkets.  
Costs and prices
Labour costs
Labour cost growth was steady in the service sector but hadincreased in manufacturing — in part reflecting that sector’scomparatively stronger recovery in output this year.  Thosefirms that had seen a marked recovery in demand andprofitability during 2010 were more willing and able to awardslightly higher pay settlements and bonus payments than lastyear, especially to their core skilled workers.  Overall, thehistorical link between pay and RPI inflation had continued todissipate, and companies were increasingly trying to focus paypots on rewarding their most productive workers.  
Non-labour costs
Material cost inflation had increased, but imported goodsinflation had eased further.  Evidence of increasing materialsprices was fairly widespread.  Some of the recent increases inthe spot prices of metals, textiles and arable commodities hadstarted to feed through into higher prices being paid bymanufacturers.  Utility costs, which until recently had beenfalling, were now rising again.  (However, the full impact ofhigher spot material prices was likely to be drawn out,
reflecting the frequent use of forward contracts by manyfirms.)  But the picture was not entirely one-sided, with, forexample, reports of lower price inflation for some otherfoodstuffs such as fruit and vegetables, reflecting bumperharvests.  
The rate of inflation for imported finished goods continued to
ease back from recent elevated levels.  With excess globalcapacity still evident in many industries, contacts were able tonegate some of the inflationary pressures emanating fromChina by re-sourcing supplies from other Far Eastern emergingeconomies.  
Output prices
Manufacturing output price inflation was reported to beunchanged.  Manufacturers had sought to recover recentincreases in non-labour costs through higher output prices, butoverall their customers had been largely successful in resistingmost of manufacturers’ proposed price rises.  A case in pointwas the increased cost of arable foodstuffs faced by foodmanufacturers.  Few had been successful in passing theseincreases on to the supermarkets.  Business-to-businessservices prices remained slightly lower than a year earlier.Professional services fees for work related to corporatetransactions and commercial property management remainedunder downward pressure.  And charge-out rates ofconsultants and fees charged by some advertising agencieshad softened as public sector clients increasingly negotiateddiscounts.  By contrast, haulage prices had firmed owing toincreases in fuel surcharges.
Consumer prices
Consumer goods price inflation was steady but services priceshad accelerated a little further.  Retail food price inflation wasstable, in spite of increasing inflationary pressures in the supplychain.  New car prices had fallen.  Retail price inflation forclothing and footwear had increased and contacts expectedfurther significant price increases in the coming months.  Priceinflation for a variety of consumer services had also increasedin recent months.  Household insurance premiums for motorcars had risen sharply;  prices of hotel rooms and air travel hadrisen in response to stronger demand;  and housing rents hadfirmed a little.  But pricing had been somewhat softer for thoseconsumer services suffering from weak demand, includingrestaurants and some leisure activities.  The Agents continuedto report that the 2011 VAT rise was likely to be passed on infull by a majority of contacts.  4

–Over the next six months relative to normalAgents’ survey on capital expenditure
Following an unprecedented decline during the recession,
recent ONS data have suggested that business investmentbegan to grow again during the first half of this year.
To help to assess the likely pace of the recovery in investment,
the Agents surveyed contacts’ planned investment
(1)levels in
the coming year relative to their actual spending in theprevious year;  the key drivers of planned investment;  andwhether those plans would be reviewed in light of the HM Treasury Spending Review .  283 firms responded to the
survey.
(2)
Weighting contacts’ responses by turnover, the survey resultssuggested that investment plans over the next twelve monthswere more positive than outturns had been over the pasttwelve months ( Chart A ).  Fewer firms wished to cut capital
expenditure than a year ago, and those that had increasedspending over the past year planned to increase spending bymore in the coming year. 
By sector, business services and construction respondents no
longer intended to cut investment, and firms in manufacturingand consumer services planned to increase investmentmarkedly.  That was consistent with Agents’ reports of a pickupin planned investment, particularly in manufacturing.
Small and medium-sized firms
(3)were more likely to have cut
investment over the past year, and larger firms to haveincreased investment a little.  Overall, the net balance was foran increase in expenditure over the next year, although againsentiment was more positive for larger firms.
Contacts were also asked to indicate the most significant
influences
(4)upon their investment plans, and the direction ofthat influence ( Chart B ).  Demand uncertainty and capacity
were seen as the primary impediments to investment,particularly for firms in construction and, to a lesser degree, inbusiness services.  The overall impact of finance was broadlyneutral, as the positive reported balance for internal financeroughly offset the negative balance for the cost and availabilityof external finance.  The resumption of postponed assetreplacement provided a strong positive driver of intentions.Other factors such as health and safety, regulation andaddressing inefficiencies were also regarded as key influenceson investment plans.
Financing conditions appeared to be more of a constraint to
smaller firms.  The availability of internally generated fundingwas reported to be weighing on investment intentions for amodest net balance of firms with less than £75 millionturnover.  By contrast, it was cited as a positive factor for firmswith turnover above that threshold.  But external financeconditions remained a negative factor for all firms.
Survey responses indicated that one third of firms sampled (on
an unweighted basis) intended to reappraise their investmentplans in light of the Spending Review .  Chart A Investment plans over next twelve months
