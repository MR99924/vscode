July 2014Demand
Consumption
Retail sales values growth had been steady, having picked
up sharply last month ( Chart 1 ).  Growth in food sale values
had weakened, as competition for market share had ledsome supermarkets to reduce prices.  Across retailers, sales growth continued to be strongest for discount and convenience retailers, and online.  Spending onbigger-ticket items, such as fitted kitchens and white goods,had increased, but there were a few reports of sales growthslowing as housing market activity eased.  Growth of newcar sales had also slowed.  Consumer services growth waslittle changed ( Chart 1 ).  The better weather had stimulated
demand for leisure attractions, hotels, pubs andrestaurants.  Growth had also been seen in some areas ofdiscretionary spending, such as healthcare.  Commuter trainjourneys had increased further, reflecting employmentgrowth.
Housing market
The slowdown in housing market activity had become morewidespread, although transactions were still up on a year ago.Demand for housing-related services, such as estate agentsand conveyancing had also slowed.  Implementation of theMortgage Market Review and a shortage of new propertiescoming onto the market were seen as the main factors behindeasing activity.  The slowdown in activity was most evident inthe secondary market.  The new-build market had remainedmore buoyant, in part due to the boost to first-time buyertransactions from the Help to Buy equity loan scheme.Despite easing activity, there was little sign as yet of ageneralised slowdown in annual house price inflation, thoughcontacts in London thought price inflation there had peaked,especially at the top end of the market.  Elsewhere, significantprice inflation was typically restricted to the most desirableneighbourhoods where multiple bidders were often competingfor only a few properties.  Business investment
Contacts’ capital expenditure plans suggested steady growthin investment over the next twelve months.  Greaterconfidence in demand was generating growth in capitalspending, though some caution remained.  Investment growthintentions were a touch weaker in manufacturing than inservices, mainly reflecting some strong investment in newindustrial production capacity over the past year.  Only aminority of manufacturers were now investing to addsignificant capacity.  In services, activity around refurbishmentof existing premises, relocation, and expansion into newpremises had picked up, supporting investment in commercialreal estate.  Investment to replace vehicles and IT equipmenthad remained high.  However, for many services firms therewas often more focus on intangible investment, for instancebrand and product development and staff training, rather thancapital spending.  Large discount retailers had stepped up thepace of new retail openings and the associated logisticscapacity.
Exports
Manufacturing export values growth had remained moderate.The effect of sterling’s appreciation over the past year onexport volumes had been limited to date, with most of thoseexporters that had not been hedged absorbing the impact bylowering margins.  Further appreciation would potentially havea greater effect on export volumes as exporters felt there waslittle scope to lower margins further.  And even if sterlingremained at its current level, some contacts expected anegative effect on volumes to feed through over time as theywould need to respond by raising export prices.  Export growthhad continued to be maintained in the automotive sector andfor prestige UK brands.  Demand from Europe had edged upoverall and exports to the United States had continued tostrengthen.  Appetite for exporting to emerging markets hadeased a little as demand was generally weaker, and the effectsof political instability in Ukraine had started to restrain exportsto both there and Russia.  Services exports had strengthenedfurther.  Business travel into the United Kingdom hadincreased on a year ago, as had foreign tourist numbers.Demand for architectural design and engineering consultancyservices continued to be strong, and software businessesreported buoyant global activity.
Output
Business services
Business services turnover growth had been little changed(Chart 2 ).  Activity was reported to be growing across a wide
range of subsectors.  In professional and financial services,corporate finance had remained one of the strongest areas.The recent surge of pent-up demand for initial public offeringsand mergers and acquisitions activity had eased, but contactsreported a strong pipeline ahead.  Activity in a range of2

property-related services had risen strongly alongside
strengthening commercial real estate investment andconstruction activity.  Reports of activity growth in legalservices were more mixed.  Other business services turnovergrowth had been steady.  Demand for IT, creative media andtelecommunication services had increased as corporatebudgets had loosened and the shift towards online retailinghad continued.  In contrast, more traditional media publishershad continued to report declining volumes.  Conference andcorporate entertainment spending was reported to beincreasing. 
Manufacturing
Manufacturing output for the domestic market had continuedto grow steadily ( Chart 2 ), and forward order books had
remained healthy.  Growth was strongest in automotive,energy, rail infrastructure, homeware goods (furniture andfurnishings) and the construction supply chain.  The pace ofaerospace orders growth had slowed, but there remained alarge backlog to fulfill.  Food and drink volumes had risen, asretailers and pubs stocked up in anticipation of World Cupsales.  Growth was weakest in defence, paper and printing andthe supply chain for truck manufacture — the latter havingpreviously been boosted by purchases ahead of new emissionsregulations.
Construction
Construction activity had continued to rise strongly ( Chart 2 ),
with the pickup widening from house building.  Public sectorinvestment in health, education, roads, rail, energy and otherinfrastructure had been stronger than many contacts’expectations.  Private sector investment in buildings was alsostronger, particularly in warehousing and distribution, hotelsand student accommodation.  However, construction activityin new office capacity had remained weak in many citiesoutside London.  In house building, output continued to growstrongly with evidence that smaller builders had becomeincreasingly active as credit conditions had eased.  Materialsand labour shortages were regularly cited as a constraint by
builders, along with the availability of land with planningconsent in some areas.  Some contacts also noted that plantand machinery were in short supply.
Credit conditions
Credit conditions had continued to improve with few reportsof companies not being able to obtain finance.  Corporate andbank contacts reported increased competition to lend tocompanies with strong balance sheets, with some noting afurther easing of loan pricing and covenants.  More generally,most firms reported being able to borrow from banks,although the rates and terms available still deterred somefrom seeking funds or led them to look for alternative sources.Loan application processes were widely reported by contactsto be drawn out, and potentially a deterrent to some,especially micro businesses.  Net lending growth hadcontinued to be adversely affected by the unwinding of legacypositions by some banks, but gross lending had strengthened,especially to some higher-risk small and medium-sizedenterprises, and there was now more appetite to lend againstsmaller-scale commercial property collateral.  Challengerbanks were seen by some contacts to be growing insignificance, and non-bank alternatives, such as peer-to-peerlending and crowdfunding, were reported to be an increasingsource of finance for some firms.  There were reports of earlyrefinancing of facilities in order to lock in current low interestrates.  In commercial real estate there were some reports ofborrowers increasing debt levels after a prolonged period ofdebt reduction. 
Employment 
A pickup in employment intentions had gathered momentumacross all sectors this month and implied moderate workforcegrowth ( Chart 3 ).  Recruitment of apprentices and graduate
trainees to combat existing and anticipated skill shortages wasincreasingly reported, as was recruitment ahead of expecteddemand growth.  In recent quarters some contacts had raisedemployment by more than they had previously intended, inlight of the stronger-than-expected economic recovery.Intentions in business services were strongest, particularly inIT, property and construction-related services.  Recruitment inconsumer services had largely reflected increasing retailfloorspace, but in some cases had been driven by growingonline business or was aimed at improving customer service.Manufacturing employment intentions had in many casesbeen boosted by new product development and plans toaddress the prospective retirement of some older workers,offset to some extent by a continued focus on automation.Recruitment difficulties had picked up on the month, butremained only modestly above normal.  Skill shortages werestill most widely reported in IT, engineering and construction.Three months on the same period a year earlier

Workforce turnover had picked up and recruitment
bottlenecks were broadening to some other areas as theeconomy strengthened.  Immigration had continued to helpmeet labour demand in some semi-skilled and low-skilledpositions.
Capacity utilisation
Capacity utilisation had been broadly stable at rates that wereslightly above normal.  In manufacturing, investment hadadded capacity in line with rising demand.  In some sectors,such as automotive and electronics, capacity constraints werepressing, pointing to a need for further investment.  Moregenerally, it was expected that productivity growth, togetherwith plans for additional staffing, would be sufficient to meetdemand in the short term.  In the service sector, the overhangof retail, warehousing and prime office space was now falling,supporting a modest pickup in investment in newdevelopments.  Hotel occupancy rates had continued to rise.Capacity in IT services had remained tighter than normal dueto skills shortages, which were reported to be constrainingsome activity and leading to the subcontracting of work toEastern Europe.  Skills shortages were also a problem for thehaulage sector, where levels of utilisation were reported bysome contacts to be high. 
Costs and prices
Labour costs
Growth in total labour costs per employee had remainedmoderate.  The majority of pay settlements had continued tobe in the range of 2%–3%, although some contacts reportedincreasing overtime and profit/performance-related pay.Where there were difficulties in attracting new recruits, orconcern about staff turnover, some contacts had made higherpay awards to certain employees, though these were onlyhaving a modest impact on pay growth overall.  Morepronounced skills shortages in construction were leading toreports of significantly higher awards in that sector, however.
The increase in the National Minimum Wage (NMW)scheduled for October continued to cause concern amongsome contacts, given the possibility that pay for those close tothe NMW would need to rise by a similar amount to maintainexisting pay differentials.  Some contacts noted a continuedshift in workforce composition towards more junior staff, forexample through the increasing use of apprentices, which wasrestraining the growth of their total pay bill.
Non-labour costs
The costs of raw materials and imported finished goods werelower than a year earlier ( Chart 4 ), partly reflecting sterling’s
appreciation over the past year.  Downward pressure onimport costs from sterling’s appreciation was expected tocontinue as forward contracts and hedging arrangementsexpired.  Global commodity price inflation had remainedsubdued, although there had been some reports that suppliersplanned to post increases in metal and meat prices. 
Output prices and margins
Output price inflation had remained modest despite risingdemand.  In manufacturing, some companies reported outputprice rises, but the scale of those was limited given a lack ofraw material and wage cost pressures to justify price rises.Companies supplying supermarkets and other retail outletshad continued to see little prospect of price increases givencompetitive pressures.  But construction materials, the bulkierof which tend to be UK-produced, were seeing upward costpressure.  Business services output price inflation hadincreased marginally on the month.  Professional fees wererising slowly in high value added, specialist sectors such as IT,engineering services and architecture.  There had been furtherevidence of commercial property rents bottoming out, and forprime space small rental increases had been realised.  But insome more commoditised services such as audit, basicaccounting and legal services, competitive pressures hadremained intense and price increases difficult to achieve.Manufacturing profitability growth had remained positive butThree months on the same period a year earlier

had eased back, in part reflecting the effect of sterling’s
appreciation on exporters’ margins.  Service sector profitabilitygrowth had edged higher, as firms felt increasingly able torefuse low price/low margin work and as output and capacityutilisation rose.
Consumer prices
Consumer price inflation had remained subdued.  Retail goodsprice inflation had edged lower due to competition amongsupermarkets and discount retailers.  Price competition hadintensified and there was a move away from vouchers andmulti-buy discounts to lowering prices on a wider range ofitems.  Non-food price inflation, notably in clothing and
household goods, had been restrained by internet retailing.However, given the more normal seasonal weather, clothingretailers’ stock levels were lower than a year earlier and therewas less need to discount in the summer sales.  New car priceshad eased.  Consumer services price inflation had also edgedlower, although remained higher than for goods.  OutsideLondon, many bus operators had moderated fare increases tohelp stimulate demand.  Restaurants, hotels and packageholiday providers had increased prices modestly.  Contactsgenerally reported that consumers remained highly sensitiveto price increases, which was acting to restrain inflation.
