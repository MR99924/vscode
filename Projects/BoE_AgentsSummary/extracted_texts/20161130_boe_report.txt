Agents’ summary of business conditions
November 2016 Update
Annual consumer spending  growth had recovered further 
(Chart 1 ).  Spending on luxury items had increased as overseas 
tourists took advantage of sterling’s fall.  Demand growth for 
new cars had continued to soften. 
Business services  turnover growth had increased a little since 
August, remaining modest ( Chart 2 ).  Contacts in the sector 
remained cautious about business prospects.
There had been a modest increase in manufacturing output  
growth for both domestic and export markets ( Chart 3 ).  
Sterling’s depreciation had aided manufacturing exporters  
and UK businesses competing against imports. 
Construction output  growth had eased ( Chart 4 ), although 
sentiment had improved since the low levels of July. 
A survey of investment intentions  pointed to broadly stable 
or slightly lower investment spending in the year ahead (see 
box on page 2).  Uncertainty concerning future demand and 
trading arrangements was expected to drag on investment.  
Current investment plans were focused on gains in productivity 
and efficiency that could be realised in the short term.
Credit availability  and associated terms were little changed, 
while credit demand from businesses had remained subdued. 
Investor demand for UK commercial real estate  had 
continued to recover although sentiment remained fragile and 
transactions remained low by historical comparison.  Rents 
had continued to rise in many parts of the United Kingdom.Housing market  activity had recovered since the weakness 
seen in the immediate aftermath of the referendum, but the 
extent of the pickup was variable across regions and price 
brackets.  
Manufacturing capacity utilisation  had remained a little 
below normal, but had picked up for exporters.  In services, 
utilisation was slightly above normal but labour constraints  
in professional services had eased.
Employment intentions  were consistent with stable private 
sector employment over the coming six months.  Costs 
associated with the National Living Wage had been weighing 
on recruitment plans for some consumer services businesses.  
Recruitment difficulties  had edged down a little further, 
remaining modestly above normal.
Growth in total labour costs  had remained unchanged with 
most pay awards ranging between 1% and 3%, with slightly 
higher settlements in services than in manufacturing.
Sterling’s depreciation had increased input costs  in many 
sectors ( Chart 5 ).  Manufacturing output price  inflation had 
turned positive and was expected to pick up further as foreign 
currency hedges and fixed-price contracts expired.  Overall, 
corporate profit margins remained slightly lower than normal.
Consumer price inflation  had started to rise, especially for 
goods ( Chart 6 ).  Pass-through of higher prices in supply 
chains to consumer prices had so far been limited, reflecting 
strong competition between retailers.• Business sentiment had recovered further from its post-referendum fall, but remained relatively fragile alongside 
significant uncertainty around the longer-term outlook.  Activity growth had remained resilient.
• A survey pointed to broadly stable or slightly lower investment spending over the coming twelve months  
(see box on page 2), with uncertainty concerning future demand and trading arrangements expected to drag  
on spending.  
• Employment was expected to be broadly flat over the next six months and pay settlements were concentrated 
in the 1–3% range.  Price pressures were building through supply chains following sterling’s depreciation, but 
there had been limited impact on consumer prices to date.
A change to Agents’ scoring of profitability  
Alongside this edition of the Agents’ Summary, a change has been made to the published scores for corporate profitability, with the aim of 
providing a measure that is more relevant to how companies set prices.  These scores will in future be published as profit margins relative to 
normal, rather than as changes on a year earlier, as has previously been the case.  A year’s backrun of the new measures are also provided, 
alongside the other Agents’ scores, at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/agentssummary/default.aspx.  
This publication  generally covers intelligence gathered from business contacts between late August 2016 and mid-October 2016.   
It generally makes comparisons with activity and prices over the past three months on a year earlier.  2 Agents’ summary of business conditions  November 2016 Update
Agents’ survey on investment intentions
The Agents surveyed business contacts about changes to 
investment over the past twelve months and their plans for the 
twelve months ahead.  The survey also asked how a range of 
factors were affecting these investment plans.  In addition, 
firms were asked for information on criteria used to make 
investment decisions, and when and how these have changed.  
Around 340 businesses responded to the survey, accounting 
for 330,000 UK employees and £8.6 billion of UK capital 
spending. The survey results were weighted by employment. 
Overall, firms in the survey reported expectations of broadly 
stable or slightly lower investment spending in the year ahead, 
after quite a significant increase in investment over the past 
year ( Chart A ). 
Notes for chart
(a) For this and subsequent charts, results are weighted by employment within the companies, and then 
re-weighted by sectoral employment shares in aggregate ONS data. 
(b) When calculating the net balance of responses, half weight is given to those responding ‘less’ or 
‘more’, and full weight is given to those that have responded ‘far less’ or ‘far more’. 
Looking across sectors ( Chart B ), expectations for investment 
spending growth in the coming twelve months were most 
negative for construction and business services, particularly 
among financial services companies.  Expectations among 
manufacturing and consumer services companies were for 
broadly flat investment.  By type of capital asset, investment 
plans were weakest for buildings and structures, which could 
explain the cautious outlook among construction firms. Among factors driving investment decisions, the most positive 
influences were the desire to achieve future efficiency gains 
and to provide capacity to meet expected demand ( Chart C ).  
Uncertainty about the demand outlook was the biggest  
drag on investment plans, particularly in manufacturing  
and construction.  Uncertainty about future trading 
arrangements was the other main negative factor, especially 
for manufacturers.  The results suggest that, in aggregate, 
pension deficits are not having a significant impact on firms’ 
investment plans for the coming year. 2010010203040
