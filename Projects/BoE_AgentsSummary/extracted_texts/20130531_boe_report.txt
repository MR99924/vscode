May 2013Demand
Consumption
Annual retail sales values growth had edged higher ( Chart 1 ),
though any growth in volumes remained modest.  Underlyingconsumer demand was reported to remain subdued, consistentwith tight disposable incomes for many.  In addition,unseasonably poor weather had negatively affected sales offashion and outdoor goods and equipment, only partly offsetby a more recent recovery as the weather had improved.Outside retail sales, new car sales had remained strong, withdemand focused on prestige brands on the one hand, or onmodels with low maintenance costs and high fuel efficiency onthe other.  Consumer services demand was reported to haveedged lower as households sought to economise ondiscretionary spending to offset the effect of price rises onsome essential services, such as utilities.  Cold weather hadalso affected demand for outdoor attractions and hotelbookings, though had contributed to a rise in foreign holidaybookings.  There were reports of strengthening housing activitypositively affecting demand for some related services, such asestate agency and, sporadically, for durable goods, such asfurniture. 
Housing market
There were further reports of gradually improving housingmarket activity, both for new home sales and secondarymarket transactions.  That had reflected strengthening demanddue to lower mortgage rates and improved mortgageavailability, including for first-time buyers, though somecontacts reported credit criteria remained tight for highloan to value ratios.  Government-backed incentive schemeswere also seen as contributing to the gentle rise in demand fornew home purchase over recent months.  And there weretentative reports that the introduction of the equity loanelement of the Help to Buy scheme was encouraging morepotential buyers to enter the market.  It was too early forcontacts to reach firm judgements about the scale of thescheme’s effects on either new housing demand or supply —particularly for the mortgage guarantee element to be
introduced in January 2014, further details of which wereawaited.
Business investment
Investment intentions had remained muted, notwithstanding aslight increase in business confidence in recent months.  Inpart, subdued intentions reflected continuing uncertaintyabout future demand.  For manufacturing, investment was saidto be often driven by efficiency gains, and a desire to maintaincompetitiveness, though there were a few more reports ofcompanies in export supply chains investing to expandcapacity or introduce new products.  Among services firms,modest investment intentions were largely related toIT spending, to improve efficiency or often to establish ordevelop e-commerce platforms.  There were also reports ofrising investment in distribution vehicles, in part reflectingtightening emissions standards.  Contacts reported somepickup in the refurbishment of retail stores, hotels and bars, toimprove their attractiveness to consumers in the face of strongcompetitive pressures.  Looking across firm size, some contactsreported a recent slight increase in small and medium-sizedenterprise (SME) investment, in part reflecting increasedcapital spending allowances introduced at the start of the year.Some very large firms reported a preference to invest closer tooverseas markets where growth was more rapid. 
Exports
Manufacturing exports ( Chart 2 ) had continued to pick up
gently on a year earlier, as a result of growth in demandoutside the euro area, with more contacts noting risingdemand from the United States in addition to continuedgrowth in emerging markets.  Among sectors, growth wasoften reported in aerospace, automotive and mining-relatedproduction.  Some services exports were also said to be rising.Those exports were often related to infrastructure projects, orthe extraction of oil and gas, in emerging markets, thoughincreased exports of legal and IT services were also reported.Across sectors, smaller companies reported difficulties inpenetrating overseas markets, partly reflecting constraints in2

results of an Agents’ survey of exports (see pages 6–7), whichmore generally found that respondents’ export values hadgrown over the past year and were expected to rise at a similarpace over the coming twelve months.  In the other direction,food imports were reported to be rising due to the effects ofpoor weather on UK food production, albeit offset partly byincreased domestic sourcing of meat products.  More widely,euro area companies were increasingly targeting UK sales givenweak demand conditions in continental Europe.
Output
Business services
Growth in professional and financial services turnover hadremained modest ( Chart 3 ), though had increased during 2013
so far.  A gradual increase in advisory work related to corporatemergers and acquisitions activity, as well as asset disposals,had continued.  That reflected pressures to consolidate withinthe economy, as well as some increased interest in assetpurchases among venture capital, private equity and foreignbuyers as risk appetite had recovered somewhat in recentmonths.  Commercial property related work was said to berising slightly alongside some increase in transactions.  Butaudit and tax were reported to be flat, with intensecompetition between providers for the available business.Annual growth in other business services turnover had edgedup further.  That was often reported to reflect rising demandfor IT services associated with the development ofe-commerce, with digital marketing and software providersalso benefiting.  For many other companies — such asproviders of corporate hospitality and conferences — turnoverhad remained subdued, though there had been some signs of astrengthening in business-related travel.
Manufacturing
Manufacturing output for the domestic market was reportedto have edged higher, to levels slightly above a year earlier(Chart 2 ).  Growth was largely confined to aerospace,automotive and energy supply chains, often destined
ultimately for export outside of the euro area.  But there werealso reports of rising car production for the domestic marketand of some strengthening in luxury goods production.  Insome cases — such as furniture production — retailers weresaid to be re-sourcing away from overseas suppliers toUK-based manufacturers.  However, with domestic demandstill subdued, and with strong competition from continentalEuropean producers facing overcapacity, the output of manyproducers aiming at domestic consumption was said to beweak.  
Construction
Construction output remained slightly lower than a yearearlier, though in some areas contacts suggested that activityin Q1 had been adversely affected by unusually poor weatherconditions.  There had been some increase in optimism in partsof the sector in recent months, particularly so among largerhouse builders, with signs of increased pre-planning andplanning activity.  There were also signs of more optimismamong smaller house-building contacts, though manycontinued to report their activities remained constrained byfunding and planning constraints.  Some contacts reportedthat social housing build rates were starting to rise, thoughthere were questions about how sustained any increase wouldbe beyond the current year.  In the wider construction sector,small-scale activity in the education and health sectors wassaid to be providing some support to activity, and activity oninfrastructure projects (rail and energy) remained robust.Elsewhere, there remained little sign of improvement inpublicly-funded activity, however, and private sectorcommercial construction was subdued.
Credit conditions
Corporate credit conditions had remained broadly unchanged,albeit with some tentative signs of improvement in bothavailability and demand.  There were continued reports bybusinesses of banks passing on reduced costs of funding intoloan pricing where lending was available and of increasedcompetition to lend to lower credit risk companies as banksaimed to meet lending targets.  With bond finance orUS private placements providing a cheaper source of financefor many large firms, that was leading to some increase in theavailability of bank credit to mid-tier corporates and to somelarger SMEs with strong balance sheets.  But many smallerfirms without suitable collateral found their access to financeremained constrained, with little change in banks’ risk appetitereported — sometimes exhibited in protracteddecision-making processes around loan applications.  Moregenerally, firms that were seeking to enter new marketsreported that access to bank finance remained difficult.Agents’ summary of business conditions May 2013 3

–Three months on the same period a year earlierChart 3 Business services outputThere were some signs reported of a slight rise in credit
demand, due to modest plans to increase investment.  Overall,though, loan demand had remained subdued as manycompanies looked to reduce debts or build up cash reserves, inpart reflecting a desire to reduce their reliance on banks infuture.  A growing use of non-bank finance was reported bySMEs, albeit from low levels, including from peer to peerlending, crowd funding, venture capital funds and insurancecompanies and pension funds.  Within the corporate sector,there were continued reports that customers were extendingthe periods over which they settled invoices.  Bad debts,however, had remained at low levels.  
Employment
Employment intentions pointed to a slight rise in staffinglevels in business services over the coming six months, but flatemployment in manufacturing and consumer services, broadlyconsistent with the relative pattern of demand ( Chart 4 ).
There were also differing patterns within sectors — forexample in manufacturing there were reports of increasingemployment in export supply chains but falls in employmentat some companies focused on the domestic consumer.  In theretail sector, employment levels were often said to be at thelowest levels consistent with acceptable customer servicestandards.  The growth of e-commerce was said not to beleading to lower employment as greater staff numbers wererequired for distribution and websites, while outlets stillneeded to be staffed for ‘click and collect models’, offsettingjob losses from the gradual closure of unprofitable stores.
More generally, where firms’ output was contracting, they
were reported to be reluctant to cut staffing levels.  Thatreflected a number of factors including:  expectations that anydecline in output would be short-lived;  the large one-off costsof redundancy, which meant that natural attrition was thepreferred response;  and the increased use of less experiencedstaff, which had alleviated pressure on wage costs.  It was alsocommonly reported that staff levels needed to be maintainedfor bidding and tendering processes, which had become more
intensive over recent years.
Recruitment difficulties had not materially tightened in recent
months, though there had been a slight widening in reports ofskills shortages beyond IT and engineering to include sales andmarketing staff in some regions, reflecting strong competitionfor available business.  Reports of localised skills shortages hadalso increased slightly, sometimes related to constraints onlabour mobility such as differences in house prices acrossregions.  For the majority of firms, however, recruitment wassaid to be relatively easy by historical standards.
Capacity utilisation
Capacity utilisation had remained slightly below normal inboth manufacturing and services.  In manufacturing sectorswhere some tightness of capacity was reported, such asaerospace, automotive and energy supply chains, it wasreported that some new capacity was being created.Elsewhere, sizable spare manufacturing capacity was oftenreported, leading to some mothballing of production facilitiesfor construction materials in particular.  Professional servicesfirms reported only limited amounts of spare capacity, thoughthe picture often remained one of staff working hard tomaintain output in an environment of weak demand, and ofgradual consolidation within the sector.  Service sectorcapacity constraints were most notable in IT services, while thegreatest degree of slack was in the retail sector, retailcommercial property, and heavy construction sectors.
Costs and prices
Labour costs
The annual rate of growth in labour costs per employee hadremained subdued, and had edged lower for services ( Chart 5 ).
Pressures on wage inflation had been muted and in somecases were reported to have decreased as the effect of lowerCPI inflation relative to a year earlier had started to feed4

through, and because of weak profitability.  Bonuses and
overtime payments were generally flat or lower than a yearearlier and there continued to be a significant minority ofemployees on pay freezes.  There were, however, some furtherreports of skills shortages in IT and engineering, puttingupward pressure on pay in those specialisms.  Pension costswere reported to be increasing, in part reflectingauto-enrolment, although the costs of that would vary acrossbusinesses depending on their employees’ opt-out rates.Increased contributions to cover deficits on legacy liabilities indefined benefit pension schemes were said to be raisingpension costs for some, though that was rarely reported to beaffecting companies’ wage setting.
Non-labour costs
The rate of inflation was unchanged for materials costs,remaining modest, though had edged higher for importedfinished goods.  For many contacts, cost increases continuedto be driven by the direct and indirect effects of increases inenergy and agricultural commodity prices.  However, someeasing of other cost pressures was reported recently, with oilprices having fallen back and the prices of some non-specialistmetals — such as steel — said to be lower than a year earlier,albeit offset a little by the depreciation of sterling.  Importedfinished goods price inflation was reported to have edged up,as the effects of sterling’s recent depreciation had started to befelt.  On the assumption that sterling remained at currentlevels, some further pickup in import price inflation wasexpected by contacts as the year progressed.
Output prices and margins
Manufacturers’ and business services’ output price inflationhad edged higher, though was still subdued.  Manufacturersreported some pass-through of cost increases, albeit often
only partial.  For some exporters, however, stronger demandand sterling depreciation had allowed for some increase inexport prices, and some niche manufacturers also reported aslight increase in pricing power.  That, combined withefficiency improvements and moves by some to a moreprofitable product mix, was reported to have slightly improvedmanufacturing margins.  For services, a strengthening indemand over recent months had allowed a slightly greaterpass through of cost increases.  Profitability in the sectoroverall was reported to be flat.
Consumer prices
The annual rate of consumer price inflation had remainedunchanged for both goods and services.  Contacts expectedfood and beverage price inflation to continue at current levelsor to increase further over the coming months as supply-chainpressures fed through.  For consumer goods, some upwardsprice pressures were also expected through the year ascurrency hedges on imported goods unwound.  However,some of those effects were expected to be tempered by strongdiscounting of clothing and footwear during the summer sales,as retailers attempted to clear stocks of spring clothing unsoldbecause of poor weather.  And the heavy discounting on newcar sales was reported to have continued, partly reflectingEuropean producers targeting UK sales in the face of weakdemand on the continent.  Elsewhere, inflation was seen asremaining largely concentrated in administered and regulatedprices, including in energy, where further price rises wereexpected during the year and concerns about capacitypersisted.  More generally, the high price-sensitivity ofconsumers was seen as restraining companies from passingthrough price rises in both goods and services sectors.Agents’ survey on exports
As a box in the February 2013 Inflation Report discussed,
UK export performance over recent years has beendisappointing given sterling’s depreciation and a recovery inworld trade.  In April, the Agents conducted a survey ofbusiness contacts to ask how the value of their UK exports hadchanged over the past year and their expectations for the nextyear.  Firms were also asked to indicate how a range of factorshad affected exports and about significant obstacles that wereconstraining exports.  284 companies participated, including70 services firms, with export destinations that were broadlyrepresentative of UK trade patterns.  The results were weightedby export revenues. 
A net balance of respondent firms reported a modest increase
in export values over the past year, and expectations of growthwere similar for the next twelve months ( Chart A ).
Among firms whose main export market was the
United States, there was a lower balance of firms expectingexport growth in the coming year compared with the balancefor the past year.  Firms principally exporting to other marketsgenerally expected stronger growth in the next year.  Moregenerally, goods exporters’ expectations for the next year weresimilar to the past year, while services firms expected growthto be slightly stronger.
Looking at the drivers of export values, export prices were
reported to have had little impact over the past year,suggesting that the reported rise in values largely reflectedhigher volumes.  Taken together, overseas demand andexchange rate movements had driven much of the reportedgrowth over the past year ( Chart B ).  Market share gains and
the relative competitiveness of UK exports were also helpingto boost export revenues for many respondents.  For thecoming year, the positive effect of overseas demand and
exchange rate movements on export values was expected toincrease, while the impetus from cost competitiveness wasexpected to wane slightly.
Contacts were also asked about the main factors holding back
exports.  A lack of overseas demand, the use of local offices orproduction and high costs of market entry were cited mostfrequently by contacts ( Chart C ), while regulatory or legal
concerns and capacity or skills constraints were also material.Looking across export destinations, overseas demand wasmost commonly cited as an obstacle by firms exporting mainlyto the euro area.  Access to trade finance was more of an issuefor exporters to the euro area and the Middle East than othermarkets.
There were some notable differences in responses across firm
size.  Large firms were much more likely to make use of localoffices or production, rather than exporting directly from theUnited Kingdom.  Smaller exporters in contrast cited their lackof effective sales networks overseas and cost competitivenessas more significant issues.  The availability of finance was muchmore likely to be an issue for smaller firms.
