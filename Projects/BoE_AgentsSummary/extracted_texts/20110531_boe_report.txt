May 2011Demand
Consumption
There had been a further weakening in consumer demand
(Chart 1 ).  Consumers remained focused on obtaining value for
money and increasingly required promotions to induce themto spend.  And discount retailers continued to benefit fromconsumers ‘trading down’ at the expense of mid-rangeproducts.  Some contacts observed signs that spendingpatterns based around paydays had become moreaccentuated.  Shoppers were also making smaller, morefrequent purchases.  And more households were choosing topay by cash rather than credit, to help them stay within a fixedbudget.  The top end of the retail sector continued to showsome resilience, although there were reports of increased useof discounting there too.
Demand for consumer services had also softened ( Chart 1 ).
While nominal spending on non-discretionary services, such ascar insurance, had increased somewhat, often due to risingprices, spending on discretionary services had been squeezed.There had been a fall in spending per person on a range ofrecreational activities.  And promotions were still consideredessential for many service providers to generate demand.Holiday bookings had strengthened a little compared to lastyear, but holidaymakers were increasingly opting forall-inclusive packages, to keep better control of costs.
Housing market
Demand had weakened further, reflecting concerns that houseprices might begin to fall more quickly, and households’uncertainty about earnings.  At the lower end of the market,many would-be first-time buyers were still struggling to save adeposit, with an increasing number of transactions involvingsome form of shared equity.  The middle and upper segmentsof the market had been faring a little better, helped in part bygreater use of house-builders’ part-exchange schemes,although these programmes were expected to become morelimited due to constraints on builders’ balance sheets.  Buy-to-let investors remained active buyers, particularly for
smaller properties favoured by frustrated first-time buyers.
Business investment
Spending on capital was expected to continue to grow at areasonable pace over the coming year ( Chart 2 ).  Investment
was typically to help find efficiencies, although such plansoften had the ancillary benefit of raising potential productivecapacity.  And some exporters were actively investing inadditional capacity.  Firms were also investing in new productsto try to exploit growth markets both at home and abroad.The deterioration in the outlook for household spending hadled some firms to reassess their investment plans.
Investment intentions among services contacts pointed to a
somewhat more moderate pace of growth than inmanufacturing, reflecting the relatively larger degree of sparecapacity in the sector.  Firms continued to invest in measuresto lower costs, for instance on alternative sources of energy ormore efficient distribution facilities, and in IT to raiseproductivity.  Resumption of routine investment that had beenon hold was also helping to support spending.  Someconsumer-facing firms had become more cautious in theirplans, with food retailers slowing the pace of store expansionprogrammes.
Exports
Exports of goods had grown rapidly over the past twelvemonths, due to the strength of demand in both emergingmarkets and some developed markets, including Germany andthe United States ( Chart 3 ).  The pace of export growth
relative to domestic demand had led some firms to shift theirfocus overseas, and some had been successful in penetratingnew markets or winning a greater share of existing ones.  Theaerospace, automotive, energy and infrastructure sectors wereall sources of particularly solid growth.  Some services firms inthese sectors, as well as in legal and accountancy work, hadalso reported a pickup in foreign demand.  So far, the impact ofcivil unrest in the Middle East and North Africa had not hadmuch impact on exports.2

Output
Business services
Turnover in professional and financial services continued to
grow at a modest pace.  That reflected positive growth indemand from the private sector, while public sector workcontinued to decline.  Accountancy and legal firms reported asmall improvement in activity, particularly for clients thatserved overseas markets.  Corporate finance had strengtheneda little, due to a rise in mergers and acquisitions activity.  Andnew office lettings were on the rise.  Advertising companieshad seen a steady decline in the use of traditional media, butwork for on-line campaigns was providing some offset.  This,along with firms’ ongoing efforts to find efficiencies, was alsohelping some IT companies.
Among other business services, the gradual recovery in
turnover continued.  That was partly due to success in pushingthrough price increases.  Hauliers and transport providers, forinstance, had been able to pass on some of the recent rises infuel prices.  But they had also benefited from rising activity inthe manufacturing sector.  Revenues from the public sectorhad declined significantly, although some hoped that therewould be an increase in outsourcing work in the future.
Manufacturing
The manufacturing sector continued to grow at a steady pace(Chart 3 ).  Suppliers of intermediate and capital goods to the
export sector reported that conditions had improved further.And there was also some growth in the supply of investmentgoods to domestic firms, reflecting their efforts to findefficiencies.  Producers of consumer goods for the homemarket tended to report that activity was growing fairly slowly,and some noted that conditions had deteriorated in recentmonths.  Firms exposed to the public sector also reported thatgovernment orders continued to fall.
Following the disaster in Japan, some car manufacturers had
announced plans for significant, temporary, cutbacks in output,due to expected shortages of some components.  Because oflags in the supply chain, which sometimes extended for a
number of months, further material disruption to productionwas anticipated during the second quarter, and perhapsbeyond.  For firms in other sectors, the impact of events inJapan had so far been small.  But many contacts felt poorlysighted on the origins of some imported electrical components.Given lags in their respective supply chains, there was a riskthat shortages of some inputs could yet become apparent overthe coming months.  The extra bank holiday for the royalwedding in April was expected to cause some additionalvolatility in production.
Construction
Overall, activity in the construction sector over the past threemonths was thought to be broadly in line with that a yearearlier.  The level of output continued to be supported by workon infrastructure and energy projects, along with officebuilding in London.  And there had also been a small pickup inresidential housing construction.  The slowing pace of openingsof new stores by some large retailers was weighing on thegrowth rate of construction output, but this was offset byincreased work on warehousing and distribution centres.  Manycontacts reported a fall in public sector work, and there wasexpected to be a more marked drag on output from lowergovernment spending from 2012 onward.
Credit conditions
Large firms, and profitable businesses with relatively littleoutstanding debt, tended to report that they had access tocredit if required.  A few small and medium-sized enterprisesalso reported that loan terms had become a little morefavourable.  But most did not perceive a material improvementin conditions.  In some cases this was expected to restrictgrowth plans, while some firms expressed concerns about thelack of availability of funds for working capital.  A few contactsdid note that there had been a pickup in marketing activity bylenders.  But some banks themselves commented that lendersmight be focusing their attentions on the same, low-risk,borrowers.  New lending to firms in property-related sectorsremained scarce.
Employment
In services, employment intentions reflected differences inactivity across sub-sectors.  Business services companiesplanned to increase headcount at a gradual pace, in line withthe gentle recovery in corporate demand.  Employmentintentions among firms serving the public sector were typicallyweaker than for those facing the private sector.  Firmsoperating in the construction industry generally anticipatedflat or declining employment over the coming year.  And therehad been a further dip in intentions among retailers andconsumer services firms, reflecting rising uncertainty about theoutlook for household spending.

–Chart 3 Manufacturing outputContacts in the manufacturing sector expected employment
to continue to grow at a steady pace, particularly among firmsexposed to foreign demand.  Intentions among suppliers ofmanufactured goods for the domestic market were oftenrather weaker.  Recruitment was generally reported to be fairlyeasy for low-skilled positions.  But in both manufacturing andservices, for instance among engineering and IT companies,and in risk management and compliance, there were risinginstances of skill shortages.
Capacity utilisation
Manufacturers were operating with levels of spare capacitythat were reported to be broadly normal.  That was in part dueto rising demand, particularly for exports.  But it was also afunction of steps taken by firms to lower productive potentialin response to the sharp decline in activity during therecession, for instance, by reducing the number of shifts, ormothballing capital.  However, contacts were often reluctantto reverse measures that had been implemented only on atemporary basis, given the often significant costs of doing soand uncertainties about the durability of the recovery.  
In the service sector, most firms reported that they had
significant amounts of spare capacity.  This was falling slowlyfor those business services firms that were benefiting fromrising private sector activity.  Firms serving the consumer andpublic sectors often still had substantial amounts of slack, andsome were revising down their plans for headcount to keepspare capacity from growing.
Costs and prices
Labour costs
Labour costs were rising at a moderate pace in bothmanufacturing and services.  Settlements were typicallyreported to be between 2%–3%, slightly higher than a yearearlier, reflecting rising profitability over the past twelvemonths.  Above-inflation settlements were rare, and in someinstances employees were entering a third year of pay freezes.Negotiations over pay with unions were generally reported tohave gone smoothly.  The additional bank holiday associatedwith the royal wedding in April was expected to generate atemporary increase in labour costs for some firms.
Non-labour costs
Contacts continued to face rapid increases in the prices of arange of raw materials ( Chart 4 ).  These included
commodities, metals, energy and oil-based products.  Anumber of firms were experiencing sharp increases in costs dueto the expiry of long-term contracts made prior to the latestsurge in prices.  The rising cost of raw materials was feedingthrough to various processed inputs.  Together with risingwages in Asia and higher transport costs, the increase in thecost of raw materials was putting upward pressure on the priceof imports of finished goods.Output prices
Manufacturing output prices were rising at a moderate pace(Chart 4 ).  Firms had managed to pass on some of the increase
in input costs, particularly in markets where demand wasstrengthening, or when inputs that had risen sharply in pricecomprised a large proportion of the cost base.  But even then,pass-through of higher costs was typically only partial, andoften with a substantial lag.  Some firms were now repricingoutput more frequently, to try to pass on increases in costsmore quickly.  But many contacts felt that they had littlepricing power, and the squeeze on margins was forcing them tofocus increasingly on measures to reduce costs, such asconsolidating back-office functions across different worksites.
Overall, business services price inflation remained subdued.
Spare capacity in much of the sector continued to keep feesfrom rising, particularly in construction-related services, andamong providers of professional and financial services of astandardised nature.  Suppliers of some niche services hadbeen able to raise their prices, however, due to rising demand.And some firms in the haulage and transport sectors hadmanaged to pass on some of the increase in fuel costs, oftenthrough the use of escalator clauses in contracts.
Consumer prices
According to contacts, the pace of retail price inflationremained elevated.  That reflected a combination of the rise inVAT, an increase in transport costs and the rising cost ofimported finished goods.  But while list prices were rising quitequickly, contacts reported that the weakness of consumerdemand meant that discounting was much heavier than wouldtypically be expected for this time of year.
Consumer services price inflation had also been boosted by
pass-through of the increase in VAT.  And the prices of essentialservices, including rents and car insurance, continued to risefairly rapidly.  Higher fuel costs had also been passed on, atleast in part, in the price of travel and public transport.  Butthere remained considerable downward pressure on the priceof discretionary services, reflecting the weakness of demand.4
