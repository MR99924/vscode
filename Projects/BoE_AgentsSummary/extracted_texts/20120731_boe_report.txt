July 2012Demand
Consumption
There had been a slowing in the growth rate of spending on
retail goods and services, in part due to lower inflation.Contacts also thought that there had been a dip in consumerconfidence due to worries about the economic outlook.  Thepattern of demand continued to be highly changeable, andinfluenced considerably by the weather and the timing ofcultural and sporting events.  For instance, a brief spell of fineweather in late May had temporarily boosted demand forseasonal goods, such as summer fashions, but had been offsetby dreary conditions in June, and an overhang of stock had ledsome stores to begin mid-year sales early.  Meanwhile, theDiamond Jubilee was reported to have provided a short-termboost to food sales.  Households were becoming ever morefocused on obtaining value for money, and as well as tradingdown to cheaper products, were increasingly switching awayfrom fresh goods to dried and frozen products, to minimisewaste.
Housing market
There had been further signs of weakening in the housingmarket.  Some contacts thought that the drop-off in activitywas, in part, the consequence of transactions having beenbrought forward ahead of the end of relief on stamp duty inMarch.  More generally, buyers were reported to have becomemore cautious in light of uncertainty about events in the euroarea.  In addition, there had been the added distractions of theDiamond Jubilee and Euro 2012, which were likely to havecaused some prospective buyers to postpone enquiries in theshort term.  But supporting the level of activity, buy-to-letinvestment continued to grow, and foreign investors hadbranched out of commercial property in the capital and begunalso to invest in the London residential lettings market.  Therehad also been further reports of downsizing by olderhomeowners in order to release equity.  Vendors continued toshow a more realistic attitude towards pricing, and there was agrowing trend among homeowners to sell via auction.  
Business investment
Investment intentions remained positive but had softened alittle ( Chart 1 ).  And there was a general sense of stepping back
from expansion plans, due to concerns about the prospects fordemand going forward.  That was particularly true of firmssupplying the domestic market.  For example, some of thelarge retailers had pared back their expansion plans, givenrevised expectations for household expenditure.  But evenamong exporters, while some were still investing in capacity,for others, slowing growth abroad had lessened the urgencyfor further expansion.  Nevertheless, firms were still keeping upwith essential spending on replacement kit and repair andmaintenance, and continued to invest in finding efficienciesand improving management information.  The need to complywith regulatory change was also motivating capital spending in
some sectors.  For instance, lower emissions targets had ledsome hauliers to invest in their fleets.
Exports
Export growth remained strong but had slowed further on themonth ( Chart 2 ), in large part due to weaker demand in the
euro area.  That was apparent both in those countriesstruggling with sovereign debt issues and increasingly in thosethat were not, such as Germany and France.  There were alsosome reports of a softening in exports to China, although, forthe most part, growth in emerging market economiesremained strong.  Demand growth in the United States hadalso fallen back.  The aerospace and automotive sectorscontinued to represent some of the most robust sources ofgrowth, but were now showing signs of a slackening in thepace of expansion.  Reports of losses of competitiveness due tothe appreciation of the pound remained rare, although somebusinesses had lowered their sterling prices to offset it andthere were concerns about the prospect of any further rise inthe exchange rate.2

Output
Business services
Activity across the service sector as a whole was broadly flat
compared with a year earlier, although some firms weregaining market share as competitors exited the industry.  Andwhile some sectors were struggling, others were benefitingfrom weakness in the wider economy.  For instance, the ITindustry continued to grow as a result of the efforts of alltypes of business to reduce labour costs and go online.Accountants reported that advisory work on restructuringcontinued to support activity, as corporates soughtalternatives to insolvency.  And contacts in the legalprofession had seen a switch from litigation to disputeresolution, as a cheaper means of settling corporatedisagreements.  In contrast, growth in business travel,conferencing and corporate hospitality had softened, asfirms once again pared back non-essential spending.  Andmany contacts in logistics had registered a slowing in bothdomestic and export related work.
Manufacturing
Manufacturing output growth had weakened somewhat(Chart 2 ), after having picked up during the spring.  That was
mainly down to the slowing in export growth, which wasfeeding its way through the domestic supply chain.  It was alsoa result of both falling public sector spending, and a decline indemand for capital goods, consistent with weaker investmentintentions in the wider economy.  Output of consumer goodswas reported to be fairly flat compared with a year earlier,although there was some hope that food and drink productionwould receive a fillip from the Olympics.  For a few contacts,which had been operating at full capacity, the extra bankholiday due to the Diamond Jubilee had caused a significantreduction in output.  But for most, the effect had been modest,and many of those affected expected to be able to recover thelost output in the near term.
Construction
There had been a further decline in output compared with ayear earlier, in part due to very wet weather, which had haltedwork on some sites.  But it was mainly due to underlyingweakness in public sector spending, and there had been anoticeable pickup in project deferrals.  Meanwhile, privatesector activity continued to be supported by a small rise inhouse building and the construction of studentaccommodation.  And there was some growth from work onenergy and transport infrastructure.  But commercial propertydevelopment remained very weak, with significant overhangsof office and, increasingly, retail space, in much of the country.And some of the large retailers had cut back their plans fornew store openings.  Small regional construction companiesnoted a further step-up in competition from national players,as their remaining large projects came to completion.Credit conditions
Contacts continued to report that fees and rates were risingwhen facilities came to be renewed, while some firms hadbeen discouraged from applying for new borrowing in the firstplace.  Lenders had been making progress at working throughtheir portfolios of past commercial property lending andidentifying breaches of covenants.  And there had been a rise ininstances of banks showing less forbearance onnon-performing loans, sometimes encouraging borrowers torefinance elsewhere.  Small firms were still often struggling tosecure loans, although asset-backed forms of borrowing werereported to be fairly readily available.  In contrast, largerbusinesses often had favourable access to credit, butfrequently had little appetite to borrow, preferring instead topay down existing debt, or use internal sources to fundinvestment.  The general sense from contacts was that, so far,there had been little impact on lending from the National LoanGuarantee Scheme.
Employment
Private sector employers did not expect much change in staffnumbers over the next six months, and there were frequentreports of low levels of churn in the labour market.  Inmanufacturing, some exporters continued to take onadditional employees, and concerns about future skillsshortages were encouraging a growing number of businessesto create apprenticeships.  But slowing demand had led somecompanies to scale back their recruitment plans.  For manybusinesses, especially those facing the home market, anygrowth in output in the near term could be met using existingresources.  In business services, in areas of growth, such as ITand engineering, contacts anticipated further job creation overthe rest of the year.  And some firms reported that it wasdifficult to recruit for certain specialist roles.  In contrast,ongoing consolidation in those sectors where there was stillconsiderable spare capacity, such as law and construction, wasexpected to lead to further job losses.
Capacity utilisation
There was a small margin of spare capacity in themanufacturing sector ( Chart 3 ), in part due to past investment
and hiring, but also due to slowing in the pace of outputgrowth.  Exporters tended to exhibit the least slack and wereoccasionally constrained by the lack of appropriately skilledstaff.  Firms facing the domestic market typically had rathermore spare capacity.  The weaker recovery in the service sectormeant that there was still a degree of underutilised labour andcapital ( Chart 3 ), although consolidation through mergers and
firm exits had eroded some of that slack.  In growth areas, suchas IT, businesses sometimes had little or no scope to take onnew work.  In retail, many businesses were already atminimum staffing levels, and were now considering closing
stores, or reducing operating hours to try to raise productivity.Others were reducing staff numbers by introducing automatedcheckouts or better matching working hours to peak tradingperiods.
Costs and prices
Labour costs continued to grow at a moderate pace ( Chart 4 ),
with slightly more upward pressure in manufacturing thanservices, due to the sector’s relatively stronger performanceover the past year.  But across industries there had beenreports of a slowing in pay growth in recent months, withconcerns about the outlook leading some employers to defermaking awards until later in the year.  Moreover, firms wereincreasingly linking basic pay to the performance of thebusiness, rather than inflation, and were making greater useof individual pay awards and bonuses over across-the-boardsettlements.  Employees tended to remain broadly acceptingof such measures.  Although, where staff had been onextended pay freezes, increases in the National MinimumWage had eroded pay differentials, and that was forcing a fewemployers to consider raising wages for all staff in order topreserve distinct pay scales.
Non-labour costs
Materials cost inflation continued to ease, with the prices ofvarious commodities having levelled off, or even fallen —significantly in some cases.  But past increases in energy priceswere still pushing up on costs, sometimes markedly, forbusinesses renewing long-term contracts.  Import priceinflation had slowed somewhat, due to lessening upwardpressure from input costs.  And the rise in sterling had loweredthe price of imports from the euro area for some companies.But offsetting that was a combination of rising wages inemerging market economies, along with a fairly sharp increasein shipping costs.Output prices
Manufacturing output price inflation continued to slowgradually, as upward pressure from input costs began to wane.But some firms continued to try to pass on past increases incosts, or were hanging on to reductions in costs to rebuild lostmargins.  There was very little upward pressure on the price ofbusiness services, although there were differences betweensectors.  Some growth areas and specialist services had beenable to raise prices, while fees for standardised services, and insectors with significant spare capacity, continued to besqueezed.
Consumer prices
Consumer price inflation had slowed a little further on themonth.  The cost of petrol and the prices of various basicfoodstuffs had fallen a little from recent highs, and the rise insterling had lowered the price of some imported finishedgoods.  A number of retailers had also started their summersales earlier than usual, as poor weather had left them with asurplus of stock of seasonal products.  In consumer services,links with official measures of inflation had pushed up theprices of transport and social housing, and postal charges hadalso risen.  But the prices of a range of other services, such ashotel accommodation, visitor attractions, and car servicing,were rising only gradually due to the weakness of consumerdemand.4

To try to assess possible risks to inflation from firms’ efforts to
raise profitability, the agents conducted a survey to investigatecorporate profit margins, where profit margin is defined asoperating profit as a proportion of turnover.  The agents askedfirms how current margins compared with normal, how theyhad changed over the past year, and expectations for thecoming year.  555 firms responded to the survey, with turnoverof £53 billion.
Weighting the results by turnover, around two thirds of firms
reported that margins were currently below normal, wherenormal is defined as the pre-recession average ( Chart A ).  That
was the case across all sectors, with the biggest squeezeevident in construction ( Chart B ).  Margins were also
significantly below normal in retail and business services.  Incontrast with surveys in 2010 and 2011, however, which foundthat exporters’ margins were above normal, the latest surveyfound that they were now somewhat below normal.In terms of changes over the past year, the survey found that
there had been a modest fall in margins overall ( Chart C ).  On
balance, contacts expected margins to be more or lessunchanged over the coming year.
But behind the aggregate numbers there was considerable
variation between sectors.  For instance, in construction,margins had fallen markedly over the past year, and wereexpected to be squeezed further still in the year ahead.  But inretail, businesses reported a small improvement in margins overthe past year, with another increase expected in the comingyear.  Rather than coming through prices, however, thatimprovement was typically expected to come through factorssuch as gains in volumes arising from consolidation in the sector,changes in the mix of products, and growth in internet sales.
Among those respondents that reported that margins were
currently below normal, the majority expected it to takebetween one to three years for them to return to normal(Chart D ).  However, a significant proportion of businesses felt
that the outlook was too uncertain to say when margins mightnormalise, and some believed that profit margins would neverreturn to pre-recession averages.
