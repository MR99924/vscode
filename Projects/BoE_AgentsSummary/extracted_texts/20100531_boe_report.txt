May 2010Demand
Consumption
The Agents reported that both retail sales and consumer
services turnover remained higher than a year earlier ( Chart 1 ).
Extracting the underlying trend in sales in recent monthsremained extremely difficult, however, due to:  weak year-agocomparators;  the restoration of the standard rate of VAT inJanuary 2010;  changes in the pattern of discounting;  theinclement weather early this year;  and the timing of Easter(which fell earlier in 2010 than in 2009).  Looking throughthese factors, the Agents’ sense was that retail sales growth,which had been slowing from the rates experienced towardsthe end of 2009, had stabilised, and that consumer servicesturnover had been broadly flat in recent months.  
Looking ahead, retailers remained concerned about the
outlook for households’ disposable incomes, given therenewed rise in the prices of some essentials such as petrol,and the possibility of further tax increases and reductions inemployment (particularly in the public sector).
Housing market
Contacts reported that the supply of secondary marketproperties for sale continued to increase.  But restrictions onthe availability of mortgage finance had continued to suppressthe effective demand for houses, particularly among first-timebuyers.  Together, these developments had led to a furtherreduction in the imbalance between excess demand andinsufficient supply that had opened up during 2009 in thehousing market.  As a result, contacts thought that houseprices, which had picked up in late 2009 and early 2010, hadremained little changed in recent months.  
Business investment
Contacts remained cautious about increasing investmentspending ( Chart 2 ), primarily due to uncertainty about future
demand and, for some, the tightness of credit conditions.Nonetheless, there were occasional reports of businessesplanning to invest more in the year ahead.  Those spending
plans mainly reflected the resumption of deferredmaintenance work, projects aimed at delivering lower costs, orthose which would yield a rapid return.  Few companiesplanned to invest in additional capacity, given the significantmargin of slack within businesses.  
Overseas trade
Contacts reported that both export and import volumes hadpicked up in recent months.  But the pace of the recovery inexports had been constrained by weak demand in the United Kingdom’s largest trading partners, and the fact thatmany exporters continued to use sterling’s depreciation toboost their margins, rather than to increase their market share.On imports, there remained only limited signs of significantexpenditure switching, which contacts largely attributed to alack of suitable domestic alternatives.
Output
Business services
The level of business services turnover remained subdued,although the gradual recovery that had emerged over the pastfew months had continued ( Chart 3 ), and become more
widespread.  There had been modest increases in M&A andcorporate finance activity, demand for accountancy, litigationand advertising, as well as a rise in prime commercial propertyinvestment transactions.  Insolvency work had also risen, albeitby less than many had expected.  
The recovery in other business services turnover, while also
apparent ( Chart 3 ), had been much patchier, as businesses
continued to manage overheads tightly.  That said, turnover inthe transport and haulage sector had risen (in part reflectingincreases in fuel and freight costs), notwithstanding anyshort-run disruption caused by the volcanic ash cloud.Spending on corporate travel and entertainment had passedits trough, and there were some tentative signs that corporatehotel bookings had also begun to rise.2

Manufacturing
Manufacturing output had continued to rise gradually.  The
recovery had been driven primarily by increased exportdemand, although output for the domestic market alsoappeared to have risen.  The rise in output had been quite wellspread across industries, with the exception of thosemanufacturers supplying the construction sector, whereactivity remained very weak.  But even in that sector, therewere sporadic signs that output had reached its trough overthe past month or so.
Construction
Output in the construction sector had begun to stabilise,following significant falls over much of the past two years.New homebuilding had picked up, and repair and maintenanceactivity had continued, in part reflecting the impact of theinclement weather earlier in the year.  These developmentshad, however, been offset by weakness in commercialconstruction, where the significant oversupply of propertiesand limited credit availability had continued to discourage newprojects.  Looking ahead, contacts remained concerned aboutthe impact of the forthcoming fiscal consolidation, given theextensive support that public projects had provided to theindustry over the past year.
Credit conditions
Credit conditions remained tight, although the gentleimprovement in the availability of credit, evident for much ofthe past six months, had continued, and spreads on newfacilities had narrowed slightly.  Nonetheless, experiencesremained diverse — smaller businesses and those perceived tobe more risky had benefited much less from the gradualincrease in credit availability than their larger or less riskycounterparts.  And some companies operating in the propertyand construction sectors continued to report particulardifficulty accessing bank finance.The availability of trade credit insurance had continued to
improve, although the low level of cover available, coupledwith the gentle recovery in demand, had forced somebusinesses to take risk onto their own books.  But for manycompanies, bad debts remained under control, and any risehad been smaller than expected at the start of the year.  Therehad even been a few reports of reductions in the incidence ofbad debts in recent months.
Demand for bank credit remained weak.  Many businesses had
continued to pay back bank debt, and others had been buildingup buffers of cash, in advance of maturing bank liabilities or incase of future adverse economic developments.
Employment
The outlook for private sector manufacturing and servicesemployment had remained broadly stable ( Chart 4 ), but there
were a few signs of selective intentions to recruit in somesectors.  For example, some companies in the business servicessector had reinstated trainee and graduate recruitmentschemes to cope with an expected increase in demand.  Theexpected stability in much of the private sector, however,contrasted with the expected reductions in headcount in thepublic sector.  
Capacity utilisation
There remained a significant margin of spare capacity withinbusinesses.  Although incremental increases in demand had ledto a gradual increase in capacity (mainly labour) utilisation(Chart 4 ), most businesses believed that, were demand to
recover rapidly, they could increase output easily withoutadditional capital or labour.  Moreover, the majority thoughtthat, should the need arise, they would experience littledifficulty increasing recruitment, given the deep pool ofavailable labour. Chart 3 Services output

Labour costs
Labour costs remained muted, with the majority of contacts
either freezing pay or making small positive pay awards.  Therehad, however, been some tentative signs that pay growth hadedged higher — the proportion of contacts freezing pay waslower than reported in 2009, and more contacts had madesmall positive awards in order to reward improved profitability,to recognise employees’ loyalty or to boost morale.  Lookingahead, the significant degree of labour market slack wasexpected to keep pay growth contained, although a fewcontacts acknowledged possible upside risks should inflationremain elevated or from the prospective increase in thenational minimum wage later this year.
Total labour costs had picked up by slightly more than pay
settlements.  In part, that reflected the restoration of full-timeworking, higher commission payments in the business servicessector and, in a few instances, the reintroduction of overtime.But it also reflected higher pension fund contributions amongthose companies with significant deficits.   
Non-labour costs
Raw materials prices continued to rise, leading to a furtherincrease in the Agents’ scores, although these remained wellbelow their peaks during 2008 ( Chart 5 ).  The pickup in prices
over the past six months had primarily reflected a rise indemand from emerging economies, but some prices had alsobeen pushed up following a reduction in global capacity duringthe recession.  Contacts reported higher prices for steel,plastics and oil derivatives, paper and timber.  In addition, thehigher cost of fuel had, through an increase in the prevalenceof fuel surcharges, contributed to a rise in freight and transportcosts.  Moreover, a number of contacts had either alreadyfaced or were expecting to face significant increases inbusiness rates, which would further increase their overall costs.  And import prices had also risen, reflecting continuedpass-through of sterling’s depreciation.
Not all costs had risen, however.  Wholesale food prices had
stabilised, or even begun to fall a little.  Many businesses hadrenegotiated expiring energy contracts in recent months,
resulting in a reduction in their utility bills.  And the excesssupply of commercial premises had encouraged landlordseither to reduce headline rents or offer larger incentives (eg rent-free periods) to businesses, in order to prevent vacantlots.
Output prices
Although some businesses had been able to pass on costincreases via escalator clauses in customer contracts, theAgents’ overall sense was that output prices remained underdownward pressure.  For example, services prices hadcontinued to fall (although the pace of deflation had eased inrecent months), as had prices in the construction sector, wherefirms continued to compete fiercely for a limited quantity ofwork.  Overall, contacts continued to report little pricingpower and, given the difficulty associated with raising prices,the majority expected higher costs to eat into profit margins.  
Consumer prices
The Agents reported that retail prices continued to be boostedby the reintroduction of the standard rate of VAT, import pricesand, to a lesser extent, fuel prices (via both petrol prices andhigher transport and haulage costs).  But the rate of inflation,which had stabilised last month, was thought to have beenlittle changed again in April.4
