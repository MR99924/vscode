May 2012Demand
Consumption
Consumer demand had grown a little in recent months 
(Chart 1 ).  That was partly due to warm weather early in the
spring, supporting sales of clothing and garden furniture, forinstance.  And there had been a slight pickup in spending inhousehold goods, including carpets and cupboards, possiblyrelated to an increase in activity in the housing market.  Therehad also been a sharp rise in private car registrations, thoughtto be related to a number of factors, including growingdemand for small, fuel-efficient vehicles, and improvedavailability of finance.  Spending on food remained resilient.Demand for consumer services was growing at a slower ratethan for goods, but there had been an increase in demand fortourism and leisure activities.
Despite some signs of improvement, however, for many
contacts in retail goods and services the environmentremained difficult.  Shoppers were still focused on obtainingvalue for money, and discounting was vital to drive volumegrowth.  There had been an ongoing weakening in brandloyalty, with consumers often visiting several stores to find thelowest price.  And online retail continued to gain market shareat the expense of the high street, where further insolvencieswere expected.  Some shopping centres reported a rise innumbers of empty premises, and there were concerns that thiscould start a cycle of lower footfall and further closures.Similar worries were expressed about the high street.
Housing market
Activity in the housing market continued to rise.  That wasthought to reflect a number of factors:  a rise in the availabilityof mortgages at high loan-to-values;  passage of time havingallowed some would-be buyers to save up for a deposit;  andthe growing prevalence of financial assistance from familymembers.  Buy-to-let demand also continued to strengthen,although the supply of rental property was now catching upwith demand in some areas.  Vendors were also thought tohave become more realistic about selling prices.Business investment
Private sector investment intentions pointed to further modestincreases in capital spending over the coming year.  In bothmanufacturing and services, investment was often motivatedby the need to replace worn-out equipment, and to findefficiencies, particularly through greater use of IT.  Spending onproduct development also continued apace.  This was oftenused to reduce the quality or quantity of inputs, in order tolower the cost per unit, or to create new products, which couldcommand a higher price.  Some exporters were also increasingcapacity to meet rising foreign demand.  
Across sectors, many firms had put plans on hold towards the
end of 2011, in light of heightened uncertainty about theoutlook.  While some of these projects were now being takenforward, in other cases, contacts had lowered theirexpectations for growth, and revised investment plansdownward accordingly.  And some capital spending remainedon hold in the energy sector while contacts waited for moreinformation on government policy.  
Exports
Goods export growth remained strong, particularly toemerging market economies.  For instance, suppliers ofconstruction materials and equipment were benefiting fromthe growth of the energy sector and infrastructuredevelopment in the Middle East, while producers of luxurygoods were seeing rising demand from Russia and the Far East.Professional services, such as architects and engineeringadvisory companies, also reported strong export growth,reflecting the mix of investment spending overseas.  Andaccountancy and law firms were often involved in corporatetransactions in other countries, due to the widespread use ofUK law abroad.  Across sectors, large and, increasingly, smallerbusinesses, were looking to foreign markets in order to expand.And in some instances, contacts reported that they were nowdeclining relatively low margin work for the domestic market,in favour of more profitable overseas business.
Output
Business services
The rate of growth of turnover in business services hadaccelerated a little in recent months, partly due to an increasein prices.  Cost-cutting efforts across the economy weregenerating demand for the services of outsourcing companies,although providers of some low value-added ancillary services,such as cleaning, had been squeezed as their businesscustomers tried to economise.  Leasing businesses had seenactivity rise as corporates opted to rent equipment rather thanbuy it themselves.  And IT firms continued to benefit fromother businesses’ investment in cost-cutting technology.There had also been a rise in the number of corporatetransactions, and restructuring work, supporting legal andaccountancy services. 2

Manufacturing
Manufacturing output for the domestic market continued to
expand at a moderate pace.  This was often driven by finaldemand from abroad, particularly for firms in the automotive,aerospace, and pharmaceutical supply chains.  Foodmanufacturing remained an area of resilience, with suppliers ofunbranded goods tending to do particularly well.  And therewere also some reports of an improvement in activity fromsuppliers of household and garden products.  Manufacturingfor domestic construction was typically very weak, however,and firms were sometimes reorienting themselves to targetforeign markets.  Suppliers to the public sector also oftenreported that conditions were challenging.
Construction
The Agents’ score for construction output growth indicatedthat there had been a further contraction in activity comparedwith a year earlier, in large part due to declining work for thepublic sector, and small firms were often finding conditionsparticularly difficult.  See the box on page 5 for a discussion ofthe results of a survey conducted by the Agents on recentactivity in the construction sector.  Conditions were typicallybetter in London and the South East, compared with the restof the country, particularly for commercial property.  But therehad been a small improvement in house building across anumber of regions.  Retail refurbishments were also providingsupport to the level of activity, although the rate of new storeopenings had slowed.  Tender prices remained underconsiderable downward pressure, reflecting significant sparecapacity in the industry as a whole, and there had been apickup in insolvencies in the sector.  
Credit conditions
For firms with strong balance sheets, credit was normallyavailable on reasonable terms.  But for some businesses therehad been a rise in the interest rate spreads charged on loansover the past few months, and fees were also reported to have increased.  And it had become harder to secure long-term funding from banks, increasing the frequency ofrenegotiations and attendant charges.  Some firms hadresponded to tighter credit conditions by seeking alternativeforms of finance, from wealthy individuals or institutionalinvestors, such as pension funds.  Other businesses wereactively paying down debt, or were focused on generatingcash, preferring to finance investment internally, rather thanthrough borrowing, even if it tended to slow the pace ofinvestment.  Some smaller firms continued to report that theywere unable to obtain credit at any cost and were seeingoverdrafts withdrawn.  It also remained difficult forconstruction firms to secure credit, and there were suggestionsthat lenders had become more willing to foreclose on non-performing commercial property lending. Employment
Private sector employment was expected to be broadlyunchanged over the next six months ( Chart 2 ).  Manufacturing
firms typically planned to meet future demand growth throughrising productivity.  But some were taking apprentices on toaddress long-standing skills gaps, while further redundancieswere expected among firms supplying goods for domestichouseholds, as persistently weak demand and low marginsspurred further reductions in costs.  In business services,recruitment plans were also flat.  Again, there was a moderateamount of hiring of junior staff under way to accommodategrowth in the medium term.  But some businesses planned tolower headcount, having revised down their expectations forgrowth.  Mergers of small, local, professional and financialservices practices were also expected to lead to some joblosses.  In retail, some larger chains continued to take on staff,but that was expected to be offset by store closures andinsolvencies elsewhere.  Where headcount was rising, that wasoften with a view to create flexibility in the workforce, withtotal hours being held constant overall. 
Capacity utilisation
In manufacturing, capacity utilisation was a little belownormal, with most firms able to meet expected changes indemand comfortably ( Chart 3 ).  Exporters tended to have
rather less slack than firms supplying the domestic market,however, and were sometimes declining UK orders in favour ofhigher margin overseas business.  In the service sector,contacts tended to report relatively higher levels of sparecapacity.  But in growth areas, such as IT, firms often reportedthat they had little spare capacity.  In some industries, such asfood production and haulage, consolidation through mergersand firm exits had removed an element of spare capacity.  Andmore small businesses were expected to close, as the fatiguecaused by persistently difficult trading conditions set in amongowners.  In some services with large fixed assets, businesseswere attempting to reorganise physical capital, for instance by5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4

Costs and prices
Labour costs
Labour cost growth remained fairly modest.  Private sectorsettlements continued to be around 2% or 3%, with awardstending to be a little higher in manufacturing than services.  Inthe construction and retail sectors pay freezes were common,or there had been increases in line with the national minimumwage.  There were generally few signs of upward pressure onpay from staff, except among some unionised workforces.  Andthere were ongoing steps by employers to move away frominflation indexation and across-the-board settlements,towards more performance-based awards, and targetedincreases to retain key skills, while keeping down overall staffcosts.  Employers were also seeking to limit increases in labourcosts in other ways, for instance, by reducing the incrementsfor professional qualification, or removing the premiumattached to overtime.
Non-labour costs
Materials cost inflation remained around its historical average,as the pace of increase in the prices of various commoditieshad slowed.  But the past rise in the price of oil was reported to be feeding through to higher haulage and shipping charges, along with the prices of oil-based materials, andenergy-intensive products.  Import prices had also continuedto rise at a steady pace.  The recent appreciation of sterlinghad lowered the price of imports somewhat, and the cost ofsome electronic components affected by flooding in Thailandhad stabilised.  Offsetting these influences were rapidincreases in wage costs in some emerging market economies.  Output prices
Output prices continued to rise at a moderate pace reflecting some pass-through of increases in costs ( Chart 4 ).  
Pass-through tended to be greatest among suppliers of nichegoods and services, or where contracts included escalatorclauses, which allowed increases in input costs to be passed onto customers.  And there had been a rise in the frequency ofreports of efforts made to protect margins by turning downlower-priced jobs.  For instance, some food producers werenow prepared to lose supermarket business rather thancontinue to participate in promotional activity.  In contrast, forbusinesses selling into sectors where demand was weak itremained difficult to secure price increases.  This was the casefor suppliers of cleaning services, and standardised legal andaccountancy practices, for example.  But some firms weretrying to offset downward pressure on prices by re-engineeringproducts to cut costs.  
Consumer prices
Consumer goods price inflation remained elevated, in part dueto higher fuel prices, along with rising costs of production andincreases in the price of imported finished goods.  And whilediscounting and bundled promotions continued to bewidespread, unit prices were often being marked up.  Inflationin consumer services was also fairly high, in large part due tothe indexation of a number of essential services to measures ofofficial inflation over the past year, for instance in publictransport and social housing rents.  Upward pressure on private rents was thought to be abating, however, as thesupply of rental property picked up, and because demand wasbeginning to be choked off by higher charges in some areas.Non-essential service providers typically had relatively littlepricing power, meanwhile, tending to restrain the pace ofinflation.4

–Three months on the same period a year earlierChart 4 Output price inflationAgents’ survey on construction
According to ONS non seasonally adjusted monthly data,
construction output was very weak during the past winter.  TheAgents conducted a survey to try to get another read on thestrength of activity in the sector.  The survey asked contactsabout changes in output in 2012 Q1 compared with theprevious quarter and the previous year.  And contacts werealso asked about the length of shutdown periods during thewinter months.  152 firms responded, and accounted foraround a fifth of the sector by turnover.
Weighting the results by turnover, around a quarter of
respondents reported that the volume of output in 2012 Q1was flat compared with a quarter earlier, and more companiesreported that output was falling than rising ( Chart A ).  Overall,
a net balance of 10% of firms reported that turnover hadfallen, suggesting that there had been a modest decline inoutput compared with a quarter earlier.  This appeared ratherless weak than the fall in the official data.
When responding to the question about changes in activity in
2012 Q1 compared with the previous year, there was a smallpositive net balance of responses ( Chart A ).  But this was
largely due to house builders, which tended to report muchbetter annual rates of growth than the sample as a whole.Broadly, the survey results suggested that activity had beenflat over the course of the past year.  Again, this indicated thatactivity may have been a little stronger than in the officialdata.
The majority of respondents reported that they normally shut
down for up to a week in both December and January (Chart B ).  That suggested that it might be reasonable toexpect a fairly sizable decline in the level of activity over the
course of the winter.
The vast majority of firms reported that in both 
December 2011 and January 2012, their shutdown periods hadbeen the same as usual ( Chart C ).  Perhaps surprisingly,
however, given the extremely bad weather conditions inDecember 2010, firms reported that the shutdown period thenhad also been the same as usual.  But there may have beenadditional days lost, which the survey did not capture, as itasked only about the ‘normal’ shutdown period.  And itappears that for many firms, while sites remained open duringthe bad weather, much less work could be completed.  Also, atthe time, a few contacts had reported that the bad weathercoincided with the usual shutdown period, so had caused littledisruption.
