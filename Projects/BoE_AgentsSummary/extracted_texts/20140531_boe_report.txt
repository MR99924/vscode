May 2014Demand
Consumption
Annual growth in retail sales values had been little changed,
remaining fairly modest.  Consumers had continued to keep atight rein on day-to-day retail purchases, though recent warmweather had stimulated spending on seasonal lines, such asclothing and footwear and at garden centres.  Demand forhousing-related durable goods, such as furniture andhomeware, had accelerated a little, but less than might havebeen implied by the pace of housing transactions.  Growth ofnew car sales had remained buoyant, with demand stillstimulated by the ready availability of finance leases atrelatively low cost.  Growth in consumer services turnover hadedged higher, remaining somewhat stronger than for retailsales.  Household spending in restaurants, visits to cinemasand other leisure attractions had picked up further.  Spendingon road and rail travel was accelerating, possibly associatedwith increased numbers of commuter journeys as employmenthad risen.  Hotel occupancy rates had also increased.  
Housing market
Housing market transactions had continued to rise strongly ona year earlier.  That had also been reflected in strong demandfor housing-related services such as conveyancing, mortgagesand removals.  But there were concerns among estate agentsabout shortages of stock for sale, as growth in new salesinstructions had lagged demand.  Some contacts had notedthat the implementation of new rules resulting from theMortgage Market Review had appeared to have beenassociated with a tightening of mortgage availability and alengthening of mortgage processing times.  Outside London,activity was often concentrated in low to mid-price brackets,with first-time buyers having benefited from improvedmortgage availability and buy-to-let investors still very activein that segment of the market.  The Help to Buy equity loanscheme had continued to drive new house sales.  
Business investment
Investment intentions had increased ( Chart 1 ), reflecting
growing confidence in the strength of demand and, for somecontacts, an improvement in the availability of finance.  Forsome companies, however, there remained an expectationthat they would seek to increase mergers and acquisitionsactivity rather than capital spending.  In manufacturing,intentions indicated steady investment growth, but weretempered by firms’ abilities to meet current demand withexisting capital — in some cases following heavy investmentsto update equipment and expand capacity over recent years.In services, businesses were increasing investment in IT, withthe aim of raising efficiency and/or improving online sales.Investment in property was picking up, including for someconsumer services firms who were seeking to expand into newcommercial developments and conversions.  This contrastedwith the focus on refurbishment seen over the past year or so.Exports
The value of manufacturing exports had continued to growsteadily.  Sterling’s appreciation had yet to affect volumessignificantly, but had compressed exporters’ profit margins.Demand from the euro area had edged up and sales to theUnited States had continued to improve, offset to someextent by a slowing in demand from some emergingeconomies and from Russia in particular.  Exports growth insectors such as automotive, aerospace, oil and gas, powergeneration and branded consumer goods had remained strong.  But there were areas where goods exports hadweakened, including in defence and healthcare exports to theUnited States.  Services exports had also continued to grow, in part reflecting continuing strength in demand related tomajor infrastructure construction projects in the Middle andFar East, as well as oil and gas activity globally.  Increasinginward investment to the United Kingdom from overseas had increased demand for professional and commercialproperty-related services.

sectors, including business insurance, corporate finance,
banking, legal and accountancy services, recruitment,advertising and marketing agencies.  There had been a furtherrise in commercial real estate activity, weighted towardsLondon and the South East, but with demand for industrialand warehousing space nationally having also risen.  Amongother business services, IT services growth remained robust,driven by investment in new and existing systems, theadditional IT needs arising from employment growth andrising demand for cloud computing.  Outsourcing activityrelated to property, consulting and financial services had risen.Wholesalers and logistics companies reported further steadyrises in turnover, especially among those in the constructionsupply chain.  Business travel had increased.  
Manufacturing
Manufacturing output for the domestic market had continuedto grow at a steady pace ( Chart 2 ), and the pipeline of forward
orders suggested similar growth to come over the next six months.  Output in automotive, aerospace, energy andmedical supply chains had continued to grow.  Constructionproduct manufacturers had seen the strongest growth, withmany brick kilns at full capacity and some capacity that hadbeen mothballed gradually being brought back intoproduction.  Some consumer-facing companies were beingaffected by shifts in household spending patterns away from‘mid-market’ purchases, as well as the potentially adverseimpact on volumes of shifts in food retailers’ discountingpatterns towards ‘single product’ offers rather than ‘multibuy’promotions.  Falls in output on a year earlier were limited to afew manufacturing subsectors, including paper and printingand defence goods. 
Construction
Construction output had continued to grow strongly(Chart 2 ), driven by house building.  The spread of contacts
reporting a strong upturn had become more widespread overrecent months, with builders’ merchants, architects, and evensome smaller construction firms, previously restricted by poorcredit availability, reporting significant growth in activity.Shortages of materials and labour had remained a concern,but were rarely preventing developments from progressing.  Insome cases, planning delays were seen to be a more pressingconstraint on growth in the sector.  The gradual return ofconfidence to the commercial property market had continued,with more contacts talking about prospects for a return ofspeculative development outside London.  Apart from projectsin rail and port infrastructure, large infrastructure schemes hadremained thin on the ground in most areas.  
Credit conditions
Improved business confidence, sustained economic growthand lower bank funding costs had driven furtherimprovements in credit conditions.  Demand for credit hadincreased, though it remained sluggish, especially among smalland medium-sized enterprises, as trust in banking relationships
remained weak.  Large firms typically had the widest choice oflenders, but medium and smaller firms also now had moreoptions.  Funding for real estate development continued toimprove, but lenders were still reluctant to finance speculativedevelopments, especially outside London, and a few lenderswere seeking to run down their commercial and real estateexposures with the aim of strengthening their balance sheets.More generally, existing and challenger banks reportedincreasing competition and non-bank lenders remained active.Banks were more willing to syndicate larger deals and loanmaturities had increased a little.  Non-bank sources of financeremained attractive, especially to larger companies.  Andinfrastructure firms, housing associations and other companieswere taking advantage of attractive bond market rates,especially at longer maturities.  
Employment 
Employment intentions had increased further, particularly in business services ( Chart 3 ).  Much of the growth of
employment was reported to reflect additional capacity, theneed to fill skills gaps to exploit new markets or to addresssuccession issues.  Employment intentions in business serviceshad become increasingly broad-based, consistent with trendsin turnover growth.  Intentions in consumer services overallhad also strengthened on the month, but were more mixedacross subsectors:  discount supermarkets, estate agents andsome hotels, restaurants and visitor attractions had increasedemployment, while companies in insurance and travel serviceshad cut jobs as more spending moved online.  Manufacturingemployment had been rising steadily, especially in automotiveand other transport sectors.  Recruitment difficulties hadremained slightly above normal, due to shortages in a numberof skilled occupations, but with less-skilled labour remainingreadily available across the economy.  The availability of ITexperts, quantity surveyors, real estate professionals andengineers had remained relatively tight, and shortages inconstruction trades such as bricklayers, plasterers andcarpenters were causing problems for construction firms,reflecting the loss of supply over the recession.

Capacity utilisation
Capacity utilisation had remained close to normal, though had
edged a little further above that level in manufacturing.  Ingeneral, labour utilisation was typically higher than that ofcapital assets.  Where spare capacity had largely been used up,most firms were optimistic that expected output growth couldbe met, in the near term, through productivity growth andmodest increases in investment and employment without asharp pickup in costs.  In manufacturing, there was typicallysufficient capital to allow for an increase in output, althoughthis often necessitated an increase in average hours and/oradditional shifts.  In services, the utilisation rate for capitalassets had increased rapidly in recent months, but alsoremained slightly below its historic average.  Capacityconstraints were more marked in construction, where contactshad continued to report shortages of both materials andskilled labour.  
Costs and prices
Labour costs
Growth in total labour costs per employee had edged upfurther, though the rate of increase remained moderate (Chart 4 ).  Wage settlements had continued to be muted,
with the majority remaining in a range of 2% to 3%.  But paygrowth overall had risen, albeit only modestly outsideconstruction, as the number of pay freezes had fallen, the useof targeted defensive awards to retain key people had risen,and as variable pay had increased alongside stronger activity.Those factors had more than offset downward pressures fromrecent falls in inflation, businesses recruiting more junior staff,and reductions in starting salaries.  Labour costs for smallerbusinesses were also rising as auto-enrolment of theiremployees into pension schemes came into effect, with fewreports of companies reducing pay awards to mitigate theimpact of such changes.  Looking ahead, some contacts notedthat the prospective increase in the national minimum wagecould have a wider effect on wages at the lower end of the payspectrum.Non-labour costs
Materials costs and imported finished goods prices hadremained little changed on a year earlier.  Reports of costpressures had remained largely confined to constructionmaterials, where increased costs of bricks, blocks and tileswere widely reported.  Prices of other construction-relatedproducts, such as timber and insulation materials, had alsoincreased over the past few months.  Other commodity prices,including oil and its derivatives had fallen back, and there waslittle evidence yet that issues in Ukraine — a major wheatproducer — were feeding through to higher food priceinflation.  Sterling’s appreciation had depressed both materialcost inflation and imported finished goods inflation overrecent months.  Looking forward, some upside risks werereported, however, notably from the potential effects ofevents in Russia and Ukraine on gas and cereals prices andfrom rising wage costs in Asia.
Output prices and margins
Manufacturing output prices had continued to rise only slowly.Competitive pressures were reported to be limiting manyfirms’ ability to raise prices, although lower input cost inflationhad also reduced the pressure to do so.  Food manufacturersreported ongoing pressure to lower prices in response to theintensification again of supermarket price competition.  Incontrast, manufacturers in the materials supply chain forhouse building reported much stronger inflation as a result ofthe strengthening in housing market activity.  Constructiontender prices had also started to pick up.  Business servicesprice inflation had remained modest.  Inflation was weak insome sectors such as some compliance-related accountancyservices, business travel and distribution.  But for moredifferentiated services or where demand was stronger, such asreal estate transactions and corporate finance, firms’ pricingpower had strengthened slightly.  Both services andmanufacturing profitability had continued to rise modestlyalongside rising activity.  
Consumer prices
Retail goods price inflation had remained subdued.  Restrainedhousehold spending growth, as a result of weak real incomegrowth, was reported to be suppressing goods price inflation.Competition for market share among the supermarkets hadput further downward pressure on the prices of somegroceries.  More generally, retailers had remained verycautious about implementing price increases in response toany rises in costs — often instead maintaining current pricesby introducing new products or re-engineering existing ones.Retail services price inflation had edged lower.  Index-linkedprices had risen more slowly than a year earlier, and falls in oil prices were feeding through to transport and foreignholiday prices.  However, as demand had grown, inflation had risen a little for other discretionary services, such as hotel rooms, restaurant meals, car servicing and privatehealthcare.
