November 2011Demand
Consumption
Nominal spending growth remained very weak.  Contacts
reported that households were budgeting ever more keenly,trading down to avoid overspending, or simply going without,and increasingly deferring expenditure on durable goods untilreplacement became unavoidable.  Consumers’ focus on valuewas apparent in the rising market share of online and discountretail, though even here there were beginning to be signs ofweakening.  Promotions remained essential to drive volumesand keep levels of inventory manageable.  Contactsanticipated that the Christmas period would be broadly flatcompared to last year, and there were rising concerns aboutfuture failures in the sector, if demand fell short of even thesemodest expectations.
The rate of growth of nominal demand for services had edged
down a little further.  Spending on a number ofnon-discretionary services, such as rent and transportation,had been pushed up by price increases.  And that had reducedthe amount of disposable income left over for discretionaryservices.  For example, households were reported to be takingfewer, shorter holidays, and shopping around for the cheapestdeals on hotels and restaurants.  There had been a rise inpassenger numbers on public transport, as higher fuel pricesdiscouraged car use.
Housing market
There had been less of a seasonal pickup in transactions thanusual following the traditional summer lull.  A smallimprovement in mortgage availability had encouraged a fewfirst-time buyers back into the market, along with theGovernment’s FirstBuy initiative and shared equity schemesoffered by some house builders.  But the inability to securecredit continued to constrain many would-be homeowners.That was in turn supporting demand for rental property, andencouraging some buy-to-let investors back to the market.Many existing homeowners were discouraged from trading upby rising uncertainty about future incomes and house prices.Meanwhile, the top end of the market had shown someresilience, with buyers tending to be better able to raisefinance.  And the supply of new homes was increasinglyfocused on meeting the needs of this segment.
Business investment
According to contacts, a further modest increase in capitalspending was planned over the coming year, althoughintentions had softened somewhat since the summer(Chart 1 ).  Across sectors, rising uncertainty about the outlook
for demand had led to a renewed emphasis on costcontainment and efficiency improvements.  At the margin,some firms had postponed spending for the time being, withcash preservation taking precedence (see the box on page 5 forthe results of a recent survey on investment intentions).  Butplans had typically not been shelved altogether, and firms
continued to spend on routine maintenance and replacement.Across sectors, contacts emphasised the importance ofcontinual investment in their products, to maintain demand ina highly competitive environment.  And regulatory compliancenecessitated a degree of capital spending, particularly on IT.Plans for investment in additional capacity were cited lessfrequently now, as past projects came to fruition.
Exports
Exports of goods continued to grow at a steady rate, helped byongoing product innovation, and entry into new markets.  Butthere had been a further moderation in the pace of expansion,reflecting slowing world demand.  There had also recently beensome shortening in order books, and increased volatility in theflow of new orders, making it harder to gauge future demand.Firms typically reported that activity in emerging marketsremained robust, although there were a few reports of aslowing in exports to China and India.  Exports to the euro areahad also slowed somewhat, particularly to countries mostaffected by concerns about sovereign debt.
Output
Business services
Professional and financial services turnover was growing at amodest pace, but had slowed materially over the past fewmonths.  And some contacts believed that their clients haddelayed decisions due to heightened uncertainty about theoutlook.  Suppliers of services to industry continued to benefitfrom rising activity in manufacturing, though this had beenweakening.  And energy and environmental services had beensupported by the efforts of businesses in the wider economy tocut costs and minimise waste.  But some contacts had seen adeterioration in conditions, reflecting softer demand andworries about future growth, and firms continued to leave thehaulage sector and construction-related services.2

Manufacturing
The pace of expansion of manufacturing output had declined
further on the month, and reports had become more mixed.  Anumber of contacts had experienced a fall in order books, andthere were growing concerns about the prospects for demand,both at home and abroad.  Suppliers of goods destined for thedomestic household sector, and particularly producers ofdurables, typically reported fairly flat, or falling, activity inrecent months.  Food production had shown some resilience,although to some extent this reflected improvements inmarket share following consolidation in the sector.  Producersof goods destined for the public sector reported falling orders,as cuts had begun to take effect.  And suppliers to theconstruction industry had also seen a further decline in activity.
Construction
The Agents’ score indicated that activity in the constructionsector had begun to contract, compared with a year earlier(Chart 2 ).  The decline in output was in part due to the
completion of large public sector projects, and there had alsobeen a fall in repair and maintenance work for localauthorities.  This was expected to continue for some time.  Andforward-looking indicators pointed to lower private sectoractivity as well.  That tended to suggest that constructionoutput would contract further over the coming months.House building was being managed very tightly to ensure thatsupply did not outstrip demand.
Credit conditions
Firms with strong balance sheets, cash flow and profitscontinued to report that they were able to access credit oncompetitive terms.  But smaller firms typically found it moredifficult to access credit than larger ones.  And they were oftenreluctant to commit to asset-backed forms of lending, insteadof overdrafts, which continued to be withdrawn.  There werealso reports from some small and medium-sized companies, inparticular, that credit conditions had tightened further inrecent months.  On the demand side, firms were often avoidingdrawing upon overdraft facilities in case they were required as
a last resort.  And there had been a renewed focus onpreserving cash due to a growing squeeze on liquidity.  Reportsof a rise in debtor days had become more frequent, and highercosts had increased firms’ working capital requirements.  Somefirms also reported a hardening in the stance of HM Revenueand Customs on the collection of tax arrears.
Employment
Private sector employment intentions pointed to furthergrowth in jobs over the coming year, but had been softeningover the past few months ( Chart 3 ).  And rising uncertainty
about the outlook was causing some firms to revise down theirplans for recruitment.  In manufacturing, contacts stillexpected a modest increase in headcount, reflecting therelatively strong performance of the sector during therecovery.  But intentions had naturally fallen back asemployment had caught up with activity.  Firms continued tomake greater use of apprenticeships, to ensure that individualswith key skills were in place in the medium term.
Employment intentions in the service sector had also begun to
soften.  Recruitment was driven by advisory firms inengineering, IT, and financial risk compliance.  But banks wereoften considering reductions in headcount.  And for a numberof small professional services firms, the lack of a robustrecovery in demand, combined with increased fears about theoutlook, was leading to downward revisions in staffing needs.Businesses in the construction and property sectors werecontemplating fresh rounds of redundancies, while contacts inretail typically reported that staffing levels were already as lowas they could be, if minimum standards of customer servicewere to be maintained.

There was variation across sectors, however, with exporters,and their suppliers, tending to be operating at fairly high levelsof utilisation.  By contrast, producers of consumer goods forthe domestic market tended to exhibit rather larger amountsof spare capacity, and could bring temporarily mothballedproductive capacity on stream relatively easily, if demand wereto pick up.
In the service sector, businesses in growth areas, such as IT,
were often reporting high levels of capacity utilisation.  But ina variety of sectors, for instance in standardised professionalservices, firms often reported being very busy competing fornew contracts, even though they were winning relatively few,and labour productivity was often very low as a result.Consolidation was beginning to reduce oversupply in somesectors, such as haulage and construction.  And firms wereincreasingly considering how business models might bechanged to reduce the underutilisation of staff.  In theconsumer sector, for instance, there was substantial sparecapacity, due to minimum staffing requirements, leading somecontacts to shorten opening hours, or close underperformingstores, to lower the labour input.
Costs and prices
Labour costs
The Agents’ scores suggested that there had been a slightslowing in the rate of growth of labour costs in recent months.There was generally very little upward pressure onsettlements.  And for many firms, weaker-than-expectedperformance and rising uncertainty had reduced what wasconsidered affordable, while staff had become more concernedabout job security than pay.  Awards were typically between2%–3%, and reflected a combination of improved profitabilityand a degree of compensation for past wage restraint andincreases in the cost of living.  There continued to be movesaway from linking pay to official measures of inflation, withuse of performance-related pay and bonuses becoming morewidespread.  Higher awards tended to be concentrated ingrowth sectors, or for staff with particular skills, with lowersettlements more common in sectors where final demand wasespecially weak.  In the consumer-facing sector, andconstruction, for instance, pay freezes remained common, withincreases largely driven by changes to the minimum wage.
Non-labour costs
The rate of inflation in materials prices had fallen back inrecent months, as the cost of a wide variety of inputs hadbegun to level off, and even fall in some instances — related tothe recent decline in the prices of many commodities,including some foodstuffs and base metals ( Chart 4 ).  And
some contacts reported that weakening world demand hadenabled them to resist further increases for some materials.But higher energy prices continued to be passed on as firmsrenewed fixed-term contracts.  And higher energy prices were
feeding through to energy-intensive intermediate products.Inflation in the price of imports of finished goods had alsostopped gathering pace, reflecting less upward pressure fromincreases in the cost of materials.  Wage increases in emergingeconomies continued to push up on prices, although somecontacts had been able to mitigate the impact on costs, byswitching to supply from other, lower cost, countries.
Output prices
Manufacturing output price inflation remained elevated,although most contacts believed that it had peaked, reflectingmoderation in the pace of inflation in input costs ( Chart 4 ).
Where firms continued to pass on higher costs, this wastypically only partial, and firms continued to seek efficienciesand strip out unnecessary outlays.  In services, prices wererising gradually, driven by some of the larger providers of nicheprofessional services, and use of fuel escalator clauses in traveland transport services.  Fees often remained under downwardpressure in sectors where there was still oversupply,particularly for standardised legal and accountancy services,and corporate hospitality.
Consumer prices
Inflation in the price of consumer goods continued to pick up,largely due to higher energy prices.  Heavy discounting meantthat prices paid for goods were often materially lower than listprices.  But even then, the discounted prices were often risingquickly, compared to a year earlier.  And while price pointswere sometimes maintained, despite higher costs, that wasoften achieved through a reduction in pack size or quality.  Inconsumer services, the high rate of inflation was largely due toincreases in the prices of certain essential services, eitherbecause they were fuel-intensive, or because of links to officialmeasures of inflation, for instance in transportation and rent.By contrast, the price of discretionary services remained underdownward pressure, with increasing use of promotionalactivity to generate demand.4

pricesAgents’ survey on investment
In light of recent weakness in demand, and rising uncertainty
about the outlook, the Agents carried out a survey to try toassess the possible effects of these developments onbusinesses’ investment plans.  Contacts were asked about theirplans for investment over the next twelve months, comparedwith the past twelve months, and the drivers of those plans.They were also asked about whether their intentions forinvestment had been revised over the past three months, and,if they had, what had led to those revisions.  270 firmsresponded, with a combined turnover of £63 billion.
Weighting the data by turnover, firms expected a modest
increase in investment over the coming year compared withthe past year ( Chart A ).  Subtracting intentions for a reduction
in the level of investment from those for an increase ininvestment produced a positive net balance of 6%.  This broadpattern was consistent across small, medium-sized and largecompanies.  But at the sectoral level there was rather morevariation.  Among consumer-facing businesses, and those inconstruction, the modal response among firms was for verylittle change in investment.  By contrast, in manufacturingfirms either expected a material increase or decrease in capitalspending.  In services, there was a clear positive skew towardsan increase in investment.
Across firms, efficiency gains and productivity improvements
were cited as a core driver of investment.  Investment aimed atmaintaining or raising the share of the domestic market wasalso important for many firms in the services, consumer andconstruction sectors.  And services firms were more likely thanthose in other sectors to be investing in expanding exportactivity, consistent with the rising focus of services firms onexternal demand.  Manufacturers, meanwhile, tended to bemore focused on essential maintenance, perhaps becausemany of them had already undertaken investment in exportcapacity during the recovery, and now needed only to maintainexisting capital.Despite the recent weakness of activity, and the uncertain
outlook for growth, the overwhelming majority of contactsreported that they had not made any changes to investmentplans recently ( Chart B ).  That may be because, for many firms,
levels of investment are already very low, making it difficult toscale them back further.  Also, investment decisions are oftenmade over long time horizons and, as such, may be less likelyto be postponed due to perceived short-term shocks.  Andmany contacts report that continuous investment — inproduct innovation, finding efficiencies, and so on — isrequired simply to survive in the current environment.  Itremains to be seen whether firms will reappraise plans in thecoming months, if demand weakens further.
At the margin, however, a handful of firms had revised their
plans in recent months.  For those companies whoseinvestment intentions had fallen, external and internal financewere the main causes, reflecting both tighter credit availability,and pressure on internal sources of funding.  For those firmsthat had revised their plans upward, demand from emergingmarket economies was a key driver, along with a range of otherfactors, including environmental tax and credit incentives, andlegal and regulatory requirements ( Chart C ).
