December 2012Demand
Consumption
There was a further gentle pickup in retail sales growth, but the
rate of growth remained well below trend ( Chart 1 ).
Consumers remained cautious in their spending decisions.Internet and value retailers were the main beneficiaries, whilethe mid-market appeared to be feeling the brunt of thesqueeze more than the low and high ends.  Retailers reportedstronger sales of own-label products versus branded, and therewere fewer impulse purchases.  Demand for large ticket itemsremained weak as a result of fragile consumer confidence, butsales of high-tech goods and some luxuries were showingstrong growth.  Retailers remained cautious about theChristmas period, and stocks were being controlled tightly tomitigate the need to discount if sales proved sluggish.  Growthin consumer services turnover slowed marginally ( Chart 1 ), in
part reflecting a slight fall back following the Olympics-relatedboost.  Demand at outdoor attractions was still struggling dueto the wet weather, but footfall at indoor venues was morebuoyant, although revenue growth was restricted asconsumers economised on secondary spending.
Housing market
Housing market activity was flat to slightly up on a year earlier.The London market was markedly stronger — buoyed byoverseas demand.  Sales in both the new build and secondarymarkets remained below pre-recession levels.  Most activitywas at the lower end of the market, while increases in stampduty were bearing down on demand at the top end.  New buildwas performing broadly in line with the overall housingmarket, but activity was being supported by governmentassistance schemes and house builder incentives.  Continuedstrength in the rental market was driving steady growth inbuy-to-let demand.  Mortgage availability was still asignificant constraint where deposit levels were low, whichparticularly affected first-time buyers.Business investment
Investment intentions remained slightly positive year on yearwithin manufacturing and services.  Uncertainty about theeconomic outlook was often holding back investment, and thepreference to bolster cash balances or pay down existing debtwas a priority for some.  For manufacturers, the main drivers ofspending were improved efficiency and regulatoryrequirements.  UK capacity expansion plans were usuallyrestricted to those aiming to increase overseas sales orintroduce new products, and there were further reports offirms directing investment outside the United Kingdom to becloser to end customers.  In services, investment in IT toimprove efficiency and customer service, or to ensureregulatory compliance, remained strong.  While investment innew retail outlets was moderating, the need forconsumer-facing businesses to refurbish or to expand theironline presence was expected to continue to support spending.
Exports
The slowdown in export growth had eased marginally, andsales remained slightly higher on a year earlier.  Contactscontinued to report falling demand from the euro area, boththe periphery and core.  Some firms were offsetting thisweakness by increasing market share in declining markets or bypenetrating new markets;  those producing niche or high-techproducts were often the most successful.  Despite furtherreports of slowing in the global economy (eg Australasia), anumber of firms were still achieving healthy growth, asrelatively new entrants to those markets.  In particular, therewas continued strength in sectors such as oil and gasextraction, and food and drink.
Output
Business services
Business services turnover growth remained modest,constrained by subdued demand and intense competition,which was restricting pricing power ( Chart 2 ).  Contacts
involved in IT and outsourced services continued to reporthealthy growth, particularly where solutions offered increasedefficiency, although public sector demand remained subdued.Activity for services firms involved in marketing was supportedby clients increasing their focus on branding and promotionalactivity.  Reasonable growth was also being seen inengineering consultancy services.  There were some indicationsof a slight pickup in corporate transactions in accountancy andlegal, but activity was still well below pre-recession levels.Corporate recovery and insolvency work, outside of retail, alsoremained muted.  There were continued reports of weakness inproperty and construction services, although some firms noteda tentative pickup in valuation work related, for example, torefinancing of assets.  Bookings for conferencing facilitiesremained soft and, in a few regions, were falling on a yearearlier.  Activity within logistics and distribution remained2

subdued, although some firms were growing market share as
a result of industry consolidation.
Manufacturing
Annual manufacturing output growth remained marginallynegative ( Chart 2 ).  Production for export continued to
outperform that for domestic markets, although weakening inthe euro area was affecting volumes.  Across the sectorgenerally, order sizes were declining and delivery cyclesshortening, perhaps reflecting lower confidence levels andpressure on working capital among customers.  The mostbuoyant growth was being seen by firms supplying to theenergy and aerospace sectors.  Output for the automotivesector was more mixed, with weakening demand in Europebearing down on some manufacturers.  Suppliers to theconstruction sector were still facing declining volumes on ayear earlier, although a slight pickup in house building activitywas providing respite for some.  Reports from consumer goodsmanufacturers were mixed;  output was generally flat year onyear, with a few reports either side of this average.
Construction
Construction output continued to decline through 2012, andremained at low levels.  Some regions, however, were startingto see a moderation or stabilisation in the rate of decline(Chart 2 ).  This tended to reflect a modest improvement in
private sector activity in some areas, which was partiallyoffsetting continued contraction in public sector demand.There was some improvement in infrastructure projects,particularly those related to energy and rail.  Weak confidencelevels and access to credit were, however, constrainingnew-build commercial activity outside London.  Repair andmaintenance workloads continued to be buoyed byrefurbishment of retail and public sector buildings.  Housebuilding activity had improved slightly, but substantive growthwas limited to London.  Social housing development was stillongoing, but was being constrained by tightening in the supplyof grant funding.Credit conditions
There was some further evidence of the Funding for LendingScheme (FLS) leading to modest improvements in mortgageavailability and lower lending rates.  There were regionalvariations, however, and mortgage availability was still aconstraint for some house builders.  In terms of the corporatelending market, there had been less evidence of traction fromthe FLS to date.  Awareness of the Scheme among businesseswas gradually growing, but it was still under the radar of many.Demand for bank borrowing among smaller firms remainedweak, with many preferring to pay down existing debt or buildcash reserves.  And larger firms were often able to accesslong-term credit on very favourable terms via corporate bondmarkets or private funds.  Working capital facilities remainedan issue for some, and there were reports of more firms beingmoved away from overdrafts to invoice discounting.Forbearance by banks continued and insolvency levelsremained relatively low.  There were some reports though oflarger firms increasing financial support to their supply chainand customers, in response to working capital pressures.
Employment
Employment intentions over the next six months remainedbroadly flat, with headcount cuts in some areas(eg construction and consumer sectors) being offset by jobcreation elsewhere (eg aerospace, some business services).There was little evidence that a shakeout of employment wasplanned, with firms indicating they intended to retain skills inanticipation of a pickup in growth over the next year.  Manyfirms were maintaining their apprenticeship and graduateschemes, to address skill shortages or to aid successionplanning.  There was also continued growth in support roles,such as regulatory compliance and credit control.  Intentionswere marginally weaker for consumer services firms, relating inpart to consolidation of some national retail networks.Otherwise, consumer-facing firms could often not cutheadcount further without affecting customer service or theirbreadth of offer.  Recruitment conditions remained generallyeasier than normal, but skill shortages still existed in areas suchas IT and engineering, and economic uncertainty was leading tolower than normal mobility within the labour market generally.
Capacity utilisation
Firms in manufacturing and services were operating at slightlybelow normal levels of capacity utilisation ( Chart 3 ).  The
recent weakening in domestic and overseas demand, alongwith investment by some (eg exporters) in additional capacityover the past couple of years, meant that most firms couldaccommodate an increase in output fairly quickly and easily.A few bottlenecks still existed in certain production processesthough, and skill shortages were a constraint for some sectors.5 4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4 5

–Three months on the same period a year earlierChart 2 Annual growth in manufacturing output,

continued consolidation within the sector.  Some firms hadredeployed labour resources from less busy areas to functionssuch as business development, but these could easily beredirected if demand picked up.  There was, however, still asignificant surplus of physical capacity evident, for example, inrising vacancy rates in retail and secondary office space.
Costs and prices
Labour costs
Labour costs per employee continued to rise at a modest rate,and no material pickup was anticipated over the nexttwelve months.  Pay settlements were primarily in the 1%–3%range, with a significant number of pay freezes still in place(apart from national minimum wage increases), particularly inconsumer-related sectors.  Where higher awards were made,these tended to be as a result of skill shortages, or where payfreezes had been in place previously.  There was a continuedmovement away from across-the-board settlements tomerit-based increases, and in some cases bonuses wereawarded instead of pay rises.  In terms of non-pay labour costs,the greatest concern among firms related to pension funddeficits on defined benefit schemes.  Auto-enrolment was nowin effect for some larger firms, but the impact on labour costswas as yet unclear, as much would depend on take-up of thenew scheme by employees.
Non-labour costs
Non-labour cost inflation on average remained benign, but thepicture was very mixed across different commodities and otherinputs.  Inflation on many raw materials had moderated, andsome were lower on a year earlier (eg metals, cotton).  Thiswas largely as a result of softer global demand, but alsoreflected a slightly stronger sterling exchange rate.  The mainexception was foodstuffs.  Poor harvests were addingconsiderably to farmers’ feed costs, and the cost of othercrops, including fruit and vegetables, was also up substantiallyon a year earlier.  Far East wage cost pressure and increasedshipping costs were still contributing to higher imported goodsprices, albeit there was some offset from weaker demand and
exchange rate effects.  Energy costs were a frequentlymentioned concern, with some firms experiencing a laggedeffect from previous price rises as long-term contracts expired.
Output prices
Manufacturing output prices were increasing modestly year onyear ( Chart 4 ).  Firms that were innovating or operating in
niche markets often had relatively strong pricing power.  Otherfirms (eg consumer sector suppliers), however, struggled topass through cost increases into output prices, and hence thetrend to re-engineer products or reduce packet sizes tomaintain margins was increasing.  Greater competition fromEuropean competitors, who were focusing on the UK market asdomestic demand weakened, was adding further pressure tosome firms’ margins.  Output prices in services were broadlyflat on a year earlier ( Chart 4 ).  Professional fees were often
under downward pressure due to intense competition,particularly for standardised services (such as audit), butselective fee increases in other areas meant overall prices wereflat.  Some cost pass-through was being achieved in thehaulage and distribution sector.
Consumer prices
Consumer goods price inflation had picked up marginally.Announced utility price rises had started to filter through, andwould continue to do so over the next couple of months.Some food prices had started to rise as a result of poorharvests (eg fresh fruit, vegetables and bread), with inflation inother foodstuffs (eg meat) expected to feed through over thenext few months.  Retailers’ promotional activity was likely tocontinue to dampen the impact on headline price inflation.Consumer services price inflation had increased a little, largelydue to rises in public transport prices and social housing rentsearlier in the year, alongside the autumn increase in tuitionfees.  Some public transport prices were expected to rise againin the new year, but competition and weak demand werelikely to continue to bear down on inflation in many otherconsumer services.4

–Ability to meet expected demand over the next six monthsChart 3 Capacity UtilisationAgents’ survey on investment and research
and development intentions
The Agents asked businesses about capital expenditure, and
research and development spending over the past year, andtheir intentions for the next twelve months.  Firms were alsoasked to indicate how various factors were likely to affect theirinvestment plans over the next twelve months.  Four hundredand thirty nine companies participated in the survey, with acombined UK turnover of around £120 billion.  The followingresults are weighted by turnover.
Overall, firms reported a modest increase in investment over
the past twelve months, compared with the previous year.Investment intentions for the next year were stronger:  onbalance, more firms expected to increase investment over thenext twelve months ( Chart A ).
There was some variation across firm size, with the
improvement in investment intentions most marked for thelargest (UK turnover of over £400 million) and smallest firms(UK turnover of up to £50 million) in the sample.  Theproportion of medium-sized firms (UK turnover of £51 millionto £400 million) reporting an improvement in intentions waslower.  In terms of sectors, most showed a modest increase ininvestment over the past year.  While intentions for the yearahead were positive for all sectors, they were stronger forrespondents in manufacturing and consumer services than forthose in business services and construction.
In terms of the factors affecting investment spending
(Chart B ), the majority of respondents expected the quest for
future efficiency/productivity gains to boost investment overthe next year.  Investment in additional capacity to supply newand existing export markets, and to meet demand for new andexisting products, was also expected to boost investment over
the next twelve months.  For the majority of respondents,essential maintenance and replacement was not expected tohave a material impact on the level of investment for the yearahead, although it was cited as a driver of capital spending bysome firms.  The most significant factor weighing down oninvestment plans over the next year was uncertainty about theeconomic and financial environment.  The cost or availabilityof external finance, the availability of internal finance, andother factors, were constraining investment plans for only asmall minority of firms surveyed.
Research and development spending plans over the next
twelve months were also more positive, compared with thepast year ( Chart C ).  The strongest intentions were reported
among larger firms, and for those within manufacturing andconsumer services.  It should be noted, however, that asignificant proportion of survey respondents answered ‘notapplicable’ to the question, suggesting that they did notengage in such activity.
