June 2013Demand
Consumption
Nominal growth in retail sales values had continued at a slow
pace.  Contacts had continued to report tough tradingconditions.  But the expansion of on-line trading and polarisingconsumer demand, which favoured both premium and valuegoods, had enabled some firms to increase sales.  Someretailers’ sales of foodstuffs had strengthened at the expenseof non-foods, in part because unseasonal weather conditionshad held back demand for fashions and outdoor equipment.Demand for household durables had responded moderately toincreasing housing market activity.  But growth in sales of newcars, notably those offering more economical motoring, hadremained strong.  Consumer services turnover hadstrengthened very slightly ( Chart 1 ), which reflected higher
prices for some regulated services, but also the growingpopularity of cafés and occasional luxuries such as visits torestaurants or attending special events.  There had also beenslight growth in demand for some transportation services, andfor conveyancing.  But delaying the purchase of services, orswitching suppliers in pursuit of price reductions, had alsobeen widely reported. 
Housing market
The level of activity in the housing market had continued togrow, and some home builders had noticed a pickup in theirenquiry rate following the announcements in the recentBudget .  In the secondary market, fewer transactions were
falling through.  A number of contacts believed that vendors’price expectations had moderated somewhat, helping sales toprogress, though outside London some higher-priced propertyremained slow to sell.  There had been reports of prices firmingsomewhat in the new homes market.  In the lower pricebrackets buy-to-let investors remained prevalent, reflecting acontinuation of both strong demand and attractive rentalreturns, and there were some signs of institutions entering thissector.  Most contacts expected activity in the housing marketto continue growing during the year. Business investment
The rate of growth in investment intentions remained subduedacross the economy in aggregate.  It had howeverstrengthened a little in the services sector, where spending onrefurbishment programmes and new formats had continued tobe reported by hotels, restaurants and retail chains.  Servicesector investment in IT was also said to be strengthening, toimprove both back-office efficiency and customer-facingservices.  And regulatory changes had continued to encouragethe replacement of passenger transport and heavy goodsvehicles.  Investment in additional physical capacity remaineduncommon among manufacturers outside the oil and gassupply chain or the automotive industry.  But programmeswith short payback periods, such as greater energy efficiency,or more efficient plant and equipment, were proceeding.  Andsome contacts had reported a pickup in spending on researchand development.  Prospects for foreign direct investmentwere thought to be improving as the gap between costs ofproduction in the United Kingdom and some developingeconomies gradually narrowed.  To a certain extent, however,hedging strategies and the need to be close to end-customerswould continue to motivate investment in offshore facilities.In an Agents’ survey of a sample of companies with definedbenefit pension schemes (see page 6), some companiesreported that pension deficits were having an impact on theirinvestment decisions and on mergers and acquisitions activity.
Exports
Gentle growth in export volumes had continued ( Chart 2 ).
Aerospace and oil and gas markets had remained strong and aperiod of de-stocking in the automotive supply chain hadreportedly ceased, contributing to stronger demand from anumber of developed economies.  However, exports ofmanufactured goods to the core countries of the euro area hadremained weak.  A number of contacts had seen a slightimprovement in sales to the euro-area periphery, though theyhad expressed concerns about payment prospects.  Demandfor consumer goods was strengthening from European marketsoutside the euro area.  Some manufacturers that hadpreviously repatriated production to the United Kingdom were2

services sector, sales of professional services associated withtransactions, infrastructure and property construction hadrisen further, most notably in Asia, and exports of educationservices had continued to grow.  Imports had also risen slowly.The late growing season had increased dependency on freshproduce imports from the euro area, and UK biofuelproduction was said to be more dependent on imported grainthan in 2012.
Output
Business services
Growth in business services output had continued at a slowbut steady rate.  For professional firms, the market for certaincore services had remained highly competitive but the gradualpickup in corporate transactional activity was continuing, anda number of firms had won new international contracts for thesupply of engineering, architectural and business investmentservices.  Business advice was also expanding gradually, asclients entered new markets.  IT consultancy had continued toincrease, as had asset finance, invoice discounting and sometrade credit insurance.  But demand for advertising andmarketing services remained flat, and firms’ tight budgetarycontrol had also restrained growth in demand for conferencesand corporate hospitality.  While home delivery services hadcontinued to expand and some goods storage services had picked up, haulage volumes had remained broadly flatoverall. 
Manufacturing
Output had continued to expand at a very moderate pace andsome contacts expected order books to strengthen further asthe year progressed.  In addition to rising production foreventual export, such as in capital equipment, intermediateand luxury goods sectors, there had been signs of a gradualrevival in domestic demand ( Chart 2 ).  For example, some
suppliers of building materials had begun to see an increase insales to home builders, and output of consumer goods for thedomestic market had also risen slightly.  A proportion of theoverall increase in output of plant and machinery was alsodestined for the UK market, where domestic demand forcapital equipment from the oil and gas sector had remainedstrong.  Weaker areas of output had included food processing,which had remained flat overall, and output from the defenceindustries, where orders had fallen since last year and firmswere seeking new markets.
Construction
Falls in output had continued to slow ( Chart 3 ).  Few contacts
envisaged a general recovery in demand in the short tomedium term.  But some contacts had seen forward orderbooks firm up and early-stage work, such as land purchasing,had risen.  New private housing continued to provide the bestimmediate growth opportunities.  Construction of new homes
for sale had increased in response to market support measuresand improved mortgage availability.  A short-term pickup inconstruction of social housing was also in prospect, though amore general increase in output would only be likely whenmedium to longer-term funding streams became clearer.Private non-housing demand had remained weak, with onlylimited requirements for new industrial or commercial space,or for property renovation.  Public demand had flattened off ata relatively modest level, with fewer projects and at lowervalues, and civil engineering volumes remained low.  Somecontractors had become increasingly dependent for work onrepair, maintenance and building services.  Contacts had alsonoted a continuing reduction in supply, as some other firms inthe sector either failed or withdrew from the market. 
Credit conditions
The Funding for Lending Scheme had increased competitionfor the better commercial risks and continued to lower firms’borrowing costs.  However, among the firms that had beenoffered new loans, a proportion had continued to declinethem, either because of cash balances that they could drawupon or because they were reluctant to accept the terms andconditions on loan proposals.  Some contacts regarded majorlenders’ risk appetite as little changed, so that firms with weakbalance sheets, or in certain sectors, still struggled to obtainworking capital or to finance growth.  This was leading to thegradual expansion, albeit from a low base, of new, privatesources of lending, particularly where business advisers hadbecome familiar with the process.  Additionally, some publicly backed local or regional funds had begun advancingfinance.  For households, eligibility for the best mortgage dealshad remained somewhat restricted in spite of the generaleasing of loan terms and prices.  Mortgage valuations werethought by contacts to have remained cautious, and stresstesting of loan applications had reportedly increased, whichhad lengthened approval processes.  Strong demand for newcars was said to have partly reflected growth in the take-up ofconsumer credit. Agents’ summary of business conditions June 2013 3

Employment prospects both in manufacturing and business
services had firmed up a little.  Contacts in the manufacturingsector had indicated that a period of planned headcountreductions was largely complete ( Chart 4 ) and that
employment prospects were now broadly flat.  In the businessservices sector, employment was expected to edge up further,though tempered both by initial absorption of spare capacity,and by internal redeployments, as well as by the effects ofsome marginal further offshoring of facilities.  Somecontinuing rationalisation of professional services was alsoenvisaged.  Employment prospects within consumer servicesfirms had remained broadly flat at what contacts frequentlycharacterised as a base level, but a better balance was nowapparent between contracting and expanding firms.Recruitment had remained, on average, a little easier thannormal, with good-quality applications reported for manyvacant positions.  However, some posts had remained hard tofill.  This reflected continuing shortages of some technicalskills, most notably, but not exclusively, in engineering and IT.Many contacts had highlighted the flexibility of the labour supply, with the acceptance by some employees ofcontracts guaranteeing no minimum hours’ work providingone example. 
Capacity utilisation
Capacity utilisation had remained slightly below average bothin manufacturing and services.  This reflected the recentweakness in domestic demand as well as earlier investment inadditional human and physical resources.  Only limited (andusually very industry-specific) pressure was evident on plant,equipment, buildings or labour;  and growth in productivecapacity was reported to be slight.  The supply of prime officestock in several regional centres had continued to tighten.  And some contacts had commented on the gradual ageing ofmuch of the underutilised secondary retail or office stock,which suggested a steady erosion of effective service sectorcapacity.  A number of other contacts had highlighted skills
shortages in certain trades, which could impinge on futuresupply growth.
Costs and prices
Labour costs
Regular pay in both manufacturing and services was increasingat a slow pace, broadly similar to the rates seen a year earlier,though there had been a slight increase in the number of payfreezes reported.  Pay pressure from employees had remainedweak.  The practice of relating pay settlements either to pastperformance or to gains in productivity, rather than to the cost of living, had continued to spread.  Some employers,motivated by retention, had made additional awards to keymembers of staff.  But recent falls in bonuses and overtimepayments, as well as labour flexibility, had enabled employersto restrain labour cost growth.  Looking forward, manycontacts remained uncertain about what impact auto-enrolment in pension schemes would have on their pay bills. 
Non-labour costs
For most contacts, inflation in non-labour costs had nowstabilised at a lower level than the previous year.  Overall,inflation in imported finished goods prices had remainedsomewhat stronger than for raw materials.  And some furtherimpact from sterling’s most recent depreciation was stillexpected over the coming months, given the usual duration offorward contracts.  The prices of some metals, plastics andcotton goods, were said to have fallen back and falls in theprice of other metals and oil-based products were still comingthrough.  However for food processors, input price inflationhad remained elevated and additional food commodities hadrisen in price.  Many contacts had identified domesticoverheads, such as waste management, business rates andparticularly energy prices, as concerns, but the cost ofinsurance services remained weak. 
Output prices and margins
The rate of inflation in manufacturers’ and business servicesprices had remained subdued.  Clauses governing the pass-through of annual efficiency gains, or volatility in theprices of materials and fuels, had continued to operatenormally.  A number of manufacturers had reported slightlyeasier price negotiations with their customers and some hadadjusted their product mix to improve both average prices andmargins.  But supermarkets had continued to resist upwardpressure from their suppliers, and only partial pass-through ofrecent cost increases for foodstuffs had been possible.  Sparecapacity in many parts of the business services sector hadcontinued to restrain price growth, but a number of firms hadbegun to decline low-margin work.  Similarly, a number oflarger construction companies had become more selective4

about tender opportunities.  Productivity improvements,
tighter procurement policies, and an increase in the sterlingvalue of foreign earnings, had all supported profitability. 
Consumer prices
Contacts had reported a flattening off in the rate of consumerprice inflation.  The price sensitivity of many discretionarypurchases and a fall in fuel costs had begun to offset some ofthe upward pressure coming from sterling’s depreciation,earlier commodity price increases, and higher passengertransport and utility company charges.  In the grocery market,further price rises were anticipated for some unprocessedfoods, including certain meat and dairy goods, but inflation
had softened for other products and a number of prices hadfallen back.  A build-up of unsold spring clothing was expectedto be discounted at some point.  But in the automotivemarket, a short supply of used cars was said to have causedprices to edge up.  Peak season summer holidays werereported to be slower to sell than last year, holding prices flat.Price increases for other leisure services were tending to berestricted to specific hotels or restaurants.  For some transportservices the rate of inflation, and occasionally the price level,had eased, as a result of falls in fuel costs.  And inflation inindex-linked housing rents had slowed. Agents’ survey on defined benefit pension
schemes
Defined benefit (DB) pension scheme deficits have grown since
early 2011.  The aggregate deficit of the 6,316 DB schemeseligible for the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) rose to £256.6 billion at the end of April 2013.  Around 80% of thoseschemes are in deficit.  In order to help the Monetary PolicyCommittee understand how firms are responding to thegrowth in DB pension deficits, the Bank’s Agents conducted asurvey of firms during April and May 2013, covering around 90 DB schemes.  The survey was supplemented by discussionswith specialist professionals, as well as a review of almost 380 records of Agents’ visits to firms with DB schemes over theprevious 18 months — these confirm the broad patternsemerging from the survey.  
Companies with a DB scheme in deficit are required to submit
a recovery plan to The Pensions Regulator, which expects adeficit to be eliminated as quickly as the employer canreasonably afford.  Among the sample, employer contributionswere widely reported to have increased, although a few firmshad been able to maintain or reduce them, in some cases witha lengthening of the recovery plan.  In addition, many firmswere taking action to reduce both the current and futureburden of deficits on their business, for example by sharing theburden with employees.  Professional advisers noted a growingnumber of firms transferring assets or income streams to avoidlocking cash in the pension fund, a dynamic that was alsoreflected in the survey responses ( Chart A ).  
As part of this survey, respondents were asked about the wider
effects of deficits on their behaviour.  In many cases firmsreported that their DB pension deficits were having no impacton key business decisions ( Chart B ) as the scale of deficits
and/or contributions were relatively limited.  However, anumber of firms reported a ‘major’ impact on their ability tobuy, sell or restructure businesses.  Some firms reported thatthey had less cash for acquisitions or, more commonly, that
potential acquirers were reluctant to make bids for businesseswith DB schemes, even where not in deficit, given uncertaintyover ultimate liabilities.  Around half of firms surveyedreported a somewhat negative impact from deficits on theirinvestment spending, with the proportion doing so greater forsmall and medium-sized enterprises than for larger companies.Pension schemes could, of course, invest in other firms, whocould in turn use the funds for capital spending, potentiallyoffsetting some of the negative impact on investmentreported in this survey.
A sizable proportion of firms reported a negative effect on
dividends and pay.  Lower dividends for some firms, in part,reflected pension fund trustees and the regulator seeking abalance between the distribution of cash/profits toshareholders and contributions to address pension schemedeficits.  A number of firms also noted that deficits werereducing their appetite for credit, as increased borrowingwould raise the costs of their PPF levy.
