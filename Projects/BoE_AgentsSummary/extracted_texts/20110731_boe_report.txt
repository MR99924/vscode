July 2011Demand
Consumption
Nominal spending continued to grow, but at a slow pace.
Contacts reported that signs of a strengthening in demand inthe early spring had been short-lived.  Reflecting this change inconditions, levels of stock had risen in some non-food sectors.Discretionary spending had been particularly affected, anddemand for many bigger ticket items had softened.  CentralLondon retailers, however, continued to benefit fromincreasing numbers of foreign visitors.  Some other retailershad become more pessimistic about the outlook, fearingfurther downward pressure on household incomes. 
Growth of consumer services turnover also remained weak
(Chart 1 ).  And there had been a fall in discretionary 
spending on services, such as vehicle maintenance and property conveyancing.  Car parking revenues were falling, in part because consumers were economising by using public transport.  Spending on domestic tourism wasgenerally expected to match last year’s level, althoughbookings were very late.  Premium travel and hotelaccommodation, along with concerts and sports events,continued to sell well. 
Housing market
Contacts reported that, overall, activity had softened in recent weeks.  The level of stock had begun to pick up andprices were expected to decline somewhat.  Many prospectivefirst-time buyers continued to be unable to purchase.  Thatwas supporting the lettings market, which continued to attract investors, particularly in locations with a highproportion of younger people.  Construction of new homes forsale was, in general, flattening off.  With builders focusing onhomes for buyers with existing equity, there was increasingdemand for sites suitable for such properties.  Uncertaintyabout public sector financial support and expectations ofreduced grant funding were restraining construction of socialhousing. Business investment
Investment intentions continued to rise but the overall rate ofinvestment growth was thought to have moderated slightly(Chart 2 ).  Growth tended to be strongest for exporters,
including those in the aerospace and automotive sectors, forexample.  Parts of the agricultural sector were also reported tobe investing strongly, encouraged by high prices for arablecommodities.  Capital expenditure growth in service sectorfirms was expected to continue increasing at a modest pace.Spending on ICT was rising, to achieve efficiencies and provideadditional marketing capability.  Reports of other plansincluded increased private investment in public transportsystems.  According to contacts, growth in retail floor spacewas slowing a little. 
There continued to be reports of investment schemes, which
previously had been deferred, being implemented.  But somesuch projects had now been completed, and a number ofcontacts had become more cautious about spending oncapital.  Some contacts described overseas investment asoffering a greater competitive advantage than spending athome, but others were bringing production back in-house toreduce supply risk. 
Exports and imports
Manufacturing exports continued to grow at a brisk pace,though for some firms the rate was now slowing slightly (Chart 3 ).  And more firms had begun to switch resources from
domestic to export marketing, including contacts in mining,construction and property-related professional services.Demand for exports of capital goods, such as precisionengineering and construction equipment, remained strong, asdid demand for industrial chemicals and certain luxuryconsumer goods.  
Geographically, demand from Germany, thought to be
predominantly for re-export, remained firm but otherEuropean markets were generally less so.  And exports tocountries affected by concerns surrounding sovereign debttended to be particularly weak.  Emerging markets hadcontinued to provide opportunities for strong growth,2

although policy tightening in some of these countries had
begun to slow orders.  The impact of disturbances in the Middle East remained slight.
Contacts reported that growth in the volume of imports had
slowed a little.  This was thought to reflect both supply issuesand softer domestic demand.  Imports of cars from producersaffected by the tsunami had weakened.  But some contactshad been able to overcome disruptions to supplies of Japanesefinished and semi-finished goods by sourcing them from theUnited Kingdom.  Japanese firms themselves had also begun tosource more goods from UK suppliers, both for plants here andin their home market. 
Output
Business services
Overall, turnover was thought to have continued to growslowly.  For professional and financial services firms, there wasstill little sign of recovery in transaction-related work,although some contacts believed that overseas investors were becoming more active.  The demand for manystandardised professional services had been more than usuallyprice-sensitive, but output of some higher margin advisoryfunctions was picking up, which was supporting turnover. 
Suppliers of ICT systems and travel and marketing services
continued to report an improvement in business conditions.Activity was still strengthening among freight forwarders andothers associated with export logistics.  But there had beenreports of weaker domestic demand for haulage of consumergoods, and carriage of construction industry inputs remainedweak.  
Manufacturing
Domestic manufacturing output growth remained broadlystable ( Chart 3 ).  Supply difficulties continued to affect some
firms, but import substitution by, for example, customersseeking alternatives to recently disrupted Japanese supply, wasenabling certain other producers to raise their output.  Anumber of contacts reported that they had begun to see
growth soften a little, as business customers completedreplenishment of stocks.  Producers of consumer durables werefeeling the impact of weaker household spending.  Andsuppliers to the public sector reported softening activity.Growth in output for export continued to be at a faster pacethan for domestic demand, but some contacts reported that ithad slowed a little. 
Construction
Output continued to rise slowly and remained well below pre-recession levels.  Investment in new commercial officespace remained weak outside of London.  And beyond thecapital, prospects were generally thought to be poor.  Largefirms were pursuing smaller contracts than usual and somehad begun to look overseas for new business.  But theconstruction of new retail space and budget hotels wascontinuing, if a little more slowly than before, and utilitycompanies’ spend on infrastructure was said to have increased.There had been a decline in public sector capital spending, butrepairs, maintenance and refurbishment had picked up. 
Credit conditions
Contacts at larger firms were typically able to access bankfinance if required, but for small and medium-sized enterprisescredit conditions remained more variable.  A number ofcontacts felt that borrowing costs had begun to decline a little.But firms renegotiating older facilities continued to see someoverdraft facilities replaced by asset-based finance and spreadsover reference rates increase.  Lenders continued to report thatsome firms were reluctant to borrow.  A number of contactshad observed that debtor days were growing, and that wassqueezing cash flow.  
Employment
Employment intentions indicated that jobs would continue tobe created at a modest pace.  The findings of a special surveyon the prospects for private sector employment aresummarised in the box on page 5.  Some contacts suggestedthat recruitment of technical and managerial labour was beinghampered somewhat because potential appointees wereunusually immobile, both because of a difficult mortgagemarket and the fear of falling victim to ‘last in, first out’policies once in new employment.  There had been little newsof further changes to the level of public employment, butweaker public and consumer spending were resulting in jobshedding by charities.
Capacity utilisation
Capacity utilisation had continued to rise at a steady pace.Exporters were absorbing spare capacity more quickly than

–Three months on same period a year earlierChart 3 Manufacturing outputfirms facing the domestic market.  Some manufacturers that
were operating at close to capacity reported that capitalinvestment, increased multi-skilling among their staff, and theopportunity to flex either working hours or input fromtemporary labour, would provide additional scope to raiseoutput.  But not all were willing to commit resources tocreating additional capacity at present, and somedisplacement to overseas production facilities was takingplace.  For a few contacts, constraints in supply chains hadbecome more problematic. 
Spare capacity in the services sector remained significant.
Generally, contacts in the sector were not yet facing capacityconstraints, although these were now approaching for somefirms.  The degree of price competition in business servicescontinued to suggest a below-normal level of activity.  Inconsumer services, weakening demand had resulted in risingspare capacity within some firms. 
Costs and prices
Labour costs
Pay awards were typically reported to be around 2%–3%, withcontacts continuing to report little pressure for settlementsthat were in line with inflation.  And in sectors other thanmanufacturing, a significant minority of firms still had payfreezes in place.  In addition, a number of firms had recentlydeferred their 2011 settlement until the outlook becameclearer.  More contacts were linking a proportion of their payaward to productivity targets or other performance measures.Rises in the National Minimum Wage and employers’ NationalInsurance contributions continued to add to total labour costs.
Non-labour costs
The price of commodities remained very high, althoughcontacts thought that the pace of further cost increases waslikely to slow, due to additional supply and softening worlddemand.  Wage inflation and rising domestic demand in Chinaand some other developing economies were adding to thecosts of finished goods imported from those countries.Contacts expected such cost increases to take longer tomoderate than the prices of commodities.  The large fall in thevalue of sterling from around the middle of 2007 was judgedto have had its full effect on input costs.  But the recentdecline in sterling was a concern for some importers.  For amajority of contacts, increases in the cost of gas and electricitywere also a worry, particularly where fixed-price contractswere about to expire. 
Output prices
The Agents’ scores for output prices suggested broadlyunchanged inflation on the month.  For manufacturers, theslow pass-through of cost increases was putting downwardpressure on profitability ( Chart 4 ).  The problem was
particularly acute for those selling predominantly to thedomestic market.  And food producers continued to reportthat supermarkets were very resistant to price increases.Overseas markets were felt to be an easier environment inwhich to achieve higher prices.  Some firms were also findingthat it was easier to rebuild margins by introducing newproducts than by renegotiating prices for existing ones.
Construction industry tender rates were reported to have
fallen close to cost in some cases.  There remained strongdownward pressure on the prices of many standardisedbusiness services, lowering margins.  And commercial rentscontinued to be weak, although they had shown signs ofstabilising.  Prices were increasing for some specialist businessservices, along with some banking, telecommunication anddistribution services.  
Consumer prices
Price promotions and earlier than usual summer sales ofclothing, footwear and durables had partially offset upwardpressure from VAT, duty increases and rising input costs.  Someprice increases were said to have been postponed or scaledback because of the recent weakness of consumer spending.Retailers continued to react to changing consumer demand bymodifying their product ranges, to offer goods at price pointsthat would represent better value for money.
Consumer services prices presented a mixed picture.  Travel
and transport prices continued to increase, in part becausepublic subsidies were being scaled back, but also because ofinflation indexation agreements.  Some air fares had risen.And more utility companies had announced increases in theprice of energy.  But for services such as holidayaccommodation and catering there was less scope to raiseprices and discounting was common.  Housing rents remainedhigh but appeared to have stabilised.4

ManufacturingThree months on same period a year earlierChart 4 Pre-tax profitabilityAgents’ survey on employment
Employment has grown over the past year, despite subdued
output growth and the likelihood that some companies havebeen operating with unusually high levels of spare capacityfollowing the recession.  The Agents conducted a survey ofcontacts during May and June 2011, asking them aboutchanges in the size of their workforce and the factors affectinghiring decisions.  468 firms responded, with a combined UKemployment of about 457,000. 
Employment in the sample was reported to have risen by
about 1% in the past year, a similar rate of increase to thatshown by official data on private sector workforce jobs in theyear to the first quarter.  Overall, employment was expected torise at a similar pace over the coming year, but there weresome differences in expectations between the main sectors ofthe economy ( Chart A ). 
Manufacturers reported the biggest increase in jobs over the
past year, but expected growth to slow over the next year.Construction employment was, on average, expected to bebroadly flat, following large falls over the past year.  Businessservices employment, which had been flat in the past year, wasexpected to pick up somewhat.
Among the factors that were cited as influencing employment
changes, expected demand was the most significant, leadingfirms both to increase employment in the past year, and toexpect to over the coming year ( Charts B and C).  Existing or
expected skills shortages were also motivating somerecruitment. 
The most important factor cited as reducing employment,
both over the past year and in the year to come, was changesin productivity.  This suggested that, among the respondents tothe survey at least, continuing efficiency improvements werereducing demand for labour — in stark contrast to the picturepainted by the official data, in which productivity growth hadbeen weak over the past year. 
Changes in labour costs had helped to support employment
growth over the past year.  But they were expected, onbalance, to reduce employment over the next year, suggestingthat firms anticipated an increase in the cost of labour goingforward. Agents’ summary of business conditions July 2011 5
