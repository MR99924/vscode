July 2013Demand
Consumption
Annual growth in retail sales values had edged higher over the
first half of the year, but remained modest ( Chart 1 ).
Disposable incomes had remained tight, reflected in reportsfrom some retailers of ‘payday spikes’ in consumer spending.There were some reports of a mild strengthening of householddurable sales, though that might have partly reflected theeffect of some major retailer failures on the sales of others.Growth in new car sales remained robust, driven bypromotional activity, discounts and relatively easy terms formotor finance.  But poor weather was reported to have led toweak clothing and footwear sales, with some customersdelaying purchases in expectation of heavy summer salesdiscounting to come.  Growth in the value of consumerservices, though still modest overall, had edged up, in partreflecting a slight increase in demand for tourism, travel andvisitor attractions. 
Housing market
There were continued reports of rising housing market activityboth for new and existing homes.  In the new-build market,improving conditions were partly ascribed to the effects of thenew Help to Buy scheme (applying to England only).Mortgage availability and pricing had continued to ease,though some contacts reported stringent conditions on higherloan to value loans, including those to first-time buyers.Buy-to-let investors were reported to be highly activereflecting a combination of perceptions that downside risks tohouse prices had abated, easing credit availability and a desirefor higher returns than were available on bank deposits.  Asubstantial number of those investors were cash buyers and sodid not require mortgages for house purchase.  The widerpickup in housing market activity was expected to be reflectedmore noticeably in mortgage approvals in the coming months,notwithstanding some reports that strict criteria andinsufficient staff at lenders had slowed the mortgage approvalprocess.  Some contacts also reported that shortages in sites
for new house building and in existing properties for sale werestarting to hold back transaction volumes.
Business investment
Investment intentions continued to point to only modestgrowth in capital spending and had edged lower on the monthas some earlier projects had been completed.  Investment wassaid to be dominated by efficiency-enhancing expenditureswith a short payback period, with very little large-scalecapacity expansion.  For firms that were investing, that wasoften reported to be financed from internal sources, partlyreflecting constraints on long-term financing or a desire not tobe dependent on bank finance.  Larger international companieswere often reported to be focusing investment spending closer to fast-growing emerging markets.  In some cases,replacement expenditures were reported to have beenlong-delayed.  In the transport sector, however, substantialreplacement of older vehicles was under way with a focus onincreasing fuel efficiency.
Exports
Modest growth in manufactured export volumes hadcontinued ( Chart 2 ), with weakness in euro-area demand
offset by growth in sales to other European markets, theUnited States and the emerging markets.  Export growthremained concentrated in products for the oil and gas industry,premium brands with a broad international reach or highvalue-added niche products.  Some automobile exports hadbeen negatively affected by the continuing weak demand inthe euro area.  There were continued reports of rising servicesexports, including from some law firms delivering work inglobal markets and from accountancy firms who had benefitedfrom an international recognition of UK professional standards.IT services exports had risen further, as had engineering andconstruction consultancy services exports to the Middle East inparticular.  Inbound tourism to the United Kingdom was alsoreported to have strengthened.  A steady, albeit subdued, flowof production relocation to the United Kingdom continued, inpart reflecting rising labour costs in some emerging markets.
Output
Business services
Growth in business services turnover remained moderateand little changed ( Chart 2 ).  Alongside steady growth in
IT services, related in part to growth in e-commerce, therewere reports of some rising activity in marketing, advertisingand corporate hospitality as firms sought to gain business in ahighly competitive business environment.  There were alsoreports of some increase in haulier demand for home deliveriesrelated to internet sales.  And hiring of construction equipmenthad risen as activity in some parts of the construction sectorhad picked up.  A gentle increase in professional and financial2

–Chart 1 Retail sales and consumer services turnoverservices turnover was reported, due in part to a rise in activity
related to mergers and acquisitions and international taxconsultancy.  There were also reports of increased work relatedto land deals and around residential and industrial real estateinvestment.  More generally, accountancy work was reportedto have risen moderately as confidence in the wider economyhad recovered somewhat, and as some banks had taken furtherefforts to restructure companies on their ‘intensive care’ lists.
Manufacturing
Annual growth in manufacturing output for the domesticmarket had risen ( Chart 2 ).  In particular, some strengthening
had been seen in the production of certain constructionmaterials and aggregates used in the early stages of building,though the level of output remained subdued.  Car productionhad benefited from a buoyant domestic market, though somesupply chains had been adversely affected by weak productionin the euro area.  Output was said to be rising in parts of thecapital goods sector, particularly those related to the oil andgas industry.  In aerospace, some contacts noted an easing inthe recent strong growth of production, albeit one that wasexpected to be short-lived.  But some defence firms reportedthat their production was being affected materially by acontraction in both international and domestic militaryspending.
Construction
The annual rate of decline of construction output hadcontinued to ease so that output in the past three months waslittle changed on a year earlier ( Chart 3 ).  House builders
reported an improvement in sentiment, in part reflecting theintroduction of the Government’s Help to Buy scheme, withactivity up in recent months and expected to acceleratefurther.  Social housing build activity had also increased, withHousing Associations seeking to use the public fundingavailable in the current financing cycle.  Elsewhere in thesector, public sector construction activity was reported to bebroadly stable, but low relative to pre-crisis levels and oftenfocused on smaller-scale education and health projects.Infrastructure work remained robust, particularly for
renewable energy development, though someregulatory-driven investment demand in rail and water utilitieshad started to wane.  Private commercial activity remainedweak outside London, with little or no speculativedevelopment under way.
Credit conditions
A slow improvement in credit availability and pricingcontinued, with some signs that strong competition amongbanks to meet lending targets was starting gradually toincrease lending appetite beyond the largest companies andstrongest credit propositions.  For example, there were reportsof some increase in appetite among banks for lending tomedium-sized companies or to commercial propertycompanies.  Some small companies said that they hadaccessed bank funding while resisting demands for high levelsof personal guarantees and security.  But banks were reportedto have remained reluctant to lend to small businesses orstart-ups with few assets, and even where balance sheets werestrong, extended loan approval times were reported.  Therewere also reports of difficulty in accessing international tradefinance in particular.  Demand for bank finance remainedsubdued, reflecting muted economic growth and a desire bycompanies to limit their reliance on bank debt, though it wasreported to have increased a little among medium and largefirms, as mergers and acquisitions and property-relatedactivity had edged higher.  A build-up of cash balances by firmswas widely reported, in some cases reflecting companies’desire to satisfy auditor requirements for demonstrating theywere ‘a going concern’.  For companies that were not largeenough to access bond markets, other forms of non-bankfinance were reported to be increasing, albeit from a low base.More widely, invoice payment times were reportedly risingfurther, putting smaller companies’ working capital understrain.Agents’ summary of business conditions July 2013 3

–Chart 3 Construction outputEmployment
Employment intentions had edged higher over recent months
alongside some improvement in business confidence.  Inmanufacturing, employment intentions were said to be risingslightly as output had increased, concentrated in export supplychains or among firms bringing out new products.  Somebusiness services employers also reported rising employmentalongside higher turnover, with greater replacement wherenatural attrition had taken place and with some increase inrecruitment activity, often aimed at raising the employment ofmore junior staff to restrain labour costs growth.  There werealso reports within the business services sector of employeesbeing moved back to more immediately productive roles fromthe ‘business development’ positions to which they had beenassigned while demand was particularly weak.  Consumerservices staffing was widely reported to have remained at thelower bounds consistent with firms’ effective functioning andemployment intentions were flat.  However, there were somereports of increases in employment in discount retailing andIT offsetting the negative effects on employment of gradualconsolidation in some other parts of the retail sector andreduced staffing at some high street banks.  Most employersreported that recruitment conditions were a little easier thannormal outside IT and engineering, though there wereincreasing reports of localised shortages in certainconstruction skills and sub-contractor labour, as well as inadvanced marketing or customer service skills.
Capacity utilisation
Capacity utilisation had remained slightly below normal,though it had risen marginally in manufacturing in recentmonths.  In many cases, both in manufacturing and services,investment aimed at enhancing efficiency was providingmarginal increases in capacity to match gently rising output;alternatively, any increases in output were able to be readilymet by the reconfiguration of existing capacity or flexible useof existing staff.  That could involve added shifts in somemanufacturing firms and, in business services, some return ofstaff to more ‘front-line’ roles.  Some legal sector contactsreported that conveyancing capacity at legal firms had beenremoved over time and that staff were working longer hours ashousing market activity had picked up.  In the constructionsector, some contacts expressed concerns that spare capacitycould diminish quickly in the event of a sustained upturn indemand as supply chain capacity had been eroded over timeand some skills had moved into other sectors, though mightreturn with a lag.Costs and prices
Labour costs
The rate of increase in labour costs per employee was reportedto be little changed on the previous year ( Chart 4 ), with
settlements continuing to be centred around 2% in recentmonths.  Outside engineering, IT or the oil and gas industry,little upwards pressure was reported, with many employeesprepared to accept weak wage growth for employment given,for example, the ready availability of migrant labour and thevisibility of high unemployment even among graduates.  In anumber of cases, companies reported lower starting salariesand the increased use of A-level entrants instead of graduates,alongside a wider shift in mix towards more junior staff.Manufacturing wage inflation remained somewhat strongerthan in services, with fewer staff on pay freezes and a strongerbias reported towards performance or hours-related pay —components which had edged higher in recent months.Uncertainty remained about the ultimate effect ofauto-enrolment pensions on overall labour costs.
Non-labour costs
Annual inflation in material costs had edged lower, as globaldemand growth had eased ( Chart 5 ).  Many materials costs
were reported to be broadly flat on a year ago, with a numberof metals prices having fallen and with recent declines in oilprices expected to feed through to oil-intensive materials incoming months.  The main exception to that pattern remainedfood price inflation, which had been boosted by the effects ofpoor weather conditions on UK yields.  Some non-oil energycosts had risen further.  And the price of some constructionmaterials, such as speciality bricks and aggregates, had risensharply as house builder demand had picked up.  Inflation inimported finished goods remained moderate, if above that ofraw materials ( Chart 5 ).  Price rises reflected the effects of
sterling’s depreciation around the turn of the year andincreases in production costs in some emerging markets.However, those upward pressures were being offset to some4

extent by the effects on import prices of weak demand in the
euro area.
Output prices and margins
The rate of inflation in manufacturers’ output prices hadremained subdued.  Some manufacturers reported being ableto raise prices in the face of cost increases, but generally thoseincreases at best protected existing margins.  However,profitability for the sector overall was reported to have edgedhigher.  Some niche manufacturers had been able to raiseprices as improved conditions had allowed them to exit lowmargin work and for some producers higher output had led toa decline in unit costs.  Business service price inflationremained low, though in some cases business conditions hadallowed some long-delayed pass-through of earlier costincreases to be made.  That, alongside reports of a slight
increase in productivity as output in the sector gradually rose,had allowed profitability to edge higher.  An Agents’ survey ofcompanies’ margins indicated that margins were slightly lowerthan normal, albeit by less than in the survey a year earlier (seepage 6).
Consumer prices
Retail goods and services price inflation had been unchanged.Food prices were said to be pushing up on inflation, thoughinflation in other goods prices was often reported to besubdued.  For example, clothing and footwear prices wereexpected to be broadly flat through to next year and, while listprices on new cars were said to be up, transaction prices paidby the customer were flat to falling after the effects offorecourt discounts.  On-line competition was seen asconstraining future non-food price rises more generally.  Andsome contacts’ expectations of future goods price inflationhad edged down with a recent stabilisation of the exchangerate and as consumer demand outturns had disappointedexpectations.  Services price inflation remained higher than forgoods prices, partly reflecting increases in administrative andregulated prices, such as those in social housing and publictransport.  Some contacts also reported price rises in theleisure sector alongside some greater demand, as well as inrestaurant prices as food price rises were passed through.More generally, outside some luxury sectors, contacts reportedwidespread discounting and difficulty in passing through priceincreases against a backdrop of tight consumer disposableincomes.

–Chart 5 Input costsAgents’ survey on profit margins
To help assess possible future upwards pressure on inflation
from companies’ efforts to raise profitability, the Agentsconducted a survey to investigate corporate profit margins.The Agents asked how current operating profit margins(defined as operating profit as a proportion of turnover)compared to normal (defined as the pre-crisis long-termaverage).  Where margins were below normal, respondentswere asked whether margins were sustainable and how long itwould take before they returned to normal.  The survey alsoexplored how margins had changed over the past year andwere expected to change in the coming year, the main driversfor changes, and the sensitivity of prices to changes indemand.  A total of 406 companies responded to the survey,with turnover of over £61 billion.  The sample was more heavilyweighted in retail and consumer services, and less in businessservices, relative to sectoral contributions to output in theeconomy as a whole.
Weighting the results by turnover, 45% of respondents
described their margins as below normal ( Chart A ), yielding a
modest negative net balance, albeit a smaller one than foundin a comparable survey in 2012 (for an unmatched sample).Within the sample, larger firms’ margins were closer to normalthan those of smaller firms and exporting firms reported thattheir margins were, on balance, higher than normal.
The majority of the subset of firms reporting below-normal
margins considered their margins to be sustainable given, forexample, current low levels of interest rates on debt.  But mostalso thought a return to normal margins would occur over thenext one to three years, and only 8% envisaged margins neverreturning to normal ( Chart B ). 
Around half of all respondents reported a rise in margins over
the past year, with a greater share of larger firms (defined asturnover over £50 million) than smaller firms indicating anincrease.  All sectors, other than manufacturing, appeared tobe reporting less of a squeeze on margins this year.  As in the
2012 survey, profits in construction were reported to beparticularly weak compared with normal.
Over the next year, a similar slight improvement in margin was
expected overall, as positive expectations from manufacturing,retail and business services contacts outweighed ananticipated narrowing of margins in consumer services andconstruction.
Among the drivers of changes, productivity gains were cited
more frequently than price as raising margins over both thepast and coming year ( Chart C ).  That was also the case when
looking only at the subset of firms expecting to increase theirmargins, though for these firms the net balances expectingproductivity and price increases to raise margins was higherthan for the sample overall.  Other factors acting to increasemargins included a reduction in fixed costs per unit as outputrose, a shift in companies’ output mix towards higher marginproducts, and the introduction of new products, which oftencarried higher margins than existing outputs.  Over 90% ofrespondents judged their output prices to be mildly or highlysensitive to changes in demand, broadly evenly split betweenthose two categories.
