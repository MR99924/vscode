March 2010Demand
Consumption
Retail spending had been volatile in recent months.  The
inclement weather had depressed footfall and sales duringJanuary, and the temporary cut in VAT, which had boostedspending during late 2009, had been reversed.  Abstractingfrom these transitory influences, the Agents sensed that theunderlying trend in retail sales growth appeared to ease backslightly through early 2010.  As a result, the Agents’ scoreswere unchanged on the month, following significant increasesover the past year ( Chart 1 ).  Many contacts expressed
concerns that the slowdown in sales might reflect the start ofa weaker underlying trend in spending, prompted by householdexpectations of future tax rises, and concerns about future jobsecurity.
The Agents reported that growth in consumer services
turnover had picked up slightly in recent months, although itremained weaker than growth in retail spending ( Chart 1 ).  The
snowy weather depressed sales during early 2010, particularlyamong pubs, hotels and restaurants.  But other sectors faredbetter.  For example, forward bookings of summer holidayshad reportedly picked up.
Housing market
The gradual recovery in the number of housing markettransactions reported through the second half of 2009appeared to have slowed in recent months.  Again, part of thathad reflected transitory influences.  The cold weatherdepressed viewings and enquiries in early 2010.  And in someparts of the United Kingdom, the reintroduction of stamp dutyon properties valued between £125,000 and £175,000 inJanuary 2010 had reportedly boosted transactions towards theend of 2009, and reduced them subsequently.  
Abstracting from these temporary factors, the Agents’
contacts reported little underlying change in the main factorsinfluencing the housing market.  The availability of mortgagefinance continued to constrain demand, particularly among
first-time buyers.  And the supply of new instructions alsoremained low.  Overall, the imbalance between demand andsupply had persisted, leading to modest upward pressure onprices.  
Business investment
Investment intentions remained subdued, as the significantmargin of spare capacity, uncertainty about future demandand the restricted availability of credit continued to weigh on contacts’ spending plans.  But investment intentions didpick up a little, which combined with weak year-on-yearcomparators, motivated further increases in the Agents’ scores(Chart 2 ).  Notwithstanding the impact of the lower exchange
rate on the price of imported capital, some contacts reportedthat capital equipment was cheap, and were keen to takeadvantage to invest at low cost in advance of the recovery.But, as in previous months, spending plans were mostlytargeted at improving efficiency rather than increasingcapacity.
Exports 
Export volumes continued to pick up slightly.  Althoughexternal demand had recovered further, growth in the United Kingdom’s major trading partners had been sluggish.For example, while demand had recovered strongly in Asianeconomies, enquiries and orders from the euro area and theUnited States remained subdued.  The lower exchange rateappeared to have provided only a limited boost to exportvolumes so far, with the majority of exporters using the fall insterling to rebuild or boost margins rather than expand output.Looking ahead, contacts expected a rise in exports during 2010(see box). 
Inventories
As had been the case throughout 2009 Q4, the majority ofcontacts reported that stocks were close to desired levels.Looking ahead, businesses were planning to operate with lower2

stock levels (relative to sales) than in the past, given their
desire to conserve working capital, and their expectations ofsubdued demand growth.
Output
Business services
There were further signs of a pickup in demand for professionaland financial services which, coupled with weak year-agocomparators, led to a further rise in the Agents’ scores (Chart 3 ).  Legal and accountancy firms continued to report
improvements in demand.  Advertising and marketing, whichhad been cut sharply during 2009, also picked up a little.  Andcommercial property contacts also reported an increase indemand for their services, notably from overseas investorslooking to capitalise on low valuations and the weak currency.  
The recovery in other business services output had been more
patchy.  Haulage and distribution firms, who experiencedmarked reductions in output during 2009, reported thatdemand had stabilised, or even increased slightly in recentmonths.  But corporate spending on hotels and travelcontinued to decline, and demand for business conferencesremained subdued.
Manufacturing
The modest recovery in manufacturing output continuedthrough early 2010.  Some of that improvement reflected agradual rise in exports (see above), but it also reflectedstronger demand for food and consumer goods.  Reports fromthose manufacturers servicing the construction industry,however, remained very downbeat.
Construction
Output in the construction sector remained extremelydepressed.  Activity continued to be supported primarily by thepublic sector, where a number of projects had been broughtforward and where, despite the expected fiscal consolidation,there had been only isolated incidents of projects beingcancelled or postponed.  In private sector construction, there
had been some recovery in residential homebuilding, but thatwas offset by weakness in commercial property construction,where the pipeline of projects continued to dwindle.  Overall,contacts were very downbeat about prospects for the sector,with a number expecting the trough in activity to come in2011.
Credit conditions
Credit conditions remained tight, although the availability ofcorporate credit continued to improve through early 2010.But, as had been the case for some months, reports ofimproved access to bank finance were more common amonglarger businesses than their smaller counterparts.  And despitethe improved availability of credit, spreads and fees remainedelevated relative to pre-crisis levels.  That, combined withcorporates’ continued desire to repay debt, meant thatdemand for finance remained weak.  The availability of tradecredit insurance had also improved a little in recent months,with some providers taking solace from the stability ofinsolvencies so far through 2010.  But looking ahead, contactsremained concerned about increases in bad debts.  
Employment
There was little change in businesses’ employment intentionsover the past month.  Most manufacturing and service sectorcontacts expected employment to remain broadly stable(Chart 4 ).  Redundancy programmes were reported to have
been largely completed, and many businesses expected tomeet any increase in demand by reinstating ‘normal’ workinghours, or through the use of temporary staff, rather than byincreasing recruitment.  The outlook for employment in theconstruction and public sectors (neither of which are capturedby the Agents’ scores), was bleaker, with a number of publicsector redundancies already announced.Chart 3 Services output

–Over the next six monthsCapacity utilisation
The economy continued to operate with a significant margin
of spare capacity.  Nonetheless, labour utilisation rose gently,as businesses met increases in demand using their existingworkforce.  The majority of businesses recruiting additionalstaff reported little difficulty in filling any vacancies.  
Costs and prices
Labour costs
The outlook for pay and labour costs remained subdued,consistent with the findings of last month’s special survey.Many businesses were planning pay freezes, with somechoosing to reward employees’ effort and loyalty using one-offbonus payments.  Most other companies were planning tomake small positive settlements (0%–2%). 
Total labour costs were reported to have picked up slightly,
however.  For many manufacturing companies, that reflectedthe reinstatement of shifts and hours that were cut this timelast year, as the scale of the recession became apparent.  But italso reflected increasing pension costs, with many definedbenefit pension funds in deficit following falls in gilt yields.
Non-labour costs
Materials costs rose over the past month, motivating a furtherrise in the Agents’ score ( Chart 5 ).  Commodity prices were
reported to have risen, reflecting both a rise in world demandand an earlier reduction in global supply capacity.  Metalsprices (aluminium and steel) had risen, as had the prices of oiland associated derivatives (such as plastics).  The Agents’contacts also reported higher imported finished goods prices,driven by the lagged effects of the sterling depreciation.  Utilityprices, however, were reportedly lower, as businessesrenegotiated their rates based on 2009 wholesale energyprices, which were significantly lower than those prevailing in2008.
Output prices
Manufacturing output prices ticked up slightly over the month.Together with weak year-on-year comparators, that led to afurther slight increase in the Agents’ score ( Chart 5 ).  For a
number of contacts, recent increases in output prices reflectedtheir efforts to rebuild margins, which had been squeezedfollowing the sharp rise in input costs during 2008.  The desireto preserve margins was reported to have largely offset theimpact of widespread spare capacity on manufacturing outputprices.
In the services sector, business-to-business prices remained
under intense downward pressure.  In part, that reflected thelimited incidence of insolvencies, which had supported supply,contributing to the decline in services output prices.  Somecontacts, however, noted that the rate of deflation in servicesoutput prices had begun to stabilise.
Consumer prices
The Agents’ score for annual retail goods price inflation picked up further, reflecting the rise in VAT, increases in petrol prices and some continuing impact of the lower levelof sterling on the prices of imported consumer goods.  The risewas also driven by less widespread discounting than a yearearlier:  retailers had purchased sufficiently little stock that notmuch discounting was required to clear it.  Annual retailservices price inflation also rose, albeit to a lesser degree.4

2005 06 07 08 09 10–+Agents’ survey on exports and export pricing
The sharp and synchronised fall in global economic activity
bore down on UK exports during 2009.  Looking ahead, thepath of UK exports will depend on the timing and strength ofthe global recovery, and on exporters’ reactions to changes inthe sterling effective exchange rate, which had fallen byaround 25% since the middle of 2007.  Over time, thatdepreciation should encourage an increase in exports, bymaking UK goods and services more competitive relative totheir foreign counterparts.  To date, however, UK exportersappear to have used much of the fall in sterling to boost theirmargins, rather than cutting foreign currency prices andincreasing the volume of goods and services they export.  
This month, the Agents asked export contacts about their
experiences over 2009 relative to 2008, and about theirexpectations for exports in 2010 relative to 2009.  225businesses responded to the survey, with the sample heavilyskewed towards goods exporters.  All figures shown areweighted by export turnover.
A significant number of contacts confirmed that the value of
their sterling exports had fallen significantly during 2009(Chart A ).  The declines were more acute among goods
exporters than their service sector counterparts.
Looking ahead, businesses expected the sterling value of their
exports to rise a little during 2010.  Consistent with recentreports from the Agents, those businesses who primarilyexport to Asia and the Middle East were more optimistic than those who mainly export to the United States and theeuro area ( Chart B ).
On prices, the vast majority of contacts reported that they had
left foreign currency export prices unchanged over the pastyear.  Looking ahead, a similar proportion of contacts expectedto make little change to their foreign currency export prices
during 2010 ( Chart C ).  
Many contacts ascribed the stability of their export prices,
despite the steep sterling depreciation, to the globalisation ofsupply chains and rise in imported raw material prices, whichhad put upward pressure on their costs over the past year.And a number of contacts reported that they were producinghigh value-added goods for niche markets, such that demandfor their products was relatively inelastic, limiting the benefitof cutting foreign currency export prices.  
Other contacts offered different explanations for the stability
in their foreign currency export prices, including:  a desire torebuild cash flow and profit, rather than gaining market share;the prevalence of long-term pricing contracts, agreed prior tothe sterling depreciation;  and the lack of sufficient (trade)credit, which rendered the risk of expanding into new marketsprohibitive, particularly for small and medium-sizedbusinesses.
