March 2014Demand
Consumption
Annual growth in the value and volume of retail sales had
increased slightly over the past three months ( Chart 1 ).
Contacts reported a steady start to the year overall, albeit withdiffering trends in durable and non-durable consumption.Food sales values were reported to be weak, albeit in partrelated to falling prices due to intensive promotional activity.In contrast, contacts reported gradual strengthening inhousehold durables sales growth, attributed in part to astronger housing market.  New car sales had started the yearstrongly, supported in part by leasing finance that was seen asreadily available at low cost.  Dealers were also attempting toboost sales by encouraging the early replacement of carspreviously bought on monthly payment plans.  The wetweather had had a limited impact so far on retail sales outsidethe most affected areas.  Consumer services turnover growthhad also edged higher.  Consumers had become slightly morewilling to spend on leisure activities, with pubs, restaurantsand hotels reporting increased demand.  Demand for rail travelhad also risen, although some services had been affected byline closures following flooding.  Some indoor attractions, suchas cinemas and bowling, had traded exceptionally well in thewet weather and forward holiday bookings were reported to bestrong.
Housing market
The recovery in housing market activity had continued at asteady pace, fuelled by improved mortgage availability forfirst-time buyers and growing household confidence.Transactions were substantially higher than a year ago acrossmost regions, albeit still below pre-recession levels.  Estateagents’ instructions to sell had risen, but there had remained ashortage of properties for sale on the secondary market.  Thathad, so far, mainly affected activity levels rather than prices.House price inflation had continued to vary across theUnited Kingdom, with double-digit percentage rises in Londoncontrasting with more modest growth in most other regions.Business investment
Investment intentions had continued to point to moderategrowth in capital expenditure in the year ahead.Manufacturers’ intentions had picked up a little, with anincreasing number of contacts looking to invest in newcapacity, in addition to ongoing spending to improve efficiencyor productivity.  Some firms, though, were cautious aboutmaking substantial expenditures until they were more certainthat the recovery in demand would be sustained.  Investmentin commercial real estate was picking up, including outsideLondon, although much of the focus was on enhancement ofexisting stock rather than on new building projects.  In retail,that reflected an overhang of existing space, whereas in officeand industrial markets, rental levels and lease terms wereoften said not yet to have recovered sufficiently to make newbuilding viable.  Plant hire firms had increased investment onthe back of a strong pickup in demand from the constructionsector.  An Agents’ survey on the Bank’s forward guidance(page 4) indicated the policy had had a positive influence oncompanies’ investment intentions.
Exports
Manufacturing export volumes growth had picked up further.Sales to continental Europe had remained broadly flat, thoughon a forward-looking basis were showing some slight signs ofimprovement.  Contacts reported moderate growth in exportsto the United States overall and growth to emergingeconomies had remained firm, with increases in market shareoffsetting a modest slowing of growth in some markets, suchas Brazil.  Growth continued to be concentrated in highervalue-added products, such as those in the oil and gas,automotive and branded goods subsectors.  Services exportsgrowth had persisted, with IT services reporting strengtheningoverseas demand, alongside continued robust growth amongenergy and engineering consultancy firms.  Overcapacity in theglobal mining industry, coupled with softening demand fromChina, had dampened export demand for some relatedservices, however.  Rising investment in UK property, togetherwith company acquisitions by overseas investors, wereboosting demand for related services.  Inbound tourism andbusiness travel to the United Kingdom were up on a yearearlier.
Output
Business services
Growth in business services turnover had edged a little higher(Chart 2 ).  In financial and professional services,
transaction-related work was being supported by the pickup ininitial public offering and mergers and acquisitions activity, thelatter fuelled largely by domestic companies’ cash reserves andforeign buyers.  There was also strength in demand for taxplanning, corporate finance, consultancy and due diligence.Recruitment consultants, training providers and advertisingfirms had benefited from rising confidence and a loosening of2

budgets among clients.  Strengthening occupier and
investment demand for commercial real estate, spreadingbeyond London, had increased demand for a range of relatedservices.  The rate of growth in other business services had alsoedged up, though activity levels were often uneven acrosssubsectors and geographical areas.  The strongest growth wasstill being reported in IT services, driven by demand forsoftware and system upgrades, consultancy, mobiletechnology and web-based infrastructure.  The recovery inconstruction was bolstering workloads for contacts in a varietyof subsectors, including hauliers, builders’ merchants, andplant hire firms.  Corporate travel bookings and conferencinghad remained well below pre-crisis levels, but hoteliersreported signs of improvement as companies started toincrease discretionary spending.
Manufacturing
Output for the domestic market had continued to growsteadily overall ( Chart 2 ), although the experience across
subsectors was mixed.  Output growth was strongest formanufacturers of construction products, particularly thoserelated to house building.  Automotive and energy supplychains continued to grow robustly on the back of strongdomestic and overseas sales.  Demand for non-durables andtextiles had remained flat, however.  Companies supplying thepublic sector, especially defence, had continued to reportsubdued demand conditions.
Construction
Construction output growth had risen further ( Chart 2 ).
House building had remained the primary driver of growth.Improved sentiment in the commercial property sector outsideLondon had, so far, principally led to an increase inrefurbishment projects rather than new building.  But plans forlarger projects were reported to be taking shape and somecontacts had started to talk about the start of a return ofspeculative development in a few hotspots.  Investor appetitefor student accommodation schemes had remainedundiminished.  The wet weather had adversely affected output
in some areas, but nationally the picture was one of morefavourable conditions for builders than a year ago, given theheavy snowfall at that time.  Contacts expected a sharp pickupin repair and reconstruction work in flood-hit areas in thecoming months.
Credit conditions
Credit conditions had eased slightly further.  Demand forcorporate credit had edged higher, although a significantproportion of contacts were reported to be using cash reservesrather than credit for capital expenditure projects andacquisitions.  Banks were said to be actively seeking to growtheir loan books, primarily among larger firms, or those withstrong balance sheets.  Most large and medium-sizedborrowers reported little difficulty in raising finance atreasonable cost through bank or non-bank sources.  Conditionshad remained tight for smaller firms, though, and some bankswere still reported to be averse to lending to certain sectors,such as construction, retail and hospitality.  Availability offunding for commercial property companies had improved, butwas still reported to be restraining activity for somedevelopers.  Asset finance availability appeared to be good,with no reports of contacts struggling to finance machinery.Non-bank finance had continued to grow in importance as asource of corporate credit.
Employment
Employment intentions over the next six months pointed tofurther modest headcount growth, albeit at a rate below thatof output growth, as contacts sought productivity gains tohelp meet rising demand.  That said, some companies seekingto increase the recruitment of trainees in response to skillsshortages anticipated a temporary negative impact onproductivity as skills were developed.  For some contacts, therewas scope to cope with higher activity levels by increasinghours worked rather than employment.  Headcount growthappeared strongest in professional services, IT andconstruction, but was being dampened in some manufacturingfirms by consolidation of factories aimed at cost reduction.Recruitment difficulties had edged up, and were marginallyabove normal ( Chart 3 ).  Skills shortages were most
pronounced in IT, engineering and construction, but there wereincreasing reports of a spread to other roles, such as seniormanagement positions.
Capacity utilisation
Capacity utilisation had remained close to normal, thoughthere was evidence of a small, but growing, number ofconstraints emerging as demand continued to improve.  Thosewere most evident in housing-related construction, where54321012345

construction outputAgents’ survey on forward guidance
In August 2013, the Monetary Policy Committee provided
guidance about the future path of policy, stating its intentionnot to raise Bank Rate at least until the unemployment ratefell to a threshold of 7%, provided this did not entail materialrisks to either price or financial stability.  In order to gauge howwell businesses understood the Bank’s policy of forwardguidance and whether the policy had affected their confidenceand behaviour, the Agents ran a poll of their principal contactsin January 2014, with a total of 1,574 responses.
(1)The main
results from this survey were contained in a box in theFebruary 2014 Inflation Report .
(2)Some care is required in
interpreting the survey results given that Agents’ contactsmight be expected, on average, to have a better understandingof monetary policy than for the corporate sector as a whole.Nonetheless, the results suggest that companies have a goodunderstanding of forward guidance and that the policy has hada positive effect on confidence, spending plans and staffing.
The survey asked companies how well a number of statements
described the key message of the policy.  Some nine in tenrespondents agreed with the correct description of forwardguidance ( Chart A ).  Of those, around half indicated that they
knew all alternative descriptions were incorrect or had‘no view’ on the alternatives.  Less than 10% of respondentsstated that they didn’t know what forward guidance is, or thatthey found the policy unclear.
Contacts were asked how forward guidance had changed their
views of future Bank Rate.  Almost half of respondentsexpected Bank Rate to remain at current low levels for longerthan if the guidance were not in place ( Chart B ), with just
under 20% who, conversely, expected Bank Rate to rise soonerthan if the guidance was not in place.  Nearly a third ofrespondents reported that their views were not affected by thepolicy.  Overall, a net balance of nearly 30% of respondentsexpected Bank Rate to remain at low rates for longer than they
would have in the absence of guidance.
Some two thirds of respondents thought the next change in
Bank Rate would be an increase in 12–24 months’ time, withthe rest of respondents split between an increase in6–12 months (19%) and an increase after two years (13%).Only 1% of respondents believed that interest rates would risewithin 1–6 months.
The survey asked about the effect from the policy guidance on
contacts’ confidence about near-term (one to two year)prospects for the economy.  A net balance of just over 70% ofcompanies reported a positive effect ( Chart C ), with 12%
saying the policy had made them much more confident.4

had been brought back on line only gradually.  A growing, butstill small, minority of manufacturing companies wereincreasing physical capacity as they approached full capacity.Utilisation in services had edged up a little on the month.Professional services firms were increasing headcount inresponse to growing demand, although there were someexpectations that mergers and acquisitions activity mightincrease effective capacity through greater efficiency.  Slack inthe economy was often reported to be concentrated amongconsumer services firms, where some retailers wereconsolidating floor space and redirecting resources intomulti-channel operations, such as ‘click and collect’.Costs and prices
Labour costs
Labour costs per employee had continued to grow moderately.Pay settlements had remained muted in the majority of cases,albeit with fewer pay freezes than in recent years.  However,there were some reports of concerns about pay pressuresstarting to build.  For example, many contacts reported havingto pay more than they had expected to attract new recruitsand a few had brought forward awards or made specific awardsto retain key staff.  For the most part, though, emerging skillsshortages had led to targeted increases in pay rather than anygeneral increase.  Variable elements of remuneration, such ascommission, bonuses and profit-related pay had also startedto increase alongside rising activity.  Total labour costs peremployee had continued to grow faster than pay because ofthe ongoing impact of auto-enrolment into pension schemes.
Non-labour costs
Materials cost inflation had eased, with costs little changed ona year earlier.  That had reflected a weakening of commodityprices, with fuel prices in particular, having fallen.  The majorexception to that pattern had remained constructionmaterials, where supply shortages had led to increased prices.Contacts continued to express concern about the level, if notthe growth, of energy costs.  Inflation in the costs of importedgoods had also fallen back.  Some food processors and otherimporters had reported a weakening of import prices recentlyas a result of the appreciation of sterling.  For others, however,a tendency to order up to twelve months ahead and theprevalence of hedging contracts would delay the pass-throughof the recent appreciation.  Downwards pressure on some543210123

Output prices and margins
Manufacturing output price inflation had edged down, withprices remaining slightly higher than a year ago.  Easingcommodity prices and strong competition had continued toput downwards pressure on output price inflation for manycontacts.  Output price rises among construction productmanufacturers and reports of increasing pricing power amongsome producers of highly specialised products were exceptionsto that pattern.  Business services price inflation had edgedhigher, continuing a gentle upwards trend seen over the pastyear.  Price increases had continued to be contained bycompetition, particularly within some ‘commoditised’ areas.But resistance to gentle price rises from customers wasreported to be easing for some contacts, and increasingvolumes had enabled some contacts to skew their outputtowards higher margin work.  Changes in pricing structures hadimproved fee incomes in some professional services.  Overallprofitability had edged up further for both manufacturing andservices, due to a combination of higher volumes, easing costpressures and efficiency gains.
Consumer prices
Consumer goods price inflation had continued to slow(Chart 4 ).  Food price inflation had abated further, reflecting
weaker world commodity prices, the recent appreciation ofsterling, and the effect of heavy discounting by supermarkets.An increasing use of price comparison websites was reported
to be restricting the scope for price increases for some othergoods.  Vehicle fuel prices were broadly flat on the year before.Retail services price inflation had eased slightly, but by lessthan for goods prices ( Chart 4 ).  A slight improvement in
discretionary spending was resulting in a gentle increase inprice inflation for some holidays and leisure attractions.  But anumber of inflation-linked price increases had been lower thanin the previous year (eg public transport fares, some utilitycompany charges).  Private housing rental growth had showedsome signs of easing off as owner occupation picked up.  And competition for limited stocks of homes on the secondary market had put downward pressure on someestate agents’ fees.6
