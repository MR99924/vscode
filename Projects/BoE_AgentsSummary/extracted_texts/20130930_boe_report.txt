September 2013Demand
Consumption
Annual growth in the value of retail sales and consumer
services had risen ( Chart 1 ), largely reflecting growth 
in sales volumes.  That partly reflected a run of good weather, though contacts also reported a slight increase in underlying consumer confidence and willingness to spend,notwithstanding tight disposable incomes.  Demand hadincreased for seasonal and home-improvement goods, as wellas for a range of leisure and outdoor attractions, restaurantmeals and domestic travel.  Growth in new car sales hadremained strong, supported by finance deals that allowed forlow monthly payment schedules, though some contacts wereconcerned about the extent to which recent sales levels weresustainable.  
Housing market
Housing market activity had risen further, both in terms ofenquiries and transactions.  In the new-build market,improving conditions were partly ascribed to the effects of theHelp to Buy scheme (applying to England only) and acontinued improvement in mortgage availability.  Risingdemand for new and existing homes was reported to beconcentrated among first and second-time buyers and buy-to-let investors.  Transactions for more expensiveproperties remained more subdued, in part reflecting highlevels of stamp duty, though were also starting to increase.Estate agents and house builders reported that housingdemand was running ahead of the available supply of existingor newly built homes, leading to rising house priceexpectations. 
Business investment
Investment intentions had edged higher in the services sector,though continued to point to modest growth in capitalspending overall.  Across manufacturing and services,investment had remained dominated by smaller-scaleefficiency-enhancing or capital replacement expenditures, with
little large-scale capacity expansion.  In services, investment inIT had increased as businesses upgraded aging systems ordeveloped e-commerce platforms.  In addition, spending onpremises refurbishment and on the replacement of haulagevehicles had risen, the latter ahead of the introduction of newemissions regulations.  Within manufacturing, investmentspending remained strongest in export industries, such asautomotive and civil aerospace production.  Capital spendingin energy extraction and utilities had remained relativelyrobust and the outlook for construction investment hadimproved.  
Exports
A gradual increase in manufacturing exports growth hadcontinued ( Chart 2 ), with demand rising across a range of
markets — particularly in Asia and parts of the Middle East —and with some signs that euro-area demand was starting tostabilise.  Manufacturing exports growth remainedconcentrated in products for the oil and gas industry, premiumbrands with a broad international reach, high value-addedniche products, or within the civil aerospace and automotiveindustries.  Rising growth in services exports was reported,often related to overseas energy production or constructionprojects.  Services exports were also reported to be rising as aresult of increased inbound tourism. 
Output
Business services
Growth in business services turnover on a year earlier hadedged higher ( Chart 2 ), though the annual rate of growth
remained below its long-term average.  A range of advisorywork was said to be rising, reflecting growing activity aroundcorporate, commercial property and land transactions, and agreater focus among companies on strategic direction orraising productivity.  Recruitment agencies reported risingturnover alongside increased economic activity.  Growth in2

turnoverother business services was somewhat slower than for
professional and financial services, but had also edged up.That partly reflected some increase in warehouse anddistribution activity.  Continued growth in the turnover of ITand outsourced services providers was reported, as companiessought to improve efficiency and reduce costs.  
Manufacturing
Annual growth in manufacturing output for the domesticmarket had edged marginally higher ( Chart 2 ), and sentiment
about future demand was gradually improving.  Growthremained strong in the automotive and civil aerospace sectors, as well as in the oil and gas supply chain, often linked to export markets.  Output of a range of constructiongoods was reported to have risen alongside increased housebuilding.  There were also reports of rising production fortransport infrastructure.  Output in some seasonal and home-improvement goods had picked up with improvedweather.  The printing sector remained weak, though somecontacts reported a gradual improvement in orders asspending on marketing started to rise.
Construction
Construction output had continued to strengthen ( Chart 3 ).
House builders reported increasing new-build activity inresponse to rising demand, which was feeding through toactivity along the construction supply chain.  Constructionactivity in utilities and transport infrastructure also remainedrelatively robust.  There were reports of rising activity relatedto increased refurbishment spending by some consumer-facingservices.  Public sector construction activity was reported to besteady, and concentrated in smaller-scale education andhealth projects.  But private sector commercial developmentoutside of London remained at low levels.  Credit conditions
Credit availability had been little changed in recent months.Competition among lenders was reported to have increased,which had led the price of credit to edge down further.  But forsmall businesses with few assets or those operating in riskiersectors, the availability of bank finance remained tight outsideof asset finance or invoice discounting.  Demand for bankfinance remained subdued, notwithstanding an increase inbusiness confidence.  For large companies, that partly reflectedthe easy availability and cheap price of capital market finance.More generally, many companies reported that they wereseeking to reduce their reliance on banks or were alreadyholding sufficient funds internally.  However, there was someincrease in reports of pressure on cash flow among smallercompanies, often reflecting larger customers’ extendedpayment times.  
Employment 
Employment in the economy was reported to be rising onlymodestly ( Chart 4 ), and by less than output, so that
productivity was gradually rising.  Contacts often reported thatthey expected their existing employees to become moreproductive as demand rose or that they were waiting for sparelabour capacity to be more fully utilised before increasingemployment.  Employment intentions were weakest inconsumer services.  Contacts in that sector reported that,having pared staff numbers back to the minimum, their initialreaction to increased demand would be an increase in averagehours worked rather than heads.  Employment intentions werestrongest in house building, reflected in growing reports ofrecruitment difficulties in that subsector, though it remainedunclear to what extent needs could be met from other sources,such as from those who had left the trade in recent years orfrom overseas.  Otherwise, skills shortages remained largelyconfined to IT and engineering.  Agents’ summary of business conditions September 2013 3

–Chart 4 Employment intentionsCapacity utilisation
Capacity utilisation was expected to increase a little over the
coming six months ( Chart 5 ) as output rose, but to remain
slightly below normal.  Most contacts across the economyreported that a moderate pickup in demand could be metreadily from existing capacity, particularly in some parts of thebusiness services sector where there remained scope to movestaff back from ‘business development’ roles and to reducetime spent winning business.  Within manufacturing, however,a small number of contacts in the automotive, aerospace andoil and gas supply chain reported capacity constraints.Contacts continued to express concerns about a shortage ofcapacity in the construction sector supply chain — such as forbricks — as demand increased, given that some plants hadpreviously been closed or mothballed in a way that would becostly or slow to reverse.  
Costs and prices
Labour costs
The annual rate of growth in labour costs per employee had remained broadly unchanged in recent months.  Inmanufacturing, pay awards often remained in the 2%–3%range, though some awards for specialist engineering skillswere higher.  Pay growth was reported to be more divergentwithin services than for manufacturing, with some reports ofpay growth strengthening in parts of professional services, butwith near-zero wage growth at many consumer services firms.An increased use of profit or merit-related pay in the economymore widely was leading some contacts to expect risingpressure on wages as demand recovered, and there were somelocalised reports of demand for a ‘catch up’ in pay after realwage cuts in recent years.  Some contacts reported having toincrease pay to fill vacant positions with experienced staff,alongside a slight rise in labour market churn.  However, othercontacts reported a continuing shift in the overall compositionof recruitment towards more junior staff to contain wage bill
growth.  Pay pressures were reported to be strengthening incertain house-building trades.  
Non-labour costs
Annual inflation in material costs had remained subdued.The main exceptions to that pattern were energy costs andsome food prices, which had continued to show significantinflation, though a softening of global agricultural commodityprices indicated easing pressures from the latter source.  Theprice of a number of construction materials had also risen,though some contacts reported being protected by annualcontracts.  Moderate inflation in imported finished goodsprices had continued as the depreciation of sterling since theend of 2012 continued gradually to pass through and as wagecosts in China had risen.  Those effects were expected tocontinue to place upward pressure on import prices incoming months as hedging unwound and new seasonal rangeswere ordered.
Output prices and margins
The rate of inflation in manufacturers’ and business services’output prices had remained subdued.  That reflected continuedweak input cost inflation combined with strong competitivepressures, though in some parts of professional and financialservices rising demand had allowed for some, often longdelayed, pass through of cost increases.  Profitability hadincreased slightly in both sectors, however, as businessvolumes had risen faster than costs and as some companies —in professional and financial services in particular — had beenable to shift towards more profitable lines of work.  Manycontacts expected a gentle rise in profitability to continue asdemand — and so productivity — gradually rose.  
Consumer prices
Consumer price inflation had remained moderate, albeitslightly higher than the previous month.  Earlier increases infood prices had continued to pass through to goods priceinflation, though the upward pressure from this source wasexpected to ease as global agricultural price falls started tofeed through.  But road fuel and energy prices had increasedand retailers reported shallower discounting of seasonalclothing and footwear than a year earlier, partly reflecting tightstock control.  New car prices remained flat, partly reflectingoverseas manufacturers targeting sales in the United Kingdomto offset weak demand on the continent.  Inflation inconsumer services prices was often reported to remain limitedoutside administered and regulated prices, though there werereports of a slight increase in pricing at some hotels,restaurants and visitor attractions.  More generally, contactscontinued to report that consumer demand remained pricesensitive, particularly for those whose customers’ incomeswere at the lower end of the earnings spectrum.  4
