This publication generally covers intelligence gathered from business contacts between March and mid‑April 2017.  It generally makes 
comparisons with activity and prices over the past three months on a year earlier.  The Update represents the aggregate view offered by the 
whole of the United Kingdom.  More information on the Bank’s Agencies can be found at www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/

May 2017 Update
•	Consumer spending growth had moderated in real terms, as spending power had been hit by higher prices.  But 
manufacturing export growth had risen.  That had mostly reflected the effects of the earlier decline in sterling.  
Investment intentions had also edged higher and were consistent with modest growth in spending over the year 
ahead.
•	In the labour market, recruitment conditions had tightened a little further, with skills shortages reported in a 
wider range of activities.  Labour costs growth had edged up in manufacturing.  But pay awards remained 
clustered around 2%–2½% across the economy.
•	Consumer goods price inflation had picked up markedly.  That largely reflected the effects of sterling’s earlier fall 
feeding through supply chains and into retail prices.  Consumer services price inflation had also increased, but to 
a lesser degree.
Consumer spending  growth had moderated in real terms, as 
spending power had been hit by higher prices, following the fall 
in sterling.  However, higher prices had been associated with 
slightly stronger retail sales growth in values terms ( Chart 1 ).
Business services  turnover growth had risen further to a 
moderate rate, following a dip after the EU referendum 
(Chart 2 ).  Mergers and acquisitions activity had picked up 
overall.  Services exports growth had been steady.
Manufacturing output  growth had strengthened ( Chart 3 ).  
Automotive and aerospace companies reported robust growth.  
More generally, activity growth in export supply chains had 
increased, reflecting the earlier fall in sterling.  A survey 
indicated that further growth in exports was expected over the 
coming year (see the box on page 2).
Construction output  growth had edged up, reflecting a 
strengthening of commercial development.
Investment intentions  were consistent with modest growth in 
spending over the next twelve months.  That reflected largely 
resilient demand growth.  Uncertainty continued to affect 
adversely some longer‑term spending plans.
Credit availability  had tightened slightly for small and 
medium‑sized companies, but financing remained readily 
available generally.  Corporate credit demand had remained 
muted.Investor demand for UK commercial real estate  had increased, 
particularly in some of the larger regional centres.  Rents were 
flat to modestly rising across the United Kingdom.
Housing market  activity had remained muted.  Both the 
demand for, and supply of, available property was subdued, 
but broadly in balance overall.
Capacity utilisation  was little changed and close to normal 
levels.  Excess capacity had continued in the retail sector.
Employment intentions  were little changed and pointed to 
very modest jobs growth over the coming six months ( Chart 4 ).  
Recruitment difficulties had tightened since the start of the 
year, with skills shortages reported in a wider range of activities.
Labour cost growth  had edged up in manufacturing.  Pay 
awards remained clustered around 2%–2½% across the 
economy.
Input cost  inflation had increased, due to rises in some global 
commodity prices and pass through of the earlier fall in 
sterling ( Chart 5 ).  Manufacturing output price inflation had 
risen further, as some earlier fixed‑price contracts and foreign 
exchange hedges expired.
Consumer goods price inflation  had risen sharply, as higher 
costs fed through ( Chart 6 ).  Inflation in retail services prices 
had also increased, but to a lesser degree.2 Agents’ summary of business conditions  May 2017 Update
Agents’ survey on exports
The Agents surveyed business contacts about expectations for 
the sterling value and volume of their UK exports over the next 
year.  Contacts were also asked which factors were likely to 
affect the sterling value of their exports over the coming year 
and in three years’ time, given the prospect of the 
United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union.  Around 
300 companies responded.  Results were weighted by export 
turnover and, for the headline results, reweighted by the goods 
and services shares of UK exports.
On balance, respondents expected an increase in both the 
sterling value and volume of exports over the coming year 
(Chart A ).  The net balance was stronger for values than 
volumes, implying that sterling export prices were expected to 
increase over the next twelve months.  In the case of export 
values, the expectations balance was more positive than in the 
Agents’ exports surveys over the past few years.  Both goods 
and services exporters expected export values and volumes to 
grow over the next twelve months, but the expectations of 
goods exporters were more positive.In terms of the factors affecting the sterling value of exports 
over the next twelve months, overseas demand was expected 
to provide the greatest support.  The fall in sterling over the 
past year, changes to respondents’ productive capacity in the 
United Kingdom and entry to new markets were also expected 
to increase export values ( Chart B ).  In contrast, exit from 
existing markets, changes in supply chains due to the prospect 
of the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union 
and uncertainty around the United Kingdom’s future trading 
arrangements were thought to exert a modest drag on export 
values over the year ahead.
Among the factors affecting future growth in sterling export 
values over the medium term, respondents expected the entry 
to new markets to be the most important factor.  Expected 
changes in tariff barriers and non‑tariff barriers were cited by 
respondents as negative influences in three years’ time 
(Chart B ).  The expected drags from trading uncertainty and 
supply chain changes were larger than over the next 
twelve months.  However, the overall expected negative 
influence on export values from market exit was similar at 
both the one and three years’ ahead time horizons.Values
