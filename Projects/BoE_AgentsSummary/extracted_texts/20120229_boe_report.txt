 Nominal consumer demand continued to grow slowly, with many consumers directing their spending towards
essential goods and services.
 The level of activity in the housing market remained subdued, but enquiry numbers had picked up in January.
 Investment intentions had softened further, although more recently a few contacts reported having resumed
projects that had been on hold, despite ongoing uncertainty about the outlook.
The pace of goods export growth continued to moderate.  That reflected slowing world demand growth,
particularly in the euro area, while demand in Asia remained robust.
The growth rate of turnover in business services had slowed further, reflecting weaker demand and downward
pressure on some fees, although some contacts recently noted a pickup in activity, as customers had becomea little less cautious.
 Manufacturing output for the domestic market continued to rise gradually.
The level of activity in the construction sector was slightly lower than a year earlier.  But the pace of
contraction had slowed a little.
Contacts reported that credit conditions had tightened in recent months, with both small and large
businesses noticing the change in the stance of lenders.
 Employment intentions in the private sector continued to soften, and suggested that employment was likely
to be broadly flat over the next six months.
 Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector had fallen back recently, reflecting both slowing growth in
demand and past investment and recruitment.  In the service sector too, weakening activity had caused sparecapacity to widen.
 Labour costs continued to grow at a moderate pace, with the outlook for pay settlements in 2012 broadly the
same as in 2011.
 Inflation in the price of imports of finished goods fell back further this month, suggesting that the recent
slowing in the pace of increase in raw material prices was starting to feed through.
Manufacturing output price inflation continued to moderate.  Manufacturers’ pricing power had weakened
following a reduction in domestic demand.
Annual retail goods inflation slowed further, but consumer services inflation remained elevated.

February 2012Demand
Consumption
The annual rate of nominal spending remained weak ( Chart 1 ).
Early reports suggested that the value of retail sales in Januarywas broadly flat on a year earlier.  Although, spending the yearbefore had been boosted by a bounceback in demand afterextreme weather conditions had disrupted shopping patterns.Nevertheless, retailers tended to report little sign of anyunderlying improvement in consumer confidence.  Consumerscontinued to direct their spending towards essential items suchas food and fuel and away from discretionary products,particularly durable goods.  And while retailers went into thepost-Christmas trading period having managed to sell much oftheir excess inventory, discounts were still considered to beessential to drive sales.  And some contacts felt that consumershad come to expect goods to be on promotion.
The rate of growth of demand for consumer services also
continued to slow.  Christmas spending had temporarilysupported some non-essential leisure services, such as pubs,bars and restaurants.  But trading conditions in January had sofar proved more difficult than usual, as households opted tostay at home.  In response, many contacts in the leisureindustry had begun to make greater use of promotions, suchas voucher-based deals on meals out.  Meanwhile, growth inspending on non-discretionary services such as transport,insurance and rents continued to be boosted by priceincreases.
Housing market
Contacts reported that there had been a modest increase inactivity in the housing market since the start of the year,beyond what was expected.  According to estate agents,enquiry levels in the secondary market had risen a little inJanuary.  Contacts suggested a number of reasons for this.Part of it represented catch-up from a particularly subduedend to last year, as well as awareness among buyers of theapproaching end to stamp duty relief.  Demand from
buy-to-let investors had also been growing, due to rising rentalyields.  Rents had been pushed up by growing demand,particularly from frustrated would-be first-time buyers, manyof whom remained unable to secure a mortgage.  For existinghomeowners, some had been unable to move because theyhad insufficient equity in their current property, while othershad become more cautious about trading up as a result ofconcerns about the outlook for the economy.
Business investment
Investment intentions continued to weaken, suggesting littlegrowth in spending on capital over the next twelve months(Chart 2 ).  But the softening in intentions remained gradual,
with little sign of an abrupt reappraisal of spending plans.  Andwhile heightened uncertainty about future demand had been aprime driver of the reduction in investment expectations, veryrecently, a few firms reported having restarted postponedinvestment, even though they remained uncertain about theoutlook.
In manufacturing there continued to be a divergence in
intentions between domestic and export-facing businesses.Those supplying the domestic market tended to be moreinclined to lower their investment plans, often reflectingweaker expectations for demand, particularly among thoseproducing goods for the construction and consumer sectors.In contrast, exporters were often planning to increase capacity,particularly in the aerospace, energy and agricultural sectors.In the service sector there was more widespread evidence of alowering in investment intentions, reflecting weak demandgrowth and a rising margin of slack.  And some of the largerretailers were scaling back their store expansion programmes.
Exports
Goods exports growth continued to slow, reflecting softeningworld demand, particularly in the euro area.  But some of thiswas thought to have been due to de-stocking in end markets,which some contacts believed was now coming to an end.2

And demand in emerging markets continued to grow steadily.
A number of contacts reported strong growth in areas such asaerospace, equipment for the energy industry and luxuryconsumer goods.  In the service sector, professional andfinancial services firms reported robust demand from emergingmarkets, especially for services related to oil and gasextraction, for instance in engineering consultancy.
Output
Business services
Business services turnover growth continued to slow, reflectingweaker demand and downward pressure on fees, particularlyamong accountancy and legal firms.  That had been driven inpart by the high degree of uncertainty about the outlook forthe economy.  And contacts in the financial sector had seen adecline in work on corporate transactions as companies putplans on hold.  But very recently, some contacts had reported apickup in activity, as clients adjusted to the high degree ofuncertainty and decided to go ahead with projects in spite ofit.  Contacts in corporate hospitality also reported a softeningin demand, and distribution companies had been relativelyquiet as retailers ran down stocks.
Manufacturing
The annual growth rate of manufacturing output for thedomestic market had fallen further this month, with reportsbecoming increasingly polarised.  Firms which were increasingoutput tended to be those supplying essential goods, or insupply chains for the export sector, for instance in foodproduction and high-tech industries.  But there was particularweakness from suppliers of goods destined for the domestichousehold and construction sectors.  Producers of goodsdestined for the public sector also reported falling orders, inpart a reflection of tighter procurement processes followingcuts in public sector spending.
Construction
Activity in the construction sector continued to contract butthe pace of decline appeared to have moderated.Underpinning this was a modest pickup in private demand, forinstance from the construction of new homes, projects in theutilities sector and commercial property in London.  Inaddition, a number of contacts had reported a spike in thenumber of solar panel installations in the run-up to thereduction in the feed-in tariff.  In the public sector, previouslycommissioned capital projects were expected to supportactivity for some months.  But as these came to an end, theytended not to be replaced by projects of a similar size, orsometimes not at all.  There was further evidence this monththat the pace of floor space expansion of some of the bignational retailers had slowed.Credit conditions
Contacts reported that credit conditions had tightenedrecently.  And that had been felt by both large and smallcompanies.  Larger firms and those with strong balance sheetsstill typically had reasonable access to credit.  But some largecontacts expected to make greater use of capital markets ifcredit conditions tightened further.  Smaller firms continued toreport that credit conditions were tight, with persistentpressure from banks to commit to asset backed forms oflending, rather than overdrafts, which contacts often preferred.Many firms remained focused on paying down existing debt.
Some contacts reported that the maturity of their borrowing
had shortened over the course of the recession, and as a resultrefinancing was required more often, taking up moremanagement time than in the past.  And recently, some firmshad experienced difficulties with syndicated loans, as Europeanlenders sought to withdraw from commitments, complicatingthe task of refinancing further.
Contacts reported a continued unwillingness by banks to lend
into sectors such as construction, consumer services andproperty, with some lenders acknowledging that these sectorswere essentially closed to new lending.  Where funds wereavailable for these sectors, banks had usually reduced loan tovalue ratios, or increased charges to reflect better theirperception of risk.
Employment
Employment intentions in the private sector continued toweaken, and suggested that employment was likely to bebroadly flat over the next six months ( Chart 3 ).  The
weakening outlook for activity had led many firms to sharpentheir focus on costs, with recruitment freezes becoming morecommonplace, and further steps taken to achieve productivitygains before adding to headcount.  But instances ofinvoluntary redundancies remained infrequent.

–Growth over the next six monthsChart 3 Employment intentionsIn the manufacturing sector, a weaker domestic outlook and
concerns for certain export markets had encouragedemployers to scale back recruitment plans, while in businessservices, spare capacity was opening up in many professionalservices firms, with an increase in the number of reports ofunderemployment among newly qualified staff.  Many firms inthis sector were attempting to rearrange resources to targetgrowth areas, and introducing non-replacement policies inothers.  There were expected to be further payroll reductions inthe banking industry.  In retailing, some additional jobs wouldcome from the expansion of the larger businesses, albeit at aslower pace of growth.  But many consumer-facing firms wereoften already at minimum staffing levels, and store closureswere expected to cause retail employment to fall overall.
Capacity utilisation
In the manufacturing sector capacity utilisation was, onaverage, around normal, but had fallen back somewhat inrecent months, reflecting both softer demand conditions andpast investment and recruitment.  Contacts reported thatcapacity utilisation was highest among exporters, especiallythose facing areas of robust growth, for instance, in theaerospace and automotive industries.  By contrast, thosesupplying domestic households and the construction sectortended to exhibit a much larger degree of slack.  In services,slowing activity had caused spare capacity to widen further.But contacts were responding more quickly than in the past,actively adjusting working arrangements to meet changes indemand.  For instance, some businesses in the retail sectorwere shortening their opening hours, while professionalservices firms often reported a reduction in the use of overtimeand temporary staff.
Costs and prices
Labour costs
Labour costs continued to grow at a moderate pace, with themajority of settlements between 2% and 3%.  Higher awardstended to be associated with formal wage agreements, orwhere pay was indexed to inflation through multi-year deals,although instances of these appeared to be more than offset bypay freezes.  Looking forward, the outlook for pay settlementsin 2012 was thought to be broadly the same as in 2011.  Therehad been some upward pressure on settlements due to risinglabour productivity and the need to retain key staff.  But thishad been broadly balanced by other factors, including lowerinflation expectations and reduced corporate profitability.Slower growth in profits was expected to lower bonuspayments in the manufacturing sector over the coming year.
Non-labour costs
Inflation in raw materials prices continued to slow, with a widerange of commodity prices either levelling off or declining.Although, for firms with forward contracts it would take sometime for these to feed through.  And contacts continued to
report significant increases in energy costs, and in the prices ofagricultural commodities.  Inflation in the price of imports offinished goods fell back further this month, reflecting softerworld demand growth and slowing inflation in raw materialprices, which suppliers were beginning to pass on.  Offsettingthat to some extent was the rising cost of production inemerging market economies, where wage growth wassometimes in double digits.  The Agents continued to hearreports of elevated inflation in the price of certain electricalcomponents as a result of flooding in Thailand, and somecontacts thought that supply chains might not fully recoveruntil the autumn.
Output prices
Manufacturing output price inflation had edged down on themonth ( Chart 4 ).  That was partly due to a fall in pricing
power, as demand growth had weakened.  It was also areflection of the slowing in the pace of increase in input costs,although some firms were reluctant to pass on pricereductions.  In business services, output price inflation hadfallen significantly in recent months, with contacts inprofessional services reporting further downward pressure onfees.  In the corporate hospitality and events industry fallingdemand had led to a rise in spare capacity, leading to somesizable last-minute discounts.
Consumer prices
The rate of retail goods inflation continued to fall back, withmost contacts expecting this to continue, helped in part byrecent announcements of future price reductions by some ofthe large energy providers.  Contacts maintained thatdiscounting was essential to induce consumers to spend, andthis was expected to continue for some time.  In services, therate of inflation remained elevated.  Despite evidence ofwidespread discounting, especially by suppliers ofnon-essential services, the prices of essential services andthose linked to inflation, such as rail fares, continued to risefairly quickly.4

–Chart 4 Manufacturing and services output pricesAgents’ survey on pay and labour costs
The Agents have conducted an annual pay survey since 1998,
asking contacts in the private sector about their expected paysettlements for the year ahead, and the key drivers of anychanges to growth in total labour costs per employee.  Thisyear 384 firms responded with a combined UK employment of538,000.
The average pay settlement for 2011 reported in this year’s
survey was 2.2% (the green diamond in Chart A ).  That was
more or less in line with the expectation for 2011 in theprevious year’s survey (the blue diamond for 2011).  Lookingforward, the average expected pay settlement for 2012 fromthis year’s survey was 2.1% (the red diamond).  That remainswell below pre-recession growth rates and suggests that therate of increase in pay will not pick up during 2012.
Responses to the survey suggest that average settlements are
expected to be slightly weaker for small firms (employingfewer than 250 staff) than larger ones ( Chart B ).  Most large
firms expected to make a pay award of between 2% and 3% in2012, whereas small and medium-sized firms tended to expectsettlements to lie between 1% and 3%, with a significantminority expecting pay freezes in 2012.
Only a very small net balance of respondents expected total
labour costs per employee to increase more rapidly in 2012than in 2011.  But there were some sizable opposing forces atplay.  Changes in productivity and increases in employerpension contributions were both expected to exert upwardpressure on growth in labour costs ( Chart C ).  Expectations of
upward pressure from changes in productivity were evident inresponses from all sectors, but were strongest in the
manufacturing sector.  Meanwhile, in a notable change fromthe previous year’s survey, inflation expectations were nolonger expected to put significant upward pressure on totallabour costs.  And weakening company profitability, lowerperformance-related pay and reductions in average hours wereall expected to slow growth in labour costs over the comingyear.  Firms also reported that they had little pricing powerand expected that to restrain growth in labour costs during2012.
