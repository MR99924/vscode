 Consumer goods sales during Christmas rose modestly on a year earlier, in line with retailers’ expectations.  Few
anticipated a pickup in growth in the near term given the headwinds facing the economy.  Growth in demand for
consumer services remained subdued.
There were tentative signs of a gradual increase in housing market activity , supported by reductions in mortgage
costs.  Some contacts thought that the Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS), along with some specific incentiveschemes, was providing a stimulus to house sales.  
 Corporate credit availability was gradually improving, though less so for smaller firms where conditions remained
tight.  There were some tentative signs of lender forbearance starting to wane in the commercial property market.
 Investment intentions continued to edge higher.
 Exports of goods were on average reported to be growing slowly on a year earlier, with weak euro area demand offset
by growth in other markets.
Modest growth in the output of business services had continued.
 Manufacturing output for the domestic market was reported to be broadly flat on a year earlier, with growth in some
‘high-tech’ areas offset by weakness in construction-related sectors.
 Construction output remained lower than a year ago.
 Employment intentions continued to edge higher in business services but declined for consumer services, partly
reflecting recent high street failures.
 Capacity utilisation remained a little below normal. 
The rate of growth in labour costs per employee edged higher.  Wage growth was expected to be little changed in
2013, though larger firms expected some upwards pressure on labour costs from pensions contributions.  
 Non-labour costs and finished import prices had continued to drift upwards.
 Output price inflation remained subdued, with competitive pressures preventing the full pass-through of previous
rises in input costs.  
The rate of consumer price inflation was reported to be unchanged.

February 2013Demand
Consumption
Subdued annual growth in the value of retail sales had
continued ( Chart 1 ). Contacts reported that sales over the
festive period were in line with their modest expectations.Within retail sales, online retailing had clearly outperformedthe rest of the market, showing robust growth.  Post-Christmas sales were reported to have started stronglybut to have fallen back more quickly than usual, in partreflecting lower levels of stock to clear due to tighter inventorycontrol.  Some retailers expected the adverse weather in lateJanuary to have hindered sales growth.  More generally, fewexpected consumption growth to pick up in the near termgiven concerns about job prospects and a squeeze ondisposable incomes.  One area of continued strength had beennew car sales, though some contacts questioned how long thatcould continue given a reliance on discounting. 
Growth in consumer services demand remained very modest
(Chart 1 ).  There were continued reports that demand for
‘bigger ticket’ leisure services — such as holiday and hotelbookings — was gently strengthening on a year earlier.  Butmany consumers were said to be restricting their spending onlower-value ‘discretionary’ purchases, such as spending atrestaurants and bars.  A continued structural shift in demandtowards public transport away from private car travel waswidely reported. 
Housing market
Housebuilders and estate agents reported tentative signs of agradual increase in housing market activity, with somecontacts seeing an increase in buyer interest and intransactions.  That was said partly to have reflected falls inmortgage rates and an improvement in mortgage availability,albeit one that was patchier at higher loan to value ratios.There were also signs of a strengthening in new privatehousebuilding from a low base, concentrated in London andthe South East, though that was partly offset by the continuedweakness of social housing starts.  Some contacts reported
that the FLS had engendered increased optimism that housingsales would pick up during 2013. 
Business investment
Investment intentions for the coming twelve monthscontinued to edge higher for the manufacturing and servicesectors.  Investment plans were largely reported to be aimed atincreasing efficiency or addressing regulatory issues, thoughone notable exception remained the energy sector, whereNorth Sea investment was said to have been stimulated by arange of tax allowances as well as sustained high oil prices.  Inthe manufacturing sector, plans to increase capacity weregenerally confined to exporters or to companies looking tointroduce new product lines.  In the services sector, investmentplans were reported to be subdued, though IT investment wasseen as an area of strength, as financial services companiesresponded to regulatory requirements, and as retailers aimedto expand and develop their online presence.  Investment incommercial property remained weak, though a gentle increasein store and hotel refurbishment was reported.  
Exports
Manufacturing exports were reported to be growing, butslowly.  Weak demand in the euro area was being offset bystrengthening demand elsewhere, including from emergingeconomies.  Exports related to foreign oil and gas productionwere reported to be a source of strength, as were exports ofluxury cars and aerospace products.  More generally, exportdemand for niche ‘high-tech’ products remained stronger thanfor lower value-added outputs.  
A sluggish rebalancing towards exports was attributed by
some contacts to the length of time it took to build thenecessary networks;  for some there were signs that thoseefforts were starting to be repaid.  Contacts in certain sectors— such as professional services — noted a tendency to serviceglobal demand through setting up local offices rather thanfrom the UK office, dampening the effect on measuredexports.  However, there continued to be reports in the other direction of the re-sourcing of production to theUnited Kingdom following sterling’s earlier depreciation,coming through with long lags.  More immediately, somecontacts reported greater import competition recently fromeuro-area companies due to overcapacity in their domesticmarkets.  And poor UK harvests were expected to lead to anincrease in food imports.
Output
Business services
Output was reported to be growing very modestly ( Chart 2 ),

their own margins.  Engineering and energy consultancy
reported steady if slow growth as clients sought to use theirservices in an effort to control costs, and recruitment agencieswere reporting an increase in activity, in line with wideremployment trends.  Output in IT services and parts of thedistribution industry was being buoyed by the growth in e-commerce and some banks reported that the FLS hadimproved the outlook for their output.  There were somereports of a slight increase in mergers and acquisitions activityand also litigation activity.  But corporate use of otherdiscretionary business services — such as conferencing andtraining — remained very subdued.  A box on pages 5–6summarises discussions held with business services firms onthe reasons behind weak productivity in the sector since thefinancial crisis.  
Manufacturing
Manufacturing output for the domestic market was reportedto be broadly flat on a year earlier ( Chart 2 ), reflecting
subdued domestic demand.  Some sectors were seeing growthwhere their product was directly for export or part of exportsupply chains.  Growth was reported to be concentrated withinaerospace, niche ‘high-tech’ manufacturing and the supplychain for luxury cars.  Production related to the energy supplychain was also reported to remain resilient, but the output ofconstruction-related sectors remained weak.
Construction
Output remained lower than a year earlier ( Chart 2 ), though
the outlook was reported to be less negative than during 2012.There were some tentative signs reported that private housingconstruction was starting to increase, as the effect of incentiveschemes fed through.  That was partly offset by continuedweakness in social housing construction, which contactsattributed to uncertain financial support for the sector.Development of new commercial property was reported to bevery subdued outside of London, and some major constructioncompanies were said to be choosing to focus activities awayfrom the United Kingdom, and towards higher-growthmarkets.  Contacts noted that while there were signs that
some infrastructure projects were taking shape, the effects ofthose would largely be felt in years to come rather than thenear term. 
Credit conditions
Banking and many non-financial contacts reported that thecost of bank lending had fallen in recent months, which waspartly attributed to the FLS.  A slight easing in creditavailability was reported, particularly for the largest firms, butconditions were little changed for firms seen as riskierpropositions such as small companies.  Little sign of anincrease in bank borrowing was reported, which was largelyattributed to weak demand for credit.  For some businessesthat was reported to reflect a lack of trust in bankingrelationships.  There were tentative signs that banks’ appetitefor forbearance on loans was starting to wane, with somecontacts in the commercial property sector reporting atougher stance being taken by lenders on covenant breachesand sales of assets by property owners whose lenders hadsignalled a lack of appetite to refinance debt.      
Employment 
Employment intentions in business services continued to riseslightly ( Chart 3 ).  That was said partly to reflect firms
competing for market share, the hoarding of skills to meetfuture needs and in some cases a shift towards the use of morejunior staff for routine work.  In consumer services,employment intentions were slightly negative, in partreflecting a number of recent high street failures.Manufacturing employment prospects were flat.  Recruitmentdifficulties continued to be limited, though some signs of skillsshortages were reported in IT and engineering, consistent withthe relative strength of demand in those sectors.

Capacity utilisation remained a little below normal ( Chart 4 ).
In manufacturing, some firms reported increasing slack asprevious investments in capacity had come on line and asexport demand from the euro area had weakened.  Withinservices, there were some reports of gradual consolidationwithin the professional services sector reducing spare capacityover time.  Unused capacity was reported to be highest in theretail sector, partly reflecting a move to online models whichwere reported to be reducing labour intensity and to haveincreased spare physical capacity (such as retail property).More generally, there remained significant unoccupiedsecondary commercial property, though the use of primeproperty was said to be intensifying.  
Costs and prices
Labour costs
The rate of growth in labour costs per employee had edgedhigher.  Pay growth was expected to be little changed in 2013,with settlements said to be centred on the 2%–3% range, asfor the previous year.  Economic uncertainty and continuedslack in the labour market were said to be restraining wagedemands, though slightly fewer pay freezes and someincreased pressure on pay was reported in some areas, such asthe energy sector and IT.  Auto-enrolment was expected bylarger firms to add to labour costs in the coming year, thoughthere was uncertainty about the size of the effect which wouldbe dependent on the eventual opt-out rate.  A box on page 7summarises the results of the Agents’ annual survey on pay
and labour costs.
Non-labour costs
Materials costs and the prices of imported finished goodscontinued to drift up on a year earlier.  Increases in agriculturalprices as a result of poor harvests were reported, though theeffect on consumer food price inflation had been diluted bythe relative stability of some other non-ingredient costs.Increasing sea freight costs — reflecting restricted capacity —were reported to be putting upwards pressure on import pricesgenerally, though prices of some imports from the euro areawere said to be falling in part due to weaker domestic demandon the continent.  Upward pressures from Chinese wage costswere reported to be contained by re-sourcing towards lower-cost production.   
Output prices and margins
Output price inflation remained subdued, with companiesoften unable to pass fully through increases in input costs.  Asqueeze in margins was reported by food producers inparticular, as supermarkets resisted the pass-through of higheringredient prices.  
Retail margins were reported to have been supported by
improved stock management over the Christmas period, whichhad reduced the need to discount goods to clear stock relativeto a year earlier, though many firms reported a generaliseddownward pressure on margins from the rise in e-commerce.In business services, output prices were reported to be littlechanged, with professional services margins said to be underpressure from excess capacity and tight procurement.
Consumer prices
The annual rate of increase of consumer prices was reported tobe stable.  Higher energy and fresh food prices were pushingup consumer prices, though the latter were said to be partlyoffset by promotional activity in supermarkets andcompetition between retailers.  New car prices were generallyreported to be flat after promotional activity, but somecontacts indicated that used car prices were increasing a littledue to low stocks.  Consumer services prices were rising morequickly than goods prices, reflecting increases in administeredprices such as tuition fees, domestic energy prices andtransport costs.   4

productivity
A key feature of the UK economy in recent years has been the
weakness of productivity growth relative to its pre-crisis trend.One area where that weakness has been particularly marked isin business services.  In an effort to understand better thedrivers of weak productivity in this sector, the Agentsundertook over 100 bilateral discussions with professionalservices contacts during November and December 2012.  Thisbox summarises the finding of those discussions.
Contacts confirmed that productivity growth — as measured
by real output per hour worked — had been weak relative topre-crisis trends.  Over the period since 2010 in particular,subdued output had been accompanied by a gentle rise inemployment in the sector, rather than a decline.  Mostcontacts were aware of some spare capacity in their firms andsubsectors, and expected consolidation over time.  However,the prevalence of partnership and owner-managed structureshad allowed many contacts to take a longer-term view, forexample through reductions in partner drawings, and in somecases this approach had been supported by creditorforbearance.
Contacts laid most emphasis on current and future expected
demand conditions as the key drivers of upward employmentdrift and thus weak productivity growth.  The actions taken bycontacts to help them to survive in the weaker demandenvironment, and the need to be prepared for the eventualupturn, were reported to have reduced their productivity, atleast in the short term. 
In particular, weak demand growth had made winning and
delivering work harder, requiring more staff input.  Firms hadsought to expand their geographical and sectoral reach, athome and abroad, potentially depressing productivity due tothe associated set-up costs and overheads.  Up-front businessdevelopment and marketing, together with increasedfrequency and complexity of bidding and tendering forbusiness, were reported to have accounted for increasedemployee time, without always leading to higher output.  Andsome contacts reported ‘overservicing’ clients to retain andwin work, providing more reassurance and added extras.  
Persistent expectations of a return to trend demand growth
were also said to have supported employment.  Contacts hadbeen repeatedly surprised by the weakness of the recovery andthe consequent, persistent lack of staff churn, but enduringoptimism had led them to continue to retain and recruit stafffor the upturn.  In particular, the vast majority of contacts hadresolved not to stop graduate recruitment, having sufferedfrom a severe skills gap in the late 1990s following weak
graduate hiring during the preceding recession.  Moregenerally, many cited maintaining longstanding personalrelationships with clients as a key driver of retention.  In somecases firms were hiring experienced teams and individuals togain market share.
Less emphasis was laid by contacts on more structural drivers
of weak productivity, though some were identified.  AlthoughIT investment had generated some productivity gains early inthe downturn, often replacing administrative staff, furthergains were felt to be harder to achieve given the differentiatedservices being delivered, especially in customer-facing roles.Meeting compliance requirements was reported by mostsurveyed companies (which excluded financial services firms)to have led to a continued small increase in non-chargeablehours worked, rather than any material increased hiring.Credit conditions were rarely mentioned in the context ofproductivity, although tighter debt availability had placedsome constraint on consolidation among small and medium-sized enterprises, partly reflecting that many firms’main source of collateral — their property — had fallen invalue.  Property leases were also said to be deterringconsolidation as it would take time to realise the potentialsynergies from a merger.  And working capital constraints werementioned as a factor by some contacts, partly reflectingincreasing client demand for fee arrangements where paymentis conditional on delivering a final desired outcome.  That hadthe effect of increasing work in progress, tying up cash whichmight otherwise have been put to more productive use, andmeant that some hours worked did not result in ‘paid’ outputs.
Looking forward, contacts expected some gradual recovery of
productivity growth over time, even if demand growthremained subdued.  Contacts expected new markets tobecome more productive and fixed overheads to reduce overtime.  Expected growth rates had gradually been downgradedand there were signs that this was reducing labour hoardingand hiring, especially where companies’ reserves had beeneroded.  But contacts did not on average expect significant joblosses in their own businesses in 2013 and they expectedconsolidation to proceed only gradually, reflecting the natureof management structures in the sector and creditorforbearance.  
Most contacts expected that productivity growth would
increase should domestic demand return to trend rates ofgrowth.  Organic growth in demand from existing clientswould be expected to drive productivity growth, with less timedevoted to new business development.  Contacts also sawpotential for the recent commoditisation of business services— such as web-based recruitment — to generate moreproductivity growth.  Many legal and accountancy firms
Agents’ summary of business conditions February 2013 5reported spare capacity that could be utilised if corporate
finance and commercial property transactions picked upalongside a wider recovery in domestic demand, boostingproductivity.
Contacts did not expect, however, that all of the productivity
shortfall would be recouped.  Some firms had responded toweak conditions by shifting their recruitment mix towardsmore junior staff (paralegals not solicitors; graduates not mid-career hires), whose productivity might be less than 
that of more experienced staff.  Bidding and tendering costswere expected to remain high and time consuming, withclients having got used to choosing between competingbusiness services providers.  And in some cases clients’expectations of higher service levels would also be difficult toerode.  These factors were expected to affect the level ofproductivity in the business services sector over the longerterm.6
Agents’ summary of business conditions February 2013Agents’ survey on pay and labour costs
The Agents have conducted an annual pay survey since 1998,
asking contacts in the private sector about their expected paysettlements for the year ahead, and the key drivers of anychanges to growth in total labour costs per employee.  Thisyear 391 firms responded with a combined UK employment of890,000. 
The average pay settlement for 2012 reported in this year’s
survey was 2.2% (the green diamond in Chart A ).  That was
close to the expectation for 2012 in the previous year’s survey(the blue diamond for 2012).  Looking forward, the averageexpected pay settlement for 2013 from this year’s survey was2.3% (the red diamond).  That remains well below pre-crisisgrowth rates and suggests that pay growth is unlikely to pickup significantly this year.
Responses to the survey suggested that average settlements
were expected to be slightly weaker for small firms (employingfewer than 50 staff) and medium-sized firms (employing 50 to249 staff) than for larger ones ( Chart B ).  Most large firms
expected to make a pay award of between 2% and 3% thisyear.  Expected pay settlements for small and medium-sizedfirms included a higher proportion between 1% and 2% thanfor large firms.  A significant minority of small and medium-sized firms expected to freeze pay during the comingyear, though that share was smaller than in the previous year’ssurvey.
A modest net balance of respondents expected total labour
costs per employee to increase more rapidly in 2013 than in2012.  A significant proportion of the sample expected changesin employer pension contributions to exert upward pressure ontotal labour cost growth ( Chart C ), in part reflecting the
impact of auto-enrolment requirements on the largest firms inthe sample.  More modest upward effects were expected fromchanges in productivity and recruitment or retention of staff.As in last year’s survey, inflation was not expected to putsignificant upward pressure on total labour cost growth.  
Turning to the downward influences, as in the previous survey,
both changes in average hours worked and an inability to passon cost increases into prices were cited as reducing growth intotal labour costs per employee compared with 2012.  Incontrast to last year, when company performance andprofitability was expected to have a negative impact on labourcosts, in this year’s survey no significant effect on labour costswas expected from this source.
