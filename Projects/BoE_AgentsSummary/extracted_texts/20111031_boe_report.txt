Annual growth in nominal spending on consumer goods and services had slowed to a very gradual pace.  
Subdued activity in the housing market reflected continued difficulties of first-time buyers to secure a
mortgage and households’ rising concerns about incomes.
 Investment intentions had softened in recent months.  Some capital spending that had been resumed
after the recession had now been completed, and some plans had been put on hold because of increaseduncertainty about the outlook.
Manufacturing exports continued to grow steadily, although the Agents’ score had fallen back from
recent highs, due to less-favourable base effects and a slowing in orders.
 Manufacturing output for the domestic market continued to grow, although the rate of expansion had
declined in recent months.
 Business services turnover growth remained modest, with some niche service providers raising fees, and
firms in the transport sector passing on higher fuel prices.
 Construction output was broadly flat compared to a year earlier, and slowing public sector orders and
early indicators of private sector demand pointed to a contraction in activity over the coming year.
 Employment intentions in the private sector pointed to further growth in employment over the coming
year.  But the pace of recruitment was expected to slow somewhat, reflecting both past hiring, anddownward revisions to the outlook for demand.
 Capacity utilisation remained a little above normal in manufacturing and somewhat below normal in
services.
There was reported to be little upward pressure on private sector total labour costs , in part because of
employees’ rising fears about job security. 
The annual rate of increase in raw materials costs continued to flatten off, but higher energy prices were
still feeding through as fixed-term contracts expired.
Increased materials costs combined with higher labour costs in some emerging market countries
continued to push up on the price of imports of finished goods. 
The pace of inflation in manufacturing output prices had slowed a little in recent months, while fees for
services gradually edged upward. 
Annual inflation in the price of consumer goods and services remained elevated.

October 2011Demand
Consumption
The annual growth rate of nominal demand remained sluggish,
and the Agents’ score for retail sales values had fallen furtheron the month ( Chart 1 ).  Households remained focused on
value for money, with discount and online retailers, and valueproducts performing relatively well.  Spending on foodremained the strongest component of demand, but even herepromotional activity was essential to drive sales.  Consumerswere increasingly conscious of avoiding waste, and somecontacts thought that promotions involving bundles ofproducts had become less effective.  In non-food, spending ondurables was particularly weak.
The growth rate of spending on services was also fairly slow
(Chart 1 ).  Nominal demand growth for essential services, such
as housing, transport and motor insurance, had remainedrelatively strong, reflecting higher prices.  But that hadsqueezed the amount of income left for more discretionaryservices, causing a decline in spending on a range of leisureactivities.  And there had been shifts in the mix of servicesused, as households tried to maintain broad patterns ofconsumption.  For instance, summer holidays had becomeshorter, and were spent closer to home, and free visitorattractions had risen in popularity, while paid-for ones hadseen footfall weaken.  Services related to the housing market,such as conveyance and removals, reported difficult tradingconditions, while countercyclical legal services, such asemployment litigation, were seeing some growth.
Housing market
The level of activity in the housing market remaineddepressed, due to concerns about job security, as well as acontinued lack of mortgage availability, particularly forfirst-time buyers.  There had been some increase in thenumber of high loan to value products being offered bylenders, but take-up had been low.  Demand for newly builtproperties had begun to rise, thanks largely to shared equityschemes and the Government’s FirstBuy initiative.  And buy-to-let investment had also been picking up, encouraged
by strong rental demand.  Nonetheless, some contactsexpressed a concern that if the low overall level of transactions persisted for much longer, there would be anincrease in closures of estate agents and solicitors reliant onthe market.
Business investment
Contacts planned to increase investment over the coming year,but the pace of growth was expected to slow.  A number offirms had now completed investment that had been restartedafter the recession, and intended to meet further increases indemand with existing labour and capital, rather than byincreasing capacity.  In manufacturing, some contacts reportedhaving scaled back investment plans due to heighteneduncertainty about the prospects for demand.  And persistentslack in the business services sector was beginning to depressinvestment, with some firms using cash reserves to buycompetitors, rather than go for organic growth.  Across sectorsthe replacement of old equipment continued to supportinvestment, along with spending on labour-saving IT and plansto cut energy use.  Product development and innovation wasalso seen by many as essential to remain competitive.
Exports and imports
Exports of goods continued to grow at a fairly rapid pace,although the Agents’ score had fallen back from recent highs(Chart 2 ).  That was in part due to less-favourable base effects
in the annual comparison of the level of exports.  It alsoreflected slowing in demand in the United States and parts ofEurope, and a small impact from civil unrest in the Middle East.But exports to Germany and various emerging economiesremained robust, helped by both the level of sterling andproduct innovation.  Firms were increasingly seeking to offsetweak domestic demand by shifting attention towards exports,and continued to report success in entering new growthmarkets.  Some contacts had also won market share as firmsaround the world diversified supply following the earthquakeand tsunami in Japan.  Despite increased uncertainty about theoutlook for world demand, many contacts expected exports to2

Output
Business services
Turnover continued to grow at a modest pace in the servicesector, with slowing public sector work offset by a gradual rise in private sector activity, although the picture was verymixed across subsectors.  For instance, contacts in IT,telecommunications and energy-related businesses reported asteady improvement in conditions, in part due to the mix ofinvestment in the wider economy.  In contrast, in haulage,contacts were seeing some deterioration in conditions,reflecting softening in the manufacturing sector.  There was a growing sense in some sectors, particularly standardisedlegal and accountancy services, that despite remaining some way below pre-recession levels, demand was likely toremain subdued for some time.  That had encouraged a furtherround of cost cutting, as well as defensive mergers andacquisitions.
Manufacturing
Manufacturing output growth continued at a restrained pace,but had slowed in recent months ( Chart 2 ).  Sources of growth
reflected the broad pattern of spending in the economy as awhole.  Producers of capital goods were still benefiting frominvestment by domestic firms.  And suppliers of intermediategoods ultimately bound for export were growing steadily.  Butoutput of consumer goods, especially durables, had beendeclining.  And some contacts reported that de-stocking bycustomers had weighed on output, or led to a rise in inventory.Food production had also slowed a little, which some contactsthought reflected households’ efforts to economise and cutwaste.  Output of goods for the public sector had beenweakening, particularly in defence, although long-termcontracts meant that work had held up for some.
Construction
The Agents’ score suggested that construction output wasbroadly unchanged compared to a year earlier and remained at a low level.  Activity continued to be supported by projectsrelated to energy, utilities and transport infrastructure, and the expansion of some national retailers.  In London, therewere some large commercial developments under way, along with work on the Olympics, although that was nowdeclining.  Looking ahead, large-scale government schemeswere often nearing completion, with relatively little in thepipeline to replace them.  And indicators of future privatesector work, such as architects’ orders and council planningapplications, had also begun to point to a possible decline inactivity.Credit conditions
Large and medium-sized firms with strong balance sheetstypically reported that they had access to credit if required.But fear of repricing or withdrawal of existing facilitiescontinued to discourage many small businesses fromapproaching lenders altogether.  So far there were only veryscattered reports of a tightening in conditions as a result ofrecent financial market turbulence, although a few contactshad postponed some investment, in case a furtherdeterioration in the economic outlook led an offer of bankfinance to be withdrawn at a later stage.  And lendersthemselves reported an increase in the number of borrowersdelaying decisions on, or declining, offers in principle.  Whilebad debts remained under control, corporate liquidity wasunder pressure, as suppliers tightened up payment terms andcustomers pushed for extensions.  Some firms also reportedthat cash flow had been affected by a stricter approach by HM Revenue and Customs.  And there were concerns thatincreased use of asset-based forms of finance, such as invoicediscounting, instead of overdrafts, could lead to fundingconstraints should there be a sharp decline in orders.
Employment
Private sector employment intentions remained positive, butcontinued to edge down ( Chart 3 ).  Hiring plans were
strongest in manufacturing, particularly in the export sector,but increased uncertainty about the economic outlook had ledto greater caution about future recruitment, and increases inheadcount were typically achieved through greater use oftemporary contracts.  Intentions had also been softeningbecause for some firms, headcount had caught up withdemand, and further increases in output were expected to beachieved through higher labour productivity.  Use ofapprenticeships was increasingly widespread, to avoid futureskills shortages.

–Over the next yearChart 3 Employment intentionsEmployment intentions in the services sector also pointed to
continued modest recruitment.  Some of the biggeraccountancy firms were reinstating graduate recruitmentprogrammes, to maintain key skills for when activity began togrow more robustly.  And employment intentions alsoremained strong in growth areas such as IT.  But some largefinancials and marketing companies planned to reduce staffnumbers.  And some smaller firms in accountancy and lawwere contemplating redundancies, as demand remained weak,or in anticipation of regional consolidation.  There waswidespread concern among contacts about the burden offorthcoming employment legislation.
Capacity utilisation
Capacity utilisation was slightly above normal in themanufacturing sector, with some firms now reporting that pastinvestment and recruitment was beginning to deliver someadditional slack.  And there were signs that some temporarysupply constraints had eased off, as supply chains ofengineered products had now caught up with demand, andtraining of past recruits was delivering productive new staff.But some firms reported that concerns about the sustainabilityof growth had made them less inclined to bring mothballedcapacity back on stream than they were a few months ago.
Service sector firms tended to have somewhat more spare
capacity than in manufacturing.  Many firms reported beingbusy, as there had been a shift in staff resource away from thedelivery of services, towards business development.  And theywere often competing across a greater range of services, orover a wider geographical area than usual.  But persistent lowlabour productivity, and now a recent further softening indemand conditions, were leading some companies toreappraise employment levels, and oversupply had promptedconsolidation in certain sectors.  In growth areas, such as IT,and some niche professional services, there was relatively littleslack, however.  
Costs and prices
Labour costs
Contacts continued to report that labour costs were growingat a moderate pace.  There was relatively little upwardpressure on settlements, and pay increases were often skewedtowards younger, lower-paid staff.  Awards in manufacturingtended to be higher than in services.  There continued to begreater use of performance-related pay and bonuses, ratherthan across-the-board increases, with high bonuses this yearusually reflecting better-than-anticipated profitability in 2010.Across sectors contacts reported a pickup in the incidence ofpay freezes.  And few were now expressing nervousness aboutthe coming pay round, as renewed uncertainty had led job
security to again take primacy over pay for most workers.
Non-labour costs
Contacts reported that the pace of inflation in materials pricescontinued to fall from recent peaks, as a range of commoditiesand processed input prices began to level off.  But higherenergy costs continued to be felt as fixed-term contractsexpired, and some firms were attempting to offset that byreducing their energy usage.  Some contacts reported that ithad become more difficult to enter into fixed-term contractsfor some inputs, and volatility in spot prices had made it moredifficult to price outputs.  The price of imports of finishedgoods continued to rise, due to past increases in raw materialscosts and an increase in production costs in China, inparticular, although some firms were offsetting this by re-sourcing production to other, lower cost, emerging marketproducers.
Output prices
Manufacturing output prices continued to rise at a steadypace, although there had been a fall in the Agents’ scores forannual output price inflation in recent months.  Some contactshad managed to increase prices to offset rising input costs,although the degree of pass-through was typically partial.Contacts’ difficulties in passing on higher costs had causedthem to increasingly focus on efficiency of production andimproved purchasing.  Among business services, output priceswere rising gradually, although there was considerablevariation between sectors.  Reflecting the highly competitiveenvironment in many professional and financial services,corporate hospitality, and property-related businesses, feeswere often still under significant downward pressure.  Butthere had been some increase in the prices of travel, transportand haulage, reflecting higher fuel costs, and in fees for certainessential services.
Consumer prices
High annual inflation in consumer goods prices reflected risesin energy prices, the increase in VAT at the start of the year,and inflation in the price of food and imports of finished goods.Promotional activity had been widespread, however, offsettingsome of the hit to household spending power.  Some retailerssuggested that multi-buy promotions were becoming lesseffective — perhaps because consumers had become morefocused on containing spending, or reducing waste — and wereincreasingly using straight discounting instead.  Inflation in theprice of consumer services was also elevated, largely reflectingincreases in the prices of non-discretionary services, such asrent and transportation.  But a squeeze on spending power hadled to downward pressure on the prices of non-essentials, suchas hotel stays and meals out.4
Agents’ summary of business conditions October 2011Agents’ survey on exports
To try to gauge the degree to which export growth was
expected to support the recovery over the coming year, theAgents conducted a survey on the outlook for foreign trade.Contacts were asked about export growth over the pasttwelve months, their expectations for export growth overthe next twelve months, and the drivers of those changes.257 firms responded, with a combined turnover of £40 billion.
Weighting the data by export shares, a large positive net
balance of the sample reported that export volumes hadcontinued to grow over the past year, in many cases quitestrongly ( Chart A ).  Looking ahead, an even larger net
balance of contacts anticipated strong growth over thenext twelve months.  This was somewhat surprising, givenrising concern about the outlook for world growth.
According to respondents, exports of goods had performed
better than services over the past twelve months ( Chart B ).
But both manufacturers and services sector firms expectedexports to pick up over the next twelve months.  And thereappeared to have been a particularly marked improvement inexpectations among services firms.
Part of that might have been due to a skew towards
high-growth markets among the sample of services exporters.In contrast, goods exports tended to be towards more maturemarkets.  A number of service sector contacts reported thatthey had only quite recently shifted their focus towardexternal markets, in light of persistent weakness of domesticdemand.  And they often focused on meeting rising demandfor legal, accounting and engineering expertise in emergingeconomies in Asia and the Middle East in particular.
Across sectors, contacts often attributed growth over the past
twelve months to product innovation, the supply of nicheproducts, and previous efforts at building distribution
channels, all of which had helped to open up altogether newmarkets.  And a simple unweighted net balance showed thatmoving into new markets was the most commonly cited driverof expected export growth over the next twelve months(Chart C ).
On the demand side, contacts were most optimistic about the
prospects for emerging markets in Asia and the Middle Eastover the coming year ( Chart C ).  And the outlook for demand
from the United States was thought to have improved.Euro-area demand was expected to provide less support togrowth over the next twelve months than the past twelve, butthe net balance remained positive.  Price competitivenessappeared to have done relatively little to support exportgrowth over the past twelve months, although the level ofexports may already have benefited from the earlierdepreciation of sterling.
