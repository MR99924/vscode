March 2011Demand
Consumption
Retail sales turnover continued to rise at a modest pace in
February ( Chart 1 ).  But the rise in turnover was in large part
due to relatively rapid increases in prices.  The annual growthrate of volumes of sales was thought to have slowed.  In lightof increasing concerns about inflation, and its impact on realincome, consumers were thought to have redoubled theirefforts to obtain value for money.  There was less scope forshoppers to make price comparisons with new or improvedproducts, however, which afforded firms some opportunity torebuild their margins.  And some contacts had begun to focuson delivering product innovations, rather than discounts, tostimulate demand.
The annual rate of growth in turnover in consumer services
had been fairly sluggish, and the Agents’ score had fallenfurther ( Chart 1 ).  Taken together with a rise in inflation, that
signalled a fairly marked slowing in volumes growth.  Therehad been a fall in demand for short breaks and secondholidays.  Hoteliers were struggling to maintain occupancylevels.  And spending on leisure activities had weakened.  Butthere had been a small boost to spending in restaurants andpubs, due to Christmas-related spending that had beenpostponed as a result of the wintry weather during December.
Housing market
Activity in the housing market had been quite volatile duringrecent months.  Lately, some contacts had reported thatactivity in the housing market had picked up somewhat.  Therehad been a small rise in visitor numbers to newly builtproperty, which was thought to have been helped by theincreasing availability of financing products offered by homebuilders themselves.  And enquiries and viewings had increasedin the secondary market.  But first-time buyers continued to behampered by a lack of mortgages at high loan to values.  Andthere had been a rise in cancelled transactions, due toconcerns among buyers about further falls in prices, anddisappointment with surveyors’ valuations.  The rental market
remained buoyant.
Business investment
Investment intentions in the manufacturing sector pointed tosolid growth in capital spending over the next twelve months.New investment was being driven primarily by expectations offurther increases in demand, particularly among exporters,with reports of investment in additional capacity becomingmore widespread.  Efficiency and the resumption ofreplacement cycles continued to account for a large part ofplanned investment.  But some contacts noted that theimminent completion of investment projects that had been onhold during the recession would tend to weigh on investmentgrowth going forward.  For them, the peak rate of growth ininvestment may now have passed.
Investment intentions in the service sector pointed to a more
restrained pace of growth than in manufacturing.  Investmentwas still motivated in large part by the need to replace existingcapital, or achieve efficiency gains.  The pace of expansion ofseveral large retailers had started to slow and that was nowdetracting from the rate of aggregate investment growth.Moreover, those plans might be scaled back if the outlook forconsumer spending became more uncertain.  But certainsectors were likely to benefit, as consumers increasinglyfocused on value for money.  Some leisure attractions plannedto invest in facilities in anticipation of another year of supportto demand from UK residents holidaying at home.  And budgethotel and restaurant chains were expanding capacity.
Exports
The Agents’ score pointed to rapid growth in the value ofgoods exports, and rose further on the month, thanks to risingdemand from emerging markets and a strengthening ofdemand in some European countries, especially Germany.Exports to the United States were also thought to have beengrowing at a gentle pace.  And a few more contacts reportedhaving successfully accessed new markets.  Demand hadcontinued to rise for components related to the aerospace andautomotive sectors.  Reflecting the rapid growth inmanufacturing and rising investment in rapidly growingeconomies, there had also been a rise in demand for capitalgoods.  And higher energy prices had supported growth indemand for equipment used in the sector.
Output
Business services
Contacts in professional and financial services continued to seefairly restrained growth in turnover ( Chart 2 ).  And there had
been a growing drag on underlying activity from decliningpublic sector work.  But the private sector was providing asource of some growth.  An increase in corporate financingbusiness had helped to support legal and accountancy2

practices.  Solicitors had been undertaking a little more work
on joint ventures and product licensing, which was perhaps areflection of a gradual shift in the focus of clients towardsforeign markets.  And there had been a slight rise in propertyleasing, as firms sought to make the most of low rents, or tookplans for office moves off hold.
The pace of growth in turnover in other business services also
pointed to a relatively gradual recovery in the sector ( Chart 2 ).
The experience of hoteliers and conferencing facilitiesproviders was fairly typical, with rising corporate sectorspending being offset to a significant degree by a fall inrevenues from work for the public sector.  But there had been arise in shipping and haulage volumes, reflecting the strength ofmanufacturing output, as well as a rise in imports of capitalgoods, consistent with the pickup in firms’ investment plans.  
Manufacturing
Manufacturing output continued to grow steadily.  Producersof capital goods reported that they had seen a rise in activity,reflecting investment intentions both abroad and at home.  Bycontrast, output of consumption goods had weakened, asoverhangs of stocks and uncertainty about the outlook forhousehold spending had induced retailers to reduce orderlevels.  And there was reported to have been a fall in publicsector orders of consumable goods.  
Construction
Having been depressed by the extreme weather in December,activity in the construction sector had picked up.  And some ofthe time on site that had been lost before Christmas had nowbeen recovered.  The Agents’ score suggested that the level ofconstruction output during the past three months was broadlyunchanged compared to the same period a year earlier.  Butthere were concerns about the outlook, and there had been amarked increase in the intensity of competition, placingfurther downward pressure on already slender margins.  Therehad been an increase in enquiries from manufacturersregarding new sites for production and distribution facilities.But falling public sector work was expected to begin to weigh
heavily on growth from next year as outstanding projectsreached completion.  As a result, many contacts expected arise in the number of insolvencies in the sector going forward.
Credit conditions  
Large firms reported that credit was readily available.  The rateof interest on loans had declined a little more, due to increasedcompetition among lenders and the improving health of thecorporate sector, although fees remained fairly high.  Firmswith significant holdings of fixed assets tended to be offeredthe most favourable terms.  That was true also for a smallminority of small and medium-sized companies.  But,generally, smaller firms did not report much, if any,improvement in credit conditions.  And rather than providepersonal guarantees, which was increasingly a requirement,some contacts had opted instead to rely on their own financesrather than use bank credit facilities.
Employment
Contacts in the private sector thought that employmentwould continue to grow at a modest pace over the next sixmonths.  Unsurprisingly, recruitment plans were strongestamong exporters, although there were reports of a change inthe mix of new staff, with increased hiring of sales people, totry to make more of rapidly growing markets.  Firms continuedto make use of temporary contracts, given uncertainty aboutfuture demand.
Contacts in professional and financial services reported that
there were plans for a small amount of recruitment over thenext six months.  There was also expected to be further hiringin the IT sector and shipping.  But employment intentionsamong consumer-facing firms were weakening.  And as thepace of expansion of some of the larger retailers slowed, thatwould tend to lower the growth rate of employment.
Capacity utilisation
According to contacts, capacity utilisation was around normalin manufacturing, particularly among exporters, and that hadprompted some to invest in capacity.  However, there werealso several reports this month from firms that consideredthemselves to be operating at full capacity, but which couldraise supply quite readily by bringing on additional shifts.Those firms remained reluctant to raise their capacity,however.  That was partly because it would increase costs, butalso because of uncertainty about the prospects for demand.Contacts in the service sector tended to report that they hadsignificant scope to increase supply.  This reflected a surplus ofboth labour and physical assets, such as office space,warehouses and hotel rooms.  4321012345

Labour costs
In manufacturing, total labour cost growth had risen to around
its historical average rate, often reflecting improvedprofitability, or recognition of staff loyalty following severalyears of wage freezes or muted pay growth.  And there hadbeen some partial compensation for elevated inflation,especially among some of the more heavily unionisedworkforces.  In services, where profitability had yet to recoveras much, there had been less of an increase in the growth rateof total labour costs.  And, generally, contacts reported thattheir employees’ expectations for pay increases in 2011 wereonly a little higher than a year earlier.  Labour cost growth wasreported to have been particularly weak among firms withsignificant exposures to construction and the public sector. 
Non-labour costs
Materials costs continued to rise quickly, and there had been afurther increase in the Agents’ score for annual inflation (Chart 3 ).  Inflation in materials was being driven by higher
prices of agricultural commodities, fabrics, and fuel.  The use ofhedging and annual contracts was expected to mitigate theimpact on firms in the near term.  The pace of inflation in theprice of imports of finished goods was also elevated ( Chart 4 ).
Imported finished goods prices had been pushed up by thehigher cost of materials and transportation, as well as anincrease in wage pressures in Asia.
Output prices
The Agents’ score indicated that manufacturing output priceinflation had edged upward on the month ( Chart 3 ).  Some
firms reported that they had managed to pass on part of therise in materials costs, and a few were beginning to rebuildmargins.  Retailers were only very gradually allowing the rise inthe cost of agricultural commodities to be passed on by foodsuppliers, however.  Manufacturing firms that had been unableto pass on much of the rise in the cost of inputs had tried to
preserve their margins by reducing other costs.
There had been significant downward pressure on fees paid 
to suppliers of business services.  But the Agents’ score fortotal business services prices indicated that they had nowstabilised, with the level of fees at around the same level as ayear earlier.  Nevertheless, firms exposed to the public sectorcontinued to face a particularly challenging pricingenvironment.  There were signs of renewed falls in the feescharged by professional and financial services.  And thesuppliers of services related to the construction sectorcontinued to report falling prices.  By contrast, charges fortransportation, logistics, haulage and distribution had all risendue to higher fuel costs.
Consumer prices
Consumer goods price inflation had risen further ( Chart 4 ),
driven in large part by the recent increase in VAT, as well ashigher import prices and transportation costs.  But, while listprices were rising, some of that was reported to have beenoffset by further discounting.  For clothing and footwear,further increases in prices were expected as spring andsummer lines arrived, since these would reflect recent rises inthe cost of fabrics more fully than had winter fashions.
The annual rate of inflation in consumer services prices was
also somewhat higher than its historical average.  That was inlarge part due to the recent increase in VAT.  Insurancepremiums for motor and buildings cover were also risingquickly due to increases in the value of claims, and insurersrebuilding their reserves, which had been eroded.  Hotelierswere discounting room prices in order to maintain occupancylevels, however.  And holiday operators were lowering prices inresponse to disappointing bookings of winter and summerholidays.4
