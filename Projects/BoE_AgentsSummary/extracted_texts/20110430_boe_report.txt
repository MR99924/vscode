April 2011Demand
Consumption
The Agents’ score for nominal spending on retail goods fell in
March ( Chart 1 ).  Against a backdrop of rising inflation, that
suggested slowing growth, or even declines, in volumescompared to a year earlier.  Within that, there had been a fallin the growth rate of spending on durables and the shifttowards consumption of lower-quality products hadcontinued.  Contacts attributed these trends to fallingconfidence among households, and the effect of high inflationon real spending power.  And the outlook for consumption wasthought to have weakened.  There were, however, somereports of rising spending on premium brands of food, retailgoods and cars.  
As with consumer goods, there had been an ongoing trend
towards spending on cheaper consumer services.  Dining out inrestaurants had declined but demand for fast food continuedto strengthen.  And there was some evidence of a switch awayfrom the use of private cars toward public transport.  Moregenerally, spending on non-essential services was thought tohave fallen.  For instance, hotel bookings were down comparedto last year, and were being made much later.  But, as withgoods, there were some signs that spending on services at theexpensive end of the spectrum had strengthened.
Housing market
Having received mixed signals about the strength of activityaround the beginning of the year, contacts now reported thatthere had been a softening in the housing market.  Concernsabout future incomes and the prospects for house prices wereweighing on demand, while first-time buyers remainedconstrained by a lack of credit.  The re-emergence ofbuy-to-let investment was helping to support demand,however.  There were signs of a fall in supply of existing homesonto the market, as vendors had become more cautious.  Inthe market for newly built homes, there was reported to havebeen a slight improvement in activity, with enquiries and saleshaving picked up a little.  That was thought to reflect a change
in the mix of the supply of properties toward the type of largerhomes sought by households with access to finance.
Business investment
In the service sector, contacts expected investment tocontinue to grow at a moderate pace ( Chart 2 ).  That was in
large part due to spending on IT to reduce costs, or improveon-line presence.  In the financial sector, firms were alsoinvesting to meet coming changes to regulatory requirements.There had been a slight slowing in the pace of expansion ofsome of the large retailers and budget hotel chains.  Butretailers were investing more in warehousing and distributionfacilities.
In the manufacturing sector, intentions suggested that growth
in investment would be a little more robust than in services.That was particularly true of the export sector, where therewere further reports from firms that planned to expandcapacity to meet rising foreign demand.  There were alsocontinued reports of new product development to target rapidgrowth markets.  Investment among firms facing the domesticmarket was more likely to be motivated by efforts to findefficiencies, perhaps by reducing energy costs, or resumingroutine replacement and maintenance projects that had beenon hold.
Exports
Exports of goods continued to grow quickly, with the Agents’score rising further on the month.  This was driven by rapidgrowth of demand in emerging markets, along withstrengthening activity in parts of Europe and in theUnited States.  Exports of capital goods had been growingparticularly strongly reflecting the mix of world activity, withthe aerospace, automotive, energy and construction sectorsproviding much of the impetus.  Some contacts among smallerfirms reported that they were unable to target growthmarkets, however, because of the high initial cost of entry, andsignificant attendant risks.  Civil unrest in the Middle East andNorth Africa had, in some instances, led to a hiatus on2

spending for certain professional services.  But for most
exporters, it remained too early to say with confidencewhat the overall impact on demand would be.  See the box onpage 5 for the findings of a survey by the Agents on imports.
Output
Business services
There had been a gradual improvement in the growth rateof turnover in professional and financial services.  Reports ofa modest rise in accountancy and legal work reflected, inpart, an increase in mergers and acquisitions activity.  Propertyleasing had picked up a little, as firms felt better placed tomake longer-term decisions on office space.  And the ITsector continued to benefit from the efforts of firms in thewider economy to achieve efficiencies.  But a fall in publicsector work had offset much of the improvement from theprivate sector.
Similarly, in other business services there had been some
improvement in activity in corporate travel and amonghoteliers and providers of corporate conferencing facilities.But there were widespread reports of a fall in supply to thepublic sector.  Contacts at ports reported a rise in shipments ofgoods, which might have been a function of the strength of theexport sector.  And hauliers continued to benefit from thegrowth in manufacturing output.
Manufacturing
Foreign demand was helping to support domestic suppliers ofintermediate and capital goods to the export sector,particularly in the aerospace and automotive industries.Businesses that ultimately served the domestic market weregrowing at a more modest pace.  And there were some reportsfrom suppliers of consumer goods of a slowing in the rate ofgrowth of output, with some unplanned build up of stocks as aresult.  Across the manufacturing sector, despite rising outputand fairly strong order books, contacts remained uncertainabout the outlook for growth.  Some considered their ownpositive experience unrepresentative, or were downbeatbecause of the pressure on household spending power.
Manufacturing output was expected to exhibit a little more
volatility than usual over the coming months.  Following theJapanese earthquake, some manufacturers that dependedheavily on components from Japan had slowed production toconserve inventories.  The full effect on output would likelytake some time to be felt, as it worked its way through thesupply chain.  But, so far, the impact on output for mostcontacts had not been significant.  The royal wedding in Aprilwas also expected to generate some unevenness in monthlygrowth rates, as firms rescheduled production to make up forlower output during the week of the event.  The impact onoutput over the second quarter as a whole was expected tobe limited.Construction
The level of construction activity remained relatively subdued.There had been a small increase in commercial projects in thecapital, but outside of London there was little speculativecommercial development underway.  There had been someincrease in activity from exporters seeking to refurbishpremises, or move into larger ones, as well as some projectsrelated to renewable energy and infrastructure.  And there hadbeen a small rise in house building, albeit from a very low level.A slowing in the pace of expansion of retailers was expected toexert a drag on the rate of growth in construction, but therewas increased work on warehousing and distribution facilities.The very negative outlook for public sector work continued toweigh heavily on sentiment in the industry.
Credit conditions
Large firms continued to report that they had access to creditif required.  And competition had lowered the cost ofborrowing further, although credit spreads were still highcompared to prior to the recession.  Contacts among somesmall and medium-sized companies with significant holdingsof assets and strong cash flow had also seen an improvementin credit conditions.  But many small and medium-sized firmsremained frustrated with their current banking relationships,and some were planning under the assumption that theywould not make use of bank finance in the medium term.
Employment
According to contacts in business services, hiring was expectedto continue, albeit at a rather slower pace than prior to therecession.  Firms in the IT and engineering advisory sectorsplanned to raise headcount further.  And accountancy andlegal firms intended to take on more graduates over thecoming year.  Services firms related to the construction sectorwere more pessimistic about employment, however.  Amongconsumer-facing firms, there was expected to be only a smallincrease in jobs over the next twelve months, despite thecontinued expansion of some of the larger retailers, and theAgents’ score had edged down further.
Contacts in the manufacturing sector also expected to
continue to recruit more staff over the next six months.  Muchof that would be under temporary contracts in the firstinstance.  But there were a number of reports of existingtemporary and part-time staff having been converted topermanent and full-time contracts, as firms had become moreconfident in their own prospects.  Concerns about skillsshortages in the sector had re-emerged, and the pace ofexpansion was such that there was thought to be a greater riskthan usual that this constraint would become binding.  As aresult, a number of firms had started to make more use ofapprenticeship schemes.Capacity utilisation
For most manufacturers, the level of capacity utilisation was
thought to be broadly normal ( Chart 3 ).  But there were
further reports from exporters who were now approachinguncomfortable levels of capacity utilisation, and wereinvesting in additional capacity in response.  There were alsoreports of shortages of raw materials and components in somesectors, due to global supply problems.  It remained unclear towhat extent the earthquake in Japan might add to these.  Therecontinued to be a substantial amount of slack in services,leading to strong competition in some sectors.
Costs and prices
Labour costs
Labour costs in the manufacturing sector had picked up a little,to around the pre-recession growth rate.  Average settlementshad risen due to improved profitability, and recognition of pastwage restraint.  There had been fewer instances of pay freezes,and more reports of above-average settlements among someof the more rapidly growing exporters.  Overtime and bonuseshad also risen compared to last year.  The rate of growth oftotal labour costs in services remained rather slower than inmanufacturing.  Contacts attributed that to the still-significantamount of slack in the sector, as well as continued jobinsecurity.  Across manufacturing and services there had beena degree of compensation for increases in the cost of living.
Non-labour costs
Contacts reported that inflation in the cost of raw materialshad edged higher ( Chart 4 ).  Suppliers of a range of materials
were now only offering indicative prices for forward delivery, orwere only entering into very short-term contracts.  And civilunrest in the Middle East and North Africa had pushed up thecost of oil.  There were few reports of additional pressures onprices arising directly from the Japanese earthquake, thoughthe full implications of the disaster remained unclear.  Inflation
in the cost of materials and transportation, and higher wagecosts for suppliers in some emerging markets had added to thecost of imports of finished goods.
Output prices
Contacts reported that manufacturing output prices wererising at a moderate pace ( Chart 4 ).  Manufacturers had
managed to pass on some of the increase in the cost of inputs,and had begun to reprice outputs more frequently to reflectchanges in costs.  But food manufacturers continued to find itdifficult to negotiate price increases with supermarkets.  Thecompetitive environment in professional and business servicescontinued to exert downward pressure on fees, especially forstandardised legal and accountancy work, and for firms relatedto the construction sector.  Some specialist professionalservices had managed to raise their prices, however.  And firmsin haulage, distribution and transportation had also had somesuccess in passing on the higher cost of fuel, often throughautomatic surcharges.
Consumer prices
Contacts reported that consumer goods price inflationremained elevated, and had risen slightly on the month.  TheAgents’ score for the past three months compared to the sameperiod a year earlier had been pushed up by the recent increasein VAT, as well as the higher cost of materials, importedfinished goods and fuel.
In consumer services, the rate of inflation remained around its
historical average.  Higher fuel costs had pushed up privateand public transport costs.  And the price of car insurance hadalso risen very sharply compared with a year earlier.  Butcharges for non-essential services had been rising less quickly.There had been considerable discounting in the leisure sectorand for hotel rooms, to try to boost demand.  And somerestaurateurs reported that there was little scope left to adjustmenus to avoid passing on cost increases.4

The value of sterling declined significantly from around the
middle of 2007, raising the price of foreign goods and servicescompared with domestically produced ones.  An importantinfluence on the strength of the recovery has been the extentto which the lower level of the exchange rate has led toswitching of expenditure away from relatively more expensiveimports, toward domestic alternatives.
To investigate the factors influencing imports, the Agents
asked contacts about changes in the share of imported inputsover the past three years, and the drivers of those changes.The Agents also asked about expected changes over the nextthree years.  The results of the survey are weighted by turnoverand import intensity of production.
Imports of intermediate goods and services, which firms use in
the production process, or to support operational activities,comprise around 60% of imports.  A substantial majority offirms reported that since the depreciation, the share ofimported intermediates in total non-labour inputs hadremained broadly the same, or increased slightly ( Chart A ).
In many cases domestic substitutes were still considered
uncompetitive ( Chart B ).  Or there simply were no domestic
substitutes to switch to.  Among the other factors affectingimport intensity of production were the use of globalprocurement practices by international firms, and the cost ofswitching towards domestic producers.
The net balance of firms expecting the input share of imports
to rise over the next three years remained positive, althoughthere was a slight shift in the distribution of responses towardfirms that expected it to fall.Turning to finished goods and services, which account for
around 30% of imports, a majority of respondents reportedthat there had been no change in import penetration over thepast three years ( Chart C ).  The relative cost of domestic
alternatives and outright lack of supply were the dominantdrivers.
Imports of finished goods were expected to become less
competitively priced over the next three years, due to risinglabour costs in some emerging economies, and highertransport costs.  Nevertheless, over that time horizon, therewas a small rise in the net balance of firms expecting anincrease in the intensity of use of imported finished goods, asfirms planned to re-source inputs from other low-cost overseasproducers, instead of repatriating production.
Basic materials, which include energy, make up the remainder
of imports.  Import intensity had risen since the depreciation,but there was only a small positive net balance expectingfurther increases going forward.  Lack of availability ofdomestic substitutes was the overriding influence.Agents’ summary of business conditions April 2011 5
