more adversely affected than retail sales .
In the housing market , concerns about future income growth and the path of house prices were reported
to be weighing on demand.

January 2011Demand
Consumption
The value of retail sales continued to grow at a moderate pace
(Chart 1 ).  But spending over the festive period had fallen short
of expectations overall.  There had been little sign of thehoped-for rise in spending ahead of the VAT increase.  And theparticularly severe weather in December was thought to havereduced the value of sales somewhat.  There were likely tohave been fewer impulse purchases due to lower footfall.  Andthere were some concerns that distribution problems mayhave prevented timely restocking, perhaps resulting in somelost expenditure.  There had been some offset to lower sales inshops from higher on-line custom, while local retailers werethought to have benefited from disruptions to shoppers’ travelplans.  
There had been a slightly sharper fall in the Agents’ score for
consumer services than for goods.  Consumer services werelikely to have been hit rather harder than retail goods by thecold weather, as householders were thought to be uninclinedto make up for missed spending opportunities on things likemeals out.  Leisure and tourism had been affected the most,with many contacts reporting a significant decline in sales.Spending on services related to the housing market was alsothought to have weakened somewhat, though that may havebeen due to factors particular to that market, rather than thewintry conditions.  
Housing market
Contacts in the housing market reported that the number oftransactions continued to fall, beyond what might have beenexpected on the basis of typical seasonal patterns.  Underlyingthat decline were rising concerns about the outlook forincomes.  And there was also thought to be increasedcautiousness due to fears about further falls in prices, withsome vendors now waiting until their own property had soldbefore buying another.  Access to credit, particularly for first-time buyers, continued to weigh on demand.  On thesupply side, despite the low level of new housebuilding, andsome vendors’ decisions to remove properties from the
secondary market, stock to sales ratios were rising.  Houseprices were falling as a result, and were expected to fall further. 
Business investment
The Agents’ score for investment intentions in themanufacturing sector had reached a level that pointed toannual growth rates broadly in line with those seenimmediately prior to the recession ( Chart 2 ).  Firms facing the
domestic market were motivated primarily by the desire tomake efficiency gains or to replace existing capital.  Amongexporters, there were more reports of the development of newproducts to diversify into growth markets.  And there wereplans to raise capacity to meet still rapid demand growthabroad, though much of this investment would be done nearerto export markets, to reduce both production and transportcosts.
Investment intentions in the service sector were also rising,
but remained below pre-recession levels.  Investment planswere still driven largely by efficiency and replacement motives.But, in financial services, some contacts were investing in newIT to help them meet coming changes in regulatoryrequirements.  Contacts in ports and shipping planned toincrease physical capacity.  And there were reports ofcontinued investment in new premises by some large retailers,although the pace of expansion was slowing. 
Exports
The Agents’ score for manufacturing export growth reached itshighest since the start of the series in July 1997.  Foreigndemand was strongest in emerging markets.  Firms inengineering and energy-related sectors had seen particularlyrobust growth.  Contacts reported some success in penetratingnew markets and raising shares in existing ones.  That wasthought to reflect in part the resource spent developingtrading relationships around the start of the recession, whichwas now beginning to yield results.  Conditions in maturemarkets, including the United States and Europe, were stillimproving only gradually.  And there were clear signs of2

weakness in some of those countries that had been affected
most by recent disturbances in sovereign debt markets.
Imports continued to grow quickly.  But there continued to be
concerns about uncertainties surrounding delivery times,transport costs, and quality.  And while many contacts thoughtthat there was little scope to source inputs of materials orcomponents domestically, a few had managed to do so.  Andthere were reports of plans to bring the production of someinputs in-house.  That would tend to lower the import intensityof production in the future.  
Output
Business services
The Agents’ score suggested that the growth rate of turnoverin professional and business services remained below average.But financial advisory work had picked up a little compared tolast year.  And contacts in the IT sector continued to benefitfrom the current mix of firms’ investment projects.Recruitment and advertising were being supported by risingactivity in the private sector, but that was dampened by adecline in public sector work. 
Corporate travel and distribution services were growing at a
modest pace, perhaps thanks in part to the strength of trade.But both had been adversely affected by the bad weather.Contacts in shipping had seen an improvement in activity.  Andprivate sector business was supporting hoteliers and providersof commercial premises.  But corporate hospitality — whichtended to represent discretionary spending — remainedsluggish, and had felt the impact of snowy conditions keenly.  
Manufacturing
Robust overseas trade continued to support manufacturingoutput.  Contacts all along the automotive supply chain werebenefiting from foreign demand.  There was strong growth inthe aerospace sector.  And producers of investment goodsreported that their output was growing quickly, withinfrastructure, energy and mining sectors all particular sourcesof growth.  Contacts in food production and packaging hadalso seen a rise in activity. 
Construction
The Agents’ score for construction had fallen slightly on themonth.  The extreme weather had weighed on activity in thesector significantly, even though some of the worst conditionshad occurred during the pre-Christmas shutdown period.  Theunderlying level of activity was thought to be broadlyunchanged compared to last year.  Some larger companiescontinued to benefit from projects in London related to theOlympics and commercial real estate.  There were alsowidespread reports of work on utilities and transportinfrastructure, and there continued to be some support fromthe efforts of certain large retailers to expand their nationalfootprints.  But these were not expected to provide a source ofmuch growth in the near term, and there would be a drag from
lower public sector work.  In the near term, however, therewould be some boost to growth as improvements in theweather allowed work to be resumed.  And there was expectedto be an additional fillip to activity from more repair andmaintenance work than usual.
According to contacts in the construction sector, some large
customers had been consolidating business with individualcontractors, to reduce costs and minimise risk.  At the sametime, large contractors were more likely than smaller ones tohave the financial strength needed to be able to fund projectsjointly with developers.  That gave them an additionaladvantage in securing work.  And they had been taking on jobsthat would previously have been left to smaller firms.  Thesefactors were thought to be causing industrial concentration torise in the sector.
Credit conditions  
The Agents continued to hear that credit conditions wereimproving for large firms.  Many such contacts reported thatthe availability of credit was more or less back to normal.  Butthe cost of finance compared to Bank Rate remainedsignificantly higher than its pre-crisis level, and it was stilldifficult to secure long-term loans.  Small firms reported thatcredit conditions remained tight.  There were a few reports ofan improvement in access to bank finance, although theongoing shift towards lower risk and more costly forms oflending was thought to have continued.  Many small firmswere focused on paying back past borrowing to regain controlover their financial arrangements.  At the sectoral level,contacts in manufacturing reported that trade credit wasbecoming more readily available, perhaps reflecting growingconfidence among lenders in the recovery in trade.  
Employment
Employment intentions in both manufacturing and servicespointed to a modest pace of job creation by the private sectorover the next six months ( Chart 3 ).  The Agents’ score for

–Over the next six monthsChart 3 Employment intentionsmanufacturing was now well above pre-recession levels, with
employment intentions particularly strong among exporters.Employment intentions in business services were ratherweaker than prior to the recession but pointed to some growthnonetheless.  Intentions were particularly high in the IT sector.Contacts in consumer services also expected to recruit overthe next six months, due in part to the need to staff newlyopened stores.  
Capacity utilisation
Rising demand for manufactured goods had pushed capacityutilisation in the sector to around normal levels, especiallyamong exporters.  Most contacts felt able to meet expectedincreases in demand over the next six months.  But a few wereat full capacity, and planned to invest in capital to be capableof meeting additional demand.  And there were further reportsof shortages of some inputs.  Capacity utilisation in theservices sector was still somewhat below normal.  Andcontacts could meet a significant pickup in demand withexisting labour and capital.
Costs and prices
Labour costs
In manufacturing, labour costs were rising at around the pre-recession average rate.  Part of that was due to an increasein hours worked by staff.  And there had been a pickup insettlements, in part due to the rise in productivity in thesector.  In the service sector, there was rather less upwardpressure on labour costs than in manufacturing.  Moregenerally, there were further instances of an increase in the useof discretionary awards based on performance.  But someemployers had also raised pay to reward staff loyalty,particularly if there had been several years of pay freezes.  Andthere were more reports of a degree of compensation forelevated inflation.
Non-labour costs
According to contacts, there had been a further increase in thecost of agricultural commodities due to a combination ofhigher world demand and supply disruptions, and metals priceshad also risen more quickly.  The cost of energy had gone up,and higher oil prices were feeding through to plastics and otheroil-based products.  There were also increases in the cost ofpaper and packaging.  The higher cost of materials had begunto feed through to the price of imports of finished goods.  Thecost of clothing, for instance, was rising due to higher cottonprices.  And higher wages in China were also contributing toinflationary pressures.
Output prices
Rising costs had squeezed manufacturers’ margins.  Manycontacts, particularly those that were higher up the supplychain, reported that they now had to pass higher costs on.Cost pass-through had only been partial so far, but the
intention was to pass through more of the past increases goingforward.  
Business services prices continued to fall compared to a year
earlier, particularly for services of a standardised nature, and inthe corporate hospitality and construction sectors.  A fewcontacts in professional services thought that the downwardadjustment represented a normalisation to some extent,profits having been abnormally high prior to the recession.  Insome growth sectors, like IT, and in certain niche services,firms had been able to raise fees.
Consumer prices
The Agents’ score suggested that the annual rate of inflation inconsumer goods remained slightly above average, and hadrisen a little further this month.  In particular, higheragricultural commodities prices were feeding through to theprices of bread and meat products.  Consumer servicesinflation was thought to be broadly in line with the historicalaverage.  Underlying that, there had been upward pressurefrom essentials like energy, and motor and buildings insurance.But there had been downward pressure from non-essentials,like meals out and hotel stays, perhaps in response toconsumers’ efforts to keep tight control of discretionaryspending.  
According to a survey of retail contacts carried out during
December, 84% of respondents intended to pass on the rise inVAT in full, and 11% planned to pass on at least half of it(Chart 4 ).  Taken together, that suggested overall pass-through
of at least 90%, which is rather higher than suggested by anequivalent survey for the previous VAT increase.  Most of thatwould come through within the first few weeks of the year,although some firms had raised prices already.  A number ofcontacts would take a little longer, however, either to see whatcompetitors did, or until standard repricing periods, like Easter.4

productivity
According to official data, employment fell by rather less
during the recession than GDP.  As a result, there was a fall inoutput per worker relative to its pre-recession level.  Some ofthat decline in labour productivity has since been reversed, asGDP has grown more rapidly than employment during therecovery.  But there may still be scope to raise output throughfurther productivity gains.  
To investigate the outlook for productivity, the Agents asked
contacts about expectations for activity and headcount overthe next twelve months, the extent to which additionaldemand could be met with existing staff, and the factorsinfluencing expected changes in employment.  370 firmsresponded to the survey.  All of the figures shown are weightedby headcount.
Over the next twelve months, more firms expected their own
level of activity to increase than decrease ( Chart A ).  The
expectations for headcount over the same period were a littlemore balanced.  That suggests that output growth couldcontinue to be more rapid than employment growth, and thatthere might be some scope for a further rise in labourproductivity.
Indeed, the vast majority of those surveyed judged that they
would be able to meet at least some additional demand usingexisting labour.  A little over half of the sample reported thatthey could raise output by up to 5% using existing staff (Chart B ).  Less than one tenth of those surveyed had no spare
capacity at all by this measure.  Smaller firms, employing fewerthan 250 people, tended to report that they had more sparecapacity to meet additional demand than the sample as awhole.Expected demand was reported to be supportive of
employment over the next twelve months ( Chart C ).  But, not
surprisingly, the scope for firms to raise output throughproductivity improvements tended to weigh on theirrecruitment intentions.  Nearly half of firms reported thatincreases in output per worker were a factor serving to reduceexpected employment growth over the next twelve months.  And a number of contacts reported that uncertainty about thestrength of the recovery would hold back employment growth.
