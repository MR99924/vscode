June 2014Demand
Consumption
Annual retail sales values growth had picked up sharply,
following a recent weakening — a pattern that reflected thelater timing of Easter than last year ( Chart 1 ).  Sales had been
particularly strong at both the value and premium ends of theretail spectrum.  Demand for home-related durable goods suchas fitted kitchens, bathrooms, furniture and flooring hadcontinued to strengthen.  And better weather than a year agohad boosted the annual growth rate of demand for seasonalclothing and footwear, DIY goods and garden furniture andequipment.  Demand for new cars had remained elevated dueto competitive pricing and the ready availability of affordableleasing finance.  Growth in demand for consumer services hadbeen broadly stable, and remained slightly stronger than forretail sales.  Consumers were increasingly willing to spend onleisure activities, such as pubs, restaurants and hotels.  Thetravel industry had reported a robust start to the season forboth domestic and foreign travel.  Signs of growing householdconfidence were also evident in stronger demand for financialadvice and private medical insurance.
Housing market
Activity in the housing market had eased, with a number ofreports of lower levels of mortgage completions and approvalsthan last month.  This was thought to be due to a continuedshortage of properties for sale and the implementation of theMortgage Market Review (MMR), which had slowed theprocessing of mortgage applications.  It was unclear to whatextent the MMR would have a longer lasting or structuralimpact on the mortgage market.  The softening in activity hadbeen most pronounced in parts of London, where pastincreases in stamp duty and concerns about prospectiveincreases in housing taxes had also reduced demand for housespriced over £2 million, including from foreign buyers.  In therest of the United Kingdom, there had been sustained demandgrowth for new houses, especially from first-time buyers usingthe Help to Buy equity loan scheme.  House price inflation had
remained modest outside the South East.
Business investment
Investment intentions of manufacturers and service sectorfirms had moderated slightly, having increased throughoutmost of the previous twelve months.  In some cases this wasbecause businesses had already invested heavily in recentyears and were now scaling back capital expenditure to morenormal levels.  Meanwhile, investment in some of the mostcapital-intensive manufacturing sectors was still being heldback by expectations of poor profitability.  There wereincreasing numbers of reports of consumer-facing businesseswishing to invest in new capacity, reflecting a recovery indemand and profitability.  Commercial property developmenthad also picked up a little, as available supply of prime space inindustrial and office markets had become increasingly tight.Some firms, however, preferred acquisition to capitalinvestment as a means of expansion, perceiving the associatedrisks to be lower.
Exports
Annual growth in manufacturing export values had continued,albeit at a slightly slower rate.  That had partly reflected thenegative effect of the recent appreciation of sterling on exportmargins, though volumes were reported to have been littleaffected as exporters had tended to hold their foreign currencyprices constant.  Demand had improved modestly in theeuro area — although some of the pickup had been inintermediate goods, such as those into the automotive sector,ultimately exported elsewhere.  Sales had continued to risesteadily to the United States across a wide range of sectors.But a slowdown in construction activity in emergingeconomies had lowered demand for capital goods, whiledefence spending in the euro area had continued to decline.The crisis in Ukraine had so far had little impact on goodsexports.  Services exports growth had remained stable.  Inwardtourism, both business and leisure, had strengthened, notablyfrom the United States.  Foreign investment in UK propertyhad continued to increase, boosting demand for relatedprofessional and financial services.
Output
Business services
Business services turnover had continued to grow, but at amarginally slower rate than in recent months ( Chart 2 ).
Demand for professional and financial services was beingsupported by improving economic prospects and a slowlyrecovering commercial real estate market, with rising occupierdemand.  However, some contacts reported that the recentboost to corporate deals from a release of pent-up merger andacquisition activity might start to wane in the coming quarters.Output growth of investment banking services had declined,reflecting ongoing structural changes in the industry that had2

reduced capacity, coupled with easing demand.  The number of
corporate and personal insolvencies had also continued to fall,reducing demand for business turnaround and restructuringactivities.  In contrast, consultancy, marketing and recruitmentfirms reported stronger growth.  And contacts in theconstruction supply chain, such as architects, surveyors andreal estate advisors, had seen a steady increase in activity.Logistics and IT companies reported accelerating demand, butcorporate spending on travel, conferencing and car hireremained subdued, reflecting a keen focus on cost control.
Manufacturing
Manufacturing output for the domestic market had continuedto strengthen.  Output of construction-related products hadaccelerated on the back of growth in house building and animproving pipeline of civil engineering work.  Consumer-facingmanufacturers had benefited from a pickup in volumes,notably for big-ticket consumer durables such as cars, floorcoverings and furniture.  Automotive, civil aerospace andenergy supply chains reported elevated, if steady, growth.Food processors reported weaker growth, however, partlyassociated with fewer ‘multi-buy’ promotions by retailers thathad reduced sales volumes.  The weakest growth had beenseen among manufacturers of defence equipment, the heavyvehicles supply chain (due to the impact of new emissionsregulations), and the paper and printing industries, as mediaactivity continued to move online.
Construction
Growth of construction output was steady and above itslong-term average rate, with reports of stronger activitystarting to spread beyond house building.  Infrastructureinvestment was increasing, particularly on railways and atports, and there was more optimism surrounding the prospectsfor construction projects in the energy sector.  Development ofnew industrial property outside London was increasing, albeitfrom a low base, and a few speculative office projects hadcommenced.  Housing starts had continued to increasestrongly, but shortages of materials and skilled labour werecausing some delays, and housing completions, though
significantly up year on year, had remained well belowlonger-term averages.
Credit conditions
Credit availability had improved further, aided by increasedcompetition between lenders.  Credit conditions had improvedfor firms of most sizes, though conditions remained tight forthe smallest businesses.  Although demand for credit had risen,many firms had continued to seek to reduce their debt levelsand preferred to fund expenditure out of retained cash, despitea fall in the cost of bank finance.  Lending by challenger banksand crowd funders had continued to grow.  The availability offinance for real estate projects other than speculativedevelopment had widened with finance from specialist fundsor insurance companies available where traditional lenders hadstepped back.  The availability of funds for corporate dealssuch as mergers and acquisitions had increased.  Althoughthere had been isolated examples of working capitaltightening, insolvencies had remained at low levels.
Employment
Employment intentions had been little changed and stillpointed to modest growth in staff numbers over the nextsix months.  Contacts expected to grow headcount in order toraise output, alongside anticipated productivity improvements.For some manufacturers, further automation and greater useof temporary workers was expected to be sufficient to meetnear-term rises in demand.  Employment prospects in businessservices had remained relatively firm, despite announcementsby some investment banks suggesting significant job losses inthat sector.  Recent job creation had been strongest in IT, realestate and construction-related services, but had now startedto broaden out to other professional services where increasedworkloads were stretching capacity.  Employment intentions inconsumer services had edged up further, driven primarily bythe need to staff additional retail capacity and to support thedevelopment of online platforms.  Recruitment difficulties hadremained a little above normal, due mainly to shortages in IT,engineering, and construction/property and related services.However, unskilled and semi-skilled labour had remainedreadily available.  Professional services firms reported a dearthof experienced staff in the labour market, due to low levels ofhiring in recent years.  More generally, some firms wererecruiting apprentices/trainees in anticipation of future skillsshortages.  Low barriers to entry in some services, such asbusiness consultancies and estate agencies, were reported tohave facilitated increased self-employment in these areas.
Capacity utilisation
Capacity utilisation had continued to edge higher and was nowmarginally above normal ( Chart 3 ).  However, there hadThree months on the same period a year earlier

remained a significant amount of under-utilised capital in
some firms — especially in retailing.  In manufacturing, capitalinvestment had often created additional capacity over the pastyear and there was the potential for some businesses to addfurther labour shifts to better utilise existing plant.  Somecontacts noted there remained scope to increase productivityby reallocating staff to more productive work from back officeor business development roles now that demand wasincreasing robustly.  Capacity constraints were most notable inthe construction sector and its supply chain.  House buildersreported falling behind build programmes due to a lack ofskilled labour and, to a lesser extent, delays in the delivery ofbricks and blocks.  Service sector capacity utilisation hadcontinued to edge higher, reflecting increased labourutilisation.  Capital asset utilisation in the service sector hadalso increased, with, for example, growing demand for officespace and higher hotel occupancy rates.
Costs and prices
Labour costs
Growth in labour costs per employee had edged up slightly,remaining moderate ( Chart 4 ).  Reports of pay freezes had
fallen, and there were some cases of significant increases inawards, but the majority of settlements had remained withinthe 2%–3% range.  There was evidence of firms responding toconcerns about losing staff as levels of labour churn increased,with some introducing more targeted pay awards for keyperformers.  And skill shortages were putting upward pressureon pay growth in sectors such as construction, engineering andsome professional services.  More generally, pay was also beingboosted by performance-related awards, usually linked toprofits and sales.  Auto-enrolment in workplace pensionschemes had provided a modest stimulus to the growth oflabour costs per employee.  The increase in the NationalMinimum Wage due in October was likely to lead to somefurther compression of differentials at the lower end of payscales, and some contacts expected it to reduce the rewardsthey could afford to give to higher-paid staff.Non-labour costs
Materials costs had declined slightly compared with a yearago.  The main exception remained construction materials,where price inflation had remained elevated due to supplyshortages.  The appreciation of sterling over the past year hadincreasingly become reflected in lower sterling prices paid formany imported materials.  But for a minority of materials,foreign suppliers had looked to restore margins by raisingprices set in foreign currency, leaving sterling prices littlechanged.  The costs of imported finished goods were stable.Prices had not fallen in line with sterling’s appreciation, mainlydue to firms’ hedging strategies and rising labour costs ofoverseas producers.  And some contacts were still locked intofixed-price contracts based on the exchange rate a year ormore ago.
Output prices and margins
Manufacturing output price inflation had increased modestly,with more firms able to pass on limited price increases asdemand recovered.  For most, significant rises were onlypossible when new lines were introduced, or for niche productsin short supply.  Some food manufacturers had seensupermarkets reduce their prices as a result of greatercompetition in the sector, with further price cuts expected inthe future.  Following recent large price increases, inflationrates for building materials had eased a little, perhapsreflecting previously mothballed capacity coming back intoproduction.  Business services price inflation had remainedmodest, and pricing was still under downward pressure forcommoditised services.  But there was greater scope to raiseprices in some recovering markets — such as primecommercial property and construction services.  Margins ondomestic sales were reported to be improving slowly, asoutput volumes and productivity grew and input costsdeclined, especially for manufacturers.  For exporters,however, sterling’s appreciation had compressed margins.The results of an Agents’ survey on profit margins are reportedin the box on page 5.Over the coming six months

Agents’ survey on profit margins
To help to assess possible future upwards pressure on inflation
from companies’ efforts to raise profitability, the Agentsconducted a survey to investigate corporate profit margins.The Agents asked how current operating profit margins(defined as operating profit as a proportion of turnover)compared to levels that companies saw as ‘sustainable’ overthe medium term.  Where margins were not at sustainablelevels, respondents were asked how long it would take beforethey returned to being sustainable.  The survey also exploredhow margins had changed over the past year, how they wereexpected to evolve over the next twelve months, the maindrivers for any changes in margins and the motivations behindcompanies’ pricing plans.  A total of 429 companies respondedto the survey, employing over 572,000 people.
Weighting the results by employment, just over half of
respondents described their margins as being aroundsustainable levels ( Chart A ), but a sizable net balance of
companies — approaching a third — reported that theirmargins were below a sustainable level.  Across sectors, onlymanufacturing yielded a positive balance of firms reportingmargins above a sustainable level.
Some 80% of those firms reporting margins as not at
sustainable levels expected that margins would return tosustainability over the next 1–3 years.  Only 4% envisaged thatmargins would return to sustainable levels within the nexttwelve months.
Almost half of all respondents reported a decrease in margins
over the past twelve months, yielding a negative net balanceof nearly 10% ( Chart B ).  The decline in margins was
broadly-based across sectors with only consumer servicesfirms reporting a positive net balance.  Looking over the nexttwelve months, however, some 60% of respondents expectedmargins to increase a little, with a positive net balance ofaround a quarter of firms.  Net balances for expected changes
in margins were positive across all sectors.
Among the drivers of change over the past twelve months,
output/retail prices, volumes and productivity gains inparticular had acted to increase margins, with labour andnon-labour costs providing downward pressure.  Over the nexttwelve months, a greater number of respondents expectedhigher business volumes to affect margins positively than overthe past twelve months, and non-labour costs were expected tohave less of a drag in the next twelve months, perhapsreflecting some pass-through of sterling appreciation ( Chart C ).
In terms of motivations for pricing plans, some nine out of ten
respondents reported that they were not planning to cut pricesto increase market share in the next twelve months.  There wasa more balanced response as to whether companies intendedto increase prices as the economy recovered, with 45%indicating that they would and 47% saying they would not.Some three quarters of respondents reported that they did notexpect margins to increase when interest rates begin to rise.

Consumer price inflation had fallen slightly, driven by services
prices.  Retail goods price inflation was stable.  Nationalsupermarkets had started to lower the prices of essentialitems, in order to improve competitiveness.  There had been afurther move away from ‘multi-buy’ promotions ortime-limited discounts towards outright price reductions.  Cardealers were pursuing market share by offering more attractivedeals.  But in other retail sectors, including durables and
household goods, an uptick in demand had enabled retailers toimplement fewer price discounts and promotions.  Consumerservices price inflation had declined slightly.  Insurancepremiums had softened further and competition for housingstock had continued to exert downward pressure on estateagency fees.  In the leisure sector, improving demand hadresulted in a modest increase in price inflation.6
