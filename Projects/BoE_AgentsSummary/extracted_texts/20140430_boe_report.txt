April 2014Demand
Consumption
Annual growth in the value of retail sales had eased ( Chart 1 )
although contacts had suggested this was likely to betemporary, due to special factors such as Mother’s Day andEaster falling later in 2014 than in 2013.  Food sales values hadslowed, partly reflecting a weakening of prices for some foodsand a shift towards purchasing at discount stores.  By contrast,durable spending had picked up, with contacts reporting anupturn in sales of kitchens, bathrooms, furniture and homeimprovement products.  Sales of new cars had continued togrow strongly, with dealer contacts generally achievingchallenging March targets for new registrations set bymanufacturers.  Growth in consumer services turnover hadbeen more resilient than retail sales.  Consumers had becomeincreasingly willing to spend on leisure activities, eating out,home services via broadband and holidays.  
Housing market
Transaction volumes had continued to rise strongly in thehousing market, with many contacts reporting double-digitpercentage increases on a year ago.  That was leading tocontinuing growth in activity for estate agents, residentialconveyancers and mortgage brokers.  Estate agents reportedthat new instructions were rising, but were lagging the increasein home sales.  Widespread shortages of stocks for sale werereported, with levels significantly below those of a year earlierin many cases.  Reports of double-digit annual rises in houseprices were restricted to London, where overseas investmentremained an important factor driving prices.  Elsewhere, houseprice inflation had remained more modest.  
Business investment
Contacts’ investment intentions had continued to strengthenas confidence increased, though a cautious approach persisted.Many contacts reported increasing spending in non-capitalintensive areas, such as product development, branding,training, and new media.  Manufacturing contacts were
investing for productivity gains, energy efficiency and to someextent to add capacity in growth areas.  In consumer-facingsectors, the focus was principally on refitting and upgradingexisting space to enhance customer experience;  the mainexception was value stores where new-build programmes wereadding to capacity.  More generally, investment in IT hadcontinued to strengthen, driven by the need to open up newdigital customer channels, the pursuit of efficiency and,increasingly, by the integration of merged entities.  However,some multinational enterprises had continued to prioritiseinvestment in faster growing world markets in preference tothe United Kingdom. 
Exports
Growth in manufacturing export volumes had increased,supported by recovering global economic activity.  The effecton volumes of the recent appreciation of sterling had beenlimited to date as exporters had largely held their localcurrency export prices flat.  US demand had grown, as hadexports of niche products to the Middle East, while Europeandemand had steadied.  There were no reports of any majorimpact to date on exports to Russia arising from politicaluncertainties in Ukraine.  Automotive goods had remained asource of export growth.  More generally, export demand forindustrial components had risen, suggesting the worldeconomy was growing more strongly than last year.  Servicesexports growth had continued, in part reflecting efforts by UK companies in recent years to widen their client base tomarkets further afield.  In particular, consultancy related toinfrastructure development in the Middle and Far East hadcontinued to grow.  Increasing inward investment to the United Kingdom from overseas had increased demand forcommercial property-related services.
Output
Business services
Business services turnover growth had increased ( Chart 2 ).
Growth in financial and professional services turnover hadrisen and had broadened to a wider range of subsectors.Commercial real estate investor demand had increased,supporting related services, such as architects, surveyors andconveyancing.  Initial public offering (IPO) and mergers andacquisitions activity had been buoyant, as had consultancywork preparing businesses for sale.  Spending on marketing andpublic relations services had increased as business confidencehad improved, and recruitment agency activity continued tostrengthen.  The rate of growth in other business services hadalso picked up, though activity levels were uneven across subsectors and regions.  IT services had continued to growrobustly, driven by demand for software and system upgrades.The recovery in construction had bolstered workloads forcontacts in a variety of subsectors, including hauliers, builders’2

merchants and plant hire firms.  Corporate travel bookings and
conferencing had remained well below pre-recession levels,but hotels had reported signs of improvement on a year earlieras companies had started to increase discretionary spending.  
Manufacturing
Growth in manufacturing output for the domestic market hadpicked up further ( Chart 2 ).  Among subsectors, output of
construction products had grown particularly strongly.Growth in aerospace and automotive supply chains hadremained robust, driving output growth in a diverse range ofother subsectors.  There had remained a few exceptions to thisstrengthening outlook, however.  In particular, defence outputwas reported to be affected by cuts in military spendinginternationally, and paper and printing output had fallen dueto the ongoing shift towards electronic media.  
Construction
Growth in construction output had remained robust ( Chart 2 ),
led by house building but with a modestly increasingcontribution from commercial development.  Housing startsand completions had risen strongly on a year earlier, thoughsmaller builders had continued to cite concerns about fundingconstraints and difficulties obtaining materials.  Commercialactivity outside London had started to rise, but continued tobe predominantly focused on the industrial and warehousingsectors, alongside the refurbishment of retail premises.  Bycontrast, speculative development of offices had remainedvery rare outside London.  There had been a growing trend forvacant office space to be converted to student and otherresidential use.
Credit conditions
Credit conditions had continued to ease.  Many largercompanies described themselves as well-funded and able toaccess a range of borrowing options.  Bond issuance and IPOshad become increasingly popular sources of financing andchallenger banks had come into the lending market.  In contrast, small firms, particularly those short of
unencumbered assets, had continued to find the availability ofbank lending tight.  However, asset finance was reported tohave become increasingly available across companies.Lenders’ appetite had continued to vary across sectors, withspeculative property development, consumer services andretail sectors seen to be relatively unpopular.  Loan demandhad remained fairly subdued.  Some companies reportedstrategies that avoided a reliance on bank borrowing, even atthe cost of some reduction in their growth.  Property-relateddemand for finance was said to be picking up, often as a resultof businesses seeking to purchase premises.  The results of anAgents’ survey of credit conditions are reported in the box onpages 5–6. 
Employment 
Employment intentions had edged up further outside theconsumer services sector ( Chart 3 ).  Intentions were generally
growing at a lower rate than output, suggesting someexpected improvement in productivity.  Employment growthappeared strongest in IT, professional services, andconstruction and related services, with those increasespartially offset by consolidation in other areas, such asconsumer financial services.  The main driver of recruitmentwas reported to be the improving economic outlook, but somecontacts were expanding apprenticeship and graduateprogrammes in response to anticipated skill shortages, or forsuccession planning.  Recruitment difficulties had remainedmarginally above normal.  Skill shortages were most evidentwithin IT, engineering, haulage and construction, but reports ofa broadening to other areas, largely senior managementpositions, had continued.54321012345

Capacity utilisation
Capacity utilisation was little changed on the month and
remained close to normal.  Constraints had remained mostevident in construction, where shortages of materials and skillshad persisted.  Physical capacity in manufacturing was seen tobe sufficient to allow companies to respond to increaseddemand in the near term through the use of overtime orproductivity improvements.  Capacity utilisation in businessservices had not risen in line with the recent pickup in activitydue to a wave of recruitment in the sector.  Within consumerservices, spare capacity had remained evident in underutilisedstaff and vacant retail premises, though there were signs thatthe occupation of unused retail space had started to rise. 
Costs and prices
Labour costs
Annual growth in labour costs per head had remainedmoderate, though had edged higher in the service sector.  Paysettlements had remained subdued in the vast majority ofcases.  There were continuing reports of companies having topay more than expected to recruit new staff or retain key skills,alongside some modest increase in labour market churn,though that was not as yet spreading into higher pay awardsmore generally.  Some service sector contacts noted that theprospective 3% increase in the national minimum wage inOctober could have a wider effect on wages at the lower endof the pay spectrum.
Non-labour costs
Materials costs inflation had edged lower ( Chart 4 ).  Costs
were broadly unchanged on a year earlier, though within thetotal, fuel and oil-based materials costs had fallen on a yearago while there had been significant inflation in someconstruction materials.  Energy costs were also higher on ayear earlier.  Imported finished goods inflation had continuedto fall and was close to zero.  The appreciation of sterling hadhelped to offset the impact of rising labour costs in the Far East.  Looking forward, contacts were concerned about theimpact on availability and costs of oil, gas and wheat werethere to be an escalation of tensions in Ukraine.
Output prices and margins
Output price inflation had remained modest.  Mostmanufacturing companies had been relatively constrained intheir ability to raise prices as customers were aware that costinflation on domestic and imported materials was weak (Chart 4 ), and for those supplying supermarkets there wasdownward price pressure.  Building materials production had
remained an exception as increased housing activity hadresulted in some substantial year-on-year price increases.  Inprofessional and financial services, fees for commoditisedwork, such as audit, were still under pressure, but as volumeshad started to increase, contacts reported some ability toincrease fees on transactional and other value-added work.Rising starting salaries were reported to be leading to some feeinflation for recruitment companies.  Modest growth incompanies’ profitability had continued, in part reflectingincreased volumes, reductions in some materials costs andefforts to improve efficiency.  
Consumer prices
Retail goods price inflation had remained modest.  Retailcontacts reported being cautious of raising prices given thatconsumers were highly price sensitive and adept at comparingprices on-line.  Downwards pressure on inflation had beenevident in lower petrol and heating oil prices on a year earlier.Food price inflation was expected to fall back further as aresult of announced forthcoming price cuts by majorsupermarkets.  Looking forward, farming contacts did notanticipate any impact on food prices from the exceptionallywet winter weather in the United Kingdom, but noted possibleimpacts on wheat and energy prices if there were anyescalation in the Ukrainian situation.  Retail services priceinflation had remained somewhat stronger than goods priceinflation.  There had been some inflation in prices for visitorattractions and UK holiday accommodation.  Conveyancingfees had also increased modestly in response to higherdemand.  Conversely, though, competition for housinginstructions had led to downward pressure on some estateagents’ fee rates.  321012345

pricesAgents’ survey on credit conditions
The Agents surveyed their contacts during February and March
to test the extent to which non-bank businesses hadexperienced any easing of credit availability over the past year,as well as to assess the impact that this might have had onfirms’ behaviour.  Some 470 firms responded, and results areshown in an unweighted form to highlight any differences inexperience by firm size. 
The survey found that credit availability had increased over the
past year, and by more than in the preceding year ( Chart A ).
Reports of increased availability of credit were common tofirms in all sectors and of all sizes.
(1)In contrast, little change
in the cost of credit was reported in the survey ( Chart B ),
despite frequent reports from a range of contacts over recentmonths of strong competition among banks to lend andincreased switching between lenders.Concerns over credit availability
Respondents to the survey were asked to identify ‘major’ or‘minor’ business concerns from a specified list.  Responsessuggested that access to finance was not currently among themost pressing issues for businesses.  The regulatoryenvironment and ongoing pressure on profit margins wereboth mentioned almost twice as frequently than credit, whilestaffing issues such as retention or recruitment difficulties andthe weakness or uncertainty of demand also featured moreprominently.
Demand for finance
A positive net balance of respondents reported growth indemand for finance over the past year ( Chart C ).  This pattern
was common across sectors and most pronounced amongconstruction contacts.  But the increase was not materiallygreater than in the previous survey, suggesting that demandfor finance had not accelerated recently.Agents’ summary of business conditions April 2014 5

–Chart D Impact of changes to credit conditionsEffect of changes to credit conditions
Firms that had experienced changing credit conditions were
asked if this had caused any changes to their behaviour.  A netbalance of around a third reported increased investment plans(Chart D ), a stronger response than in 2012 and 2013 when
trends in credit availability were considered more mixed.Taken at face value, this could indicate upside news relative tothe picture of modest growth in investment expectationspainted by the Agents’ capital expenditure survey inOctober 2013.  But some caution should be exercised ininterpreting these results.  Respondents may have thoughtabout ‘investment’ in the credit conditions survey in broader
terms than capital expenditure alone, to include, for example,acquisitions activity and investment in training.  In addition,capital spending tends to be dominated by large firms, many ofwhom have not been credit constrained for some time,whereas these survey results focus equally on firms of all sizes.
(1) For purposes of firm-size analytics, firms were split into large (turnover >£50 million),
medium (£10 million–£50 million) and small (<£10 million).6 Agents’ summary of business conditions April 2014
