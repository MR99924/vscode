Annual growth in the value of retail goods and services was reported to have remained modest.  
There had been further signs of an increase in housing market activity , supported by reductions in mortgage
costs.  Some contacts thought that the effects of the Funding for Lending Scheme ( FLS) had become more
evident on the pricing and availability of higher loan to value ratio mortgages.
The cost of credit was reported to be falling for some firms, though not for many smaller companies.
Improvements in credit availability remained mostly confined to larger businesses and credit demand
remained weak.  
 Investment intentions had edged higher, which was said partly to reflect improved confidence amid
diminished uncertainty about the near-term global outlook.
Growth in exports of goods had edged up and perceptions of the outlook for export demand had improved. 
 Manufacturing output for the domestic market remained slightly lower than a year earlier, though 
forward-looking sentiment had improved.
Output of business services had ticked up, with some increase in mergers and acquisitions and financial
market activity.
 Construction output remained subdued, though there were reports of a slight strengthening in private
homebuilding activity by larger firms.
 Employment intentions had edged higher in business services but were broadly flat for manufacturing,
consistent with the pattern of output in those sectors over the past year. 
 Capacity utilisation remained a little below normal.  There were few reports of recruitment difficulties
outside of information technology and engineering. 
The rate of growth in labour costs per employee remained subdued, though some firms reported increasing
pension costs. 
Inflation in material costs and finished import prices was unchanged.  
 Output price inflation remained muted.  
The rate of inflation in retail goods and services prices had edged up.

March 2013Demand
Consumption
Retail sales values were reported to have risen only modestly
in the past three months, relative to a year earlier, with growthoften reported to reflect price increases rather than volumes.Some contacts reported that adverse weather in late Januaryhad a slightly negative impact on sales overall.  More generally,the picture of mid-market retailers being squeezed by discountand higher-end outlets continued, while out-of-town andonline sales were benefiting at the expense of local stores.One area of continued strength had been new car sales,though some contacts noted that some of those gains hadpartly come at the expense of second-hand sales.  Growth inconsumer services demand also remained modest, and hadalso been affected by poor weather, though there werecontinued reports of ‘bigger-ticket’ services — such as foreigntravel — outperforming the wider market.  There were also anumber of reports of some housing market services —including estate agency and mortgage brokerage — starting toexperience a pickup.  
Housing market
There were further reports from housebuilders and estateagents of signs of a gradual increase in housing market activity,both for new home sales and secondary market transactions.That was reported to have reflected falls in mortgage rates andan improvement in mortgage availability, as well the effects ofspecific incentive schemes for home ownership.  The easing incredit conditions was feeding through to higher loan to valuemortgages more widely than before, though conditions forfirst-time buyers remained difficult.  Some contacts saw thatdemand and supply in the housing market had become morebalanced in recent months.  Demand in the private rentalmarket had remained strong.
Business investment
Investment intentions for the coming twelve months hadedged higher for manufacturing and services ( Chart 1 ).  Uncertainty about near-term demand had fallen back as
concerns about the global outlook had lessened, providing amore stable platform for investment.  Nonetheless, concernsabout the wider macroeconomic environment remained highand investment was often ‘incremental’ — seeking to improveefficiency rather than to expand capacity.  Increasinginvestment was often reported in IT, in part to expand anddevelop ‘online’ activities.  Investment had remained relativelystrong in those companies in or closely linked to the energyand utilities sectors, and weak in consumer-facing productsand heavy construction sectors.  
Exports
Manufacturing exports ( Chart 2 ) were reported to have gently
picked up, as a result of gains in market share and somestrengthening in global demand outside of the euro area, andcontacts’ perceptions of the outlook for export demand hadimproved.  Some services exporters had seen a similar patternwith, for example, reports of increased exports in architecturaland engineering consultancy due to growth in the emergingeconomies.  More generally, growth was reported for thosecompanies manufacturing for, or servicing the production of,energy overseas.  As yet, effects from the recent depreciationof sterling were limited to removing concerns that werebeginning to emerge last autumn that some multinationalsmight switch production back to continental Europe.  
On the imports side, increasing Chinese labour costs, higher
freight costs and an appreciation of the renminbi were leadingto a continued shift in sourcing towards other markets, both inAsia and closer to home — including, in some cases, back todomestic markets.  More generally, a slow stream ofproduction switching back to the United Kingdom continuedto be reported following sterling’s 2007/08 depreciation, butagainst the backdrop of an ongoing structural shift of domesticlower-value work to cheaper markets overseas.  There werecontinued reports of greater import competition from euro-area companies due to overcapacity in their domesticmarkets.  Poor UK harvests were said to be leading to anincrease in food imports.  2

Output
Business services
Turnover was reported to have strengthened a little for
professional and financial services ( Chart 3 ), partly related to
an improvement of global sentiment in the absence of adverseshocks.  According to some contacts, a period of stability hadencouraged a slight pickup in corporate mergers andacquisitions activity, raising demand for advisory work forlarger accountancy and legal services firms.  Inflows to assetmanagement had picked up, as had trading activity.Separately, some growth in consultancy work was alsoreported, reflecting companies’ efforts to reposition themselvesstrategically, review product ranges, or cut costs;  ITconsultancy was a particular area of strength as companiesupdated systems, moved online or adopted mobile platforms.Commercial property related work had also picked up, albeit insome cases because tighter regulatory requirements wereleading banks to seek more valuations or reduce forbearance,leading to new transactions.  But many smaller professionalservices firms had not experienced a pickup in activity.  Andother business services turnover was reported to have remainedsubdued, with companies continuing to exert tight control overdiscretionary expenditures such as corporate hospitality,conferences and business travel.
Manufacturing
Manufacturing output for the domestic market was reported tohave remained slightly lower than a year earlier ( Chart 2 ),
though some reduction in global uncertainty had improvedsentiment among companies in export supply chains.  Areas ofgrowth within the sector included those related to utilities andoil and gas production, aerospace, luxury and fuel-efficient carsand high-tech electronics.  But output among manufacturers ofmany consumer goods, heavy construction goods and paperand newsprint was weak.  As yet, little impact was reported onfood production from the horsemeat furore, though it was tooearly for contacts to draw firm conclusions about the longer-term effects.Construction
Output remained lower than a year earlier.  Some largeinfrastructure projects were reported to be providing support tothe sector, notably in the rail and energy sectors, but elsewhereweak publicly funded and private sector commercialconstruction continued to act as a drag on activity.  There werereports of a slight strengthening in private homebuildingactivity by larger firms, though many smaller firms reportedtheir activity remained credit constrained.  Some contacts alsonoted that changes in permitted development rights mightencourage the conversion of commercial space for residentialuse.  Social housing activity was reported to have remainedweak, though some mitigation of funding difficulties for socialhousing might allow for an increase in activity in that sectorover the short to medium term.  Plans for some majorregeneration and infrastructure projects had progressed further,though the effects of those would largely be felt in years tocome. 
Credit conditions
The cost of credit had fallen for many companies, though thiswas yet to generate any material increase in lending.  Falls inloan pricing would take time to feed through to actualborrowing costs as existing lending was reviewed and repricedgradually over time.  And banking contacts reported that somesmaller companies might not see lower costs because lenderswere seeking to increase the differentiation of loan pricingacross the small and medium-sized enterprise sector.  Smallercompanies and firms in those sectors perceived to be of highercredit risk were yet to report any material increase in creditavailability or in banks’ risk appetite.  More generally, banklending for new activities or expansion was reported to bemuch harder to find than funding for ‘business as usual’.  Theavailability of non-bank finance also appeared to be easingfurther, as reflected by very recent evidence of an improvedfunctioning of the initial public offering (IPO) market.  Demandfor bank lending was still reported to be weak, with manycompanies looking to reduce debts or build up cash reserves.While that often reflected precautionary motives, in a graduallyincreasing number of cases contacts reported accumulatingcash for potential future investment or acquisitions activity.There were continued reports of a decrease in forbearance bybanks on commercial property lending.  
Employment 
Employment intentions in business services had continued torise slightly ( Chart 4 ).  That primarily reflected developments
in professional and financial services, where there had beensome increase in business turnover.  Plans for increasedemployment often focused on firms that were winning orattempting to win market share, for example through lookingto invest in staff to cover new specialisms, while those4 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 4

–Chart 3 Business services turnovercompanies that were losing market share were slow to adjust
employment levels downwards and lose specialist staff.  Inslight contrast, consumer services employment plans werestable.   Manufacturing employment intentions had alsoremained broadly flat, with current workforces seen to beconsistent with expectations of gently rising output to come.Recruitment difficulties had continued to be limited, thoughskills shortages were said to be increasing in IT, with somecompanies said to be actively recruiting abroad for specialists.The availability of engineering skills remained tight, thoughthere were some reports of an increasing use of apprenticeshipschemes starting to mitigate constraints in some areas. 
Capacity utilisation
Capacity utilisation had remained a little below normal in bothmanufacturing and services.  Within manufacturing, sometightness was reported in high-tech engineering, luxury carsupply chains and aerospace, with the degree of slack reportedto be greatest for consumer and heavy construction productsand printing, mirroring the pattern of demand.  Within businessservices, professional services reported only limited amounts ofspare capacity, though the picture often remained one of staffworking hard to maintain output in an environment of weakdemand, and there were continued reports of gradualconsolidation in the sector.  Spare capacity remained mostobvious in the retail and heavy construction sectors, reflectedin a gradual closing of unprofitable stores in the former, andsome increased reports of mothballing of capacity in the latter.  
Costs and prices
Labour costs
The annual rate of growth in labour costs per employee hadremained subdued.  Wage inflation had remained low, withincreases in pay typically related to company performance andindividual merit, rather than general labour market pressures.Pension costs were reported to be increasing, in part reflectingauto-enrolment, which involved some set-up costs and ongoingcontributions that were expected to rise over time.  In addition,legacy liabilities for some firms with defined benefit schemes
were said to have increased following triennial revaluations.There were mixed reports about the size of companies’expected bonus payments, but in the financial sector thesewere expected to be significantly down on last year.  
Non-labour costs
The rate of inflation in materials costs and imported finishedgoods prices was reported to be unchanged.  Costs continuedto be driven up by energy price rises and the effects of earlieragricultural commodity price rises, both directly and indirectlythrough the effect on other goods.  Some contacts reportedthat sterling’s recent depreciation had started to put upwardpressure on costs and would feed through with the usual lagsdue to hedging and forward purchases.  Those factors had beenoffset in part by a weakening in some other input prices,including steel, newsprint, timber and some packaging.Contacts also noted continued upwards pressure from Chinesewage inflation and shipping costs, partly offset by re-sourcingto countries that had a lower cost base or were closer to home,with some contacts seeking UK suppliers.    
Output prices and margins
Manufacturers’ and business services output price inflation waslittle changed, remaining muted.  Some manufacturers werepassing through input price rises by less than their full extent.Excess capacity and increasingly open procurement werebearing down on business services prices, though there hadbeen a slight increase in reports of professional services firmsbeing able to pass on wage rises to fees.  Some commercialproperty rents were reported to be flattening after a period ofdecline.  Margins were reported to remain tight formanufacturing and services companies, though downwardpressure had abated for some professional services firms asdemand for more complex advisory services had started toclimb.  
Consumer prices
The annual rate of consumer price inflation was reported tohave edged up for goods and, to a slightly greater extent, forservices.  The slight increase for goods price inflation was said
to reflect higher fuel, food and alcohol prices.  Some contactsexpected food prices to rise further, as limits to discounting ledto a fuller pass-through of price increases in the supply chain.However, inflation in household goods was subdued, with somecontacts reporting that prices for clothing, footwear andfurniture were little changed on a year earlier.  In services, somecontacts reported an increase in administered prices in publictransport, though those prices determined by a mark-up onretail price inflation were increasing at a slower rate than a yearearlier.  There were also reports that food and alcohol priceincreases were being passed through — at least in part — inrestaurant and bar prices, and that higher fuel costs werecoming though indirectly.  Against that, insurance premia weresaid to be falling due to pressure from online comparison sites.   4
