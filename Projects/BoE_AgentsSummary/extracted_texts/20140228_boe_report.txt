February 2014Demand
Consumption
Growth in retail sales values in the past three months on a year
earlier had been little changed.  Following a slow start toDecember, retail sales growth had strengthened significantly inthe second half of the month, with consumers reported tohave delayed spending in expectation of discounting in theimmediate run-up to Christmas.  Sales through ‘click andcollect’ had grown strongly, to some extent at the expense ofother types of transactions.  There were continued reports ofrising demand for household durables, partly linked to risinghousing market activity.  New car sales growth was reportedto have remained buoyant, though the pace of growth wasseen by some contacts to be easing.  More generally, themajority of retail contacts anticipated modest sales growth inthe coming months, given perceptions of continuing tightnessin many consumers’ disposable incomes.  Growth in consumerservices turnover had edged up further.  Reports from providersof leisure services had been more consistently positive over thefestive period than for retailers, with hotels, restaurants andcoffee shops reporting an increase in sales growth.  Somerecovery in growth in non-leisure services, such as car servicingwas also reported.  Consumer services contacts expectedcontinued moderate growth during the year ahead, given forexample the pattern of forward booking seen by hoteliers andtravel agents.
Housing market
Housing market activity had continued to strengthen acrossthe country, as confidence and mortgage availability improved.Sales of both new and existing homes were well above thelevels of a year earlier, though remained generally belowpre-recession levels.  Growth in turnover amonghousing-related services, such as estate agency andconveyancing, had increased accordingly.  Estate agentsincreasingly reported shortages of properties available for sale,as instructions to sell failed to keep pace with buyer enquiries.As a result, the gap between asking and selling prices wasreported to be closing, though house price inflation outsideLondon was reported to have remained moderate.  Someestate agents expected an increase in instructions from vendorsto come as confidence in realising ‘target’ sale prices rose.
Business investment
Investment intentions had continued to strengthen gradually,pointing to a modest recovery in investment growth over thenext twelve months ( Chart 1 ).  Contacts remained focused on
investment to improve efficiency, particularly throughupdating IT systems and implementing energy savingtechnology.  But a growing number reported plans to increasecapacity, in both manufacturing and services, as firms becamemore confident about the medium-term outlook for demand.Consistent with that, there were increasing reports ofinvestment in the refurbishment or building of new
commercial property.  Continued robust investment spendingwas reported in North Sea oil and gas extraction.
Exports
Manufacturing export growth was reported to be steady andbroadly based across subsectors.  Robust growth was oftenreported to the United States and the Middle East, alongsidecontinued reports of gradual market share gains in someemerging economies.  But euro-area demand was reported tobe broadly flat.  The recent appreciation of sterling wasreported to have had little effect as yet on export volumes.In the services sector, there were reports of continuing exportsales growth among professional service providers such aslegal, architecture and accountancy firms.  That partlyreflected rising investment from overseas in bothUK commercial property and company acquisitions.Engineering and construction consultancy companies alsoreported growing exports, in particular to the Middle East andemerging economies.
Output
Business services
Annual growth in business services turnover had been littlechanged, having increased through 2013 ( Chart 2 ).  In
professional and financial services, accountancy and legal firmshad benefited from a continuing pickup in mergers andacquisitions, and initial public offering activity.  A range ofproperty-related service companies reported growing turnoverarising from increasing activity in property markets — bothresidential and commercial.  And a related increase in lendinghad also boosted output in some parts of the financial sector.Continued growth in recruitment, advertising and consultancywas reported as clients’ confidence strengthened.  In otherbusiness services, IT services growth had remained robust asfirms replaced ageing systems and invested in cloudcomputing, big data, digital marketing and cyber security.Wholesale, transport and logistics firms reported further2

modest increases in activity, particularly for companies
supporting housebuilding.  There were signs of recovery incorporate spending on training, conferences and events,though activity had remained restrained relative to thepre-crisis period.
Manufacturing
Output growth for the domestic market had risen furtheracross a broad range of subsectors.  Growth in automotive,engineering and energy-related supply chains had continued tobe robust, although there were reports that the rate of growthin aerospace supply chains might be easing as a weakening inspending on military aviation started to feed through.  Annualgrowth in construction materials output had picked up asproduction schedules were maintained over the winter and assome mothballed capacity had been bought back on stream.Printing output, however, had remained in decline.
Construction
Construction growth had increased a little further, following asharp pickup through 2013 ( Chart 2 ).  Housebuilding had
remained the major driving force behind growth in the sector,though a lack of development land, local planning delays, poorweather and difficulties in obtaining building materials wereacting to limit the pace of output growth.  Outside housing,there were a growing number of reports of an increase incommercial activity.  This was largely focused on pre-let orowner-occupied industrial development, large infrastructureprojects and some public sector work, especially in education.Speculative office development outside London had remainedvery subdued, however.
Credit conditions
Credit availability had continued to improve gradually acrossthe corporate sector, including for smaller companies.  Creditwas often reported to be readily available for large companiesand at a cost that was low by historical standards, givenconditions in capital and bank credit markets.  Some small
companies continued to report the opposite case, especiallywhere those companies had low levels of assets or someimpairment of their trading record.  But contacts generallyreported that competition to lend was increasing, withgrowing numbers being offered finance or changing bankingrelationships recently, and with ‘challenger banks’ andnon-bank finance providers gradually gaining market share.Some contacts noted that the number of sectors to whichbanks were reluctant to lend was gradually decreasing, thoughcompanies in property development, construction andhospitality sectors often continued to report that their accessto bank finance was patchy.  Demand for credit was reportedto be starting to increase, including from smaller companies.For large companies, however, that demand was often beingfilled by capital market finance or private placements wherethe maturities of funds available were longer.
Employment
Employment intentions had edged up a little further,indicating expectations of modest headcount growth acrossthe economy over the next six months.  Contacts’employment was often rising incrementally alongside gentleincreases in their productivity.  The main driver of employmentgrowth was increased economic activity, but there were alsogrowing reports of firms recruiting key skills ahead of need, inresponse to a pickup in attrition, and/or of hiring more traineesto address skill shortages, both of which were likely to act as adrag on productivity in the near term.  Recruitment difficultieshad ticked up a little further and were marginally abovenormal.  While it had remained generally easier than normal torecruit unskilled and semi-skilled workers, this was being morethan offset by a broadening of skill shortages beyond IT andengineering, to include construction and related services, arange of senior management positions, and qualifiedprofessional services staff.
Capacity utilisation
Capacity utilisation had edged higher in manufacturing on themonth and, overall, was close to normal levels ( Chart 3 ).
Utilisation of staff was often reported to be higher than forplant and equipment, contributing to rising employmentintentions.  In services, growth in employment had enabledprofessional and financial services companies to meet increaseddemand, so that capacity utilisation had been little changed onthe month.  In contrast, manufacturers had been more contentto meet rising demand by using existing resources moreintensively.  In house building, reports of constraints inconstruction products and labour continued, though materialsshortages had eased a little as some mothballed capacity hadbeen gradually brought back on stream.  In contrast, manyconsumer services firms reported ample spare capacity.Three months on the same period a year earlier

Labour costs
Growth in labour costs per employee had edged higher,
though remained moderate.  While the majority ofsettlements had remained around 2%–3%, the centraltendency had moved up a little within that range and thenumber of pay freezes had fallen back to the lowest level seenin recent years.  In general, pay increases were reported to beclosely aligned to developments in companies’ profitability.However, in some areas where there were some present oremerging skills shortages, there were rising numbers of reportsof higher, targeted pay increases to retain or attract key staff.Auto-enrolment pensions were contributing to upwardspressure on labour costs for some businesses, with only aminority intending to offset that effect through lower wagegrowth.  A box on page 5 summarises the results of the Agents’annual survey on pay and labour costs.
Non-labour costs
Materials cost inflation had fallen further ( Chart 4 ).  Most
companies reported that the principal cost components oftheir business had been flat or falling over recent months.  Themajor exceptions to this pattern were rising cost inflation forsome building aggregates and continued increases — albeitsometimes below expectations — in the cost of energy.Imported goods cost inflation had fallen in recent months,in part reflecting downwards pressure on the pricing of goodsfrom weak demand in the euro area.  Contacts expected thatsterling’s recent appreciation would put some furtherdownward pressure on import prices through the year, asannual contracts were repriced.
Output prices and margins
Output price inflation had been little changed, remainingsubdued.  Manufacturers and services providers continued toreport difficulty in raising prices, given strong competitivepressures.  But price inflation for house building products wererising, reflecting the strength of demand.  Profitability hadcontinued to improve across manufacturing and services, in
part as stronger output growth had lowered unit costs andallowed companies to shift away from lower margin work.  Forsome manufacturers in particular, weakening materials priceinflation, alongside efforts to raise efficiency, had also boostedprofitability.  However, margins in both sectors remainedbelow long-term averages.
Consumer prices
Consumer price inflation had eased slightly further.  That hadreflected lower goods price inflation, in part as food priceinflation had fallen back following better domestic harvestsand lower global prices for basic agricultural goods.  Moregenerally, lower commodity prices and sterling’s recentappreciation were expected to bear down on goods priceinflation over coming months.  Expectations of inflationarypressure from energy prices had also abated recently.  In someleisure services, strengthening demand growth had allowed fora modest acceleration of prices.  But inflation in someadministered services prices indexed to the retail prices index(RPI), such as in public transport, had started to ease back asearlier falls in RPI inflation fed through.  Rail fare inflation hadalso been lowered by a reduction in the cap on averageregulated fare increases from 1% above the rate of RPI inflationto match that rate instead.  Insurance premia were oftenreported to be falling, though some upwards pressure onpremia for household insurance was expected following recentflooding.  In general, contacts reported that squeezeddisposable incomes continued to restrain inflationary pressure.4

goodsAgents’ survey on pay and labour costs
The Agents have conducted an annual pay survey since 1998,
asking contacts in the private sector about their expected paysettlements for the year ahead, and the key drivers of anychanges to growth in total labour costs per employee.  Thisyear 449 firms responded, with a combined UK employment of986,000 staff.  The results of the survey have been weightedby employment.
The average pay settlement was expected to increase slightly
to 2.4% in 2014, from 2.2% in 2013 ( Chart A ).  These figures
remain well below pre-crisis growth rates and suggest thattotal pay growth is not expected to pick up significantly thisyear.  Looking across sectors, pay settlements in 2013 were alittle higher in construction than in other parts of theeconomy, and this differential was expected to widen a littlefurther in 2014.
This year’s survey, as for last year, saw a strong concentration
of expected settlements of between 2% and 3%, with thisrange capturing the expected 2014 settlement for nearly 80%of employees in the sample.  Fewer firms were expecting tofreeze pay in 2014 than in the previous year and, ifexpectations were realised, the proportion of companiesfreezing pay would be the lowest since the start of thefinancial crisis.  Around 10% of firms in the sample (covering5% of employees), reported collective wage bids for 2014,with no sign of a significant increase in those bids relative to2013.
The net balance of respondents expecting total labour costs
per employee to increase more rapidly in the coming year thanin the previous twelve months was a little higher than in lastyear’s survey, but remained modest ( Chart B ).  Across sectors,
expectations of changes in total labour costs per employeewere stronger for construction and business services than theywere for manufacturing.  Expectations for changes in labour
cost growth were weakest for consumer services, though stillconsistent with a slight pickup.
Respondents identified the need to retain key skills and recruit
staff as the most significant factor expected to increasegrowth in total labour costs per employee ( Chart C ).  Pressure
on real pay levels, including to ‘catch up’, was also a significantfactor this year.  Although employer pension contributionscontinued to increase total labour cost growth, it was a lesssignificant factor than last year.  That might partly reflect thatthe largest firms had adopted auto-enrolment — and soincorporated any associated increase in pension costs — duringthe previous year.  Consistent with the fall in consumer priceinflation seen during 2013, inflation expectations were themost significant downward influence on expected growth intotal labour costs per employee in 2014.Agents’ summary of business conditions February 2014 5
