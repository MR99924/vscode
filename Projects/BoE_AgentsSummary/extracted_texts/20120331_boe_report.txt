March 2012Demand
Consumption
Consumer demand continued to grow at only a gradual pace,
although for many contacts spending since the start of theyear had been a little more resilient than expected.  Growth ingoods volumes tended to be strongest in food, supported bywidespread promotional activity, although households wereincreasingly trying to cut down on waste, buying smaller packsizes and more frozen food, for instance.  Sales of clothing hadpicked up, due partly to deep discounting to clear stock.  And aperiod of particularly cold weather had helped to bolster salesof winter fashions.
Annual growth of spending on consumer services had also
edged a little higher this month.  That was in part due to risesin prices for certain essential services, such as transportationand rented accommodation.  But the volume of spending onservices had also risen a little, supported by promotionalactivity and discounting, which was becoming increasinglywidespread.  Households were also making greater use ofpublic transport, reflecting the rising costs of private travel.Spending on leisure activities continued to be weak.
Housing market
There had been some further improvement in the housingmarket, with fairly frequent reports of an increase in viewings,offers and transactions, although the level of activity remainedlow, and many areas had not seen a pickup.  Part of the rise indemand was thought to be due to the approaching end ofstamp duty relief for first-time buyers.  And there had beensome increase in the range of mortgages on offer, althoughmany first-time buyers continued to find it difficult to save adeposit, having to rent instead.  Buy-to-let investment hadrisen further, attracted by high rental yields, although somecontacts reported that the pace of increase in rents had slowedas more supply had become available.
Business investment
Investment intentions appeared to have risen a touch, but stillpointed to only modest growth in capital spending over thecoming year ( Chart 1 ).  Most firms continued to undertake
essential repair and replacement investment.  And many wereprepared to spend on projects that would generate fairly quickreturns:  efficiency gains through increased use of IT, orexpansion through online marketing, for instance.  Someinvestment which had been postponed due to worriesrelating to the euro area was also now back under way.  Manyexporters continued to invest in capacity to meet growingforeign demand, and a few businesses had been investing tobring parts of the production process back to theUnited Kingdom.  In the service sector, intentions werestrongest in growth industries, such as IT and energy-relatedconsultancy.  Investment plans elsewhere tended to be moremodest, and were typically motivated by the need to generateproductivity improvements or to meet changing regulatory
requirements.
Exports and imports
Goods exports continued to grow steadily ( Chart 2 ), although
the pace of expansion had been slowing in recent months.Some contacts suggested that destocking abroad, due toconcerns about the euro area, had caused much of thatslowing, and might now have run its course.  Activity wastypically most robust in emerging market economies.  But theUnited States had shown some signs of improvement, anddemand from Europe had not slowed as much as had beenfeared.  A rising number of firms reported that they wereexpanding into new markets, or were exporting for the firsttime.  This was the case in the service sector as well asmanufacturing.  Online fashion retail had been a particularsource of growth, along with engineering, management andenergy consultancy services.
Firms were increasingly reassessing the costs associated with
offshored production, reflecting a number of factors:  concernsabout quality;  delays in deliveries;  a rising preference forshorter production runs — which reduced the competitiveadvantage of high volume foreign suppliers;  rising productioncosts abroad;  and a greater awareness of the risk to supply2

chains following natural disasters last year in both Japan and
Thailand.  In some instances, firms were re-sourcing importsaway from distant, low-cost, countries, towards countriescloser to home, for example in the EU.  Domestic supplierswere winning some of this business as well.  And in some caseswhere there was no local supplier, firms were bringingproduction in-house altogether.
Output
Business services
The rate of growth in business services turnover remainedsluggish, with considerable variation across sectors.  Somesectors had benefited from the continued expansion of themanufacturing industry, for instance in haulage, while IT firmsalso continued to provide the expertise needed by a range ofdifferent businesses either to lower costs, or target the onlinemarket.  By contrast, in areas of oversupply, such asstandardised legal and accountancy services, growth inturnover was often reported to be slowing, with fees underrenewed downward pressure.  Uncertainty about the outlookhad also led many businesses to look again for any scope tocut non-essential expenditure, with contacts in corporatehospitality and suppliers of business travel noting a slowing inactivity.  And a fall in work for the public sector was also beingfelt by some service providers.
Manufacturing
Manufacturing output continued to grow at a modest pace.For those in export supply chains, activity was often growingquickly, for instance in the medical and pharmaceutical andautomotive industries.  And some of those firms that hadexperienced a slowing in activity towards the end of last year,as customers ran down stocks, were now seeing that processunwind.  A few firms also reported that output had beengrowing as a result of winning domestic market share at theexpense of foreign competitors.  But for businesses facing thedomestic consumer, activity was typically weak.  And thosesupplying the domestic construction and public sectors alsoreported that business conditions remained difficult.
Construction
The level of activity in the construction sector was slightlylower than a year earlier, in part due to a slowing in work forthe public sector.  Private sector activity had been fairly mixed.There was very little speculative office development outsideLondon.  And some of the large retailers had reduced theirplans for expansion, due to both weakness in demand and theexpectation that failures of other high street names wouldfree-up space in the secondary market.  But investment in railand utilities, ports, the energy sector, and warehousing anddistribution facilities continued to support activity.  There hadalso been an increase in private house building, althoughreduced grants had lowered the amount of social housingunder construction.Credit conditions
There had been a rise in the number of contacts reporting anincrease in spreads or fees when refinancing existing loans.And banks continued to encourage small businesses to useasset-backed forms of borrowing, rather than overdrafts.Business advisors suggested that some banks were averse tolending to smaller firms altogether, because of the highadministrative costs associated with small loans.  Some smallcompanies were now seeking alternative sources of funding,such as ‘angel finance’, from wealthy individuals, orpeer-to-peer arrangements.  There had been a tightening insupply chain finance, and a few contacts had noted a rise indebtor days.  Large firms and businesses with strong balancesheets typically had access to credit on reasonable terms,although many remained focused on paying down debt orstockpiling cash.
Employment
Employment intentions in the private sector pointed to stableemployment over the next six months.  In the manufacturingsector, some continued to plan to take on more staff to meetrising foreign demand, while others were holding off fromfurther recruitment due to uncertainty about the outlook, orhoped to meet future demand growth through increasedlabour productivity.  In business services, headcount wasexpected to continue to rise in growth areas, such as IT andenergy-related consultancy.  But past labour hoarding in somesectors, such as law and accountancy, and property, along witha further softening in expectations for activity in recentmonths, had led some contacts to revise their staffing needsdownward.  For businesses facing the consumer, firms withscope to lower headcount typically planned to do so, whileothers were making more use of flexible working practices,reducing opening hours or closing under performing stores.
Capacity utilisation
Capacity utilisation in manufacturing was a little belownormal, having fallen back from slightly above normal overrecent months ( Chart 3 ).  That was partly due to a slowing in
the rate of growth of demand, and also due to pastrecruitment and investment — and consequent increases inthe total capacity available.  Some firms, exporters inparticular, were operating at full capacity however, and evenwith additional investment in capital would probably findthemselves constrained by staff shortages.  In contrast, firmssupplying the domestic household and construction sectorsoften exhibited significant amounts of slack.  Businesses in theservice sector typically had more spare capacity thanmanufacturing firms, but there were signs of staffingconstraints developing in IT, reflecting continued rapid growthin the industry.  In the consumer sector, firms were increasinglyusing flexible working practices to try to tailor labour input to
match changes in demand.
Costs and prices
Labour costs
The rate of growth of total labour costs remained fairlymodest, with an increased sense of caution holding back payincreases in some sectors.  Settlements in manufacturing weretypically stronger than in services, particularly for engineers,reflecting rises in both profitability and labour productivity.  Inthe service sector, upward pressures on pay were generallyquite muted, reflecting weaker activity, and pay freezes hadonce again become common, especially in areas where stafftended to be underemployed, such as standardised legal andaccountancy services, and in property related businesses.There were still some areas where pay was growing rapidly,however, for instance in IT.  Across sectors there had been anincrease in the use of performance-related pay and bonuses, inorder to better match labour costs to activity, although thesize of bonus payments had tended to be lower than a yearearlier.
Non-labour costs
Materials cost inflation had edged down a little further, with aslowing in the pace of increase in the prices of a range of basicmaterials — food, cotton, and steel for instance ( Chart 4 ).  But
the use of forward contracts meant that this would take sometime to feed through fully to the prices paid by firms, andhigher energy costs were still being felt as long-term contractscame up for renewal.  Rising fuel costs were also a significantsource of cost increases for contacts in transport sectors, suchas haulage and travel.  And some contacts expressed concernabout the impact of renewed upward pressure on oil prices onvarious oil-based materials.  Inflation in the price of imports offinished goods had begun to slow over the past few months(Chart 4 ), reflecting the moderation in the pace of increase in
materials costs, as well as a marked decline in the cost ofshipping and a stronger sterling exchange rate.  But productioncosts continued to rise rapidly in some emerging market
economies, leading some firms to try to resource supplies fromelsewhere, or even bring production in-house.
Output prices
Manufacturing output price inflation remained elevated, buthad slowed a touch recently.  Many contacts continued topass on past increases in input costs, or were trying to hold onto cost reductions, in order to claw back lost margin fromearlier rises in costs which had not been passed on.  Theseefforts were met with varying degrees of success, however,with those firms supplying sectors where final demandremained weak tending to struggle to achieve any increase inprice.  But suppliers of some niche products were often able topass on much of any increase in costs.  In the service sector,specialist service providers, in IT, for instance, were typicallyable to raise prices, reflecting strong demand.  But theweakness of demand for many business services had putdownward pressure on fees, particularly in areas of oversupplysuch as corporate hospitality and standardised professionaland financial services.
Consumer prices
Annual inflation in consumer goods prices had slowed furtheron the month, reflecting the past increase in VAT falling out ofthe annual comparison, as well as recent reductions in the costof some utilities.  There had also been some downwardpressure on food price inflation, in part due to increasedcompetition among some of the large supermarkets.  Inflationin the price of clothing was expected to moderate goingforward, reflecting the decline in the cost of cotton comparedwith a year earlier.  Consumer services price inflation remainedelevated, although it had fallen back slightly.  For essentialservices, many businesses continued to raise prices, forinstance for telephony and insurance.  Rents and fares forpublic transport had also risen due to indexing to officialmeasures of inflation.  Household demand remained verysensitive to changes in the price of many discretionaryservices, however, tending to prevent firms from achievingsignificant increases.4
