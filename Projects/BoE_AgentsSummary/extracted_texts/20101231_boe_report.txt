December 2010Demand
Consumption
The Agents reported that the annual growth rate of the value
of retail sales remained broadly unchanged in November,having fallen back over the past few months ( Chart 1 ).
Promotions were still considered necessary to maintaindemand, with consumers still focused on value for money.Some contacts expected a boost to sales as some spendingwas brought forward ahead of the rise in VAT.  But there hadbeen relatively little sign of that happening so far.  And new carregistrations were generally reported to have weakened.
The annual growth rate of turnover in consumer services was
thought to be little changed compared to last month (Chart 1 ).  According to a number of contacts, the
entertainment sector was seeing some improvement indemand.  And spending by tourists continued to supportconsumer services.  Hoteliers in the south had seen reasonablegrowth in turnover, but the picture was rather weakerelsewhere. 
Housing market
Contacts reported that there had been a further slowing in thehousing market, with sales of both new and existing homesfalling back.  Confidence in the outlook for the economy, andso incomes, was increasingly felt to be weighing on demand.And there continued to be difficulties in obtaining mortgages,particularly for first-time buyers.  As a result of the decline inowner-occupier demand, the rental market remained buoyant.That had helped to support rents, which were in turngenerating an increase in interest from investors in buy-to-letproperty. 
Business investment
Investment intentions in both manufacturing and servicescontinued to point to a moderate increase in investment overthe next twelve months ( Chart 2 ).  And investment intentions
among manufacturers had risen a little.  Some of theimprovement in investment intentions in manufacturing
reflected the continued strength of exports in a number ofsectors.  And there were numerous reports of investment innew outlets and refurbishment of existing stores, due to theongoing expansion of some large retail chains.  Contacts’efforts to raise efficiency were also a significant driver ofspending, with much of the planned investment being in IT.And for a number of businesses, there was a need forreplacement investment and to develop new products.
Exports
The annual rate of growth of the value of exports remainedelevated, in large part due to the strength of trade in goods.Automotive, aerospace and chemical sectors were key driversof growth.  The performance of exports was thought to beprimarily a function of global demand, particularly in emergingmarkets, rather than the past depreciation of sterling.  Demandin some parts of Europe had begun to strengthen, butremained weak in others.  And demand from the United Stateshad also been picking up.  Exports of services continued to besupported by the intake of overseas students and inwardtourism.  Contacts in both manufacturing and services withexposure to utilities and infrastructure projects abroad hadalso seen a rise in activity.
Import growth remained fairly strong, and there was still
relatively little evidence that UK firms were switching towardsdomestic suppliers.  The need to avoid disruption in supplychains was a concern, however, with several contacts reportingthat orders of inputs had been diverted to other markets.  Butit was difficult to source those inputs domestically.
Output
Business services
The experience of contacts in professional and businessservices was very mixed.  The Agents’ score for annual growthin turnover continued to point to modest growth, although it2

had fallen slightly on the month.  There was still significant
downward pressure on fees — in part reflecting the efforts ofpublic sector bodies to reduce costs, which were widelyreported — and as a result, volumes may have risen rathermore quickly than values.  The provision of IT servicescontinued to be a bright spot, and was possibly linked toinvestment expenditures to raise efficiency.
The Agents’ score for other business services was broadly
unchanged, and indicated only a moderate rate of growth.There had been a rise in the growth rate of turnover for firmssupplying services to manufacturers, such as warehousing,logistics, and haulage.  And contacts in hospitality andconferencing had benefitted from rising activity in the widereconomy, although the impact of government savingsmeasures had been felt there too.  
Manufacturing
Manufacturing continued to grow robustly.  The Agents’ scoresfor both export and domestic manufactures ticked down alittle, as very strong growth in the early stages of the recoveryhad dropped out of the annual comparison.  Exports continuedto be the primary driver of growth, but there were morereports of domestic demand beginning to contribute to therecovery.  Growth in manufacturing output had beenunderpinned by the aerospace and automotive industries, andactivity related to utilities and infrastructure projects.Contacts in the defence industry with exposures to thegovernment had cut back on production and were concernedabout the outlook. 
Construction
The Agents’ score for construction signalled that activity hadrisen compared with the same period last year ( Chart 3 ).  That
was the first positive reading for annual growth since aroundthe start of the recession.  Construction projects in London,related to the Olympics, transportation and some sizablecommercial developments, appeared to be responsible for partof the improvement in the sector.  A number of contacts hadseen a lift from utilities and infrastructure work.  And fit-outsof new retail premises and home improvement had also
contributed.  Government spending was supportive of currentactivity, but was not expected to remain so next year.
Credit conditions 
Credit conditions continued to improve for large firms,although contacts in sectors related to property still haddifficulties securing external finance.  Small firms of all typesreported that credit conditions remained very tight, both interms of cost and availability.  And there were further reportsof overdrafts being withdrawn and of long delays waitingbefore decisions were made on loans.
According to contacts, lenders had in some instances moved
away from offering overdrafts, in favour of types of financingthat posed less risk to their balance sheets, such as invoicediscounting.  Small firms appeared to be less able than largeones to accommodate that switch.  Small firms often foundthe application process prohibitively costly in terms of timeand resource, or were discouraged by what were felt to beoverly stringent collateral requirements.  Contacts also feltthat the use of credit scoring had limited the scope for localbank managers to use discretion when agreeing loans.  Thathad contributed further to small firms’ difficulties in securingfinance.
Employment
Employment intentions in the consumer sector had picked up,driven by the need to staff new openings of retail outlets.Employment intentions in manufacturing had also risen alittle, and remained above average.  Business servicesemployment intentions had edged down, and weresignificantly below pre-recession levels.  There had been somerecruitment by the financial sector, but law firms werereducing back-office numbers.  Contacts remained cautiousabout hiring, and had made increased use of part time andtemporary staff.  
There was a small rise in the Agents’ score for recruitment
difficulties, although it remained well below normal.  A fewcontacts mentioned shortages of certain skills, particularly inIT and engineering.  And several contacts reported that theywere making increased use of apprenticeships to meet skillsgaps.
Capacity utilisation
The Agents’ score for capacity utilisation in manufacturingcontinued to rise toward zero, which indicates a ‘comfortable’level of spare capacity — that is, a level of spare capacity atwhich firms are confident that they could meet expectedchanges in demand over the next six months ( Chart 4 ).

–+Three months on same period a year earlierChart 3 Construction outputMeanwhile, the score for services fell back a touch, and
suggested slightly more spare capacity in the sector.  Broadlyspeaking, contacts felt that they could meet a rise in activityrelatively easily with existing staff.  But a few contacts inmanufacturing and related services were at full capacity.  Andthere was widespread mention of component shortages due toglobal supply constraints.
Costs and prices
Labour costs
Labour cost growth had risen further in manufacturing and wasapproaching the average rate.  Labour costs continued to growat a slightly slower pace in services.  The increase in labourcosts was partly due to the reinstatement of shifts andovertime, as well as to pay increases on the back of risingproductivity.  In addition, some employers had rewarded stafffor their loyalty following a period of wage restraint.  Andunions had been able to exert a little more pressure in somewage negotiations.  There were fewer incidences of pay freezes,and a number of contacts had adjusted pay scales followingthe increase in the national minimum wage.  But settlementswere rarely linked to inflation, with employees mindful ofcompetition in the job market.
Non-labour costs
Materials cost inflation remained robust, with rapid increasesin the prices of agricultural commodities, plastics, wood, paper,cotton and wool, and metals.  A pickup in the price of feed hadpushed up on the cost of meat and poultry.  The annual rate ofinflation for imported finished goods ticked up, but was stillslightly lower than for materials.  Freight shipping and
transportation costs were driving price increases.  And somecontacts thought that quotas on exports of certain rare metalsfrom China had begun to feed through to the price of some ofthe electrical components that required them.  And the priceof imports of clothing had begun to reflect the rise in the costof cotton.
Output prices
Manufacturing output price inflation rose a little, but remainedfairly subdued.  Contacts had been able to pass on some of theincreases in costs, particularly when materials comprised amajor part of the cost base, or when increases were widelyknown to have been large.  But retailers had vigorously resistedattempts by food producers to pass on much of the rise in theircosts.
In services, competitive pressures were still exerting a
downward influence on prices, particularly for professionalservices of a broadly homogenous or ‘commoditised’ nature,such as audit.  And there were further reports of public sectorbodies renegotiating contracts to secure work at a lower cost.But there were certain niche services where firms had beenable to exert a little more pricing power.  And hauliers hadbeen passing on higher fuel costs.
Consumer prices
The Agents score for consumer goods inflation had risen alittle, but it still pointed to a rate of increase that was aroundthe historical average.  The Agents’ score for consumer serviceswas unchanged, and suggested a slightly slower pace of pricerises.  There had been some pass through of recent increases inthe cost of imported finished goods.  Where supermarkets hadbeen unsuccessful in keeping down costs, they had beentending to pass them on to consumers.  Rather than raiseprices, restaurants had reworked menus to cut spending oningredients.  Air fares had gone up, along with motor andbuildings insurance premiums.
Contacts still intended to pass on the bulk of the rise in VAT.
Most of the increase would occur during the first few monthsof next year, but some had happened already.  A few contacts,typically those that expected a large response in demand toany price change, intended to delay passing on the tax rise, orplanned to absorb part of it.4
