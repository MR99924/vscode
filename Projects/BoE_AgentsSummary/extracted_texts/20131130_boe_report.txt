November 2013Demand
Consumption
Growth in the value of retail sales and consumer services, in
the past three months on a year earlier, had been unchanged(Chart 1 ).  However, retail sales growth had appeared to
soften in recent weeks, in part as mild weather in autumn hadadversely affected sales of seasonal ranges of clothing andfootwear.  That had followed a summer when spending hadbeen boosted by good weather.  Contacts reported a gradualincrease in consumer confidence, though consumption growthcontinued to be restrained by tight disposable incomes.  Therehad been signs of increasing growth for some householddurable goods, potentially related to rising housingtransactions.  Growth in new car sales remained robust,reflecting discounting and cheap finance deals with lowmonthly payments.  Consumer services turnover growth hadremained steady, buoyed by good weather and a gradualincrease in consumers’ discretionary spending.
Housing market
Housing market activity had picked up significantly, thoughremained below pre-crisis levels.  Demand for housing hadcontinued to gain momentum due to improved mortgageavailability, rising household confidence and the Help to Buyscheme.  Buy-to-let demand was said to have remained firm,given the low yields available on other investments andinflows of investment from overseas buyers, sometimesseeking a safe haven for funds.  There were reports oftransactions being delayed by capacity constraints within firmsof surveyors, mortgage brokers and conveyancing solicitors.House price inflation was said to have remained modest acrossmost parts of the United Kingdom, though there had beensome spread of house price rises from London to a number ofsurrounding areas in the South of England, and a few wealthylocations elsewhere.
Business investment
Investment intentions in both manufacturing and services hadcontinued to point to modest growth in capital spending overthe next twelve months.  Manufacturing investment had often
remained aimed at efficiency gains, or the replacement ofageing assets, though there were increasing reports of capacityexpansion, for example in the energy, automotive andconstruction sectors.  In services, investment continued to bedominated by IT spending, as systems were renewed or theinterface with customers improved.  Some consumer-facingbusinesses were reported to be increasing investment toimprove their branding or to refurbish stores, though in lessprofitable parts of the sector, stores were being closed.  Acrosssectors, there were reports of contacts looking to expandthrough acquisitions activity, rather than organically, thoughthat process might lead to some increase in investment in duecourse as operations were merged.
Exports
Growth in manufacturing exports continued at a steady rate.There were further reports of growth in manufacturing exportsto the United States, with only isolated reports of adverseeffects from the federal government shutdown.  Exportdemand from the Middle East and emerging marketscontinued to grow.  Euro-area demand was said to havestabilised overall, but at a low level.  A balance of contactsexpected limited impact on exports from the recentappreciation of sterling, either because they were not directlycompeting on price or because efforts to build stronger exportnetworks were providing a greater positive impetus.  However,a minority reported a dampening effect on the pace of theirexports growth.  Growth in services exports was reported tohave continued, often led by demand for consultancy servicesrelated to construction and energy projects in the Middle East,or from rising tourism from overseas.
Output
Business services
Growth in business services turnover had risen further(Chart 2 ), with a broadening of growth across subsectors.

–Chart 2 Manufacturing, business services and
construction activityand acquisitions, corporate finance and property transactions
had risen, in some cases said to be based around clients’preparations for future business growth.  Wealth managementactivity was reported to have picked up as investors soughthigher returns than savings rates offered by banks.Strengthening demand in the economy was translating intohigher usage of IT service providers, marketing companies andrecruitment consultants.  A range of other service providersrelated to the construction industry, such as hauliers andbuilders merchants, reported increased rates of turnovergrowth as construction activity picked up.  Growth in businesstravel had also picked up, though spending on corporatehospitality had remained constrained.
Manufacturing
Output growth for the domestic market had edged higher(Chart 2 ).  The recent strengthening had partly reflected
increased growth in the manufacture of construction productsrelated to the building and ‘fitting out’ of new homes.Manufacturers of consumer durables also reported somestrengthening of output growth.  That, alongside strongdomestic and export growth of automotive products, hadstarted to feed through to the output of some metals andplastics producers.  The level of steel production, however, hadremained weak.  Export growth in aerospace, food,pharmaceutical and energy-related products had continued tocontribute positively to output growth in domestic supplychains.
Construction
Annual growth in output had continued to recover from aprolonged period of weakness ( Chart 2 ).  Private
house-building activity had accelerated, and social housingstarts as well as new student accommodation were alsosupporting growth.  Housebuilding rates were expected to risefurther as supply responded to increased demand, though theresponse would come with a lag, in part reflecting constraintssaid to include shortages of construction skills, capacity limitsin construction material production, staff shortages in localauthority planning departments, and difficulties in accessingcredit for some smaller housebuilders.  Smaller scalerefurbishment of commercial premises had continued to grow.But commercial development activity outside Londonremained subdued overall.  A number of infrastructure projectshad continued to provide support to the sector.
Credit conditions
The availability of credit to companies continued to increasegradually.  Credit was readily available to large corporates,either through bank lending or capital markets.  Availabilityhad eased a little for medium and small-sized businesses, insome cases with greater competition reported betweenlenders and with some evidence of new entrants to the marketfrom overseas.  But many small companies continued to reporthigh collateral requirements — or loan pricing that was high
given levels of collateralisation.  There were reports of someimprovement in access to finance for residential and otherproperty developers, often from non-bank sources, includingprivate investors, insurance companies or overseas funds.Credit demand was also reported to be gently rising to helpfund mergers and acquisitions and management buyoutactivity.  However, many contacts remained reluctant toapproach banks for new funds, given a continuing lack of trustin banking relationships.  Non-bank finance continued to grow,including a rising use of supply chain finance.  However, therewere continuing reports of lengthening payment times, puttingsome smaller companies’ cash flow under pressure.
Employment
Employment intentions had edged higher and were consistentwith modest employment growth over the next six months(Chart 3 ).  Employment intentions remained weaker than
turnover or output growth across sectors, indicating risingproductivity.  The majority of manufacturing firms were notintending to make significant increases in their headcount,partly reflecting the scope for productivity gains throughincreased efficiency or automation.  For professional services,increasing employment was often concentrated among newentrants or junior staff, aimed at restraining labour costgrowth.  But the scope for productivity gains in the short termappeared somewhat more limited than for manufacturing, asthe aftermath of the crisis had seen a persistent step up in theamount of labour required to win business in the sector — forexample due to tighter procurement processes.  In consumerservices, estate agents were reported to be starting to increasestaff numbers, often from ‘skeletal’ levels, and some retailchains were hiring sales staff, albeit partly offset by reductionsin back-office staffing.  Reports of recruitment difficulties forskilled labour were becoming more widespread across theeconomy, including in construction trades, for conveyancingsolicitors, mid-ranking professional and managerial staff anddrivers of large commercial vehicles, in addition tolong-standing difficulties in IT and engineering.

–ScoresChart 3 Employment intentionsemployment was reported to have risen, albeit from a low
level.  However, the ease of recruiting unskilled andadministrative staff meant overall difficulties had remainedslightly below normal ( Chart 4 ).
Capacity utilisation
Capacity utilisation was approaching normal levels in
manufacturing and services, as activity in the economyincreased ( Chart 5 ).  In manufacturing, most companies
thought they could respond readily to higher demand fromexisting capacity, increased agency labour or the use ofadditional shifts.  Within services, the degree of spare capacitywas greater in consumer services than for business services,where little slack was often reported.  Capacity constraintswere generally yet to bite in manufacturing or services.  Inconstruction, however, skills and materials were said to beacting as a mild brake on the rate of growth of output.Shortages in materials were expected by some contacts to berelatively short-lived, though producers needed to besufficiently convinced of a sustained recovery before incurringthe sizable costs of restarting mothballed capacity or addingnew capacity.  Some contacts expected increasing immigrant labour to help meet shortfalls in construction skills over time,
although the lags in response were uncertain and there hadbeen little evidence of such inflows so far.
Costs and prices
Labour costs
The annual rate of growth in labour costs remained moderateand unchanged, but there were continued reports of buildingpressure on pay for some skills in short supply.  Pay risescontinued to remain clustered around the 2%–3% range, withmanufacturing and professional services often at the top of therange and consumer services employees towards the bottom.In some skills, there were localised pay awards notably abovethat range, including for some construction workers, in oil andgas expertise, IT and engineering.  Auto-enrolment wasreported to be a potential source of future upwards pressureon labour costs, though a minority expected to bear down onpay increases in response.
Non-labour costs
Inflation in materials costs had remained muted.  With pricepressures for most materials generally subdued, contacts’concerns often centred around growth in overhead costs —most notably utilities and business rates.  There were alsoreports of upwards pressure on the price of some constructionmaterials, such as bricks, as growth in demand outstrippedgrowth in supply.  Imported finished goods price inflation hadremained modest, with price rises often reflecting the impactof rising Chinese labour costs, offset to some extent by theresourcing of products by importers.
Output prices and margins
Output price inflation had remained subdued, though hadedged up for business services.  Rising demand for some highervalue added business services — such as advisory work — hadallowed a modest increase in prices in that sector.  But moregenerally, companies reported that they were reluctant to raiseprices beyond passing on modest cost increases, due to the riskof either losing customers or triggering new tender processes.Growth in profitability had edged up from a low base,reflecting rising sales volumes and efforts to reduce costs.
Consumer prices
Consumer prices had continued to rise at a moderate annualrate.  Administered and regulated prices, such as energy andtransport prices, continued to be significant contributors toinflation.  Food price inflation had persisted for some productsbut was expected to slow next year following stronger globalharvests.  There were reports of overhangs of autumn fashionstocks, reflecting the mild weather, which might lead to earlysales discounting.  More generally, retailers reported that thehigh price sensitivity of consumers continued to restrain theirability to raise prices.4
