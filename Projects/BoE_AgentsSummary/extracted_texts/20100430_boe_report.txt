Consumer spending growth had softened slightly relative to the rates recorded at the end of 2009.
The imbalance between demand and supply in the housing market had corrected further.  House prices,
which had been rising for a number of months, appeared to have stabilised.
 Investment intentions had picked up a little, but remained subdued.
 Export growth had continued to recover gradually.
 Business services output was reported to have picked up, mainly reflecting stronger demand for
professional and financial services.  Manufacturing output had continued to recover gradually, mainly
reflecting stronger exports.
By contrast, output in the construction sector remained depressed.
The availability of bank lending had improved a touch.  Competition in the banking sector was reported
to have increased, as some foreign banks had entered, or re-entered the market.
There remained a significant margin of spare capacity in the economy, which could be mobilised
relatively quickly were demand conditions to warrant it.
 Employment intentions had remained stable.  Few businesses were planning to increase headcount, but
most major redundancy programmes appear to have been completed. 
 Pay pressures remained muted, but reports of pay freezes had become less widespread than in 2009. 
 Non-labour costs had continued to rise, reflecting increases in metals prices and transport costs.
Imported finished goods prices had also picked up a little.
 Consumer price inflation had stabilised.  Contacts reported that the rise in VAT had now been passed
through by the majority of those planning to do so.

April 2010Demand
Consumption
The Agents’ sense was that annual retail sales values growth
had softened slightly and that spending on consumer serviceshad also flattened off ( Chart 1 ).  But contacts had continued
to find it hard to ascertain the underlying trend in consumerspending.  The rise in VAT may have boosted spending in 2009 Q4 at the expense of 2010 Q1.  And both changes in thepattern of discounting and the inclement weather (in early2010 and in February 2009) had made interpreting annualcomparisons difficult.  Looking ahead, retailers thought thatboth announced and expected tax increases, coupled with thepossibility of a further reduction in employment (particularlyin the public sector) would weigh on consumer spending.
Sales of new cars had been strong over the past year, reflecting
the substantial boost provided by the car scrappage scheme.Although the scheme’s expiry at the end of March had givenrise to some concerns of a sharp fall in car sales, a number ofcontacts were less pessimistic.  Some dealers had introducedpromotional schemes of their own to smooth the adjustment.Others thought that the scheme had not simply broughtforward planned expenditure, and so were more sanguineabout the outlook for sales over the remainder of 2010.
Housing market
The lack of mortgage finance, particularly at higher loan tovalue ratios, had continued to deter potential homebuyers.  Aslight increase in new instructions had, however, reduced theimbalance between demand and supply.  As a result, theAgents’ sense was that house prices, which had been rising inrecent months, had stabilised.
Business investment
Investment intentions remained subdued — the Agents’ scores(Chart 2 ) suggested that the monthly flows of spending over
the coming year would be close to those seen in recentmonths.  The wide margin of spare capacity, tight credit
conditions and uncertainty about future demand and plans forpublic spending and capital allowances had continued torestrain investment plans.  
Set against that, however, there have been tentative signs that
some businesses were considering resuming routinemaintenance work, or increasing investment to improveproductivity and reduce costs.  And a few contacts hadconsidered investing in new products, in preparation for anupturn in demand.
Exports
Looking through the impact of the inclement weather, exportsales were reported to have risen only gradually during early2010.  Although external demand had continued to pick up,that mainly reflected growth in Asian markets, which accountfor only a small share of total UK exports.  Demand in theUnited Kingdom’s main trading partners — the euro area andthe United States — remained subdued.  
Inventories
The majority of contacts reported that reductions in inventorylevels had been largely completed by 2009 Q4, following rapidde-stocking earlier in the year.  Concerns about the pace of therecovery in demand, along with restricted access to financeand the importance of preserving cash, were expected to keepstocks low relative to sales.  
Output
Business services
Demand for professional and financial services had continuedto recover, prompting a further rise in the Agents’ scores(Chart 3 ).  In part, that recovery reflected stronger demand for
property-related services, following an increase in commercialproperty investment transactions during late 2009.  Butdemand for legal services had also risen, as had demand for2

consultancy services (aimed primarily at cutting costs).  M&A
and corporate finance activity had also picked up slightly,albeit from a very low base.  The recovery in other businessservices activity had, however, remained patchy, and turnoverremained below its level a year earlier ( Chart 3 ), as businesses
continued to manage their overheads tightly. 
Manufacturing
Looking through the volatility in the early months of 2010, theAgents’ sense was that manufacturing output had continuedto recover, prompting a further increase in the Agents’ scores.Manufacture of food was strong, and demand for chemicalsand pharmaceuticals had also picked up.  Manufacturerssupplying the construction sector, however, continued to facevery weak demand.  
Construction
Output in the construction sector remained depressed,although there were some signs that activity had stabilised inrecent months.  New homebuilding had picked up slightly, andrepair and maintenance activity had increased, spurred on bythe impact of the snow on buildings and transport networks.But these increases in demand had been offset by furtherweakness in commercial property construction, where thepipeline was shortening rapidly as projects were completedand not replaced.
Looking ahead, contacts in this sector remained particularly
concerned about the impact of cuts in public spending, giventhe support provided by public sector projects over the pastyear. 
Credit conditions
On balance, the Agents’ sense was that the availability ofcredit had improved slightly, in part reflecting an increase incompetition as foreign banks began to enter, or re-enter themarket.  But conditions remained both tight and polarised,with large and less risky businesses finding it easier to obtain
credit than their smaller or riskier counterparts.  Spreads andfees also appeared to have stabilised (albeit at high levels).The availability of trade credit insurance had improvedmarginally in recent months, although the level of coveravailable remained low, prompting many businesses to takerisk onto their own books.  Demand for bank finance remainedweak, with many companies continuing to repay debt, andlarge businesses resorting to the capital markets for theirfinancing needs.
Employment
The outlook for private sector employment appeared relativelystable ( Chart 4 ), with most large-scale redundancy
programmes having been completed.  Intentions weremarginally stronger in the professional services andmanufacturing sectors, where short-time working had beenlargely reversed and a few businesses were starting to recruitselectively in anticipation of a further rise in demand.  Incontrast, the employment outlook in the construction andpublic sectors remained downbeat, reflecting the likely impactof the forthcoming fiscal consolidation.
Capacity utilisation
The recent pickup in some firms’ sales had led to a gentle risein capacity utilisation.  Nonetheless, there remained asignificant margin of spare capacity in the economy ( Chart 4 ),
which could be deployed relatively swiftly should demandconditions warrant it (see box).  Significant increases in outputwere more likely to require additional labour input thaninvestment, but the majority of businesses felt confident thatthey would be able to fill positions quickly, given the deep poolof available labour.

Labour costs
Overall, pay pressures remained muted.  But reports of pay
freezes had become less widespread and the prevalence ofpositive (but low) pay awards had risen slightly relative to2009.  In most cases, that slight increase in pay was aimed atrewarding better trading performance or at recognisingemployees’ loyalty and boosting morale.  
There was slightly more upward pressure on firms’ total labour
costs, reflecting both the restoration of full-time working andincreased pension contributions, particularly among thosecompanies with defined benefit schemes.
Non-labour costs
Raw materials costs continued to rise, prompting a furtherincrease in the Agents’ scores ( Chart 5 ).  Prices of globally
traded commodities, such as steel, fuel and cotton, had risenfurther, in part on the back of higher demand from emergingeconomies.  And transport and freight costs had picked upsharply, reflecting earlier reductions in global capacity as shipsand container vessels were temporarily taken out of service.Imported finished goods prices also moved higher.
Output prices
Manufacturing output prices had risen slightly this month(Chart 5 ).  Many contacts attributed these rises to the increase
in input costs, which in some cases have fed through to pricesautomatically due to escalator clauses in customer contracts.That had served to offset, in part, the downward impact of themargin of spare capacity and the desire to gain market share.Annual business service price inflation remained negative,
reflecting the significant margin of spare capacity and thestrong degree of competition it had fostered.  Prices in theconstruction sector had continued to decline.
Consumer prices
Retail prices remained well above their level a year earlier,reflecting the impact of higher VAT and fuel prices.  But therate of inflation appeared to have stabilised, and the Agents’scores were unchanged in March.  Contacts reported that therise in VAT had now been passed through by the majority ofthose planning to do so.  Looking ahead, contacts noted thatthe combination of strong competition and price-sensitiveconsumers were expected to limit the scope for further priceincreases.   4

–Agents’ survey on spare capacity and output
prices
The fall in nominal spending over the past 18 months is likely
to have resulted in a significant shortfall in demand relative tosupply capacity, which should result in downward pressure oninflation.  But the extent of that spare capacity, its likelypersistence, and its likely impact on inflation, are all difficult tojudge.  
As a result, the Agents surveyed contacts about the margin of
spare capacity in their business, the speed with which it couldbe mobilised, and the extent to which it is expected to affecttheir output prices in 2010.  Around 350 businesses respondedto the survey.  All figures shown are weighted by employment.  
The survey results suggest that there remained a significant
degree of spare capacity in the economy ( Chart A ).  Those
companies operating in the manufacturing and constructionsectors reported the most spare capacity, while those inservices, especially consumer services, were more likely to beoperating at or around capacity.
The results also suggested that the margin of spare capacity
could be mobilised relatively quickly.  For example, themajority of businesses could increase output materiallywithout additional investment and (to a lesser extent)recruitment ( Chart B ).  And of the 60% of companies
operating below pre-recession levels of production, nearlythree-quarters thought they could recover the falls in outputwithin six months, if demand was forthcoming.On balance, contacts reported that the margin of spare
capacity was expected to push down output prices during2010.  The margin of spare capacity, however, was only onefactor influencing businesses’ output price expectations.  Onbalance, contacts reported that the desire to gain market sharewas also pushing down expected output prices.  That wasoffset, however, by the impact of higher input prices and thedesire to rebuild margins ( Table 1 ), which had been squeezed
following a sharp rise in costs during 2008.  
Overall, just over half of contacts expected their output prices
to remain broadly unchanged during 2010.  Of the remainder,around 30% expected prices to rise, compared with around15% who expected them to fall.  The majority of businessesexpecting prices to rise were concentrated in the consumerservices sector, where there was relatively little spare capacity.Firms in the manufacturing and construction sector were morelikely to expect falls in prices during 2010.Agents’ summary of business conditions April 2010 5
