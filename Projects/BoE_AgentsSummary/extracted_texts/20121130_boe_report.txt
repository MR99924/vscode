November 2012Demand
Consumption
Retail sales growth had picked up very modestly during the
month ( Chart 1 ).  Shopping centres specialising in discounted
fashions and some retailers of electronics had benefited fromstronger demand in the weeks after the Olympic Games.There were also suggestions that sales of some higher-ticketitems, such as furniture, had begun to revive as householdsreplaced their existing durables.  Demand for new cars,particularly the most fuel-efficient, was reported to have beenstronger this autumn than last.  But consumers were stillthought to be controlling discretionary spending very carefully.Retailers remained guarded about the resilience of spendinggrowth, given a continuing need for strong price incentives,and many planned to control stock levels very tightly in thecoming weeks.  Growth in demand for consumer servicescontinued at a gradual pace.  Some leisure and travel serviceshad picked up after spending had been deferred from the mainsummer holiday period.  Among savers, requests for financialadvice were reported to be growing.  But tight discretionaryspending was affecting demand for some other services,including private and higher education.
Housing market
The seasonal pickup in housing market activity appeared notto have been sustained and the number of transactions,particularly in the secondary market, had been less thanexpected.  Demand for new homes, supported by incentivesand part-exchange schemes, remained broadly stable, andthere were pockets of relatively strong sales.  Credit availabilitycontinued to restrain first time buyers;  new lending, at lowerinterest rates or higher loan to value ratios, had not yet had amaterial impact on the market.  In addition, stamp dutythresholds and uncertainty about the economy were said to berestraining existing home owners from trading up.  Privateinvestment for buy-to-let was steady.Business investment
Prospects for growth in business investment remained verymodest.  Those manufacturers needing immediate extracapacity, or pursuing efficiency gains, were prepared to investstrongly.  But, for others, uncertain domestic prospects weresuppressing planned investment into UK capacity;  for some,the need for off-shore investment, to facilitate entry intoemerging markets, was stronger.  Within the service sector,competition and the popularity of ‘click and collect’ retailingwere expected to support further store format changes.However, new store openings had slowed and a number ofretail estates were now consolidating.  Business services firms’investment in new management systems was continuing butthere was little immediate need for additional physicalcapacity.  Some firms, particularly small and medium-sizedenterprises (SMEs), reported holding higher cash balances thanusual, either to avoid debt finance or to protect workingcapital, and were therefore restricting capital spending.  Somewere also accumulating cash either for future investment plansor in anticipation of merger and acquisition opportunities.
Exports
Slowing sales growth ( Chart 2 ) had been reported from further
parts of the euro area and also from some emerging markets.Slower growth in certain Asian markets, for example, hadaffected sales of luxury consumer goods;  additionally, someorders for capital goods were slipping back.  But in general,growth prospects in Asia and the Americas remained strongerthan those in the euro area.  Faced with weakening prospectsat home, euro-area firms were reported to have become moreaggressive competitors in emerging markets.  The level ofcompetition, as well as the weaker value of the euro, hadbegun to weigh on some exporters’ margins;  nevertheless, thenumber of firms seeking either to establish or to expandinternational sales had continued to grow steadily.  Therewere, however, reports of rising food imports in substitutionfor disappointing UK yields.2

Output
Business services
Reflecting intense competition and intermittent demand for
some services, annual growth in business services’ turnoverremained muted.  Professional services firms reportedglimmers of a recovery in transactional business andopportunities in compliance advice, litigation and disputeresolution.  Energy-related consultancy had strengthenedfurther and the turnover of some logistics firms had risen, inpart reflecting the gradual improvement in retail sales.Elsewhere, growth prospects remained mixed;  although, forsome, activity levels that had dipped during the OlympicGames had now recovered.  Growth showed signs of becomingmore focused on larger businesses, which were building marketshare and broadening their offering.
Manufacturing
Output for export ( Chart 2 ) had continued to grow more
steadily than for the domestic market, but slowing exportgrowth had begun to affect production plans.  Some firmsreported that finished stock levels were already being trimmed;others, that they might maintain output at its current levelonly for a short period.  Additionally, there were suggestionsthat a reduction in working capital and output would affectthe supply of certain materials.  There had been little changeto the relative buoyancy of sectors such as aerospace or oil andgas extraction, or to the cautious order pattern seen from thepublic sector and the construction industry.  Output fromsome other sectors, such as transportation, was slowing,however, reflecting weakening demand growth at home andoverseas.  The pickup in domestic retail sales growth, on theother hand, was supporting growth in output from a number offood processors, and from some clothing and furnituremanufacturers.  In part, this also reflected slow repatriation ofsome production to the United Kingdom.
Construction
Output was widely expected to continue to fall in the comingmonths, but there were suggestions that the fall in activity hadbegun to bottom out.  Early-stage work on both residentialand infrastructure schemes had picked up since the summer.  Anumber of contacts anticipated that new home completionswould rise over the next twelve months.  Repair, maintenanceand refurbishment work were strengthening, driven bycompetitive and regulatory pressures, a desire for improvedenergy efficiency and restricted public finance for new-build,though some educational institutions were adding morestudent accommodation.  Demand for new industrial spaceremained moderate.
Credit conditions
Recent reductions in financial institutions’ marginal fundingcosts appeared to be working through more quickly in theresidential mortgage market than in corporate lending.
Mortgage lending rates had begun to ease and the supply ofmortgages at higher loan to value ratios was improving.Nonetheless, the number of deals on these new termsremained small.  Some mortgage lenders expected lendingconditions to improve well into 2013. 
Some business lenders appeared still to be tightening terms.
This was a particular problem for some SMEs, where theavailability of overdrafts was said to be continuing to reduce,with banks preferring asset-backed lending and seekingadditional personal guarantees.  A number of firms had alsoseen a further deterioration in debtor days.  Recently, somelenders had begun to make offers at lower interest rates, butfirms’ awareness of such improvements remained low andsome smaller firms were reported to be very reluctant toborrow.  Among medium-sized businesses there was growingevidence of a drift to non-bank lending, with a number ofcontacts, including property developers, seeking longer-termfinance than banks had recently been willing to offer.  Bondissuance was being considered by some, institutional finance(both domestic and foreign) was being explored and the use ofprivate equity was growing.  A significant degree offorbearance by corporate lenders had continued.
Employment
Employment intentions were broadly unchanged ( Chart 3 ),
with little net job creation in prospect over the comingsix months. A further reduction in consumer servicesemployment seemed possible, because of the contraction ofsome retailers’ trading estates and shortening working hours,but several retailers were considering hiring more temporarystaff this Christmas than last.  Elsewhere, the outlook foremployment was broadly balanced.  Reasons cited bycontacts for recruitment included:  rising workloads;compliance requirements;  a need to bolster customer service;and a need to fight harder for new contracts.  But inconstruction and some business and public services,employers continued to allow headcount to drift down bynot replacing leavers.  Recruitment of trainees was increasing,to combat both current and prospective skills shortages.Recruitment difficulties remained unchanged and a reluctanceto relocate or to change employers restricted the supply ofsome skills.  A number of firms continued to hoard skilledlabour in anticipation of future growth. 
Capacity utilisation
Capacity utilisation remained a little below normal with onlyisolated reports of constraints.  Some manufacturers had yetto fully deploy new productive capacity and a number reportedthat pressure on output had reduced a little.  Consolidationand gradual growth were offsetting some of the slack in thebusiness and professional services sectors, but there remained
significant under utilisation of capital assets such as secondaryoffice space.  The level of retail voids in some towns andshopping centres was growing.  Some contacts judged that anupturn in output would in the first instance be absorbed byproductivity growth and have only a modest impact onphysical capacity utilisation.
Costs and prices
Labour costs
Labour cost inflation had remained low ( Chart 4 ) reflecting
subdued output growth and pressure on firms’ cash flow.  Thenumber of contacts linking pay growth to company profits orto personal performance continued to rise.  Reports of payfreezes had slowly increased, typically in the service sector,more commonly in smaller firms.  A few engineeringemployers had reported above-trend regular pay growth butrecently a number of other manufacturers had reducedovertime working and bonus payments.  Prospects for non-payemployment costs were uncertain.  There were continuingconcerns about defined benefit pension scheme liabilities andsome firms faced increasing pension costs.  Employersgenerally found it difficult to estimate how many employeeswould remain within auto-enrol pension schemes.
Non-labour costs
Cost inflation continued at a low rate, reflecting slowingactivity in both Asia and the EU and the continuing highervalue of sterling.  Some suppliers were said to be offering priceincentives to their UK customers because of weakeningdemand in their other markets.  Firms had continued to reportrecent falls in the costs of metals, timber and some softcommodities such as cotton and wool.  The cost of someclothing had also eased, though existing forward orders wouldmean that it would take time for lower prices to work through.Increases in many food commodity prices had also yet to makesignificant progress along the supply chain, though they werewidely expected to do so in the coming months.  Tightening
supply of some commodities and services was supportingprice growth in certain areas.  The cost of some oil andenergy-intensive services, such as shipping, haulage and airtravel had risen.  As forward price agreements ended, manyfirms were experiencing a step up in the unit cost of energy,but recent investments in energy efficiency were expected tomitigate the effect.
Output prices
Output prices continued to rise slowly.  Oil and grainprocessors had begun to pass through increased costs.Packaging prices had risen.  But food processors had generallyyet to secure higher prices.  In export markets, slowingdemand and the continuing lower value of the euro had led togreater price resistance from customers and the falls in theprices of some commodities were thought likely to add to this.In the service sector, fuel escalator clauses had allowed somehauliers’ prices to rise.  Banks had been increasing their chargesmaterially to some borrowers, but elsewhere in the marketthere was continuing downward pressure on fees and chargesfor professional, financial and many other business services.
Consumer prices
Goods price inflation was broadly flat at a moderate rate.Contacts continued to expect certain food prices to rise duringthe remainder of the year, notably for those with a shortproduction cycle or high grain content.  Reflecting tighterstock control, promotions for some goods had reportedly beenreduced or delayed, but in some sectors straightforward pricediscounting was becoming more productive than multibuys.Elsewhere, the greater availability of nearly-new cars wasexpected to depress values for genuinely used vehicles.  Pricesfor certain consumer services had edged up very slightly in thepast month.  This reflected some reports of greater demand,rising prices for some food services and higher transport prices— capturing both air fare inflation and falling subsidies fordomestic travel.  In many regions a strong residential rentalmarket continued to support growth in rents.4
