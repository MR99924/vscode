December 2013Demand
Consumption
Annual growth in the value of retail sales and consumer
services had remained steady.  However, the pace ofmonth-on-month growth had eased back recently as the boostto sales from good summer weather had faded.  Contactsreported continuing growth in sales of a variety of householddurables as housing market activity — and confidence moregenerally — had increased.  But there were some reports fromretailers of softening consumer demand, sometimes attributedto consumers ‘reining in’ ahead of Christmas.  New car salesgrowth was reported to have remained robust, albeit somecontacts had reported a recent easing in its pace.  Consumerservices turnover growth had remained unchanged.  A gradualincrease in appetite for leisure spending was reported,reflected by steady growth in hotel, restaurant and traveldemand.  However, consumers’ disposable incomes hadremained tight.
Housing market
Housing market activity had continued to strengthen, thoughremained below pre-crisis levels.  Demand for house purchasewas being buoyed by improved mortgage availability andpricing, rising household confidence and the Help to Buyscheme.  Buy-to-let demand was also reported to haveremained firm, with some isolated reports of overseas investorinterest spreading beyond London.  Estate agency andconveyancing activity was picking up alongside transactions.But some estate agents reported falling levels of stocks ofhomes for sale, as sales outpaced new instructions.  That wasleading to some upward pressure on house prices overall,though house price inflation outside London was generallyreported to remain modest.
Business investment
Investment intentions pointed to modest growth in capitalspending over the next twelve months ( Chart 1 ).  But although
economic uncertainty had fallen and credit availability hadgradually improved, many firms remained cautious aboutprospects and some continued to delay expenditure.Manufacturing investment intentions had edged up, withincreasing reports of plans to expand capacity in areas such asautomotive and aerospace supply chains, alongside acontinuing focus on efficiency and automation across manyfirms.  In services, investment continued to be dominated byIT spending, as systems were renewed or the interface withcustomers improved.  Investment in large commercial vehicleshad also remained strong, partly reflecting tighter emissionsregulations to come.  Some consumer-facing businesses wereincreasing investment to refurbish premises, or to improveenergy efficiency.  More generally, there were reports ofinvestment to consolidate businesses, alongside gentlyincreasing mergers and acquisitions activity.Exports
Growth in manufacturing exports had continued at a steadyrate.  There were reports of continuing growth inmanufacturing exports to the United States.  Exports to theMiddle East and emerging markets had also continued to grow,though reports on demand from China were mixed.  Somecontacts had said that Northern European markets werestrengthening, and those in the euro area overall were broadlystable.  Export growth was often reported to be strongest inaerospace, automotive and energy supply chains.  In contrast,exports of mining equipment were said to have weakenedalongside a retrenchment of activity in the sector globally.Services exports had continued to grow, including demand forconsultancy services related to construction and energyprojects in the Middle East, and numbers of foreign tourists inthe United Kingdom had risen.
Output
Business services
Growth in business services turnover had risen further(Chart 2 ).  Demand for a range of professional advisory
services had risen, including those related to mergers andacquisitions, corporate finance and business strategy, as wellas more specific issues such as auto-enrolment pensions.Commercial property related activity had picked up alongsidea rise in investment and signs of a recovery in occupierdemand.  Recruitment agency activity was picking up.Construction and planning-related services had seenaccelerating turnover as house building had strengthened.Some areas of financial services also reported growth,including non-bank asset finance and asset management.However, demand had remained weak for many smaller legalfirms, with gradual consolidation continuing in the sector.Growth in other business services had been broadly stable andwidespread across subsectors.  Areas experiencing risingturnover included haulage and distribution, linked in part tothe pickup in construction activity.  IT services growth hadremained strong.  Business travel had picked up and2

edged higher, albeit from a low level.
Manufacturing
Output growth for the domestic market had edged higher, butremained below rates seen during 2011 ( Chart 2 ).  Aerospace,
automotive and energy-related manufacturing continued toshow robust growth and, overall, domestic food manufacturingwas increasing as demand for UK-sourced product had risen.Growth in construction materials production had increasedfurther.  However, the production of basic household goodshad remained subdued, as had steel production.
Construction
Annual growth in output had increased further ( Chart 2 ),
largely reflecting rising house building, both private and social.The pace of recovery in house building had led to recruitmentdifficulties in the sector and to shortages of certain buildingmaterials (bricks, blocks), though the effect on output growthwas yet to be significant.  There were also reports of increasingconstruction of home extensions, and of rising interest in theconversion of old office space to residential use, following anearlier easing of planning regulations.  Outside of residentialactivity, construction output had generally remained subdued,though there were some early indications of recoveryspreading.  Office refurbishment activity had picked upsomewhat, alongside gradually increasing churn amongcorporate tenants.  And there were widespread — if still patchy— reports of rising activity in the pipeline of commercialdevelopment outside London for perhaps the first time sincethe financial crisis.  However, some contacts reported that anumber of major infrastructure projects had passed their peakin terms of activity, and public sector spending — in particularby local authorities — remained subdued.Credit conditions
Credit availability and pricing had continued to improve forcompanies, though remained tight for many small firms.  Therewere increasing reports of companies with strong balancesheets being approached by banks to change their lender,consistent with rising competition among banks.  But smallcompanies still often reported difficulties accessing affordablebank finance in a timely way.  That, alongside a desire toreduce dependence on banks in the longer term, wasencouraging the use of non-bank sources for new fundingneeds.  Bank credit availability for commercial propertyinvestment was reported to have eased, with private non-bankfunding increasingly available for development activity.  Therewere signs of gradually increasing credit demand ascompanies’ confidence and investment intentions edgedhigher, alongside low interest rates.  Sizable gross repaymentsof bank debt by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)had continued, largely reported to be in line with existing loanschedules rather than a deliberate acceleration of debtreduction.
Employment
Employment intentions pointed to modest employmentgrowth over the next six months ( Chart 3 ).  With growth in
the workforce lower than the rate of output growth,productivity had risen somewhat.  Employment growth hadbeen faster in professional services than in other services ormanufacturing, reflecting strong growth in turnover and risingcapacity utilisation. But professionals also reported thatwinning new work continued to require high levels of staffinput, given competitive conditions, and some firms werehiring staff in preparation for entering new markets.Manufacturers often reported aiming to increase productivitybefore taking on further staff, but overall expectations were formodest headcount increases.  In some cases, recruitment andtraining of apprentices or new graduates were taking placeahead of older employees retiring.  Rising house buildingactivity was leading to increasing employment in constructionAgents’ summary of business conditions December 2013 3

–Chart 3 Employment intentionsand related businesses.  In consumer services, increases in
headcount were largely confined to new store openings orwere associated with the development of on-line salesinfrastructures.  In many cases companies planned to increasethe hours of existing staff before increasing employeenumbers.  Overall, recruitment had remained slightly easierthan normal, but continued difficulties were reported in arange of skilled occupations, including IT and engineering,some mid-ranking professional roles, a number of housebuilding trades, as well as nursing and care home staff.
Capacity utilisation
Capacity utilisation was approaching normal levels inmanufacturing and services, as activity in the economyincreased ( Chart 4 ).  Within manufacturing, utilisation was
highest in automotive, aerospace and energy supply chains,but in some other parts of manufacturing there remainedconsiderable slack.  Less slack was reported by businessservices firms than in consumer services.  In the latter therewas evidence of utilisation increasing, for example hoteloccupancy rates.  In general, utilisation of physical capacitywas reported to be lower than that of labour, where some skillsshortages were apparent.  But there were few signs as yet ofcapacity constraints binding.  However, in the house buildingsector and its associated supply chains and services there wereconcerns that capacity constraints could begin to restrainoutput growth in the near term.  A box on page 5 summarisesthe results of a wider survey of contacts’ capacity utilisationand constraints on firms’ ability to respond to rising demand.
Costs and prices
Labour costs
The annual rate of growth in labour costs per employee hadremained moderate, with pay rises continuing to be clusteredaround 2%–3%.  However, labour market churn had increasedalongside rising confidence, and a range of contacts hadreported having to increase salaries in order to fill individual
vacancies, or retain key staff in areas where skills were in shortsupply.  There were fewer reports of pay freezes, and onbalance, contacts expected some gentle upward pressure onlabour costs per employee next year as company profitabilitygradually rose.  The effects of auto-enrolment on future labourcosts were increasingly mentioned as a concern by SMEs, withsome expecting to bear down on pay increases in response.
Non-labour costs
Inflation in materials costs had remained subdued.  Prices formost materials were reported to be stable or falling.  However,increases in overheads costs, such as energy prices andbusiness rates, had continued to cause concerns for manybusinesses, and the prices of a range of basic house buildingmaterials were rising.  Imported finished goods price inflationhad fallen, largely reflecting the effects of sterling’s recentappreciation and also a dampening effect from weaker growthin emerging markets.
Output prices and margins
Output price inflation had remained muted.  In manufacturingit was often reported to be subdued, though the significantprice rises seen for some construction products used in housebuilding were an exception.  Business services price inflationhad been unchanged, with contacts reporting considerablepressure against price increases from strong competition andtight procurement processes.  In both sectors, companies thatprovided high-value added products, or were introducing newoutputs, had greater scope to raise prices.  Profitability waswidely reported to have increased from a low base, however,often as increasing activity reduced average unit costs orcompanies felt more able to turn away lower-margin work.
Consumer prices
Consumer price inflation had edged down.  That had partlyreflected lower road fuel prices — which had also fed throughto some transport services pricing.  Food price inflation wasreported to have edged lower overall, alongside improvedharvests in 2013.  The energy price rises now scheduled wouldprovide some upward pressure on inflation to come, though itwas likely that inflation in some other administered andregulated prices linked to the retail prices index (RPI) wouldease in the early part of next year, as earlier falls in RPIinflation fed through with a lag.  More generally, littleinflationary pressure was reported, given thecost-consciousness of consumers and the tightness in theirdisposable incomes.4

–Chart 4 Capacity utilisationAgents’ survey on capacity utilisation
In October and November 2013 the Agents surveyed their
contacts to help assess how firms are responding to increaseddemand in the economy, and firms’ capacity to respond tofuture growth in demand.  Business contacts were asked howthey had reacted to increased demand (when relevant) in thepast twelve months, how they would react in the event of asharp increase in demand over the next six months, and aboutconstraints on their ability to respond to rising demand now orin the next six months.  A total of 525 firms participated in thesurvey, with a combined turnover of £86 billion and employinga total of 430,000 staff.  Results are weighted by employmentunless otherwise stated.
Among firms that had seen demand increase in the past
twelve months, a large majority indicated that they had madegreater use of existing resources, particularly of staff but alsoof plant and equipment ( Chart A ).  Smaller but still significant
proportions of firms had added staff or new plant andequipment.  This suggests that, while many firms hadresponded to higher demand over the past twelve months byincreasing their productivity, some may already have reachedor foreseen some constraints on their capacity.  Only aminority of firms had increased prices or had stretched outdelivery times in response to higher demand.
The Agents asked firms how they would respond to a scenario
where demand increased by 10% over the next six months, asa way of probing firms’ ability to cope with a large and rapiduplift in demand.  A large majority reported that they wouldincrease utilisation of capital and labour further — indicatingpotential scope for additional productivity gains in response tohigher demand ( Chart B ).  Compared to the backward-looking
results discussed above, in this scenario a larger number offirms reported that they would add labour, both by recruitingmore employees and by increasing working hours.  This couldreflect the large increase in demand over a short time periodposited in this question, but it might also suggest that somespare labour capacity has already been eroded.  Across sectors,
construction firms reported facing the greatest difficultiesresponding to 10% demand growth with existing resources:over 80% of firms would need to add extra staff and/orsubcontract more, and were more likely to increase outputprices than in other sectors.  Consumer services firms saw theleast scope to respond to increased demand by raising prices(14% would do so).
Constraints to responding to higher demand now or in the
coming six months were not particularly widespread ( Chart C ).
On an unweighted basis, a third of firms did not acknowledgeany constraints to growth, and 75% of firms saw no constraintsthat they class as severe.  By far the most commonly reportedbarrier to growth was the difficulty in recruiting new staff.  Thiswas most acute in construction, where intelligence suggeststhat some workers have left the industry, but was also reportedas a constraint in manufacturing and business services.  Aminority of firms highlighted difficulties obtaining new financeas a constraint, with the share greatest among small firms(17%).  However, even for small firms, that share wassubstantially below the proportion reporting recruitmentdifficulties (over 40% of small firms).
