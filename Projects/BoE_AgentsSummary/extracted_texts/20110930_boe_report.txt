The growth rate of nominal spending on consumer goods and services had weakened further.  
The housing market remained subdued, in part because many first-time buyers continued to struggle to
get on to the property ladder.
 Investment intentions suggested further modest growth in spending on capital, although there had been
a slight decline in the Agents’ scores. 
The growth rate of manufacturing output for export remained robust, but had slowed a little in recent
months.
Growth in manufacturing output for the domestic market had also slowed recently. 
There had been further modest growth in business services turnover, largely due to rising fees for some
specialist professions, and pass-through of past increases in fuel prices.
The level of activity in the construction sector was broadly in line with that a year earlier, as public sector
work had held up slightly better than expected.
Private sector employment intentions had weakened somewhat in recent months and now pointed to
only modest job creation over the coming year. 
 Capacity utilisation was around normal in manufacturing, with rather more in services, although there
was significant dispersion across subsectors.
Private sector total labour costs continued to grow at an annual rate of around 2%–3%. 
 Raw materials costs appeared to have levelled off, although for some contacts the cost of energy was
expected to pick up as contract renewals fell due.
Along with rising production costs, the higher cost of materials continued to feed through to the price of
imported finished goods , although there were tentative signs of a slowing in the pace of import price
inflation. 
 Output price inflation continued to reflect only partial pass-through of the higher costs of materials and
imports of finished goods. 
Annual inflation in the price of consumer goods and services remained elevated, largely due to the rise in
VAT, and the increases in the prices of energy and imported goods.

September 2011Demand
Consumption
Contacts in retail continued to report very difficult trading
conditions.  Spending on food and other essentials had shownsome resilience, but promotions were often necessary togenerate demand.  Sales of big ticket household items andnon-essentials continued to weaken.  And in various markets,mid-range products were being squeezed by value items andsales at discount stores, while demand for higher-end productsand luxury brands had performed reasonably well.  Spendingpatterns remained volatile, and had been disrupted by therecent public disturbances in some areas.  Real expendituregrowth was expected to remain sluggish over the rest of theyear, as increases in the prices of utilities and public transporteroded real incomes further.  
Nominal demand for consumer services had held up 
slightly better than that for goods.  Spending on certain non-discretionary services such as fuel, rent and publictransport, had increased, in large part due to higher prices,while demand for discretionary services had been falling.Within the discretionary element of spending, householdscontinued to search for value to maintain their broad patternof consumption.  That was evident in increased use ofpromotional restaurant offers and a focus on price over quality.It was also apparent in uptake of late deals on packageholidays for those going abroad, and the continued popularityof ‘staycationing’, which had supported domestic leisure andtourism.
Housing market
The housing market showed little sign of improvement.  Manyfirst-time buyers continued to find it difficult to raise sufficientfunds for a deposit, and the subsequent increase in demand forrental property had contributed to a rise in the cost of rentedaccommodation.  Higher rents had attracted more buy-to-letinvestors into the housing market, and they accounted for anincreasing share of demand.  London remained a bright spot,helped by foreign buyers, but the usual ripple effect tosurrounding areas had yet to materialise.  The market for newhousing was also generally better than the secondary market,partly because newly built properties were often family homes,tailored to meet the needs of existing homeowners, who hadsufficient equity to move house.  Some contacts alsosuggested that house builders were more flexible on price thanprivate vendors of existing property.  There were furtherreports of chains having broken down, as mortgage offers ‘inprinciple’ had been withdrawn.
Business investment
Contacts in both manufacturing and services continued toanticipate further modest growth in capital expenditure,although there had been a slight weakening in investmentintentions over the past few months ( Chart 1 ).  Investmentwas typically motivated by the need to replace existing kit,
develop new products, and find efficiencies to offset risinginput costs.  Much of firms’ investment was also gearedtowards labour saving equipment to boost productivity.  Somefirms planned to expand capacity, particularly goods exporters,although intentions had been dampened somewhat by theworsening outlook for the global economy.  In an environmentof sluggish domestic demand growth, some firms with cashreserves were expanding via acquisitions, and businessintegration was supporting investment in IT.  Supermarketsand discount stores continued to expand their nationalfootprints.  And there had been investment in transportinfrastructure and in the renewable energy sector.
Exports and imports
There had been some slowing in the pace of export growth,although the rate of expansion remained robust ( Chart 2 ).  The
most buoyant conditions were reported by exporters of capitalgoods and intermediates related to construction, therenewable and traditional energy sectors, automotive,aerospace and electronics.  Producers of consumer goods,especially food, also reported that exports were growing at asteady pace.  Foreign demand remained strongest in emergingmarkets and Germany, while exports to other parts of the euroarea had softened somewhat.  Exports to the United States2

were also reported to have weakened.  Few contacts now
mentioned disruption to trade arising from the earthquake andtsunami in Japan.  There were further reports from servicesector contacts that were now looking to foreign demand tosupport revenues.
Output
Business services
Professional and financial services continued to grow at amodest pace, although rising private sector activity had beenoffset to some degree by a fall in public sector work.  Anincrease in mergers and acquisitions in the wider economy hadsupported a range of functions in advisory, corporate finance,accountancy and law.  Some IT firms were also growingsteadily, reflecting the mix of investment across sectors.  Andadvertising companies reported that while overall activity wasweak, online marketing was picking up.  Recruitment agenciescontinued to see a steady flow of demand for temporaryemployees as many firms remained reluctant to take onpermanent staff.    
Among providers of other business services, there had been
some improvement in corporate hospitality and conferencing,although events were usually small, and also some pickupcorporate travel.  Haulage and logistics companies continuedto benefit from rising activity in the manufacturing sector, andshipping contacts had seen a rise in volumes of food andcapital goods exports.  Plant hire had also picked up, as firmsremained cautious about investing in equipment themselves.Firms associated with the domestic construction industrycontinued to report very difficult business conditions.
Manufacturing
The growth rate of manufacturing output for the domesticmarket had slowed over the past few months ( Chart 2 ).  The
pattern of output reflected the changing mix of expenditure inthe wider economy.  Manufacturers of investment goods,particularly for firms geared towards the export market,continued to report relatively robust growth.  Producers ofenergy saving equipment and suppliers of goods to therenewable energy sector were benefitting from the efforts offirms in the wider economy to reduce costs.  And the output offood producers was growing steadily.  But there had been anoticeable softening in activity among non-food consumergoods manufacturers.  And there had been a marked fall in thesupply of products to the public sector, particularly thoserelated to defence.  Producers of materials for the domesticconstruction industry also reported weak demand.
Construction
The level of activity in the construction sector was thought tobe broadly in line with a year earlier.  Construction had beensupported by some large projects in London and the south eastrelated to infrastructure, the Olympics, and some largecommercial developments.  Projects related to the energy
sector, both in nuclear and traditional energy, and inrenewables, were also supporting activity.  And public sectorwork had held up better than had been feared by somecontacts, although the impact of lower government spendinghad been quite different across regions, and the pipeline ofnew contracts had fallen significantly.  House building hadrisen a little compared with a year earlier, but contactsreported that the current planning process and new energyreduction targets would tend to slow the pace of growth.
Credit conditions
Credit conditions had continued to ease for large and medium-sized firms, especially those in the manufacturingsector, possibly reflecting improvements in the health ofcorporate balance sheets.  But increased nervousness aboutthe outlook had led some firms to scale back investment plans,and switch their focus back to paying off outstanding debts.Small businesses and start-ups still found it difficult to gainaccess to credit, and where loans were available, fees remainedelevated and the applications process was often drawn out.Concerns about the withdrawal of overdraft facilities at shortnotice had led some small firms to run permanent sizable cashbalances, inhibiting investment.  And contacts in sectors suchas retail, which faced weak demand conditions, also oftenstruggled to secure finance.
Employment
Overall, further modest job creation in the private sector wasexpected over the coming year, but the pace of employmentgrowth was likely to slow ( Chart 3 ).  In manufacturing,
employment intentions had fallen in recent months, asproductivity gains from investment were expected to berealised.  And some firms had scaled back their plans inresponse to weakening prospects for demand.  The pace ofgrowth in manufacturing had caused some structural skillshortages to reassert themselves, particularly for engineers.But it remained easy to recruit for low-skilled positions.

–Chart 3 Employment intentionsIn services, firms tended to have more spare capacity, and
there was less upward pressure on headcount.  But someprofessional and financial services firms continued to expectfurther modest job growth, and planned to employ moregraduates in the coming recruitment round.  There were alsoreports of rising recruitment and retention difficulties insectors exhibiting the greatest resilience, such as IT, leading toincreased churn in the labour market.  But job losses wereanticipated in the financial sector, and among services relatedto construction.  Taken as a whole, the consumer-facing sectordid not expect to employ more staff over the next year, despiteincreased hiring by some large national retailers.
Capacity utilisation
Manufacturing firms tended to report that they were operatingwith broadly normal levels of spare capacity.  But many werenow benefiting from past investment in additional capacity.And most manufacturers had scope to increase the use ofovertime to meet periods of peak demand.  There were,however, some reports of constraints on production due to alack of staff with particular skills.  And some changes inproduction patterns had effectively reduced the potential foreconomies of scale.  For instance, some manufacturers ofconsumer goods reported that customers often nowdemanded shorter production runs, to help manageinventories.  And competition among supermarkets had ledthem to demand more unique products and package sizes.  
There remained a significant degree of slack in much of the
service sector, with variation reflecting demand in the broadereconomy.  For example, in the provision of standardised legaland accountancy work, there tended to be considerable sparecapacity, whereas IT firms were often busy helping corporatesfind efficiencies.  Consolidation was under way in someindustries with excess capacity, and was supporting activityamong professional firms specialising in mergers andacquisitions, restructuring and change management.  Butdespite such consolidation, many business services contactscontinued to describe oversupply in their respective sectors,with numerous firms chasing the same contracts, and very lowlabour productivity.
Costs and prices
Labour costs
Labour costs continued to grow at a moderate pace, withsettlements generally between 2% to 3%.  In manufacturing,they were more likely to be towards the top of that range,reflecting rising labour productivity and profit growth.  Andthere were some awards targeted at those specialisms whereskills shortages were beginning to emerge.  In services, therelatively more modest pace of expansion meant that payincreases were typically towards the bottom of the range.  But,again, there was significant variation between sectors.  In IT,for instance, some firms had been able to give awards thatwere somewhat higher than the average, while in retail and
construction, pay freezes were still fairly common.  Acrosssectors, pressure from unions remained muted.  Andheightened economic uncertainty had led to a markedsoftening in wage demands, with consideration of job securityonce again trumping pay for most workers.
Non-labour costs
There had been a slight change in the tone of contacts’intelligence this month.  There were reports of foodcommodities and fuel prices having fallen back from recenthighs, and of a levelling off of the prices of a range of metals.While this moderation was expected to continue over the restof the year, contacts anticipated a significant rise in the priceof energy and utilities in the coming months, as contracts wererenewed.  The pace of inflation in the price of imports offinished goods remained elevated, although there had beensome tentative signs of slowing.  That was attributed to severalfactors:  softer world demand;  some switching away fromimports from countries, including China, where labour costswere rising quickly, towards other, lower cost locations;  andfalls in international shipping charges.
Output prices
Contacts were usually only able to pass on part of any increasein materials costs.  Manufacturers of niche and highlydifferentiated products tended to have the most success,which placed a premium on product innovation and thedevelopment of higher margin lines.  By contrast, producers forthe consumer sector faced the most resistance to price rises,as supermarkets continued to compete for ever more value-driven households.  To rebuild margins, some firmsreported that they had redesigned products to eliminate somemore costly inputs.  The price of business services was risingonly gradually.  Many transport and distribution companieshad been able to pass on rising fuel costs, and some specialisedservices had been able to raise their fees.  But competitivepressures continued to bear down on the prices ofstandardised professional and financial services.
Consumer prices
Contacts reported that annual retail goods inflation remainedelevated, pushed up by the increase in VAT, the rise in the priceof imports and higher food prices.  But higher list prices wereoften offset by extensive discounting.  Some contacts reportedthat consumers were now buying goods only on promotion, soloss-leaders were failing to generate sales elsewhere.  Otherssuggested that multi-buys were losing their ability to supportvolumes, and were moving towards greater use of straightprice reductions.  The price of consumer services alsocontinued to rise at a fairly rapid pace.  Inflation was mostmarked in non-discretionary services, including transport,insurance and energy.  By contrast, inflation in the price ofdiscretionary services tended still to be under downwardpressure, particularly in leisure and tourism.4
