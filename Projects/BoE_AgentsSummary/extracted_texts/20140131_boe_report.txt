January 2014Demand
Consumption
Annual growth in the value of retail sales had eased a little
(Chart 1 ).  Contacts had reported some ‘reining in’ of retail
spending ahead of the festive season, in part reflectingexpectations of discounting to come nearer to Christmas andthat the mid-week timing of Christmas Day had causedpurchases to be delayed until the few days before (a box onpage 5 summarises an Agents’ survey of consumer spendingover the Christmas period).  The volume of food sales wasreported to be broadly flat on a year earlier.  But spending on anumber of household durables was reported to be graduallystrengthening, partly linked to stronger housing marketactivity.  Annual growth in new car sales had remained robust,though some contacts reported an easing in the pace of thatgrowth in recent months.  Consumer services growth hadedged higher ( Chart 1 ).  A gradual increase in appetite for
leisure spending was reported, reflected by steady growth inhotel, restaurant and coffee shop activity, as well as risingdemand for visitor attractions and domestic travel.  Lookingacross the consumer-facing sector, expectations weregenerally for moderate growth in sales to continue overall,restrained by tight disposable incomes.  
Housing market
Housing market activity had continued to strengthen both fornewly built and existing homes.  Demand for house purchasewas being buoyed by rising household confidence, improvedmortgage availability, and the effects of the Government’sHelp to Buy scheme.  Activity had picked up most at the lowerend of the property scale, reflecting rising first-time buyer andbuy-to-let activity.  Estate agents reported falling levels ofstocks of homes for sale, albeit in some cases from previouslyelevated levels, as sales outpaced new instructions.  That wascontributing to some upwards pressure on selling prices,though house price inflation outside London was generallyreported to have remained modest.  Business investment
Investment intentions had edged higher in the service sectorand, for both manufacturing and services, had continued topoint to modest growth in capital spending over the nexttwelve months.  Investment was reported to be mostlysmall-scale and largely driven by:  a desire to increaseefficiency;  long-delayed replacement of equipment;  or, ina growing minority of cases, modest increases to capacity.There were some early signs of an increase in the number ofcompanies considering larger-scale investment plans, thoughthese were still tentative and unlikely to impact on spendingfor some time.  Corporate spending plans were often reportedto be focused on property or mergers and acquisition (M&A)activity, though that might be followed by rising capitalspending in due course.  
Exports
Moderate annual growth in the value of manufactured exportshad continued.  The pace of growth had eased very slightly,however, reflecting slowing demand growth in some emergingmarkets and a dampening effect from sterling’s recentappreciation among some companies, particularly producersof basic goods.  Among the major industrial economy markets,growth in exports to the United States was often reported tohave remained robust, while demand from the euro area hadstagnated overall, with some contacts expressing concernsabout weakening demand in France, albeit offset partially byimproving demand from Ireland.  Moderate goods exportsgrowth was generally expected over the coming year.  Amongservice companies, growth in exports on a year earlier werereported by engineering and consultancy firms operating inthe Middle East.
Output
Business services
Annual growth in business services turnover had edged higher(Chart 2 ).  Marketing, public relations and advertising
spending was reported to have picked up somewhat againsta backdrop of economic recovery.  Demand for a range ofprofessional advisory services had risen further, alongsideincreases in the number of corporate finance transactions,initial public offerings and mergers and acquisitions deals.Recruitment agency and training activity had also picked upfurther as churn in the labour market had risen.  IT servicesgrowth had remained strong.  Property-related activity hadpicked up further alongside growth in housing market activityand some recovery in commercial property investment.Among other business services, haulage and distribution wasreported to have been boosted by rising construction activity,and business travel and corporate hospitality had risenmodestly over the past year.  2

Manufacturing
Output growth for the domestic market had risen further
(Chart 2 ).  Areas showing robust growth included aerospace,
automotive and energy-related supply chains.  Constructionmaterials production was showing rapid growth, alongsiderising house-building activity and some pickup in generalconstruction.  However, defence output growth hadweakened, reflecting shrinkage in military spendinginternationally.  Steel production and printing output had alsoremained weak.  As a whole though, manufacturing contactswere positive about prospects for output growth in 2014.
Construction
Annual growth in output had increased further ( Chart 2 ).  That
had largely reflected accelerating private house building.  Thepace of recovery in that subsector had led to recruitmentdifficulties and shortages of certain building materials (bricks,blocks), though views were mixed about how quickly thosepotential constraints would ease.  There were also signs ofgrowth starting to pick up in commercial construction activity,with increasing construction of small-scale industrial unitsalongside increased demand for warehousing andmanufacturing space.  Growth in smaller-scale refurbishmentactivity had also picked up, both in the residential andcommercial sectors.  Office construction activity remainedrobust in London, though subdued outside the capital.  
Credit conditions
Credit availability had continued to improve gradually,including for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), withevidence of increasing competition to lend.  The number ofcontacts identifying access to finance as an impediment haddeclined, and increasing competition was leading to somereduction in the cost of corporate credit.  Credit was reportedto be readily available for large firms and in most cases formedium-sized firms.  But credit availability for smallcompanies remained tighter than it had been on averagebefore the recession, particularly where companies lackedtangible assets to provide as security or had previously
breached covenants.  Some larger companies were reported tobe raising funds from capital markets to provide finance forfuture M&A opportunities.  More generally, credit demand hadremained subdued, though there were signs of some gradualincrease, including in SMEs’ use of asset finance to replaceaging equipment. 
Employment 
Employment intentions had continued to point to modestemployment growth over the next six months ( Chart 3 ).
Recent growth in contacts’ workforces had often beenincremental, in response to increased activity or expectationsof further growth in activity to come, but those increases hadbeen broad-based across the economy.  Productivity was oftenreported to be rising, but typically by less than the growth indemand.  In some cases, contacts reported increasedproductivity of back-office staff as activity had risen, but thatmore front-line staff were being taken on to win business in ahighly competitive market.  Across sectors, employmentintentions were little changed on the previous month, thoughhad edged higher in consumer services.  Increased housingmarket activity was leading to rising employment in relatedareas, including estate agency and conveyancing.
Recruitment difficulties had edged higher and were now close
to normal levels.  For lower-skilled occupations, recruitmentconditions had remained easier than normal.  But there wereincreasing reports of problems in recruiting skilled labouracross a range of occupations.  Those reports had extendedrecently to include some senior sales staff, management andHGV drivers, in addition to IT, engineering and a wideningrange of trades and professions related to the housing market.Staff attrition was reported to be rising, albeit from a relativelylow base, with companies often seeking to replace departingstaff by recruiting and training more junior staff, such asapprentices.  In some cases, that had had adverse effects oncompany productivity in the short term.

–Chart 2 Manufacturing, business services and
construction outputCapacity utilisation
Output growth had continued to erode gradually spare
capacity.  Overall, capacity utilisation was close to normallevels in manufacturing and services, albeit with markeddivergences between different subsectors of the economy.Across manufacturing and service sectors, utilisation of labourwas reported to be greater than that of plant and equipment,and companies often reported that they would be likely torespond to rising demand by increased staffing ahead ofstrengthening investment, though they remained focused onraising the productivity of their existing resources.  In housebuilding, supply chain utilisation was rising rapidly, which insome cases was being reflected in lengthening lead times.Views on the extent to which constraints might bind on housebuilding growth in the short term were mixed, with somecontacts suggesting that potential bottlenecks could be easedby plans to sustain higher materials production through wintermonths and by a return of skilled workers to the sector asconstruction wages rose.  But others expected that theunderlying growth in activity would cause constraints toimpinge increasingly on construction output.
Costs and prices
Labour costs
The annual rate of growth in labour costs per employee hadedged higher, though remained moderate ( Chart 4 ).  That rise
had reflected a pickup in the number of reports of pay creepfor some skills where recruitment was difficult, as companiessought either to retain or attract key staff, though as yet thelabour costs of only a minority of contacts had beensignificantly affected.  More generally, fewer pay freezes werenow being reported across the economy.  Some contactsnoted that wages had become more closely tied toprofitability during the downturn, potentially strengtheningthe relationship between pay and productivity going forward.Among firms that had transitioned to auto-enrolmentpensions, employee opt-out rates were often reported to below, contributing to labour cost growth in excess of the rate ofwage inflation.  
Non-labour costs
Inflation in materials costs had remained subdued.  Upwardspressure on non-labour input costs had remained largelyconfined to energy prices, though in the construction sector,there were reports of some significant increases in a range ofbasic house building materials prices.  Imported finished goodsprice inflation had edged lower, largely reflecting the
downward effect from weaker growth in emerging marketsand in some cases, from sterling’s recent appreciation.
Output prices and margins
Output price inflation had remained muted.  Companiesreported strong resistance from buyers to price rises unlessthere had been a clear rise in the cost of the principalcomponent of their business.  In general, companies wereconcerned that a price rise may lead customers to lookelsewhere, given clients’ continued focus on their cost baseand highly competitive markets.  Profitability growth waslittle changed for manufacturing, but had edged higher forservices companies as stronger activity had reduced averagecosts and allowed some contacts to shift away from lowermargin work.  Some exporters reported that the recent rise in the value of sterling was putting downwards pressure ontheir margins. 
Consumer prices
Inflation in consumer prices had fallen back over recentmonths, particularly for retail goods.  That had primarilyreflected lower road fuel prices, and an easing of food priceinflation following improved harvests in 2013, though somecontacts also reported an intensification of competitionamong retailers.  Scheduled energy price rises would providesome upward pressure on inflation to come.  But there wereexpectations of downwards pressure on inflation in publictransport prices linked to retail prices index (RPI), as earlierfalls in RPI inflation fed through with a lag.  More generally,contacts reported that inflationary pressure was generallysubdued and that consumers remained highly sensitive toprice increases.4

–Three months on the same period a year earlierChart 4 Labour costs per employeeAgents’ survey of consumer spending over the
Christmas period
As in previous years, the Agents conducted a survey of
retailers, shopping centres and leisure service providers in lateDecember and early January to get a view of sales over theChristmas and New Year period.  Two hundred and thirteenbusinesses responded this year. 
Contacts were asked about trading relative to the same period
a year earlier.  Weighted by turnover, around 60% reportedgrowth in sales values ( Chart A ), with a little under 20%
seeing growth in excess of 5%.  By comparison, in the 2012/13survey 75% of respondents reported growth in sales valuesand around 15% recorded growth in excess of 5%.  For leisureservices respondents, some 95% of contacts when weightedby turnover reported stronger growth in sales than a yearearlier.  
A key theme from contacts’ reports was a further movement
towards online retailing this year.  In particular, those retailerscombining a strong online offer with a good physical presencebenefited from robust ‘click and collect’ sales growth, albeitsometimes at the expense of their sales in store.  
Within total spending, consumer electronics had sold well,
particularly tablets and gaming.  But clothing retailers notedthat the sale of winter clothing in December had been heldback by particularly mild weather compared with a year earlierand food retailers reported some difficulty in growingunderlying volumes this year.  Most contacts reportedstronger trading in the final week/weekend before Christmasand at the subsequent start of their main discounting period.For leisure services, a combination of volume growth and priceinflation had led to positive outcomes for most businessessurveyed, with hotels, coffee shops and restaurantsexperiencing good growth.   On balance, sales were below expectations.  Around 40% of
contacts reported sales below expectations, compared witharound 15% above ( Chart B ).  Again the picture was more
positive for leisure service providers, for whom trading wasstronger than expected.
Respondents were also asked about the timing and magnitude
of promotional activity.  Around 85% of contacts reported the timing of discounting as broadly similar to a year ago.  A balance opted to discount earlier in a bid to limit stockoverhang.  The level of discounting was, overall, a little deeperthan a year ago with more sophisticated non-pricepromotional techniques, such as loyalty schemes andvouchers, used extensively.  The majority of retailersmaintained a tight control on stock management.  
Finally contacts were asked about expected sales for the next
three months relative to a year earlier ( Chart C ).  Around 
two thirds of contacts, when weighted by turnover, expected arise in sales, though most were anticipating low, single-digitgrowth.  Leisure services providers were the most optimistic,with almost all expecting sales growth.  Nonetheless, manycontacts reported that pressure on disposable incomes fromhigher energy bills, public transport fare rises, and sluggishwage growth were acting as a drag on their expectations forsales.Agents’ summary of business conditions January 2014 5
