November 2015 Update 
Annual growth in consumer spending had edged higher, with 
the pace of turnover growth remaining stronger for consumer 
services companies than for retailers ( Chart 1).
Business services turnover growth had remained robust,
particularly in professional and financial services ( Chart 2).
Growth in other business services had continued at a more 
modest rate.
The slowdown in manufacturing output growth had 
continued ( Chart 3).  Subdued world demand and sterling’s 
appreciation over the past 18 months had led to slowing 
demand in export supply chains, and had increased 
competition in domestic markets from businesses abroad.
Construction output had continued to rise solidly on a year 
earlier, although there were some reports of an easing in the 
pace of expansion of housebuilding and infrastructure activity.
Investment intentions had weakened in manufacturing,
reflecting the more subdued demand outlook, but pointed to 
modest growth overall ( Chart 4).
Credit availability had remained good for most businesses,
with high levels of competition between lenders to provide 
finance to companies with strong balance sheets.
Non -bank finance had continued to flow into the commercial 
real estate market , and occupier demand had risen further.Housing activity had increased modestly, supported by strong 
competition among mortgage lenders.
Capacity utilisation had remained below normal for 
manufacturing but had increased further above normal in 
services, where constraints were said to be binding in some 
parts of professional and IT services.
Employment intentions had weakened markedly in 
manufacturing and had eased in consumer services ( Chart 5),
reflecting a combination of a slowing in demand growth, a 
greater focus on productivity gains and some concerns over 
the National Living Wage.  Recruitment difficulties had 
remained above normal and had broadened out across sectors.
Labour cost growth had remained moderate overall, although 
upward pressure was reported in sectors where recruitment 
difficulties were most acute, including professional services.
Materials costs and imported finished goods prices had 
remained lower than a year earlier.  Weak global demand had 
contributed to further price falls for materials such as steel.
Manufacturing output prices were lower than a year ago.
Business services price inflation had remained modest.
Consumer prices for goods had continued to fall on a year 
earlier, but the pace of decline had eased a little ( Chart 6).
Consumer services prices had continued to increase modestly.•Activity had continued to grow solidly on a year ago, but at a slower rate than earlier in the year.  That slowing 
had been most notable in manufacturing, where investment intentions had also weakened.  Growth in services 
had remained buoyant, supported in part by robust consumer confidence.
•Weaker overseas demand growth and the strength of sterling had continued to weigh down on exports, and had 
also increased competition in domestic markets from businesses abroad.  That was negatively affecting 
confidence among some businesses, particularly within manufacturing.
•Total labour cost growth had remained modest overall.  Pay pressures were reported to be building in some 
areas where recruitment difficulties were greatest, such as professional services and construction.  However,
hiring intentions had eased alongside slower demand growth and an increasing focus on raising productivity.2                                                                                                                                                             Agents’ summary of business conditions November 2015 Update
