The Agents’ sense was that, abstracting from the erratic factors that had distorted the pattern of sales
earlier this year, retail sales values growth had been steady during the first half of 2010.
Consumer services turnover had remained broadly flat in recent months.
Investment intentions had picked up, but remained consistent with a gradual recovery from a low level,
rather than a robust pickup in spending.
Exports had continued to recover.  There had been more widespread reports of businesses preparing to
export to new markets, where growth had been more robust than in the United Kingdom’s traditionaltrading partners.
Business services turnover had risen further, primarily reflecting recovering demand for professional
services.  Growth in volumes was likely to have been stronger than growth in turnover, given ongoing fallsin services output prices. 
Manufacturing output volumes had also continued to rise, reflecting both stronger foreign and domestic
demand.
Construction output had begun to stabilise, but contacts expected cuts in public sector spending to
prompt a renewed contraction over the next year.
The availability of bank credit continued to improve slightly, although conditions remained tight for most
businesses.
Private sector contacts expected employment to remain stable over the next six months.
Paygrowth remained muted, although the slight upward creep noted over the past couple of months had
continued. 
Materials costs remained elevated, reflecting both demand and supply-side factors.
Consumer price inflation remained little changed, with contacts continuing to report little pricing power.

June 2010Demand
Consumption
The Agents’ sense was that, abstracting from the numerous
erratic factors that had distorted the pattern of spendingearlier this year, retail sales values growth had been steadythrough the first half of 2010 ( Chart 1 ).  New car sales had
declined a little following the expiry of the scrappage scheme,but by less than many dealers had feared.  Several contactsbelieved that their own promotional deals had played animportant role in mitigating the fall in sales following the endof the government subsidy.  
Consumer services turnover had remained broadly flat in
recent months, but annual growth had continued to pick updue to weak year-earlier comparators.  Restaurant visits andhotel occupancy rates had both improved a little, although theboost to turnover had been in large part offset by discountsoffered to attract custom.  Although airline revenue had beenhit significantly by the volcanic ash cloud, train, bus and ferryoperators had benefited, such that the net effect on consumerspending was thought to be small.
Looking ahead, the World Cup was expected to boost sales of
some products (eg food and alcoholic drinks).  But contactsremained cautious about prospects for consumer spendingduring the remainder of 2010 — many continued to expressconcerns that future cuts in public spending would lead toweaker growth and lower employment.  
Housing market
Activity in the housing market appeared to have remainedbroadly stable.  House prices had also remained little changedin recent months.  Demand for housing, especially amongfirst-time buyers, continued to be suppressed by tight creditconditions, although the availability and cost of mortgagefinance had improved slightly in recent months.  The numberof properties coming to market had increased again, in part assome investors moved to sell their properties in advance of apossible increase in Capital Gains Tax.  Moreover, many
contacts expected supply to increase further following thesuspension of Home Information Packs in England and Wales,which would reduce the upfront costs homeowners incur whenmarketing their properties.
Business investment
Investment intentions had continued to recover, althoughthey remained consistent with a gradual recovery in capitalexpenditure, rather than a more robust rise.  Intentionscontinued to be depressed by uncertainty about futuredemand and by the existing margin of spare capacity.Moreover, businesses remained keen to retain theprecautionary holdings of cash that they had built up duringthe recession.  The restrictions on bank finance, however, hadplayed a secondary role in suppressing investment thus far —most investment is accounted for by large businesses, whohad been able to tap non-bank sources of finance over thepast year.
Where investment intentions had strengthened, spending
plans remained focused on reducing costs and improvingefficiency, or replacing assets whose lives had been extendedthrough the downturn (eg vehicle fleets).  The only notableexceptions were some major retailers, who planned to increasecapacity or refurbish existing premises.
Exports
Exports had continued to pick up, with many ascribing theimprovement to a recovery in world demand.  Although recentconcerns about the impact of fiscal consolidation plans in theeuro area had contributed to pessimism and uncertainty aboutfuture growth prospects, demand in the United Statesappeared to have stabilised and many Asian economiescontinued to record strong growth rates.  Moreover, theAgents had received an increasing number of reports frombusinesses looking to export to new, fast growing markets,although contacts stressed that this was a long and drawn outprocess.  The lower level of sterling had provided a lesser boostto trade volumes, as relatively few businesses had reducedtheir foreign currency export prices significantly over the pastyear.  That reflected, in part, a significant concurrent increasein businesses’ material and imported costs.  But it alsoreflected the desire among some exporters to boost or rebuildtheir profit margins.
Output
Business services
Signs of recovery in services activity had persisted in May.Turnover in the professional and financial services sector hadrisen further, despite further falls in business-to-businessservices prices.  That implied that volume growth had beenstronger than the Agents’ turnover scores suggest.  Demand2

for accountancy, advertising, recruitment and legal services
had picked up in recent months, and there were tentative signsof a rise in M&A activity.  Commercial property transactionshad risen as investors looked to capitalise on relatively lowprices and, in the case of overseas investors, the weakness ofsterling.
Other business services turnover also continued to recover,
albeit at a less rapid pace than demand in the professional andfinancial sector.  Turnover in the haulage and distributionsector had picked up, and there were some signs thatcorporate hotel bookings had also risen.  But demand forbusiness conferences remained subdued. 
Manufacturing
There had been a further pickup in the volume ofmanufacturing output, reflecting both stronger exportperformance and, to a lesser extent, a recovery in domesticdemand.  Both scores, which summarise the Agents’ sense ofgrowth over the past three months relative to a year earlier,were now well above their post-1998 averages ( Chart 2 ).
Although some of the rise in the scores had reflected weakyear-earlier comparators, the Agents reported that finaldemand had also increased in recent months.  For example,contacts noted that production in the automotive sector hadbeen particularly strong over the past month or so, primarilyreflecting a combination of stronger export demand and agrowing propensity to source components domestically, ratherthan from abroad.
Looking ahead, the majority of manufacturing contacts had
become more optimistic about growth prospects.  But thereremained pockets of the sector that were less upbeat,particularly those manufacturers serving the defence andconstruction sectors, who were particularly concerned aboutprospective cuts in government spending.Construction
The volume of construction activity remained well below itslevel a year earlier.  But the pace of contraction had moderatedsomewhat in recent months, with a number of contactsreporting that output had begun to stabilise, or even pick up.The recent improvement largely reflected a gradualresumption of private home building, although the level ofactivity remained low, and development work continued to besuppressed by economic uncertainty and by restrictions on theavailability of finance.
The rise in residential construction had, however, been largely
offset by waning demand from the public sector, as someplanned projects were shelved and as the pipeline of new workcontinued to shrink.  Looking ahead, many contacts feared thatprivate sector demand would prove insufficient to offset thewithdrawal of public sector support, resulting in a widely heldbelief that construction output would fall again over the nextyear.
Credit conditions
On balance, the Agents continued to report a gradual easingof credit conditions.  The availability of bank lending hadpicked up a little, and spreads on new facilities had narroweda touch, reflecting increased competition from both domesticand foreign lenders.  But, as had been the case for manymonths, this gradual improvement was far from uniformacross contacts.  For example, conditions facing smallerbusinesses had, in general, remained significantly tighterthan those facing their larger counterparts.  Demand for bankcredit remained subdued, as businesses continued to repaydebt and, where possible, replace bank finance with non-bankdebt and equity funding.
Employment
The aggregate employment picture remained little changedin May — the Agents’ contacts suggested that the majority oflarge private sector redundancy programmes had beencompleted, but increases in demand had usually been met bythe restoration of hours and, where necessary, use oftemporary staff.  Looking ahead, private sector employmentwas expected to remain broadly stable over the next sixmonths ( Chart 3 ).  The exceptions were concentrated in the
services sector, where some major retailers expected toincrease recruitment to staff new stores, and in the financialservices industry, where there had been some selective hiring.In contrast to the expected stability in private sectoremployment, public sector headcount was expected to fallback.Chart 2 Manufacturing output

–Capacity utilisation
There remained a wide margin of spare capacity in the
economy, although incremental increases in demand had ledto a gradual increase in capacity utilisation in recent months(Chart 3 ).  Where businesses were recruiting, they had
generally experienced little difficulty in finding suitablecandidates.  That said, conditions in the labour market werereported to have tightened over the past six months, and somehighly skilled staff, such as engineers, remained in short supply.
Costs and prices
Labour costs
Overall, pay growth remained muted, with a significantminority of contacts continuing to freeze pay.  But the slightupward creep in pay growth noted over the past couple ofmonths had continued.  In general, those small increases inpay growth reflected businesses’ desires to reward improvedtrading performance, to boost morale among those whose payhad previously been frozen, and to aid staff retention inadvance of a further increase in demand.  Total labour costshad risen more rapidly than pay settlements due to therestoration of hours and, in a few isolated cases, overtime.
Non-labour costs
The price of materials such as metals, oil, plastics, paper andpackaging had risen significantly over the past six months,largely reflecting renewed increases in demand from emergingeconomies such as China.  But in some cases, supplyconstraints had also played a role.  For example, shipping costshad increased markedly since the start of 2010, as supplywhich had been mothballed during the recession had yet to bebrought back on stream.  Imported price inflation had been
waning, but remained positive in recent months.  In part, thatreflected the immediate impact of sterling’s most recent fallagainst the dollar on globally traded commodity prices.  But italso reflected ongoing pass through of sterling’s earlierdepreciation into a wider range of goods.
Output prices
Overall, businesses continued to report little pricing power,with many of the Agents’ contacts reporting that thesignificant margin of spare capacity had continued to exertdownward pressure on prices ( Chart 4 ).  Where price increases
had been achieved, they mainly reflected fuel surcharges andmaterials escalator clauses, which allowed businesses to passon cost increases directly to their customers.  Manufacturerswere generally more likely to have raised prices than theircounterparts in the services sector.
Despite having limited pricing power, contacts reported that
pre-tax profitability had continued to recover through 2010,largely reflecting the impact of one-off cost reductions madeduring 2009.  But contacts noted that the recent increases inmaterials costs would eat into future profitability, barringsome combination of further cost reductions or increases inoutput prices.
Consumer prices
Annual retail price inflation remained elevated, drivenprimarily by the restoration of the standard rate of VAT to17.5% and higher prices of imported consumer goods.  Retailpetrol prices had made an increasing contribution to inflationin recent months, following earlier increases in sterling oilprices.  And there had been some signs that retailers werediscounting more selectively, given the lower level of stock(relative to sales) that they were carrying. 4
