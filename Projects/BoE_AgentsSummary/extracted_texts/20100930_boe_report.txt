September 2010Demand
Consumption
The Agents reported further signs of softening in retail
spending, prompting a further reduction in the Agents’ scorefor retail sales values growth ( Chart 1 ).  Retailers reported that
consumer confidence had ebbed in recent months, whichmany ascribed to concerns about future employmentprospects, in part given the public sector spending plans in theBudget .  That had led to a decline in footfall and, together with
a continued focus on value and promotional activity, areduction in spending growth.  Spending on big-ticket itemssuch as furniture had been weak, and private new carregistrations had fallen markedly in the past month or two.  
Consumer services providers, by contrast, appeared to have
fared better than retailers in recent months, with many reportsof steady, if not slightly higher, spending.  The Agents’ score,which reflects annual turnover growth, ticked up further(Chart 1 ).  Hotel occupancy had risen, although lower prices
meant that businesses’ turnover had not improved as much.And although contacts in the domestic tourism sectorreported that turnover had been a little lower than a yearearlier, they acknowledged that 2009 had been an unusuallygood year for the industry, such that the year-on-yearcomparison belied the resilience of demand in recent quarters.Indeed, recent reports continued to suggest that UK residentshad substituted away from foreign holidays, given the lowerlevel of sterling and some lingering concerns about disruptionto air travel.
Housing market
There were mixed reports on housing market activity, withreports of increased sales and viewings broadly offset byreports of declines.  But looking ahead, most estate agentsexpected prices to fall over the remainder of the year.  Formany that reflected the combination of weak demand(reflecting restrictions on mortgage finance, consumeruncertainty and lower confidence) as well as an increase insupply of properties for sale (in part following the suspension
of Home Information Packs in England and Wales).  
Business investment
The Agents’ scores on investment intentions remained broadlystable over the past three months.  Many contacts planned toincrease capital expenditure over the next year, but increaseswould be gradual, and from a very low base.  Many spendingplans remained focused on improving efficiency and replacingassets whose lives had been extended during the downturn.But some export contacts reported plans to invest inadditional capacity and equipment, following strong increasesin demand over the past nine months or so.  
The main impediment to firmer investment plans remained
uncertainty about the economic outlook, and about how cutsin public sector spending will affect demand.  For some, thelimited availability of affordable bank credit was also weighingon investment intentions, although some businesses expectedto finance investment using cash reserves.  
Exports
Export growth continued to pick up in August.  Much of therecovery in exports during 2010 had reflected increases inworld demand, driven primarily by rapid growth in emergingmarket economies.  But prospects for the euro area appearedto have improved over the past month or so.  And whilereports in early 2010 had suggested that the lower level ofsterling had done little to boost export volumes, more recentreports suggested that a growing number of businesses hadactively sought new trade opportunities.  Some contacts hadalso won business due to their ability to deliver goods andservices quickly.  Contacts reported that the recentappreciation of sterling had not, as yet, affected trade flows. 
Output
Business services
The Agents reported that turnover in the professional andfinancial services sector had continued to rise, although thepace of growth remained modest ( Chart 2 ).  But with many
professional and financial fees and charges remaining belowtheir levels a year ago, four-quarter growth in volumes wouldhave been stronger than the Agents’ turnover scores suggest.Demand for IT services had been robust, reflecting in part thefocus of many businesses’ investment spending.  Demand forlitigation services had also picked up, as had demand forfinancial services, including corporate restructuring andmergers and acquisitions (albeit from a low base).
Turnover in the other business services sector continued to
recover ( Chart 2 ), although many contacts, including hoteliers
and event organisers, reported that a pickup in private sectordemand was being offset by a reduction in spending by public2

sector bodies, who had been cancelling events or trading down
to economise on costs.  
Manufacturing
The Agents reported that the manufacturing sector remainedthe most buoyant part of the economy.  Output had continuedto rise, mainly off the back of a strong recovery in exportdemand during 2010 H1.  But output for the domestic markethad also risen somewhat.  The pickup in output had been quitewidespread, with the automotive, food processing andpackaging, and chemicals sectors performing well.  Suppliers tothe construction sector, however, continued to report weakdemand for their products.  
Construction
Contacts generally acknowledged that the extreme weatherhad disrupted construction activity early in 2010, leading tosome volatility in the quarterly profile of construction growth.But the Agents’ contacts reported that the level of output hadrisen only a little in recent months, and remained well belowits level a year earlier ( Chart 3 ).  Contacts remained
pessimistic about the outlook for the sector, with many citingconcerns about the impact of cuts in public sector spending ondemand over the coming year or so.  Credit conditions
Overall, credit conditions had remained tight, but the lendingmarket had become increasingly polarised in recent months.Smaller businesses, and those operating in the constructionand property sectors, continued to report difficulty inaccessing affordable finance.  For these businesses, fees andspreads remained significantly higher than pre-crisis levels, andthere had been little improvement since the start of the year.By contrast, larger businesses and those perceived by banks asstronger propositions had seen a gradual improvement in boththe cost and the availability of bank funds through 2010.  Butthose businesses tended to have little appetite for increasedbank borrowing, focusing instead on paying down debts andaccumulating cash reserves.  
Employment
There had been further reports of modest rises in privatesector employment intentions in August ( Chart 4 ).  Although
most companies planned to make further use of temporarystaff, some had increased their plans for full-time recruitment,and others had resumed their graduate recruitment andapprenticeship programmes.  The strongest recruitmentintentions were concentrated among exporting manufacturers,but there had also been some reports of planned hiring in theretail and homebuilding sectors.  Overall, however, the modestrise in private sector recruitment intentions continued to beoffset by expected cuts in public sector headcount.
Capacity utilisation
Most contacts continued to report significant spare capacity(Chart 4 ).  But utilisation of capital and (particularly) labour
had risen gradually through 2010, and reports of some pinchpoints in certain sectors, noted last month, had persisted.  For43210123

And contacts in the automotive andelectronics sectors continued to report that they wereoperating at close to, or in some cases at, full capacity.  Forsome, that had reflected the pickup in output and exports,although others noted that reductions in overseas capacity,both in Europe and in Asia, had also led to a rise in orders fromUK sites.  
Costs and prices
Labour costs
The Agents reported that pay settlements, which had beenedging higher throughout 2010, had continued to rise.Although some businesses had continued to freeze pay, theAgents had frequently received reports of private sectorsettlements of 1%–3% over the past month or so.  Much of therise in pay awards had been attributed to businesses rewardingemployees’ forbearance following a couple of years of payfreezes.  But it also reflected improved trading performance,particularly in the manufacturing sector, where exporters hadbenefited from a more rapid rise in demand than theirdomestically orientated counterparts.  Looking ahead, somecontacts noted that prospects for pay and employment in thepublic sector were likely to help private sector contacts keeppay growth in check.  Elevated rates of consumer priceinflation had not, as yet, had a noticeable impact on paygrowth.  
Total labour costs had been rising faster than basic pay for a
number of months now, reflecting increasing contributions tobusinesses’ defined benefit pension schemes, as well asincreases in bonuses and commissions following theimprovement in activity during H1. 
Non-labour costs
The prices of a number of raw materials, including steel,timber, cotton and paper, had risen very significantly over thepast year.  Those prices had all continued to rise this month,although there were some signs that annual materials costinflation had peaked.  Oil and fuel prices had retreated fromtheir recent peaks, and reports of increases in shipping rateswere balanced by reports of declines.  Contacts also continuedto report reductions in commercial rents, which continued tobe suppressed by a significant overhang of empty commercial
premises.  The rise in wheat prices had not, as yet, led tosignificant increases in livestock feed or food prices.  Indeedsome contacts noted that any pass-through would be delayeddue to existing hedging contracts, although others expressedconcerns that increases in these food commodity prices mightfeed through to higher consumer prices later in the year.   
Imported finished goods price inflation had eased back,
although the Agents continued to hear reports of upwardpressure on prices from capacity constraints in emergingeconomies.  Some contacts continued to report upwardpressure on costs from the lower level of sterling, but othersreported that cost pressures had abated a little following themost recent exchange rate appreciation.
Output prices
Manufacturing output price inflation remained positive,although there had been tentative signs that it had begun toease back.  Professional services prices remained underpressure from spare capacity and intense competition — theAgents, on balance, judged that fees and charges remainedslightly below their levels a year earlier.  Construction outputprices remained weak, with frequent reports of businessesbidding for work at, or below, cost in an attempt to wincontracts.  Across the economy, there had been reports thatthe public sector had been pushing to renegotiate contracts, ina bid to reduce government expenditure.
Consumer prices
The Agents’ reports suggested that consumer price inflationhad stabilised in recent months.  Reports in August suggestedthat both new car prices and motor insurance premia hadpicked up.  But set against that, used car prices had resumedtheir downwards trend, and hotel rates had continued to fall.Food price inflation had also eased back, despite increases inprices of commodities such as wheat and coffee.  
Looking ahead, the Agents’ reports suggested that the majority
of retail and consumer services contacts intended to pass onthe 2011 VAT rise in full in early January.  But many businessesstressed the importance of key pricing points, with a numberreporting that they were likely to re-engineer their products (ie reduce the quantity/quality provided) rather than changetheir prices.  4
