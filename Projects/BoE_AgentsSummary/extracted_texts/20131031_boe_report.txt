October 2013Demand
Consumption
Underlying consumer confidence and spending had picked up
a little further on a year ago ( Chart 1 ).  Expenditure on
household durables such as furniture had risen, driven by apickup in demand for housing;  average spend in shoppingcentres had increased slightly.  New car sales continued toshow strong growth, assisted by manufacturer incentives.  Butthere were some reports of a slight softening of growth inretail sales values in the most recent weeks as the boost fromsummer weather to spontaneous purchases of items such asseasonal clothing and food had faded, and consumers hadreverted to more careful budgeting.  Consumer servicesturnover had received a greater fillip than retail sales fromhigher summer footfall to hotels, outdoor attractions andleisure facilities.  Discretionary spending on overseas holidaysand for luxury services, such as spas, had risen, but expenditureon lower value transactions had remained tight.  
Housing market
Demand for housing continued to gather pace, driven bygreater mortgage availability, confidence (both in economicrecovery and that house prices would not fall) and the Help toBuy scheme.  The pickup in demand looked set to attract astronger flow of instructions onto the secondary market.Prices of existing houses had risen more rapidly in London thanelsewhere in the United Kingdom, where price rises wereforecast to stay modest unless supply shortages arose.Vendors were more likely to achieve their asking price than ayear ago, but prices remained well below pre-crisis peaksoutside of South East England.  
Business investment
Investment intentions in both manufacturing and servicescontinued to point to modest growth in capital spending overthe next twelve months (see page 5).  Manufacturinginvestment had centred on efficiency gains (often linked toenergy costs), or was regulation-led, with little (major)capacity expansion unless related to exports or acquisitions.
But looking forward, there were indications that plans foradditional capacity and product development — in some casesput on hold since the crisis started — were being reconsidereddue to growing demand and confidence.  IT spending — oftento replace ageing equipment — accounted for much of thegradual increase in services investment intentions.  In businessservices, such investment was often aimed at raisingefficiency, while in consumer services spending was morefocused on enhancing customer experience and onlinecapability.  A slight uplift in retailers’ spending on premisesrefurbishment and/or rebranding was also reported, reflectingcompetition for business in a tough trading environment.Investment in ports and transport facilities had risen.
Exports
Growth in manufacturing exports had risen, including forsectors such as oil and gas, medical equipment, aerospace andautomotive.  Export growth was said to have been strongest tothe United States, Middle East, Asia, Australia and Russia.There had been continued signs that euro-area demand wasstabilising.  Sales growth to some developing economies hadstarted to moderate, partly as lower commodity prices hadslowed mining activity.  Services exports growth hadcontinued to improve, led by demand for engineeringconsultancy related to construction and energy projects in theMiddle East and Australia.  Overseas visitor numbers wereahead of a year earlier.  
Imports had continued to increase in consumer goods, due to
demand for products such as cars;  imports of constructionmaterials had also risen, reflecting pressures on UK productioncapacity.  
Output
Business services
Growth in business services turnover had strengthened,particularly for professional services, reflecting rising volumesrather than prices ( Chart 2 ).  Demand had risen for higher2

mergers and acquisitions and corporate finance.Strengthening demand in the economy was translating intohigher usage of IT providers, marketing (for example by housebuilders for new sites), and of residential property-relatedservices.  Recruitment agencies also reported higher demandas staff started to move employer again, and hauliers notedgreater workloads from higher online spend by consumers andstronger house building activity.  
Manufacturing
Output growth for the domestic market had picked upmoderately ( Chart 3 ).  Demand among house builders for
early stage construction materials and aggregates hadwidened to fit-out products such as windows and doors.Improved consumer demand for household goods had raisedoutput a little, and capital goods manufacturers reportedhigher orders.  Export growth in aerospace, automotive, foodand pharmaceutical products also continued to contributepositively to supply chains.  Food volumes growth remainedsubdued as consumers reduced wastage in the face of priceinflation.  
Construction
Annual growth in output had continued to strengthen (Chart 4 ).  Private house building activity had risen robustly 
on a year ago in response to demand, and social housing startswere also supporting growth.  Both trends were set to persist,though there was a risk that growth could be curtailed byemerging capacity constraints in both skills and materials.Development of new office, hotel and logistics space hadstarted to rise slightly as finance gradually became availableagain.  That reflected a paucity of vacant or new prime space,which was also helping to stimulate refurbishment ofattractive secondary sites.  Health, education andinfrastructure projects, as well as utilities’ capital programmes,remained a cornerstone of work for many contractors, giventhe lack of speculative property development activity.Credit conditions
Corporate credit demand and supply had edged higher.  Bankshad become more proactive in speaking to customers, but thecollateral requirements for bank lending were often astumbling block for smaller businesses.  Reliance on non-bankfunding continued to grow, either from internal resources,assisted by higher cash balances, or external providers,including pension funds and insurance companies on largertransactions.  Commercial property lending had started torecover modestly.  Working capital had become more strainedfor some smaller businesses as larger customers’ paymentterms had lengthened, notably in the construction and retailsectors.  In some cases the impact on suppliers’ cash flow wasmitigated by larger customers offering early payment in returnfor a discounted price.  Invoice discounting provided anothermethod to improve cash flow, but some businesses facing lowprofit margins reported that the costs of this form of financewere high.  
Employment 
Employment intentions had risen in business services butremained subdued overall ( Chart 5 ).  The wholesale and
distribution sector was expanding headcount, but oftenthrough temporary labour, and IT providers were taking onmore contractors.  Although professional services firms sawdemand strengthening, contacts remained reticent to raisestaffing overheads, and planned to focus recruitment on juniorstaff, or to exit less profitable work.  Many consumer servicesfirms reported that higher demand would first be met byincreasing hours of existing staff at peak times, though estateagents had increased staffing as housing activity had risen.Manufacturers expected to respond to rising demand throughincreases in productivity rather than staffing.  Apprenticenumbers were growing as employers responded to ageingworkforces whilst maintaining prudent control of labour costs.Recruitment difficulties had tightened beyond engineering andIT to include other skills:  construction trades, HGV drivers andAgents’ summary of business conditions October 2013 3

recent record lows.  However, recruitment difficultiesremained marginally below normal overall and were not anissue for the majority of unskilled roles.  
Capacity utilisation
Capacity utilisation had continued to recover towards normalin manufacturing.  Spare capacity remained more pronouncedin capital than labour, and many manufacturers felt confidentthat higher demand over the next six months could be met byadding temporary labour or shifts, and, to a lesser degree,plant.  Capacity constraints had already become an issue inconstruction, particularly for materials such as bricks, causingdelivery times to lengthen and imports to rise.  Suchconstraints might be temporary, particularly for materials;  thegrowth of skills shortages caused by employees having left theindustry and a lack of training since the onset of the crisisappeared likely to be more persistent, however.  Some slackremained in services sector companies, more so inconsumer-facing than in business-to-business providers.Professional services firms looked to manage greater demandby concentrating more on value added, higher margin work asfee rises remained difficult.  Consumer services firms’ usage oflabour had stayed tightly controlled, and staffing wasexpected to be stable in the near term, with employeesworking more intensively to meet any increase in demand.  
Costs and prices
Labour costs
The annual rate of growth in labour costs remained modest,but there were early signs of upward pressure for some roles.Pay rises continued to remain in the 2%–3% range inmanufacturing, and slightly lower in services, as consumerservices firms’ pay awards were often either tied to thenational minimum wage or had stayed low.  Professionalservices firms had sought to offset pay rises by changing themix of staff towards lower paid trainees.  Improvement in
companies’ performance overall was likely to translate moredirectly and quickly than in the past to remuneration as theproportion of staff on performance-related pay continued torise.  In addition, some above average pay rises and pay driftwere reported where there were skill shortages or rising staffturnover — for example, in construction, engineering and IT.  It remained difficult for firms to judge the implications ofauto-enrolment pensions for future pay as staging datesapproached.
Non-labour costs
Annual increases in the cost of raw materials had eased.  Costinflation had become less of an issue for contacts, with theexception of energy and, in particular, construction materials,where price inflation had picked up.  The cost of most metalproducts had fallen, and improved global harvests had loweredgrain prices.  Business overheads such as rent and insuranceremained broadly flat but business rates had continued to rise.Inflation in the cost of imported finished goods had edgedlower, in part reflecting some easing of world demand growth.Most contacts reported that the depreciation of sterling at thestart of the year was continuing to feed through positively toimported prices.  But the more recent rise in the value ofsterling was expected to put downwards pressure on importedgoods price inflation in the future, albeit with the usual lags.
Output prices and margins
Price increases in manufacturing and business services hadremained subdued.  Slowing cost inflation gave most suppliersless ground for raising prices, and most firms preferred to holdprices to avoid the risk of customers searching for alternativesuppliers.  It was considered easier to build profitabilitygradually through volume and productivity growth, or byexiting less profitable work, for ‘commodity’ goods productionand services such as haulage.  Margins had risen modestly, butremained weak, notably in services.  
Consumer prices
Consumer price inflation remained stable, but was expected to ease in food.  Administered and regulated prices such asenergy continued to be prime contributors to upward pricemovements.  Furniture and flooring prices had increasedslightly as sales improved.  Food price inflation had persistedfor some products but was expected to slow following strongglobal harvests.  However, red meat and dairy product priceswere expected to remain high.  Consumers’ willingness tosearch for the best deal was not expected to change, and the importance of price points continued to encouragere-engineering of products where costs had advanced — for example in food.  The warmer summer weather — andresulting better demand — had allowed some tourism and leisure operators such as hotels to raise prices, and there had been less discounting in clothing, reflecting lowerstock overhang.4

–Over the coming six monthsChart 5 Employment intentionsAgents’ survey on investment intentions
The Agents asked businesses about the change in their capital
expenditure over the past year and their intentions for thenext twelve months.  Firms were also asked about factors thatwere affecting investment plans over the next twelve monthsand about the proportion of planned investment that wasexpected to be funded from internal sources of finance.Four hundred and ninety six companies participated in thesurvey, with a combined turnover of almost £150 billion andemploying a total of 577,000 staff.  Results are weighted byemployment unless otherwise stated.
Overall, firms reported there had been a modest increase in
investment over the past twelve months and expectationswere for a similar increase in the coming twelve months (Chart A ).
The outlook for manufacturing, business services and utilities
and extraction companies’ investment had weakened relativeto the previous twelve months.  But this was counterbalancedby a pick up in consumer services firms’ investment plans andan end to the decline in construction contacts’ investmentseen over the prior twelve months.
In terms of the factors affecting investment spending
(Chart B ), the majority of respondents, weighted by
employment, reported that their investment plans for thecoming twelve months were boosted by a desire to add tocapacity, either for domestic or export markets.  A quest forfuture efficiency/productivity gains, as well as the essentialmaintenance or replacement of assets, were also expected toboost investment over the next twelve months.  In addition,
the availability of external and internal finance was expectedto provide positive support for investment for a small balanceof firms surveyed.  Pension fund contributions, companytargets for debt levels and uncertainty about the economicenvironment were reported to be pushing down on investmentplans over the next year.
The vast majority of respondents expected to fund over 75%
of their investment from internal finance, slightly abovepre-crisis norms ( Chart C ).  The shift towards the internal
funding of investment, relative to the pre-crisis period, wasmost marked for small firms (up to 50 employees).  Thatappeared consistent with tight credit conditions reported bysmaller firms, relative to larger firms with greater access tonon-bank finance, and with reports from smaller firms thatthey remained reluctant to rely on bank funding.
