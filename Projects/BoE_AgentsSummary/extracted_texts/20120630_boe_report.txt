June 2012Demand
Consumption
Consumer demand continued to grow at a gradual pace,
although the Agents’ scores for growth in retail goods andservices edged down on the month ( Chart 1 ).  After fine
weather had boosted demand early in the spring, poor weatherduring much of April and the middle of May had led to amaterial softening in activity, particularly for clothing storesand garden centres, and providers of outdoor leisure activities.More generally, spending patterns continued to be verychangeable and driven by promotions, and the sector wascharacterised by ongoing shifts in market share.  For instance,online sales were gaining ground at the expense of the highstreet, while discount stores and cheaper products werewinning custom from mid-range competitors.
Housing market
The fairly widespread improvement in activity since the startof the year appeared to have dissipated somewhat.  Somecontacts believed that activity had been deterred by worriesabout the economic outlook, perhaps related to developmentsin the euro area.  And a few, in particularly buoyant parts of thecountry, attributed the softening in the market to a dip indemand following the end of stamp duty relief for first-timebuyers, as some transactions had been brought forward aheadof the deadline.  Buy-to-let investors continued to supportdemand, however, and there were further reports of first-timebuyers returning to the market.  Contacts thought that forsome of those first-time buyers it had taken until now to savea deposit, while some others were getting help from family.But many remained constrained by tight credit conditions.There were signs of an emerging trend among the older agegroup to move to smaller properties.
Business investment
Contacts reported that investment was likely to grow at amodest pace over the coming twelve months.  Plans forspending were typically strongest among exporters, whichwere often still expanding capacity.  And some production
processes were being repatriated, due to concerns aboutquality and reliability of supply, and also because ‘made in theUnited Kingdom’ continued to carry a significant premium inmany growth markets.  Suppliers to the domestic markettended to be focused on finding efficiencies and replacingworn-out equipment.  But some contacts were seeking toextend the life of existing assets, even though new equipmentwould be more productive.  Plans for capital spending in theservice sector tended to point to slightly weaker growth thanin manufacturing, with firms generally focused on cutting costsand raising labour productivity through greater use of IT.
Exports
Goods exports continued to grow steadily, driven by risingdemand in a number of emerging market economies ( Chart 2 ).
For instance, exports of capital goods had been supported byinvestment in energy and infrastructure in the Middle East andextraction industries in Africa, while there was growingdemand for luxury consumer goods in China and Russia.Exports to the United States were also reported to be rising ata reasonable pace, but sales to Europe had weakenedmaterially.  That was particularly the case among the morevulnerable economies, although demand in some of thestronger countries had also softened.  Increasing numbers ofbusinesses were now looking abroad for the first time, andwere focusing on rapid growth markets to offset the weaknessof domestic demand.  Tempering that somewhat, there werewidespread concerns about the prospect of a furtherappreciation of sterling.
Output
Business services
Turnover in the business services sector had grown a littlecompared with a year earlier, but fortunes both across andwithin subsectors were very mixed, with sizable shifts inmarket share between firms.  For instance, some outsourcingcompanies were benefiting from the efforts of corporates to2

cut costs by hiving off back-office tasks, while others had been
squeezed as public sector bodies brought work in-house.  Andhauliers exposed to the export sector were often doing well,while those serving the domestic market faced morechallenging conditions.  The IT and energy sectors continued togrow rapidly.
Looking ahead to the Diamond Jubilee, most contacts found it
difficult to predict the overall impact of the additional bankholiday on activity.  A number of firms planned to close for theextra bank holiday and suggested that there might be amaterial effect on the level of output around that time.  Butfor many businesses the celebrations were expected to causerelatively little disruption to activity.
Manufacturing
The manufacturing sector continued to expand at a modestpace ( Chart 2 ).  The strongest activity was typically among
firms in export supply chains, particularly in car production,the aerospace industry and the energy sector.  But there hadbeen a slight slowing recently, as such firms felt the impact ofsoftening demand growth abroad.  Output for the domesticconstruction and household sectors was typically very weak,and suppliers to the public sector often reported thatconditions had become more difficult.  Some contactsexpected to have to adjust the timing of production toaccommodate the extra bank holiday for the Diamond Jubilee,but there was expected to be relatively little impact on outputoverall.
Construction
Construction output was reported to have continued todecline compared with a year earlier, as public sector contractsgradually came to an end.  Where there was new work for thepublic sector, the jobs tended to be smaller than those theyreplaced.  Outside of London, new starts on commercialbuildings remained extremely rare.  And supermarkets hadrowed back on their expansion plans.  But house building wasshowing some signs of improvement, and infrastructuredevelopment in transport, distribution and energy continuedto provide a source of growth.  The Jubilee was expected toresult in relatively little lost output.  But there was expected tobe some disruption to activity due to an embargo on workalong Olympic routes around the time of the Games.
Credit conditions
Credit conditions had tightened somewhat, with a number offirms reporting that rates and fees had risen.  And somebusinesses were being actively encouraged to pay offoutstanding loans.  But companies with strong balance sheetstended to be able to borrow at reasonable terms.  A number ofcontacts reported that competition between lenders for thebest credit risks had intensified.  But their own appetite toborrow often remained very low, with many firms still focusedon paying down existing debt.  Small companies continued to
prefer overdrafts to loans for the purposes of smoothingvariable cash flows, but often complained about the feescharged for undrawn facilities.  Some of them were now tryingto work with lenders to find ways of minimising such charges.Even though debtor days generally remained under control,some contacts had become more cautious about providingcredit to firms in their respective supply chains.
Employment
Private sector employment intentions suggested that jobnumbers would be broadly stable over the next six months(Chart 3 ).  In manufacturing, past employment and
investment meant that most firms were able to meet expectednear-term demand growth through higher labour productivity.Some exporters continued to recruit, however, and skillsshortages were prompting a growing number of businesses totake on apprentices.  In the service sector, businesses in IT anddistribution were hiring staff, along with some of the largerprofessional firms, but mergers among some small localpractices were expected to result in job losses as back-officefunctions were integrated.  Meanwhile, in the financial sector,contacts were often recruiting compliance personnel to ensureadherence to new regulations, while at the same time cuttingstaff numbers elsewhere.  In retail, contacts were often shiftingemployees to part-time contracts, or shorter hours, to allowthem to tailor staff numbers to demand.  But store closureswere expected to lower headcount in aggregate.
Capacity utilisation
The level of capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sectorwas broadly normal, although exporters were sometimes atfull capacity and a growing number of firms faced constraintsdue to difficulties obtaining staff with the right skills.  Incontrast, those supplying the domestic market often hadsignificant amounts of slack.  In the service sector, despiteBusiness services

–ScoresChart 3 Employment intentionsgradual consolidation through mergers and business exits,
there remained significant spare capacity in a number ofindustries.  In response, some firms had let staff go, but otherscontinued to hold on to labour to retain key skills in the eventof an upturn.  Continued oversupply meant that there werefrequent reports of ‘too many firms chasing the work’, with alarge proportion of staff effort now dedicated to tenders andgold-plating the delivery of services.  In one or two growthareas, such as IT and distribution, some businesses were nearto capacity.
Costs and prices
Labour costs
The Agents’ score for labour costs continued to point to a fairlyrestrained pace of growth, with settlements usually between2%–3%.  Awards tended to be higher in manufacturing thanservices, while pay freezes remained common in constructionand retail, with any increases typically motivated by rises inthe national minimum wage.  There had been some moregenerous awards to retain key skills in areas of short supply —among IT professionals and engineers, for instance.  Butgenerally there was little upward pressure on pay fromemployees and there were signs that increased uncertaintymight have held back settlements very recently.  Manyemployers had also moved away from across-the-boardsettlements, towards individual merit-based awards, or hadbroken links between pay and inflation in favour of measuresof profitability or labour productivity.
Non-labour costs
For many contacts, non-labour input costs continued tostabilise and the pace of inflation had slowed further(Chart 4 ).  A range of commodities prices had levelled off,
following significant increases over the past year, and somehad fallen back a little.  And a number of firms reported thatthey had successfully resisted suppliers’ efforts to raise listprices.  Importers of raw materials from the euro area had alsoseen a fall in sterling prices due to the appreciation of thepound.  But there continued to be stories of rising costs due topast increases in oil and energy prices, and these continued tofeed through the supply chain into the prices of oil-based andenergy-intensive products.  Inflation in the price of importedfinished goods was coming down a little more slowly than forraw materials, as foreign production costs, particularly inChina, continued to rise at a rapid pace ( Chart 4 ).  And
shipping and air freight rates had also picked up quite sharplycompared with a year earlier.
Output prices
Manufacturing output price inflation remained around itshistorical average, as past increases in costs continued to bepassed on, even if only partially.  To try to make it easier topass on higher costs to customers, a small but growingnumber of businesses were making use of escalator clauses
and contracts in which the final purchaser was responsible forbuying the raw materials needed for production.  And anumber of firms were seeking to secure higher margins bytargeting foreign markets, or differentiating their productsfrom others.  Where demand remained weak, however, theretended to be rather less upward pressure on output prices.
In business services, output price inflation remained subdued.
Some professional and financial service providers hadmanaged to raise fees by targeting higher margin nicheproducts, wealthy clients or international work.  But manyothers, particularly suppliers of standardised professional andancillary services, continued to report considerable downwardpressure on prices.  And many customers were seekingprogressively more basic services, in order to secure a lowerfee.  In transport and distribution, meanwhile, some contactshad been able to pass on higher fuel costs.  And in growthareas such as IT, fees had also been rising.
Consumer prices
Consumer price inflation continued to fall slowly, butremained elevated.  Goods price inflation had been supportedby last year’s increases in fuel prices and utilities bills, alongwith more recent rises in duties.  Discounting remainedwidespread, and supermarkets were increasingly making use ofvoucher schemes as well.  Premium lines were often used tocompensate for losses on cheaper products.
Consumer services prices were also still rising at a fairly steady
pace, in part due to inflation-linking of the prices of a range ofessential services such as transport and social rent.  Some localauthorities were also increasing charges for services to try toincrease revenues.  For providers of discretionary services,however, there was little scope for firms to raise prices, asdemand was often very weak, and promotional activity wasbecoming increasingly common.4
