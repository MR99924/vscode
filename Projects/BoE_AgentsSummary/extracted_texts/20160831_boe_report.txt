Agents’ summary of business conditions
August 2016 Update
Annual consumer spending  growth had eased further ( Chart 1 ), 
with unseasonal weather likely to have been a significant factor.  
Consumer caution had increased prior to and since the 
referendum, reducing demand growth for larger-value goods.
Business services  turnover growth had softened further 
(Chart 2 ), partly reflecting weakness in commercial property 
investment and other corporate transactions, such as mergers 
and acquisitions activity.
Manufacturing  output for the domestic market had continued  
to increase gently on a year ago ( Chart 3 ).  A decline in 
manufacturing export volumes had been arrested, aided by the 
depreciation of sterling.
Construction  output growth had eased, with many contacts 
expecting a further weakening to come.
Contacts, particularly in services, had been revising down 
investment intentions  in recent weeks, as uncertainty had 
picked up ( Chart 4 ).  Most businesses were not making 
immediate changes to capital spending plans, but a significant 
minority were reviewing their risk appetite and some were 
deferring decisions.
Credit availability  and associated terms and conditions had been 
broadly unchanged.
Activity in the commercial real estate  sector had been 
materially affected by the referendum result, with the investment 
market in London particularly weak.  Occupier demand had held 
up better.The outlook for housing market  activity had weakened, but it 
was hard for contacts to distinguish between the impact of the 
vote and other factors including the usual seasonal lull and recent 
lower demand from buy-to-let investors.
Capacity utilisation  had remained a little below normal in 
manufacturing.  Service sector capacity utilisation had eased on 
account of slower activity growth, but remained slightly above 
normal.
Employment intentions  in the business services sector had been 
scaled back, with contacts now expecting flat employment over 
the next six months ( Chart 5 ).  Some recruitment plans had been 
put on hold, reflecting lower expected demand growth.  
Recruitment difficulties  had been unchanged.
Growth in total labour costs  had edged higher in manufacturing, 
but was little changed overall, with the majority of pay awards 
remaining in a range of 1%–3%.
Materials  costs had stopped falling and overall were unchanged 
on a year ago ( Chart 6 ).  Imported finished goods  cost inflation 
had picked up, largely as a result of the depreciation of sterling, 
although it remained modest.
The annual rate of decline of manufacturing output prices   
had eased further and business services price inflation had 
remained modest.
Consumer price inflation  had been little changed.  Contacts 
expected goods price inflation to increase as a result of weaker 
sterling, albeit more quickly for some products than others.• This Update generally covers intelligence gathered from business contacts between late June 2016 and  
late July 2016.
• A survey of companies indicated the result of the EU referendum would have a negative effect, overall, on  
capital spending, hiring and turnover over the coming year (see box on page 2, previously published in the 
August Inflation Report ).  Consistent with those results, Agents’ scores for employment and investment 
intentions had weakened in absolute terms, pointing to  expectations of little change in staff numbers and 
capital spending over the coming six to twelve months.
• Business services growth had softened further, partly reflecting weakness in commercial property investment 
and corporate transactions.  Consumer spending growth had also slowed, although that appeared to have partly 
reflected the effects of unusually wet weather.  A decline in manufacturing export volumes had been arrested, 
aided by the depreciation of sterling.
This Update generally covers intelligence gathered from business contacts between late June 2016 and late July 2016.  It generally makes 
comparisons with activity and prices over the past three months on a year earlier.  The Update represents the aggregate view offered from 
business contacts across the whole of the United Kingdom.  More information on the Bank’s Agencies can be found at

Agents’ survey on the impact on businesses of 
the vote to leave the European Union
The Bank’s Agents surveyed a range of contacts with the aim of 
understanding how the vote to leave the European Union is 
expected to affect their businesses over the coming year.  The 
questions asked about expected effects on capital spending, 
corporate transactions (such as mergers and acquisitions 
activity), hiring activity, turnover and prices over the coming 
twelve months.  The survey covered around 270 businesses in 
the month or so following the referendum result, with a total 
UK employment of 1.2 million people.(1)
The survey results relate to the marginal effect of the vote on 
each business aspect:  whether the vote would have a positive 
or negative expected effect on turnover, for example, rather 
than whether it would lead to an absolute rise or fall in 
turnover over the coming year.
Overall, respondents expected a negative effect from the vote 
on turnover, capital spending and hiring activity over the next 
twelve months ( Table 1 ).  Output prices were expected to be 
boosted, on balance, as the rise in imported costs following the 
decline in sterling is passed through.  That upward price effect 
suggests the effect on activity in real terms is more negative 
than that shown for turnover.
Across sectors, the expected effects on turnover were most 
negative for business services and construction ( Chart A ).  
In contrast, for manufacturing there was a slight positive effect 
on balance, reflecting an expected boost to export demand 
from the fall in sterling.  But exports overall were expected to 
be broadly unaffected, as that positive effect was offset by an 
adverse impact on services exports associated with lower 
commercial real estate and mergers activity by overseas 
investors.
On corporate pricing, downward pressure on prices was 
expected for professional and financial services and construction, reflecting a weaker outlook for demand.  In 
contrast, for consumer services firms, any downward pressure 
from demand was expected to be more than offset by the 
pass-through of higher import prices.
Expected effects on capital spending and hiring activity were 
negative across all sectors, on balance, but particularly so for 
construction businesses ( Chart B ).
Consistent with the survey results, Agents’ scores for 
companies’ investment and employment intentions have 
weakened in absolute terms since the referendum result.  
Those scores point to broadly unchanged levels of staff 
numbers and capital spending over the next six and 
twelve months respectively.+

(1) The results shown are weighted by employment within the companies, and then 
re-weighted by sectoral employment shares in aggregate ONS data to be more 
representative of the economy as a whole. Table 1   Negative effects are expected on business activity over

(b) When calculating the net balance of responses, half weight is given to those responding slightly increase or
