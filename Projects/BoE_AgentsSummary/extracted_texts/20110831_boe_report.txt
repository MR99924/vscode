The growth rate of nominal spending on consumer goods and services remained weak.
Activity in the housing market continued to be subdued, and was thought to have fallen further in some
areas.
Firms planned further investment to find efficiencies and in some cases build capacity, but the growth
rate of capital spending was expected to level off.
The Agents’ score for growth in goods exports had fallen back somewhat from recent highs.
There had been a slowing in the pace of growth of manufacturing output , reflecting softening domestic
demand as well as the slight moderation in export growth. 
Turnover in business services was growing at a modest pace, as rising private sector activity offset
slowing public sector work. 
The gradual pace of growth in construction continued, but a marked fall in new public sector orders was
beginning to be felt. 
Contacts in manufacturing and business services were planning further modest increases in employment
over the next year, while consumer-facing businesses planned to keep headcount broadly flat. 
 Capacity utilisation was around normal in manufacturing.  Services firms typically reported some degree
of slack.
The annual rate of labour cost growth continued at around 2%–3% in both manufacturing and services.
Upward pressure appeared relatively more muted in the latter.
Inflation in raw materials costs remained high but was thought to have been slowing.  But many contacts
would not feel the full impact of higher energy prices until contracts were renewed later in the year.
Elevated inflation in the price of imported finished goods continued to be boosted by increases in
materials costs, wages in emerging markets, and transport costs. 
 Output price inflation remained high as rising materials and import costs were passed on, albeit only
partially.
Consumer goods and services price inflation remained high.

August 2011Demand
Consumption
The pattern of weak nominal retail sales growth continued.
Discounting was often required to drive sales, with anincreasing number of contacts reporting that promotions werenow used almost year round.  Unexpectedly weak demand hadgenerated an overhang of stocks, and in order to clearinventory, summer sales had begun earlier, and were expectedto be deeper than usual.  Spending on food and otheressentials remained the strongest part of consumption, whiledemand for discretionary items, especially durables, wasweaker.  The low level of activity in the housing market wasweighing on demand for furniture and electrical goods, withhouseholds only purchasing replacements as needed.  Changesin market share continued, with high streets losing ground todestination shopping centres, discount stores and the internet.And spending had become increasingly volatile and spikesaround pay days more marked.
The growth rate of turnover in consumer services also
remained weak.  Growth in spending on non-discretionaryservices was relatively steady, in large part due to increases inprices.  The cost of rental accommodation had gone up andthere had been a rise in the prices of telecommunications,insurance and transport.  The last of these had also benefitedfrom a rise in passenger numbers, reflecting households’efforts to reduce their use of private vehicles.  The increase inthe price of non-discretionary services had squeezed theamount of disposable income left for households to spend onnon-essentials, such as visits to pubs and restaurants.  Butdomestic tourism had benefitted from a switch away fromholidays abroad, along with an increase in foreign visitornumbers.  And hotels and leisure attractions reported someresilience in demand.
Housing market
The level of activity in the housing market remained subdued,and had softened further in some areas.  London continued tobe a notable exception, partly due to foreign demand.  Therewere a number of reports of an increase in caution amongprospective buyers, and of a rise in the number of mortgagesbeing withdrawn at a late stage in the transactions process.According to contacts, this had led to more frequent instancesof housing chains having broken down.  First-time buyerscontinued to find it difficult to secure funding.  But weakdemand from would-be owner-occupiers had supported rentsin the lettings market, which continued to attract buy-to-letinvestors.
Business investment
Investment intentions in the manufacturing sector continuedto point to steady growth in spending on new capital,particularly among exporters and those supplying them(Chart 1 ).  Firms’ investment plans primarily reflected ongoingefforts to find efficiencies and lower costs, as well as some
expansion of capacity in areas where demand was growingstrongly.  Rising energy costs had stimulated increasedinvestment in renewables and energy efficiency.  Butuncertainty was weighing heavily on the plans of producers ofsome consumer goods, especially durables.  The pace ofinvestment growth in the service sector was expected to beslower than in manufacturing ( Chart 1 ).  And there were signs
of a slight softening in intentions over the past few months,particularly among consumer-facing firms.  But many otherbusinesses were investing in IT to try to lower costs, or tocomply with regulatory requirements, particularly in thefinancial sector.  And there were continuing reports of theresumption of investment projects that had been deferredduring the recession.
Exports and imports
The Agents’ score for manufacturing export growth had fallenback from recent highs, but still pointed to a rapid pace ofexpansion ( Chart 2 ).  Demand continued to grow strongly in
emerging markets, and that was increasingly extending toluxury consumer goods, having previously been focusedprimarily on investment goods.  And exports to Germany andthe United States were also growing steadily.  But exports ofcars remained below normal as a result of a fall in the2

orders from countries most affected by tensions in sovereigndebt markets were weakening.  There had also been a smalldrag on activity arising from political tensions in theMiddle East, particularly for exporters of goods and services inthe construction and business consultancy sectors.  
Output
Business services
The picture of overall modest growth in professional andfinancial services persisted.  Public sector work had slowed, butprivate sector activity had more than offset this, driven in largepart by mergers and acquisitions, with a growing number ofdeals in the pipeline.  Firms seeking guidance on strategicpositioning or hoping to expand market share had also beensupporting advisory work.  Energy consultancy had picked upas firms sought advice on how to reduce their costs.  And ITcompanies continued to benefit from firms’ efforts to findefficiencies and to be compliant with rising regulatoryrequirements
There had been a gradual increase in the level of turnover in
other business services, in part due to the pass-through ofhigher fuel costs in transport and logistics.  And therecontinued to be spillovers for firms supplying services to themanufacturing sector.  But distribution companies reportedsome slowing in activity, mirrored by increased demand forwarehousing as retailers adjusted to unexpectedly high stocklevels.  Corporate travel, hospitality and conferencing had seensome growth in work for the private sector, but contracts withthe public sector were dwindling in number.
Manufacturing
Manufacturing activity continued to grow at a moderate pace,bolstered by production of intermediate and capital goods forthe export sector, but the Agents’ score indicated a slowing inrecent months ( Chart 2 ).  That reflected both weakening
output for the domestic market, as well as the slight slowing inthe pace of export growth.  But reports of disruptions to supplychains arising from the natural disaster in Japan werebecoming less frequent, suggesting that the peak impact onoutput had passed.  Some contacts exposed to the publicsector had seen a fall in procurement, with defence ordersparticularly affected, and signs of cuts and delays in projectsrelated to health and education. 
Construction
Construction output appeared to be rising gradually, supportedby some sizeable infrastructure and energy related projects,along with several large commercial developments in London,and activity related to the Olympics.  There had also beensome increase in residential construction, although there weresigns of a loss of momentum, reflecting softening conditions inthe housing market.  Large firms with agreements with thepublic sector had seen activity hold up slightly better thanexpected.  But there had been a marked fall in new orders from
the public sector, and that was beginning to be felt.  As bigcontracts became scarcer, smaller companies wereexperiencing increased competition from large firms for workon small-scale extension and maintenance projects.
Credit conditions
Large firms reported that they were able to access bank financeat reasonable terms.  And contacts had perceived anintensification of competition among banks for the business ofthe most creditworthy borrowers.  Credit conditions were alsoimproving for some medium-sized companies with strongbalance sheets, particularly if they were content to useasset-backed forms of finance.  But small companies, withweak cash flow or relatively little collateral, still foundborrowing terms prohibitive.  There had recently been somesigns of an easing in credit conditions due to the return ofventure capital funds and non-bank providers of asset-backedfinance.  But some contacts reported that trade credit hadbecome more difficult to obtain, particularly for suppliers tothe retail and construction sectors.
Employment
Private sector employment intentions pointed to furthermodest job creation over the coming year, although there hadbeen a dip in the Agents’ scores across sectors.  Intentionsremained strong in manufacturing, particularly amongexporters.  But the anticipated rate of employment growthappeared to have levelled off in recent months, asexpectations about the durability of the recovery, especially inthe domestic market, had been revised down a little.  Inbusiness services, intentions pointed to a continued gradualincrease in headcount, although at a pace that was well belowpre-recession levels, held back in part by expectations ofongoing weakness in public sector activity.  The Agents’ scorefor employment intentions in the consumer-facing sector hadbeen falling for several months, and suggested that therewould be little or no growth in jobs over the next year. 
Capacity utilisation
The degree of spare capacity remained around normal in themanufacturing sector.  Exporters, in particular, tended to reporthaving the least scope to accommodate further increases indemand, although some investment in additional capacity wasnow coming on stream.  Firms facing the domestic marketwere less likely to be working at full capacity.  And somecontacts reported that they would be able to meet extrademand by changing shift patterns, but were reluctant to do sowhile domestic demand conditions remained uncertain.  Andsome suppliers to the consumer sector had seen capacityutilisation fall in recent months, as demand had weakened.  Inthe service sector, there continued to be significant sparecapacity, although it was declining in some professional and
financial services hotspots.  Some contacts reported a fall inlabour productivity due to the increased effort required tosecure new business, as well as to comply with risingregulatory requirements.  And while these developments hadkept staff busy, in certain sectors there was often a sense of‘too many firms chasing the same work’, pointing togeneralised overcapacity in that particular line of business.
Costs and prices
Labour costs
The Agents’ scores suggested that total labour costs wouldcontinue to grow at a fairly moderate pace in bothmanufacturing and services ( Chart 3 ).  Settlements were
typically between 2% and 3%, with upward pressure fromovertime and changing shift patterns in manufacturingbeginning to abate as working arrangements normalised.Across sectors the link between settlements and retail pricescontinued to weaken.  And many firms were abandoningacross-the -board increases in favour of merit awards based onindividual performance.  Private sector unions were generallyreported as having taken a pragmatic approach to suchchanges.  Across sectors, contacts reported concerns about theAgency Working Regulations, due to become effective at thebeginning of October, which some firms felt would raise labourcosts and lower employment.
Non-labour costs
According to contacts, non-labour costs continued to rise at arapid pace, but upward pressures had begun to moderateacross a range of materials ( Chart 4 ).  And the rate of inflation
was expected to continue to fall back from recent peaks overthe second half of the year.  That said, a number of contactsstill anticipated sharp rises in energy bills as fixed-termcontracts came up for renewal.  The price of imports of finishedgoods continued to rise quickly, reflecting a number of factors:pass-through of higher commodity prices;  wage inflation inmany emerging markets, especially China;  and highertransport costs ( Chart 4 ).  Some contacts believed that theseforces would keep import price inflation elevated in the
near term.
Output prices
Manufacturing output prices continued to grow as firmssought to pass on higher costs.  But contacts were typicallyonly able to pass on some of the increase.  Greatestpass-through was generally achieved in export markets, withfirms dependent on the domestic consumer least able to passon higher costs.  Manufacturers of materials used in theconstruction sector were also largely unable to pass on costincreases.  Business services output prices had risen a littlecompared with a year earlier.  The use of escalator clauses hadenabled some transport and logistics firms to pass on higherfuel costs, although these were sometimes resisted.  Somespecialist professional and financial services companies hadachieved a rise in rates, but prices of standardised servicesremained under considerable downward pressure due to fiercecompetition.
Consumer prices
Annual retail goods price inflation remained elevated, on theback of the rise in VAT at the start of the year, and increases inthe cost of food and imported finished goods.  Further pricerises for clothing were expected during the autumn as newproduct lines came into the shops, but upward cost pressureswere expected to begin to abate in time for next spring.  Stockoverhang of clothing and big-ticket items had led most storesto start summer sales earlier than usual, with discounts deeperand across a wider range of goods than usual.  In food retail,there were also some signs of a move towards straight pricediscounting, rather than multi-buy promotions.
The pace of consumer services price inflation also remained
fairly robust, especially for essentials, such as car insurance,and for services with a high energy or commodity content.Inflation in the price of discretionary services, such as mealsout, leisure and tourism, had been much weaker, andpromotional activity was widespread.4

pricesAgents’ survey on corporate profit margins
The evolution of firms’ profit margins is a significant influence
on the path of inflation.  To try to ascertain the likely path ofprofit margins over the coming year, the Agents asked contactsabout:  the level of current profit margins — given by revenuesless costs as a percentage of revenues — compared with‘normal’;  the change in margins over the past year;  and theexpected change in margins over the coming year.  246 firmsresponded, with a combined turnover of over £51 billion.  Thecharts below are all weighted by turnover.
A significant majority of the sample reported that margins
were currently below normal levels ( Chart A ).  And margins
were below normal in all sectors.  But looking acrossindustries, the margins of exporters were a touch abovenormal.  The margins of small firms were further below normallevels than those of large firms.
Most firms also reported that margins had declined over the
previous year ( Chart B ).  Again, this picture was apparent in all
sectors.  But looking across the whole sample of companies,exporters’ margins were reported to have been relativelystable. 
Contacts were also asked how margins had been affected by
changes in product prices, variable labour costs, non-labourproduction costs, and other (or fixed) costs.  The major part ofthe squeeze in margins had come from increases in non-labourproduction costs, reflecting rising prices for a range ofcommodities, raw materials, and imported goods, along withother fixed costs ( Chart C ).  There had been some offset to
rising costs from higher prices charged to customers, but thathad been insufficient to prevent margins from falling overall.Over the next year, the same number of contacts expected
margins to increase as expected them to decrease.  But theweighted net balance pointed to a further modest decline(Chart B ).  That was the case in most sectors, although
manufacturers expected to be able to rebuild some of theirlost margin.  And the net balance was slightly positive forconsumer services companies, although the sample ofbusinesses in that particular sector was quite small.  Acrossindustries, exporters expected a slight rise in margins.
Over the next year, a larger net balance of firms’ expected to
be able raise prices, compared to the past year ( Chart C ).  And
respondents foresaw relatively little downward pressure onmargins from rising labour costs.  But increases in othervariable costs and fixed costs were expected to continue tosqueeze margins in the year ahead.Agents’ summary of business conditions August 2011 5
