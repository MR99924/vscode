August 2013Demand
Consumption
Moderate annual growth in the value of retail sales had
continued ( Chart 1 ).  Consumers were generally reported to
remain cautious about spending, reflecting tight disposableincomes, but there were signs of increasing consumerconfidence.  There were some tentative indications ofincreased housing market activity leading to rising sales ofsome larger household durable goods.  New car sales hadcontinued to rise, focused on fuel-efficient models andsupported by finance deals that allowed for low monthlypayment schedules.  And improved weather conditions hadboosted sales relative to a year earlier of some seasonal linesin food, drink and outdoor goods.  Growth in consumerservices turnover had edged up a little ( Chart 1 ), partly
reflecting a rise in demand for leisure activities and for traveland tourism, both domestic and foreign.
Housing market
Housing market activity had risen further in recent months,both in terms of enquiries and transactions.  In the new-buildmarket, improving conditions were partly ascribed to theeffects of the new Help to Buy scheme (applying to Englandonly) and to a continued easing of mortgage availability,though some contacts reported stringent conditions on higherloan to value loans.  The Help to Buy scheme was also said tobe boosting demand in the market for existing homes, byraising expectations of future house prices.  Buy-to-letinvestors had remained highly active.  On the supply side, ashortage of properties for sale was said by estate agents to berestraining transaction volumes and to be putting upwardspressure on house prices.  
Business investment
Investment intentions continued to point to only modestgrowth in capital spending.  Investment had remaineddominated by smaller-scale efficiency-enhancing or capitalreplacement expenditures, with very little large-scale capacity
expansion.  Some contacts reported ongoing concerns aboutdemand uncertainty and that a more sustained pickup inactivity would be required before significant capacity-raisingexpenditures became necessary.  Investment in oil and gasextraction had remained strong, however, which had beenreflected, in turn, in investment spending by manufacturerssupplying that sector.  Investment had also stayed relativelyrobust in automotive and aerospace production.  In theservices sectors, investment was often still concentrated onIT spending, though some retailers also reported increasingtheir capital spending budgets with the aim of refurbishingstores.
Exports
A gradual increase in growth in the volume of manufacturedexports had continued ( Chart 2 ), with weakness in euro-area
demand more than offset by growth in sales to theUnited States, the major emerging markets and increasinglythe Middle East.  Export growth was often reported to beconcentrated in products for the oil and gas industry, inpremium brands with a broad international reach and inhigh value-added niche products.  Growth in aerospace andautomotive exports had also remained robust.  Defenceexports had weakened in recent months, however, followingthe US sequester.  Services exports had continued to rise,including by IT companies, by some law firms delivering workin global markets, as well as by engineering and constructionconsultancy service providers to the Middle East in particular.There had been an increase in inbound tourism on a yearearlier, perhaps partly related to the effects of the Olympics onoverseas perceptions of the United Kingdom.  That, alongsiderising sales through internet platforms, was reported to haveled to growing retail exports.  2

Business services
Sentiment across a range of business services companies had
improved slightly in recent months, as moderate growth hadcontinued ( Chart 2 ).  There were reports of modestly rising
professional services activity around corporate transactions,often from sales of private small and medium-sized enterprisesto other corporate buyers rather than large-scale mergers andacquisitions.  Fund management activity had increased, withincreased inflows from institutional investors and sovereignwealth funds.  And some consultancy and advisory activityrelated to construction had increased as activity in parts ofthat sector had risen.  Growth in other business servicesturnover had edged higher, in part reflecting an increase intransport services, partly related to the growth of internetsales but also with a slight pickup in corporateaccommodation and travel, albeit from a low level.  Continuedgrowth in the turnover of IT and outsourced services providerswas reported, as companies had continued to seek efficiencyimprovements and cost reductions.
Manufacturing
Modest growth in manufacturing output for the domesticmarket had continued ( Chart 2 ).  Growth was reported to be
strongest in supply chains feeding into the energy industry orinto exports.  Aerospace and automotive production hadremained areas of strength, though parts of the supply chain tothe European motor industry had been affected by weakdemand.  There had been some further signs of strengtheningin the production of some construction materials andaggregates used in the early stages of house building, albeit inmany cases from a low base, but production for non-housingconstruction remained weak.  Many areas of production aimedat the domestic consumer had remained subdued, reflectingweak disposable incomes.  A gradual stream of productionrelocation to the United Kingdom from abroad and of importsubstitution had provided a slight positive contribution todomestic manufacturing growth, in part reflecting rising labourcosts in some overseas markets — notably China.  Thereremained, however, examples of production moving outsidethe United Kingdom as well.
Construction
Construction output had strengthened in recent months(Chart 3 ).  Private house building had increased, with
expectations of stronger growth to come.  In some cases,house builders reported that a shortage of sites was beginningto develop or that build rates were being constrained byplanning delays.  Some contacts reported a tentative increasein activity in commercial development within the leisure andaccommodation sectors and in pre-let industrial development,though the level of private development remained low andthere was little or no speculative development outside London.Significant utilities investment had continued.  Public sector
construction activity was reported to be concentrated insmaller-scale education and health projects and well belowpre-crisis levels.
Credit conditions
Credit availability had continued to improve gradually.Availability of finance remained polarised between very easyconditions for large companies, both for bank and capitalmarket finance, and tight conditions for smaller companiesholding few assets or operating in riskier sectors.  For smallercompanies, however, access to non-bank financing hadincreased further, and there were reports of greater activity bysome ‘challenger’ banks albeit often in ‘lower-risk’ lending,such as asset finance.  Demand for bank credit had remainedweak, in part reflecting continued deleveraging and a search bysome businesses for alternative means of finance in order toreduce their reliance on banks.  However, there were somereports of increasing demand to fund the purchase ofcommercial property or industrial buildings.  Within thecorporate sector, large companies’ invoice payment times hadrisen further, though bad debts were reported to be low.
Employment 
Employment in the economy was reported to be risingmodestly ( Chart 4 ), but at a slower rate than output as
companies sought to bear down on costs.  Companies oftenreported using their existing staff more flexibly to meetincreased demand, including some rebalancing of staff toproduction or sales roles from ‘back-office’ functions.  In themanufacturing and consumer services sectors, employmentintentions had edged higher in recent months as activity hadgently risen, though in both cases implied only marginalincreases on existing staff levels.  A gradual increase inemployment in business services was reported, in partreflecting the growth of IT services companies, increasedAgents’ summary of business conditions August 2013 3

–Chart 3 Construction outputoutsourcing activity more widely, and as those gaining market
share took on more employees while those losing shareremained reluctant to lose specialist staff.  Employment inhouse building was reported to be increasing more materially,however, particularly through the increased use ofsub-contracted labour.  Recruitment conditions had remainedeasy for unskilled labour, but continued to be tight for somespecialised occupations.  Those continued to be largelyconcentrated in IT and engineering, though there were a rangeof localised reports of skills shortages outside those sectors,including, most recently, in house building.  More generally,there were some reports of employees becoming more willingto move between employers as job insecurity had eased.
Capacity utilisation
Capacity utilisation remained slightly below normal in bothmanufacturing and services, but had edged higher as outputhad risen, particularly in the service sector.  The utilisation ofstaff was often said to be somewhat higher than of physicalcapacity, though in some sectors there had been continuedreports of considerable numbers of staff who could be movedback to ‘frontline’ roles from the back-office positions to whichthey had been transferred when demand was particularlyweak.  There were reports of concerns about capacityconstraints in house building — some for the future, othersalready being felt.  It was unclear, however, to what extent ashortage of skills in the industry could be met by migrantlabour or a return of skills and whether some productioncapacity had been mothballed, rather than lost, during theperiod when activity had been particularly weak.
Costs and prices
Labour costs
The annual rate of labour costs growth per employee had beenunchanged.  Pay awards in manufacturing firms had largelyremained in the 2%–3% range, though some awards forspecialist engineering skills were higher.  And wage growth had
strengthened for IT skills and in certain house building trades,reflecting the shortage of skills in those areas.  Pay growth inservices firms had remained below that in manufacturing firmsoverall, with a larger number of staff on pay freezes, thoughsome services subsectors had started to see an increase invariable pay alongside rising activity.  More generally, a greateruse of profit or merit-related pay had continued to bereported.  A range of companies reported lower startingsalaries than a year earlier, alongside a wider shift in thecomposition of recruitment towards more junior staff.  Therecontinued to be a mix of reports on the effect ofauto-enrolment, but pension costs overall were reported tobe increasing, either directly or through added administrativecosts.
Non-labour costs
Annual inflation in material costs had remained subdued(Chart 5 ).  Many materials costs were reported to be little
changed or lower than a year ago.  The main exceptions to thatpattern were higher energy costs, which were also feedingthrough into the price of some energy-intensive materials, andincreases in the cost of a range of foods.  The price of someconstruction materials, such as speciality bricks andaggregates, had also risen.  Moderate inflation in importedfinished goods prices had continued, despite subdued globaldemand, as the depreciation of sterling since late 2012 hadcontinued to pass through gradually and as wage costs inChina had risen.
Output prices and margins
The rate of inflation in manufacturers’ output prices had edgedlower in recent months, as an easing in input cost pressureshad fed through ( Chart 5 ).  Business services price inflation
had remained subdued, and in some subsectors offering‘commoditised’ services, such as audit, recruitment, propertymanagement and some parts of advertising, fees werereported to be lower than a year earlier, reflecting strongcompetitive pressures.  But in some professional and financial4

services, rising demand had allowed for some — often
long-delayed — pass-through of cost increases.  Moregenerally, where output prices were rising, that was oftenreported to reflect the pass-through of energy or food pricerises or to be confined to niche high value-added areas.Profitability in manufacturing and services had edged higherover the past year.  That had largely reflected increasingbusiness volumes, companies’ efforts to increase efficiency andproductivity, or in some cases the introduction of newproducts and/or a shift towards more profitable lines of work.Overall, however, profitability remained somewhat lower thanpre-crisis norms.
Consumer prices
Retail goods and services price inflation had remainedunchanged.  Increases in food prices had continued tocontribute moderately to goods price inflation, though recent
falls in global grain prices were likely to ease food pricepressures over the second half of the year.  Discounting onclothing and footwear prices had been little changed on ayear earlier and prices over the coming year were expected tobe flat or to increase only modestly.  There were reports of aneasing in the discounting of new cars, though prices were atmost only slightly up on a year earlier.  Inflation in consumerservices prices was often reported to have remained limitedoutside administered and regulated prices, such as those forutilities, social housing rents and public transport.  Moregenerally, retail goods and services companies reporteddifficulty in passing on price increases, except in luxury sectorscatering to wealthy individuals, reflecting tight disposableincomes among most consumers and a high price sensitivityof demand.
