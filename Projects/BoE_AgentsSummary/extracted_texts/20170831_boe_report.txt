This publication generally covers intelligence gathered from business contacts between June and mid-July 2017.  It generally makes 
comparisons with activity and prices over the past three months on a year earlier.  Agents’ summary of business conditions
August 2017 Update
•	Consumer spending growth had eased slightly further in values terms.  Manufacturing output growth had risen 
again, with exports supported by the past fall in sterling.  Investment intentions were consistent with modest 
growth in spending over the year ahead.
•	Recruitment difficulties had edged higher and broadened slightly.  Pay awards were clustered around 2%–3%.
•	Consumer goods price inflation had picked up further, largely reflecting the effects of the past fall in sterling 
feeding through into retail prices.  Consumer services price inflation had also edged higher. 
Consumer spending  growth had slowed slightly further 
(Chart 1 ).  Some contacts ascribed this to increased caution 
among consumers, and to consumers trading down to cheaper 
products or brands.  Growth in value terms was supported by 
price inflation, with growth weaker in volume terms.
Business services  turnover growth had continued at a 
moderate pace ( Chart 2) .  Services exports growth had 
remained steady.
Manufacturing output  growth had strengthened again 
(Chart 3 ).  Activity in export supply chains had increased, and 
there was some pickup in import substitution.  Demand from 
the oil and gas sector had also edged up.
Construction output  growth remained modest, with stronger 
growth in housebuilding in several regions offset by weaker 
growth in other sectors.  There were also more reports of 
constraints from access to skills and materials.
Investment intentions  remained modestly positive overall 
(Chart 4 ).  Contacts had continued to invest to drive efficiency 
improvements, and some exporters were investing to increase 
capacity.  Uncertainty, however, continued to weigh on some 
firms’ longer-term spending plans.
Credit availability  had improved slightly for small companies.  
Financing remained readily available generally.  Corporate 
credit demand had remained muted. 
Investor demand for UK commercial real estate  had 
continued to increase.  Occupier demand remained resilient 
and vacancy rates generally remained low.Housing market  activity had remained muted.  The market for 
new homes remained stronger overall than the secondary 
market, supported by Help to Buy.
Capacity utilisation  had increased marginally for 
manufacturers, remaining slightly higher than normal;  
utilisation for the service sector remained at normal levels.
Overall employment intentions  remained modest.  Service 
sector employment intentions reflected the slight pickup in 
activity earlier in the year within professional business services.  
Growth in manufacturing intentions was stable and was 
dampened by a stronger focus on productivity improvements 
and automation over job creation.
Recruitment difficulties  had edged higher, and were  
gradually broadening across sectors and skill areas.  Despite 
this, labour cost  growth had been modest, with pay awards 
clustered around 2%–3%.
Input cost  inflation remained heightened, though some 
manufacturing contacts reported that initial pass-through of 
the past fall in sterling into input costs was nearing completion 
(Chart 5 ).  Manufacturing output price  inflation had risen 
slightly.  A number of food sector contacts reported continuing 
difficulties in passing through input cost rises.
Consumer goods price inflation  had risen further ( Chart 6 ), 
as past increases in import costs fed through and foreign 
currency hedges ran off.  Some contacts across a range of 
sectors indicated that goods price inflation was reaching its 
peak.  Inflation in retail services prices continued to edge 
higher. Agents’ summary of business conditions   August 2017 Update 2
