October 2012Demand
Consumption
Spending on consumer goods and services continued to grow
at a gradual pace.  But the weather, together with sportingevents over the summer, had affected the type and timing ofpurchases.  After a disappointing summer for many non-foodretailers and consumer services firms, sales had picked upmodestly in the early autumn.  Shifts in market share, awayfrom the high street and mid-market retailers and towardsdiscount stores and destination shopping centres, remainedthe main feature of firms’ growth, rather than any significantpick up in overall spending.  Promotional activity was still seenas essential in order to stimulate demand, as householdsfocused on finding value for money.  Consumers continued tocut costs in various ways, for instance using public transportrather than their own cars, substituting cheaper brands orsupermarket own label for more expensive ones, or shoppingmore frequently in order to minimise food waste.  But despitethe pressures on household disposable incomes, sales of moreluxury goods such as technology and jewellery remainedbuoyant.
Housing market
Activity in the housing market picked up slightly in the pastmonth, following the usual seasonal lull associated with theschool holidays, which had been exacerbated by the distractionof the Olympics for potential buyers.  Contacts expressedconcern though that this pickup would not be sustained, ascontinuing worries about the economic outlook restrained bothpotential buyers and sellers.  Buy-to-let investors still made upa larger proportion of property sales in the lower stamp dutybracket, compared to before the recession.  Would-behomeowners and those near the bottom of the housing ladderwere still constrained by the lack of a sufficient deposit, creditand confidence.  Mortgage availability had continued toimprove slowly, but lending criteria remained tight.  Sales ofnew houses continued to fare somewhat better in comparisonto the secondary market, supported by government anddeveloper initiatives, especially for first-time buyers.
Business investment
Investment intentions had continued to ease back, suggestingthere would be little change in the level of capital spending byfirms over the next six months ( Chart 1 ).  Uncertainty about
future growth prospects remained the key constraint.  Themain factors driving investment were still cost savings,replacement cycles, new products and compliance with healthand safety and environmental legislation.  Reports of capitalexpenditure on new capacity fell further, even amongstexporters, who having previously anticipated stronger growthhad now revised down their expectations.  Where investmentcycles were typically over much longer periods, in sectors suchas energy, utilities and transport, spending plans had held upsomewhat better.  Spending on IT and online sales channels
remained significant, especially for service sector firms.
Exports
Export growth had continued to slow over the past month, asspending in the euro area weakened further.  Despite therecent slowing in orders though, most contacts remainedoptimistic that exports would still increase over the next year.Firms were increasingly wary of the credit risks associated withselling in Europe.  In response, an increasing number had eithertightened payment terms or even refused orders where the riskof non-payment was considered to be too great.  There weremore examples in the past month of firms losing orders toEuropean competitors.  But this was thought to reflectextreme measures by some foreign firms to sustain output, atany price, in the face of weak demand rather than morewidespread competitive pressures due to the appreciation ofsterling against the euro this year.  And some UK firms hadwon orders as a result of customer concerns about the viabilityof foreign suppliers.  There were more signs of a slowdown inthe rest of the world, notably in Asia.  But market share gainsfor many firms were mitigating much of these effects.  Andsmaller firms, especially, continued to increase their efforts towin orders in markets outside Europe.
Output
Business services
Turnover in the business services sector was still increasing at agradual pace ( Chart 2 ).  The volume of activity continued to
edge higher, compared to a year ago, while intensecompetition was keeping prices from rising.  Reports remainedmixed across sectors and tended to reflect trends in the widereconomy.  Unsurprisingly given the relative strength of capitalspending on IT, firms advising on hardware systems, softwareand online sales were experiencing strong growth.  Andmarketing firms, working with clients to expand into newmarkets, were also busy.  Firms involved in preparatory workfor longer-term projects in areas such as energy, utilities andtransport infrastructure were also seeing growth.  But for2

others, in corporate hospitality, transport, warehousing and
recruitment services, growth had weakened as customerstightened spending further.
Manufacturing
Output slowed further over the past month and was nowbroadly flat on a year ago ( Chart 2 ).  The slowdown had
become more widespread, reflecting lower spending byhouseholds, businesses and the public sector in theUnited Kingdom and overseas.  Although firms in theaerospace, automotive and energy sectors were stillexperiencing modest growth there were some signs thatshrinking order books were already having an impact on supplychains as inventories were reduced.  For manufacturers ofbuilding materials and capital goods for the constructionsector, output continued to fall.  Greater uncertainty aboutfuture growth prospects had also increased volatility in orderbooks and stock holdings, which had led to sizable changes inproduction volumes month on month.
Construction
The level of construction output remained down on a year ago,as the slow recovery in private sector activity was below thescale needed to replace public sector projects as they reachedcompletion ( Chart 2 ).  There had though been some catch up
of activity more recently following weather-related disruptionon sites earlier in the year.  The strongest boost to outputcontinued to stem from infrastructure projects, especially inutilities, energy and transport.  And private house building hadpicked up further.  But there was little in the way of newcommercial property development and, overall, the pace ofretail expansion was now somewhat slower than before.Confidence and credit constraints remained significant dragson private sector activity.
Credit conditions
For many companies the cost of borrowing appeared to bestabilising, albeit at levels well above a year ago.  Typically,larger firms, especially those with strong balance sheets, had
access to credit on good terms.  And those with sufficient scaleto access capital markets reported healthy investor demandfor corporate bonds.  But some smaller firms still struggled tosecure credit.  Lenders were often demanding higher levels ofsecurity, exacerbating issues faced by some smaller businessesthat were unable or unwilling to provide sufficient guaranteesor collateral.  Firms in sectors such as property, constructionand retail continued to find borrowing more difficult thanmost.  Demand for credit however, also remained subdued.And many firms were still building larger cash buffers andfunding a greater proportion of their working capital andinvestment requirements internally than before the crisis.  Thefunding for lending scheme had yet to have a significant effecton lending conditions, although reports of participation bylenders had increased further.  For many contacts though, itwas thought to be too early to expect a noticeableimprovement in lending conditions, given the typical timeperiods associated with new loan applications.  On residentialmortgages, the lower cost of funding was expected to bepassed through to mortgage rates, but intentions among thoselending to companies were more varied.  Some lendersintended to offer a price discount, while others were waivingassociated fees.
Employment
Employment intentions indicated there would be little overalljob creation in the private sector over the next six months.While those in manufacturing still experiencing strongergrowth were increasing headcount, firms more exposed toweaker spending by households and the public sectorcontinued to shed jobs.  There was no evidence though of aplanned shakeout of employment, despite the recentslowdown in demand.  The retention of key skills and the highcosts associated with redundancies continued to act as a brakeon future job losses.  Indeed some firms had stepped up theirrecruitment of graduates and apprentices in anticipation offuture skills shortages.  While regulatory compliance andresponding to issues such as the mis-selling of paymentprotection insurance were also supporting employment in thebusiness services sector, continuing consolidation throughmergers and firm exits was likely to result in job losses over thecoming months, leaving employment broadly flat overall.Changes in consumer services employment reflected widertrends in spending, with some firms, especially discountretailers, increasing employment numbers as new storesopened, while closures on the high street served to drag downoverall employment in the sector.
Capacity utilisation
In sectors where growth remained stronger, firms were oftenoperating close to capacity.  But manufacturers, especially54321012345

–Three months on the same period a year earlierChart 2 Annual growth in manufacturing and
construction output and services turnoverthose exporting to the euro area, had seen capacity utilisation
fall back recently ( Chart 3 ).  There was further evidence of
business closures and mergers in both the construction andprofessional services sectors, but to date this had only had alimited impact on the extent of excess capacity.  Businessdevelopment activity, especially in professional services,continued to absorb some of this slack, as did regulatorycompliance in financial services.  But competitive pressuresremained intense, in particular in sectors such as accountancy,law and property, as firms competed for market share.  Thevolume of empty commercial property space remainedsubstantial, but had not risen sharply recently, perhapsreflecting a lack of appetite to break leases on the part oftenants, especially among retailers, coupled with thewillingness of some landlords to offer rent reductions ortemporary deals.
Costs and prices
Labour costs
Growth in labour costs per employee remained modest.  Paysettlements in manufacturing had eased in recent months andwere now, on average, broadly the same as those in the servicesector.  Most pay awards were typically between 2% and 3%.But a significant minority of firms continued to freeze pay.Wage inflation remained especially low in consumer-facingfirms, construction and property-related businesses.  The weakeconomic outlook, together with falls in inflation in the pastyear was expected to restrain awards further over the nexttwelve months.  But pension liabilities, arising from risingdefined benefit scheme deficits, were expected to push up onlabour costs over the coming year, as was the implementationof pension auto-enrolment rules.  The trend towardperformance-related pay awards rather than across-the-boardincreases had continued.
Non-labour costs
Non-labour input cost inflation remained modest, butcontacts thought it less likely that inflation would fall furtherover the rest of the year, following the recent price increases of
oil, cereals and some basic foodstuffs.  While the price of steeland other metals had fallen back compared to a year ago,oil-related inputs, such as plastics and packaging, had startedto rise again.  Energy continued to be a significant driver ofcost inflation for firms, albeit at a lower rate than in recentyears.  Imported goods prices remained higher than a year ago.But the rate of inflation continued to slow, helped by theappreciation of sterling against the euro and the slowing inglobal growth.
Output prices
Domestic manufacturing output price inflation continued toease ( Chart 4 ), in response to past falls in input costs and
weaker demand.  The resultant increase in spare capacity overthe past year was thought to be having more of an effect inlimiting firms’ ability to raise prices in the near term.  Inconstruction, tender prices remained weak, but continuing firmfailures, especially among sub-contractors, were expected tolimit further falls.  Business services prices were still largelyunchanged on a year ago ( Chart 4 ).  Firms continued to find it
hard to increase prices, given the sustained competitivepressures.  And contacts often reported downward pressure onfees for more standardised services such as the auditing ofcompany accounts, property management and hotelaccommodation and conferencing.
Consumer prices
The recent fall in consumer goods price inflation had slowed,as a result of renewed increases in some fresh food and energyprices.  Food price inflation was expected to edge up over theremainder of the year, as recent increases in the prices ofcereals, vegetables and other fresh food fed through to meatand processed food prices.  Some of this was expected to beoffset by further slowing of inflation in the price of otherimported goods.  Consumer services price inflation remainedslightly higher, reflecting previous increases in the prices ofservices such as public transport and social housing.  Much ofthis was based on official measures of inflation in 2011 andwould therefore ease in the next round of price-setting.4

–Ability to meet expected demand over the next six monthsChart 3 Capacity utilisationAgents’ survey on exports
ONS data suggest that goods exports have grown more rapidly
than services exports in the years since the start of therecession.  The Agents conducted a survey of businesscontacts’ export activities to see whether goods and servicesexporters had seen different trends in activity over the pastfew years and to help assess prospects for the nexttwelve months.  In total 297 companies participated in thesurvey, of which 93 were services firms.
(1)Service sector
responses were skewed towards ‘non-financial’ firms.
The majority of firms reported substantial growth in exports
since 2007 ( Chart A ).  The results for goods exporters
appeared consistent with those recorded in the officialstatistics.  But service sector respondents’ experiences seemedstrong relative to the official data.  That strength may in partreflect the under-representation of financial services in thesample, where exports have been significantly weaker duringthe recession.
Firms reported that growth in recent years had been driven
mainly by increased market share in new and existing markets.Respondents had taken a range of actions to help penetratenew markets:  including the development of overseassubsidiaries and partnerships and increasing their marketingspend and UK sales teams.  These responses fit the flow ofintelligence reports received by the Agents in recent years, inwhich many contacts have described efforts to break into newmarkets at a time when their core ones have been stagnant.Stronger overseas demand and the boost to competitivenessfrom the depreciation of sterling were also widely regarded ashaving boosted export activity, while tighter credit conditionswere not thought to have restrained growth significantly overthis period.
Looking forwards, most firms expected further growth in
exports over the next twelve months ( Chart B ).  These resultswere consistent with agency intelligence in recent months —
in which contacts have reported that they continued to budgetfor growth despite a slowdown in recent sales.  Surveyrespondents whose primary export market was the euro areareported both slower export growth since 2007 and weakerexpectations of growth in comparison to those exporting tonon euro area countries.  And those with Asia as their mainmarket in particular had typically seen stronger growth since2007.  But on balance these firms did not expect to see suchstrong growth going forwards.
Increases in market share in new and existing markets were
considered by the majority of respondents to be the mainfactor driving growth over the next year ( Chart C ).  And
growth in overseas demand was also expected to increaseexports over the next year for a positive net balance ofrespondents.  Recent currency movements however, wereexpected to act as a drag on goods exports — particularly tothe euro area.Agents’ summary of business conditions October 2012 5
