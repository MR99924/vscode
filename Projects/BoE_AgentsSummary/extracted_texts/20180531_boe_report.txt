The adverse weather in February and March contributed to a 
marked slowdown in retail sales values  and consumer services 
growth  (Chart 1 ). Store-based retailers reported significant sales 
declines. Consumer services , such as restaurants, cinemas and 
hotels, were also badly affected, and most did not expect to 
recoup sales lost as a result of the weather disruption. Car sales 
had fallen in March, mainly due to strong year-ago comparisons 
and uncertainty about the tax policy for diesel cars. 
Business services  growth remained moderate ( Chart 2 ). There 
was a slight pickup in insolvency and restructuring work, robust 
growth in asset management and firm demand for IT services. 
However, discretionary spending by corporates, eg on events and 
hospitality, remained weak. Services exports  continued to be 
boosted by inward tourism and growth in UK retailers’ overseas 
online sales. UK-based professional services firms saw growth in 
demand for Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) advice from overseas 
clients. Demand for services from the oil and gas sectors edged up. 
Domestic manufacturing output  growth had been affected by 
the weather and weaker activity in the construction and 
automotive sectors ( Chart 2 ).  Some manufacturers benefited 
from some reshoring of sourcing to the UK, exporters generally 
outperformed firms focused on the domestic market. Goods 
export volumes to the EU remained strong, with limited evidence 
of reluctance to award longer-term contracts to UK companies. 
There were concerns about a rise in trade protectionism. 
Construction  output growth had slowed further ( Chart 2 ). That 
was largely due to the poor weather, but some projects had been 
delayed following the collapse of Carillion. Contacts expected to 
make up weather-related delays, but some would not be able to 
do so until after Q2 due to capacity constraints.  
Investment intentions  remained modest, reflecting continued 
uncertainty around Brexit ( Chart 3 ). Investment intentions were 
positive in business services and manufacturing, and some firms 
planned to invest in expanding capacity for exports, as well as in 
automation to counter rising labour costs. Consumer services 
firms’ intentions remained weak.  
Corporate demand for credit remained subdued, reflecting strong 
cash balances and/or heightened uncertainty. There had been demand for finance to support M&A activity, and some firms had 
undertaken pre-emptive refinancing ahead of Brexit. Supply of 
credit  had tightened slightly for small firms. 
Investor demand in commercial real estate  had continued to 
outstrip supply, particularly for logistics premises. Retailers had 
continued to reduce their shop premises and the resulting increase 
in vacant units had depressed valuations in the sector.  
Housing market  activity remained subdued overall. Demand had 
softened in the secondary market, where supply was also weak, 
whereas demand had been robust for new-build homes, 
supported by the Help to Buy scheme. There was some excess 
supply in the south and excess demand in the north: on balance 
there was a modest excess of supply overall. Lending conditions 
continued to be very favourable. However, slim margins on 
standard mortgage products had led some lenders to focus on 
more profitable niche segments of the market. 
Capacity utilisation  in manufacturing had risen ( Chart 4 ), 
following increases among exporters and some domestic 
manufacturers, particularly where demand for substitutes for 
imports had increased. Business and professional services firms 
reported some capacity constraints but there was excess capacity 
in the retail sector.
Recruitment difficulties  had broadened across skills and sectors, 
which was reported to be partly due to reduced availability of  
EU migrant workers. Employment intentions had ticked up in 
manufacturing but remained weak in consumer services, due to 
higher labour costs and weak sales. 
Growth in total labour costs  had edged up ( Chart 5 ), reflecting 
slightly higher pay settlements than in 2017 and the increase in 
employers’ pensions auto-enrolment contributions. Pay 
settlements had typically been in the 2½–3½% range, with 
higher awards targeted at retaining staff with key skills.  
The effect of past sterling depreciation on imported goods and 
material costs  had been waning but was being partially replaced 
by global commodity price inflation. Consumer goods price 
inflation  had eased slightly ( Chart 6 ), and consumer services 
inflation  was broadly stable. •	Consumer spending growth slowed markedly, in part due to adverse weather. 
•	Recruitment difficulties became more broad-based; total labour cost growth rose.

Agents’ survey on exports
The Agents surveyed business contacts about how the sterling 
volumes and values of their UK exports had changed in the 
past 12 months, how they would evolve over the next  
12 months and also in the following year (the year to  
March/April 2020). Contacts were also asked how different 
factors would affect the sterling value of their exports over the 
coming 12 months and how export margins had changed since 
November 2015. Around 260 companies responded. Results 
were weighted by export turnover and, for the headline results, 
reweighted by the goods and services shares of UK exports.
The survey showed that over the past 12 months, respondents 
had seen an increase in both the sterling value and volumes of 
their UK exports, as companies benefited from the 
depreciation of sterling and strengthening global activity. The 
net balance was stronger for values than volumes ( Chart A ). 
The net balances for expected values growth over the next  
12 months were lower than those for the past 12 months, as 
the more immediate price effects from sterling depreciation 
dissipate. Growth in export volumes was expected to hold up 
though, with the net balance slightly higher compared with 
the past 12 months. However, looking ahead to the year to 
March/April 2020, net balances for both export values and 
volumes growth were lower, but still positive.
Of the factors likely to affect export values over the next  
12 months ( Chart B ), demand in existing overseas markets was 
expected to provide the biggest boost to exports growth, with 
almost two thirds of weighted respondents expecting this to 
help increase export values. Entry into new markets was also 
seen as supporting exports growth, in line with reports of 
companies exploring markets beyond the EU to mitigate the 
impact of Brexit. 
Uncertainty around the UK’s future trading arrangements was 
expected to have the largest negative effect on exports. And potential future changes to tariff and non-tariff barriers, as 
well as changes to supply chains due to Brexit were also 
expected to weigh on export values over the next 12 months.
Compared with results from last year’s survey ( Chart C ) when 
a similar question was asked, the effect of uncertainty around 
future trading arrangements, changes to supply chains due to 
Brexit, and relocation of production were expected to weigh 
more heavily on export values over the next 12 months. By 
contrast, the net balances for the factors expected to have a 
positive effect on export values were similar to last year. 
Companies were also asked about their export margins. On 
balance, exporters reported that margins had improved since 
November 2015 when sterling began its depreciation. 
However, just over a third of goods exporters reported 
reductions in their export margins as higher input costs 
partially offset the benefit of weaker sterling, with some 
finding it hard to pass on cost increases to customers. This 
compared with 5% of services exporters whose margins were 
reduced. 0510152025303540

(a) In last year’s survey (March/April 2017) respondents were asked how they thought various factors 
would affect the sterling value of UK exports over the next 12 months (ie the year to March/April 
2018). In this year’s survey a similar question was asked regarding the year to March/April 2019. Agents’ summary of business conditions  May 2018 Update       3
