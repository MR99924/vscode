Annual consumer spending  growth had remained resilient 
(Chart 1 ), but volumes growth was expected to ease during the 
year as prices rose.  Some retailers had seen stronger sales 
growth than expected.  Demand growth for new cars had 
eased.  Growth in spending on leisure activities had remained 
solid.  
Business services  turnover growth had been little changed, 
remaining moderate.  Activity at IT, logistics and transport 
companies had benefited from firm demand growth.
Manufacturing output  growth for domestic markets had been 
unchanged at modest rates ( Chart 2 ).  Some contacts reported 
increased sourcing from domestic suppliers due to the fall in 
sterling.  That decline, along with stronger global demand, had 
led to a rise in export volume growth.  
Investment intentions  had edged up, pointing to a small rise 
in spending in 2017 ( Chart 3 ).  Increasing exports and resilient 
consumer demand had encouraged a little more investment in 
new capacity.  But uncertainty had continued to weigh on 
investment spending plans.
Corporate credit availability  had been little changed, 
remaining above normal overall.  Demand for finance was 
muted.
Investor demand for UK commercial real estate  had risen 
from a low level.  That reflected increased interest from foreign 
investors.  Commercial rents were flat or rising modestly 
across the United Kingdom. Housing market  activity had been sluggish overall, and was 
expected to remain so over the coming year.  
Capacity utilisation  was broadly normal in both 
manufacturing and services.  In manufacturing, increased 
activity had taken up some remaining slack.  
Employment intentions  had edged up in business services, 
but pointed to little change in staffing overall in the next 
six months ( Chart 4 ).  Recruitment difficulties  had been little 
changed.  
A survey pointed to a slight rise in total labour cost  growth in 
the year ahead (see box on page 2).  That was partly due to 
difficulties in hiring and holding on to staff and costs from the 
forthcoming apprenticeship levy.  Economic uncertainty and 
difficulty in passing on cost increases were expected to drag on 
labour cost growth.  Basic pay settlements were, on average, 
expected to ease in 2017.
Input cost inflation  had risen further as sterling’s fall fed 
through ( Chart 5 ).  Manufacturing output price inflation had 
also risen.  It was expected to rise further as foreign exchange 
hedges expired. 
Consumer goods price inflation  had increased as the fall in 
sterling started to be felt, particularly in higher food and  
fuel prices ( Chart 6 ).  A wider range of goods prices were  
expected to be affected during the year, causing inflation to 
rise further.•	Consumer spending growth had remained resilient, but was expected to ease during the year as prices rose.  
Investment intentions had edged higher and pointed to small increases in spending during 2017.  Export volumes 
growth had risen due to the fall in sterling and stronger world growth.
•	Hiring plans had edged up, but pointed to little change in staffing overall in the next six months.  A survey 
indicated a modest rise in total labour cost growth in the year ahead (see box on page 2).  That was partly due to 
difficulties in hiring and holding on to staff and costs from the forthcoming apprenticeship levy.  
•	Price pressures had continued to build through supply chains following sterling’s fall.  So far, the main effect on 
consumer prices had been higher food and fuel prices.  But a wider range of goods prices were expected to be 
affected over the coming year, causing inflation to rise further.
This publication generally covers intelligence gathered from business contacts between late November 2016 and mid-January 2017.  It 
generally makes comparisons with activity and prices over the past three months on a year earlier.  The Update represents the aggregate 
view offered from business contacts across the whole of the United Kingdom.  More information on the Bank’s Agencies can be found at

Agents’ survey on pay and labour costs
The Agents have conducted an annual pay survey since 1998. 
The survey assesses private sector contacts’ pay settlements in 
the past year and expectations for the year ahead, along with 
key drivers behind expected changes to the annual rate of 
growth in total labour costs per employee.  This year 341 firms 
responded, with a combined employment of around 530,000 
staff.  Results have been weighted by employment and 
adjusted for differences in the sectoral employment 
composition of the survey compared with the economy as a 
whole.
 
The survey indicated expectations overall of a slight increase in 
the growth of total labour costs per employee in 2017 
(Chart A ).  Slower growth in consumer services and 
construction was expected to be more than offset by faster 
growth in manufacturing and business services. 
Respondents were asked about the factors expected to drive 
changes in the rate of total labour cost growth in 2017 relative 
to 2016 ( Chart B ).  Among the factors pushing up growth were 
difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff, higher consumer 
price inflation, increases in pension contributions and 
improving productivity.  The apprenticeship levy was 
commonly cited as a factor expected to push up labour cost 
growth, driving the positive net balance for the ‘Other’ 
category.  The costs of the apprenticeship levy would, however, 
not show up in official measures of employee compensation.
A number of factors were acting in the opposite direction.  In 
particular, companies’ ability to pass on cost increases to 
prices and economic uncertainty were expected to pull down 
labour cost growth per employee.  The National Living Wage 
(NLW) was also expected to push down total labour cost inflation in 2017, relative to 2016, as its rate of increase 
slowed.  
Some of the factors expected to push up total labour costs 
growth would be unlikely to be reflected in higher pay 
settlements — a narrower measure that excludes elements 
such as employer pension contributions, benefits, bonuses and 
pay increases targeted at particular members of staff.  Indeed, 
the average pay settlement was expected to ease in 2017 to 
2.2% from 2.7% in 2016 ( Chart C ), with the number of pay 
awards between 3% and 4% expected to fall significantly.  
Settlements were expected to moderate in all sectors, with the 
largest decline anticipated in consumer services, where some 
companies had made pay awards in 2016 that were beyond 
those strictly necessary to meet the NLW at that time. 20 15 10 50 51 01 52 02 5Ability to pass on cost
