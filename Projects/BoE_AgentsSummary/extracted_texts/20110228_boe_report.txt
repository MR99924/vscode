February 2011Demand
Consumption
The Agents’ score for retail sales continued to point to a
relatively gentle pace of annual growth, but had risen slightlycompared with last month ( Chart 1 ).  That reflected, in part,
some recovery of spending that had been postponed as aresult of the bad weather during December.  And the annualcomparison was flattered somewhat by the disruption causedby the snow in January 2010.  Given the fairly elevated pace ofretail goods inflation, the modest rate of growth in turnoverbelied rather weaker growth in real spending.  There wasthought to have been relatively little improvement in sales ofbig-ticket items.
The Agents’ score for turnover in consumer services continued
to weaken, despite better weather conditions in January, andpointed to fairly lacklustre growth compared to a year earlier.According to contacts, spending on consumer services,including meals out, hotel stays, and travel services, had beendisappointing.  Demand was expected to return, now thatweather conditions had improved.  But there was widespreadconcern about the impact on consumer spending, fromheadwinds for real disposable income growth.
Housing market
Concerns about future incomes and the possibility of furtherdeclines in house prices were thought to be continuing toweigh on activity in the housing market.  The lower end of themarket was particularly subdued.  That was partly a function ofthe difficulty faced by some potential first-time buyers insaving a deposit large enough to secure a mortgage.  Would-befirst-time buyers were helping to support rents and yields inthe rental market.  That had attracted buy-to-let investors,and increased the demand for rental property.
Business investment
Investment intentions continued to rise, with contacts in themanufacturing sector expecting reasonably strong investmentgrowth over the next twelve months.  The rise in the Agents’
score reflected, in part, reports that exporters were beginningto invest in additional capacity to keep up with rapid growth inforeign demand.  A number of contacts were investing to try toreduce their exposure to further increases in commodities andenergy prices.  More generally, investment intentions were stillunderpinned by the need to maintain and repair existingcapital, and the aim to boost efficiency.
Investment intentions were also rising in the services sector,
and pointed to a moderate pace of growth in spending overthe coming year.  Efficiency and productivity gains wereimportant drivers of investment growth for many firms, withspending still focused heavily on IT.  In professional andfinancial services there was also a significant amount of newinvestment under way in order to comply with regulatorychanges.  Hoteliers continued to invest in additional capacity,but were prepared to reappraise plans for further investment ifthere was no improvement in conditions in the sector.  Andthere was ongoing investment by retailers in new stores andwarehousing capacity.
Exports
Contacts reported that goods exports were increasing rapidly,and the Agents’ score edged a little higher on the month.  Therise in foreign demand was driven by emerging economies, buttrade with Germany was also thought to have been growingquickly, and activity in the United States had strengthenedsomewhat.  Along with rising world activity, a number ofcontacts recognised that the past depreciation of sterling washelping to boost trade.  Exports of electrical goods, and ofcomponents for use in the aerospace and automotiveindustries, had all been growing quite strongly.
There were some further reports of re-sourcing of inputs to
domestic suppliers, as rising transport and labour costs hadrendered some foreign producers less competitive.  But suchswitching was still not commonplace.
Output
Business services
The Agents’ score for the growth rate of turnover inprofessional and financial services continued to point to only agentle pace of recovery.  There had been a small increase in thescore compared to last month, with a number of contacts atlaw firms having seen a further rise in M&A activity.  Andsuppliers of IT services were still busy thanks to the focus ofinvestment in the wider economy.  Contacts in commercialproperty leasing reported that conditions had been difficult,with a large overhang of unlet space in many city locations.
The Agents’ score for other types of business services pointed
to a modest increase in activity compared to last year,2

although there had been a sizable drag from the wintry
weather.  Among hauliers, hoteliers, suppliers of conferencingfacilities, and firms related to the construction sector, therewere many reports of firms having fared badly.
Manufacturing
Output of the manufacturing sector continued to growstrongly on the back of overseas orders.  Suppliers to theaerospace and automotive sectors had seen rapid increases inoutput.  Production of medical and pharmaceutical products,food and packaging had also been growing strongly.  Butactivity among firms supplying to the domestic constructionsector was reported to have fallen.  And in the defence sector,financial constraints on governments, both in theUnited Kingdom and abroad, were beginning to be felt.
Construction
Reports of a severe impact on the sector from the extremeweather were confirmed this month.  Output was expected torecover as improvement in the weather permitted work to beresumed.  And there were some reports of a rise in repair andmaintenance work as a result of damage caused by the severeconditions.  Activity continued to be underpinned in part bylarge projects in London.  More widely, there were reports ofconstruction work related to transport, utilities and renewableenergy.  Consistent with intelligence on investment, the levelof activity was also supported by construction work on hotelsand retail premises.
Credit conditions
Large firms had seen further improvement in the availability ofcredit, and increased competition among lenders for businesshad brought the cost of borrowing down a little.  Butintelligence gathered from lenders continued to suggest thatthere would not be a return to the lower level of spreads seenprior to the recession.  Some larger firms had taken advantageof an increase in investors’ appetite for equity to lower theirratio of debt to equity finance.  Among smaller firms, there wasstill a strong perception that credit for working capital was notavailable.  That was acting as a disincentive to apply for loans.As a result, many firms were trying to preserve undrawnfacilities, in case they were needed at a later date.  Somecontacts reported that more secured credit had becomeavailable, but that they lacked the necessary skills, or time,needed to undertake what was felt to be a much moreinvolved applications process.  In some cases the amount ofcollateral required was considered too large, or contacts hadbeen discouraged by having to provide personal guarantees.
Employment
The Agents’ scores for employment intentions inmanufacturing and services pointed to modest growth inprivate sector employment over the next six months ( Chart 2 ).
The score for manufacturing stayed on its gentle upward path,driven by recruitment among exporters.  In professionalservices, employment was expected to continue to grow dueto rising activity among law and accountancy firms, financialsand IT specialists.  In the consumer sector, employmentintentions were bolstered by the need to recruit staff for newstores.  But rising concerns about the prospects for consumerspending were beginning to weigh on employment intentions.And several contacts hoped that improved management ofrosters, along with more flexible attitudes to working, wouldenable them to meet periods of peak demand withoutincreasing total headcount.  It was still easier than usual to findsuitable staff.  But for some specific skill sets, for instance, inengineering and IT, contacts reported that they were finding itmore difficult to recruit.
Capacity utilisation
In manufacturing, the level of capacity utilisation remainedaround normal.  A few contacts, particularly among exporters,were facing constraints however, and had begun investing tomeet further increases in demand.  But most were still able toraise output using existing resources, typically by increasingovertime or implementing additional shifts.  There were furtherreports of supply bottlenecks, in part due to the rapid pace ofgrowth in world activity.  In some cases these had beenexacerbated by firms’ decisions to operate with lower stocks ofinputs following the recession.  That had focused them onbecoming more adept at accommodating fluctuations indemand.  And some firms had begun to increase theirinventories of inputs in anticipation of hold-ups in the supplychain, or rising prices.  By contrast, there was still reported tobe considerable slack in services, although a degree of capacitywas thought to have been lost in some sectors.  For instance,in the airline industry, some of the less fuel-efficient aircraftthat had been mothballed during the recession were nowunlikely to be brought back into service.543210123

Labour costs
In manufacturing, the Agents’ score pointed to a pace of
growth in labour costs that was broadly in line with thehistorical average.  A further tick-up in the score on the monthreflected rising hours per employee, as well as some increasesin pay due to recognition of past wage restraint.  In contrast tothe pay round the previous year, there were now relatively fewreports of wage freezes.  In services, where the recovery wasnot yet as robust, there had been slightly less upward pressureon labour costs, and wage freezes were more common than inmanufacturing.  Compensation for high inflation over the pastyear had played a greater role in negotiations in both sectorsthan during the previous round (the box on page 5 describesthe results of a special survey on pay and labour costs).
Non-labour costs
The Agents’ score for inflation in the price of raw materialscontinued to indicate a fairly rapid pace of increase, and rosehigher on the month ( Chart 3 ).  Contacts reported that the
recent flooding in Australia had caused a significant increase inthe price of coking coal and iron ore, and that was adding toupward pressure on the price of steel.  Some cereals prices hadalso risen as a result of the flooding.  Along withweather-related disruptions to supply, global demand washelping to keep the cost of various other raw materials elevated,particularly for agricultural commodities, metals and energy.
Contacts reported that the costs of imported finished goods
were also rising ( Chart 4 ).  That was partly due to the increases
in the price of raw materials, and also because of higher labourcosts in some emerging economies.  These influences weremitigated to some extent by re-sourcing from other, lowercost, countries.
Output prices
The Agents’ score for manufacturing output price inflationincreased on the month ( Chart 3 ).  The start of the year was akey time for reviewing annual price lists, and many contacts
were taking the opportunity to pass on some of the rise in theircosts.  The degree of pass-through was still only partial,however.  Suppliers to food retailers found it difficult to passhigher costs on.  And in some cases, products had been alteredto lower the cost of ingredients or packaging.
The Agents’ score for business services prices continued to
point to a slight fall compared to a year earlier, but the pace ofdecline had eased further.  There was still downward pressureon fees for some professional and financial services.  And therewas particular weakness in construction, where tenders wereoften at below cost.  But some niche service providers,particularly in IT, had managed to raise their prices.  And therewere a few reports of firms having been able to pass on costincreases.  For instance, hauliers reported a degree of successin adding fuel surcharges for services.
Consumer prices
In line with expectations, most retail contacts reported thatthe bulk of VAT had been passed on in full, helping to push upthe Agents’ score for retail goods price inflation ( Chart 4 ).
There had also been upward pressure from the rising cost ofimports of finished goods, particularly food and clothing.Higher fuel and transport costs had also contributed to theincrease.  Helping to offset that, the snowy weather had leftsome retailers with more stock during the sales period thanthey had anticipated, which had caused them to discountmore heavily than planned.
The pace of inflation in consumer services was thought to be
similarly elevated and the Agents’ score rose on the month.Along with the increase in VAT, that reflected, in part, higherbus and rail fares due to higher fuel costs.  Restricted capacityin the airline industry had pushed up on air fares.  And theprices of motor and household insurance had continued torise.  Hotels and restaurants had endeavoured to keep pricesdown by adjusting menus and ingredients, but there wasthought to be diminishing scope to cut costs in that way.4

pricesAgents’ survey on pay and labour costs
Since 1998 the Agents have conducted an annual survey asking
contacts in the private sector about expected pay settlementsand total labour cost growth, and the key drivers of changes inthem.  377 firms responded to this year’s survey, with acombined UK employment of 905,000.  Unless otherwisestated, the data are weighted by employment.
According to the survey, 56% of contacts expected to award
the same pay settlement in 2011 as they did in 2010 ( Chart A ).
But there was a skew in the distribution of responses towardssomewhat higher settlements than last year, when there was ahigh incidence of only very small increases and outright payfreezes.  Overall, however, the survey tends to suggest a fairlymodest increase in the pace of growth of settlements in 2011compared to 2010.
Taking the mid-point of ranges specified for respondents, and
assuming that ‘significantly’ was, on average, equal to adding(or subtracting) an extra 2 percentage points to (or from) thesettlement awarded in 2010, a simple estimate suggestsexpected growth in settlements of around 2.1% in 2011(Chart B ).  By sector, the largest increases in settlements
compared to last year were in construction and businessservices.  That is likely to reflect, at least to some extent, verylow average settlements in those sectors in 2010.
Most of the firms surveyed expected total labour costs to rise
more quickly than last year ( Chart A ).  In addition to
settlements, total labour costs capture, among other things,changes in pay drift and bonuses.  And contacts in the samplereported that performance-related pay, overtime paymentsand rising profitability were all exerting upward pressure on
total labour costs ( Chart C ).  Somewhat surprisingly, however,
given that productivity and average hours might be expectedto rise during the recovery, these factors were reported to beexerting downward pressure on total labour costs.  That maybe because respondents were answering the question based, inpart, on expected labour costs per unit of output, rather thanper employee.
The outlook for inflation also featured prominently among the
factors thought to be exerting upward pressure on total labourcosts.  Comments from some of the contacts in the samplesuggested that it was the current rate of inflation, rather thanexpectations about future inflation, that was the mostsignificant factor.  The large positive net balance for otherinfluences captured a range factors, including higher NationalInsurance contributions and the increase in the NationalMinimum Wage.Agents’ summary of business conditions February 2011 5
