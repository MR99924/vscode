This publication generally covers intelligence gathered from business contacts between late August 2017 and mid‑October 2017.  
It generally makes comparisons with activity and prices over the past three months on a year earlier.Consumer spending  growth was little changed ( Chart 1 ).  Retail 
sales volumes had picked up slightly, but weak car sales had 
dragged on spending overall.  Consumer services turnover growth 
had been helped by strong growth in inbound tourism numbers, 
which were reported to be due to the fall in sterling.
Growth in business services  turnover had remained moderate 
(Chart 2 ).  Growth was supported in part by sustained mergers 
and acquisitions activity, including from some foreign investors, 
and by strong IT services spending in particular.
Manufacturing  output growth had strengthened further 
(Chart 3 ).  Exporters and their supply chains were benefiting from 
the fall in sterling and stronger global demand.  Some 
manufacturers reported increased sourcing from domestic 
customers.
Construction  output growth had eased ( Chart 4 ).  Uncertainty 
about economic prospects was reported to be slowing 
decision‑making around building projects.  Within the sector, 
housebuilding was showing the strongest growth.
A survey pointed to continued modest growth in investment  over 
the coming year, at a similar rate to that seen over the past 
twelve months (see the box on page 3).  Investment plans were 
being boosted by companies’ desire to increase their efficiency 
and to meet expected increases in demand, but expectations 
about the United Kingdom’s future trading relationships were 
dragging on spending.  Expectations of investment growth in the 
following two years were weaker.
Most companies reported that finance  was readily available, 
particularly for larger corporates.  Some large companies were refinancing or extending loans to benefit from the low rates 
currently available.
Outside London, investor demand for commercial real estate  had 
been modestly greater than available supply.  Demand for London 
property had been negatively affected by concerns about 
stretched property values.
Housing market  demand had strengthened overall.  Contacts 
reported a divergence in regional conditions, with signs of excess 
supply in London and the South, but some excess demand in most 
other parts of the United Kingdom.
Capacity utilisation  had remained slightly above normal in 
manufacturing and services.
Employment intentions  pointed to modest growth in staffing 
over the next six months.  Recruitment difficulties  had increased 
(Chart 5 ) and were above normal in a range of activities.  That 
had contributed to a slight increase in pay growth  (Chart 6 ), 
with expectations that settlements next year could be clustered 
around 2½%–3½% rather than 2%–3% during 2017.
Annual materials cost  inflation had fallen back overall.  The rate 
of inflation in manufacturers’ output prices  had plateaued.  
Business services price inflation  had remained moderate.  
Where contacts had not passed on fully increases in costs, 
they had sought to maintain their margins through increased 
efficiency.
Consumer price inflation  had remained unchanged, both for 
goods and services.  In groceries, pass‑through of higher import 
costs had been incomplete due to competitive pressures.•	Growth in activity had remained broadly stable.  Manufacturing output growth had risen again, with export 
supply chains supported by the past fall in sterling and some signs of increased domestic sourcing.  But 
construction output growth had eased.  Services turnover growth remained moderate.
•	A survey of investment intentions pointed to continued modest growth in spending over the coming year, at a 
similar rate to that seen over the past twelve months.  Expectations of investment growth in the following 
two years were weaker.
•	Recruitment difficulties had intensified and were above normal in a range of activities, alongside continued 
modest employment growth.  As a result, pay growth had edged up and was expected to be somewhat higher in 
2018 than this year.  But non‑labour input cost inflation had eased and both output and consumer price inflation 
were unchanged.Agents’ summary of business conditions

Agents’ survey on investment intentions
The Agents surveyed business contacts about changes to 
investment over the past twelve months and their plans for the 
twelve months ahead.  Additionally contacts were asked about 
expectations of average capital spending over the following 
two years, compared to the past twelve months.  The survey 
also asked how a range of factors were affecting these 
investment plans.  A total of 375 businesses responded to the 
survey, accounting for 578,000 UK employees and £7.6 billion 
of UK capital spending.  The survey results were weighted by 
employment.
Overall, firms in the survey expected investment growth to be 
little changed over the next twelve months, relative to the past 
twelve months.  However, investment growth was expected to 
be somewhat weaker over the following two years ( Chart A ).Expectations for investment growth in the coming 
twelve months were strongest for business services contacts, 
and were weakest — at broadly unchanged levels — for 
construction.  While the level of investment spending two to 
three years ahead was expected to be modestly higher across 
most sectors relative to the past year, spending in construction 
was expected to be lower.
Among factors driving investment decisions over the next year, 
the most positive influences were the desire to achieve future 
efficiency gains and to provide capacity to meet expected 
domestic and export demand ( Chart B ).  Economic uncertainty 
was the biggest drag on investment plans.  Expectations about 
future trading arrangements and other factors related to the 
United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union, such 
as concerns around the future availability of overseas labour, 
were also reported to be restraining investment.
