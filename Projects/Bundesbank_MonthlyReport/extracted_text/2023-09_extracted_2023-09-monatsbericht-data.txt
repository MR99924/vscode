Economic conditions
Underlying trends
German economic output will probably con -
tract somewhat in the third quarter of 2023. It 
is unlikely that private consumption will offer 
any discernible positive impetus. Households 
are still reluctant to spend despite the slight 
easing in price inflation, strong wage growth 
and favourable labour market. Alongside con -
sumer restraint, economic output is also being 
depressed by the growing weakness in indus -
try. The further fall in the already low level of 
new orders and weaker order books are having 
more and more of an impact on industrial out -
put. Higher financing costs are also likely to be 
contributing to weak domestic and foreign de -
mand.
Private consumption
The recovery in private consumption is likely to 
be delayed. In the retail sector, price- adjusted 
and seasonally adjusted sales in July were down 
on the previous quarter,1 with many areas af -
fected. Moreover, according to ifo Institute sur -
veys, the situation in the hotel and restaurant 
sector deteriorated significantly in July and Au -
gust. The consumer climate index compiled by 
market research institute GfK worsened for 
September compared with the previous period, 
thus remaining at a low level. By contrast, there 
is a possibility that car purchases might support 
private consumption. This is indicated by data 
on new passenger car registrations (available 
up to August) provided by the German Associ -
ation of the Automotive Industry (VDA). Weak 
private consumption is also having a negative 
impact on consumer-  related areas of the ser -
vices sector. Those services sectors more de -
pendent on industry are suffering from the 
weakness of the manufacturing sector. Accord -
ing to surveys by the ifo Institute, the assess -ment of business conditions in the services sec -
tor therefore deteriorated significantly overall. 
The Purchasing Managers’ Index for the ser -
vices sector also dropped below the expansion 
threshold for the first time this year.
Industry
Seasonally adjusted industrial output fell steeply 
in July on both the month and the quarter. Sec -
tors that had previously supported industrial 
output saw a substantial slump. This particu -
larly affected the manufacture of motor ve -
hicles and information processing equipment. 
While the VDA reported a slight increase again 
in the number of motor vehicles produced in 
August, the number of units was still below the 
level of the previous quarter. Energy- intensive 
sectors continued to suffer from high energy 
prices. According to survey data from the ifo 
Institute, the assessment of the current situ -
ation in the manufacturing sector deteriorated 
significantly, falling into negative territory for 
the first time since October 2020. This weak -
ness in industry is likely to continue, as indi -
cated by industrial new orders in July, for ex -
ample. Demand for industrial goods from both 
Germany and abroad fell sharply on the quar -
ter. Large orders, which had risen considerably 
in the previous quarter, were the main reason 
for this slump. However, even excluding large 
orders, there was a fall in orders compared 
with the previous quarter. The trend decline in 
demand continued in most areas. Higher finan -
cing costs are likely to be having a negative im -
pact on demand for capital goods. Further -
more, the diminishing order backlog is less and 
less of a cushion against the lack of new orders.

months point to a further decline in industrial 
activity, according to ifo Institute surveys.
Labour market
The labour market remained stable until re -
cently despite the currently subdued economic 
environment. In July, employment rose margin -
ally by 15,000 persons in seasonally adjusted 
terms. Prior to this, the strong employment 
growth recorded in the first quarter had be -
come progressively weaker during the second 
quarter, before grinding to a complete halt in 
June. This was due, amongst other things, to 
the slackening growth in employment subject 
to social security contributions. According to 
the latest provisional estimates of the Federal 
Employment Agency up to June, employment 
of this kind stagnated recently. The weak econ -
omy led to slight declines in temporary employ -
ment, trade and also in the manufacturing sec -
tor. By contrast, a continued positive develop -
ment in employment was seen in some services 
sectors which are less affected by cyclical fluc -
tuations. This primarily concerned health and 
social services and the public sector, but also 
the IT sector and some business services. In 
June, the use of cyclical short- time work re -
mained at only a slightly elevated level in eco -
nomic terms. The number of short- time work 
notifications even declined in July and August. 
However, this could also be related to the fact 
that the last special arrangements to simplify 
the use of short- time work expired at the end 
of June. This is therefore not indicative of any 
economic easing. Leading indicators also sug -
gest that there will be little change in employ -
ment in the coming months. The number of 
vacancies reported to the Federal Employment 
Agency fell further, but is still quite high.
After adjustment for seasonal variations, regis -
tered unemployment rose slightly by 18,000 
persons to 2.63 million in August. Rounding 
meant that the unemployment rate remained 
at 5.7%. The increase affected both unemploy -

under the statutory unemployment insurance 
scheme, which predominantly reflects cyclical 
developments, and the number of persons re -
ceiving the basic welfare allowance. Thus, both 
the weak economic situation and the processes 
of integrating immigrants into Germany’s po -
tential labour force raised unemployment 
slightly. Nevertheless, in view of the current 
strains, unemployment is very stable at a com -
paratively low level. The unemployment bar -
ometer of the Institute for Employment Re -
search deteriorated somewhat recently and 
points to a further slow rise in unemployment 
in the autumn.
Commodity prices
Energy and commodity prices recently picked 
up again somewhat overall following substan -
tial declines in the first half of the year. In the 
crude oil markets, production cuts by Saudi 
Arabia and Russia are likely to have propped up 
prices, in particular. A barrel of Brent crude oil 
recently cost US$93, which is just under 17% 
more than in July. Future deliveries are being 
traded at significant discounts. European 
wholesale gas prices have also risen somewhat 
recently and stand at €36 per megawatt hour 
at the current end. This was mainly due to 
strikes at Australian exporters of liquefied nat -
ural gas.
After seasonal adjustment, prices at the up -
stream stages of the economy fell significantly 
in some cases in July. This is true of both im -
ports and domestic industrial producer prices. 
Import prices fell somewhat more sharply when 
excluding energy than overall. By contrast, the 
decline in domestic producer prices was mainly 
attributable to energy prices. Prices for inter -
mediate goods were also appreciably lower. 
Import prices, in particular, fell significantly 
short of their previous year’s level overall.Inflation rate
In August, the Harmonised Index of Consumer 
Prices (HICP) rose significantly by a seasonally 
adjusted 0.5% on the month, following a rise 
of only 0.1% in July. Whilst energy prices went 
up again markedly, unprocessed food saw an -
other slight decrease. Inflation was above aver -
age for non- energy industrial goods and ser -
vices, partly owing to the volatile clothing and 
travel components. Looking at the year- on- year 
figure, the annual HICP rate dropped only mar -
ginally from 6.5% to 6.4%.2 The base effect 
stemming from the temporary fuel rebate and 
the “€9 ticket” from June to August 2022 still 
had a price- driving effect. The core rate exclud -
ing the volatile energy and food components 
went up slightly from 6.2% to 6.3%. The base 
effect owing to the €9 ticket is even more 
prominent here than for the headline rate. 
However, even without this one- off effect, the 
core rate remained at an exceptionally high 
level of around 5½%.
In the next few months, both headline HICP in -
flation and the core rate are likely to come 
down further in Germany. In September 2023, 
for example, the price- driving base effects re -
sulting from the fuel rebate and the €9 ticket 
will lapse. Furthermore, the significant price de -
clines at the upstream stages are likely to be 
passed on gradually to consumers. Given ro -
bust wage growth, however, the inflation rate 
is likely to remain well above 2% in the me -
dium term, too.Commodity

Public finances3
Statutory health insurance 
scheme
The statutory health insurance (SHI) scheme 
(comprising the health insurance institutions 
and the health fund) recorded a deficit of 
€2½ billion in the second quarter of 2023. This 
figure was €2 billion higher than in the same 
quarter of the previous year. The deterioration 
reflects the legal situation, in which there was 
a focus on using more reserves from the health 
fund and health insurance institutions to limit 
the increase in average supplementary contri -
bution rates. The lion’s share (€2 billion) of the 
deficit is attributable to the health fund.
SHI scheme revenue was 7% lower than in the 
same quarter of the previous year. The main 
reason for this was that central government 
provided significantly reduced funds to the 
health fund: owing to lower benefits relating to 
the pandemic and the energy crisis, it reim -
bursed only €½ billion (same quarter of the 
previous year: €7 billion). At €½ billion, special 
funds from central government to stabilise con -
tributions were also significantly lower in the 
second quarter than in the previous year 
(€3½ billion). At 6½%, growth in contribution 
receipts was still substantial. Supplementary 
contribution rates rose by an average of just 
under 0.2 percentage point to 1.5%. Adjusted 
for this, growth in contribution receipts re -
mained strong (+5½%). This is due mainly to 
high nominal increases in wages and salaries.
Total SHI scheme expenditure was 4% lower 
than in the same quarter of the previous year. 
This was due mainly to pandemic- related bene -
fits petering out. Expenditure relating to the 
energy crisis remained tightly limited. By con -
trast, the health insurance institutions’ actual 
spending on benefits rose sharply (+5%). The 
fact that expenditure on medical treatment re -
mained virtually unchanged on the previous 
year had a dampening effect. In the previous 
year, it appears that large- scale obligations were booked as expenditure and did not sub -
sequently materialise. Meanwhile, spending on 
hospital treatment, a particularly large expend -
iture item, grew by 6%.4 Outlays on remedies 
and therapeutic appliances rose even more 
substantially (+8%). At 2%, expenditure growth 
for pharmaceuticals was markedly lower than 
previously. The measures introduced recently to 
curb spending appear to have had an impact 
here.
The figures published by the group of SHI esti -
mators in the fourth quarter of 2022 for 2023 
as a whole suggested a large deficit in the SHI 
scheme that was expected to amount to 
around €8 billion and be financed from re -
serves (especially in the case of the health 
fund). Furthermore, central government would 
issue a loan of €1 billion, to be repaid by the 
end of 2026. The health insurance institutions 
were set to post a deficit of €2 billion. The 
higher supplementary contribution rate of 
1.6% set by the Federal Ministry of Health is 
already taken into account here. Health insur -
ance institutions’ spending was projected to 
rise by 4½% compared with the then estimated 
result for 2022.
Developments to date point to a much better 
result: the health fund’s outturn in 2022 – the 
starting point for 2023 – was far better than 
expected. In addition, last year’s very positive 
development in contribution receipts con -
tinued. In the first half of the year, the increase 
(adjusted for changes in supplementary contri -
bution rates) stood at almost 6% (+2 percent -
age points compared with what was expected 
by the group of SHI estimators in the fourth 
quarter of 2022). No stronger slowdown is cur -Higher deficit in

rently expected for the remainder of the year. 
The health insurance institutions likewise 
started 2023 on a good footing after having 
closed 2022 with a better- than- expected result. 
Nevertheless, the health insurance institutions’ 
result may be somewhat less favourable than 
envisaged. This is because supplementary con -
tribution rates remained, on average, just under 
0.1 percentage point below the rate needed to 
cover expenditure as calculated by the Federal 
Ministry of Health. In addition, at 5%, expend -
iture on benefits was around ½  percentage 
point higher in the first half of the year than 
anticipated by the group of SHI estimators.
Public long- term care 
insurance  scheme
The public long- term care insurance scheme’s 
result was close to balance in the second quar -
ter of 2023.5 The deferral of transfers to the 
long- term care provident fund in the amount 
of €½ billion to 2024 brought relief. A surplus 
of €½ billion had been recorded in the same 
quarter of the previous year, although this was 
due mainly to additional central government 
funds that were non- recurring.
Revenue fell by 7½%. This was driven mainly 
by the scheme not receiving central govern -
ment funds of €2 billion as it had done in the 
same quarter of the previous year. After adjust -
ment for this factor, revenue increased by 6%. 
Contribution receipts saw continued substan -
tial growth of 5½%.
Expenditure decreased by 3%. In addition to 
the deferred transfers to the long- term care 
provident fund, the sharp decline in pandemic- 
related expenditure (just over -€1 billion) also 
brought relief. Meanwhile, expenditure on 
regular benefits climbed by 9%. This means 
that core expenditure continued to rise much 
more sharply than contributions. Expenditure 
on outpatient and inpatient care, in particular, 
continued to grow strongly (+11%). At 7%, cash benefits went up steeply. Benefit rates re -
mained unchanged.
Overall, the long- term care insurance scheme 
could well end up generating a significant sur -
plus this year. It recorded a moderate deficit of 
€½ billion in the first half of the year. At mid- 
year, the contribution rate was raised by an 
average of 0.35  percentage point to 3.4% Close- to- balance

(staggered by number of children; childless in -
dividuals: 4.0%).6 This will generate additional 
revenue of just over €3 billion in the second 
half of the year. In addition, payments to the 
long- term care provident fund will not be made 
in the second half of the year either. All in all, 
therefore, a marked surplus is expected for the 
long- term care insurance scheme.
The scheme’s finances are expected to deteri -
orate next year, primarily as a result of the 
benefit expansions and adjustments that have 
already been adopted. In addition, there are 
plans to suspend the annual central govern -
ment grant of €1 billion between 2024 and 2027. In the same period, the replenishment of 
the long- term care provident fund will be re -
duced by €1 billion. In this respect, there will 
be no additional burden in the core area of the 
long- term care insurance scheme. All in all, the 
additional revenue generated by the higher 
contribution rate is expected to exceed the 
additional expenditure next year. The further 
dynamic adjustment of benefits as well as 
demographic developments will put increasing 
pressure on the long- term care insurance 
scheme’s finances in the years to come.
Securities markets
Bond market
At €120.5 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in July 2023 was down on the 
June figure (€168.7 billion). After taking ac -
count of redemptions and changes in issuers’ 
holdings of their own debt securities, the out -
standing volume of domestic bonds increased 
by €28.0 billion, after having increased by 
€22.9 billion in June. Foreign debt securities 
worth €0.5 billion were redeemed in the Ger -
man market. The outstanding volume of do -
mestic and foreign debt securities in Germany 
thus increased by €27.5 billion on balance.
The public sector issued own bonds in the 
amount of €27.0 billion net in the reporting 
month. Central government, in particular, in -
creased its capital market debt in net terms 
(+€24.2 billion). On balance, it mainly issued 
two- year Federal Treasury notes (Schätze: €5.8 
billion) and ten- year Federal bonds (Bunds: 
€5.6 billion), as well as Treasury discount paper 
(Bubills: €4.5 billion) and five- year Federal notes 
(Bobls: €4.0 billion). State and local govern -

German credit institutions increased their cap -
ital market debt by €1.0 billion net in July. On 
balance, the main instruments issued were 
other bank debt securities that can be struc -
tured flexibly and mortgage Pfandbriefe (€1.1 
billion and €0.7 billion, respectively). By con -
trast, the outstanding volume of debt securities 
issued by specialised credit institutions fell by 
€0.9 billion.
On balance, domestic enterprises were hardly 
active in the bond market in the reporting 
month. Non- financial corporations issued debt 
securities worth €1.1 billion net, while other 
financial institutions redeemed bonds in the 
same amount.
In July, foreign investors were the main buyers. 
They added a net €26.0 billion in domestic 
debt securities to their portfolios. Domestic 
non- banks acquired debt securities with a value 
of €9.7 billion net, with foreign paper being 
the main focus of interest. By contrast, German 
credit institutions pared back their bond port -
folios by €8.5 billion. Here, too, foreign instru -
ments were the main area of focus.
Equity market
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
placed €0.5 billion worth of new shares in the 
German equity market. The volume of foreign 
shares in the German market rose by €4.2 bil -
lion over the same period. Foreign investors 
were dominant on the buyers’ side of the mar -
ket, adding domestic shares worth €2.9 billion 
net to their portfolios. Domestic non- banks ac -
quired equities amounting to €1.9 billion net, 
while domestic credit institutions scaled back 
their equity portfolios by €0.1 billion net.
Mutual funds
In July, domestic mutual funds recorded inflows 
of €6.4 billion. The vast majority of these funds 
were channelled into specialised funds (€6.0 billion) reserved for institutional investors. Of 
the various asset classes, mixed securities-  
based funds (€5.3 billion) and open- end real 
estate funds (€1.2 billion) attracted the most 
investment. Only equity funds redeemed their 
own shares (€1.4 billion). Foreign mutual funds 
recorded inflows totalling €10.5 billion in the 
German market. On balance, domestic non-  
banks were the only purchasers of mutual fund 
shares in the month under review (€18.2 bil -
lion). By contrast, foreign investors and domes -
tic credit institutions pared back their invest -
ment in funds by €0.9 billion and €0.4 billion, 
respectively.

account and a depletion of that in invisible cur -
rent transactions, which comprise services as 
well as primary and secondary income.
The surplus in the goods account fell by €5.0 
billion to €18.8 billion as receipts recorded a 
sharper decline than expenditure.
Invisible current transactions shifted from a sur -
plus of €4.6 billion in June into a slight deficit 
of €0.1 billion. The expansion of the deficit in 
the services account by €3.2 billion to €8.1 bil -
lion made a considerable contribution to this. 
Receipts decreased overall, mainly as a result of 
lower revenue from telecommunications, com -
puter and information services as well as other 
business services. By contrast, expenditure in -
creased somewhat, also owing to higher 
spending on charges for the use of intellectual 
property and, in particular, the rise in travel ex -
penditure typical for this time of year. More -
over, the deficit in the secondary income ac -
count widened by €1.2 billion to €5.4 billion. 
This was mainly attributable to lower receipts, 
in which reduced general government revenue 
from current taxes on income and wealth 
played an essential role. By contrast, at €13.4 
billion, net receipts in the primary income ac -
count almost matched the previous month’s 
figure of €13.7 billion.
In July, a foreseeable end to rising policy rates 
in the United States shaped sentiment in the 
international financial markets. Germany’s 
cross- border portfolio investment recorded net 
capital imports of €15.7 billion (June: net cap -
ital exports of €15.0 billion), with non- resident 
investors increasing their holdings of German 
securities (€27.9 billion). On balance, they 
added bonds (€25.5 billion), shares (€2.9 bil -
lion) and a small amount of money market 
paper (€0.4 billion) to their portfolios, but dis -
posed of mutual fund shares (€0.9 billion). 
Conversely, German investors acquired €12.2

Germany as a business location: 
selected aspects of current dependencies 
and medium- term challenges
The German economy is under considerable pressure to adapt. Demographic change is weighing 
on prospects for growth and intensifying competition for skilled workers. In foreign trade, there 
are significant dependencies on China. A sudden break with China would likely bring about far- 
reaching disruptions to supply chains and production in the short term. In order to reduce 
dependence on imported fossil fuels and to supply low- emission energy at reasonable costs, it 
will be vital to expand the supply of renewable energy and to lower energy demand by increasing 
efficiency. Digitalisation may provide opportunities that could significantly boost growth. What is 
crucial here is not only the production of digital goods, but also the diffusion of these products 
in the form of intermediate inputs to other areas.
Overall, the German economy still appears to be in a good position. Thus far, demographic 
change has been counteracted by employing immigrants, amongst other measures. German 
enterprises continue to make great use of the opportunities offered by international markets. All 
in all, industry has been able to mitigate the direct energy price shock fairly well due to its good 
profitability and financing as well as temporary government assistance measures. Despite coming 
under numerous strains, the price and cost competitiveness of the economy remains quite favour -
able on average. Differences between sectors are likely to be considerable, though.
Nevertheless, there is broad- based pressure to take action. The problems that must be overcome 
are complex and, in some cases, intertwined. For example, the supply of energy must be ensured 
and international dependencies need to be reduced. At the same time, in order to achieve climate 
targets, it is likely that substantial imports of storable energy sources and certain raw materials 
will still be needed. For the foreseeable future, transformation processes such as digitalisation 
and decarbonisation will require a large supply of skilled workers, which is diminishing due to 
demographic change. Amidst all of this, the scale and speed of the necessary structural change 
are not easy to gauge.
Central, state and local levels of government can contribute to the attractiveness of Germany as 
a business location by creating suitable framework conditions. These include the ability to plan 
ahead in the area of energy supply, such as through consistent and predictable climate policy. 
Transformative processes such as decarbonisation and digitalisation will be all the more manage -
able if the education system provides students with the right key skills and, above all, the ability 
to adapt to structural change. Greater diversification of suppliers in international trade – for 
example through regional free trade agreements – would reduce the risk of excessive dependen -
cies on China. Improving the integration of immigrants into the labour market as well as increas -
ing the efficiency of government administration and approval processes would likewise make 
Germany more attractive as a business location. Policymakers are currently taking some steps in 
this direction. However, these must also be implemented and pursued.Deutsche Bundesbank

Deindustrialisation 
in Germany?
For some time now, doubts have been raised 
concerning Germany’s “business model” and 
its prospects for the future. The discussion has 
intensified in recent months in light of Russia’s 
war of aggression against Ukraine and other 
geopolitical turmoil. Germany’s business model 
is said to revolve around a relatively strong 
industry- based economy supported by cheap 
Russian gas. By all accounts, the success of for -
eign trade is linked to pronounced supply chain 
dependencies on “problematic” states and the 
persistently high need for skilled workers is met 
through immigration. This orientation of the 
German economy is thought to be unsustain -
able. As a consequence of Russia’s war against 
Ukraine, energy costs rose massively. It is ar -
gued that it will become more difficult to cover 
Germany’s labour shortage through immigra -
tion, partly because demographic change is im -
pacting some neighbouring countries to even 
greater degrees. The stability of cross- border 
supply chains appears to be under threat due 
to the prevailing geopolitical tensions. It is for 
these reasons that Germany’s business model is 
reportedly in danger. Without further – and, in 
some cases, substantial  – economic policy 
intervention, Germany would be at risk of dein -
dustrialisation.
The energy supply, international dependencies 
and demographic change are undoubtedly 
major challenges facing the German economy. 
An assessment of these challenges should 
begin by taking stock of the German econo -
my’s critical dependencies. On this basis, it will 
be easier to evaluate how much action is 
needed. In this context, it must be kept in mind 
that Germany’s business model is not a result 
of government planning and design. The struc -
tures of economies arise from complex market- 
based processes within a government frame -
work. Here, enterprises are constantly adapting 
to a changing market environment, and appro -
priate government framework conditions can 
make this easier.The significance of industry 
to the German economy
Industry has a special status in Germany.1 Last 
year, the manufacturing sector accounted for 
18% of gross domestic product (GDP) and 16% 
of employment; these figures are significantly 
higher than in most other advanced econ -
omies. It is also noteworthy that German indus -
try’s share of value added remained stable from 
the 1990s up until the COVID-  19 pandemic. 
Like in other advanced economies, it saw a 
marked decline during the pandemic. The shift 
in value added and employment towards the 
services sector has been slower than in other 
countries and can be explained, in part, by the 
comparatively high productivity gains in Ger -
man industry.2 Nevertheless, in Germany, as in 
other advanced economies, the largest share of 
value added by far is attributable to the services 
sector, standing at around 60%. A certain con -
vergence in the size of the German industrial 
sector to the proportions seen in other ad -
vanced economies would not be cause for con -
cern, per se, especially if it were to occur grad -
ually.
In aggregate terms, productivity growth in Ger -
many since the 1990s has not been systematic -
ally higher or lower than in economies in which 
the shift towards the services sector progressed 
more rapidly. The digital transformation has 
been one contributing factor in this. Sectors of 
the economy that produce predominantly 
digital goods have recorded above- average 
growth in productivity over recent decades and 
have thus been key drivers of aggregate prod -Germany’s

duction sector are not the main focus here, as they include, 
for example, energy companies, some segments that only 
account for small shares of value added in GDP (such as 
mining) and segments that are oriented towards the do -
mestic economy (such as construction).

uctivity growth.3 Bundesbank analyses show 
that, alongside investment in digital goods, 
digital intermediate inputs that feed into a 
wide variety of goods via production linkages 
were also significant in this context.4 However, 
much like in other advanced economies, the 
effi ciency gains resulting from digitalisation 
have tended to diminish over time.5
Evidence from a survey conducted by the 
Bundesbank in 2022 suggests that digitalisa -
tion has seen a boost in some parts of the cor -
porate sector since the pandemic.6 However, it 
remains to be seen how persistent this boost 
and the associated changes in enterprises’ 
work processes will be. To enhance productiv -
ity growth in the future, it will be crucial to bet -
ter exploit the potential offered by the digital 
transformation. In this context, changes in in -
stitutional conditions to create an efficient 
digital infrastructure could bring about signifi -
cant incentive effects.
The present debate surrounding the state of 
German industry should, however, be viewed 
against the backdrop of the far- reaching, con -
current challenges posed by decarbonisation, 
the demographic transition and changes in the 
international environment. Moreover, if digitali -
sation is to succeed, significant further adjust -
ments need to be made in the corporate sec -
tor. The challenges to industry arising from po -
tentially disruptive changes in these four areas 
cannot be denied.
International linkages of the 
German economy
While some of these developments are only 
recent , most have longer histories. The German 
economy has been confronted with a changing 
global economic environment for some time 
now. Following the global financial and eco -
nomic crisis, world trade lost significant mo -
mentum after having grown strongly for 30 
years. The driving force behind this weakness in 
world trade was not just the slowdown in global economic growth. Besides this, the 
share of world trade in global GDP did not in -
crease further. This is, in part, a reflection of the 
rising significance of emerging market econ -
omies; for these countries, GDP growth was 
less trade- intensive.7 In addition, the tailwinds Sustainable

for trade provided by falling costs for informa -
tion, communication and transport are likely to 
have diminished.8 Furthermore, protectionist 
movements have also slowed down inter -
national trade. These were especially apparent 
in the trade dispute between the United States 
and China. However, tariffs and non- tariff bar -
riers to trade have been on the rise in other 
parts of the world, too. According to the Global 
Trade Alert database, the number of new 
measures worldwide restricting trade has 
reached new highs in recent years.9
In Germany, too, foreign trade linkages de -
veloped more slowly following their recovery from the global financial and economic crisis of 
2008-09.10 In fact, like in other advanced econ -
omies, integration in global value chains de -
clined slightly. Nevertheless, Germany’s degree 
of openness continued to exceed those of 
other major advanced economies in North 
America, Europe, and Asia by far, with the gap 
even widening further in some cases. This 
means that German enterprises have been 
making greater use of the opportunities arising 
on international markets in the recent past. 
This applies to both sales prospects in foreign 
markets as well as opportunities for the pur -
chase of foreign- manufactured goods or for 
offshore production.
Closely intertwined cross-border linkages also 
harbour risks and dependencies, however. This 
was clearly demonstrated by the supply chain 
disruptions resulting from the COVID-  19 pan -
demic and Russia’s war of aggression against 
Ukraine. The geoeconomic tensions between 
China and the West have also highlighted the 
risks arising from those dependencies. A signifi -
cant part of the strong growth in German ex -
ports and an even larger part of the growth in 
imports over the past two decades have been 
attributable to China.
China is an important sales market for individ -
ual categories of goods, especially for motor 
vehicles and machinery. It also plays an import -
ant, but not exceptional, role for the goods ex -
ported by the German economy as whole.11

10 The slowdown in the pace of globalisation played a role 
in this. The sharp rise in the foreign trade ratio in 2022 was 
mainly attributable to the considerable increases in the 
prices of import and export goods.
11 In 2022, around 7% of Germany’s total goods exports 
were destined for China. China was thus the fourth most 
important destination country for German exports.Deutsche Bundesbank

than 3% of German value added depends on 
final demand in China.12
From the perspective of goods imports, how -
ever, China has much greater significance. The 
goods for which China accounts for a large 
proportion of deliveries in terms of value in -
clude certain intermediate inputs (such as bat -
teries and electronic components) as well as 
final products from the capital goods sector 
(computer and telecommunications equip -
ment). In addition, sizeable shares of various 
final products from the consumer goods sector 
(e.g. consumer electronics and electrical house -
hold appliances) come from China. Chinese 
intermediate inputs constitute a significant 
share of imported intermediate inputs, particu -
larly in the production of computer, electronic 
and optical products as well as electrical equip -
ment. Other segments of the manufacturing 
sector, such as construction and machinery, 
also use sizeable shares of intermediate inputs 
from China.
Whilst other imports of raw materials and inter -
mediate inputs from China are low in terms of 
value, they are often difficult to replace with 
imports from other countries.13 According to a 
survey conducted by the Bundesbank, many 
German firms make use of critical intermediate 
inputs from China in their production pro -
cesses; the options for replacing these goods 
are often limited (for more information on de -
pendence on China, see the box on pp. 21f.). 
This applies, in particular, to the manufacturing 
sector. German firms have already taken meas -
ures to reduce their strong focus on China with 
regard to their sourcing of critical intermediate 
inputs. In many cases, however – especially for 
intermediate inputs considered “very difficult” 
to replace – no efforts have yet been made to 
reduce dependencies on China. A sudden break … but is more

with China would likely bring about far-  
reaching disruptions to supply chains and pro -
duction in Germany, at least in the short term.14
According to the stock figures from the foreign 
direct investment statistics collected by the 
Bundesbank, the foreign direct investment 
stock of German enterprises is distributed 
widely around the world. As a location for Ger -
man foreign direct investment, China was in 
third place behind the United States and Lux -
embourg, which is an important holding loca -
tion. All the same, China’s share of German 
foreign direct investment only amounted to 
just under 6% in 2021. By comparison, turn -
over and income from foreign direct invest -
ment in China are high. According to the most 
recent figures, Chinese affiliates of German cor -
porate groups generated turnover of €382 bil -
lion and profits of €23 billion. This means that 
22% of Germany’s global turnover and 15% of 
Germany’s global investment income were 
generated from foreign direct investment in 
China.15
In the past, German corporate groups bene -
fited greatly from internationalisation via for -
eign direct investment and increased their 
international competitiveness in this way.16 Al-
though the level of foreign direct investment in 
China is relatively low at present, China’s share 
in Germany’s total foreign direct investment 
has doubled since 2010. This is a reflection of 
China’s robust and, in global terms, compara -
tively strong growth. China plays a prominent 
role in the automotive sector, in particular, ac -
counting for 29% of German foreign direct in -
vestment. However, China is also a major loca -
tion for investment in the manufacture of ma -

14 This would particularly affect the production of goods 
in which critical intermediate inputs play a role. Over the 
longer term, however, it is likely that part of the intermedi -

The signifi  cance of China as a supplier of critical 
intermediate  inputs to German fi  rms
The past few years have highlighted the 
risks to economic development arising from 
signifi  cant unilateral dependence on inter-
mediate inputs from abroad. The COVID- 19 
pandemic and Russia’s war of aggression 
against Ukraine led to disruptions in supply 
chains. More recently, the geopolitical and 
economic tensions between China and the 
West have made China the focus of eco-
nomic policy discussion. This is because 
there was no other country from which 
German fi  rms imported more in 2022, and 
this included numerous intermediate inputs. 
The dependence on China is not simply ap-
parent from aggregate trade data, as this 
perspective underestimates existing de-
pendencies on the import side. Even inter-
mediate inputs with low shares of value in 
the total intermediate inputs used can be 
essential for production processes and may 
be diffi   cult to source from other countries. 
These include, for example, commodities 
such as rare earths as well as lithium and 
cobalt, for which production and further 
processing is globally dominated by China.1
The assessment of the Bundesbank Online 
Panel – Firms (BOP- F) survey for the months 
of April to June 2023 paints a more detailed 
picture. It also provides information on the 
scope available to German fi  rms for redu-
cing their dependence on intermediate in-
puts sourced from China.
In the period covered by the survey, 29% of 
fi  rms in Germany sourced critical intermedi-
ate inputs from China. “Critical intermedi-
ate inputs” are goods or services without 
which a relevant portion of a fi  rm’s produc-
tion processes or business activities would 
cease or only be possible with considerable 
delays or at greatly reduced standards of quality.2 It is noteworthy that the majority 
of these fi  rms source critical intermediate 
inputs via domestic or foreign intermediar-
ies. Many of the fi  rms that rely on Chinese 
intermediate inputs therefore do not main-
tain direct import relations with China, but 
are nevertheless highly dependent on Chi-
nese intermediate inputs.
According to the BOP- F survey, almost one- 
half of fi  rms in the manufacturing sector 
rely on Chinese intermediate products for 
their production processes.3 Furthermore, 
these fi  rms largely assess the possibilities for 
replacing critical intermediate inputs from 
China with products from other countries 
to be limited. Among the industrial fi  rms 
that are dependent on China, 80% reported 
that it would be “diffi   cult” or “very diffi   cult” 
to source replacement products from other 
countries. According to the survey, fi  rms 
with higher turnover are especially depend-
ent on intermediate inputs from China and 
have little scope for sourcing substitutes. 
Overall, fi  rms that source critical intermedi-
ate inputs from China and consider the pos-
sibilities of sourcing substitutes to be “very 
diffi   cult” generated just under one- quarter 
of the turnover of the German manufactur-
ing sector in 2022.4 In the short to medium 
1 See International Energy Agency (2023).
2 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2023d).
3 This is consistent with a survey conducted by the ifo 
Institute, which found that 46% of fi  rms in the manu-
facturing sector are dependent on critical intermediate 
inputs from China. See Baur and Flach (2022). Accord-
ing to the BOP- F survey, other sectors also source crit-
ical intermediate inputs from China. This applies, in 
particular, to wholesale and retail trade, as well as to 
construction and the information and communication 
services sector.
4 If industrial fi  rms that consider the possibility of re-
placing intermediate inputs from China to be “diffi   cult” 
were also included here, the share of turnover would 
increase to 57%.Deutsche Bundesbank

term, the economic damage caused by an 
abrupt break in trade relations with China 
could thus be considerable.
Among the industrial fi  rms that imported 
critical intermediate inputs from China in 
2022 or 2023, just over two- fi  fths have al-
ready taken measures to reduce their de-
pendence. In this context, these fi  rms are 
mainly turning to imports of intermediate 
inputs from the European Union (18%), but 
some are also sourcing inputs from non- EU 
countries (8%) or domestically (7%). A fur-
ther 16% of these fi  rms are considering 
such measures for the near future.
However, more than two- fi  fths of fi  rms that 
are dependent on China have taken no ac-
tion so far. Within this group, the propor-
tion of fi  rms that consider substituting Chi-
nese intermediate inputs to be “very diffi   -
cult” is remarkably large. Accordingly, redu-
cing dependence on China is still pending in many cases, especially for intermediate 
products considered “very diffi   cult” to re-
place. Although some fi  rms have already 
taken steps towards reducing their depend-
ence on China, it may take some time to 
develop new supply capacities in other re-
gions of the world and to build up new 
supplier relationships.5
5 According to estimates from the International Energy 
Agency, in the past, projects aimed at developing new 
mining capacity for critical minerals took an average of 
16 years from discovery to fi  rst production. See Inter-

manufacture of chemicals and chemical prod -
ucts (8%). In this case, German enterprises pri -
marily use their Chinese affiliates to ensure 
their supplies of critical intermediate inputs or 
to gain access to the Chinese sales market.
In light of the rising geopolitical tensions and 
the risks that these bring, it may make sense 
for enterprises and policymakers to rethink the 
established structure of supply chains and fur -
ther expansion of foreign direct investment in 
China. Above all, this would mean adjusting 
the balance between efficiency and resilience 
to take account of the changed environment. 
Greater diversification of supply sources and 
adjusted inventory management could reduce 
risks.17 Focusing more on resilience can also be 
justified from an efficiency standpoint. This is 
especially true in cases where enterprises, up 
until now, have not taken sufficient consider -
ation of the economic and political risks that 
arise from international value chains.18 Further -
more, current policy initiatives aim to ensure 
that enterprises orient their supply chains more 
strongly toward countries that are systemically 
closer to their own. Other measures, such as 
the US Inflation Reduction Act, even intend to 
relocate production sites to domestic locations, 
at least for strategically important goods. There 
are corresponding plans at the EU level, too, 
such as the European Chips Act, the European 
Critical Raw Materials Act, and the EU- funded 
Important Projects of Common European Inter -
est, which include projects in the area of bat -
tery cell production.19
Direct government intervention in international 
trade should fundamentally be restricted to es -
tablishing the general framework. This is be -
cause restrictions on international trade are 
usually accompanied by welfare losses, which, 
depending on the significance of the trading 
partner in question, can be considerable.20 By 
contrast, regional free trade agreements make 
it easier for enterprises to diversify their trading 
partners.21 In this way, businesses can reduce 
their dependencies on the policies of individual states and thus lower the risk of far- reaching 
disruptions to their supply chains.Diversification of

17 According to business surveys, some firms are examin -
ing ways to make their supply chains more resilient, for 
example by diversifying their sources of supply or by in -
creasing their inventories. See Aksoy et al. (2022) and Ger -
man Chamber of Commerce and Industry (2021).
18 This is the case, for example, if enterprises take account 
only of their own risk and not that of their suppliers, which 
are themselves reliant on other suppliers, or if short- term 
profits are considered more important than medium- term 
resilience due to performance- based remuneration. It is 
also possible that risks are being reassessed based on re -
cent experiences with supply chain disruptions. A partial 
restructuring of value chains could therefore also be justi -
fied from an efficiency standpoint.

Energy cost burden for 
German  enterprises
The second major challenge relates to the 
higher cost of energy. The decrease in Russian 
gas supplies following Russia’s invasion of 
Ukraine as well as the fundamentally high level 
of uncertainty surrounding the supply of en -
ergy have led to large rises in energy prices. In 
Germany, energy prices are likely to remain 
above pre- war levels in the years to come.22 
However, rising energy costs are not only a 
consequence of the war. Measures to limit cli -
mate change may likewise be contributing to 
the higher prices of fossil fuels. This trend could 
become stronger, primarily via rising carbon 
prices, as efforts towards decarbonisation in -
tensify.
Initially, German industry was able to effectively 
cushion the energy price shock due to its fa -
vourable profitability and financing.23 Accord -
ing to Bundesbank simulation results based on 
extrapolated corporate data for various seg -
ments of the manufacturing sector, the direct 
corporate profitability losses were quite man -
ageable.24 The temporary government support 
measures introduced since the start of Russia’s 
war of aggression against Ukraine were a con -
tributing factor here. Nevertheless, there were 
more significant impairments in the particularly energy- intensive segments of the manufactur -
ing sector.25
Despite the temporary sharp rise in energy 
prices compared with major partner countries, 
Germany’s price and cost competitiveness, as 
measured by its long- term average, has re -
mained quite favourable in recent years. For a 
time, this was attributable largely to the depre -
ciation of the euro against the US dollar up 
until September 2022.26 However, in sectors Increased

25 According to the Bundesbank Online Panel – Firms 
(BOP- F) survey conducted in the first quarter of 2023, the 
share of energy costs in total production costs in the manu -
facturing sector in 2022 was, on average, less than 10%; 
for the median manufacturing firm, this share was 5%. 
However, some enterprises in the manufacturing sector are 
very energy- intensive. For the enterprises among the top 
5% of enterprises with the highest shares of energy costs, 
this share was 30% or more. In this regard, output in the 
energy- intensive industry segments dropped by around 
17% between February 2022 and July 2023, according to 
the latest data available. By contrast, overall industrial out -
put declined only by around 3% over the same period; it 
remained almost unchanged if the energy- intensive indus -
try segments are factored out of the calculation.
26 Alongside the nominal effective exchange rate, the indi -
cator for price and cost competitiveness also factors in the 
deflators of total domestic sales as well as a weighted aver -
age of the relevant trading partners.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
September 2023  
24

with greatly above- average shares of energy 
costs, the burdens imposed by higher energy 
prices are likely to be much more significant. 
These include the chemical industry, the paper 
industry, the production of basic metals, and 
the glass and ceramics industry. Higher energy 
prices in Germany than those abroad could 
cause price competitiveness to deteriorate in 
the future due to weaker productivity growth 
and, in some cases, higher sales prices.
According to a survey conducted by the 
Bundesbank, German enterprises –  including 
those in industry – have already taken meas -
ures to adjust to higher energy prices (see the 
box on measures against higher energy prices 
on pp. 26 ff.). On the one hand, these include 
short- term adjustments such as saving energy 
or passing on costs to customers. On the other 
hand, they are planning to increase their en -
ergy efficiency or make greater use of renew -
able energy. Relocations of production abroad 
have so far been rather rare, even in the manu -
facturing sector and its energy- intensive seg -
ments. In addition, the turnover share of the 
enterprises planning to relocate abroad has so 
far been rather small. According to the survey, 
there are no signs of broad- based deindustriali -
sation in Germany.27
Nevertheless, the surge in energy prices is ham -
pering the medium- term growth potential of 
the German economy, according to Bundes -
bank estimates.28 Based on these estimates, 
persistently higher energy prices will lead to 
losses in potential output, as enterprises – in 
the case of imperfect substitutes – tend to curb 
their energy use and their production. The 
supply- side effects of higher energy prices are 
likely to be significantly stronger than those of 
the COVID-  19 pandemic.29Energy supply during the 
transition to a low- emission 
economy
Climate change mitigation is one of the largest 
challenges facing society today. The transition 
to a less carbon- intensive economy may place 
considerable burdens on enterprises, including 
costs arising as a result of emissions pricing, in -
creased prices for emissions- intensive inter -
mediate inputs, outlays to avoid emissions and 
losses from asset repricing. The economic con -
sequences for enterprises are likely to depend 
heavily on the nature and design of the inter -
ventions as well as the characteristics of the 
sector, such as emission intensity,30 which is 
typically relatively high in energy- intensive in -
dustries and also in the energy production sec -
tor itself.
Germany’s energy supply remains heavily de -
pendent on fossil fuels, which are largely im -
ported.31 Its liquefied natural gas terminals, 
both those that have been operating since 
2022 and those that are scheduled for the next 
few years, only reduce supply risk for natural 
gas. Further steps are needed to reduce the 
country’s dependence on imported fossil en -
ergy. These are in line with Germany’s neces -
sary efforts to achieve its declared climate tar -
gets (reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 
at least 65% by 2030 compared with 1990 Adjustment to

27 In the manufacturing sector, employment subject to so -
cial security contributions has recovered only minimally 
since the end of 2021 following the adjustments made 
during the pandemic. However, there has been no indica -
tion of a reduction in employment in industry since the 
sharp rises in energy prices up to mid- 2023. Disaggregated 
sectoral data on employment subject to social security con -
tributions in the energy- intensive industry segments are 
available only for the period up to the end of 2022. These 
data likewise do not show any signs of structural shifts in 
employment. The same applies to gross value added in the 
manufacturing sector, which even grew slightly compared 
to its level at the end of 2021.

Measures introduced or planned by German enterprises in 
response to rising energy costs
The sharp rises in energy prices since 2021 
have had a severe impact on the German 
economy, especially last year. The fact that 
German enterprises were, on average, in 
favour able fi  nancial positions helped to 
mitigate the direct impact on their profi  t-
ability and fi  nancing.1 In future, however, 
how they fare will increasingly depend on 
how they adapt to the changed conditions 
regarding the supply and costs of energy. It 
will also hinge on the extent to which rising 
energy prices weaken growth potential, 
particularly in the manufacturing sector. 
An  evaluation of the Bundesbank Online 
Panel – Firms (BOP- F) survey from the fi  rst 
quarter of 2023 provides detailed informa-
tion on the measures that German enter-
prises either have recently implemented or 
are planning for the future. This information 
is not included in conventional statistics.
In 2022, an especially large number of en-
terprises responded to rising energy costs 
by saving energy, for example on heating, 
lighting or hot water consumption. In add-
ition, when weighted by fi  rm turnover, 
more than half of the enterprises raised the 
prices for their products and services in 
2022. In doing so, many businesses passed 
on their higher energy costs –  at least in 
part – to their customers.2 Enterprises also 
took longer- term measures aimed at im-
proving their energy effi   ciency or increasing 
their use of renewable energy. In turnover- 
weighted terms, one- third of enterprises in-
vested in energy effi   ciency in 2022, com-
pared with just one- fi  fth in 2021.3 In 2022, 
a further one- quarter of fi  rms were also 
planning to make this type of investment in 
the near future. Together with the energy 
savings, this is consistent with data indicat-
ing that growth in the energy productivity of the German economy almost tripled last 
year compared with the average of previous 
years.4
By contrast, production cuts and relocations 
of production abroad were relatively rare 
overall in 2022. Just over 6% of enterprises 
–  measured in terms of their turnover  – 
scaled back their production in 2022 owing 
to high energy costs. Less than 3% of turn-
over was attributable to the enterprises that 
moved parts of their production abroad. 
However, relocations of production could 
continue to some extent in the future. This 
can be explained by the fact that enter-
prises accounting for a total share of around 
4% of turnover have been planning to 
move parts of their production abroad in 
the near future due to increased energy 
costs. This is also consistent with the fact 
that, given the rise in energy costs so far, 
4% of fi  rms – weighted by turnover – have 
been planning to step up their imports of 
energy- intensive products. Such projects 
could render parts of domestic production 
obsolete.
1 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2023c).
2 An economic survey conducted by the German 
Chamber of Industry and Commerce in the autumn of 
2022 suggests that just under 60% of enterprises 
passed on high energy prices to their customers. See 
German Chamber of Industry and Commerce (2022).
3 Investments in energy effi   ciency are aimed at redu-
cing energy consumption in existing buildings (e.g. en-
ergy insulation, replacement of windows, installation 
of a ventilation system) or in technical installations 
(e.g. purchase of smart meters, energy- effi   cient IT sys-

4 According to data from the Working Group on En-
ergy Balances, primary energy productivity growth 
(real GDP per gigajoule of energy used), adjusted for 
temperature effects, almost tripled last year compared 
with the average for the years 2011 to 2021. This was 
the highest growth rate in one year since 1991. See

The rise in energy prices has had the hard-
est impact on the manufacturing sector, as 
this area has the highest primary energy 
and gas consumption within the corporate 
sector.5 Accordingly, enterprises in industry 
have more frequently undertaken measures 
intended to mitigate the impact of the en-
ergy crisis compared with other sectors 
such as the construction or services sectors. 
Measured in terms of turnover, a signifi  -
cantly larger proportion of enterprises 
switched from natural gas to other fossil 
fuels in 2022 than in 2021. This is hardly 
surprising, however, as the gas consump-
tion of some large fi  rms could probably be 
replaced much more quickly with mineral 
oil or coal, for example, than with renew-
able energy. It is noteworthy that the enter-
prises in the manufacturing sector that ei-
ther had invested or were planning to in-
vest in energy effi   ciency in 2022 accounted 
for around two- thirds of turnover. Accord-
ing to the results of the BOP- F survey, the 
turnover share of the fi  rms that had 
switched or were planning to switch to re-
newable energy was also considerable, at 
60%. Based on these fi  ndings, the adjust-
ment processes in industry to high energy 
costs and away from fossil fuels are already 
clearly discernible.6 Enterprises made com-
paratively seldom use of government sup-
port measures in 2022.7
To date, relocations of production abroad 
have also been rather rare in the hard- hit 
manufacturing sector. Where mention is 
made of such plans, it is primarily by larger 
enterprises. In terms of turnover, the share 
of manufacturing enterprises that in 2022 
either had relocated parts of their produc-
tion abroad or wanted to do so in the near 
future was just over 6%.8 Based on this sur-
vey, the risk posed by relocations of produc-
tion abroad resulting from higher energy 
prices seems so far to be limited for Ger-
man industry as a whole. This also holds true for energy- intensive enterprises.9 In 
2022, of the energy- intensive enterprises in 
the manufacturing sector, around 20% had

6 The survey does not provide any information on the 
scale of investment, however.
7 Large enterprises with signifi  cant natural gas con-
sumption made most use of the support measures. 
However, owing to the price brakes introduced at the 
start of 2023 and the extension of existing relief meas-
ures, the share of enterprises that have made or will 
make use of government support measures recently 
saw marked growth.

scale of production relocations.

of energy costs in total production costs. Enterprises 
with a share of over 10% are classifi  ed as energy- 
intensive.Measures implemented or planned by

levels, greenhouse gas neutrality by 2045). The 
expansion of domestic energy production 
through low- emission renewable energy 
sources is one step along this path. Others in -
clude a reduction in energy consumption and 
an increase in energy efficiency. According to 
various studies modelling transitional paths to 
achieving these climate targets, Germany 
would still ultimately need to import energy (in 
this case from non- fossil energy sources) in 
order to meet its energy needs. However, the 
net import volume would be smaller than be -
fore the transition.32
However, energy is likely to remain a scarce 
commodity on the path to transition, as de -
mand for electricity, in particular, would rise 
sharply and requires a huge expansion of pro -
duction capacity. This would also entail an ex -
tensive need for technologies such as storage 
and power grids to reconcile renewable energy 
production and energy needs.33 This is one of 
the reasons why the shift towards low- emission energy supply requires high additional invest -
ment in the aggregate capital stock over a 
longer period of time.34
The expansion of domestic energy production 
from renewable energy sources could be accel -
erated in Germany by improving framework 
Energy transition 
requires strong 
expansion of 
electricity supply 
and additional 
technologiescut their production and 11% were plan-
ning to do so in the near future (in each 
case measured in terms of turnover).10 In 
this case as well, though, the turnover share 
of those enterprises that in 2022 either had 
relocated parts of their production abroad 
or were planning to do so was quite small, 
at just under 6%.
10 These data are subject to particular uncertainty 
owing to the smaller sample size used.

Economics at the University of Cologne (2021), Fraunhofer 
Institute for Solar Energy Systems (2021), Prognos et al. 
(2021) and Stolten et al. (2021).
33 Furthermore, the 65% reduction in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030 compared with 1990 levels appears am -
bitious, as the annual reduction in the remaining period 
would have to be just over twice as large as the average of 
the past 32 years.
34 See KfW Research (2021). Moreover, it is likely that 
there will be additional adjustment costs related to the im -
pact of ongoing climate change. The effects of climate 
change mitigation investment on the aggregate capital 
stock are a priori unclear, as additional investment is offset 
by increased depreciation. Hence, existing fixed assets that 
would not have reached the end of their useful lives with -
out decarbonisation investment would need to be re -
placed. It is difficult to quantify the additional depreciation, 
as this requires a detailed analysis of the capital replace -
ment needed to decarbonise the economy in the various 
areas of the capital stock. See Joint Economic Forecast Pro -

conditions. Greater incentives to use renewable 
energy could arise from the inclusion of all sec -
tors in the EU emissions trading system.35 A 
comprehensive emissions trading scheme of 
this kind would harmonise the costs of CO₂ 
emissions and would provide a transparent 
safeguard for existing climate targets. EU emis -
sions trading has so far covered the energy and 
energy- intensive industry segments.36 The 
European Union’s plans to create an additional 
trading system covering buildings and transport 
are a step in the right direction.37 For reasons 
of efficiency, however, it seems sensible to aim 
for a uniform system in the long term, setting a 
single carbon price for all sectors.38 Consistent 
and reliable climate policy provides enterprises 
with the planning certainty needed for invest -
ment and reduces the macroeconomic costs of 
climate policy.39
Other approaches to accelerating the energy 
transition include tailored land use plans, con -
siderably simplified approval processes and 
faster judicial review procedures for the expan -
sion of production facilities and networks. In 
addition, it would be very important to pro -
mote research and development – especially 
with a view to ensuring a cost-  effective bal -
ance between foreseeable strong fluctuations 
in supply and demand, for example for energy 
storage.
Energy- intensive industries, in particular, need 
time to adapt to higher energy prices, whether 
temporary or otherwise. The proposed indus -
trial electricity price cap is intended to contrib -
ute to this. Overall, however, there is a risk that 
such subsidies will slow down structural 
change, weakening incentives to avoid emis -
sions by also promoting electricity generated 
using fossil fuels.40 It therefore seems more ef -
fective to use the available funds to improve 
the framework conditions for the expansion of 
renewable energy, including network infra -
structure.41Better govern -

35 The faster reduction in the number of emission permits 
issued free of charge would also contribute here. This 
would also require earlier implementation of the Carbon 
Border Adjustment Mechanism.
36 EU emissions trading currently covers just under 40% of 
total EU greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to the en -
ergy and energy- intensive industry segments, intra-  
European aviation is also included in the existing emissions 
trading system. These sectors account for around 5% of 
aggregate gross value added. Shipping is also to be in -
cluded from 2024.
37 The European Union intends to create an additional, 
independent emissions trading system for the buildings 
and road transport sectors and other industrial sectors 
from 2027 onwards.
38 The European Commission intends to assess by 31 Oc -
tober 2031 whether the integration of the two trading sys -
tems should be pursued.
39 According to the Bundesbank’s scenario calculations 
using the environmental multi- sector DSGE model EMuSe, 
the costs of a disorderly climate policy are higher than 
those of an orderly one; see Deutsche Bundesbank (2022c). 
Strict carbon pricing is implemented at an early stage in an 
orderly climate policy and the degree of intervention is 
gradually tightened, whereas disorderly climate policy is as -
sumed to intervene noticeably later but commensurately 
more strongly.
40 See Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research 
(2023a).
41 On this topic, the European Commission recently pre -
sented a proposal to reform the design of the EU electricity 
market. The aim is to accelerate the expansion of renew -
able energy in Europe by increasing the use of long- term 
electricity contracts and other measures, whilst at the same 
time promoting European industry through more stable 
electricity prices. See European Commission (2023b).Deutsche Bundesbank

Demographic change
Demographic change is another major chal -
lenge facing the German economy, reducing 
labour supply and increasing competition for 
skilled workers. From the second half of the 
2020s onwards, the working age population 
will decline. This demographic process started 
among the domestic population some time 
ago, but was offset by immigration. As baby 
boomers reach retirement age over the next 15 
years, even immigration is unlikely to offset this 
effect. A more significant factor in the reduc -
tion in labour supply is the effect of changes in the age structure. The higher share of older 
workers alone will cause the participation rate 
of 15 to 74- year- olds in Germany to fall in a 
few years’ time, even if the participation rate 
continues to increase in individual age groups. 
The share of prime age workers, the group in 
which the participation rate is highest, is dwin -
dling. This age structure effect is also likely to 
dampen average working hours, as older per -
sons have a higher preference for part-  time 
work.
The decline in labour supply will also dampen 
fixed capital formation in the future, as fewer 
workers will need to be provided with capital.42 
Productivity developments may also be damp -
ened by the increasing pace of population age -
ing. There is evidence that individual labour 
productivity tends to decline among elderly 
employees and that ageing reduces the cap -
acity to innovate and adapt to new technolo -
gies.43 In addition, resources will tend to be 
increasingly diverted to areas of below- average 
productivity, such as services for the support 
and care of older generations. This resource 
channelling means that the demographic de -
cline in labour supply will dampen the German 
economy’s potential output in the medium 
term.
The above dampening effects on potential out -
put are the result of the status quo of the eco -
nomic policy framework. However, the strength 
of these demographic developments can be 
mitigated by an increased influx of skilled work -
ers from outside Germany. Third countries de -
serve greater attention here, as, owing to simi -
lar demographic developments, economic mi -
gration from other EU countries will no longer 
be able to play the dominant role it has as -
sumed over the past decade. The various initia -
tives taken by the Federal Government in this Demographic

area are steps in the right direction.44 Immi -
grants outside the influx of skilled workers 
should also be quickly integrated into the la -
bour market if they have long-  term prospects 
of remaining in Germany.
In order to increase labour force participation 
and working hours beyond the expected trend, 
the institutional framework needs to be ad -
justed in two main ways. First, the participation 
rate of women, in particular, could increase if 
there were better childcare facilities for children 
(and possibly for those in need of long- term 
care) and if the tax and social contributions sys -
tem provided greater incentives for second 
earners to work.45 Second, in order to prolong 
working life as life expectancy increases, it 
seems appropriate to tie the statutory retire -
ment age to life expectancy. This would not 
only bolster economic strength, but would also 
ensure that social contribution and tax rates do 
not need to rise as sharply.46
Enterprises can also set incentives themselves, 
for example through more flexible working 
time models. In addition to incentives for in -
vestment, skilled labour is needed to ensure 
that any transformation is successful and prod -
uctivity potential can be tapped. This will re -
quire better digital skills training, not only for 
employees but also in the education system.
Summary and economic 
policy  conclusions
The challenges facing the German economy 
are complex and often intertwined. Demo -
graphic change is weighing on growth pro -
spects and exacerbating competition for skilled 
workers, who are also needed to make the en -
ergy transition and the digital transformation a 
reality. In foreign trade, there are considerable 
dependencies on China. A sudden break with 
China would likely cause far- reaching disrup -
tions to supply chains and production in Ger -
many, at least in the short term. It would also 
curb progress in the transition to renewable en -ergy that is necessary to achieve climate tar -
gets, as this progress is partly dependent on 
technology components from China. In the 
medium and long term, it is important to cre -
ate the conditions for ensuring that the low-  
emission energy supply remains reliable and 
that energy costs remain affordable. This will 
necessitate an increase in the supply of renew -
able energy and a reduction in energy demand. 
Given all of this, it is difficult to gauge the ex -
tent of both the required and the expected 
structural changes.
So far, the German economy has been in large 
part well positioned. German enterprises con -
tinue to make great use of the opportunities 
offered by international markets. With regard 
to the energy crisis, German enterprises appear 
to have mitigated the immediate effects well 
on average owing to their good profitability 
and financing alongside government assis -
tance. Enterprises have also already taken steps 
to adjust in the face of higher energy prices. 
The price and cost competitiveness of the Ger -
man economy remains favourable on average. 
It also has a well- trained workforce, infrastruc -
ture that remains sound, wage bargainers 
seeking consensus and comparatively stable 
underlying conditions. However, international 
competitiveness rankings point to the need for 
action.47 The largest need to catch up is likely Increase in

out of 141 countries); see Schwab (2019). For an up- to- 
date ranking, see, inter alia, International Institute for Man -
agement Development (2023). This ranking shows a more 
unfavourable picture and further deterioration: Germany 
now ranks 22nd out of 64 countries (a drop of seven

to be in the arena of digitalisation.48 This could 
provide a significant boost to growth.49
It is the government’s task to support structural 
change with reliable framework conditions. 
Policymakers could improve conditions in Ger -
many as a business location in a number of 
areas that fall under government remit.50 Reli-
able and consistent energy and climate policy is 
essential for sufficiently mobilising private in -
vestment to finance the path to transition. The 
pricing of greenhouse gas emissions via certifi -
cate trading is an efficient tool for this purpose. 
In addition, Germany would need to simplify 
and speed up planning and approval processes. 
This would also include making the administra -
tion and performance of government tasks 
more efficient in general. Digitalisation should 
contribute significantly to this. The government 
could support enterprises’ digitalisation efforts, 
for example, by promoting digital skills more 
strongly in schools and digitalising administra -
tive processes.51
If the statutory retirement age were linked to 
developments in the life expectancy of older 
people, this could support labour force partici -
pation in the face of demographic change. 
Later retirement would allow labour force po -
tential to be exploited more strongly. Further -
more, a school education providing the requis -
ite skills would need to be ensured and immi -
grants would need to be better supported in 
terms of integration into the labour market. 
There is also a need for a tax and social contri -
butions system that provides performance and 
employment incentives, can withstand demo -
graphic change and ensures a politically ac -
ceptable distribution of wealth. Furthermore, it 
is important to future- proof Germany’s trans -
port infrastructure. It would be off the mark for 
the government to give the impression it would 
provide a broad economic safety net to protect 
against any macroeconomic slowdown or 
problems in the corporate sector.Finally, sound government finances do not 
hamper economic development – they are in 
fact an important prerequisite for it. This ap -
plies to Germany and the euro area. Effective 
fiscal rules ensure sound government finances. 
They do not imply that important political pro -
jects should be neglected. They do, however, 
force priorities to be set. This means that add -
itional needs would have to be financed dir -
ectly through lower expenditure or additional 
revenue elsewhere. Fiscal rules have recently 
been interpreted very broadly by central and 
state governments. It is important to be able to 
rely on credible and binding fiscal rules again in 
the future. At present, the debt brake is making 
the borrowing framework relatively restrictive. 
A reform that moderately raised the regular 
limits of the debt brake and simultaneously in -
creased its binding force would therefore also 
be justifiable in the interests of stable govern -
ment finances. The Bundesbank has made pro -
posals for a stability- oriented reform.52 For ex -
ample, the scope for deficits could be extended 
if the debt ratio is below 60%. If investments 
were to be prioritised within the limits, leeway 
could be reserved for net investment.
In view of the improvement to government 
framework conditions, the ten- point plan pre -
sented by the Federal Government at the Cab -
inet meeting in Meseberg in August 2023 de -
serves support. It addresses important struc -
tural problems and weaknesses, but is not yet 
sufficient to truly address the challenges. Suc -
cess will also depend on how the plan is imple -
mented and pursued.Government

Heterogeneous impact of monetary policy 
in the euro area?
The Eurosystem has a mandate to maintain price stability within the euro area. When making its 
decisions, the Governing Council of the ECB therefore looks at the inflation outlook for the euro 
area as a whole. To determine the monetary policy stance, the Governing Council must also 
evaluate the strength of monetary policy transmission. Disaggregated – i.e. also country- specific 
– data and analyses help to clarify and assess inflation developments and transmission mechan -
isms and are therefore an important factor in monetary policy decision- making.
Monetary policy transmission channels are also influenced by the structural characteristics of the 
euro area economies. Since these differ, in some cases significantly, the Eurosystem’s single mon -
etary policy can be assumed to have varying impacts across the Member States. There are indeed 
a number of empirical studies for the euro area that point to such differences. Studies also find 
evidence of regional differences in the impact of monetary policy for the United States.
This article presents the results of various empirical studies on possible differences in the impact 
of monetary policy on real gross domestic product (GDP) and consumer prices in the four major 
euro area countries (France, Germany, Italy and Spain). The effects of different monetary policy 
instruments are empirically examined. We find that the impact of changes in monetary policy 
rates on real GDP is stronger in Germany and weaker in Spain. This may be due to the more 
prominent role of interest rate- sensitive sectors in Germany, more flexible employment, greater 
export orientation and stronger competition in the banking system. By contrast, the price level 
response is strongest in Spain and weakest in Germany.
Alongside classic interest rate policy, the last few years have seen a number of unconventional 
monetary policy measures being taken, such as forward guidance – in other words, communica -
tion by monetary policymakers about the likely future path of their policy rates. The results for this 
instrument indicate that monetary policy has a stronger impact on both real GDP and consumer 
prices in Germany than in the other large euro area countries. The results of another study sug -
gest that the impact of the government bond purchase programme also varied between the four 
major euro area countries. However, it is still too early to draw a conclusive, coherent picture of 
the relative strength of the effects of the different monetary policy instruments on the euro area 
countries under review from the available studies.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
The Eurosystem has responded to the high in -
flation of the past few years first and foremost 
by raising its policy rates sharply, with these 
hikes taking place at a scale and speed unpre -
cedented in the history of the euro area. 
Through various channels, these measures in -
fluence expectations, financial variables, aggre -
gate demand, production, and ultimately infla -
tion. Empirical analyses of this transmission 
process typically look at the impact of monet -
ary policy on the euro area as a whole.
The aggregate, euro area- wide effects consist 
of the impact that monetary policy has on the 
individual Member States. Because there are 
– in some cases, significant – structural differ -
ences between the economies, monetary pol -
icy cannot be expected to have the same im -
pact in all euro area countries.1 These differ -
ences include, for example, the relative size of 
the various economic sectors and branches of 
activity, the degree of openness of the econ -
omy, the intensity of competition in various 
economic sectors, firms’ funding structure, the 
labour market and its institutions, the structure 
of the financial sector, government activity, the 
tax and social system, and the wealth and 
wealth structure of households (e.g. the im -
portance of residential property or shares). 
How large these differences are affects the 
strength, relative importance and temporal pat -
tern of the transmission of the single monetary 
policy, which is geared toward the euro area as 
a whole, to the various euro area economies. 
As a result, the strength of the responses in the 
variables at the end of the causal chains, i.e. 
real gross domestic product and inflation, may 
differ in the individual euro area Member 
States.
This raises the question as to whether such het -
erogeneous monetary policy effects do actually 
exist in the euro area or in other major currency 
areas. Empirical studies for the United States 
find evidence of regional differences in the im -
pact of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy (Carlino and DeFina (1998, 1999); Owyang and 
Wall (2009); Pizzuto (2020)). There are already 
a number of empirical studies for the euro area, 
too, that point to the existence of country-  
specific differences. This article summarises the 
results of two new analyses on the subject of 
potential differences in the impact of the Euro -
system’s monetary policy in the four major 
euro area countries of France, Germany, Italy 
and Spain, and examines the results in the con -
text of the evidence already available from 
other studies. Both analyses use an approach 
that allows statistically rigorous statements to 
be made about the cross- country differences in 
monetary policy that are of interest here.2 Ul-
timately, this also allows the importance of 
country- specific transmission analyses for the 
Eurosystem to be discussed.

A number of empirical studies have been car -

the effects of monetary policy within or be -
tween countries in a monetary union, most of 
which focus on the effects of the central bank’s 
interest rate policy.3

change.4 The strength and relative importance 
of the various transmission mechanisms are 
likely to depend on the structural features of 
the different economies, thus leading to differ -
ences in the impact of monetary policy across 
the euro area economies. For instance, if com -
petition in the banking system becomes more 
intense, bank interest rates respond more 
strongly to changes in market interest rates in -
fluenced by monetary policy (see, for example, 
van Leuvensteijn et al. (2008)). The strength of 
monetary policy transmission via asset prices, 
such as those for shares or real estate, is influ -
enced, amongst other things, by the distribu -
tion of share ownership and residential prop -
erty. The strength of the exchange rate channel 
should increase with the degree of openness of 
the economy – in other words, the importance 
of exports and imports. How strongly changes 
in nominal demand for goods and services 
caused by monetary policy are reflected in 
changes in real output also depends on the 
structure of the labour market. If real wages become more rigid, output and employment 
should react more strongly to changes in nom -
inal demand (see, for example, Abbritti and 
Weber (2010)). The extent to which output and 
inflation change in relation to one another as a 
result of monetary policy impulses depends 
largely on the slope of the Phillips curve, which 
also reflects structural characteristics of the 
economies.5
Most analyses of potential country or region-  
specific differences in transmission use vector 
autoregressive (VAR) models for their estima -
tions. These models look at dynamic relation -
ships between multiple variables.6 To estimate 
the impact of monetary policy, it is necessary to Widespread use

isolate the causal relationship between changes 
in monetary policy instruments, such as policy 
rates, and changes in the other variables. This is 
complicated by the fact that monetary policy, 
in turn, responds to changes in the other vari -
ables. Analyses using VAR models provide a 
number of approaches to solving this identifi -
cation problem.7 The analyses presented in the 
following sections use VAR models in which 
monetary policy impulses are identified by 
means of sign restrictions, i.e. by making as -
sumptions about the direction in which a mon -
etary policy impulse influences the other vari -
ables in the model (see the annex on pp. 54 ff.).
A number of studies for the euro area were 
conducted around the time it was created or in 
the first few years thereafter. These analyses 
were forced to rely, either to a large extent or 
entirely, on data from the period before the 
euro was launched. Only analyses carried out 
later on were able to rely exclusively on data 
from the period after the euro area was estab -
lished.8 The problem with using data from the 
period prior to monetary union is that any 
country- specific differences in the effects of 
monetary policy may also stem from differ -
ences in the behaviour of the individual na -
tional central banks.9 The studies presented 
below only use data from 1999 onwards, 
meaning that any differences in the behaviour 
of the various central banks prior to the start of 
monetary union are irrelevant.
In addition to studies on country- specific ef -
fects of interest rate policy – i.e. conventional 
central bank monetary policy – there are also 
analyses of the different effects of unconven -
tional monetary policy (see the sections on 
pp. 47 ff. and 51ff.). For the euro area, these 
studies focus in part on the effects of uncon -
ventional monetary policy in general (e.g. 
Boeckx et al. (2017) or Burriel and Galesi 
(2018)), or on specific unconventional monet -
ary policy measures such as the asset purchase 
programme (e.g. Wieladek and Pascual (2016)).Heterogeneous impact of 
interest rate policy?
In the current interest rate hike cycle, policy 
rates are once again the Eurosystem’s primary 
instrument. This raises the question of whether 
policy rate changes have a different impact on 
the individual euro area economies. The study 
by Mandler et al. (2022) makes a contribution 
to this debate. It analyses the differences in the 
impact of the Eurosystem’s interest rate policy 
between France, Germany, Italy and Spain 
using an empirical multi- country model. This is 
based on a Bayesian vector autoregressive 
(BVAR) model which captures the interactions 
between all the variables contained in the 
model for the various countries (see the annex 
on pp. 54 ff.). Including all the countries under 
review in a single model allows a statistically 
rigorous analysis of potential differences in the 
impact of monetary policy (see the box on 
pp. 44 ff.).
The charts on pp. 42 ff. show the main results 
of this analysis. They present in graphic form 
the estimated statistical distributions of cross-  
country differences in the responses of real 
GDP and the Harmonised Index of Consumer 
Prices (HICP) to an interest rate increase of 25 
basis points (bp). These distributions are calcu -
lated from the difference between the esti -
mated impact of monetary policy on the vari -
able in question in the first country minus the 
impact in the second.10 As the model is sym -

8 Examples include Cavallo and Ribba (2015), Ciccarelli et 
al. (2013) and Georgiadis (2015).
9 This problem is discussed in Guiso et al. (2000). Using 
data from before monetary union therefore means that 
monetary policy has to be modelled very carefully in order 
to control for the effects of possible differences in the 
monetary policy reaction function. Examples include Mojon 
and Peersman (2001) as well as Ciccarelli and Rebucci 
(2006).
10 Since real GDP and the HICP are fed into the estimation 
in log levels, the effects of monetary policy should be inter -
preted as percentage deviations of the variables from their 
long- term equilibrium. The charts therefore show the dif -
ference in these percentage deviations between the two 
countries.Deutsche Bundesbank

reductions, the statements also hold for an 
interest rate reduction if the sign is reversed. 
The individual charts show these differences for 
different time horizons following the restrictive 
monetary policy stimulus for all six possible 
combinations of the four countries. The esti -
mated probability distribution for a pair of 
countries compared with the zero line can be 
used to conclude whether and in what direc -
tion the effect of the interest rate change dif -
fers between the two countries. If the distribu -
tion is relatively symmetrical around zero, there 
is no clear indication of a difference in the ef -
fects of monetary policy. If the distribution of 
the difference is largely negative, an interest 
rate increase has a (mathematically) smaller ef -
fect on the variable in the first country than in 
the second. In this case, this means there is a 
stronger negative effect in the first country 
than in the second.11 For ease of interpretation, 
each chart shows selected percentiles of the 
estimated probability distribution of the differ -
ence between the countries.12 For more details, 
see the box on pp. 44 ff.
The first three panels of the chart show that the 
cross- country differences with Germany as the 
first country are predominantly negative for 
time horizons of up to four quarters. Moreover, 
for a period of up to around six quarters, the 
probability of a negative difference is much 
higher than that of a positive one. All in all, 
these results therefore indicate that real GDP 
declines more sharply in Germany after an inter -
est rate hike than in the other three countries.
The outcome of the comparison among the 
three other countries depends on the time 
horizon. The results for France and Italy relative 
to Spain in the last two charts point to a short- 
term negative difference, i.e. a stronger decline 
in real GDP in the first quarters in France and 
Italy than in Spain. After that, however, no fur -
ther systematic differences can be identified.13 
Overall, the estimate suggests that monetary 
policy has a stronger short to medium- term im -
pact on real GDP in Germany than in the other 
countries under review, whilst its impact on real GDP in Spain is the weakest in the short 
term.14
The first three sections of the charts for the 
HICP show a predominantly positive difference 
between Germany and the other countries. The 
positive difference is due to the fact that a 
stronger negative response in the other coun -
try is subtracted from the negative response of 
the HICP in Germany.15 This means that the de -
cline in the price level in Germany following an 
interest rate increase is not as pronounced as in 
the other countries. The last two charts show -
ing the differences between France and Spain 
and between Italy and Spain point to a stronger 
decline in the HICP in Spain in the short term 
compared with Italy and France.16 Overall, the 
results for consumer prices suggest that the 
strongest response to monetary policy takes 
place in Spain and the weakest response in 
Germany.17
Taken together, the results suggest that the 
order of the countries is reversed when it 
comes to the strength of the impact of interest 
rate policy on consumer prices rather than real In a cross- 
country com -
parison, real 
GDP in Germany 
responds more 
strongly to 
changes in 
interest  rates, …… but consumer 
prices respond 
more weakly
11 The identification assumptions used in the model ensure 
that real GDP and the HICP only show a negative response 
in the impact period of the interest rate increase. The pos -
terior distribution of the response of GDP to the interest 
rate increase also shows a mass above the zero line in the 
individual countries in later periods, meaning that a subse -
quent positive response of output to an interest rate in -
crease cannot be ruled out. A negative difference in the 
chart therefore means, strictly speaking, that the response 
of output or the HICP in the first country is smaller, i.e. 
more strongly negative or more weakly positive, than in the 
second.
12 The percentile of order p of a probability distribution of 
a variable x is the characteristic value xp that is not ex -
ceeded by the share p of all realisations, i.e. where F(x) is 
the cumulative distribution function, F(xp) = p.
13 The difference between France and Italy is positive at 
first, and then turns negative. This means that real output 
in France initially declines less after an interest rate in -
crease, but then tends to decline more sharply than in Italy.
14 In the long term, the evidence for these differences dis -
appears as real GDP returns to its long- term steady state, 
while, at the same time, uncertainty bands tend to widen 
as the horizon increases.
15 See also the comments in footnote 11.
16 Similarly to the GDP response, France and Italy switch 
places after just a few quarters compared with the previous 
period.
17 The rankings in terms of GDP and price effects are sup -
ported by a number of other tests in Mandler et al. (2022).Deutsche Bundesbank

GDP . This is not necessarily a contradiction in 
terms; instead, it can be interpreted as a cross- 
country difference in the slope of the aggre -
gate supply function, which describes the rela -
tionship between real GDP and the aggregate 
price level. The results suggest that it is flatter 
in Germany than in the other countries con -
sidered here.18
This raises the question as to the reasons be -
hind the differences identified. The literature on 
the regional and country-  specific effects of 
monetary policy examines the importance of 
various structural factors as the cause of differ -
ences in the impact of monetary policy be -
tween economies. These factors include the 
importance of capital-  intensive sectors or sec -
tors with interest rate- sensitive demand, such 
as the manufacturing sector (see, for example 
Carlino and DeFina (1998, 1999) and Owyang 
and Wall (2009)), the production of durable 
goods or the construction sector (Georgiadis 
(2015)). Differences in the flexibility of the la -
bour market are another potential reason. For 
example, the regression analysis by Georgiadis 
(2015) shows that the strength of the impact of 
monetary policy on real GDP depends signifi -
cantly on labour market institutions and the in -
dustry mix. Other possible explanations include 
differences in the importance of the export sec -
tor, and thus the exchange rate channel, or in 
the intensity of competition in the banking sys -
tem, which in turn may have an impact on 
interest rate pass- through.19
To assess the significance of the various pos -
sible causes, Mandler et al. (2022) combine in -
dicators for the above- mentioned factors and 
review the consistency of the stronger GDP re -
sponse in Germany with the relative position of Possible

18 The results referred to above apply to the relationship 
between output, i.e. real GDP , and the price level. They are 
consistent with the evidence of a relatively flat Phillips 
curve in Germany; see, for example, Ciccarelli and Osbat 
(2017) and Reichold et al. (2022). The Phillips curve de -
scribes the relationship between actual inflation, expected 
inflation and the output gap, i.e. the deviation of output 
from potential.

the country in relation to these indicators.20 It 
turns out that the stronger GDP response in 
Germany to interest rate policy is consistent 
with the greater importance of the manufac -
turing sector and the production of durable 
goods, weaker employment protection, greater 
importance of exports and greater competition 
in the banking system than in the other coun -
tries under consideration.21
The search for what is behind the cross- country 
differences in the price response is a much 
more difficult endeavour. The analysis by Abritti 
and Weber (2010) of the impact of labour mar -
ket institutions on the business cycle shows 
that a stronger response of employment – and 
thus also of output – to a monetary policy im -
pulse is observed in conjunction with a weaker 
response of the inflation rate if the country in 
question exhibits a combination of relatively 
low real wage flexibility and high employment 
flexibility. While the above- mentioned indica -
tors of employment protection legislation for 
Germany provide evidence of a greater degree 
of flexibility in the volume of employment com -

20 Other studies test possible explanatory approaches by 
regressing the trough response of GDP (Georgiadis (2015)) 
or the impulse response functions cumulated over eight 
quarters (Carlino and DeFina (1998, 1999)) on a constant 
and one or more explanatory variables. However, as the 
analysis presented here only provides results for four coun -
tries, it is not possible to perform a similar regression analy -
sis. If a regression were to be carried out on a constant and 
one explanatory variable, only one degree of freedom 
would remain, as the residual variance also needs to be 
estimated. This problem does not apply to the other stud -
ies because they include more regions or countries. In 
these cases, however, the estimation of the model requires 
greater restrictions on the interaction between countries or 
the inclusion of fewer variables per region.
21 However, there are also indicators for structural features 
of the economy whose ranking is inconsistent with the re -
sults of the empirical analysis. This approach can therefore 
only provide rough indications of the potential underlying 
causes.Deutsche Bundesbank

The methodology for comparing monetary policy effects
The studies conducted by Mandler et al. 
(2022) and Mandler and Scharnagl (2023), 
summarised in the main body of this article, 
focus on a cross- country comparison of the 
estimated responses of various macroeco-
nomic variables to monetary policy shocks. 
The dynamic effects of a monetary policy 
shock are typically shown as impulse re-
sponse functions with uncertainty bands 
which provide information on the probabil-
ity distribution of the estimation. Most of 
the studies, based on vector autoregressive 
(VAR) models, examine differences between 
countries or regions by means of a visual 
comparison of these impulse response 
functions. If the probability distributions of 
the impulse response functions for a vari-
able show only very small overlap in two 
countries or regions, the conclusion drawn 
is that there is a difference in the effects of 
monetary policy.1
There are problems associated with this ap-
proach, however. The fi  rst is that it does not 
directly examine the variable of interest 
–  the difference in the impulse response 
functions – but attempts to analyse it indir-
ectly by looking at the distributions of the 
impulse response functions themselves.2 
The second problem is that it treats the two 
estimated impulse response functions to be 
compared as mutually independent. In fact, 
the estimation errors in the impulse re-
sponse functions are likely to be correlated.3 
Third, comparing overlapping uncertainty 
intervals has less favourable statistical prop-
erties than directly testing for a difference.4
Mandler et al. (2022) propose an approach 
for comparing impulse response functions 
between regions which takes into account 
the correlation of the estimation errors and 
focuses directly on the probability distribu-tion of the difference between the impulse 
responses. The approach therefore uses the 
information contained in the joint distribu-
tion rather than indirectly deriving conclu-
sions from the comparison of the distribu-
tions of the two impulse responses. For 
their analysis, they use a multi- country 
model which simultaneously contains all 
countries examined. The correlation be-
tween the estimation errors of the coun-
tries’ impulse response functions is thus 
captured by the model.5 The Bayesian pro-
cedures used to estimate the model use 
stochastic simulations in order to generate 
the model parameters’ probability distribu-
tions. This results in a large number of 
“draws”, each containing a complete set of 
values for the model parameters. The se-
quence of these draws approximates the 
estimated joint distribution of the model 
1 On the other hand, a simple comparison of the point 
estimators of the impulse response functions has only 
limited informational content as it ignores the uncer-
tainty associated with the estimations. The greater the 
estimation uncertainty, the greater the distance be-
tween the point estimators has to be in order to indi-
cate a difference between the countries.
2 The difference between the impulse response func-
tions is a characteristic of the joint distribution of the 
countries’ impulse response functions. However, the 
comparison of the impulse response functions only 
uses information from the marginal distribution or im-
plicitly assumes that the impulse response functions 
are mutually independent. Under this assumption, the 
marginal distributions would contain the same infor-
mation as the joint distribution.
3 Even if the impulse response functions have been 
calculated from separately estimated models for the 
individual countries, the estimation errors may never-
theless be correlated if, in some cases, the same data 
are inputted into the individual models or the data 
content of the models is correlated.
4 See Schenker and Gentleman (2001).
5 This is not the case if the impulse response functions 
are generated from individual, independently esti-
mated models for the various regions. It is not abso-
lutely necessary to use a model such as that described 
here to incorporate the correlation of the estimation 
errors. The approach to comparing impulse response 
functions can also be applied to other approaches for 
multi- country models, such as factor-augmented VAR 
(FAVAR) or panel VAR models.Deutsche Bundesbank

parameters.6 Impulse responses to a mon-
etary policy shock can be calculated for all 
variables from each draw for the model par-
ameters. All of these draws taken together 
thus approximate the joint distribution of 
the impulse response functions of all vari-
ables, and this joint distribution also refl  ects 
the correlation between the various coun-
tries’ impulse responses.
The research question is aimed at possible 
differences between various countries’ im-
pulse response functions. Mandler et al. 
(2022) therefore suggest that, for one spe-
cifi  c variable, such as gross domestic prod-
uct or the Harmonised Index of Consumer 
Prices, the difference between the impulse 
response functions of two countries should 
be calculated from each draw in the estima-
tion. The sequence of draws thus results in 
the probability distribution of the difference 
in the impact of monetary policy on this 
variable between the two countries exam-
ined, from which, as is shown in the main 
text, conclusions about potential hetero-
geneity in the transmission of monetary 
policy can be drawn.
The advantage of this test strategy can be 
illustrated by an example. Assume that two 
countries’ impulse response functions differ 
by a constant but very small amount rela-
tive to the estimation uncertainty of the 
impulse  response functions. Also, let the 
estimation error of the impulse response 
functions in the two countries be perfectly 
positively correlated. In this example, the 
calculation of the differences described 
above results in a constant and non- zero 
value, which clearly indicates a difference in 
the impact of monetary policy. In this ex-
ample, however, the uncertainty bands of 
the impulse response functions overlap al-
most completely, which means that a visual 
comparison of the two does not provide 
any discernible evidence of differences.The basic idea of this approach can be ex-
panded from analysing country- specifi  c dif-
ferences between impulse response func-
tions to cover differences in other variables 
(functions) derived from multi- country 
models, such as shock decompositions, 
forecasts or simulations. In that vein, Man-
dler and Scharnagl (2020) examine differ-
ences between the simulated effects of the 
Eurosystem’s asset purchase programme 
(APP) on the large euro area countries. The 
applicability of the approach also goes be-
yond analyses of heterogeneous effects of 
common (monetary, fi  scal policy or other) 
shocks in a monetary union or regions of a 
country. The approach is generally applic-
able to the question of heterogeneous ef-
fects of a common shock across entities 
such as countries, economic sectors, etc.7
The question of the different effects of vari-
ous shocks on a given variable can be 
examined in a similar manner. The compari-
son of the impact of a conventional monet-
ary policy shock with that of a shock to ex-
pected monetary policy interest rates in 
Mandler and Scharnagl (2023) is one ex-
ample. For this purpose, however, the two 
shocks need to be suitably normalised in 
order to be made comparable.
For greater ease of interpretation, each dia-
gram of the estimated probability distribu-
tion of the country differences on pp. 43 f. 
and pp.  50 f. in the main text shows fi  ve 
percentiles: the 25th, 33rd, 50th (median), 
6 The sequence of draws approximates what is known 
as the posterior distribution of the model parameters. 
This is a combination of the prior distribution, i.e. ex 
ante assumptions about the distribution of the param-
eters, and the likelihood function that contains the 
data’s information on the parameters. For an introduc-
tion to Bayesian estimation approaches, see, e.g., 
Koop (2003) and, for more information on Bayesian 
VAR models, e.g. Kilian and Lütkepohl (2017), chap-
ter 5.

66th and 75th percentile. As an example, 
let us explain the interpretation of the dif-
ferences in the responses of real GDP be-
tween Germany and France and Germany 
and Italy on p. 42.
A comparison of the median and the zero 
line can provide an initial indication: if the 
median is below (above) zero, the probabil-
ity of the actual difference between the 
two countries being negative (positive) is 
greater than the probability of a positive 
(negative) difference. In the quarter in 
which the shock occurs (quarter zero) and 
the subsequent three quarters, the 75th 
percentile is below the zero line for the dif-
ference in the GDP response between Ger-
many and France. What that means is that 
the probability of a negative difference is at 
least three times as large as the probability 
of a positive difference (more than 75% to 
less than 25%). The 66th percentile then is 
near the zero line until around two years 
after the shock, which shows a probability 
ratio of around two to one for a negative 
versus a positive difference (around 66% to 
around 33%). Since the interest rate in-
crease impacts negatively on real GDP in 
both countries, a negative difference means 
that, as a consequence of the interest rate 
increase, real GDP in Germany declines 
more sharply than in France.8 Apart from 
the period in which the shock occurs, the 
75th percentile of the difference is near 
zero until around four quarters after the 
shock for the comparison between Ger-
many and Italy, which means that the prob-
ability ratio between a negative difference 
and a positive difference is around three to 
one. Beyond the subsequent horizon of up 
to around three years, the 66th percentile is 
close to the zero line, indicating a probabil-
ity ratio of about two to one for a negative 
versus a positive difference. These results 
collectively indicate a negative difference 
and thus a stronger decline in real GDP in Germany. The other country differences 
shown can be interpreted accordingly by 
using the information contained in the per-
centiles.

support the notion of greater real wage rigid -
ity.22
The finding in the analysis presented here 
– that real GDP shows a stronger response in 
Germany – can also be found in a number of 
other studies, such as that of Georgiadis (2015), 
which also only uses data since the euro was 
introduced. However, the findings for the rela -
tive ranking of the euro area countries are in -
consistent across the existing body of empirical 
studies as a whole, both in terms of GDP and 
price effects.23 The existing empirical analyses 
vary in terms of their estimation periods, model 
structures, the variables they contain and the 
methods they use to identify monetary policy 
impulses, which makes it difficult to compare 
the results. In addition, many of the studies 
– unlike the analyses presented here – do not 
use a rigorous statistical test strategy and are 
largely confined to a visual or tabular compari -
son of the estimated effects of monetary pol -
icy, which means it is unclear how these find -
ings can be assessed from a statistical perspec -
tive.24 Further research will be needed to reach 
a consensus on the differences and their deter -
minants.
Heterogeneous impact 
of changes in interest rate 
expectations ?
Besides changes in key monetary policy interest 
rates, there are other instruments that central 
banks can use to exert an influence on con -
sumer price developments. In the euro area, 
these instruments were deployed notably in 
the wake of the global financial crisis and the 
European sovereign debt crisis, when the ECB 
Governing Council reduced its policy rates to 
close to the effective lower bound, leaving only 
little room for further expansionary impulses by 
means of conventional monetary policy. These 
instruments include forward guidance, an ex -
plicit communication on the future path of 
monetary policy rates aimed at influencing 
interest rate expectations. According to the ex -pectations hypothesis of the term structure of 
interest rates, changes in expectations about 
the future path of short- term interest rates af -
fect medium to long- term capital market rates. 
In addition, communicating this information 
can reduce uncertainty about future policy 
rates and can also influence long- term interest 
rates via this channel.25
Basically, central banks can use forward guid -
ance to influence interest rate expectations in 
one direction or another. Even before the finan -
cial crisis, central banks were using communi -
cations to influence interest rate expectations 
– but their statements were, at the time, less 
explicit about the future path of monetary pol -
icy rates.26 During the negative interest rate 
policy period, the ECB Governing Council used 
forward guidance to provide additional expan -
sionary monetary policy impulses, even though 
the short- term money market rate had reached 
the effective lower bound.27
Since conventional policy rate changes also 
have an effect to a large extent through 
changes in expectations (see the chart on p. 39), 
it would be fair to assume that the effects of 
forward guidance on euro area economies are Existing body of

22 Such indicators include, for example, the degree of 
unionisation or coverage by collective wage agreements; 
see, for example, Babecky et al. (2010). These indicators do 
not suggest that real wage rigidity is stronger in Germany, 
however. Georgiadis (2015) regresses the trough response 
of the price level on possible explanatory variables, such as 
industry mix and labour market institutions, and finds that 
only the regression coefficient of the industry mix shows a 
value that is significantly different from zero at the 10% 
level.
23 See Mandler et al. (2022). A comprehensive overview of 
the empirical analyses on differences in the impact of mon -
etary policy on economic activity can be found in 
Dominguez-  Torres and Hierro (2019).
24 Excluded here is Ciccarelli and Rebucci (2006), in which 
the authors use the Kolmogorov-  Smirnov test to examine 
the statistical significance of cross- country differences.
25 For an explanation of forward guidance, see Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2013). A number of analyses of the effects of 
forward guidance, carried out using various models, are 
summarised in Taskforce on Rate Forward Guidance and 
Reinvestment (2022).
26 Nelson (2021) describes the emergence of forward 
guidance as a policy tool using the Federal Reserve as an 
example.
27 For an overview of the Eurosystem’s forward guidance 
and how it has changed over time, see Hartmann and 
Smets (2018) and Rostagno et al. (2019).Deutsche Bundesbank

quite similar to those of policy rate changes. 
However, one major difference is that forward 
guidance has a stronger impact on the middle 
part of the yield curve, while changes in policy 
rates have a more pronounced effect at the 
short end.28 It therefore makes sense to exam -
ine whether there are any country- specific dif -
ferences in the impact of monetary policy as 
regards forward guidance, too. For example, 
Mandler and Scharnagl (2023) analyse whether 
changes in expectations about the future short- 
term money market rate have different effects 
on the four large euro area economies. This an -
alysis can be interpreted as an approximation 
of the effects of forward guidance (see the 
annex on pp. 54 ff.).
The model used for the study is based on the 
one from the previous section but differs in 
that it contains expectations variables in an ef -
fort to capture the effects of changes in inter -
est rate expectations. The three- month interest 
rate is used as a policy indicator because ex -
pectations from the consensus forecasts are 
available for this rate. The model is outlined 
briefly on pp. 54 ff.
The charts on pp. 49 f. show the results of the 
cross-  country comparison of the responses of 
real GDP and the HICP to an increase of 25 bp 
in the three-  month interest rate expected in 
one year.29 As regards the response of real GDP 
to the expected rise in interest rates, the esti -
mated probability distributions of the differ -
ences between Germany and the three other 
countries for the first four to six quarters are 
predominantly in negative territory. This means 
that, following the restrictive interest rate ex -
pectations impulse, GDP falls more strongly in 
Germany than it does in the other three coun -
tries – that is, it shows a stronger response to 
the monetary policy impulse.30 The chart also 
indicates that real GDP in Italy is least sensitive 
to the change in expectations, with France and 
Spain lying between the two extremes.31 The 
differences between Germany, on the one 
hand, and France and Spain, on the other, sub -side over time, while the deviation of the effect 
in Italy shows a degree of persistence.
The differences in HICP responses across coun -
tries are less clearly pronounced. The estimated 
probability distributions for the comparison of 
Germany with the other three countries point 
to a stronger negative effect of the expected 
interest rate hike on consumer prices in Ger -
many. For the other countries, the differences 
are weaker and do not allow any clear conclu -
sions to be drawn. As the model used here is 
symmetrical, the corresponding effects in the 
opposite direction on real GDP and consumer 
prices are to be expected in the event of a de -
cline in expectations for the future monetary 
policy interest rate.
Just like a conventional interest rate shock, a 
change in interest rate expectations (given a 
constant actual interest rate) likewise leads to a 
stronger change in real GDP in Germany. How -
ever, the price level in Germany shows a 
stronger response to the expectations shock 
than it does in the other countries, while its 
response to the conventional interest rate im -BVAR model

28 See Taskforce on Rate Forward Guidance and Reinvest -
ment (2022), pp. 26 ff., and Altavilla et al. (2019). Mandler 
and Scharnagl (2023) compare the effects of policy rate 
changes with those of changes in interest rate expectations 
induced by monetary policy and find that the latter tend to 
impact more strongly on output and prices in some euro 
area countries. One reason for this is that expectations 
shocks induce a short- term interest rate response that is 
more persistent than conventional monetary policy im -
pulses.
29 The findings in Mandler and Scharnagl (2023) relate to 
an expected -10 bp shock to the three- month interest rate. 
To make them comparable with those from the analysis 
presented above, the results were recalculated for an ex -
pected +25 bp shock to the three- month interest rate.
30 More precisely, a negative difference means that real 
GDP in the first country falls more sharply or rises less 
sharply than in the second. As the sign restriction in this 
model refers only to the average across countries, part of 
the probability mass of the impulse response functions of 
real GDP is also in the positive range.
31 The distribution of the difference between France and 
Spain does not point in any clear direction. By contrast, the 
difference between France and Italy is mostly negative 
from around four quarters onwards, and in the positive 
range between Italy and Spain.Deutsche Bundesbank

pulse is smaller.32 This need not necessarily be a 
contradiction in terms but could be because a 
monetary policy impulse in the form of forward 
guidance in Germany impacts more strongly on 
producers’ price expectations than a change in 
the policy rate. This effect would, ceteris pari -
bus, amplify the effect of forward guidance on 
consumer prices (relative to a change in the key 
interest rate). To the extent that this effect does 
not materialise in other countries or does so 
only in a weakened form, this may change the 
order of the countries.33
Mandler and Scharnagl (2023) investigate pos -
sible reasons for the stronger GDP response in 
Germany to the change in expectations by in -
corporating additional variables into the model. 
This approach is useful at this juncture, unlike 
in the analysis presented in the previous sec -
tion, as the benchmark version of the model 
contains fewer variables, which means add -
itional variables can be more readily included.

32 In addition to the interest rate expectations shock, 
Mandler and Scharnagl (2023) also identify a conventional 
monetary policy interest rate shock – albeit one in which 
the three- month interest rate is used as the policy indicator. 
The cross- country comparison of the effects of this interest 
rate shock shows that real GDP in Germany exhibits a 
stronger response to conventional interest rate policy than 
it does in other countries, as in Mandler et al. (2022). 
Again, the HICP response is strongest in Spain. This would 
suggest the findings are robust for conventional monetary 
policy. The order of each of the other countries changes, in 
some cases, from Mandler et al. (2022) and depends on 
the response horizon under analysis. The two models differ, 
amongst other things, in terms of the estimation period, 
the variables they contain and the assumptions they make 
when identifying monetary policy impulses. The model was 
tested for robustness in Mandler et al. (2022) by newly esti -
mating the data subject to the restrictions described on 
p. 55 being imposed on the country averages of output and 
price responses, which thus brought it closer to the identi -
fication assumptions used in the later model. This exercise 
leads to a weakening of the country differences in the GDP 
response, though that response remains the strongest in 
Germany. By contrast, the price response continues to be 
strongest in Spain. This suggests that this identification ap -
proach is not driving the differences in the results.
33 In terms of model theory, this argument aims to ensure 
that the equilibrium in an economy, given a monetary pol -
icy impulse, not only moves along a given aggregate supply 
function, but that it also shifts vertically if price expect -
ations change. Hence, price level responses of different 
strengths for the two different monetary policy impulses 
can be consistent with the same slope in the aggregate 
supply function, provided that price expectations react 
with different strengths to the two impulses.Deutsche Bundesbank

ants which, for each of the countries, contain 
either the two-  year government bond yield, 
the spread between corporate and govern -
ment bonds (the “excess bond premium” – see 
Gilchrist and Mojon (2018)), real investment or 
loans to non- financial corporations along with 
the corresponding lending rate. The results in -
dicate that the change in the expected short-  
term interest rate in Germany leads to a more 
persistent change in financing costs than it 
does in other countries and has a stronger im -
pact on loans and investment.
Another important non-  standard monetary 
policy instrument used by the Eurosystem was 
the asset purchase programme (APP). Mandler 
and Scharnagl (2020) analyse possible differ -
ences in the effects of the APP on the four 
large euro area countries, again using a multi- 
country BVAR model (see the box on pp. 51f.). 
Instead of investigating the effect of a one- off 
monetary policy impulse, they compare the 
simulated effects of the APP over the period 
from the beginning of 2015 to the end of 2018. 
Their findings suggest that the APP has had a 
weaker impact on GDP in France compared 
with other countries. The differences between 
Germany, Italy and Spain are not strong enough 
to allow any conclusions to be drawn. The esti -
mated impact on the HICP is strongest in Spain 
and weakest in Italy, with Germany and France 
lying between the two with similar effects. 
However, different studies also come to differ -
ent conclusions on the effects of the APP .34Cross-country comparison of the impact

Unlike Mandler and Scharnagl (2020), however, they esti -
mate a stronger GDP effect in Germany than in other coun -
tries. Wieladek and Pascual (2016) estimate the strongest 
price effect in Germany and the strongest GDP effect in 
Spain. However, these studies compare the effect of a one-

Has the asset purchase programme (APP) affected euro 
area countries differently?
Mandler and Scharnagl (2020) use a BVAR 
model to examine whether the Eurosys-
tem’s APP has had differing impacts on the 
four major euro area economies. The pur-
chase programme was intended to provide 
expansionary monetary policy stimuli at a 
time when conventional monetary policy 
had little remaining scope for further inter-
est rate cuts.1 The empirical analysis esti-
mates and compares the effects of the pur-
chase programme from the beginning of 
2015, when it was adopted, up to the end 
of 2018, when net purchases were ended 
for the fi  rst time. Unlike the two papers in 
the main text, however, it does not com-
pare impulse responses to a monetary pol-
icy shock; instead, simulated effects of the 
APP on the four countries are compared.
The model consists of a block of euro area 
variables and blocks of country- specifi  c vari-
ables.2 The country- specifi  c blocks –  for 
France, Germany, Italy and Spain – contain 
real gross domestic product (GDP), the Har-
monised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), 
bank loans to non- fi  nancial corporations, 
the lending rate and the yield on govern-
ment bonds with a maturity of fi  ve years. 
The euro area block comprises fi  nancial 
variables for the euro area as a whole: the 
euro overnight index average (EONIA), a 
stock price index, the nominal effective ex-
change rate, the composite indicator of sys-
temic stress (CISS),3 the yield spread of cor-
porate over government bonds (excess 
bond premium), the average yield on gov-
ernment bonds with a maturity of fi  ve and 
ten years, and the spread between govern-
ment bond yields in Germany and the euro 
area average with a maturity of fi  ve years.The simulation of APP effects is calculated 
as the result of a sequence of monetary 
policy shocks. To this end, two monetary 
policy shocks are identifi  ed using sign re-
strictions: a conventional monetary policy 
shock, i.e. an interest rate policy shock, and 
an unconventional monetary policy shock. 
For the conventional monetary policy shock, 
it is assumed that a decline in the EONIA 
lowers government bond yields in the euro 
area and in the individual countries and that 
real GDP and the HICP increase on average 
across the four countries.4 Identifi  cation of 
the unconventional monetary policy shock 
is based on the documented fi  nancial mar-
ket effects of monetary policy purchase 
programmes (e.g. Altavilla et al. (2021)). 
The shock leads to an increase in the stock 
price index, a depreciation of the euro and 
a decline in government bond yields. In 
addition, it is assumed that the CISS and the 
excess bond premium decrease, i.e. that 
asset purchases reduce risk premia, and the 
yield spread between German government 
bonds and the euro area average declines, 
i.e. the German government bond yield falls 
less sharply than the euro area average. Fur-
thermore, the unconventional monetary 
policy shock leads to an increase in GDP 
and the HICP on average across the coun-
tries. The difference between the uncon-

ventional and conventional monetary policy 
shocks is that the former has no effect on 
the EONIA.5 All of these restrictions apply in 
the period in which the shocks occur.
The simulation of the effects of the APP is 
based on a series of expansionary uncon-
ventional monetary policy impulses. These 
impulses are calibrated such that their ef-
fects on the ten- year government bond 
yield correspond to the revisions to the as-
sumptions about this yield in the Eurosys-
tem’s macroeconomic projections over the 
analysis period. These assumptions refl  ect 
market expectations at the time of the rele-
vant projection. The simulation thus as-
sumes that these revisions to expectations 
were driven primarily by unconventional 
monetary policy and, above all, by the APP .6 
Taken in isolation, the expansionary effects 
of the unconventional monetary policy 
shocks would lead to an increase in the 
EONIA in line with the monetary policy re-
sponse function estimated in the model. In 
order to avoid this effect, which counter-
acts unconventional monetary policy meas-
ures, unconventional monetary policy 
shocks are combined with conventional 
ones to keep the EONIA at its baseline.7
The comparative approach described on 
pp. 44 ff. is applied to the simulated effects 
of the APP . Overall, the results indicate that 
the APP had a weaker impact on real GDP 
in France than in the other countries. The 
differences between Germany, Italy and 
Spain are not pronounced enough to dis-
cern a clear ranking. According to the esti-
mates, the impact on consumer prices was 
strongest in Spain and weakest in Italy, with 
Germany and France between the two ex-
tremes. Overall, the analysis shows that 
Germany, too, benefi  ted from the APP and 
that the programme’s effects in Germany 
were by no means the weakest among the 
countries under analysis.5 The identifi  cation of an unconventional monetary 
policy shock via the term structure with the central as-
sumption that an unconventional monetary policy 
shock affects the long- term interest rate but not the 
short- term money market rate follows Baumeister and 
Benati (2013).
6 Unconventional monetary policy shocks encompass 
all monetary policy measures that affect the term 
structure of interest rates according to the assump-
tions made during their identifi  cation. This also in-
cludes forward guidance, for example. Strictly speak-
ing, the simulations therefore estimate the combined 
effects of various unconventional monetary policy 
measures. When interpreting the results, it is assumed 
that the greatest share of these is attributable to the 
APP .
7 For details about the simulation, see Mandler and 
Scharnagl (2020). This approach is based on the fact 
that the Eurosystem’s scope for further interest rate 
cuts was limited by the effective lower bound and the 
APP was intended to provide expansionary monetary 
policy stimulus. Conventional monetary policy, which 
would counteract these expansionary monetary policy 
impulses, was therefore unlikely.Deutsche Bundesbank

Importance of regional 
differences  in monetary 
policy  transmission for 
monetary  policy
The current studies on country- specific differ -
ences in the effects of monetary policy in the 
euro area, together with the analyses pre -
sented here, suggest that the Eurosystem’s sin -
gle monetary policy has varying impacts across 
the euro area economies. This is true not only 
of the Eurosystem’s conventional interest rate 
policy but also of non- standard monetary pol -
icy measures such as forward guidance. Some 
of the analyses point to the structural differ -
ences between the economies that might play 
a role in this. However, the available studies 
typically only take into account a limited num -
ber of structural factors, and it remains unclear 
how important they are, including relative to 
one other, when it comes to explaining the dif -
ferences.
The results of the studies which document indi -
cations of varying impacts of monetary policy 
on the euro area countries differ, however, in 
terms of the relative ranking of the countries 
examined.35 Looking at the literature as a 
whole, it seems the results possess a certain de -
gree of sensitivity as regards the estimation 
period, the model structure and the identifica -
tion assumptions, amongst other factors. The 
importance of the specific ranking of countries 
therefore should not be overstated until a con -
sensus has been reached on this. What is more, 
it is possible this ranking could also change over 
time, for example owing to structural reforms. 
The following section therefore does not deal 
with the results for individual countries, but 
with the more fundamental implications of re -
gional differences in monetary policy transmis -
sion for the Eurosystem’s monetary policy.
The Eurosystem’s mandate is to maintain price 
stability within the euro area. Consequently, 
the Governing Council of the ECB has defined 
the price stability objective for the euro area as 
a whole on the basis of the HICP . This means that country- specific developments cannot play 
a role at the target level of monetary policy. 
However, this need not necessarily apply to the 
level below that at which the use of monetary 
policy instruments is calibrated (see Angelini et 
al. (2008)). This is not to be confused with a 
monetary policy geared primarily to national 
circumstances, though. The mandate of the Eu -
rosystem’s monetary policy relates to price sta -
bility in the euro area as a whole, and in this 
context country- specific factors only matter to 
the extent that they are relevant to inflation de -
velopments in the euro area. Thus, although 
the Governing Council of the ECB makes its de -
cisions based on economic developments in 
the euro area as a whole, disaggregated data, 
which include country- specific data, provide 
important information for monetary policy 
decision- making. These data help to improve 
the understanding and assessment of aggre -
gate inflation developments and the transmis -
sion mechanisms of monetary policy in the 
euro area (see Issing (2004)). Since the start of 
monetary union, both country-  specific data 
and microdata, for example about banks, have 
become more important for the analysis of 
monetary policy transmission.36
When preparing monetary policy decisions, the 
Eurosystem uses not only models at the aggre -
gate euro area level but also various multi-  
country models that capture differences in the 
interrelationships.37 This category also includes 
the models presented in this article. The key Literature pro -

35 See the discussion on p. 47. For example, in the analysis 
by Georgiadis (2015), the output response to an interest 
rate shock is weakest in France out of the four countries 
considered here, whereas the analysis in the section en -
titled “Heterogeneous impact of interest rate policy?” indi -
cates a stronger reaction in France than in Italy and Spain. 
While the output response is strongest in Germany in the 
analysis contained in the same section, Ciccarelli et al. 
(2013), for example, estimate that monetary policy has 
greater effects on the real GDP of euro area countries more 
affected by the financial and sovereign debt crisis.
36 See the overview of developments in monetary and 
financial analysis in Deutsche Bundesbank (2023). For an 
overview of the information about the inflation process 
and transmission at the euro area level contained in micro -
data on price- setting behaviour, see Dedola et al. (2023).

lini et al. (2019).Deutsche Bundesbank

macroeconomic projections are based on fore -
casts for the individual euro area countries, 
which are aggregated at the euro area level.38
Finally, it should be stressed that it is not the 
task of monetary policy to smooth out differ -
ences in the transmission of monetary policy 
across countries. Empirical evidence suggests 
that these differences are driven by structural 
and institutional factors that fall within the re -
sponsibility of other policy areas, particularly 
national ones. Moreover, differences in the re -gional effects of monetary policy are not a 
problem specific to a monetary union such as 
the euro area. Empirical analyses for the United 
States, for instance, also indicate that the Fed -
eral Reserve’s monetary policy does not have a 
homogeneous effect throughout the entire 
country (e.g. Carlino and DeFina (1998, 1999) 
and Pizzuto (2020)).Structural and 
institutional 
determinants of 
heterogeneous 
transmission are 
the responsibility 
of other policy 
areas
Annex: Brief outline of the models used
The analysis of differences in the impact of interest 
rate policy across the four major euro area countries 
in Mandler et al. (2022) uses a Bayesian vector au -
toregressive (BVAR) multi- country model.39 This flex -
ible approach captures possible interactions be -
tween all variables contained in the model for the 
different countries. Including all the countries in the 
empirical model is also a condition for the statistical 
analysis of differences in the impact of monetary 
policy (see the box on pp. 44 ff.).
The model is estimated based on quarterly data from 
the first quarter of 1999 to the third quarter of 2014. 
This excludes the subsequent period in which the 
Eurosystem steered the monetary policy stance 
mainly using the asset purchase programmes. For 
each of the four countries, the model contains real 
GDP , the HICP , the broad monetary aggregate M3, 
loans to the non-  financial private sector and the 
yield on government bonds with a maturity of five 
years. The yield on US government bonds with a ma -
turity of five years and a US shadow interest rate are 
included as additional variables to capture possible 
effects of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy or 
the international capital markets.40
The shadow interest rate of Wu and Xia (2016) 
serves as an indicator of monetary policy for the 
euro area. The results are qualitatively very similar 
when using the money market interest rate for over -
night loans (EONIA). Eurosystem monetary policy re -
sponds to economic developments in the euro area 
as a whole. While the model does not cover all euro 
area economies, the four countries it contains ac -
count for more than three- quarters of euro area real 
GDP over the estimation period. This should enable sufficiently sound empirical modelling of the Euro -
system’s monetary policy response to economic de -
velopments in the euro area.
Estimating the effects of interest rate policy requires 
separating the causal effects of monetary policy on 
the other variables from the endogenous response 
of monetary policy to changes in the macroeco -
nomic environment. To this end, “monetary policy 
shocks” are identified using sign restrictions: the an -
alysis assumes that an increase in the monetary pol -
icy interest rate leads to a decline in real GDP and 
the HICP in all countries within the same quarter.41 
Under this assumption, the estimated model can be 
used to calculate the responses of all variables to an 
interest rate rise in the Eurosystem, known as im -
pulse response functions.
39 For a precise description of the model and the estima -
tion approach, see Mandler et al. (2022). Mandler et al. 
(2016, 2017) represent earlier versions of this analysis, 
which was further developed into the version summarised 
here during the publication process.
40 A shadow interest rate is a hypothetical overnight 
money market rate that would have arisen in the absence 
of a binding effective lower bound. It is estimated using 
interest rates of different maturities from a term structure 
model. The shadow interest rate responds to changes in 
short- term interest rates, i.e. to the central bank’s conven -
tional monetary policy, as well as to non-standard monet -
ary policy measures that affect medium and longer- term 
interest rates. For an overview of the construction and in -
terpretation of the shadow interest rate, see Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2017).
41 Another assumption is that an increase in real GDP or in 
the price level in a given country, taken in isolation, leads to 
an increase in the monetary policy interest rate in the same 
quarter, i.e. the coefficients of current output and price 
levels are assumed to be positive in the monetary policy 
response function; see Arias et al. (2019).38 For an overview of the projections, see European Cen -
tral Bank (2016). This approach draws on the expertise 
available at the national level and allows for the inclusion 
of different national data sources and institutions.Deutsche Bundesbank

The analysis of the effects of changes in interest rate 
expectations is taken from the study by Mandler and 
Scharnagl (2023). The model used in that study is 
similar to the one used to analyse actual interest rate 
changes. Compared with the model described 
above, however, it contains fewer country- specific 
variables and has instead been expanded to include 
expectations variables, based on D’Amico and King 
(2023), which allow the effects of expectations 
shocks to be captured.
The model contains real GDP and the HICP for each 
country. For the euro area as a whole, it contains 
real GDP , the HICP , the average yield on government 
bonds with a maturity of five years, a stock price 
index and the three-  month money market interest 
rate as a monetary policy indicator. Additional vari -
ables are the oil price and the yield on US govern -
ment bonds with a maturity of five years. These vari -
ables are supplemented by consensus expectations 
for the euro area as a whole on future real GDP , the 
future HICP and the future three- month interest 
rate.42 The three- month interest rate is used as a 
monetary policy indicator because consensus ex -
pectations are available for the three- month interest 
rate, but not for the overnight interest rate or a 
shadow interest rate in the euro area. Mandler and 
Scharnagl (2023) estimate three model variants 
which differ in terms of the time horizon of the ex -
pectations variables – two, four or six quarters 
ahead. The results summarised in the main text re -
late to the model which includes expectations vari -
ables with a four- quarter horizon. The analyses for 
the other expectations horizons result in the same 
ranking of countries in terms of the effects of mon -
etary policy.43
This analysis focuses on the causal effects of a 
change in interest rate expectations. The required 
identification of an interest rate expectations shock 
is accomplished using sign and zero restrictions:44 
under these assumptions, an increase in the ex -
pected three- month interest rate leads to a decline 
in both current and expected real GDP and the HICP 
in the euro area. In addition, the stock price index 
falls and the government bond yield rises. The inter -
est rate expectations shock is assumed to have no 
effect on the current three- month interest rate (zero 
restriction). This requirement separates the effects of 
a change in the expected three- month interest rate 
from those of a change in the current three- month 
interest rate. All of these restrictions apply to the 
quarter in which the shock occurs. As in D’Amico and King (2017), consistency between changes in 
the expected three- month interest rate and the sub -
sequent actual change in the rate is also required 
(forecast consistency). If the three-  month interest 
rate expected in a given year decreases by a certain 
number of basis points, the actual three- month 
interest rate four quarters after the stimulus must 
also have fallen by this number of basis points. Simi -
lar consistency assumptions are made for the actual 
and expected changes in real GDP and the HICP . For 
country- specific real GDP and consumer prices, 
Mandler and Scharnagl (2023) assume that an in -
crease in the expected three- month interest rate 
leads, in the same quarter, to a decline in the aver -
ages of GDP and the HICP weighted by the real GDP 
of the respective countries. These assumptions are 
less restrictive than requiring a negative response of 
real GDP and the HICP in each individual country.
In this analysis, too, the estimation period starts in 
the first quarter of 1999, but ends in the fourth 
quarter of 2018. The Governing Council of the ECB 
used forward guidance mainly in the negative inter -
est rate period that began in 2014, to provide add -
itional expansionary monetary policy stimuli. Never -
theless, interest rate expectations were already influ -
enced before that by the Eurosystem’s communica -
tion, even in cases where the actual policy rates did 
not change. Assuming that the effects of these 
changes in expectations are similar to those of more 
explicit forward guidance on interest rates, the pre- 
2013 data are therefore also informative in this re -
spect.
The effects of forward guidance are also analysed in 
structural macroeconomic models.45 In the BVAR 
model used here, the short- term interest rate ex -
pected for a given future date changes, and the ac -
tual value of this interest rate at that later date must 
42 The growth and inflation expectations from the consen -
sus survey are converted into expectations about output 
and the price level for the analysis. Real GDP and the HICP 
for the euro area are included in the model in order to es -
tablish a link between the realised and expected variables.
43 For the other results, see Mandler and Scharnagl (2023) 
and the online appendix.
44 The published study refers to an expansionary expect -
ations shock, i.e. an expected decline in the three-  month 
interest rate. In order to make the results more comparable 
with those of the other study, the main text and these ex -
planatory notes describe an expected interest rate rise. As 
the model is symmetrical, these results are obtained simply 
by reversing the signs accordingly.

ance and Reinvestment (2022), Section 3.Deutsche Bundesbank

be consistent with this change in expectations, i.e. 
must differ by the same amount from the original 
baseline. Before and after that, however, the path of 
the short- term interest rate is unrestricted, aside 
from the fact that it may not respond immediately to 
the change in expectations. This is comparable to 
the modelling of forward guidance in the structural 
model of Giannoni et al. (2015). They also allow the 
short- term interest rate to react endogenously to the 
impact of the announced and expected future 
change in the monetary policy rate.46 However, the 
modelling approach presented here is less compar -
able to a number of other structural models, which model forward guidance in such a way that, after 
the announcement of future interest rate policy, the 
monetary policy interest rate remains on its starting 
path and does not deviate from the original interest 
rate path, i.e. the one expected prior to the an -
nouncement, until the time to which the announce -
ment referred (e.g. Levin et al. (2010) and McKay et 
al. (2016)).

Models for short- term economic fore casting 
during the recent crises
Short- term business cycle analysis at the Bundesbank is designed to obtain a robust assessment 
of the economic situation and the immediate outlook. The focus is on the quarterly growth rate 
of seasonally and calendar- adjusted gross domestic product (GDP). A key role is played here by 
econometric forecasting models, which are augmented by the economic forecasters’ expert 
knowledge. This combination yields the Bundesbank’s final assessment of the economic situation.
The COVID-  19 pandemic and the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine have presented con -
siderable challenges for business cycle analysis and forecasting. The repeated containment meas -
ures during the pandemic and their subsequent easing led to massive swings in economic activity 
and high uncertainty about the economic situation and outlook. This uncertainty was heightened 
by the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine. Both events entailed economic burdens that 
were not adequately reflected by the conventional models in the Bundesbank’s and other fore -
casters’ toolboxes. The timely provision of robust model- based forecasts was thus not possible. 
This gave the expertise of business cycle experts a position of prominence.
Against this background, the toolbox for short- term forecasting has been modified and aug -
mented. In addition, new methods and models that model economic activity at a higher frequency  
than quarterly have been introduced. Examples include the estimation of monthly GDP, a weekly 
activity index and the development of a weekly GDP indicator.
On average, the accuracy of the revised and new GDP forecasting models for the current quarter 
and the quarter just ended is higher than that of a simple comparison model in which the GDP 
rate is extrapolated using the historical average. The bridge equation model, which has the high -
est overall accuracy, also achieves this for forecasts one quarter ahead. The model forecast accur -
acy, which deteriorated massively following the outbreak of the pandemic, has improved again 
considerably since the end of 2020. However, it has not yet returned to its pre- pandemic level. 
Therefore, the knowledge and judgement of business cycle experts is likely to remain of promin -
ent importance for the foreseeable future.Deutsche Bundesbank

Challenges in post- pandemic 
economic forecasting for 
models and experts
A timely and accurate assessment of the cur -
rent economic situation and outlook plays an 
important role for monetary policy decisions. 
The Bundesbank’s short- term business cycle 
analysis is intended to reliably assess macroeco -
nomic activity and its determinants. It is centred 
on the growth rate of real GDP in the current 
quarter and one to two quarters ahead.1 The 
Bundesbank regularly communicates its quali -
tative assessment of the German economy to 
the public in its Monthly Reports. The short-  
term forecast is also included as a quantitative 
benchmark in the semi- annual macroeconomic 
projections for the German economy.2
Ongoing business cycle analysis at the Bundes -
bank is based on combining quantitative 
methods with qualitative approaches. This 
means that econometric models form the basis 
for short- term economic forecasting, which is 
then rounded off with the expertise and experi -
ence of economic experts. In this manner, the 
various model results are classified and merged, 
and information that cannot be fully captured 
by the pure model forecasts can be incorpor -
ated into the business cycle assessment.
Before the COVID-  19 pandemic, there were 
three established forecasting models in the 
Bundesbank’s business cycle analysis and fore -
cast: a bridge equation model, a dynamic fac -
tor model and a vector autoregressive (VAR) 
model. While these models follow different ap -
proaches, what they have in common is that 
they contain different economic indicators in 
order to cover as many areas of economic ac -
tivity as possible. In addition, they can process 
data that are available at different frequencies 
and for which observations are missing at the 
current end due to publication delays.3
The crises of the past three years have posed 
considerable challenges to forecasting models 
and business cycle analysis. The COVID-  19 pan -demic and the measures taken to contain it led 
to historically unprecedented interventions in 
economic processes. From March 2020 on -
wards, they caused sudden and very strong 
fluctuations in economic activity. In Germany, 
GDP fluctuations of this magnitude were previ -
ously unknown.4 In addition, economic uncer -
tainty increased considerably. As pandemic-  
related uncertainties were gradually subsiding 
in early 2022, the Russian war of aggression 
against Ukraine and its impact on the economy 
introduced a new set of substantial imponder -
ables. For instance, the energy markets were, 
at times, in danger of sliding into considerable 
turmoil. Traditional models were not prepared 
for these circumstances, and there were con -
siderable doubts about the reliability of their 
results. One outcome was that economic ex -
perts’ know- how took on a stronger role in ap -
plied business cycle analysis. Another was that 
the abrupt changes in the economic frame -
work required rapid and significant modifica -
tions to the forecasting models and to the en -
tire business cycle analysis toolbox.5
The difficulties of the models were, amongst 
other things, due to the delay in the publica -
tion of most monthly economic indicators. As a 
result, information on the possible effects on 
the economy could be incorporated into the 
models only with a time lag. Some effects, Business cycle

information on the short- term forecasting models used at 
the Bundesbank, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2018a).
4 The decline in GDP in the second quarter of 2020 was 
approximately eleven times the average fluctuations in 
GDP , measured by the standard deviation between 1991 
and 2019. No such movements had hitherto been seen ei -
ther in Germany since 1991, or in the available quarterly 
GDP rates for West Germany between 1970 and 1990.
5 The toolbox for short- term economic forecasts is gener -
ally continuously evolving. Therefore, the models used are 
reviewed at regular intervals. The last scheduled update 
took place in 2018; see Deutsche Bundesbank (2018a). The 
modifications since then have focused on the conse -
quences of the crises.Deutsche Bundesbank

such as the mandatory business closures to 
avoid contact and contagion, were also virtu -
ally impossible to model. Traditional data did 
not reflect those effects at all, or not in full, or 
not in a timely manner.6 In addition, the fluctu -
ations in activity increased the uncertainty of 
the model estimates and thus diminished the 
robustness of the forecasts. Moreover, the 
usual forecasting models were not suited to 
adequately take into account the measures to 
contain the pandemic and the massive disrup -
tions in the energy markets resulting from the 
Russian war of aggression against Ukraine. All 
of this increased forecast uncertainty and thus 
weakened the reliability of the model results.
Uncertainty and how to deal with it, as well as 
major swings in economic activity, are not fun -
damentally new to forecasters. There are vari -
ous approaches to dealing with such chal -
lenges. With regard to the econometric model 
estimation, for example, one possible approach 
lies in removing from the estimation the 
pandemic- induced outliers in the data.7 Al-
though that would make it possible to avoid 
the undesirable impact of large fluctuations in 
the data on the model estimation, this ap -
proach would not be able to adequately cap -
ture the unusually sharp increase in uncertainty 
about economic developments as a result of 
the pandemic and the historically unpreced -
ented intervention measures. Another proposal 
is therefore to model time- varying residual 
volatility adapted to the data outliers (stochas -
tic volatility).8 This can improve the model esti -
mation and the forecast. In addition, the uncer -
tainty surrounding economic forecasts can also 
be taken into account. Lastly, in order to re -
ceive timely economic signals in times of very 
rapid economic fluctuations, collective high-  
frequency economic indicators were also de -
veloped in the early phase of the COVID-  19 
pandemic based, amongst other things, on 
daily or weekly indicators that are available in a 
timely manner.9Modifications to the model 
toolbox
The short- term forecasting models at the 
Bundesbank have been revised in line with the 
foregoing proposals from the academic litera -
ture. The main focus was on making the fore -
casting models more robust to large fluctu -
ations in data and an economic environment 
with a high degree of uncertainty. This was in -
tended to enable them to provide robust fore -
casts in times of economic tranquillity and tur -

bank’s established forecasting models will be 
presented below.
The Bundesbank’s bridge equation model con -
sists of a system of individual forecast equa -
tions. This system is based on the structure of 
the national accounts. The GDP aggregate can 
thus be forecast directly. In addition, a GDP 
forecast can also be calculated by aggregating 
the forecasts of the production-side and 
demand-side components developed on the 
basis of monthly economic indicators.10 Des-
pite their sophisticated structure, the bridge 
equations were unable to adequately capture 
the impact on economic activity of the pan -
demic and the measures taken to contain it. 
The relatively rapid and strong fluctuations in 
economic activity caused forecasts to over -
shoot in both directions after the pandemic 
situation had already reversed itself. To make 
the model more robust to such strong fluctu -
ations in activity, various modifications were 
examined to see whether they improve fore -
cast quality during the pandemic without sig -
nificantly worsening it in the pre- pandemic 
period.11
Reducing the use of lagged variables in the 
model equations has proved useful. In normal 
times, to be sure, lagged variables improve the 
adaptation of the estimation equations to the 
data and thus, on average, also the forecast 
quality. However, in times of high and unsys -
tematic volatility, they often lead to false sig -
nals. Therefore, lagged endogenous and ex -
ogenous variables have been omitted from the 
quarterly bridge equations. Lagged endogen -
ous variables are no longer used in the up -
stream equations for extrapolating monthly-  
frequency indicators, either.12
A further modification relates to the GDP com -
ponents that were – in the absence of suitable 
leading indicators  – previously extrapolated 
using naive forecasts.13,14 These components 
are now extrapolated at the same growth rate 
as the superordinated areas for which reliable 
indicators are generally available. The modifica -tion rests on the assumption that similar sec -
tors of the economy are driven by similar deter -
minants.15
The VAR model is designed as a Bayesian, 
mixed- frequency model, with a quarterly vari -
able – GDP – and a dataset of monthly indica -
tors.16 These include hard indicators such as 
industrial production, production in the main 
construction sector and real retail sales, as well 
as soft survey- based indicators such as the ifo 
business climate index.17 The sharp fluctuations 
in the data at the start of the pandemic dis -
torted parameter estimation. These distortions 
were then extrapolated via the extensive feed -
back effects; this had an adverse impact on 
forecast quality.Pandemic

10 For both the production and demand sides, a direct 
GDP forecast and two forecasts using variants disaggre -
gated to different depths are prepared. The forecasts on 
both sides are averaged. The two (production and 
demand-side) forecasts calculated in this way are then 
weighted and merged to form a final GDP forecast. For a 
detailed description of the bridge equation model used at 
the Bundesbank, see Pinkwart (2018) and Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2018a).
11 Further changes have been made compared to the 
bridge equation model described in Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2018a). For example, the underlying dataset was ex -
panded by 100 time series, which mainly contain additional 
details from the ifo Institute’s and S&P Global’s business 
surveys, to a total of 233 monthly indicators. Specifications 
of the forecast of individual GDP components were also 
modified and the error correction mechanisms used in 
some equations were deactivated. Although, in some 
cases, the error correction mechanism makes theoretical 
sense, empirical evidence has shown that it does not con -
tribute to an improvement in the forecast quality.
12 However, lagged exogenous variables are still included 
owing to the leading properties of the leading indicators 
used.
13 Naive forecasts are those according to historical aver -
ages or on the basis of autoregressive processes.
14 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2018a), p. 22.
15 For example, mean forecasting was previously used for 
the following areas of gross value added in the services 
sector: transportation, finance and insurance services, pub -
lic services, education and healthcare, and other services. 
Assume now that these sectors follow the same dynamics 
as services excluding these sectors. The components of 
government demand (consumption and investment) are 
excluded from this modification and continue to be ex -
trapolated using mean forecasting. Procyclical behaviour 
would not be economically plausible here – especially in 
times of economic crises.
16 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2018a), p. 22 and Götz and 
Hauzenberger (2021).

ber of persons in employment, new orders in industry and 
real exports and imports.Deutsche Bundesbank

In the version of the VAR model used in short- 
term forecasting practice prior to the outbreak 
of the pandemic, all model parameters were 
considered to be time- invariant.18 The revision 
allowed for time variation in volatility. It can 
help to incorporate large fluctuations in the 
data and thus mitigate distortion in the param -
eter estimation.19 This makes forecasts more 
robust in the event of large fluctuations, with -
out sacrificing forecast quality in normal times.
A further improvement in the VAR model was 
achieved in the area of Bayesian model estima -
tion. In VAR models with time- varying volatility, 
parameters that determine the dynamics of 
time- varying volatility are often given values 
derived from the literature.20 Under the modi -
fied variant of the model, these parameters are 
determined based on data instead.21 This 
allows the parameters to be estimated more 
precisely and the forecast quality to be signifi -
cantly improved.22
The factor model was replaced with a re -
vamped model of the same category.23 This is a 
dynamic factor model that is capable of pro -
cessing indicators with different publication 
frequencies and lags. It also takes into account 
stochastic volatility in the residuals. This allows 
large fluctuations in the data to be captured in 
the time- varying residuals in part and a poten -
tial distortion of the parameter estimation to 
be mitigated.
The new factor model estimates a large num -
ber of model specifications24 which result from 
all possible combinations of GDP and a set of 
monthly indicators.25 GDP growth shows up as 
the target in each specification of the factor 
model. The number of factors is re- estimated 
for each model specification before each model 
run.26 For each model run, the 32,767 point 
forecasts of GDP growth (one per model speci -
fication) form an empirical forecast distribution. 
This distribution is then used to generate two 
combined point forecasts for GDP growth: an 
unweighted median forecast and a forecast 
weighted by past quality.27New methods and models in 
the toolbox
Although the Bundesbank’s traditional short-  
term forecasting models are also based on 
modelling quarterly GDP , estimation methods 
with conventional monthly economic indica -
tors and survey- based sentiment indicators are 
applied for the most part. While the latter are 
at least available at the end of the reporting 
month, the economic indicators in the official 
statistics are released with a lag of one to two Time- varying

18 This version of the VAR model essentially borrows from 
the model of Schorfheide and Song (2015); see Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2018a).
19 For methodological details, see Götz and Hauzenberger 
(2021).
20 See, in particular, Schorfheide and Song (2015) as well 
as Götz and Hauzenberger (2021).
21 See Chan (2023).
22 In addition, the monthly set of indicators is augmented 
by a “weather variable”: the ifo indicator of weather-  
related constraints to construction. In the VAR model, this 
indicator is entered into the equation of production in the 
main construction sector – exogenously with a current and 
a lagged value. The weather channel then unfolds across 
all other variables via interdependencies with the main con -
struction sector. For exogenous indicators, the extrapola -
tion is carried out outside the model. The long- term aver -
ages of the individual months are used for the weather-  
related constraints to construction. This extension reflects 
the growing importance of weather- related fluctuations in 
activity as a result of climate change.
23 For a comprehensive overview of the model, the esti -
mation procedure and the technical details, see Eraslan and 
Schröder (2023).
24 The model estimation is based on a new and fast algo -
rithm that is based on the algorithm of Koop and Korobilis 
(2014), extended for a mixed- frequency model. The estima -
tion method makes it possible to estimate a large number 
of model specifications more quickly than with Bayesian or 
frequency estimation methods.
25 In addition to quarterly GDP , the dataset contains 15 
monthly indicators: industrial production, new orders re -
ceived by industry, production in the main construction 
sector, exports and imports of goods, number of persons in 
employment, sales in industry, hotels and restaurants and 
in the retail trade, consumer price index, HWWI commod -
ity price index, DAX, three- month EURIBOR rate and ifo 
business situation and expectations in manufacturing. The 
indicators are adjusted for calendar, seasonal and price 
variations, where appropriate. This results in 215 -1 = 32,767 
different model specifications with 2 to 16 indicators.
26 The number of factors for each model specification is 
estimated using the statistical criterion of Bai and Ng 
(2002).
27 The weighted point forecast is calculated using dynamic 
model averaging; see Raftery et al. (2010). In this method, 
the model specifications, which have led to smaller forecast 
errors in the recent past, are given a higher weight. These 
weights are updated after each new GDP release. The 
weighted forecasts are the focus of applied business cycle 
analysis and this article.Deutsche Bundesbank

months. During the pandemic, however, there 
were some phases where economic activity 
changed significantly within a quarter or even 
within a month. Quarterly and even monthly 
indicators only capture these fluctuations inad -
equately or with a time lag. Following the out -
break of the COVID-  19 pandemic, the Bundes -
bank therefore used a number of methods 
which were unconventional at the time, mod -
elling economic activity at a higher frequency 
than quarterly. To a degree, these approaches 
also take into account innovative indicators 
that are recorded on a weekly or daily basis 
and are therefore available more quickly.
In one such approach, monthly GDP is esti -
mated using a regression- based interpolation.28 
Five monthly economic indicators are included 
in the estimate: industrial production, real retail 
sales, real exports of goods, production in the 
main construction sector and real turnover in 
the hotel and restaurant industry.29 For the esti -
mate, an unobservable monthly GDP series is 
regressed on monthly indicator variables, en -
suring that the quarterly average of the esti -
mated monthly GDP corresponds to the pub -
lished quarterly GDP .
For the short- term forecast, quarterly GDP is in -
terpolated using the method described above 
and extrapolated beyond the current end. In a 
first step, indicators for the months with data 
that have not yet been published are extrapo -
lated. The respective forecasts from the bridge 
equation model are used for this purpose. In a 
second step, a calculation is then made of 
monthly GDP – including the forecast for quar -
terly GDP . This approach, referred to herein -
after as the MGDP model, thus paints a picture 
of changes in economic activity within a quar -
ter. This is particularly advantageous if the ac -
tivity is clearly moving in one direction and thus 
creates a positive or negative carry- over effect 
for the following quarter. The MGDP model 
also provided a useful tool for economic ex -
perts to harness non- model- based information 
on the pandemic in a transparent and model-  
based way for their expert assessment. For in -stance, it allowed markdowns to the model-  
based extrapolations of turnover in the hotel 
and restaurant sector or in retail to be made 
based on expert knowledge, for instance, 
when measures to contain the COVID-  19 pan -
demic were tightened. The auxiliary forecasts 
produced in this manner were thus improved 
considerably in these phases, as such abrupt 
adjustments are not captured promptly in the 
pure model forecasts.
The Bundesbank’s weekly activity index (WAI) 
was developed in the early phase of the COVID- 
19 pandemic.30 In addition to GDP and indus -
trial production, it is composed of indicators 
that are recorded weekly or even daily and are 
available in a very timely manner. These indica -
tors, which were unconventional back then, 
were selected according to two criteria: they 
should, first, cover different sectors of the 
economy and, second, contain relevant infor -
mation for real economic activity. This includes, 
for example, pedestrian frequency figures in 
inner- city shopping streets and credit card pay -
ments, which partly capture consumer behav -
iour, or indicators based on Google search 
queries for unemployment and short- time 
work, which relate to the labour market.31… such as the

28 The interpolation method is based on an approach by 
Chow and Lin (1971). For application of the procedure to 
Germany, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2021); for application 
of the procedure to the euro area, see Mönch and Uhlig 
(2005) and Deutsche Bundesbank (2020a).
29 When selecting monthly indicators, the explanatory 
power with regard to the estimation of monthly GDP as 
well as the sign and stability of the estimated parameters 
was investigated for various model constellations. As in 
Mönch and Uhlig (2005), the ratio of the variance of the 
change in estimated monthly GDP to the sum of the vari -
ance of the change in estimated monthly GDP and the vari -
ance of the residual is used as a measure for the explana -
tory power.

Evaluation of forecast quality: cross- comparison between 
models and comparison over time
This box uses historical forecast quality to 
evaluate the short- term forecasting models 
for gross domestic product (GDP) used in 
business cycle analysis.1 To this end, the 
models’ past forecast errors are calculated. 
The target against which forecasts are 
evaluated is the quarterly growth rate of 
seasonally and calendar- adjusted real GDP . 
Forecast quality is measured based on the 
mean absolute error (MAE). For each fore-
cast horizon, the MAE is calculated as the 
arithmetic average of the difference in size 
between the forecast and the realised fi  g-
ures.2The evaluation period runs from the fi  rst 
quarter of 2010 to the fi  rst quarter of 2023. 
Forecast quality based on the MAE is illus-
trated for two periods. The fi  rst period from 
the fi  rst quarter of 2010 to the fourth quar-
ter of 2019 includes the relatively calm 
periods for the German economy following 
the fi  nancial crisis and before the COVID- 19 
pandemic. The second period covers the 
entire evaluation period. It thus also in-
cludes the exceptionally strong fl  uctuations 
in activity and the heightened uncertainty in 
the period following the onset of the 
COVID- 19 pandemic and the start of Rus-
sia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. In 
both periods, the MAE of the short- term 
forecasting models is compared with the 
MAE of a simple (“naive”) comparison 
model. In the comparison model, the GDP 
growth rate is extrapolated using its histor-
ical mean. Over time, short- term forecast-
ing models can take more and more infor-
mation into account. Their forecast errors 
can therefore be expected to decrease as 
the forecast horizon shrinks.31 The forecast evaluation is based on data as at 
25 May 2023. Since the historical forecasts are calcu-
lated on the basis of fi  nal data, this exercise takes 
place in “pseudo real time”. Although this replicated 
the respective data availability, it was not possible to 
take into account historical data revisions. Two fore-
casts per month are calculated for each target quarter. 
The fi  rst forecast for a target quarter is calculated ap-
proximately one week after the release of the fl  ash 
estimate for the quarter two quarters earlier, i.e. 19 
weeks before the end of the forecast quarter. Fore-
casts for the target quarter are then calculated every 
two weeks until the target fi  gure is published. Accord-
ingly, the forecast horizon is given in weeks relative to 
the forecast quarter and ranges from t–19  to t+3, 
where t denotes the end of the quarter. For example, 
the horizons from t–19  to t–13  indicate the forecasts 
one quarter ahead, and the horizons t–11 to t–1 cover 
the forecasts for the current quarter. Since GDP is not 
published until around four weeks after the end of the 
reference quarter, forecasts for the previous quarter 
are also prepared up to this point in time (t +1 and 
t+3).
2 For example, an MAE of 0.2 means that the forecast 
fl  uctuates 0.2 percentage point around the actual val-
ues on average.
3 The factor model calculates weighted forecasts for 
GDP growth based on past forecast quality. In business 
cycle analysis as practised by the Bundesbank, this 
weighting takes forecast quality into account using 
real- time data. However, complete real- time data re-
cords are not available for all models under consider-
ation. For this reason, weighting for the factor model 
was also calculated using the fi  nal data in this evalu-
ation. This ensures better comparability with the other 
models.Mean absolute forecast errors*

In the evaluation period ending in 2019, the 
short- term forecasting models produce bet-
ter predictions than the naive forecast over 
almost the entire forecast horizon. The 
MGDP model is an exception in some in-
stances. The models’ accuracy tends to in-
crease as the publication date approaches, 
as more information is available. A cross- 
comparison of the models shows that the 
bridge equation model has the highest ac-
curacy on average over almost all forecast 
horizons. The VAR and factor models per-
form somewhat worse. The MGDP model 
has the lowest accuracy.
Looking at the entire evaluation period up 
to the beginning of 2023, the average fore-
cast errors are signifi  cantly higher for all 
models. This refl  ects the deterioration in 
forecasting capacity in the period from 
2020 onwards, which is now also con-
sidered, as a result of the impact of the 
pandemic and the Ukraine war.4 For the longer forecast horizons, the models are 
now not always superior to a naive fore-
cast. This does not apply to the bridge 
equation model, which at the same time 
also proves more accurate in a cross- 
comparison with the other models across 
almost all forecast horizons.
In addition, the cumulative absolute error 
(CAE) is calculated. This metric sums to-
gether the absolute forecast errors over 
time for a given forecast horizon. It thus 
summarises developments in forecast errors 
over the evaluation period. This has the ad-
vantage of making it easy to spot periods 
with particularly high forecast errors. They 
are characterised by a steeper slope or a 
sharp rise in the CAE. By way of example, 
three specifi  c horizons are considered: the 
last forecast for the previous quarter pro-
duced shortly before publication of the 
fl  ash estimate (t +3), the last forecast for 
the current quarter (t–1 ), and the last fore-
cast calculated one quarter ahead (t–13 ).
According to the CAE, as for the MAE, the 
short- term forecasting models perform bet-
ter than the comparison model for the 
shorter forecast periods t +3 and t–1 . The 
differences in the accuracy between the 
models is also similar: the bridge equation 
model cumulates the smallest errors, the 
factor and VAR models somewhat more 
and close to one other, and the MGDP 
model somewhat higher still.
The exceptionally large forecast errors for 
the fi  rst three quarters of 2020 due to the 
COVID- 19 pandemic are clearly refl  ected in 
the CAEs: they spike higher for all models. 
4 As the forecasting models used here derive their 
forecast quality from identifying historical relationships 
between variables, and the fl  uctuations during the 
COVID- 19 pandemic, in particular, were historically 
unique, the deterioration in accuracy comes as no 
great surprise.Cumulative absolute forecast errors*

The WAI32 is calculated as the common factor 
driving the underlying indicators.33 It provides a 
timely assessment of current real economic ac -
tivity and also exhibits a high correlation with 
quarterly GDP growth. However, the WAI data 
are not easy to interpret as the indicator looks 
at moving 13- week periods within a quarter. 
Moreover, the WAI does not provide forecasts 
for quarterly GDP growth rates either.
Given the limitations of the WAI, a dynamic 
factor model has been developed to estimate a 
weekly GDP indicator (WGDP indicator).34 The 
WGDP indicator is calculated as a common fac -
tor driving the indicators available at different 
frequencies35. The model is based on weekly 
growth rates and can approximate latent 
weekly GDP growth rates. In addition, ob -
served data from monthly and quarterly indica -
tors are taken into account. In terms of both 
growth rates and its level, the WGDP indicator 
roughly adds up to the observed quarterly GDP .The WGDP indicator has some advantages over 
the WAI when it comes to the ongoing observa -
tion of the business cycle. Above all, a clear in -
terpretation can be made within one quarter. A 
calculation can be made every week of the 
quarter- on- quarter (rate of) change in GDP , for 
example. In addition, the model can generate 
purely data- based forecasts for quarterly GDP 
growth (and the level of GDP) on a weekly basis.High correlation

for GDP growthFor the horizons t +3 and t–1, it is evident 
that the errors of the forecasting models in-
crease signifi  cantly less than those of the 
comparison model. The forecasting models 
therefore performed better than the com-
parison forecast during this period. Errors 
increase least in the MGDP model; it was 
thus best able to anticipate the strong fl  uc-
tuations in activity at that time. For t– 13, 
however, the forecasting models show no 
advantage over the comparison model dur-
ing the same period. For all models, CAEs 
rise by a similar magnitude. In general, the 
accuracy of the forecasts is lower on aver-
age for longer horizons. However, this 
shows, above all, that the forecasting 
models were simply unable to identify the 
COVID- 19 pandemic and its effects so far in 
advance.
From the fourth quarter of 2020 onwards, 
the forecast quality for all three horizons improved considerably again as compared 
with the beginning of 2020 but it is still 
notice ably impaired.5 The accuracy of the 
short- term forecasting models is not yet 
back to where it was before the COVID- 19 
pandemic. However, this is not surprising 
given the volatile economic environment of 
the past three years.
5 This is refl  ected in the somewhat steeper slope of 
the CAE compared with the slope before 2020.
32 The WAI is based on 13- week moving averages of the 
indicators and their 13- week growth rates. It fluctuates 
around its mean, which is zero by construction, and there -
fore provides the trend- adjusted growth rate of real eco -
nomic activity. For the methodology and the technical de -
tails of the WAI, see Eraslan and Götz (2021).
33 Indicators that are originally available on a daily basis 
feed into the calculation as weekly averages. The indicators 
are adjusted for calendar, seasonal and price variations, 
where appropriate. See Ollech (2023) for details on the 
seasonal adjustment of high- frequency indicators.
34 See Eraslan and Reif (2023).
35 Similar to the WAI, the WGDP indicator is based on a 
dataset consisting of weekly, monthly and quarterly indica -
tors with different release patterns. However, in order to 
improve the explanatory power of the WGDP indicator in 
relation to quarterly GDP , the dataset has been expanded 
compared with the WAI to include other conventional eco -
nomic indicators.Deutsche Bundesbank

The short- term economic 
forecast for GDP growth 
from 2018 to 2023 in 
practice 
The use of forecasting models and expert as -
sessments in the practice of economic analysis 
is investigated using the example of the short- 
term forecasts for German GDP that were is -
sued twice a month between the first quarter 
of 2018 and the second quarter of 2023. The 
second quarter of 2023, for which the GDP 
growth rate was recently published, is dis -
cussed in greater detail in the box on pp. 72 ff. 
These illustrations offer a glimpse behind the 
scenes of the Bundesbank’s applied business 
cycle analysis and forecasting. They highlight, 
in particular, the problems faced by business 
cycle analysis during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The forecasts are presented in the same way as 
they were actually produced, amidst a continu -
ous influx of new information – i.e. in real time. 
Forecasts by economic experts are also shown 
alongside the model- based forecasts.36 The for -
mer notably incorporate expert knowledge 
gained through experience, and also informa -
tion on special factors that models do not cap -
ture sufficiently, or at all. This allows us to illus -
trate the composition of model- based forecasts 
and expert assessments under different eco -
nomic conditions.
After the German economy boomed with 
strong growth rates in 2017, GDP growth 
slowed significantly in 2018 and 2019. This 
weakening of growth was generally well pre -
dicted by the models. However, special factors 
caused some fluctuations, creating difficulties 
for both model- based forecasting and the ex -
perts’ business cycle analysis. These notably in -
cluded the difficulties faced by the German 
automotive industry with the changeover to a 
new EU- wide standard for measuring exhaust 
emissions in the summer of 2018.37 Over the 
course of 2019, however, the models then 
overstated the slowdown, producing signifi -
cantly negative growth rates pointing to eco -
nomic warning signs. Although the economic experts considered a technical recession, mean -
ing two consecutive quarters with negative 
GDP growth rates, to be possible in the course 
of the economic slowdown, they did not ex -
pect a recession in the sense of a significant, 
broad- based and persistent decline in eco -
nomic output with underutilised aggregate 
capacity.38 On the whole, the experts’ assess -
ments of economic developments in the years 
2018-19 were good, albeit a little too optimistic 
at times.
When the COVID-  19 pandemic reached Ger -
many in March 2020, it caused massive difficul -
ties for the forecasting models. The models 
only identified the very sharp drop in economic 
output with a significant lag, and even then 
they fell far short of capturing the actual mag -
nitude of the decline in GDP . In this situation, 
economists’ expert knowledge gained substan -
tially in importance. The experts responded 
more quickly to the possible economic impact 
of the COVID-  19 pandemic, performing a swift 
and substantial downward revision to their 
forecast for the first two quarters of 2020. Ul -
timately, they were remarkably successful at 
predicting the reported declines in GDP given 
their size and the high uncertainty. Information 
that was not included sufficiently, or at all, in 
classic forecasting models played an essential 
part in these assessments. This was particularly 
true of the pandemic situation and evaluations 
of the economic impact of containment meas -
ures. Here, estimates using heavily disaggre -Short- term fore -

36 Both the revised models and the new methods were 
integrated into applied business cycle analysis at varying 
points in time. For example, the WAI was developed shortly 
after the outbreak of the COVID-  19 pandemic and was al -
ready put into operation in the second quarter of 2020. 
Between the third quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 
2022, the bridge equation model was revised successively 
and integrated into day- to- day operations. The MGDP 
model has been in use since the beginning of 2022, while 
the revised VAR model has been in operation since the 
third quarter of 2022. The new factor model did not re -
place its predecessor in day- to- day business until the first 
quarter of 2023. For this reason, the model- based forecasts 
are derived partly from model variants that pre- date the 
changes and partly from those after them, i.e. each fore -
cast is as it was actually calculated at the time.

gated sectoral analyses of the relevant sectors 
became important, for example. Amongst 
other things, real- time high- frequency data, 
such as the truck toll index, were used for this 
purpose.39 The WAI also provided timely, fairly 
accurate signals about the current economic 
situation.40 Finally, the Bundesbank’s macroe -
conometric model41 was used to create alter -
native macroeconomic scenarios regarding the 
pandemic, which also included an estimation 
of their GDP effects via the expenditure com -
ponents.42
After the pandemic containment measures 
were eased, there were signs of a strong coun -termovement in the third quarter of 2020. 
Here, too, the models identified the recovery 
only slowly and on a smaller scale. By contrast, 
at an early stage, the experts already foresaw a 
sharp rise in GDP , aided, in particular, by the 
relevant signal from the WAI. As the pandemic 
continued, GDP growth no longer fluctuated 
quite so strongly. In the winter of 2020-21, the 
model forecasts diverged greatly. On the whole, 
however, their forecasts were much closer to … but under -

Business cycle analysis: an illustration based on the second 
quarter of 2023
In practice, the Bundesbank’s business cycle 
analysis for Germany is guided by the publi-
cation calendar for key indicators of eco-
nomic activity and sentiment. While hard 
economic indicators in the form of offi   cial 
statistics (mainly industrial data) are usually 
released in the second week of each month, 
soft indicators such as the ifo business cli-
mate index are generally published in the 
fourth week of every month. Accordingly, 
model forecasts and experts’ economic as-
sessments are updated twice a month.1 This 
box gives a detailed explanation of applied 
business cycle analysis based on the real- 
time forecasts produced by the revised 
short- term forecasting models and the ex-
pert assessment for the second quarter of 
2023.2At the beginning of February 2023, the 
underlying dynamics of the German econ-
omy were more robust than had been an-
ticipated in the Bundesbank’s December 
2022 projection.3 As a result, the Bundes-
bank’s economic experts initially forecasted 
a slightly positive growth rate (0.1%), pos-
itioning themselves still at the lower end of 
the spectrum in terms of the model fore-
casts. Two weeks later, with the publication 
of the national accounts details for the 
fourth quarter of 2022 by the Federal Stat-
istical Offi   ce, the corresponding GDP rate 
was also revised – to a more pronounced 
than previously reported decline, which al-
most matched the fi  gure from the Decem-
ber projection.4 On the other hand, surveys 
conducted by the ifo Institute showed a fur-
ther improvement in enterprises’ business 
expectations. Moreover, uncertainty about 
the energy supply declined steadily, and en-
ergy prices fell signifi  cantly.
In addition, at the beginning of March it be-
came apparent that there had been a strong 
countermovement in the manufacturing 
sector in January following the setback seen 
1 In addition, the weekly activity index for the German 
economy (WAI) is updated weekly on the Bundes-
bank’s website.
2 Following publication of the fl  ash estimate for the 
fourth quarter of 2022 at the beginning of February 
2023, the short- term forecast horizon was extended to 
include the second quarter of 2023. Until the publica-
tion of the corresponding GDP fl  ash estimate at the 
end of July, forecasts for the second quarter were 
thereafter prepared on a twice- monthly basis.
3 In the projection, a slight decline had been expected 
for the second quarter of 2023; see Deutsche Bundes-
bank (2022d).
4 However, this decline was driven by a broad- based, 
strong setback in many economic indicators in Decem-
ber. This was due not only to cyclical effects but also to 
temporary effects such as an exceptionally high level 
of sickness and unseasonably cold weather in the two 
weeks leading up to Christmas 2022.Short-term forecasts for Q2 2023

in December.5 This suggested that the Ger-
man economy might be recovering some-
what faster than previously expected. In 
this environment, the model forecasts for 
the second quarter increased. In line with 
this, the expert assessment was also revised 
up somewhat (to 0.2%).6
In April, it even looked as though German 
economic activity had not contracted again 
at the start of 2023, as previously expected, 
but could actually have grown somewhat. 
Industrial production, in particular, con-
tinued to rise steeply in February, and the 
decline in demand appeared to have been 
overcome as new orders rose strongly. 
Against the backdrop of well- fi  lled order 
books and easing supply bottlenecks, a 
temporary boost for industry was even con-
ceivable. At the time, however, the Bank’s 
economic experts did not yet react by revis-
ing up their forecast for the second quar-
ter.7
The Federal Statistical Offi   ce’s fl  ash estimate 
for GDP growth in the fi  rst quarter of 2023, 
which was published at the end of April, 
showed stagnating GDP and consequently 
fell slightly short of experts’ expectations. 
However, the exceptionally weak industrial 
data for March, which were published 
shortly afterwards, were much more sur-
prising. In particular, the sharp decline in 
new orders cast doubt on whether indus-
trial demand had, in fact, already bottomed 
out.8 In addition, ifo surveys showed a de-
terioration in the business climate. These 
new data caused a downright collapse in 
some model forecasts. By contrast, the 
WAI, which continued to indicate an ex-
pansion during this period, sent the oppos-
ite signal.
The expert assessment was also down-
graded at the beginning of May, but the 
forecast was lowered only slightly to 0.1%. One factor was that it was thought that the 
high order backlog and the easing of supply 
bottlenecks would further cushion the ef-
fects of weak demand on production.9 
Moreover, it still appeared likely that private 
consumption had bottomed out, as real dis-
posable incomes were probably no longer 
declining thanks to easing infl  ation and 
markedly rising wages. This appears also to 
have buoyed the services sector, for which 
survey results among businesses and pur-
chasing managers tended to be positive at 
the end of May. The fact that indicators re-
lating to the services sector tend to be un-
derrepresented in the short- term forecast-
ing models was another reason why a more 
positive view than that taken by the models 
seemed appropriate.10 The Bundesbank’s 
new macroeconomic projections, which 
5 The temporary factors that were likewise responsible 
for the setback in December evidently carried greater 
weight than initially thought. It is possible that fi  rms in 
the manufacturing sector halted their production 
sooner or for longer than usual in response to the high 
levels of sickness and high energy prices as well as the 
way the calendar fell with an unusually large number 
of working days around the holidays. In addition, the 
weather in January proved unusually mild, after much 
of December had been characterised by exceptionally 
unfavourable weather conditions. As a consequence, 
construction could have experienced catch- up effects 
as activity recovered and made up for lost time.
6 Given weak demand from abroad, ongoing high in-
fl  ation and further monetary policy tightening, a sig-
nifi  cant improvement was not yet in sight, however. 
See Deutsche Bundesbank (2023b).
7 One reason for the experts’ cautious attitude was 
that the ifo business climate index improved only 
slightly as the assessment of the current situation had 
deteriorated somewhat.
8 As a result, GDP growth for the fi  rst quarter of 2023 
was revised down noticeably (to -0.3%) with the pub-
lication of the national accounts details on 24 May.
9 According to data published at the beginning of 
June, industrial production in April remained almost 
unchanged from its March level, which had been re-
vised up, but was still depressed. In addition, industrial 
new orders continued to decline slightly. However, ac-
cording to non- offi   cial data from the German Associ-
ation of the Automotive Industry, car production rose 
sharply in May.
10 The same applies to government consumption, 
which is barely captured in short- term forecasting 
models. Following the decline in the fi  rst quarter, 
which was unexpectedly strong based on the data 
available at the time, a certain countermovement was 
expected in the second quarter.Deutsche Bundesbank

the realised GDP growth rates than at the start 
of the pandemic. The expert forecast was again 
quite accurate in that same period. In the 
spring of 2021, however, the economic experts 
somewhat overestimated the strength of the 
recovery after containment measures were 
eased, while the models tended to underesti -
mate it. One factor in the experts’ overesti -
mation was that they underestimated the sharp 
increase in supply bottlenecks for intermediate 
goods in many sectors at the time. At the end 
of 2021, by contrast, models and experts cor -
rectly gauged the impact of the renewed in -
tensification of the pandemic on the economy. 
In the first quarter of 2022, however, the ex -
perts remained overly pessimistic for a long 
time in view of ongoing restrictions, while the 
models overestimated the strength of the re -
covery.
The outbreak of Russia’s war of aggression 
against Ukraine in February 2022 led to a very 
high degree of uncertainty about economic de -velopments. The range of the model forecasts 
increased again sharply. Owing to the substan -
tial deterioration in business expectations, 
some models predicted a sharp economic 
downturn. Behind this lay concerns that, in 
particular, a halt in Russian gas supplies to Ger -
many could trigger massive disruptions in the 
energy markets, and possibly even mandated 
rationing. The Bundesbank initially took these 
risks into account by simulating adverse risk 
scenarios.43 At the same time, the experts’ 
baseline scenario remained fairly optimistic re -
garding the 2022 summer half-year, thus pre -
dicting the relatively robust development of the 
German economy rather well.
However, when it became apparent in the 
summer that Germany would need to get 
through the coming winter largely without 
Russian gas supplies, the outlook for the 
2022-2023 winter half-year deteriorated. The Strongly 
elevated  fore -
cast uncertainty 
with the out -
break of Russia’s 
war of aggres -
sion against 
Ukrainewere fi  nalised on 31 May, were also based 
on slight GDP growth for the second quar-
ter of 2023.11
Nor did this assessment for the second 
quarter change when a signifi  cantly gloom-
ier business climate indicator was published 
at the end of June, as this was driven fi  rst 
and foremost by business expectations re-
lating mainly to the third quarter. Surveys 
also signalled a further easing of supply 
bottlenecks both in industry and construc-
tion. Following the publication of the hard 
data at the beginning of July, most model 
forecasts improved somewhat. Industrial 
new orders rose sharply again, although the 
underlying trend was still downward- 
directed. Moreover, the labour market re-
mained stable. Therefore, the assessment 
that real GDP was likely to have risen slightly 
in the second quarter remained unchanged, 
with growth still at 0.1%. It was thus still somewhat above the range of the model 
forecasts.
At the end of July, the Federal Statistical Of-
fi  ce reported in its fl  ash estimate that GDP 
had stagnated in the second quarter of 
2023. This was slightly less than had previ-
ously been expected by economic experts. 
For the period from the beginning of Febru-
ary to the end of July as a whole, their as-
sessment was fairly stable, but somewhat 
too optimistic. By contrast, the models were 
initially signifi  cantly too optimistic and then 
much too pessimistic for a long time. These 
fl  uctuations were least pronounced in the 
bridge equation model.

models showed a considerable decline in eco -
nomic output, and the experts performed a 
large downward revision on their assessment. 
In the September Monthly Report, the experts 
warned of a heightened risk of recession.44 In 
the following months, however, it became in -
creasingly clear that the German economy 
would be better able to cope with the changed 
underlying conditions than initially feared. 
Nevertheless, the energy crisis constituted a 
substantial burden. The December projection 
therefore predicted a 0.6% decline in GDP in 
the fourth quarter of 2022. A further decline 
(of 0.3%) was expected for the first quarter of 
2023.45 In fact, the German economy per -
formed somewhat better in the winter than 
was assumed in December.46 The industrial sec -
tor withstood the energy crisis and the weak -
ening of demand thanks to diminishing supply 
bottlenecks and well- filled order books. Gas 
shortages became increasingly unlikely because 
of partly weather-related energy savings that 
were partly due to mild weather conditions, 
and increased (liquefied) gas deliveries. Accord -
ing to survey indicators, there was a wide -
spread decline in corporate pessimism about 
the future.
Conclusion: Forecasting 
models remain the most 
important  tool for business 
cycle analysis
An evaluation of the short- term forecasting 
models based on their forecast quality shows 
that, on average, the adjusted models provide 
informative forecasts of economic growth for 
the current quarter and, as the case may be, the 
quarter just ended (see the box on pp. 67 ff.). 
This applies both in the period from 2010 to 
2019 and in the period from 2010 to the first 
quarter of 2023. The adapted bridge equation 
model, which has the highest overall accuracy, 
also manages to achieve this for forecasts one 
quarter ahead. Moreover, having deteriorated 
massively with the onset of the pandemic, the 
accuracy of the model forecasts has improved again considerably since the end of 2020. The 
evaluation results thus underline the key role of 
the forecasting models as a valuable tool for ap -
plied business cycle analysis. At the same time, 
however, their accuracy has not yet returned to 
its pre-  pandemic level. Consequently, the ex -
pertise of the economists will probably continue 
to play a vital role for the foreseeable future.
As soon as the German economy enters a last -
ing calmer phase, the accuracy of the forecast -
ing models is likely to improve further. At the 
same time, the latest revisions do not mark the 
end of work on the short- term forecasting 
toolbox. Regular reviews and adjustments of 
the models are necessary in order to maintain 
their ability to perform under changing eco -
nomic conditions.
Technological progress also permits new data 
and methods to be utilised. For example, in the 
future, computer- based text analysis could 
make it possible to use media information to 
generate high- frequency economic indicators, 
which enable timely model- based recording of 
cyclical fluctuations.47 Newly available methods, 
e.g. in the field of machine learning and artifi -
cial intelligence, can also be incorporated into 
business cycle analysis and forecasting.48 Re-
viewing the suitability of these and other new 
data and methods for forecasting Germany’s 
GDP will remain an ongoing task.Following the

45 The direct effects of the energy crisis played a key role 
in the expectation of weakening economic activity, particu -
larly the loss of household purchasing power due to high 
inflation and the burden placed by high energy prices on 
the industrial sector. However, additional factors included 
braking effects from weak foreign demand for the export 
sector, dampened investment due to high uncertainty and 
increased financing costs, and a decline in government 
consumption as pandemic- related expenditure came to an 
end. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2022d).
46 The Federal Statistical Office initially reported a 0.2% 
decline in GDP for the fourth quarter of 2022 and stagna -
tion for the first quarter of 2023. The figures for both quar -
ters were later revised markedly; recent data show a fall in 
GDP for both quarters. The decline is still milder than was 
expected in the December projection, however.

Member States’ financial relationships with 
the EU budget and the NextGenerationEU 
off- budget entity in 2022
Last year, the EU budget amounted to €168 billion, or just over 1% of the European Union’s gross 
national income (EU GNI). Dedicated grants made up the bulk of this amount. For a time, the 
NextGenerationEU (NGEU) off- budget entity is also providing grants to Member States. These 
amounted to €62 billion, or just under ½% of EU GNI, in 2022.
The EU budget and NGEU fund a variety of expenditure items, the result being that financial 
resources are redistributed to lower- performing Member States (in terms of per capita GNI), which 
receive relatively large grants. At the same time, all Member States fund the EU roughly in pro -
portion to the size of their economies, with each making regular national contributions of just 
under 1% of their GNI to the EU budget. The NGEU grants, by contrast, are funded initially using 
loans taken out jointly. The plan is for these debts to be repaid out of the EU budget starting in 
2028, which is why the Member States are also financing NGEU roughly in line with their GNI 
shares.
Counting the EU budget and NGEU together, nine of the 27 Member States were net contributors 
in 2022, meaning that they paid in more than they received in grants. Relative to its GNI, Ger -
many’s net contribution was the highest, at just under 1%, followed by the net contributions 
made by the Netherlands and Sweden. Croatia (4% of national GNI) and Bulgaria (3½%) received 
the highest net grants. NGEU played a considerable part in the redistribution of financial resources. 
Excluding NGEU, the net contribution of Germany, say, would be just ½% of GNI.
The funds of the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), which forms part of NGEU, are flowing to 
Member States at different speeds. Across all countries, the European Commission disbursed just 
over one- quarter of the RRF grants planned up to 2026 in the first two years (2021 and 2022). 
While some countries have not yet requested any RRF funds, Spain, Croatia and Italy, for example, 
have already received 40% of the grants intended for them. Germany requested 8%, but no 
funds in 2022.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
A regular overview of the financial relationships 
between Member States and the EU forms part 
of the Bundesbank’s reporting on public 
finances.1 The European Commission usually 
reports on the financial flows of the previous 
year in the second half of each year. In addition 
to the EU budget, these include the financial 
flows of the temporary NGEU off- budget en -
tity. Amongst other things, this article presents 
the Member States’ resulting net contributions 
last year.2
Net contributions resulting 
from Member States’ finan -
cial relationships with the EU 
budget and NGEU
Each Member State’s net contribution is deter -
mined by the EU budget and NGEU. A positive 
net contribution means that the Member State 
is a net recipient – that is, it gets more out of 
the budget than it pays in. A negative one 
means that the Member State is a net contribu -
tor.
EU budget
Annual expenditure under the EU budget is 
agreed by Member States in a multiannual 
financial framework (MFF) covering a period of 
seven years. The current MFF runs from 2021 
to 2027, with the bulk of the expenditure going 
to Member States. Countries with a lower eco -
nomic performance (in terms of their per capita 
GNI) generally receive disproportionately high 
grants out of the EU budget. In addition, the 
EU budget covers administrative expenditure as 
well as grants to non- EU countries for develop -
ment or humanitarian aid, for example. Admin -
istrative expenditure is not included in the cal -
culation of net contributions.
Alongside customs duties, national contribu -
tions by Member States, also known as GNI-  based own resources, are by far the largest rev -
enue source for the EU budget. In addition, a 
smaller share comes from receipts collected by 
the European competition authority in the form 
of antitrust penalties or fines paid by Member 
States. Only Member States’ national contribu -
tions feed into the calculation of net contribu -
tions. Overall, they are very much based on the 
strength of each country’s economy, meaning 
that Member States pay roughly the same, rela -
tive to their GNI, into the EU budget.
NGEU
Member States agreed in 2020 to establish 
NGEU, an off-  budget entity, as a response to 
the economic challenges presented by the 
coronavirus pandemic. It will see grants total -
ling approximately €420 billion being disbursed 
to Member States between 2021 and 2026,3 
and also comprises loans of up to €390 billion 
to Member States. Unlike the EU budget, NGEU 
is initially being financed through joint borrow -
ing, rather than via national contributions. The 
borrowing Member States themselves are ser -
vicing the debt taken out for NGEU loans (inter -
est and principal payments). The debt taken 
out for the grants will have to be jointly repaid 
over time by all the Member States via the 
regular EU budget between 2028 and 2058. 
Member States have committed to making suf -
ficient funds available to the EU budget for this 
purpose. It is currently envisaged that Member 
States will continue to finance the EU budget 
largely in line with their GNI shares. For this 
reason, it makes sense to estimate Member 
States’ NGEU financing burdens and net contri -
butions based on their respective GNI shares, 
too. The net contribution calculated in this way Article outlines

cial relationships between Member States and the EU 
budget, including NGEU. A detailed description of the 
methodology can be found in Deutsche Bundesbank

ber States were already financing NGEU grants 
today out of national contributions to the regu -
lar EU budget.
The next section presents the net contributions 
to the EU budget and to NGEU calculated in 
this manner for 2022.
Developments in 2022
Total net contributions
Just like the EU budget, NGEU benefits lower-  
performing Member States. However, Member 
States do not request the funds allocated to 
them evenly over the years, which is why, at 
times, the NGEU net contributions fluctuate 
considerably from one year to the next. Look -
ing at the EU budget and NGEU together, nine 
of the 27 EU Member States were net contribu -
tors in 2022 (see the adjacent chart).4 Germany 
paid the most in net terms, at just under 1% of 
national GNI, followed by the Netherlands, 
Sweden, Ireland, Austria, Denmark, Finland, 
France and Belgium. In all these countries, 
NGEU added significantly to net payments. In 
most of the net contributor Member States (in -
cluding Germany), NGEU made up around half 
of the net contribution, even though NGEU 
was only half the size of the EU budget. This is 
because two large Member States – Italy and 
Spain – requested a particularly large portion of 
their allocated NGEU funds. In France, the in -
crease in the net contribution due to NGEU 
was less sizeable, while Belgium only became a 
net contributor as a result of NGEU.
The other 18 Member States were net recipi -
ents. Croatia and Bulgaria received the highest 
net grants relative to their national GNI, at 4% 
and just over 3½%, respectively. They were fol -
lowed by Latvia, Greece, Lithuania, Hungary, 
Estonia, Romania and Slovakia, which each re -
ceived more than 2% of GNI. In the large econ -
omies of Italy and Spain, NGEU accounted for 
a particularly large share of net grants. Italy would have been a net contributor were it not 
for NGEU, while Spain received significantly 
higher net grants from NGEU than from the 
EU  budget. In Slovenia, Luxembourg, Malta, 
Czechia, Poland and Hungary, net inflows from 
the EU budget contrasted with a (significantly 
smaller) net burden from NGEU.Nine countries

NGEU: grants disbursed at 
different  speeds
The Recovery and Resilience Facility is the 
centrepiece of NGEU, accounting for 80% of 
total grants. The remaining 20% of NGEU 
grants are being used to reinforce existing pro -
grammes funded by the EU budget. Viewed 
cumulatively over the entire horizon, RRF funds 
are disproportionately allocated, by agreement, 
to lower- performing Member States. However, 
Member States need to satisfy certain require -
ments to obtain the RRF funds allocated to 
them. To this end, they have each agreed na -tional Recovery and Resilience Plans (RRPs) with 
the European Commission, which set out the 
milestones each country has to achieve. Coun -
tries can request up to 13% of their allocated 
grants and loans as pre- financing without 
monitoring to begin with. If a Member State 
requests additional funds, it must demonstrate 
that it has achieved the agreed milestones. 
Only then can the European Commission dis -
burse the funds.
The year 2022 saw NGEU grants worth €62 bil -
lion in total being disbursed to Member States 
(€47 billion thereof out of the RRF). That 
equates to just under ½% of EU GNI and was 
€8 billion up on the previous year. NGEU grants 
differed significantly across Member States (see 
the adjacent chart). Only 12 of the 27 Member 
States received RRF grants, with Croatia and 
Bulgaria obtaining the most, in relative terms, 
at 2% and 1.7% of GNI, respectively. They were 
followed by Italy, Spain and Greece at between 
0.8% and 1.0% of GNI. Finland requested only 
the pre- financing, at 0.1% of GNI.
Cross- country divergences in the disbursement 
of RRF grants widened again in 2022 (see the 
left- hand chart on p. 83). In total, the European 
Commission disbursed 28% of the total funds 
in the first two years of the six- year RRF term. 
Romania, France, Spain, Croatia and Italy have 
already had between 30% and just over 40% 
of their funds disbursed to them. With the ex -
ception of France, these countries are entitled 
to a disproportionately large share of RRF funds 
relative to GNI. To date, five countries have re -
ceived no RRF grants whatsoever, including 
Hungary and Poland, which have likewise been 
assigned a disproportionately large volume of 
RRF funds. Hitherto, payment of their funds has 
been suspended by the European Commission 
owing to breaches of the principles of the rule 
of law. By the end of 2022, four countries, in -
cluding Germany, had only requested the pre-  
financing.RRF subject

development steady
The EU budget for 2022 comprised expend -
iture of around €168 billion,5 which equates to 
just over 1% of EU GNI. Of this, just over €10 
billion was accounted for by administrative ex -
penditure, which is not factored into the calcu -
lation of net contributions. This item’s share 
remained unchanged at 6% of total expend -
iture. Another item that is disregarded is ex -
penditure on servicing NGEU debt. This has 
only comprised interest payments to date and 
was still negligible, at €47 million. Expenditure 
of €24 billion was covered by customs revenue, which is likewise excluded from the calculation 
of net contributions. The recovery in the econ -
omy meant that this item was €3 billion higher 
than in 2021.
Operating expenditure (expenditure net of ad -
ministration and NGEU debt service) came to 
€157 billion in 2022. As usual, cohesion policy 
expenditure made up the largest share, fol -
lowed by agricultural policy expenditure. These 
two categories combined accounted for more 
than two- thirds of expenditure. The remaining 
€38 billion was distributed across the areas of EU budget of 
€168bn in 2022

research and infrastructure, external action, 
and security and citizenship. As in previous 
years, there was significant variation in the level 
of grants paid to Member States out of the EU 
budget (see the right- hand chart on p.  83). 
Hungary received the highest relative amount, 
at just over 3½% of GNI, while Germany, Swe -
den and the Netherlands had the lowest, at 
just under ½%.
As usual, Member States’ payments into the EU 
budget, measured in terms of 2022 GNI, were 
much closer to each other than the grants they 
received (see the above chart). These payments 
covered €130 billion of expenditure. Expressed 
as an (unweighted) average, Member States 
paid just over 0.8% of their GNI into the EU 
budget. The range between the countries with 
the lowest and highest payments (relative to 
GNI) was 0.3 percentage point.Redistribution via EU budget 
and NGEU following similar 
pattern
Via the EU budget, Member States typically re -
distribute financial resources from higher-  
performing countries to lower- performing 
ones. This tendency is also evident in the cur -
rent MFF and in the total assigned NGEU grants 
(see the charts on p. 85). On average over the 
first two years, all net contributors to the EU 
budget, with the exception of Italy, had a 
higher per capita GNI than the EU average. 
Conversely, the per capita GNI of the net recipi -
ents, with the exception of Luxembourg,6 was 
below the EU average in the same period.
Conclusion
The EU budget redistributes financial resources 
from higher- performing EU Member States to 
lower- performing ones primarily on the ex -
penditure side. That is also the declared object -
ive of the EU’s cohesion policy, for example. 
NGEU follows the same principle of redistribu -
tion and increases its scale.
Because Member States are funding NGEU 
grants by borrowing via an off- budget entity, 
they are shifting their respective financing bur -
dens into the future. Neither their deficits nor 
their general government debt levels (as de -
fined by Maastricht in each case) reflect these 
burdens. However, any analysis of public 
finances should already take these future bur -
dens into account today – for example, when 
calculating fiscal sustainability. It would be lo -
gical to also give timely consideration to these 
financing burdens as part of the reform of the Much less

6 Luxembourg receives comparatively high payments, rela -

Europe research programme. In 2022, payments under this 
programme amounted to just under 1% of GNI, which was 
almost as high as Luxembourg’s total payments into the EU 
budget. In 2021, the inflow came to 0.5% of Luxembourg’s 
GNI, which was likewise well above the European average. 
By comparison, the other Member States receive less than 
0.1% of their GNI on average under this programme.Deutsche Bundesbank

The performance of German credit 
institutions  in 2022
German credit institutions’ performance tended to deteriorate over the course of 2022. Profit for 
the financial year before tax did manage to creep up on aggregate (+1.4%) and, at €27.4 billion, 
it remained well above the long- term average. This was, however, largely due to a one- off effect 
at one institution belonging to the category of big banks which clearly improved the other and 
extraordinary result. Without this one- off effect, aggregate profit for the financial year before tax 
would have been down on 2021. The rise in interest rates had a rather mixed impact on the indi -
vidual categories of banks, with the majority recording lower profit for the 2022 financial year 
than in 2021.
Overall, the interest rate hikes in 2022 had both a positive and a negative impact on earnings. On 
the one hand, these hikes were instrumental in improving the net interest income of German 
banks as a whole in the reporting year. The exceptionally steep increase of 11.4% chiefly came 
about on the back of lending rates rising at a faster and stronger pace than deposit rates. Net 
interest income thus proved to be the main force behind the considerable rise in operating income 
(+11.8%). By contrast, net commission income remained at the previous year’s level and, unlike 
in 2021, played no part in boosting operating income.
On the other hand, interest rate hikes in 2022 caused net valuation charges to shoot up to almost 
four and a half times the previous year’s figure; at €16.2 billion, they were also well above the 
long- term average. This was mainly due to high write- downs on fixed- income securities and 
increased risk provisioning in lending business. In addition, general administrative spending also 
went up by 3.3% compared with 2021. Together with higher net valuation charges, this more 
than offset the increase in operating income.
In the current year, high inflation rates, the tightening of monetary policy and elevated uncer -
tainty about economic developments continue to shape German credit institutions’ business 
environment. Against this background, it remains to be seen to what extent the continued rise in 
interest rates will bolster the performance of German institutions in the medium term. Overall, 
risks that drag on earnings are on the rise: the increase in the interest margin in lending and 
deposit business, which played a major role in improving net interest income in 2022, is unlikely 
to be sustainable if the expected competitive pressure pushes up interest rates on customer 
deposits. A decline in new lending business and an increase in credit defaults are expected to 
weigh on banks’ performance in the next few years.Deutsche Bundesbank

Business environment and 
structural developments in 
the German banking sector
2022 proved another challenging year for Ger -
man credit institutions. While the coronavirus 
pandemic eased its hold on the macroeco -
nomic environment as the year progressed, 
Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, 
supply bottlenecks, energy supply risks and 
high inflation took their toll on the German 
economy.1 With consumer prices soaring, the 
Eurosystem also ended the eight- year period of 
negative interest rates in the summer of 2022.
For the German banking sector, it was the low 
interest rate period coming to an end that had 
the greatest positive effect on earnings. How -
ever, the changed business environment also 
affected vulnerabilities that had been building 
up in recent years in the context of low interest 
rates and low inflation.2 Interest rate risk, in 
particular, materialised to a significant extent 
over the course of 2022, with a negative im -
pact on performance. By contrast, credit risk 
initially did not emerge across the board. As 
was the case during the coronavirus pandemic, 
German fiscal policy again made a vital contri -
bution to stabilisation in the challenging busi -
ness environment of 2022. Overall, the German 
banking system remained robust and continued 
to perform its functions unimpaired in the re -
porting year.3
Macroeconomic setting
Real growth of gross domestic product (GDP) 
in Germany, at a calendar-  adjusted 1.9%, was 
considerably weaker than expected at the be -
ginning of the year.4 After the coronavirus re -
strictions were lifted, 2022 saw German eco -
nomic output rise above its pre- COVID level for 
the first time. Russia’s war of aggression against 
Ukraine, however, hit the Germany economy 
hard. In particular, uncertainty about the en -
ergy supply and its costs, increased supply 
bottlenecks and consumer prices, which saw their fastest rise in 70 years, weighed on indus -
try and consumers. This ultimately also had a 
knock-  on effect on the macroeconomic envir -
onment in Germany’s banking sector.
Against the background of uncertainty regard -
ing the energy supply and high inflation, the 
Bundestag adopted government support meas -
ures for enterprises and households. These in -
cluded payments to gas trading companies, the 
electricity and gas price brakes and the exemp -
tion of employers’ “inflation compensation bo -
nuses” from taxes and social contributions. This 
bolstered economic developments in 2022 des -
pite the simultaneous phasing- out of govern -
ment support measures from the coronavirus 
pandemic.
Overall, the fiscal policy measures are also likely 
to have helped keep the non- performing loan 
ratio at an unremarkable level.5 Against this 
backdrop, the assumptions underlying banks’ 
risk assessments may have been overly optimis -
tic, a concern recently expressed in the Bundes -
bank’s 2022 Financial Stability Review.6 As a 
result, banks could underestimate the risks of 
credit defaults and interest rate changes, and 
overestimate the value of loan collateral such 
as real estate. This could give rise to an unex -
pected strain on performance in the future. In 
order to strengthen the resilience of the Ger -
man banking sector, the Federal Financial 
Supervisory Authority (BaFin) therefore an -
nounced a package of macroprudential meas -
ures as early as January 2022.7

monetary policy. In order to bring inflation 
rates back down to the medium- term target, 
net asset purchases under the pandemic emer -
gency purchase programme (PEPP) were dis -
continued in March 2022 as planned. Net asset 
purchases under the asset purchase programme 
(APP) followed suit at the beginning of July 
2022. In addition, key interest rates were raised 
significantly by a total of 2.5 percentage points 
in several steps up to the close of the year. This 
also ended the eight- year period of negative 
interest rates. The deposit facility rate was put 
up from -0.5% to 2.0% in the period from July 
to December 2022, returning it to its level from 
the end of 2008. In addition, in October 2022, 
as part of monetary policy normalisation, inter -
est rates and other conditions for the third ser -
ies of targeted longer- term refinancing oper -
ations (TLTRO III) were also adjusted.8
International equity markets have declined sig -
nificantly since the beginning of 2022. Rising 
long- term interest rates in many countries and 
uncertainties about economic developments, 
which intensified up to the third quarter, 
weighed on prices. Falling prices immediately 
after war broke out in Ukraine hit stock ex -
changes in Europe – including in Germany – 
the hardest. This reflected European countries’ 
dependency on Russian commodities, in par -
ticular natural gas. However, since the end of 
the third quarter of 2022, both the inter -
national and the European equity markets have 
recorded some significant gains. This was due, 
in particular, to better- than- expected economic 
developments. In the euro area, reports of size -
able deliveries of liquid gas and high gas stor -
age levels also eased uncertainty about the en -
ergy supply. As a result, European equity indices 
rose substantially more strongly than, for ex -
ample, equity prices in the United States.9
Nominal government bond yields rose very sig -
nificantly in the bond markets of major cur -
rency areas over the course of the year. This 
was also true of yields on ten- year Federal 
securities which, at more than 2.6% at the end 
of December 2022, reached their highest level in more than ten years.10 This development is 
likely to have been driven mainly by two fac -
tors. First, given the persistently high inflation 
rates, market participants expected a further 
tightening of monetary policy. Second, there 
was an increase in the term premia that invest -
ors demanded as compensation for assuming 
price risks when purchasing long- term bonds. 
The termination of the Eurosystem’s net pur -
chases is likely to have contributed to this.11
Balance sheet and structural 
developments in the German 
banking sector
The consolidation process in the German bank -
ing sector continued in 2022. Over the course 
of the year, the overall number of credit institu -
tions fell by 61 to 1,395. The decline was thus 
somewhat higher than in the previous year and 
was mainly attributable to mergers, largely 
among credit cooperatives.12
The number of domestic branches also con -
tinued to fall significantly. At around 6%, how -
ever, the decline was somewhat smaller than in 
the previous year (2021: around -10%). Once 
again, this development is likely to reflect both 
the impact of digitalisation as online banking 
becomes more prevalent and cost- cutting 
measures in an environment of intense compe -
tition.13Monetary policy

TLTRO III were indexed to the average applicable key ECB 
interest rates over this period. Banks were also offered 
three voluntary early repayment dates. See Deutsche

considered credit institutions and 43 UK branches were dis -
solved as a result of Brexit) amounted to 46 institutions.

German credit institutions’ average aggregate 
total assets14 for the year continued to grow in 
2022, although the Eurosystem tightened its 
monetary policy considerably. At 12.0%, the 
growth rate was more than four times the 
year- on- year level.15 Brexit is also likely to have 
continued to play a role in this regard:16 almost 
half of the increase in the aggregate total 
assets in the reporting year was attributable to 
the balance sheet growth of regional and other 
commercial banks (+37.1%). The latter was 
driven mainly by the merger of one institution 
with foreign business units that had not been 
recorded in the data previously. This institution 
was responsible for more than 85% of the bal -
ance sheet growth of regional and other com -
mercial banks and just under 40% of the 
growth of aggregate total assets. In addition, 
big banks also expanded their total assets by 
10.4%, after having recorded a decline of 
around the same amount in 2021. Big banks 
thus contributed just under one- quarter to the 
growth in average aggregate total assets for the year in 2022. By contrast, savings banks 
and credit cooperatives recorded growth of 
3.8% and 5.1% in their respective total assets 
in 2022, slower than in the previous year (2021: 
+7.7% in each case).
With regard to the assets side of the aggre -
gated bank balance sheet, balances with the 
central bank, the main driver of growth in 
2021, did not contribute to growth in the re -
porting year, according to data from the

under TLTRO III, ended the growth trend of pre -
vious years. The repayment of the first two ma -
turing series of TLTRO III and the early repay -
ment of other series, some that were still on -
going, were chiefly responsible for the decrease 
in balances in the reporting year. Overall, Ger -
man banks’ liabilities to the Eurosystem fell by 
around 9%. Furthermore, in September 2022, 
German banks transferred large amounts from 
their current accounts with the central bank to 
the deposit facility, as balances exceeding the 
minimum reserve requirement were no longer 
remunerated as of September 2022. By con -
trast, as a result of monetary policy tightening, 
the interest rate on the deposit facility rose sim -
ultaneously to 0.75% and then gradually fur -
ther.17
Unlike central bank balances, lending con -
tinued to be a significant factor in driving 
growth on the assets side of the aggregated 
bank balance sheet in the reporting year. Ger -
man credit institutions once again expanded 
their domestic lending strongly, although inter -
est rates on loans rose sharply over the course 
of the year. At 5.4%, annual average growth 
not only exceeded the previous year’s figure 
(+3.2%) significantly, it also recorded the high -
est growth rate in the past 20 years. In particu -
lar, lending to the German private sector, i.e. 
domestic non- financial corporations and 
households, rose steeply during the first three 
quarters of 2022. Growth did not weaken sig -
nificantly until the fourth quarter. However, this 
was, to some extent, a countermovement to 
the exceptionally high growth in the preceding 
quarters, buoyed by government stabilisation 
measures to address uncertainty about the en -
ergy supply.18
Short- term loans to domestic non- financial cor -
porations and households recorded the strong -
est growth (+19.4%). Non- financial corpor -
ations, in particular, already had high financing 
needs related to inventories and working cap -
ital at the beginning of 2022 owing to supply 
chain problems and material shortages that 
have existed since the coronavirus pandemic. As of the end of the first quarter of 2022, non- 
financial corporations’ financing needs and 
thus demand for credit continued to increase. 
The main reasons are likely to have been the 
additional uncertainty caused by the war in 
Ukraine and its economic consequences, the 
hedging against rising interest rates and the 
further rise in inflation.19 In the third quarter of 
2022, a one- off effect also boosted lending to 
enterprises: a large portion of net lending was 
attributable to government assistance loans to 
energy companies that were granted directly 
by the Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW).20
In addition to short-  term loans, medium and 
long- term loans to domestic non- financial cor -
porations and households also grew signifi -
cantly in the reporting year. Loans to house -
holds for house purchase were again the main 
driver of this growth. At an annual average of 
6.6%, however, their expansion was somewhat 
smaller than in 2021 (+7.1%). From the third 
quarter of 2022 onwards, growth in loans for 
house purchase progressively weakened, after 
the growth trend of the previous year had ini -
tially continued in the first half of 2022. The 
general loss of purchasing power as a result of 
inflation, considerably higher construction 
prices, and the rise in financing costs damp -
ened households’ demand for loans for house 
purchase. In addition, given the rise in credit 
default risk, banks further tightened their credit 
conditions substantially for new lending and 
significantly increased their rejection rate.21
A comparison across the various categories of 
banks reveals a mixed picture. While big banks 
expanded their loans for house purchase at an 
annual average of 4.4%, much less than in the 
previous year (2021: +6.6%), for savings banks 
and credit cooperatives growth continued al -
most unabated. At 7.6% and 8.5%, respect -Lending to 
non-banks grew 
strongly again

Methodological notes
The results from the profi  t and loss ac-
counts are based on the published annual 
reports of the individual institutions in ac-
cordance with the provisions set forth in 
the German Commercial Code ( Handels-
gesetzbuch) and the Regulation on the Ac-
counting of Credit Institutions (Verordnung 
über die Rechnungslegung der Kreditinsti-
tute). In terms of their conception, structure 
and defi  nitions, they differ from the Inter-
national Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS)1 for publicly traded banking groups. 
This means that – from a methodological 
viewpoint – business performance and cer-
tain balance sheet or individual profi  t and 
loss items are not comparable across the 
national and international accounting 
frameworks. For reasons of comparability 
within Germany, it is advisable to consider 
the individual accounts when analysing 
fi  nancial performance. The fi  gures for bal-
ance sheet capital (total equity), total assets 
and other stock variables are not obtained 
from the annual reports but are taken as 
annual average values on the basis of the 
monthly balance sheet statistics reported 
for the institution as a whole.
The reporting group for profi  t and loss stat-
istics includes all banks which are monetary 
fi  nancial institutions (MFIs) that conform to 
the defi  nition of a CRR credit institution as 
set forth in Article 4(1) number 1 of Regula-
tion (EU) No 575/ 2013 and are domiciled in 
Germany. Branches of foreign banks that 
are exempted from the provisions of Sec-
tion 53 of the German Banking Act (Kredit-
wesengesetz, or KWG), banks in liquidation 
and banks with a fi  nancial year of less than 
twelve months (truncated fi  nancial year) are 
not included in this performance analysis.At the launch of monetary union in 1999, 
the reporting group relevant for calculating 
the money supply and for monetary analy-
sis was uniformly defi  ned by the European 
Central Bank (ECB) for the euro area as a 
whole and designated as the MFI sector. 
Unlike the population of banks used for the 
Bundesbank’s analysis up to that point, 
building and loan associations are also in-
cluded. Except where another time period 
is explicitly mentioned, the calculations with 
regard to the longer- term average cover the 
years since the launch of monetary union, 
i.e. from 1999 to 2022.
1 IFRS- based fi  nancial statements are of relevance, for 
instance, to matters of macroprudential analysis and 
oversight, concentrating on systemically important 
banks and their international business activities (includ-
ing their foreign subsidiaries). For details, see Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2013).Deutsche Bundesbank

ively, the growth rate of loans for house pur -
chase at savings banks and credit cooperatives 
was only slightly below the previous year’s fig -
ures (2021: +7.7% and +8.8%, respectively).
On the liabilities side of the aggregated bank 
balance sheet, the volume of deposits held by 
domestic non- banks with German credit insti -
tutions reached a new historical high of around 
€4,097 billion in 2022. However, at 3.6%, the 
average growth rate for the year was lower 
than in 2021, and was more at the level of the 
long- term average of 3.5%. The pace of growth 
fluctuated considerably in some cases in the 
course of 2022. For example, non- financial cor -
porations and households significantly ex -
panded their deposits with German banks, par -
ticularly in the first and third quarters of the 
reporting year. By contrast, growth was less 
dynamic in the second and fourth quarters of 
2022. Uncertainty about the effects of the Rus -
sian war of aggression against Ukraine and the 
marked deterioration in the economic outlook 
are likely to have initially contributed to an in -
crease in liquidity holdings.22 Over the course 
of the year, however, market players are likely 
to have become more aware of the high op -
portunity costs of holding money in an environ -
ment of high inflation rates and rising interest 
rates. Together with rising expenditure on 
intermediate and consumer goods, this is likely 
to have subdued growth in deposits.23
Against this backdrop, the volume of sight de -
posits held by domestic non- banks with Ger -
man credit institutions grew at a significantly 
slower pace overall than in the previous year. 
At 4.0%, the growth rate in 2022 was less than 
half of the previous year’s figure. By contrast, 
the holdings of time deposits rose by 6.6% in 
the reporting year, following on from a con -
tinuous decline over the past ten years. A com -
parison of the various categories of banks 
shows high growth, especially in the case of 
Landesbanken (+31.3%) and savings banks 
(+20.1%). However, time deposits also rose 
sharply at around 12% for both big banks and 
credit cooperatives.The strong growth was mainly concentrated on 
short- term time deposits. Both non-  financial 
corporations and households increasingly 
shifted their sight deposits, short- term savings 
deposits and longer- term time and savings de -
posits into short- term time deposits, as interest 
rates on these deposits rose far more sharply 
than interest rates on other forms of deposit in 
the course of 2022.24

than three times as high as in 2021.25 Growth 
in the balance sheet equity of regional and 
other commercial banks (around +16%), in par -
ticular, was far above average.26 At around 7%, 
however, the equity capital of credit coopera -
tives also recorded above-  average growth, 
while savings banks, at just under 4%, fell short 
of the aggregate level. By contrast, the balance 
sheet equity of big banks slipped by around 
1%.
Performance, profitability 
and cost efficiency
According to data from the statistics on banks’ 
profit and loss accounts,27 the aggregate profit 
for the financial year before tax generated by 
German credit institutions was slightly up on 
the year. Nevertheless, the performance of Ger -
man banks tends to have deteriorated in 2022. 
Ultimately, the rise in aggregate profit was 
mainly driven by a one- off effect at one par -
ticular big bank. The institution in question 
registered high income from value readjust -
ments to participating interests and shares in 
affiliated enterprises in the reporting year, 
which significantly bolstered the balance in the 
other and extraordinary account. Without this 
improvement, aggregate profit for the year be -
fore tax would have been lower than in 2021.
The much higher level of interest rates brought 
about by monetary policy tightening exerted 
both positive and negative effects on earnings. 
On the one hand, the rise in interest rates was 
instrumental in improving net interest income, 
which in turn was the driving force behind the 
significant increase in operating income. On 
the other hand, high write- downs on fixed-  
income securities, in particular, as well as in -
creased risk provisioning requirements in lend -
ing business meant German banks’ net valu -
ation charges climbed sharply in 2022. These 
opposing effects of higher interest rates im -
pacted the performance of the individual cat -
egories of banks to different degrees. In add -
ition, there was also a moderate rise in general administrative spending compared with 2021. 
Combined with the increase in net valuation 
charges, this more than offset the improve -
ment in operating income.
Profit for the financial year
Overall, German credit institutions increased 
their aggregate profit for the year before tax28 
by 1.4% in 2022, reaching €27.4 billion. Com -
ing after 2021, a year in which profit almost 
doubled, the reporting year thus saw only 
slight growth. Overall it was still well above the 
long- term average of €18.4 billion, however.
Unlike in 2021, the increase in the aggregate 
net profit for the reporting year was not 
founded on a broad- based improvement in an -
nual results across all the categories of banks 
looked at. The much higher level of interest 
rates brought about by monetary policy tight -
ening, in particular, exerted both positive and 
negative effects on earnings; as expected, 
these effects manifested in very different ways Balance sheet

25 This development is likely to have been partly driven by 
the improvement in performance in 2021, with German 
credit institutions almost doubling their profit for the finan -
cial year before tax compared with 2020. When interpret -
ing the data on the equity base, it should be borne in mind 
that the amounts transferred from the profit for the re -
spective financial year do not increase balance sheet equity 
until the year after the annual accounts are adopted, while 
withdrawals from equity items are to be deducted at the 
latest when the annual accounts are prepared.
26 In addition to the improvement in performance in 2021, 
the aforementioned merger at one institution belonging to 
the category of regional and other commercial banks is 
likely to have been the main driver of this increase. How -
ever, Brexit is also likely to have continued to play a role.

Commercial Code ( Handelsgesetzbuch;  HGB)), which the 
banks must submit to the Bundesbank pursuant to Sec -
tion 26 of the German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz) . As 
the annual accounts apply to the whole institution (but not 
to the group), the charges and income of foreign branches 
are also recorded. See also the box on methodological 
notes on p. 92.

in the individual categories of banks.29 In 2022, 
big banks, the Landesbanken and the building 
and loan associations were the only groupings 
that managed to increase their profit for the 
year before tax. The significant growth posted 
by Landesbanken and building and loan associ -
ations was based on a comparatively low level 
in the previous year30 and hardly had any bear -
ing on the improvement in net profit for the 
year at the aggregate level. For the big banks 
the story was quite a different one: in particular 
the huge €7.7 billion increase in their result for 
the financial year was a main driver of the 
growth seen overall. Having booked a loss in 
2021, big banks thus achieved a profit for the 
year before tax of €6.1 billion for the 2022 re -
porting year. That said, around two- thirds of 
the increase was attributable to the balance of 
the other and extraordinary account, which ex -
hibited strong improvement primarily due to 
one institution’s income from value readjust -
ments to participating interests, shares in affili -ated enterprises and securities treated as fixed 
assets.
The other categories of banks considered,31 es-
pecially mortgage banks, credit cooperatives 
and savings banks, saw their profit for the year 
before tax decline markedly in some cases. The 
drop experienced by mortgage banks, amount -
ing to just under 70%, was mainly due to a 
sharp reduction in the balance of the other and 
extraordinary account and was not caused by 
the rise in interest rates. Profit for the year be -
fore tax also fell steeply at credit cooperatives 
and savings banks in the reporting year, con -
tracting by 41.2% and 21.1% respectively. In Major income and cost items for individual categories of banks in 2022p

both cases, the decline was mainly attributable 
to net valuation charges, which rose signifi -
cantly compared with 2021 as a result of the 
higher interest rate level.
Operating income and its components
In 2022, operating income32 provided a par -
ticularly strong boost to growth in profit for the 
year before tax. In the reporting year, German 
credit institutions’ operating income rose by 
€14.9 billion (+11.8%) – more than twice as 
strongly as in the previous year, both in abso -
lute and relative terms. The improvement in op -
erating income was driven mainly by a sharp 
rise in net interest income, but a significant in -
crease in net trading income also played a part.
In contrast to the previous year, all categories 
of banks included in the analysis recorded 
higher operating income in 2022. Savings 
banks and credit cooperatives recorded the 
highest growth in absolute terms, with in -creases of €4.8 billion and €2.1 billion respect -
ively.33 Taken together, these two categories of 
banks were thus responsible for almost half of 
the total increase in operating income. How -
ever, big banks and Landesbanken also made 
significant contributions to the overall growth, 
with their operating income rising by €1.6 bil -
lion and €1.3 billion respectively.
Net interest income remained the most import -
ant source of revenue for German banks. It ac -
counted for around 65% of operating income 
– the same share as in 2021. Overall, German 
banks’ operating business benefited from the 
end of the multi- year period of low interest 
rates. The significantly higher interest rate level 
as a result of monetary policy tightening was 
the key factor leading to a considerable in -
crease in net interest income. At 11.4%, the 
growth rate of net interest income was more 
than eight times the prior- year figure. In add -
ition, net interest income contributed just over 
60% to the increase in operating income and 
was thus the largest driver of growth there.
Unlike in 2021, around 90% of the increase in 
the reporting year was attributable to net inter -
est income in the narrower sense, i.e. the con -
tribution to earnings by interest- related busi -
ness. Up by 11.9%, net interest income in the 
narrower sense actually grew somewhat more 
strongly than net interest income overall. Cur -
rent income from shares and other variable-  
yield securities, as well as from participating 
interests, which are likewise included in net 
interest income, also increased. In contrast to 
the previous year, however, it made only a 
small contribution to growth in 2022.Operating

33 The very sizeable increase of €3.7 billion in the operat -

partly due to the growth of one institution in this category 
following mergers with foreign business units.Deutsche Bundesbank

Overall, net interest income improved on a 
broad basis. Almost all categories of banks34 re-
corded strong growth for the most part. Big 
banks (+16.5%) and savings banks (+16.0%) 
saw especially strong increases.35 Credit co -
operatives saw a less significant rise, mean -
while, with net interest income up 9.2%
However, the interest margin (net interest in -
come in relation to average total assets for the 
year) fell again slightly overall in the reporting 
year, down by 0.01 percentage point to a new 
low of 0.86%. Aggregate average total assets 
for the year rose so strongly in 2022 that the 
improvement in net interest income ultimately 
failed to bring about an increase in the interest 
margin overall.
However looking at the categories of banks in 
isolation reveals sizeable differences between 
them. Savings banks and credit cooperatives, in 
particular, significantly increased their interest 
margins by 0.16 percentage point and 0.06 per -
centage point, respectively, compared with 
2021. In addition, at 1.47% and 1.53% respect -
ively, the interest margins they generated con -
tinued to be the highest out of all the categor -
ies of banks considered. By contrast, the inter -
est margin of the big banks only amounted to 
0.67%, despite them recording an improve -
ment of 0.04 percentage point. Regional and 
other commercial banks posted the largest de -
cline (-0.17 percentage point) among the cat -
egories of banks considered.36 At 0.84%, their 
interest margin was nevertheless higher than 
that of the big banks.
The growth in net interest income was gener -
ally due to the fact that interest received rose 
more strongly than interest paid. In absolute 
terms, interest income in the narrower sense, 
in particular, rose by a total of €34.6 billion 
(+28.4%) in the reporting year. Interest ex -
penditure, meanwhile, went up by €26.0 bil -
lion (+52.6%).37
The altered interest rate environment in the 
wake of monetary policy tightening is likely to have been the key cause of this development. 
Interest rates on new loans, especially in the 
high- growth housing loans segment, went up 
very quickly and unexpectedly sharply amid 
fast- paced credit growth.38 By contrast, interest 
rates on overnight deposits, which, according 
to monthly balance sheet statistics, accounted 
for around two- thirds of the total annual aver -Interest margin

34 Big banks, regional and other commercial banks, 
Landes banken, savings banks, credit cooperatives, and 
building and loan associations increased their net interest 
income. Branches of foreign banks, mortgage banks, and 
banks with special, development and other central support 
tasks were the only ones to see slight declines.
35 Regional banks and other commercial banks also re -
corded a substantial rise in net interest income of 14.3%. 
However, mergers with foreign business units at one insti -
tution in particular are likely to have fuelled that increase.
36 The exceptionally strong growth in average total assets 
for the year driven by merger activity exerted a negative 
impact on the interest margin of regional and other com -
mercial banks, which outweighed the positive effect of the 
rise in net interest income.
37 In a long- term comparison, interest income in the nar -

from refinancing operations with the Euro -
system.

strongly than interest expenditure. However, Interest received and interest paid by credit institutions

to such holdings. According to the Bundesbank’s Annual

there are some significant differences when it 
comes to the size of those increases. In particu -
lar, the big banks and regional and other com -
mercial banks recorded considerably higher 
growth rates for both interest income and 
interest expenditure compared with the aggre -
gate across all categories of banks. By contrast, 
savings banks and credit cooperatives saw their 
interest income grow less strongly than the fig -
ure for all categories put together. Credit co -
operatives’ interest expenditure remained virtu -
ally the same as in 2021. Savings banks reduced 
their interest expenditure by around one- fifth.
These differences are likely to ultimately be due 
to divergent business models. On the one 
hand, long interest rate fixation periods mean 
that the low interest rates on loans for house 
purchase in recent years are likely to have re -
mained the determining factor for interest in -
come in the reporting year for savings banks 
and credit cooperatives in particular. These in -
stitutions had some time to wait before the 
sharp increases in interest rates on loans for 
house purchase from the start of 2022 on -
wards had a positive effect on earnings through 
new business. According to the monthly bal -
ance sheet statistics, savings banks and credit 
cooperatives respectively accounted for around 
33% and around 25% of the total average 
stock of housing loans in 2022. Big banks only 
accounted for around 15% of this loan cat -
egory, while regional and other commercial 
banks held a small share of just under 8% of 
the total stock.
On the other hand, the very slow pace of in -
creases in interest rates for overnight deposits44 
is likely to have been the key factor in curbing 
growth in interest expenditure at savings banks 
and credit cooperatives. According to data 
from the monthly balance sheet statistics, sav -
ings banks and credit cooperatives respectively 
held just under one- third and just over one-  
fifth of the annual average total stock of over -
night deposits in 2022. Big banks likewise ac -
counted for just under one-  fifth of total over -
night deposits. At the same time, however, they also held around 17% of total time de -
posits, and interest rates on those rose signifi -
cantly more swiftly and more sharply in 2022 
than interest rates on overnight deposits.45 By 
contrast, the shares in the total stock of time 
deposits held by savings banks and credit co -
operatives was much smaller at just over 3% 
and just under 6%, respectively.
Overall, differences between the speed and de -
gree of interest rate increases applying to loans 
and deposits led to a significant rise in the mar -
gin in new business from the beginning of 
2022. From mid- 2022, the margin in existing 
business increased as well, with the time lag 
being the result of long interest rate fixation 
periods – especially in the case of loans for 
house purchase.46
In 2022, net commission income remained the 
second most important source of revenue for 
German credit institutions. However, its share 
of operating income fell by roughly 3 percent -
age points on the year, to around 27%.
Unlike in 2021, net commission income there -
fore did not play a part in improving operating 
income in the reporting year. Commissions re -
ceived and commissions paid rose by equal 
amounts in 2022, leaving net commission in -
come unchanged at the previous year’s level of 
€37.9 billion. Owing to strong balance sheet 
growth, the commission margin declined by 
0.04 percentage point and, at 0.36%, was only 
slightly above its long- term average. This sug -
gests that, overall, German credit institutions 
were unable to use increased business volumes 
to bolster commissions business.
The fact that the growth in net commission in -
come seen in the previous year did not persist 
in 2022 is likely to have been the result of op -
posing dynamics in the various segments mak -
ing up commissions business. Overall, German Net commission 
income stag -

in 2021, did not

credit institutions derived most benefit out of 
lending, card business and payment activities. 
By contrast, securities and safe custody busi -
ness with customers, which had still been a 
major driver behind the improvement in net 
commission income in 2021, was a notable 
area of deterioration, whilst issuance and advis -
ory business also performed less well.
A comparison across categories of banks this 
reporting year reveals a heterogeneity not seen 
the year before. Big banks and regional and 
other commercial banks recorded the biggest 
declines in net commission income, at -7.6% 
and -1.3% respectively. Despite those declines, 
these two categories of banks accounted for 
just under half of German credit institutions’ 
total net commission income in 2022.
By contrast, Landesbanken (+15.1%), savings 
banks (+4.6%) and credit cooperatives (+1.6%) 
recorded increases in net commission income 
– in some cases sizeable ones.In a comparison between the various categor -
ies of banks, the different trajectories of net 
commission income also carried through to 
commission margins. Having recorded in -
creases in the previous year, big banks and re -
gional and other commercial banks saw com -
mission margins contract in 2022, with pres -
sure coming in the form of high balance sheet 
growth and decreased net commission income 
for both categories. In the case of the big 
banks, half of the 0.07 percentage point de -
cline in the commission margin was due to the 
increase in average total assets for the year, 
while the other half can be put down to their 
lower net commission income. At regional and 
other commercial banks, the significant 
0.17 percentage point decline in the commis -
sion margin was primarily due to the above-  
average growth in total assets. These develop -
ments suggest that both categories of banks 
experienced a general downturn in commis -
sions business despite the fact that business 
volumes increased overall. Following the de -
cline in the reporting year, commission margins 
at big banks and regional and other commer -
cial banks stood at 0.38% and 0.44% respect -
ively, close to the aggregate for all German 
banks.
By contrast, savings banks and credit coopera -
tives achieved commission margins that were 
considerably above average, at 0.61% and 
0.54% respectively. This meant savings banks 
matched their commission margin from the 
previous year. The positive effect stemming 
from the rise in net commission income served 
to offset the dampening effect of the increase 
in average total assets for the year. It therefore 
appears that savings banks primarily increased 
their net commission income in 2022 through 
higher business volumes. By contrast, credit co -
operatives were evidently unable to harness 
the expansion in business volumes to strengthen 
commissions business. Here, the commission 
margin fell slightly by 0.01 percentage point, as 
the dampening effect of the increase in total 
assets outweighed the positive impact from the 
increase in net commission income.Heterogeneous

In 2022, the net result from the trading port -
folio was the second most important growth 
factor for operating income after net interest 
income. The €4.8 billion increase in net trading 
income contributed around one- third to the 
total growth in operating income. Furthermore, 
the net result from the trading portfolio almost 
doubled compared with the previous year, 
reaching €9.8 billion; this took its share of op -
erating income from just under 4% in 2021 to 
just under 7% in the reporting year.
As in previous years, the trading result re -
mained a key source of revenue in the report -
ing year, particularly for big banks, regional 
banks and other commercial banks as well as 
Landesbanken. All three categories of banks 
achieved significantly higher net trading in -
come. Compared with 2021, big banks more 
than doubled their trading result to €4.1 billion 
and generated just over 40% of the overall 
trading result in the reporting year. Regional 
banks and other commercial banks increased 
their trading result by just over 80% on the 
year to €2.7 billion and generated just under 
30% of the overall trading result. This improve -
ment is likely to be partly due to one institu -
tion’s mergers with foreign business units. Lan -
desbanken, too, almost doubled their trading 
result compared with the previous year, con -
tributing just under 20% to the overall trading 
result with their €1.7 billion.
All in all, the improvement in the trading result 
was mainly due to valuation gains on deriva -
tives, the sale of hedging instruments and the 
provision of capital market financing. Amid the 
altered interest rate environment and the 
macroeconomic uncertainty caused by geopol -
itical tensions, customers exhibited increased 
demand. Currency and commodities transac -
tions also contributed to the increase.
The other operating result47 increased in the re -
porting year by just under 58% to €1.8 billion. 
However, it had no bearing on overall operat -
ing income or the rise in the latter in 2022.The increase in the other operating result was 
primarily driven by savings banks and credit co -
operatives, as well as regional and other com -
mercial banks. In particular, they dissolved pro -
visions that had been set aside in previous years 
for restructuring purposes and for legal and 
litigation risks, for example.
The overall increase in the other operating re -
sult was dampened by the big banks. A signifi -
cant expansion of other operating expenses 
resulted in a substantial reduction in their other 
operating result. This was mainly attributable 
to spending arising from the marking- up of 
post- employment benefit obligations.Net trading

Net valuation charges
German credit institutions’ net valuation 
charges48 increased significantly in 2022 and 
thus had a strong negative impact on the ag -
gregate profit for the financial year before tax. 
Following an increase of €12.6 billion, net valu -
ation charges in the reporting year stood at 
€16.2 billion – four- and- a- half times the previ -
ous year’s level. This figure exceeded both the 
long- term average (€13.6 billion) and the level 
recorded in 2020 (€13.3 billion), when credit 
risk provisioning increased significantly due to 
the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. The 
increase in net valuation charges offset the im -
provement in operating income in 2022 by 
around 85%.
This steep increase was chiefly attributable to 
high depreciation of and value adjustments to 
loans and advances, and provisions for contin -
gent liabilities and for commitments. At €18.3 
billion in the reporting year, they stood at just over two- and- a- half times the previous year’s 
figure, putting them above the long- term aver -
age of €17.4 billion. At the same time, receipts 
from value readjustments to loans and ad -
vances as well as provisions for contingent 
liabilities and for commitments declined by just 
under 40% relative to 2021, to €2.1 billion.
Savings banks and credit cooperatives ac -
counted for the bulk of the rise in net valuation 
charges in 2022. Together, they were respon -
sible for almost 70% of the total increase. The 
net valuation charges of savings banks (€4.7 
billion) and credit cooperatives (€4.1 billion) 
were also well above their long- term averages 
(€2.3 billion and €1.7 billion respectively). In 
the reporting year, these categories of banks 
presented a fairly uniform picture: more than 
80% of savings banks and almost 90% of 
credit cooperatives recorded increases in their 
net valuation charges compared with 2021. In 
particular, large price losses stemming from the 
increased interest rate level and the resultant 
write- downs on securities in the liquidity re -
serve had a negative impact, although in some 
cases available reserves and interest rate hedges 
were used to compensate for this. In addition, 
securities in the liquidity reserve were also re -
classified from current to fixed assets. Although 
this partly avoided direct effects on income, it 
also resulted in the accumulation of hidden 
losses.49
On the other hand, heightened risk provision -
ing in lending business was less important for 
savings banks and credit cooperatives overall, 
in spite of the challenging macroeconomic en -
vironment.Sharp rise in

In contrast to savings banks and credit co -
operatives, the big banks barely contributed to 
the increase in net valuation charges in 2022 
on the whole. Unlike at the beginning of the 
coronavirus pandemic, they hardly set up any 
new risk provisions on balance during the re -
porting year, just as in the previous year. How -
ever, this was mainly due to the fact that the 
net valuation result at one institution in this 
banking category almost fully offset the net 
valuation charges of another institution in this 
group.
The situation at regional and other commercial 
banks also painted a mixed picture. While just 
over 60% of institutions in this category of 
banks increased their net valuation charges on 
the year, the remaining institutions recorded 
lower net valuation charges than in the previ -
ous year. On aggregate, the net valuation 
charges of regional and other commercial 
banks more than doubled in 2022, to €3.7 bil -
lion.
Administrative spending
General administrative spending50 climbed by a 
moderate €3.0 billion (+3.3%) in 2022. With 
regard to the profit for the financial year before 
tax in the reporting year, the increase was gen -
erally less significant than it had been a year earlier. However, together with the substantial 
increase in net valuation charges, the increase 
in administrative expenditure more than offset 
the improvement in operating income, result -
ing in a negative net effect on profit for the 
financial year before tax.
As in 2021, higher staff costs and other admin -
istrative spending contributed equally to the 
overall increase in administrative expenditure in 
the reporting year. As a result of almost equal 
increases of €1.7 billion and €1.3 billion re -
spectively, the shares of total administrative 
spending accounted for by staff costs and 
other administrative expenditure remained 
stable, at just under 51% and 49% respect -
ively.51 The increase in staff costs was primarily

Earnings effects of the interest rate reversal on securities 
held in German credit institutions’ banking books
In 2022, the signifi  cant rise in the interest 
rate level led to price losses, especially for 
fi  xed- income securities.1 However, equities 
also suffered interest- related price losses, as 
a higher interest rate level can, inter alia, 
have a negative impact on enterprises’ valu-
ations.
According to the German Commercial Code 
(Handelsgesetzbuch; HGB), the method 
used to value securities in credit institutions’ 
fi  nancial statements depends on the pur-
pose the securities are intended to serve. In 
the banking book,2 securities are valued ac-
cording to the lower of cost or market prin-
ciple. This rules out recognising a value 
higher than the book value reported in pre-
vious fi  nancial statements. If the market 
value of a security is higher than the previ-
ously established book value, hidden re-
serves build up in the amount of the posi-
tive difference between the current market 
value and the book value. If, by contrast, 
the market value of a security falls below its 
previously reported book value, two differ-
ent approaches must be considered. De-
pending on the purpose the securities are intended to serve, securities in the banking 
book are classifi  ed either as current assets 
or fi  xed assets.3 Current assets are subject 
to the strict lower of cost or market prin-
ciple, which always requires a write- down 
to the lower market value, even if it is as-
sumed that the market value will only tem-
porarily be lower than the book value. Fixed 
assets are subject to the moderate lower of 
cost or market principle. If the reduction in 
market value is not regarded as permanent, 
any depreciation requirement may be dis-
pensed with. Such unrealised losses then 
accumulate as hidden losses.4 Neither hid-
den reserves nor hidden losses are visible in 
the balance sheet or the profi  t and loss ac-
count.
As a result of the valuation approaches de-
scribed above, in 2022 a major part of the 
price losses for securities in the banking 
1 Interest rate increases lead to price losses for fi  xed- 
rate securities already in circulation as the latter can 
only match the resultant higher market return if their 
prices fall. In 2022, price losses were refl  ected in a 
12.8% decline in the German bond index (REX), for 
example.
2 The banking book comprises all on- balance sheet 
and off- balance sheet fi  nancial instruments outside the 
trading portfolio, including, for example, central bank 
balances, loans and securities (also securities in the 
liquidity reserve) assigned to the banking book. See In-
stitute of Public Auditors in Germany (2012), subsec-
tion 14.
3 If the intention is to hold the securities on a perman-
ent basis, they may be held as fi  xed assets. However, 
during the audit of the annual accounts, for example, 
evidence of the intention to hold these securities on a 
permanent basis and that such securities are suitable 
for this purpose must be provided.
4 Due to the pull- to- par effect, such hidden losses dis-
sipate again at the end of the security’s term. The pull- 
to- par effect is the gradual convergence of the market 
value of a fi  xed- interest security to its redemption 
value (par value) toward the end of the term.Key metrics for valuation of securities in

book – which were caused mainly by the 
rise in the interest rate level – were not vis-
ible in the annual results of German credit 
institutions that prepare their fi  nancial 
statements according to the HGB account-
ing standard. Overall, price losses in 2022 
amounted to around 1.5% of these institu-
tions’ average total assets for  the year. 
Around one- third (0.5% of 1.5%) of price 
losses were initially offset through the dis-
solution of hidden reserves, which de-
creased from 0.7% to 0.2% of the average 
total assets for the year. This development 
can be traced over the quarters in the chart 
on p. 105.
However, around one- half of the price 
losses in 2022 were refl  ected in an increase 
in hidden losses (0.8% of 1.5%). Only a lit-
tle under one- sixth (0.2% of 1.5%) of the 
price losses were recognised in the income 
statement as write- downs of securities clas-
sifi  ed as current assets.The need for write- downs may vary be-
tween individual institutions, partly on ac-
count of different securities holdings,5 but 
also in view of the purpose that the secur-
ities are intended to serve and the resulting 
valuation method used. The adjacent chart 
shows changes in the shares of securities 
classifi  ed as current assets or fi  xed assets in 
the banking books of German credit institu-
tions on aggregate. Whilst only around one 
in three securities had been allocated to 
fi  xed assets until 2021, this share gradually 
increased to 53% in 2022. Shifts in these 
shares are also visible at the level of individ-
ual institutions. Whilst around 70% of insti-
tutions still held their securities fully in cur-
rent assets at the end of 2021, by the end 
of 2022 this fi  gure was only 23%.
There are two general explanations for the 
shifts in these shares in 2022, with total 
holdings remaining virtually unchanged. 
First, the share of fi  xed assets in the bank-
ing book may have increased due to the 
sale or redemption (at maturity) of secur-
ities classifi  ed as current assets if the pro-
ceeds were subsequently reinvested in 
securities classifi  ed as fi  xed assets. Second, 
some securities that had not yet reached 
maturity were reclassifi  ed from current 
assets to fi  xed assets.6 This reclassifi  cation 
enabled the reversal of write- downs recog-
nised in the income statement since the last 
assessment of the book value and increased 
hidden losses to the same extent. Some of 
the hidden losses incurred in 2022 are 
therefore also attributable to reclassifi  ed 
securities.
5 The signifi  cance of securities in the banking book 
varies between the balance sheets of German credit 
institutions. While securities in the banking book at the 
beginning of 2022 accounted for around one- fi  fth of 
the aggregate bank balance sheet, at the level of indi-
vidual institutions they made up more than one- third 
of the balance sheet at every tenth institution.
6 A reallocation of securities from current assets to 
fi  xed assets is permissible provided that it is based on a 
decision of the management board and that the inten-
tion to hold securities permanently can be plausibly 
demonstrated.Allocation of securities in the banking

The increase in the balance in the other and 
extraordinary account in 2022 was again influ -
enced to a large extent by the big banks. 
Higher valuation of holdings at one institution 
resulted in a substantial rise in the balance in 
big banks’ other and extraordinary account. 
Furthermore, the expenditure in this account 
fell markedly compared with 2021. The €5.0 
billion increase resulting from both develop -
ments led to the big banks reporting net rev -
enue of €3.9 billion in the other and extraor -
dinary account in 2022, having recorded net 
charges the previous year. In addition, the 
sharp rise seen by the big banks more than off -
set, in particular, the deterioration in the bal -
ances in the other and extraordinary account of 
savings banks and credit cooperatives as well 
as of mortgage banks. In the case of savings 
banks and credit cooperatives, the balances in 
the other and extraordinary account fell by 
€1.6 billion and €0.7 billion respectively com -
pared with the previous year. In both cases, the 
main reason for this was significantly increased depreciation of and value adjustments to par -
ticipating interests, shares in affiliated enter -
prises and securities treated as fixed assets, 
which are likely to have also been related to 
the interest rate reversal. By contrast, the €1.3 
billion decline in mortgage banks’ balance was 
primarily due to decreased income resulting 
from the assumption of losses.

age.56 This indicates a slight deterioration in 
profitability for several reasons. First, the aggre -
gate profit for the financial year before tax in -
creased only marginally. Second, the improve -
ment in net profit for the financial year was ul -
timately driven by the increase in the balance in 
the other and extraordinary account, which 
was the result of the positive balance of the big 
banks. Third, average balance sheet equity for 
the year rose steeply. This had a negative im -
pact on the return on equity, which was more 
than three- and- a- half times as great as the 
positive effect of the slight increase in profit for 
the financial year.
A general deterioration in profitability is also 
suggested by the fact that aside from the big 
banks, the Landesbanken and the building and 
loan associations, all other categories of 
banks57 showed a lower return on equity in 
2022 than in the previous year. Relatively large 
declines were observed, first and foremost, 
among mortgage banks (-10.92  percentage points)58 and credit cooperatives (-3.78  per -
centage points). However, the return on equity 
of savings banks also fell by 1.50 percentage 
points.
In each case, the decline was primarily attribut -
able to the profit for the financial year before 
tax. Among mortgage banks, the profit for the 
financial year before tax declined relatively sig -
nificantly at a low level owing to the steep de -
cline in the balance in the other and extraordin -
ary account. In the case of savings banks and 
credit cooperatives, by contrast, the sharp rise 
in net valuation charges was chiefly responsible 
for the decreased profit for the financial year 
before tax. On balance, the return on equity of 
savings banks and credit cooperatives in 2022 
amounted to 4.77% and 4.59% respectively, 
which was just below the aggregate level 
across all German banks. In the previous year, 
these two categories of banks still recorded a 
significantly above- average return on equity.
By contrast, the big banks recorded the largest 
increase in return on equity among all the cat -
egories of banks considered. Having still been 
negative, at -2.26%, due to a net loss for the 
financial year in 2021, the return on equity of 
the big banks rose very significantly in the re -
porting year by 11.38  percentage points to 
9.12%. In 2022, the big banks thus recorded by 
far the highest return on equity out of all the 
categories of banks under review. The steep in -
crease was almost exclusively driven by the 
massive improvement in the profit for the 
financial year before tax, which was mainly due 
to the sharp rise in the balance in the other and 
extraordinary account.

Return on assets
In general, the return on assets (the ratio of 
profit for the financial year before tax to aver -
age total assets for the year) moved in parallel 
with the return on equity. The exceptionally 
high growth in the average aggregate total 
assets for the year was the main reason for a 
year- on- year decline of 0.03 percentage point 
in the return on assets. By contrast, the small 
increase in the profit for the financial year be -
fore tax had no significant effect. Contrary to 
the return on equity, the return on assets in 
2022, at 0.26%, remained above the long- term 
average of 0.22% in spite of the decline.
The picture is also similar to that of the return 
on equity with regard to the categories of 
banks. Here, too, only the big banks (+0.29 per -
centage point), the building and loan associ -
ations (+0.06 percentage point) and the Lan -
desbanken (+0.02 percentage point) recorded 
increases. The big banks’ return on assets im -proved to 0.23% after having been still in 
slightly negative territory in 2021; this improve -
ment was, in particular, due to the steep rise in 
profit for the financial year.
On the other hand, mortgage banks and credit 
cooperatives as well as regional and other 
commercial banks and savings banks registered 
particularly sharp declines in their return on 
assets. In the case of mortgage banks, the 
strong decrease in profit for the financial year 
was almost solely responsible for the steep 
drop of 0.49  percentage point in return on 
assets. By contrast, the 0.16 percentage point 
decline in return on assets at regional and other 
commercial banks was primarily due to the 
sharp increase in total assets.
The savings banks’ and credit cooperatives’ re -
turn on assets also fell significantly, by 0.13 per -
centage point and 0.31 percentage point re -
spectively. In both cases, the main driver of this 
development was the steep decline in profit for Overall return

the financial year before tax. At 0.41% and 
0.39% respectively, the return on assets of sav -
ings banks and credit cooperatives was never -
theless significantly above the level of the ag -
gregate of all German credit institutions.Cost efficiency
Measured by the cost/ income ratio in its broad 
definition (administrative spending relative to 
operating income), German credit institutions’ 
cost efficiency improved substantially in 2022. 
The cost/ income ratio fell to 67.3% overall in 
the reporting year (previous year: 72.9%) and 
was thus slightly below the long- term average 
of 68.2% for the first time since 2012. The in -
crease in administrative expenditure in 2022 
was, again, not insignificant. However, operat -
ing income rose almost five times as sharply, 
meaning that the increased administrative ex -
penditure made less of an impact than in the 
previous year.
The improvement was particularly marked for 
the big banks, which in 2021 showed the larg -
est cost/ income ratio deterioration of all the 
categories of banks considered. The decline of 
9.4 percentage points in the reporting year was 
due to both higher operating income and 
lower administrative expenses. Nevertheless, at 
89.8%, the cost/ income ratio of the big banks 
was still significantly higher than for the other 
categories of banks considered.59 Furthermore, 
within the category of big banks, develop -
ments at the level of the individual institutions 
varied greatly.
By contrast, the picture was much more uni -
form among the savings banks, almost all of 
which reported declines in their cost/ income 
ratios. Overall too, savings banks therefore re -
corded a significant decline in their cost/ income 
ratio, of 8.7 percentage points. Moreover, at 
62.0%, this was below the level of the aggre -
gate across all German banks and below the 
long- term average for savings banks. This im -
provement was chiefly due to the rise in their 
operating income.Significant over -

Compared with savings banks, the decline in 
the cost/ income ratio of credit cooperatives 
was rather moderate, at 3.4 percentage points. 
Operating income in this area rose relatively 
weakly in relation to administrative expend -
iture. Moreover, developments at the level of 
the individual institutions were somewhat less 
uniform than at the savings banks, with just 
over two- thirds of credit cooperatives record -
ing a decline in their cost/ income ratio. Overall, 
at 62.5%, the cost/ income ratio of credit co -
operatives was only slightly higher than that of 
savings banks.
Outlook
In the current year, high inflation rates, the 
tightening of monetary policy and persistently 
elevated uncertainty about macroeconomic de -
velopments will continue to shape German 
credit institutions’ business environment. Ger -
many’s economic output stagnated in the 
second quarter of 2023 after having contracted 
in the winter half- year (October- March). Higher 
financing costs, in particular, have recently 
dampened domestic investment, which has 
weighed on industry and the construction sec -
tor above all.60
Against the backdrop of persistently high infla -
tion rates, the Eurosystem has continued to 
tighten monetary policy. In May 2023, the Gov -
erning Council of the ECB decided to reduce 
the asset purchase programme (APP) portfolio 
at a moderate pace. Furthermore, since July 
2023, no principal payments from maturing 
securities under the APP have been reinvested. 
In addition, the Eurosystem continued to raise 
key interest rates, but reduced the size of each 
increase from 50 basis points to 25 basis points 
in May 2023.61The extent to which the rising interest rate level 
will bolster the profitability of German banks in 
the medium term following a short- term strain 
remains to be seen. In a persistently difficult 
economic environment, risks that have a nega -
tive impact on profitability are on the rise. The 
need for further impairments on fixed- income 
securities is expected to decline due to smaller 
interest rate steps being made by the Euro -
system and reduced interest rate expectations 
on the part of the markets. However, it is un -
certain whether the recently observed improve -
ment in net interest income will continue. In 
particular, the increase in the interest margin in 
outstanding lending and deposit business62 of 
German credit institutions in 2022 is likely to 
prove unsustainable: rising deposit rates here 
are likely to be reflected on the expenditure 
side, should the competition for deposits and 
therefore the pass- through of interest rates 
into deposit business increase. In addition, 
both demand- side and supply- side factors are 
putting increasing pressure on new lending, 
which could also bring down the interest mar -
gin in outstanding lending through a reduced 
margin in new business. Weak overall eco -
nomic growth could additionally lead to an in -
crease in credit defaults.
The profitability of German institutions will 
probably be more greatly affected by structural 
changes such as digitalisation and climate con -
siderations in future. Recently, cyber and infor -
mation risks have also posed an increasing 
challenge to German credit institutions; these 
are likely to lead to growing investment needs 
and therefore higher administrative expend -
iture.Business envir -

associations), money market funds, and the European Central Bank and national central
banks (the Eurosystem).  1 Source: ECB.  2 In Germany, only savings deposits.
3 Excluding holdings of MFIs; for the German contribution, excluding German MFIs'
portfolios of securities issued by MFIs in the euro area.  4 In Germany, bank debt
securities with maturities of up to one year are classed as money market paper.5 Excluding liabilities arising from securities issued.  6 After deduction of inter-MFI
participations.  7 The German contributions to the Eurosystem's monetary aggregates
should on no account be interpreted as national monetary aggregates and are
therefore not comparable with the erstwhile German money stocks M1, M2 or M3.

the German contribution, the difference between the volume of euro banknotes

Discrepancies may arise from rounding.  * The banking system's liquidity position is
defined as the current account holdings in euro of euro area credit institutions with the
Eurosystem. Amounts are derived from the consolidated financial statement of the
Eurosystem and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  1 Figures are daily averages
for the reserve maintenance period ending in the month indicated. Following the
changeover in the frequency of Governing Council monetary policy meetings to a
six-week cycle, a reserve maintenance period no longer ends in every month. No figuresare available in such cases.  2 Source: ECB.  3 Includes liquidity provided under the
Eurosystem's asset purchase programmes.  4 From August 2009 includes liquidity
absorbed as a result of the Eurosystem's foreign exchange swap operations.  5 From
2002 euro banknotes and other banknotes which have been issued by the national cen-
tral banks of the Eurosystem and which are still in circulation. In accordance with the
accounting procedure chosen by the Eurosystem for the issue of euro banknotes, a
share of 8% of the total value of the euro banknotes in circulation is

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).

for employees subject to social contributions, by a maximum of 0.5% for persons
solely in jobs exempt from social contributions, and by a maximum of 61,3% for
cyclically induced short-time work.  9 Initial preliminary estimate by the Federal Statis-

* The effective exchange rate corresponds to the weighted external value of the curren-
cy concerned. The method of calculating the indicators of the German economy's price
competitiveness is consistent with the procedure to compute the effective exchange
rates of the euro. A decline in the figures implies an increase in competitiveness. The
weights are based on trade in manufactured goods and services. For more detailed in-
formation on methodology and weighting scale, see the website of the Deutsche
Bundesbank (https://www.bundesbank.de/content/796162).  1 The calculations are
based on the weighted averages of the changes in the bilateral exchange rates of the
euro vis-à-vis the currencies of the following 18 countries: Australia, Bulgaria, Canada,
China, Czechia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan, Norway, Poland, Romania,
Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United
States. Where current price and wage indices were not available, estimates were used.
2 Includes countries belonging to the extended EER group of trading partners (fixed
composition) and additionally the following 23 countries: Algeria, Argentina, Brazil,
Chile, Colombia, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, New Zea-
land, Peru, Philippines, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Taiwan,Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and United Arab Emirates. The ECB has suspended the
publication and calculation of the euro foreign exchange reference rate against Russian
rouble with effect from March 2, 2022 until further notice. For the calculation of
effective exchange rates, an indicative rate is used for the Russian Federation from that
date. It is calculated from the daily RUB/USD rates determined by the Bank of Russia in
conjunction with the respective ECB's euro foreign exchange reference rate to the US
dollar.  3 Annual and quarterly averages.  4 Euro area countries (from 2001 including
Greece, from 2007 including Slovenia, from 2008 including Cyprus and Malta, from
2009 including Slovakia, from 2011 including Estonia, from 2014 including Latvia, from
2015 including Lithuania, from 2023 including Croatia) as well as Canada, Denmark,
Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.
