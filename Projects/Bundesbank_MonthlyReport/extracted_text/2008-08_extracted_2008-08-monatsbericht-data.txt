6OverviewExpected countermovement
in output alongside continued highinflation pressure
The ongoing deterioration in the global price
climate, which was triggered by the renewedupsurge in oil prices and strong food priceinflation and is now increasingly leading toindirect knock-on effects, placed perceptiblestrains on the global economy in the secondquarter of 2008. In addition, conditions in thereal estate markets in the United States andseveral European countries continued to havea dampening effect. Economic momentumin south and east Asia likewise weakenedowing to losses in purchasing power, al-though it still remained relatively strong.Nonetheless, as the major economic areashave different underlying conditions and areaffected to varying degrees, there is no fearof a slump in global economic growth.
The international financial markets also had a
dampening effect on global economic activityin the second quarter. Despite noticeable pro-gress in the consolidation process, the mar-kets are still in a fragile condition. The stockmarkets, which at the beginning of thesecond quarter were still underpinned by therelatively positive earnings results posted bycompanies, subsequently recorded net lossesfollowing renewed concern about the ramifi-cations of the US mortgage crisis and increas-ing fears of an economic slowdown duringthe remainder of 2008. European capital mar-ket rates increased between the beginningof April and the beginning of July by around

7rather robust economic indicators. However,
they subsequently fell back to just under4
1/C252% in the wake of a series of unfavourable
economic data for the euro area and Ger-many. After holding very firm for a time, theeuro concurrently lost considerable groundagainst other major world currencies frommid-July onwards. On a trade-weighted aver-age, the euro depreciated by around 2
1/C252%
between the beginning of April and mid-August.
As a result of the sharp increase in the prices
of crude oil and agricultural products on theworld markets, consumer prices in the euroarea at the end of the second quarter – as inJuly – were up 4.0% on the year. The inflationrate was thus well above the price stabilitybenchmark defined by the Eurosystem. Theprimary duty of monetary policy is to ensurethat the general price level in the economy asa whole remains stable in the medium term.The medium-term risks to price stability in theeuro area increased further in connectionwith the ongoing external price surges. This isborne out by the macroeconomic projectionsmade by Eurosystem experts in June. The factthat a somewhat slower pace of economicgrowth is expected in the near future doesnot of itself constitute an adequate stabilitypolicy counterweight which will automaticallyoffset the inflationary pressure. For one thing,macroeconomic activity is unlikely to weakenso much that it could trigger an equal andopposite counterswing in the price level. Foranother, the more moderate pace of growthis not due exclusively to reduced demand andtherefore cannot simply be equated with acorresponding closing of the output gap,which is a major factor in stoking domestic in-
flation pressure. Besides the primary cyclicalfactors, dampening effects are currently alsocoming from the supply side; these likewiseultimately stem from the sustained rise in theprices of energy and raw materials as theydepress the profitability of production capaci-ties and processes and lower the demand forenergy-intensive products. Hence, despite thegenerally muted assessment of the euroarea’s growth outlook, market players’ infla-tion expectations – as ascertained from sur-veys or financial market data – remainedabove a level compatible with long-term pricestability throughout the period under review.
This impression is confirmed by longer-term
inflation forecasts based on monetary aggre-gates. In the second quarter of 2008, moneyholdings in the euro area grew again stronglyfrom what was already a high level. The broadmonetary aggregate M3 expanded at a sea-sonally adjusted annualised rate of just under8%, compared with 7% in the first quarter.As in the preceding quarters, it was primarilythose components remunerated at close-to-market rates which increased. The robustmonetary growth was again caused by amarked rise in loans to the private sector.
Against this backdrop, the Governing Council
of the ECB decided in early July to tighten thereins of monetary policy somewhat andtherefore raised each of the Eurosystem’s cen-tral bank rates by
1/C254percentage point. The
minimum bid rate for the Eurosystem’s mainrefinancing operations conducted as variable-rate tenders has since stood at 4.25%. Theshort-term money market rates increasedMonetary

8correspondingly in July. Apart from transient
and short-lived fluctuations towards the endof the month, the EONIA overnight ratestood at around 4.3% compared with around4% in the preceding months. The longer-term money market rates rose as early asJune in anticipation of the ECB GoverningCouncil’s interest rate adjustment. On aver-age, the three-month rates in June, at justunder 5%, were up around 0.1 percentagepoint on the month.
After growing very dynamically in the early
part of the year, the German economyslowed perceptibly in the second quarter of2008. According to the Federal StatisticalOffice’s flash estimate, seasonally and calen-dar-adjusted real GDP declined by 0.5% onthe first quarter between April and June.Nevertheless, economic output was still up1.7% on the year after calendar adjustment,compared with 2.6% in the previous quarter.The decline in overall economic output in thereporting quarter is to be seen primarily in thecontext of the very high output volume re-corded in the first quarter when, owing inpart to special factors in the production sec-tor, the German economy grew by 1.3% onthe fourth quarter of 2007. As expected, eco-nomic developments in the second quarterwere also significantly dampened by corres-ponding counterswings.
However, this does not indicate a fundamen-
tal deterioration in the overall economic situ-ation, nor does it point to a loss of the cyclicalresilience that has been regained over thepast few years. Nonetheless, further difficul-ties arose in the first half of 2008 in additionto the ongoing uncertainties and the global
challenges which have yet to be surmounted.Consequently, the cumulative overall “riskmix” now implies a noticeable impact on Ger-many’s economic development, meaning thata slower pace of activity is to be expected forthe remainder of the year.
This emanates particularly from the current
price pressures both in Germany and abroad.The massive energy price rises have led toconsiderable real income losses in the matureeconomies over the past few years and thepropensity to consume has been hampered.This is weakening domestic demand andactivity in major German export markets.
Despite the weaker economic activity, em-
ployment in Germany increased further in thesecond quarter of 2008, albeit more modest-ly. There was a corresponding reduction inunemployment. At a seasonally adjusted69,000 persons, the decline in unemploy-ment was, however, significantly smaller thanin the first quarter (209,000 persons). The un-employment rate, as defined nationally, fellfrom 8.0% in the first quarter of 2008 to7.9% in the second quarter. There was afurther slight decline in registered unemploy-ment in July. As in June, the correspondingrate stood at 7.8%. The considerable im-provement in the labour market situation ofthe past few years was reflected in higherwage agreements in many sectors. Measuredin terms of growth in negotiated basic payrates, wage agreements were up 3.4% onthe year, compared with 3.1% in the firstquarter. The accelerated trend in negotiatedwages is also likely to have been reflected in a

9more rapid increase in national unit labour
costs in the second quarter.
Price developments in the second quarter of
2008 were marked all along the productionand sales chain by the sharp rises in crude oilprices in the world markets. External pricepressures on the German economy increasedagain discernibly as a result. German con-sumer prices rose on average by a seasonallyadjusted 0.8% on the quarter. Just over halfof this was attributable to the energy com-ponent, which increased by 4.4%. The pricesfor heating oil and fuel climbed by almost20% and just over 7%, respectively, on thefirst quarter. By contrast, the upward pressureon food prices eased. The prices of industrialproducts (excluding energy) and services rosesomewhat. In July, the inflation rate in Ger-many, measured in terms of the increase inthe consumer price index, was up 3.3% onthe year.
Following a marginal surplus in 2007, general
government finances are likely to record aslight deficit again this year. This is primarilydue to structural factors. In particular, thereform of business taxation and a furtherlowering of the contribution rate of the Fed-eral Employment Agency from 4.2% to 3.3%will result in significant revenue shortfalls.The sizeable tax and social security rate cutshave not been matched by the evolution ofexpenditure which, while still fairly moderate,is rising faster than in previous years. In add-ition, the exceptionally robust growth trendin revenue from profit-related taxes, whichhas been evident for several years now, couldreverse during the remainder of the year,especially given the turbulence on the finan-
cial markets.
Overall, the public finance situation in Ger-
many has improved noticeably in the pastfew years. The European requirements for themedium-term budgetary objective arisingfrom the Stability and Growth Pact and thereference value for government indebtednessstipulated in the EC Treaty could well be metin the not-too-distant future. However, thisprospect is subject to considerable uncer-tainty. This concerns, firstly, the possibility offurther budget-burdening measures. Thus theupcoming recalculation of the official socio-cultural minimum subsistence level can be ex-pected to lead to an increase in the relevanttax allowances (and, in all likelihood, childbenefit, too). Secondly, further cuts in tax andsocial security rates and extra spending arecurrently under discussion. Thirdly, a substan-tial drop in revenue levels is likely to resultfrom 2010 onwards owing to a ruling by theFederal Constitutional Court referring to theoffsetting of health and long-term care insur-ance contributions against tax. If the bal-anced general government budgetary pos-ition that has been painstakingly achieved isnot to be frittered away, any additionalbudget-burdening measures will require solidcounterfinancing. Fourthly, the currentmacroeconomic outlook is fraught with con-siderable uncertainty. Both past experienceand the latest developments in some othercountries have shown just how quickly thepublic finance situation can deteriorate givenan unfavourable economic setting.

11Global and
European settingWorld economic activity
The continuing deterioration in the global
price climate triggered by a renewed surge inthe price of oil and a strong rise in food priceinflation in the spring months placed a con-siderable burden on the world economy. Thereal estate markets in the United States andseveral European countries also exerted adampening effect. Global growth is thereforelikely to have slowed further, with economicmomentum in a number of emerging marketeconomies also being more subdued of late.The accelerated rate of price increase notonly reduced consumers’ purchasing power,it also clouded expectations. Several centralbanks responded by raising interest rates.Nevertheless, in view of strong inflationarypressures, real interest rates can still be re-garded as low across the entire maturity spec-trum; in some countries, they are even likelyto have slipped into negative territory.
The situation on the international food mar-
kets has eased considerably since mid-yearand crude oil prices have dropped sharplysince mid-July. However, consumer price pres-sure is likely to remain high for the foresee-able future as some price pressures on up-stream sectors of the economy have not yetbeen passed on to consumers. Moreover,higher prices for commodities and primarymaterials are likely to aggravate indirecteffects in several countries. In some cases,second-round effects are also becoming moreof an issue, particularly in emerging marketeconomies, developing countries and theCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS),where inflation expectations are generallyGlobal

12less well anchored. In addition, the inter-
national financial markets exerted a dampen-ing impact on global economic activity in thesecond quarter. Despite making noticeableadjustment progress, these markets are still ina fragile condition, as evidenced by therenewed flare-up of the crisis on the US mort-gage market in July.
Given the confluence of serious disruptive
factors impacting the global economy atpresent, economic momentum is likely toslow down further in the second half of theyear. Nonetheless, the risk of drifting into aglobal recession appears very limited atpresent, not least as the key economic areasare at different stages of the economic cycleand are being affected by current develop-ments to varying degrees. The InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF), in its forecast of mid-July – which will be reviewed in greater depthin the following – predicts that expansionaryforces will gradually come to dominate againin 2009.
Overall, real gross domestic product (GDP) in
the industrial countries grew only marginallyin seasonally adjusted terms in the secondquarter compared with +
1/C252% in the first
quarter of the year. The year-on-year increasewas 1
1/C252%. Special factors, among others, put
a brake on growth. For example, overall eco-nomic output in the euro area declined by
1/C254%, partly as a result of technical counter-re-
actions to the mild weather in the wintermonths. Real GDP in Japan witnessed aneven more marked decline after expandingstrongly in the first quarter, not least becausethe backlog of residential building permitsSeasonally adjusted,

13was cleared in that period. By contrast, US
economic growth was noticeably faster thanin the final quarter of 2007 and the first quar-ter of 2008, when gains had been small. Thiscan be explained largely by very buoyantexports and the expansionary stimuli from thegovernment’s economic programme, whichsupported private consumption.
Growth in the south and east Asian emerging
market economies also slowed down in thesecond quarter, although it still remainedcomparatively high. This development wasattributable to both the weakening importpull from the industrial countries and the in-creasing erosion of household purchasingpower as a result of higher energy and foodprices. The hefty increase in commodity priceson the markets was a contributory factorhere as was the fact that several governmentsraised the administered prices for refinedpetroleum products as the fiscal cost of sub-sidising these products had become too greatfor the government budget or state-ownedmonopoly enterprises. However, cereal prices,especially the price of rice, dropped signifi-cantly during the spring months, thus redu-cing consumer price pressure of late. Forexample, Chinese inflation fell from 8.5% to6.3% between April and July. However, itshould be borne in mind that, despite recentincreases in the price of petrol and diesel, thecountry still has in place a number of pricecontrols, which could result in suppressedinflation. In a year-on-year comparison, thepace of economic growth in China slippedslightly from 10
1/C252% in the first quarter to
10% in the second quarter.The Latin American economies were on a
somewhat flatter, but still striking growthtrajectory in the second quarter. The cyclicalretarding effects stemming from the USA,which were especially noticeable in CentralAmerica, were still offset by expansionarystimuli from the ongoing commodities boom.However, the sharp rise in inflation marredthe picture here too, with higher food pricesgenerally having a stronger impact than en-ergy price hikes as food is given a relativelylarge weighting in the basket of goods.In Brazil, the rate of inflation has risen by1.7 percentage points to 6.2% since March2008, while in Mexico it has increased by1.7 percentage points to 5.4% from its lastlow at the beginning of the year. In recentmonths, the central banks of several LatinAmerican countries have hiked interest rates,in some cases significantly, in order to containinflationary pressures.
Sharp price increases currently also represent
a major challenge for economic policy in theCIS. The situation is particularly strained inUkraine, where inflation stood at 26.8% atthe end of the period under review. Russiarecorded consumer price inflation of 14.7%in July, up from 8.8% a year earlier. Hereagain, the greatest pressure is emanatingfrom food. The price outlook is likely toremain unfavourable for some time to comeif the government implements its – basicallylaudable – plans to bring its still relatively lowadministered energy prices more into linewith west European levels over the next fewyears. Besides high inflation, a number ofother indicators suggest that the Russianeconomy is at imminent risk of overheating.

14As industrial production expanded apace in
the second quarter, GDP growth is likely tohave been fairly strong too, and capacityoverutilisation is likely to have further intensi-fied.
In its mid-July update of its April World Eco-
nomic Outlook report, the IMF raised itsglobal growth projection for 2008 by 0.4 per-centage point to 4.1%. This was the result ofthe significant upward correction of the fairly
pessimistic spring forecast for the USA by0.8 percentage point to 1.3%.
1In addition,
the forecast for the euro area was revisedupwards by 0.3 percentage point to 1.7% inresponse to strong first-quarter growth,which the IMF had underestimated. By com-parison, the Fund raised its forecasts forJapan, the UK and the emerging marketeconomies and developing countries onlymarginally.
However, these corrections do not alter the
general tenor of the IMF’s spring forecast,namely that the global economy will cool offin 2008, particularly in the second half of theyear. Real GDP is forecast to be 3.0% up onthe year at the end of 2008, compared with a4.8% rise in 2007. However, growth couldreach 4.3% again next year. The annual aver-age rates of change were generally revisedupwards slightly for 2009, with the IMF nowexpecting the global economy to expand by3.9% (up from +3.8%). Of the larger indus-trial countries, only Spain saw its growth fore-cast lowered, by 0.5 percentage point to1.2%. Overall, the growth forecast risks areregarded as balanced. It is noteworthy thatthe IMF now predicts higher global economicgrowth for 2008 and has virtually confirmedits 2009 projection even though oil priceshave risen considerably since the spring. Forinstance, the price assumption for a basket ofvarious types of oil was raised by US$21 toYear-on-year change

The price of Brent crude oil reached a new
high of US$1461/C252per barrel in the first half
of July. It subsequently tended to fall againdistinctly, however, and was trading atUS$113
1/C252in mid-August. Nevertheless, the
prices denominated in US dollars were still13
1/C252% higher at the end of the period under
review than at the beginning of April and60% up on the year. In euro terms, theseincreases were 19% and 46% respectively.Geopolitical factors, such as the unrest inNigeria – which led to a considerable reduc-tion in output there – and the escalation ofthe conflict with Iran regarding nuclearresources, contributed to the renewed surgein oil prices in the spring months. Moreover,there is growing scepticism as to whether oilsupply will be able to keep up with theexpected further strong growth in demandgoing forward. Recent markdowns can beattributed largely to the emerging slowdownof the world economy.
The prices of other commodities picked up
again perceptibly overall in the second quar-ter; however, they too have tended to fallagain since mid-year. At the beginning of Au-gust, industrial raw materials were hardlymore expensive in US dollar terms than theyhad been in February; in euro terms, theywere even slightly cheaper. Prices for food,beverages and tobacco meanwhile soared,especially in June, as flooding in the Midwestof the USA was originally estimated to havecaused very large crop losses. Prices have,however, declined considerably since the be-ginning of July. As this report went to press,
they were nevertheless still 39% (in US dol-lars) and 24% (in euro) up on the year.
The significant rise in the prices of energy and
agricultural commodities, which has been inevidence for some time now, sent consumerprices soaring in the industrial countries inthe second quarter. The year-on-year raterose by 1.1 percentage points to 4.6% fromMarch to July. The core inflation rate (exclud-ing energy and food) rose slightly to 2.3%.The IMF has responded to the high inflation-ary pressure by upping its price forecast sig-nificantly by an average of 0.8 percentagepoint to 3.4% this year and by 0.3 percent-age point to 2.3% next year for the industrialcountries.

2008 and 2009 respectively, which in eachcase is 1
3/C254percentage points higher than ex-
pected in April.
According to initial estimates, economic
growth in the USA picked up again noticeablyin the second quarter; real GDP expanded bya seasonally adjusted
1/C252% compared with the
preceding period, having virtually stagnatedin the fourth quarter of 2007 and the firstquarter of 2008. Year-on-year growth was1
3/C254%. The fact that growth was higher than
in the previous two quarters was due largelyto the strong expansion in real exports by aseasonally adjusted 2
1/C254%. As this was accom-
panied by a significant drop in imports, for-eign trade contributed just over
1/C252percentage
point to overall economic output growth. Inaddition, private consumption, which was
1/C252% higher than in the winter months, pro-
vided positive stimuli. The substantial tax re-bates as part of the government’s economicprogramme are likely to have been key here.Ultimately, however, consumer outlays madeup only a small percentage of the roughlyUS$80 billion in funds that had been distrib-uted by the end of June. The lion’s sharewent into savings, at least in the short term,sending the seasonally adjusted householdsaving ratio up by 2
1/C254percentage points
quarter on quarter to 21/C252% in the second
quarter. It can be assumed, however, that alarger part of these rebates will be spent onconsumer goods in the second half of theyear. By contrast, overall gross investmentplaced a considerable damper on GDPgrowth. This was particularly pronounced inthe case of inventory investment, which de-clined by
1/C252% of GDP . In addition, real resi-
dential building investment was again cur-tailed, although the decline of 4% was nolonger as marked as before. By contrast, com-mercial spending on new buildings, plant andequipment, and software rose by
1/C252%.
Of the various factors that hit US private con-
sumption in the second quarter, the strongrate of price inflation should be highlighted.This was again due to the sudden increase inenergy and food prices. In the second quar-ter, prices were up by a seasonally adjusted1.2% on the preceding period and 4.4% onthe year. In July, the rate of price increaseaccelerated further to 5.6%. The core rate,calculated by excluding these two compon-ents, stood at 2.5% when this report went topress. The core deflator, the Fed’s preferredindicator, stood at 2.2% in the second quar-ter and was thus as high as in the precedingperiod. In June, the Fed significantly raised itsApril forecast for an increase in the overall de-flator for personal consumption expenditurethis year, but it left its estimate for the coredeflator in the fourth quarter of 2008 un-changed at 2.2% to 2.4%.
In the second quarter, the Japanese economy
shrank by a seasonally adjusted
1/C252% on the
preceding period, in which it had expandedby
3/C254%. Year-on-year growth was 1%. All of
the major demand components were on adownward trend except for government con-sumption, which virtually stagnated at itsfirst-quarter level in seasonally adjustedterms. Private consumption dropped by
1/C252%,
largely as a result of the decline in real labourincome, also by

17investment slipped by1/C254% and 51/C254% respect-
ively. It is noteworthy that price-adjusted ex-penditure on new residential construction fellsharply again (-3
1/C252%) after considerable ex-
pansion in the first quarter as the backlog ofbuilding permits that had built up in thesecond half of 2007 was cleared. In addition,real exports declined by 2
1/C254% in seasonally
adjusted terms as cyclical momentum in keycustomer countries waned. However, importswere slightly harder hit (-2
3/C254%) owing to
weak domestic and foreign demand. As im-ports are smaller in volume than exports,however, their positive contribution togrowth just offset the negative export effect.
In the second quarter, rising energy and food
prices again drove up seasonally adjustedconsumer prices sharply (+0.5% quarter onquarter and +1.4% year on year). In June, in-flation even reached its highest level since1998 (+2.0%). The index excluding energyand food remained unchanged year on yearin the second quarter, as it had in the firstquarter, too. The GDP deflator fell by 1
1/C252%,
however, which is another indication that thevast majority of price impulses were external.
The UK was still beset by the sluggish growth
that had become very apparent after the turnof 2007-08. According to initial calculations,in the second quarter, real GDP again in-creased by just
1/C254% on the quarter in season-
ally adjusted terms, which means that it was1
1/C252% up on the year. The weak economic
development was evident in many sectors. Inthe production sector (including construc-tion), seasonally adjusted output was cutback by
1/C252%, while real value added in theservices sector increased by only just under
1/C252% after averaging almost 1% per quarter
in 2006 and 2007. The “business-relatedservices and finances” sector, which wasparticularly hard hit by the financial marketturmoil, made virtually no contribution togrowth. House prices slid further and were11% down on the year in July. By contrast,consumer price inflation continued to accel-erate, rising from 2.5% in March to 4.4% inJuly (as measured by the Harmonised Index ofConsumer Prices (HICP)). Core inflation (ex-cluding energy and unprocessed food) roseby almost 1 percentage point to 2.6% overthe same period.
The new EU member states experienced wan-
ing economic momentum in the second quar-ter. This was particularly pronounced in theindustrial sector, where output in the three-month period from April to June was
3/C254%
lower than in the first quarter. However, itshould also be borne in mind that the Marchresult was relatively low while the April figurewas correspondingly high as Easter was earlythis year. Nonetheless, annual growth stillcame in at 6
1/C252%. The weakening of expan-
sionary forces was particularly pronounced inEstonia and Latvia. The overall slower pace ofeconomic activity in the new EU memberstates was driven, for one, by weaker growthin demand on their sales markets in westernEurope. For another, households’ purchasingpower has been badly eroded by, for themost part, exceptionally high inflation overthe past few months. The average rate ofprice increase was 7.1% in July, a level notwitnessed since the second quarter of 2002.However, this figure masks very large differ- United

Macroeconomic trends in the euro area
In seasonally adjusted terms, overall econom-
ic output in the euro area was
1/C254% lower in
the second quarter than in the first quarter, inwhich it had expanded quite strongly (+
3/C254%).
Nevertheless, output was still 11/C252%u po n
the year. The expected technical counter-reactions to the strong construction activity– buoyed by the mild winter weather – in thenorthern part of the euro area were a key fac-tor in the fall vis-/C224-vis the first quarter of theyear, as was the sharp increase in industrialproduction in Germany at the beginning of2008. In addition, economic momentum hasdiminished in recent months. This is particu-larly true of exports and private consumption,which received a significant damper as a re-sult of the latest surge in inflation. Germany’ssignificant country weight meant that thesizeable decline in its real GDP comparedwith the first quarter lowered the euro-arearesult. The French and Italian economies alsoshrank, albeit not as much as the Germaneconomy. Spain’s overall economic output in-creased only marginally up to the end of theperiod under review.
The decline in overall economic output in the
euro area was largely attributable to theretarding effects in the production sector. Thefall in output was particularly pronounced inthe construction sector, where it dropped bya seasonally adjusted 2% in the April-Mayperiod compared with the first quarter of the
year. This can be explained by the afore-mentioned technical counter-reactions aswell as the fact that housing constructionactivity continued to weaken in several euro-area countries. Industrial production alsoeased in the second quarter, falling by
1/C252%
on the winter months in seasonally adjustedterms. Moreover, the fact that Easter wasearly this year meant that the March produc-tion figures were more affected and the Aprilfigures were less affected by holidays thanusual. The second quarter saw 1% year-on-year growth. The decline in industrial outputvis-/C224-vis the preceding period went hand inhand with a noticeable reduction in capacityutilisation by 1 percentage point; neverthe-less, it was still well above its multi-year aver-age. The volume of incoming orders in Apriland May was down by
1/C252% on the first quar-
ter in seasonally adjusted terms. In addition,the industrial confidence indicator signalled asignificantly slower pace of growth for euro-area industrial activity; it has dropped by6 points since April and, in July, was below itslong-term average for the first time since thefourth quarter of 2005.
Private consumption in the second quarter
was probably noticeably curtailed by theincrease in inflation. This is suggested by thedecline in real retail sales by a seasonallyadjusted 1% on the quarter and the fact thatnew passenger car registrations remained ona steep downward trend – more precise dataon private consumption and other majordemand components are not yet available. Inaddition, consumer confidence has onceagain fallen markedly below its long-termGDP decline

19average. While construction investment has
slumped – as explained earlier in connectionwith construction output – spending on newplant and equipment is likely to have held upbetter. Although nominal exports to non-euro-area countries were up by a seasonallyadjusted 1
3/C254% on the first quarter in the
April-May period, the early timing of Easterthis year means that – as with industrial pro-duction and incoming orders – the stronggains recorded for April have to be relativised.It is worth noting that – despite the renewedsurge in energy prices – a relatively slow in-crease in value of
3/C254% was reported for im-
ports on a seasonally adjusted basis on anaverage of the first two months of the secondquarter; in price-adjusted terms, imports areeven likely to have declined.
The seasonally adjusted number of un-
employed persons in the euro area rosesomewhat in the second quarter of 2008, thefirst such increase to be recorded since thesecond quarter of 2005. The standardised un-employment rate rose marginally to 7.3%. Inregional terms, this development was over-whelmingly driven by unemployment inSpain, which started on its uphill path in mid-2007. Euro-area employment increased by0.3% in the first quarter of 2008 – moredetailed information is not yet available. Thistranslates into a 1.6% rise on the year.

ponds to an annualised rate of 41/C252%. The ac-
tual year-on-year rate swelled from 3.4% inthe first quarter to 3.6% in the second quar-ter. Energy prices were 6.0% higher than inthe first quarter, while food prices also accel-
erated sharply again at a seasonally adjustedrate of 1.1%. The prices of services and in-dustrial goods, however, had only a moder-ately negative impact, rising by 0.6% and0.2% respectively. Energy and overall foodprices were up by 13.6% and 5.7% respect-ively on the year. By contrast, the annual rateof inflation for services amounted to 2.4%and to 0.8% for other goods. The strong up-ward pressure on prices is therefore to dateaffecting mainly the commodity-dependentcategories of goods, namely energy andfood. However, the price pressures on the up-stream sectors of the economy have grownsignificantly over the past few months. Indus-trial producer prices for consumer durablesrose by 2.4% on the year in the first sixmonths of 2008 after having risen by 1.9% inthe second half of 2007.

21Monetary policy and
banking businessInterest rate policy and the money market
Given increased risks for price stability and a
tendency towards rising inflation expect-ations, in early July the Governing Council ofthe ECB decided to tighten the reins of mon-etary policy somewhat and therefore raisedeach of the Eurosystem’s central bank ratesby
1/C254percentage point. The minimum bid
rate for the Eurosystem’s main refinancingoperations in the form of variable rate ten-ders has since stood at 4.25%. The credit in-stitutions will now have to pay 5.25% to usethe marginal refinancing facility, while creditbalances under the deposit facility are remu-nerated at 3.25%. The money market ratesincreased correspondingly in July. Apart fromtransient and short-lived fluctuations towardsthe end of the month, the EONIA overnightrate stood at around 4.3% compared witharound 4% in the preceding months. Thelonger-term money market rates had risenalready in June in anticipation of the ECBGoverning Council’s interest rate adjustmentin early July. On average, the three-monthrates, at just under 5%, were up around0.1 percentage point on the month in June.In the run-up to the latest interest rate deci-sion, further interest rate hikes were factoredinto forward rate agreements up to the endof this year and further beyond. These ex-pectations have already receded, however.
As earlier, the rates for uncollateralised three-
month money and for longer-term moneystill contain high premiums over comparablecollateralised loans. Even a year after theonset of the financial market turmoil inAugust 2007, the situation in the euro moneyECB Governing

22Money market management and liquidity needs
During the three reserve maintenance periods from
16 April 2008 to 8 July 2008, euro-area credit institu-tions’ need for central bank liquidity determined byautonomous liquidity factors fell by 56.8 billion in
net terms. Although banknotes in circulation rosesharply, as is usual for the time of year, by a total of515.5 billion, the overall liquidity needs were re-
duced throughout the reporting period owing tothe development of the remaining autonomousfactors, with general government deposits with theEurosystem falling by a net total of 55.3 billion. In
addition, if the net foreign reserves and the otherfactors are taken together, a move which eliminatesliquidity-neutral valuation effects, an additional de-cline in the liquidity needs of 517.0 billion is appar-
ent. This was caused particularly by the sharp rise innet foreign reserves. The increase in the minimumreserve requirement caused the demand for centralbank liquidity to rise by a total of 54.9 billion.
In the three reserve maintenance periods during
the reporting period, the Eurosystem continued itspolicy, introduced in August 2007, of providingample liquidity to credit institutions in order to en-able the money markets to function with a min-imum of friction and to hold the EONIA close to theminimum bid rate. To this end, the Eurosystem con-tinued to give institutions the opportunity to fulfiltheir minimum reserve requirements at an earlystage within the reserve maintenance periods.However, overall, no more liquidity was providedthan the amount necessary to enable banks toexactly meet their reserve requirements. With re-gard to the maturity of monetary policy operations,the percentage of longer-term operations fellslightly on balance in the three reserve mainten-ance periods during the reporting period. Althoughtwo supplementary three-month refinancing oper-ations were renewed, at the same time the intend-ed operation volume for both of these special ten-ders was reduced by 510.0 billion.
In the first main refinancing operation (MRO) of
the April-May maintenance period, the ECB allottedcredit institutions 535.0 billion more than the calcu-
lative liquidity need (i.e. the benchmark), therebyproviding them with a generous supply of liquidity.In the subsequent MROs of the period, the ECB con-tinued this policy, albeit progressively reducing theauctioned amounts above the benchmark to 54.0
billion in the last MRO. In that particular mainten-ance period, the EONIA was somewhat more vola-tile; on most days, it was within a band of 10 basispoints on either side of the 4.00% minimum bidrate. The April end-of-month effect and the abun-dance of liquidity at the end of the maintenanceperiod caused a respective increase to 4.21% anddecrease to 3.73% in the EONIA. However, aliquidity-absorbing fine-tuning operation of 523.5billion on the last day of the period led to this main-
tenance period closing with an EONIA fixing of4.00%.
In the subsequent May-June maintenance period,
the ECB stayed on its chosen track and continued toallot abundant liquidity above the benchmark in itsMROs, albeit in successively smaller excess amounts.The ECB progressively reduced the above-benchmark allotments from 525.0 billion in the first
MRO of the period to 53.5 billion in the last. From
having been fixed very close to the minimum bidrate at the beginning of the period, the EONIAgradually climbed to 4.11% by the end of May. Inearly June, however, the EONIA spread (the differ-ence between the EONIA and the minimum bidrate) fell back down, totalling not more than fourbasis points in the subsequent days. It was only onthe last day of the maintenance period that theEONIA once again went up to 4.18%, although aliquidity-absorbing fine-tuning operation conduct-ed by the ECB of 514.0 billion had the proper vol-
ume and this desired volume was absorbed com-pletely.
The end-of-semester provision of liquidity to credit
institutions was the focal point of the June-Julymaintenance period. In its announcement of thefirst MRO of the period on 9 June, the ECB statedthat it “continues to closely monitor liquidity condi-tions and notes some tensions in money marketrates for maturities over the end-of-semester”, andthat it “remains ready, if needed, to smooth condi-tions around the end-of-semester”. The ECB accord-ingly allotted 520 billion above the benchmark in
each of the first two MROs. During this period, theEONIA spread was not more than four basis points.In the third MRO of the maintenance period, whichcovered the end of the semester, the ECB increasedthe above-benchmark amount to 535.0 billion in
order to ensure an ample supply of liquidity at theend of the month and the semester simultaneously.Owing to the abundance of liquidity, EONIA initial-ly fell distinctly to rates of 3.71% before then goingback up to 4.27% on the last day of the month. Atthe beginning of July, the EONIA once again fell toeight basis points below the minimum bid rate andheld firm at this level on nearly all the remainingdays in the reserve period. It was only on the lastday of the period in which the EONIA once againfell somewhat more sharply, to 3.79%, after the in-tended volume of 521.0 billion had been underbid
by56.4 billion during a liquidity-absorbing fine-
tuning operation.
In the first MRO of the July-August maintenance
period, the minimum bid rate of 4.25% adopted atthe 3 July meeting of the Governing Council of theECB took effect for the first time.

23markets has not returned to normal. In the
past few months, however, the situation haseased slightly. Unlike during the first quarterof 2008, which had still been dominated bynegative reports on European and US banks,some credit institutions initially issued surpris-ingly positive news during the second quarter.The risk premium on uncollateralised three-month money, which more than doubled by0.4 percentage point to just over 0.8 percent-age point between mid-February and mid-May, subsequently shrank again distinctly.Even the publication of news in July of thedifficulties encountered by two major USmortgage financing agencies did not causethis interest rate differential to increase anyfurther. The yield spread between the un-collateralised three-month Euribor and thecollateralised Eurepo of the same maturity iscurrently just under 0.6 percentage point.This makes it, however, still much higher thanits long-term average prior to the onset oftension on the money markets (0.06 percent-age point). It must be noted, however, thatthis interest rate spread is probably of onlylimited value for assessing risk in the moneymarket given that interbank market turnoverhas been small.
The distinct decline in the gap between the
marginal allotment rate and the minimum bidrate for main refinancing operations (MROs)can be regarded as a further cautious signalof an easing of the tensions in the euromoney market. This differential, after havingstood at up to 25 basis points prior to themeeting of the ECB Governing Councilin June, subsequently fell to below 10 basispoints before then stabilising somewhatabove that level as this report went to press.
Generous liquidity allotments during MROsonce again gave credit institutions the optionto fulfil their minimum reserve requirementsat an early stage in the minimum reservemaintenance period (frontloading). In add-ition, the Eurosystem continued to fulfilbanks’ requests for longer-term liquidity and,alongside the additional three-month refinan-cing operations, once again conducted a six-month operation in July.

On average, the overnight interest rate in the
European interbank market (the EONIA) wasalso successfully stabilised during the report-ing period at a rate close to the minimum bidrate for MROs. However, the EONIA still re-mained highly volatile up until the first MROafter the increase in the key monetary policyinterest rates. Since then, however, interestrate fluctuations have receded back to theusual levels prior to the onset of the moneymarket turmoil.
Monetary developments in the euro area
Euro-area money holdings rose again sharply
in the second quarter of 2008. The broadmonetary aggregate M3 grew at a seasonallyadjusted and annualised rate of just under8% compared with 7% in the first quarter.As in the preceding quarter, it was primarilythe components remunerated close to marketrates which increased. The reporting periodsaw a rise in deposits with an agreed maturityof up to two years, which for some time nowhave been popular not just among house-holds but also among non-financial enter-prises, and in repo transactions. This invest-ment form, which is economically compar-able to a securitised bank deposit, has beentraditionally preferred by other non-bankfinancial intermediaries.

overnight deposits being reduced during thereporting period. The latter caused the M1money stock, which comprises not just over-night money but also currency in circulation,which had grown further, to fall from April toJune by a seasonally adjusted and annualisedrate of 1.7%.
The strong growth of M3 was fostered anew
by a sizeable expansion of credit to the pri-vate sector. Although borrowing by enter-prises and individuals weakened, especiallycompared with the second half of 2007,loans to the private sector once again rosevisibly, at a seasonally adjusted and annual-ised rate of just over 7%. This is all the morestriking considering that, in June, loan securi-tisations led to extensive selling of loans tonon-bank financial intermediaries, which in
isolation caused those banks’ reported stocksof loans to the private sector to decline byaround
1/C254%, with the amount of funds pro-
vided to the relevant borrowers remainingconstant.
The unabated strong loan dynamics in the
euro area were supported once again by non-financial enterprises’ borrowing. However,the further tightening of credit standards inthe second quarter, the renewed rise in banklending rates and the imminent economicdownturn in the euro area are likely, in future,to put a damper on enterprises’ willingness toborrow additional funds from banks.

26cluding Germany, the annual growth rate of
loans to non-financial enterprises last stoodat 14.7% after a record high of 16.6% inMarch.
By contrast, the growth of bank lending to
households was sluggish as this report wentto press; this was, however, due not only tothe visibly slumping real-estate markets insome euro-area countries but also to exten-sive securitisation. Growth of loans to house-holds for house purchase, which are a primetarget for securitisation, stood at a mere an-nualised rate of 4.4% at the end of June; atthe end of March, the 12-month rate hadbeen as high as 6.1%. This was mirrored by astrong increase in credit institutions’ seasonal-ly adjusted holdings of fixed-income securitiesissued by the private sector in the quarterunder review since the banks took on thenewly created instruments in their books.Banks’ holdings of government bonds, bycontrast, stagnated, whereas institutions vis-ibly increased their loans to euro-area publicsector entities. Taken together, euro-areabanks’ lending to domestic public-sectorentities therefore was up again noticeably forthe first time since the end of 2006 – by anannualised rate of 4% in the second quarter.
Monetary capital formation in the euro area
was up noticeably in the second quarter fromthe first quarter of 2008 yet, in a long-termcomparison, remained muted during the re-porting period.

27the components of monetary capital forma-
tion, longer-term time deposits (with anagreed maturity of over two years) andlonger-term bank debt securities grew visiblyagain, unlike in the previous quarter.
In the second quarter of 2008, too, the euro-
area non-bank sector, on balance, was a netsender of large amounts of funds to foreigncountries. The attendant drop in the net ex-ternal asset position of euro-area banks, inisolation, dampened euro-area monetarygrowth, as in the first three months of theyear.
The risks to medium and long-term price
developments in the euro area resulting frommonetary developments remain high. Al-though the sharp monetary growth has tailedoff from its 2007 levels, the longer-term infla-tion forecasts based on monetary variablesremain well above the level that is associatedwith price stability by the Governing Councilof the ECB. This verdict also holds if one con-siders that the price risks emanating frommonetary developments might have beendistorted upwards by the financial marketturmoil. Monetary policy has the job of ensur-ing that the higher price risks do not lead topermanently higher inflation rates.
Deposit and lending business of German
banks with domestic customers
Monetary developments in Germany have
been marked by varying trends in banks’lending and deposit business. Whereas insti-tutions active in the German market onceagain saw relatively lively credit demand from
the corporate sector, their deposit businessgrowth subsided distinctly. The seasonally ad-justed and annualised growth rate of domes-tic non-banks’ deposits with domestic creditinstitutions fell in the second quarter of 2008to 2
1/C252% following just over 4% in the previ-
ous quarter. Short-term bank deposits, whichin the first quarter still managed to grow at aseasonally adjusted annual rate of 6
1/C252%, saw
their growth in the April-June period fall tomerely just under 4
1/C252%. In the month under
review the only net additions were in short-term time deposits (with an agreed maturityof up to two years), whereas overnight de-posits and short-term savings deposits (re-deemable at notice of up to three months)were, in some cases, reduced noticeably.Shifts within short-term bank deposits, espe-Lending and deposits of monetary

28cially by households, were also a contributory
factor. This was also the case with thosebanks that traditionally remunerate overnightmoney at relatively near-market rates.
On the whole, longer-term bank deposits
were reduced in the second quarter, a devel-opment which is probably attributable mainlyto the very flat or even inverted yield curve inthe reporting months. Although longer-termsavings deposits (redeemable at notice ofover three months) only grew at a seasonallyadjusted and annualised rate of 8% in the re-porting quarter, following just under 11% inthe previous quarter, at the same time thegrowth of the quantitatively much more im-portant longer-term time deposits (with anagreed maturity of over two years) continuedits slide. The second-quarter growth of thesedeposits was a paltry seasonally adjusted an-
nual rate of just under
1/C252%. It was particularly
insurance companies, traditionally the mostsignificant group of holders, which grew theirlonger-term time deposits visibly less exten-sively than over the same time period of thepreceding years.
Banks’ lending to their domestic private cus-
tomers once again grew strongly in thesecond quarter of 2008 following years ofstagnation up until the autumn of last year.Although lending to domestic enterprises andhouseholds only grew at a seasonally adjust-ed, annualised rate of just over 3
1/C252%, loans
to non-financial enterprises again experi-enced particularly dynamic growth. Lendingto other financial intermediaries likewisegrew strongly of late, a development due par-ticularly to large volumes of reverse repos.The situation was different for households,which once again were reluctant to borrowadditional funds from domestic banks. Onbalance, housing loans were even reducedslightly. This also impacted on the maturitystructure of lending to the private sector.Whereas longer-term unsecuritised lending,in which housing loans feature heavily, grewat a seasonally adjusted and annualised rateof only 1
1/C252% during the period under review,
the annualised growth rate of short-termloans stood at just under 16% in the secondquarter.
In addition to loans, domestic banks in-
creased their holdings of securities issued bydomestic private sector entities at a seasonal-ly adjusted annual rate of 6

30public sector securities. They elected instead
to increase their loans to domestic central,state and local government slightly for thefirst time in three years.
According to the Bank Lending Survey (BLS)
results for Germany, the expansionary trendin domestic lending to the private sector hasalso been supported by the surveyed banks’lending behaviour. Despite the persistent ten-sion in the money and credit markets duringthe quarter under review, institutions lefttheir standards in commercial banking busi-ness, on the whole, virtually unchanged.However, they perceptibly grew their marginsin this area of business – albeit at a signifi-cantly slower pace than in the precedingquarter. All in all, they were once again visiblyless restrictive than those in other euro-areacountries in how they adjusted their credit
conditions. This applied to lending to house-holds for house purchase and consumptionpurposes – for which German BLS banks, bytheir own account, largely even eased theirlending conditions – much more stronglythan it did to commercial banking business.
As has already been the case since the third
quarter of last year, the round of surveys forthe second quarter of 2008 contained someadditional questions on the isolated impact ofthe financial market turmoil on the participat-ing banks’ lending policies. The respondentsstated that the tension once again failed tohave a noticeable impact on the terms andconditions for loans to households.

31the surveyed banks’ problems in refinancing
in the money and capital markets tended tocontribute to stricter credit standards.
Bank lending rates for lending business with
non-banks largely rose during the quarterunder report in connection with the develop-ment of banks’ refinancing costs across allmaturity bands. This was especially the case
with longer-term lending to households andenterprises as a result of capital market ratesgoing back up after bottoming out in spring.Consumer loans, for which the German BLSbanks have been reporting persistently highcompetitive pressure for quite a long timealready, are the sole exception.

32Financial marketsFinancial market trends
In the second quarter of 2008, the inter-
national financial markets were dominated byongoing concern regarding the extent of thewrite-downs required in the financial sectorand increasing scepticism about the econom-ic climate. At the same time, the global priceclimate deteriorated significantly. Owing tosharp price increases for food and energyand, initially, relatively robust economic activ-ity in the euro area, inflation expectationssoared on both sides of the Atlantic. Giventhe mounting signs of stability policy risks,the Governing Council of the ECB decided toraise the interest rate by 25 basis points inJuly. As a result, yields on European govern-ment bonds rose sharply. The stock markets,which were still underpinned by companies’relatively positive results at the beginning ofthe quarter, faced pressure from an unremit-ting low risk appetite in the second quarterowing to increased anxiety about an econom-ic downturn and renewed concerns aboutthe extent of the US mortgage crisis. Theyconsequently recorded losses. On the foreignexchange markets, the euro held very firmagainst the dollar and the yen for a while, butincurred severe losses towards the end of thereporting period.
Exchange rates
As a result of changes in the assessment of
future international interest rate differentials,the euro-US dollar exchange rate trend wasinitially difficult to predict in the reportingperiod. Following the publication of unex-Financial

33pectedly high growth and inflation rates for
the euro area in May, interest rate expect-ations shifted in favour of the euro, causing itto appreciate. However, it surrendered itsgains at the start of June amid warnings fromthe Fed of inflation risks resulting from aweak US dollar. The expected change in theFed’s monetary policy seemed to be support-ed by relatively favourable data for US retailsales, which additionally strengthened theposition of the US dollar against key curren-cies.
The US dollar faced renewed downward pres-
sure in mid-June when various GoverningCouncil representatives indicated that aninterest rate increase was likely at the nextmeeting owing to mounting inflation risks inthe euro area. The Eurosystem’s interest ratemove at the beginning of July had thereforebeen largely expected by the markets and didnot have any additional direct impact on theeuro-US dollar exchange rate. Discussionsabout the feared insolvency of several majorUS mortgage financiers subsequently subject-ed the US real estate market crisis to in-creased scrutiny from investors, thereby put-ting pressure on the US dollar. The euro-USdollar exchange rate briefly reached a newall-time high of US$1.60 in mid-July. Recentspeculation that the Federal Reserve wouldsoon hike its interest rates, based on the pub-lication of the minutes of the precedingFOMC meeting at which several membersspoke out in favour of raising interest rates,subsequently strengthened the US dollar. Fur-thermore, market participants perceived theeconomic risks for the euro area to be higher,which put even more pressure on the euro-dollar exchange rate. As this report went to
press, the euro was trading at US$1.49, justunder 1
1/C252% up on the beginning of the year.
Contrary to the changing interest rate expect-
ations in the euro area and the US, the mar-ket expected, throughout the reportingperiod, that the Bank of Japan would main-tain its neutral monetary policy in Japan forsome time to come, thus compounding theLog scale

34interest rate disadvantage of the yen. The
euro therefore initially also further appreci-ated against the yen. This trend was givenfurther momentum at the start of July follow-ing the publication of the Bank of Japan’sTankan survey, which indicated that the busi-ness climate of key enterprises in Japan’smanufacturing sector had deteriorated sharp-ly in the second quarter. On 23 July, the euroreached its highest level to date since thelaunch of EMU, trading at ¥170. As this re-port went to press, however, it had fallen to¥163, 1% lower than at the beginning of theyear.
The euro mostly fluctuated within a narrow
range of between £0.78 and £0.80 againstthe pound sterling in the reporting period.Owing to high inflationary pressure in the UKand increasing inflation expectations, themarkets did not expect the Bank of Englandto continue easing its monetary policy, des-pite the weak economy. In fact, the interestrate has remained unchanged since it waslast reduced in April. As this report went topress, the euro was trading at just under£0.80, around 8
1/C252% higher than at the be-
ginning of the year.
Against other key currencies, however, the
euro has lost ground perceptibly since mid-March. It incurred significant losses againstthe Hungarian forint (-8
1/C252%), the Chinese
renmimbi (-8%) and the Polish zloty (-6%).The value of the euro against the Slovak kor-una (the central rate of which was raised byover 17
1/C252% within the context of ERM II with
effect from 29 May) also fell in the reportingperiod (-7%). The euro’s average rate againstthe 22 major currencies in the exchange rate
index has therefore fallen by 2
1/C252% since the
end of March. In real terms, too, ie taking ac-count of the simultaneous inflation differen-tials between the euro area and its majortrading partners, the effective exchange rateof the euro fell slightly in the reportingperiod. The euro was still 10
1/C252% higher than
at the launch of currency union, however.
Securities markets and portfolio
transactions
In the spring and early summer, the European
bond market was caught between increasedinflationary pressure, on the one hand, andgrowing concerns about the economy as wellas resurgent fears regarding the effects of thefinancial market turbulence, on the other.The global inflation outlook deteriorated,mainly owing to reports of rising food andenergy prices. At the same time, a number ofrobust economic indicators initially pointed toa stable economic situation in Germany andthe euro area. As a result, yields on ten-yeareuro-area government bonds rose by aroundthree-quarters of a percentage point to al-most 5% at the beginning of July. As well ashigher long-term inflation expectations, thisdevelopment also led to a rise in the long-term real interest rate which, expressed asthe yield on index-linked bonds, temporarilyrose to just over 2
1/C254%. However, unfavour-
able economic data for the euro area andGermany put renewed pressure on Europeancapital market interest rates, primarily shorterand medium-term maturities in nominal andreal terms, in July. As this report went to...and against

35press, yields on ten-year euro-area govern-
ment bonds amounted to just under 41/C252%.
As capital market interest rates increased, the
financing conditions for European enterpriseson the bond market also tended to deterior-ate in the second quarter. Their earnings out-look, in particular, was assessed less favour-ably by the market. However, the spreads forcorporate bonds rated BBB (the lowestinvestment-grade category) against euro-areagovernment bonds, after reaching recordhighs towards the end of the first quarter,narrowed somewhat, by 13 basis points to295 basis points at the end of the reportingperiod. The fact that interest rate premiumsremain high reflects the continued low riskappetite of market participants and substan-tial liquidity premiums. It also indicates that,compared with interest rate premiums, pre-miums on the relatively liquid market forcredit risk transfer have fallen a bit moresharply.
Uncertainty in the financial markets and in-
vestors’ pronounced risk aversion had a con-siderable effect on issuing activity in somesegments of the German bond market in thesecond quarter of 2008. A record volume ofGerman debt securities ( 3401 billion) were
sold after having already peaked once in theprevious quarter ( 3391 billion). However, is-
suers only raised just under 31 billion net on
the capital market after likewise high re-demptions and changes to holdings of theirown bonds. In the previous quarter, as muchas312 billion worth of German debt secur-
ities had been placed in the German market.Sales of foreign debt securities and moneymarket paper also fell in Germany ( 324 billion
from 332
1/C252billion), although individual in-
struments did buck the general trend, with agreater volume of euro-denominated bondsissued by non-resident public and private is-suers being sold on the German market(331
1/C252billion) for the first time since the
onset of the financial market turbulence. Bycontrast, interest-bearing securities denomin-ated in foreign currency fell ( 37
1/C252billion) fol-
lowing 3411/C252billion worth of purchases by
German counterparties between July 2007and March 2008 of those issues which areoften traded as asset-backed securities (ABS).Overall, German bond market issuance thustotalled around 325 billion in the second

36The public sector was the only group of Ger-
man issuers to record inflows of funds afterredemptions and changes to holdings of itsown bonds. From April to June, however –also partly due to the positive cash balance –it raised only 33
1/C252billion in the capital mar-
ket, an amount comparable to that of thefirst three months of this year. The state gov-ernments increased their bond market debtslightly on the previous quarter ( 33 billion),
while the Federal Government raised very lit-tle on the capital market (just under 3
1/C252bil-
lion net). In the longer-term maturity range,however, it issued ten-year Federal bonds(Bunds) totalling 36
1/C252billion, including
inflation-indexed debt securities, which areconsidered especially worthwhile from anissuer’s perspective if the price climate ex-ceeds the expectations held on the issue dateby the bond underwriters. Furthermore, the
Federal Government issued a combined37 billion worth of two-year Federal Treasury
notes ( 31 billion) and redeemed thirty-year
Bunds, five-year Federal notes and savingsnotes, Federal Treasury discount paper(Bubills) and Federal Treasury financing paper.
Credit institutions, by contrast, removed
31 billion net of their own bonds and money
market instruments from circulation. Sincethe beginning of the crisis in the second quar-ter of 2007, they have therefore reducedtheir capital market debt by 316
1/C252billion. The
development in the previous quarter wascaused by redemptions of public Pfandbriefe(311 billion) and mortgage Pfandbriefe ( 32 bil-
lion), circulation of which has been falling forsome time. The turnaround in flexible otherbank debt securities was also notable. Fromthe creation of the euro area until mid-2007,the average net quarterly issue volume was311
1/C252billion; by contrast, the reporting quar-
ter was the second consecutive quarter of netredemptions ( 32
1/C252billion after 36 billion in
the first three months of this year). Sales ofdebt securities by specialised credit institu-tions remained more or less on a par with theprevious quarter ( 314 billion compared with
313
1/C252billion). Their issue volume rose signifi-
cantly at the beginning of the year when a fi-nancial institution relocated the departmentsresponsible for issuing business to Germany.
Non-financial enterprises also reduced their
capital market liabilities on a net basis ( 31 bil-
lion). Although they issued 34

of longer-term debt instruments, they alsovigorously redeemed money market paperNet redemptions: −

37between April and June; such instruments
had momentarily attracted little interest frominvestors in the financial markets since theoutbreak of the tensions.
Non-resident investors, again, actively ac-
quired debt securities in the second quarterof 2008. They bought public debt instru-ments totalling 327 billion exclusively in May
and June, when investors looking for secureand liquid instruments obviously favouredGerman government bonds. Statistics alsoshow that non-residents invested largeamounts in private issuers’ bonds ( 330
1/C252bil-
lion). However, many of these cross-bordertransactions involved certificates and war-rants created in Germany which were sold enbloc to affiliated companies abroad and heldthere, in most cases, until maturity. Ultimate-ly, only a fraction of documented purchasesby private investors were transacted outsidethe banking sector, the actual target group ofthese products.
1German investors, in con-
trast, disposed of interest-bearing securitieson balance. The sales were solely attributableto German non-banks which unloaded debtsecurities totalling 370 billion net.
2Domestic
credit institutions, on the other hand, in-creased their bond market exposures by333
1/C252billion; just under two-thirds of this
amount was spent on foreign debt securities.
The stock market recovery which began to-
wards the end of the first quarter of 2008continued until mid-May. Signs of a potentialeasing of tensions on the credit markets, rela-tively robust quarterly results and the successof a number of large financial institutions inraising loans initially boosted prices. However,rising crude oil prices and renewed concern
about write-downs in the financial sector, inparticular, then led to losses, the brunt ofwhich was borne by financial institutions.Moreover, the closure of a US mortgageMonthly data

38Deuts che Bun desbankConstru ctin g an a ggregate risk appetite in dicator with a prin cipal component analysis
In an analysis of capital markets, various market- base d 
indicators can be use d to measure an d assess the risk 
appetite of the market players. Examples of in dicators 
that are base d on credit risk se curities su ch as bon ds or 
credit derivatives are interest rate premiums on un certain 
corporate debt se curities an d credit default swap ( CDS) 
premiums, the size of whi ch – alon gside other fa ctors 
– (inversely) depen ds on the risk appetite. Another in di-
cator that is frequently use d is the implie d volatility on 
the sto ck market, whi ch is calculate d usin g option pri ces 
and expresses un certainty re garding future pri ce devel-
opments. Other in dicators fo cus on the su bjectively per-
ceive d safety of certain assets. The un derlyin g hypothesis 
is that, in times of un certainty, investors shift their assets 
to “safe havens”. An example of su ch an in dicator is the 
time-varia bly measure d correlation of returns on sto cks 
and government bon ds, whi ch reﬂ  ects the extent of su ch 
a ﬂ ight to safety.
It is often difﬁ cult to interpret in dividual in dicators 
because they are also affe cted by a num ber of other 
factors that are unrelate d to risk appetite. This has been 
highlighte d by the re cent ﬁ  nan cial market tur bulen ce, 
in parti cular, with differen ces in tra ding activity an d 
the liqui dity of in dividual ﬁ  nan cial instruments makin g 
it more difﬁ cult to infer information re garding the risk 
propensity of the market players. While the VDAX volatil-
ity in dex, for example, was below its lon g-term avera ge 
at the turn of 2007-08 (with quotations now re coverin g), 
BBB-rate d interest rate premiums on corporate bon ds 
– whi ch, followin g the tur bulen ce, still containe d size-
able liqui dity premiums – rose si gniﬁ cantly a bove the 
histori cal avera ge an d in dicate d a low risk appetite. 
The sometimes low liqui dity of in dividual markets an d 
ﬁ nan cial instruments therefore makes it a dvisa ble not to 
rely on a sin gle in dicator when assessin g risk appetite.The prin cipal component analysis ena bles several sin gle 
indicators to be a ggregate d to form a composite in dica-
tor. This is a statisti cal metho d that extra cts common 
time-varyin g determinants from several correlate d vari-
ables. Ea ch determinant is a linear com bination of the 
varia bles in cluded. In most cases only one or two com-
mon fa ctors are consi dere d, as these generally explain 
the majority of the total varian ce of all the varia bles 
included. Ideally, the inﬂ  uen ce of risk appetite, whi ch 
appears in all the varia bles un der consi deration, can thus 
be separate d from the other spe ciﬁ c determinants that 
are only relevant for in dividual varia bles. The in dividual 
indicators in cluded in the followin g prin cipal component 
analysis are base d on sto ck markets, bon d markets an d 
CDS markets. The in clusion of CDS premiums broa dens 
the base of the a ggregate d indicator an d, in comparison 
with previous stu dies, represents an important step for-
war d.1 Speciﬁ cally, durin g the 1 July 2004 to 31 July 2008 
reportin g perio d, the followin g varia bles were in cluded 
(the expe cted inﬂ uen ce on risk appetite is given in

At just over 77 %, the ﬁ  rst prin cipal component explains 
a relatively hi gh per centa ge of the total varian ce. All the 
varia bles in cluded are in corporate d in the ﬁ  rst prin cipal 
component with the expe cted sign (+/-) an d with similar 
wei ghtin gs. This means that all the in dividual in dicators 
are a dequately represente d in the ﬁ  rst prin cipal com-
ponent. By contrast, the se con d prin cipal component 
provi des little a dditional explanation an d is therefore 
not consi dere d further.3 Overall, this su ggests that the 
ﬁ rst prin cipal component reﬂ  ects the risk appetite well.4
Risk appetite, in turn, represents an important explana-
tory fa ctor for sto ck pri ces in Germany.
According to the in dicator, in sprin g 2005, in conne ction 
with For d an d General Motors bein g down graded by the 
Stan dard & Poor’s ratin g agency, an d in summer 200 6, 
when the sto ck markets of emer ging market e conomies, 
in parti cular, sustaine d heavy losses, market players’ risk 
appetite temporarily fell below the zero line – whi ch 
correspon ds to the reportin g perio d avera ge – but was 
otherwise positive, without any su bstantial ﬂ  uctuations, 
until mi d-2007 (see chart). In this environment chara cter-
ise d by an a bove-avera ge risk appetite, the sto ck pri ces 
– as measure d here on the broa d CDAX in dex – rose 
sharply. Furthermore, the in dicator also tra ces the devel-
opment of per ceive d risk sin ce the onset of the ﬁ  nan cial 
market tur bulen ce in summer 2007 an d su ggests that 
the severe slump in sto ck pri ces was due not only to 
poor fun damentals, but also to the sharp fall in risk 
appetite. Followin g a temporary calm perio d in autumn 
2007, in mi d-Mar ch of this year risk appetite bottome d 
out, fallin g well out of the ± 2 stan dard deviations ran ge 
(dotte d lines). At the current en d, the in dicator is on ce again below this ran ge, thus continuin g to in dicate that 
market players’ risk appetite is very low.

40bank, growing anxiety about the soundness
of government-sponsored US real estate fi-nanciers and worse-than-expected economicindicators created gloom among market par-ticipants. Against this backdrop, in which therisk appetite of market participants was low,the US government’s announcement of its in-tention to provide assistance to US real estatefinanciers, the unexpectedly positive quarterlyresults of some US banks and the drop in theoil price had a stabilising effect on prices. Ul-timately, US and German equities have, sinceApril, fallen by 3% and 5%, respectively, asmeasured by the S&P 500 and CDAX broadmarket indices, while the European DowJones EuroStoxx has slipped by 9%.
Against the backdrop of share price losses, is-
suing activity in the domestic stock market re-mained weak in the second quarter. Domestic
enterprises placed 31
1/C252billion worth of new
shares, compared with 31 billion in the third
quarter. Half of these were issued by listedcompanies. Moreover, residents sold foreignshares for 38
1/C252billion net.
From April to June, German non-banks repre-
sented the only group of buyers on the stockmarket with 353
1/C252billion; they mainly traded
in domestic securities. Banks, in contrast, di-vested themselves of 33
1/C252billion worth of
shares. Non-resident investors also sold Ger-man equities amounting to 346
1/C252billion.
These sales were probably in connection withthe run-up to the respective dividend pay-ment dates.
Domestic investment companies recorded in-
flows of funds totalling 34 billion in the
second quarter, compared with fund out-flows of 35
1/C252billion in the preceding three
months. The money was invested in both spe-cial funds reserved for institutional investors(33 billion) and mutual funds open to the
general public ( 31 billion). Of the mutual
funds open to the general public, balancedfunds and mixed securities funds sold themost certificates ( 32 billion each), followed
by equity-based funds and open-end real es-tate funds ( 31 billion each). However, money
market funds also saw capital outflows ( 33
1/C252
billion), as did – to a lesser extent – bond-
based funds and mixed securities funds(31 billion and 3
1/C252billion respectively). In add-
ition, net sales of foreign mutual fund shareson the German market totalled 34 billion.Investment activity in the German

41In the second quarter, mutual fund shares
were purchased exclusively by domestic non-banks ( 310 billion), which chiefly added mu-
tual fund shares issued by foreign investmentcompanies to their portfolios ( 37
1/C252billion).
Non-residents invested 31 billion in German
mutual fund shares. By contrast, resident andnon-resident credit institutions sold mutualfund shares ( 33
1/C252billion).
Foreign direct investment
Foreign direct investment saw net capital ex-
ports of 3291/C252billion in the second quarter.
Capital outflows were therefore lower thanthose of the first quarter. The lower level ofoverall activity in foreign direct investment isin line with the decrease in cross-border mer-gers and acquisitions (M&A) with German in-volvement in the reporting period.
German companies which provided their for-
eign branches with additional funds of 335
1/C252
billion made a large contribution to capital
outflows within the context of foreign directinvestment. They primarily increased capitalstakes in foreign companies ( 322 billion), the
principal destinations being Spain and the US.Here, a major transaction in the energy sectorplayed a significant role. In addition, however,reinvested earnings ( 37 billion) and foreign
direct investment loans to affiliates ( 37 billion)
played their part.
In the second quarter, foreign proprietors fur-
nished their German subsidiaries with an add-itional 36 billion, of which equity capital ac-
counted for around half.Major items of the balance of

42Economic conditions
in GermanyMacroeconomic situation
Following decidedly strong growth at the be-
ginning of the year, overall economic activityin Germany slowed down perceptibly in thesecond quarter of 2008. According to theflash estimate of the Federal Statistical Office,real GDP between April and June was 0.5%down on the first quarter after adjustmentfor seasonal and calendar effects. This figurealready takes into account the fact that GDPgrowth in the first quarter, at 1.3%, wassomewhat weaker than initially reported. Ac-cording to the figures now available, eco-nomic output was 1.7% up on the year aftercalendar adjustment, compared with 2.6% inthe previous quarter.
The decline in overall economic output in the
reporting quarter should be seen primarily inthe context of the very high level of output inthe first quarter when, owing to a number ofspecial factors in the production sector, theGerman economy grew very sharply.
1As ex-
pected, economic growth in the second quar-ter was significantly dampened by matchingcounter-reactions. In the first half of 2008 – areference period which is more meaningfulfrom an analytical perspective – seasonallyand calendar-adjusted GDP , at an annualisedrate of 1
1/C252%, nevertheless almost reached
the level of potential growth, which meantthat overall capacity utilisation was quitelargely maintained during this period. Nega-tive cyclical factors are likely to have intensi-fied towards the middle of the year, however.

43Although there is currently no detailed infor-
mation available on the use of GDP in thesecond quarter, the indicators do suggest,however, that domestic demand declined inthe reporting period on the whole. The weakgrowth in retail sales, for example, indicatesthat private consumption was again dampen-ed discernibly. According to the consumerresearch institution, Gesellschaft f/C252r Konsum-
forschung (GfK), consumer sentiment deteri-
orated perceptibly once more in the secondquarter. This was due mainly to the renewedsurges in the cost of energy and persistentlyhigh food prices. Households’ real scope forexpenditure is being substantially restrictedby the current pace of inflation. The gloomierprice climate is also likely to have been a keyreason for the income outlook being assessedas clearly less favourable of late – despite apositive trend in the labour market and high-er negotiated wages in this year’s pay round.Further news of ongoing problems in theinternational financial markets is also likely tohave increasingly fuelled concerns about theeconomy. As a result, consumers’ propensityto purchase has again fallen almost to thelevel measured in the second quarter of 2005before the current upswing gained momen-tum.
On the income side, the expectation that
private consumption could take off and grad-ually push the economic cycle into a newphase had been perfectly justified since thebeginning of the recovery in the labour mar-ket just over two years ago. The fact that pri-vate consumption was virtually stagnatingduring this period, however, was not duesolely to the inflation-induced loss of purchas-ing power, but also, in part, to a high level of
saving. The emergence of external priceshocks from the summer of 2007 onwards,for example, is likely to have given rise togrowing concern, as time went on, that theloss of purchasing power might persist overthe longer term. Furthermore, the announce-ment of further energy price rises may havecaused some households to be more cautiouswith regard to the purchase of consumer dur-ables. This particularly affected the buying ofpassenger cars, especially in view of the sharprise in the price of petrol. In addition, the de-bate on the reform of motor vehicle tax inGermany as well as the planned EU climateprotection provisions for passenger cars mayhave prompted a number of households toput off purchasing a new vehicle.

44senger cars to private individuals showed a
perceptible fall in the first half of 2008.According to the national accounts data, be-tween the beginning of 2006 and the firstquarter of 2008 moderate growth wasrecorded in other consumer durables andservices, whereas households deliberatelyreduced their purchases of goods whichshowed higher-than-average price rises.Prices of non-durable goods, for example,went up roughly twice as sharply during thisperiod as the prices of all other areas of ex-penditure combined. This was due, not least,to sharp price rises in the case of food andfuel. In the same period, real expenditure onnon-durable goods, which accounted for asmuch as 28% of all domestic consumptionexpenditure, declined by just over 6%.
Demand for new housing was adversely
affected by a lack of follow-up orders in thewake of the special developments in 2006when, owing to the abolition of the grant tohomebuyers and the announced increase inVAT, a comparatively large number of con-struction projects were realised. Althoughthere has been a decline in job risk, bringingat least some improvement in income pro-spects and a consequent easing of banks’lending conditions, private housing construc-tion has become hardly more affordable.Construction services, for instance, have be-come considerably more expensive since2006 following years in which the price trendhad been virtually stagnant. Financing costshave also gone up. By contrast, housing rentshave been raised at a very subdued pace inmany places, and prices of older housinghave remained unchanged. Up to the end ofthe period under review, the volume of per-
mits and orders for housing remained at avery depressed level. By contrast, in line withthe current cyclical pattern, the underlyingtrend in industrial and public sector construc-tion stayed on an upward course, eventhough a significant decline may be expectedfor the second quarter in seasonally andcalendar-adjusted terms. In purely nominalterms, this was due mainly to a countermove-ment of a more technical nature since con-struction activity in the winter months hadbenefited to a great extent from weatherconditions. Nevertheless, the rebound effectis also likely to have been due, in part, toorders since the beginning of the year failingto match the surge in demand in the finalquarter of 2007.
Demand for machinery and equipment slack-
ened in the second quarter following a periodwith some strong increases. Given theexchange-rate-induced losses in earnings,surges in the cost of intermediate goods, anda renewed acceleration in wage costs, enter-prises are likely to have become more cau-tious in making new acquisitions. Followingthe sharp build-up in capacity over the pasttwo and a half years, a certain amount ofcaution was probably appropriate anyway,especially as the noticeable slowdown in theflow of orders since the beginning of the yeartemporarily eased the pressure for a rapidexpansion of production capacity. This is allthe more the case given that export-orientedfirms, of which there are a large number, arecurrently faced with less favourable exportexpectations.

45According to the data available so far, exports
of goods and services are likely to havedeclined somewhat in real terms in thesecond quarter. The total value of exports ofgoods was down
1/C252% on the first quarter
after seasonal adjustment, although therewere noticeable regional differences. Whilethe decline in exports to the euro area andAsia was still comparatively moderate on thewhole, exports to the United States, in par-ticular, as well as to the UK, showed a percep-tible fall. This development reflects not onlythe economic downturn in these economies,but also the fact that German exporters wereincreasingly feeling the effect of the euro’songoing appreciation against both theUS dollar and the pound sterling up to July.On the whole, foreign trade still made a posi-tive contribution to growth in the secondquarter since imports declined more sharplythan exports. Nominal imports of goods inthe second quarter were a seasonally adjust-ed 1
3/C254% down on the quarter. German en-
terprises’ investment, which has been moresubdued of late, as well as households’ recentconsumption restraint, are also likely to haveplayed a role in this development. Added tothis was the moderation in inventories, whichis to be seen more as a technical reactionfollowing a very sharp build-up of stocks inthe first quarter.

4611/C252% down on the first quarter in seasonally
adjusted terms. Although hardly any indus-trial sector remained unaffected by theslowdown, it is still striking that manufactur-ers of consumer goods significantly cut backtheir output, while, in the capital goods sec-tor, the decline was comparatively moderate.Evidently, given the considerable orders stillon the books, manufacturers of machineryand equipment, were still able to maintaintheir production volume at a high level, even
though it was precisely this sector which hadrecorded the sharpest decline in new orderssince the beginning of the year.
In capacity utilisation, this same picture is
apparent in terms of the overall trend as wellas at the sectoral level. According to Ifo Insti-tute data, overall industrial capacity utilisationdeclined significantly at the mid-year pointfollowing two years of record highs. Never-theless, utilisation was not only well above itslong-term average, but also above the peaklevel achieved during the last business cycle inthe second quarter of 2000. While manu-facturers of capital and intermediate goodswere still reporting quite a high level of cap-acity utilisation, increasing spare capacity wasbecoming apparent in the consumer goodssector.
Output in the construction sector between
April and June was a seasonally adjusted 8%down on the level of the first quarter. Thisvery sharp decline is, however, to be seen inthe context of an even sharper increase in theprevious quarter. The marked peak in outputat the beginning of the year was linked to themild early-winter weather, which was condu-cive to the speedy processing of the surge inorders received in the fourth quarter of 2007.With regard to the overall weak situation inorders since the turn of the year, it should benoted, however, that the underlying trend inconstruction output has not picked up fromits low prior-year level.

47in the services sector in the second quarter.
Following the moderate upturn in the firstquarter, sales activity in the retail trade wasagain weak at the end of the period under re-view with the extremely high prices for fuelsnot only leading to a decline in sales at petrolstations, but also affecting sales by motorvehicle traders. Wholesale turnover shot up inthe first quarter not least owing to buoyantforeign trade activity and strong procurementactivity by industrial enterprises, but fell backdown below the level of the second half of2007 in the period under review. Similar fac-tors are also likely to have had a dampeningeffect in the transport and logistics sector re-cently. According to the Ifo Institute surveys,the business climate trend for providers ofbusiness-related services between April andJune largely paralleled the gloomier ratings inthe manufacturing sector. By contrast, thecredit reform/ZEW survey among ICT serviceproviders, tax advisors, auditors, architectsand advertising firms presented a picture ofconsistently positive sentiment in the first halfof the year.
Employment and unemployment
Despite weaker economic activity, there was
a further increase in employment in thesecond quarter of 2008, albeit on a notice-ably reduced scale. The seasonally adjustednumber of persons in work went up by76,000, or 0.2%, on the quarter, comparedwith an increase of 0.5% in the first threemonths of the year.

48the improved labour market situation. The
level achieved in May – more recent data arenot yet available – was also 0.2% up on Feb-ruary. Business services, which also includesthe hiring out of labour, accounted for overhalf of this growth. The number of personsworking exclusively on a part-time low-income basis remained virtually unchangedat 4.83 million. There was a slight seasonallyadjusted increase in the case of government-assisted employment opportunities (one-eurojobs). Employment was therefore up by567,000 persons, or 1.4%, on the year.
The fall in unemployment largely matched
the rise in employment. At a seasonally ad-justed -69,000, the decline in unemploymentwas, however, significantly weaker than inthe first quarter when it had stood at209,000. It is noteworthy that, for the firsttime in a long while, there was a slight in-crease in the number of unemployed personsin category SGB III (statutory insurancescheme), although changes to benefits legis-lation also played a part in this.
2By contrast,
the decline in unemployment in the categorySGB II (basic allowance system) continued atan unreduced pace when compared with thefirst quarter of 2008. The unemploymentrate, as defined nationally, went down from
8.0% in the first quarter of 2008 to 7.9% inthe second quarter; the standardised rate fellfrom 7.5% to 7.4%. In July, there was a fur-ther slight decline in registered unemploy-ment. As in June, the relevant rate stood at7.8%.
The available leading indicators suggest that
the improvement in the labour market willcontinue at a more moderate pace. The num-ber of vacancies reported to the labour ex-changes showed a further fall in the secondquarter. The number of positions to be filledimmediately with their associated vacancyperiods was nevertheless still quite high,however. According to surveys by the Insti-tute for Employment Research (IAB), thenumber of vacancies in the primary labourmarket declined by one-tenth on the yearoverall. The Ifo employment barometer fortrade and industry also shows that the pro-pensity of enterprises to recruit new staff isless favourable than before. Following a longperiod of increase, the BA-X index, whichcovers all non-government-assisted jobs re-ported to the Federal Employment Agency,showed a slight fall at the end of the periodunder review. On average, however, enter-prises’ staffing policies are still likely to beexpansionary. This is also evident from theresults of the DIHK survey carried out in theearly summer of 2008.

2The seasonal short-time working benefits in the con-
struction sector, which led to a reduction in the number
of unemployed persons in the first quarter and the effects
of which cannot yet be fully excluded from the seasonally
adjusted figures, are likely to have contributed to the
quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted slowdown in em-
ployment growth and the decline in unemployment, es-
pecially in category SGB III. Furthermore, in nominal
terms, there was an increase in the number of un-
employed persons owing to the discontinuation of the

49tors in the first four months of 2008, only a
few new pay settlements were completed to-wards the end of the second quarter or at thebeginning of the third quarter. The pay agree-ment for employees working for central andlocal government was largely implementedfor civil servants, too, and was also adoptedby a number of state governments. In theutilities sector (electricity, gas and districtheating), various agreements were concluded,typically consisting of two-stage settlementsrunning for longer periods. In the case ofsalaried employees at cooperative banks, thetrade unions DBV and DHV concluded a wageagreement for the first time without the usualinvolvement of Ver.di. This agreement iseffective retrospectively for the past two yearsand will remain valid for a further two years. Itcomprises a 3.0% salary increase, which willcome into effect in the fourth quarter of2008, followed by a further increase of 2.0%in the fourth quarter of 2009. After retail sec-tor wage negotiations, which went on overthe period of one year, the wage-bargainingarea of Baden-W/C252rttemberg reached anagreement lasting 12 months. This envisagesa retrospective pay increase of 3.0% with ef-fect from April 2008 and a retrospective flat-rate payment of 3400 for the 12 months prior
to that. This agreement has since been adopt-ed by other wage-bargaining areas. The year-on-year rise in negotiated rates of pay wentdown from a total of 2.7% in the first quarterof 2008 to 1.7% in the second quarter.
3This
was due primarily to base effects of non-repeated one-off payments from the year2007. The trend in negotiated wages is betterreflected in the negotiated basic rates of pay.These went up 3.4% on the year, comparedwith 3.1% in the first quarter. In the second
quarter, the acceleration in negotiated wagesis also likely to have been reflected in morerapidly rising national unit labour costs.
On the price side, events were marked by the
sharp rises in crude oil prices in the worldmarkets across all trade levels in the secondquarter of 2008. As a result, external pressureon prices increased discernibly in this period.Seasonally adjusted import prices were up bya total of 3.0% on the quarter, comparedwith 2.0% in the first three months of theyear. The vast majority of this increase is at-tributable to the energy component, the costof which rose by just under 13% on the quar-Year-on-year change, on monthly basis

50ter in seasonally adjusted terms. In the case
of other goods, price inflation, at a seasonallyadjusted 0.6%, was almost as strong as inthe first quarter, despite the continuing ap-preciation of the euro. Food prices, however,have shown signs of a certain easing follow-ing very sharp price increases in this area.Owing to the greater share of crude oil prod-ucts, the overall year-on-year rise in importprices, at 7.5%, was far greater than that inexports (2.4%). As a result, there was a fur-ther deterioration in the terms of trade.
Owing to the sharp rise in energy prices, the
(quarter-on-quarter) increase in the industrialproducer prices of goods intended for domes-tic sale went up from a seasonally adjusted1.6% in the first quarter of 2008 to 2.4% inthe second quarter. If energy is excluded, theincrease, at 0.9%, was just as high as in theprevious period. As a result of slight down-ward revisions in the case of domestic agricul-tural producer prices and declining pricetrends in the world markets, price increases inthe food and drinks industry showed amarked fall. Factory gate price inflation alsoeased in the case of other consumer goods.By contrast, it increased in the case of inter-mediate goods. The overall year-on-year in-crease in industrial factory gate prices wentup from 3.8% in the first quarter to 6.0% inthe second quarter of 2008. Prices for con-struction work were up 3.6% on the year.

51over half of this was attributable to the en-
ergy component, which increased by 4.4%.The price of heating oil went up by almost20% on the quarter and fuel by more than7%. By contrast, there was an easing of up-ward pressure on food prices, which was alsodue to the fact that the expected downwardcorrections occurred in the case of dairy prod-ucts. The price of milk went down by approxi-mately 5%,
4for example, with farm cheese
(Speisequark ) and cream becoming some 6%
cheaper. The price of butter went down sub-stantially, as in the previous quarter. The rateof price increase for bread and cereals alsoweakened. The prices of industrial products,services and housing rents went up by 0.3%overall and therefore just as rapidly as in theprevious quarter. Despite the sharp rise inprices on a quarterly comparison, the year-on-year increase in the consumer price index(CPI) remained unchanged at 2.9%.
5Energy
prices were 12.4% up on the year. Con-sumers even had to pay just over half asmuch again for heating oil. The rate of foodprice inflation went up to 7.6%, despite afew partial downward corrections. By con-trast, the annual rate of inflation for goods(excluding energy), at 0.8%, for services, at1.3%, and for housing rents, at 1.4%, wererather subdued. Year-on-year HICP inflationwent down from 3.1% to 3.0%.
6The seasonally adjusted rise in consumerprices in July was somewhat more subduedthan in the two preceding months. The an-nual CPI rate remained at the prior-monthlevel of 3.3%, whereas the annual HICP raterose to 3.5%. Upward pressure on energyprices weakened despite a further increase inthe cost of refined petroleum products, gasand electricity. The increase in the cost of ser-vices was somewhat sharper and the usualseasonal decline in the price of food productsfailed to materialise. Given the increasinglyabundant supply of agricultural products, it islikely that there will be a certain easing ofpressure in the coming months. Fuel andheating oil will probably also become cheaperagain owing to corrections to the price ofcrude oil. In the case of gas, further sharpprice rises have been announced, however.There could be a slight overall moderation inthe year-on-year rate of consumer price infla-tion, although it is likely to remain wellabove 2%.
Orders received and outlook
The scale of the decline in overall economic
output in the second quarter was due, to aconsiderable extent, to negative specialeffects. Nevertheless, this GDP result indicatesa more mixed macroeconomic constellation,which, after a fairly long period of rapid eco-nomic growth, has come more to the forerecently. This does not, however, point to afundamental deterioration in the overall eco-nomic situation nor does it imply a loss of thecyclical resilience that has been regained overthe past few years. Nevertheless, in addition
4Owing to the increased supply of milk, price reductions
for fresh milk were considerably greater in May than in
the previous quarter. However, owing to the milk delivery
strike at the beginning of June, some of the corrections
were reversed again.
5The introduction of tuition fees in a number of federal
states in the second quarter of 2007 contributed 0.2 per-
centage point to this price increase.

52to the ongoing uncertainties and the global
challenges which have yet to be resolved,further negative factors emerged in the firsthalf of 2008. Consequently, the aggregate“risk mix” that has been built up is now nolonger without a perceptible impact on Ger-many’s economic development.
This is particularly true of the energy-price
and inflation-related strains which not onlyhave an adverse effect on domestic consump-tion, but also on economic activity in majorGerman export markets. For one thing, themassive increase in the cost of energy hasmeant that the developed economies haveexperienced considerable losses in real in-come in the past few years. (Data for the Ger-man economy may be found in the explana-tory notes on “Energy bill for the Germaneconomy under increasing price pressure” onpages 54-55.) Secondly, adverse effects onpotential overall economic output may be ex-pected in connection with this. For example,owing to a lack of scope for passing throughhigher prices, enterprises may, on costgrounds, be forced to cut back their energyuse. For technical reasons, this can initially beaccomplished only by reducing output. This,in turn, affects demand for other productionfactors. Furthermore, the value of productioncapacity that is, in fact, still available isreduced by the high energy prices, since thelack of energy efficiency means that it is nolonger economical. Not least, an additionalcapital devaluation effect may occur as therewill be less market demand for energy-inten-sive capital and durable goods. The aggregateoutput gap will therefore probably tend toreact less strongly to the energy price shockVolume, 2000 = 100,

53than might be expected for cyclical reasons
alone. The cyclical price-dampening effectsare therefore also likely to be correspondinglymoderate.
Moreover, the current accumulation of shocks
has led to fairly large revisions of shorter-termexpectations recently. Thus, the considerabledeterioration in enterprises’ and households’sentiment in the second quarter also has tobe seen in connection with the fact that theprice surge in the energy and commoditymarkets in the first half of the year attainedunprecedented levels in terms of both scaleand pace. In the case of extrapolatory expect-ations, this can lead to an excessive deterior-ation in real income prospects. Given all duecaution in assessing its sustainability, the fairlysubstantial revision to the oil price in mid-Julyis one illustration of the fact that simple ex-trapolations of the current trend may turnout to be inaccurate. Seen in this light, thepicture presented by current sentiment,which is undoubtedly being shaped by sucheffects as well, should not be overestimated.
Nevertheless, it should be noted that the Ifo
business climate indicator has been decliningsteadily since its all-time high in the secondquarter of 2007, with an accentuation recent-ly of the hitherto more moderate correctivemovement. In particular, business expect-ations for the next six months were rated sig-nificantly less favourably in July than, say, oneyear ago. By contrast, assessments of thebusiness situation have been declining at amore subdued pace; given the high startinglevel as well, this means that they are current-ly still in the positive range.With regard to industry, unfavourable earn-
ings expectations are likely to be one of thecauses of the deterioration in sentiment. Areduction in profit margins and increased costpressure, together with weaker sales expect-ations, have prompted a more cautious as-sessment. Nevertheless, despite the decliningvolume of new orders, the current order situ-ation is still satisfactory on the whole. Meas-ured by the order capacity index, demandexceeded the production capacity of order-based industry by 7.9% in the second quar-ter, compared with 11.8% in the previousquarter. According to the Ifo institute, thereach of the order books in July, at just overthree production months, remained at a highlevel.

In mi d-July 2008, the worl d market pri ce of (Brent) crude 
oil rea ched an all-time hi gh of U S$14 6½ per barrel. Pri ces 
subsequently showe d a marke d decline to U S$113½ (mi d-
Au gust), but were still one-sixth hi gher than at the start of 
the year an d almost three-ﬁ  fths a bove the previous year’s 
avera ge. The rise in crude oil pri ces measure d in euro – of 
one-sixth or just un der one half – was somewhat more 
subdued owin g to the euro’s appre ciation a gainst the U S 
dollar. Even so, in June (more re cent data are un availa ble)
German import pri ces for ener gy – comprisin g not only 
crude oil an d reﬁ ne d petrol eum pro ducts, but also gas, 
coal, ele ctricity an d other ener gy sour ces – were more 
than one- quarter up on their De cem ber 2007 level an d 
half as mu ch a gain a bove the previous year’s avera ge 
(see also the chart on pa ge 55).1 Even takin g into a ccount 
the forwar d quotations in the oil markets for the comin g 
months there is mu ch to in dicate that Germany’s bill for 
importe d ener gy will rise sharply this year. For the most 
part, this is likely to put pressure on the pur chasin g power 
of househol ds’ disposa ble in come.
Base d on a crude oil pri ce of aroun d US$120.00 per barrel 
of Brent crude oil an d a euro-U S dollar ex chan ge rate of 
somewhat over U S$1.50, the pri ce in crease for importe d 
ener gy amounts to rou ghly 40 % for 2008 as a whole. 
Since the volumes of importe d ener gy display a low pri ce 
elasti city in the short term, only a minor volume effe ct of 
deman d is to be expe cted. Overall therefore, Germany’s 
net ener gy costs (ie the differen ce between nominal 
ener gy imports an d exports) coul d rise in value in 2008 
by €23 billion on the year to €82¼ billion. In statisti cal 
terms, this ener gy-relate d loss of pur chasin g power 
woul d almost mat ch the s cale of the pur chasin g power 
loss due to the in creases in VAT an d insuran ce tax as of 
1 January 2007.2 In relation to nominal gross domesti c 
pro duct ( GDP) as the comprehensive domesti c in come 
varia ble, this woul d signify an in crease in ener gy-relate d 
costs of rou ghly 1 per centa ge point to 3¼ %. This ratio is 
one- quarter hi gher than the correspon ding ﬁ gure in the 
ﬁ rst oil pri ce crisis of the mi d-1970s but it is still aroun d 
one-thir d below the peak burden in the se con d crisis of 
the early 1980s. 
This means that, sin ce the re cent roun d of crude oil 
pri ce in creases began in 2002, the German e conomy’s bill for importe d ener gy has risen by 140 %. As a ratio 
of nominal gross domesti c pro duct (Y), the value of net 
ener gy imports (E) has more than dou bled to 3¼ %. In 
order to separate the stru ctural effe cts this contains from 
the pure pri ce an d ex chan ge rate effe cts, it is possi ble 
– in simpliﬁ  ed form – to make a distin ction between four 
sub-components: a pri ce component, an ex chan ge rate 
component, the import- depen dence of German ener gy 
consumption, an d aggregate ener gy intensity.
     E=Pe·  1  · e · v

In the a bove e quation, Pe denotes worl d market pri ces 
for ener gy sour ces in U S dollar (ener gy commo dities in

the euro-U S dollar ex chan ge rate. The quantity varia bles 
represent the volume of German net ener gy imports (e),
domesti c ener gy consumption (v) an d real GDP (y).
The ﬁ  rst expression, (P e / P y) is a measure of the relative 
ener gy pri ce effe ct. In the perio d from 2003 to 2008, 
worl d market pri ces for ener gy in U S dollar terms relative 
to the GDP deﬂ ator in crease d by an avera ge of 28 % per 
year. From a German perspe ctive, this was due mainly to 
a deterioration in the terms of tra de for crude oil. The 
exchan ge rate component (1/W) , whi ch correspon ds to 
the re cipro cal euro-U S dollar ex chan ge rate, ha d a damp-
enin g effe ct. Between 2003 an d 2008, the euro appre ci-
ate d against the U S dollar by 8¼ % on an annual avera ge, 
whi ch thus lessene d the in crease in worl d market pri ces 
for ener gy commo dities. The thir d term (e/v) reﬂ ects the

imports, whi ch may be approximate d by the ratio of net 
imports of primary ener gy to a ggregate primary ener gy

few months; added to this, in mid-July, theeuro started to depreciate against the US dol-lar. The latest results of the bank lendingsurvey do not indicate any restrictive lendingbehaviour by German banks either.
Even so, in terms of the future outlook, one
factor that should not be underestimated isthat it has since not been possible to maintainthe large flow of orders received at the turn of2007-08, which was characterised, not least,by an exceptional number of major new con-tracts. Demand for German industrial goodsshowed a marked decline, especially in the ex-port markets. Losses of new orders were par-ticularly pronounced in the case of enterprisesdomiciled in euro-area partner countries. By
contrast, domestic orders were trending onlymoderately downwards.
Given that the order situation in the construc-
tion sector has been without stimuli over thepast few months, the available hard econom-ic indicators are currently pointing to moresubdued economic growth in the third quar-ter. This will be due in part to the lingering ef-fects of those negative factors which, apartfrom technical counter-reactions, hamperedoutput in the second quarter. This does not,however, imply any growing downward pres-sure, although as things currently stand, acyclical “lean period” appears to be in theoffing for the second half of 2008.

57Public finances* General government budget
Last year the general government budget re-
corded a surplus (+0.1% of GDP) for the firsttime since German reunification.
1However,
the public finance situation is likely to worsensomewhat in 2008, and a slight deficit is ex-pected. Although the cyclical momentum iscurrently slowing, economic activity couldcontinue to have a positive impact on the de-velopment of public finances on an annualaverage. Structural factors are to blame forthe expected deterioration of the budgetaryposition. In particular, the sizeable tax and so-cial security rate cuts have not been matchedby the evolution of expenditure which, whilestill fairly moderate, is rising faster than inprevious years. Germany’s fiscal performanceis admittedly particularly uncertain at presentowing to the ambiguous macroeconomicoutlook and risks associated with the finan-cial market turbulence. While the govern-ment debt ratio, which amounted to 65 % in2007, should decrease markedly, the 60%ceiling stipulated by the EC Treaty will con-tinue to be overshot.
Government revenue is expected to decline
significantly in relation to GDP during thecourse of 2008. This is mainly due to changesin legislation. The business tax reform and afurther cut in the contribution rate of the Fed-

will result in substantial revenue shortfalls, onlya fraction of which will be offset by the risingcontribution rates to the statutory health andpublic long-term care insurance schemes. Inaddition, the exceptionally robust growth trendin revenue from profit-related taxes (adjustedfor legislative changes), which has been evi-dent for several years now, could reverse dur-ing the remainder of the year. This is all themore likely given the turbulence on the finan-cial markets. However, the general govern-ment revenue ratio is likely to be bolstered bythe fact that the high revenue-yielding sourceof gross wages and salaries is increasing at amore rapid pace than nominal GDP . Wage taxreceipts will be boosted in addition by tax pro-gression effects following the recent markedlyhigher wage settlements.
The government expenditure ratio will con-
tinue to fall this year. However, the declinewill be distinctly more moderate than in theprevious years and will probably be smallerthan the fall in the revenue ratio. On the onehand, decreasing unemployment meanslower expenditure, and the moderate wagegrowth of the past few years is continuing tohave a dampening effect on spending. This isdue to the fact that there is a time-lag beforemany government expenses, such as pen-sions and unemployment benefits, are adjust-ed to the wage trend. On the other hand,personnel expenditure, which made a majorcontribution to the decrease in the expend-iture ratio in previous years, is unlikely to havea dampening effect in 2008 owing to the fair-ly sizeable pay rises in the public sector.Strong expenditure growth is expected forgovernment investment and in the healthcare
sector. The effects of support measures forpublic sector banks cannot yet be gauged.
2
Overall, expenditure is expected to acceleratemuch faster than in 2007.
As things currently stand, the general govern-
ment budget in 2009 could more or less bal-ance as long as no further measures aretaken. However, the general governmentoutlook conceals the fact that central govern-ment in particular, but also other governmentareas, are likely to continue to record consid-erable structural deficits in the coming year.On the revenue side, a certain amount ofadditional income owing to the effects of taxprogression might help to counter possiblysubdued growth in receipts from profit-re-lated taxes. The revenue ratio may stayroughly at this year’s level since inter alia the
announced increases and decreases in taxand social contribution rates largely cancelout. Expenditure growth is likely to accelerateagain. Healthcare spending, in particular, isset to rise more rapidly, not least owing tonew arrangements for the remuneration ofoutpatient treatment, while labour market-related spending is not likely to decrease fur-ther. While the government debt ratio is likelyto drop further, it will probably still exceedthe reference value of 60% defined in the ECTreaty.
2If the guarantees and risk shields provided by public au-
thorities are statistically classified as government assist-
ance to prevent bank failures, government expenditure
(as defined in the national accounts) would have to be in-
creased by the difference between the original book
value and the market value of the shielded assets when
the risk shield was put into place. The Maastricht debt
level would then increase by the book value of the assets
(before depreciation).Smaller fall in

59The public finance situation in Germany has
improved noticeably in the past few years.The European requirements for the medium-term budgetary objective arising from theStability and Growth Pact and the referencevalue for government indebtedness stipulatedin the EC Treaty could well be met in the not-too-distant future. However, this prospect issubject to considerable uncertainty. This con-cerns firstly the possibility of further budget-burdening measures. Thus the impending re-calculation of the official socio-cultural min-imum subsistence level can be expected tolead to an increase in the relevant tax allow-ances (and, in all likelihood, child benefit,too). Secondly, further cuts in tax and socialsecurity rates and extra spending are currentlyunder discussion; these have not been in-cluded in the projections outlined above,which are based on legislative changes thathave already been adopted. Thirdly, a sub-stantial drop in revenue levels is likely to resultfrom 2010 onwards owing to a ruling by theFederal Constitutional Court referring to theoffsetting of health and long-term care insur-ance contributions against tax. If the bal-anced general government budgetary pos-ition that has been painstakingly achieved isnot to be frittered away, any additionalbudget-burdening measures will require solidcounterfinancing. Fourthly, the currentmacroeconomic outlook is fraught with con-siderable uncertainty. Past experience, butalso the latest developments in some othercountries, have shown just how quickly thepublic finance situation can deteriorate givenan unfavourable economic setting. Not leastthe extremely sharp growth trend in profit-re-lated taxes over the past few years harboursthe risk of a considerable setback potential,
so that the structural position might appearmuch better than it actually is.
There have been calls to launch an economic
stimulus package to be financed by additionalborrowing. However, this would cause govern-ment budgets to promptly run into difficultiesagain – even without the risks described abovematerialising. In contrast to allowing the auto-matic stabilisers to take effect, attempts bygeneral government to actively fine-tune eco-nomic policy inevitably give rise to substantialproblems. In Germany’s current situation it isespecially difficult to predict the further patternof economic development with any degree ofreliability. For example, the somewhat dulledeconomic growth at the moment can be seen,at least in part, as a return to the steady statefollowing an extremely sharp uplift in the firstquarter (see the comments on the generalcourse of economic development on pages 42-56). An economic stimulus package does notappear to be appropriate at present.

60should be noted, first, that the effect on cash
receipts of the increase in VAT at the start of2007 was still being felt in the first quarterand, second, that payments of the grant tohomeowners (that is being phased out),which are deducted from revenue mainly inMarch, decreased significantly. Revenue fromincome-related taxes
4climbed on the year by
a sizeable 81/C252%. At 71/C252%, growth in wage
tax receipts was again strong due to the risein gross wages and salaries, the decline inchild benefit payments, which are deductedfrom cash receipts, and to the tax progressioneffect. Receipts from assessed income tax ex-panded particularly strongly. In addition to ro-bust underlying dynamics, lower refunds toemployees contributed to this development.Investment income tax receipts (non-assessedtaxes on earnings and interest withholdingtax) were again up by a substantial amount.
By contrast, corporation tax revenue fellsharply, but the revenue shortfalls were moreor less at the levels that were expected as aresult of the relief arising from the businesstax reform which entered into force at thestart of 2008. No clear conclusions can bedrawn, at any rate, about the possible effectsof the financial market turbulence. Given thesubdued growth in consumption, revenuefrom consumption-related taxes
5– which
fluctuate sharply in the course of the year –grew by a total of only 1%. The increase inturnover tax receipts amounted to 2% whilethe revenue from energy and electricity taxesdecreased slightly on balance. Even revenuefrom tobacco tax declined, which is probablydue in part to the extensive ban on smokingin public places.
According to the last official tax estimate in
May, revenue growth of just under 4% (like-wise excluding local government taxes) is ex-pected for the year as a whole. The expectedslowdown vis-/C224-vis the first half of the year(+6 %) is attributable in part to the fact thatthe cited positive one-off developments oc-curred only in the first six months. Further-more, the shortfalls associated with the busi-ness tax reform appear not to have been fullyreflected in the cash receipts for corporationtax. Independently of this, a high setback po-tential exists in relation to revenue fromprofit-related taxes, which have grown extra-ordinarily strongly for some years now.

in part to larger payments to the EU, whichfluctuate greatly over the course of the year.Non-tax revenue, by contrast, rose sharply byover 31
1/C252billion, in particular as a result of
bigger asset realisations. Furthermore, the re-integration payment from the Federal Em-ployment Agency, which is intended to cover
half of the labour market integration and ad-ministrative expenses in connection with thelong-term unemployed, yielded over 3

62recorded for personnel expenditure, too, in
the wake of increases in pay rates.
For 2008 as a whole, the central government
budget envisages only a moderate decreasein the deficit of 32
1/C252billion to just over 312
billion. As things now stand, this appears tobe an achievable target. In comparison withthe draft budget, there are now a number ofadditional budgetary burdens, such as theextraordinary payment to support IKB Bank,the cancellation pursuant to a ruling by theEuropean Court of Justice of a subsidy repay-ment by the post office previously ordered bythe EU, and the higher-than-forecast increasein personnel remuneration. These burdensamounting to approximately 33 billion should
be offset, however, by lower-than-budgetedexpenditure in a similar amount, notably forinterest charges, transfers to the Federal Rail-
ways Fund, overall spending on the long-term unemployed and also for underwritingcommitments drawn. Moreover, the latesttax estimate forecasts additional revenue of3
1/C252billion.
The 2009 central government budget, ap-
proved by the Cabinet at the beginning ofJuly, envisages some consolidation progressoverall. While the deficit is to be reduced byonly31
1/C252billion – as announced in 2007 – to
just over 3101/C252billion, privatisation proceeds
are to be concurrently decreased by 361/C252bil-
lion, so that the fiscal balance should improveby38 billion after adjustment for proceeds
from asset realisations. However, a number ofitems need to be factored out of the calcula-tion: this year’s non-recurring charges total-ling over 32 billion from supporting IKB bank
and from the cancelled subsidy repaymentruling by the European Court of Justice plusone-off budgetary relief estimated at approxi-mately 32 billion owing to a retroactive meth-
odological adjustment to EU financing and achange in the way that grants to the post of-fice pension fund are appropriated, whichwill yield one-off budgetary relief amountingto3
1/C252billion.
Expenditure is expected to grow by almost
2% ( 35 billion) in 2009 vis-/C224-vis the targeted
figure for 2008. The ceiling of 1% set by theFinancial Planning Council in November 2006will therefore be perceptibly overshot onceagain even though savings of 33 billion will
result, in particular, from lower benefits forthe long-term unemployed, the end of theall-day school programme and the termin-€b n

63ation of parental benefits. The budget for
2009 indicates additional expenditure of33 billion compared to the medium-term fi-
nancial plan from last year. However, the ag-gregated increase recorded for the areas ofdefence, transportation, development aid,the environment, internal security and familyassistance is significantly higher. This add-itional expenditure classified as having polit-ical priority was partly offset in accountingterms mainly by lowering the budget appro-priation for interest payments by 31
1/C252billion.
This means that the margin of safety factoredinto this item was liquidated to help fundadditional spending programmes. Forecastexpenditure has been further lowered byshifting costs of 3
1/C252billion onto the Federal
Employment Agency following a restructur-ing of contributions for child-rearing periods,which was planned in 2007, and by changingthe payment date of VAT-financed centralgovernment grants.
Revenue has been raised in the 2009 draft
budget compared with the last financial planas tax receipts, income from the planned in-crease in motorway tolls for heavy goods ve-hicles and proceeds from the sale of CO
2cer-
tificates are expected to yield 31 billion each.
Further extra revenue has been offset by aglobal revenue cut of 31 billion as a provision
for the envisaged rise in tax allowances forchildren and in child benefit following a recal-culation of the socio-cultural minimum sub-sistence level in the fourth quarter.
The medium-term fiscal plan maintains the
target set last year of zero central govern-ment net borrowing as of 2011. However,privatisation proceeds of 34
1/C252billion are en-
visaged for 2011. In 2012, the final year ofthe medium-term financial projection, thebudget will be almost balanced after factor-ing out one-off proceeds of 31
1/C252billion. In
2010 and 2011 growth in expenditure shouldbe limited to 1
1/C252% and 1% respectively.
However, increasing rule-based transfers tothe statutory health insurance and pensioninsurance schemes are likely to restrict thisscope significantly. This means that other ex-penditure has to be kept to a minimum. Therise in special tax allowances for contributionsto the health and long-term care insuranceschemes stipulated by the Federal Constitu-tional Court as of 2010 is also likely to makeit extremely difficult to achieve the envisageddeficit reduction.

64plan. Policymakers should ensure that these
budgetary strains, as well as other tax reliefmeasures that are occasionally discussed, arefully counterfinanced so that the budget real-ly can be balanced as envisaged.
In the second phase of the reform of Germa-
ny’s federal structure, central governmentaims to tighten the borrowing limits en-shrined in Germany’s Basic Law. An outlinepaper put forward at the end of June by thechairmen of the reform commission extendsthis goal to include state government and fur-ther defines the contents of the reform.A number of the additional projects, such asan early warning system, transitory consolida-tion assistance for overindebted state govern-ments, restricted fiscal autonomy and variousadministrative reforms, are very worthwhile,and a package solution aimed at tighteningborrowing limits could increase the chancesof reaching an agreement in these areas. Yetthe introduction of an effective constitutionalsafeguard against what has hitherto beenlargely unabated growth in government debtis of particularly great importance. The ideacontained in the outline paper of pegging thisobjective to the requirements of the Stabilityand Growth Pact would prevent any incon-sistencies from arising between national andEuropean fiscal rules. Moreover, given thelooming demographic burdens it would seemsensible to greatly restrict the as yet un-defined scope for structural borrowing. Itmay also be necessary to carefully monitorthe deficits that have been classified as cyclic-ally induced. If these deficits are not offset bysurpluses during upturns, then consolidationmeasures would be necessary to prevent gov-ernment debt from permanently growing.
6If
it proves impossible to reach a satisfactoryagreement with the state governments, bor-rowing limits could be tightened for centralgovernment alone as it has been responsiblefor the largest share in the growth of govern-ment debt over the past decades.
State government budgets

The favourable development of state govern-
ment finances continued in the secondquarter, albeit a little less strongly. The surplusincreased by almost 31 billion to 36
1/C252billion
on the year. Revenue continued to growsharply (+5 %) owing to an ongoing positivetrend in tax receipts. However, expenditurelikewise rose significantly (+4 %). Besides anevidently continued large rise in transfers tolocal government under the tax revenue-sharing arrangements, this is attributable notleast to the clear increase in personnel ex-penditure (+2 %), reflecting the adjustmentof civil servants’ pay and pensions in line withthe collective pay agreements for salaried em-ployees.
However, during the remainder of the year,
notably slower tax growth and higher person-nel expenditure are likely to have a rathernegative effect and counteract any further in-

65crease in the surpluses. In fact, the budgets
foresee an aggregate deficit of 361/C252billion al-
though almost half of state governments donot intend to take up any new loans andeven intend to repay some debt. Yet in spiteof favourable growth in tax revenue, thosestates with extremely high per capita borrow-
ing, especially Bremen, Saarland and Schles-wig-Holstein, that have featured prominentlyin claims for budgetary assistance, are not ex-pecting to make any significant progress to-wards consolidation this year and in part areeven planning to borrow more than last year.Furthermore, the difficult financial situationof some Landesbanks continues to pose athreat for the states affected. However, thecharges allotted in budgets for this purposecould remain rather limited over the next fewyears as the assets that are currently greatlyimpaired are mostly to be held until maturityunder the protection of risk shields erected bythe bank owners. It is not possible at presentto estimate the losses that will then have tobe made good by state governments.

Statutory pension insurance scheme
The statutory pension insurance scheme re-
corded a surplus of almost 311/C252billion in the
second quarter of 2008. This amounts to a fi-nancial improvement of more than 3
1/C252billion
on the year. Thanks to the favourable em-ployment and pay trends, the increase in rev-enue (+2
1/C252%) outstripped that in expend-
iture (+11/C252%). Contribution receipts recorded
particularly large growth (+31/C252%), especiallyfor employees’ compulsory contributions.
However, contributions for recipients of un-employment benefits sank significantly onceagain. Transfers from the central governmentbudget showed a marginal increase on theyear. On the expenditure side, pension pay-ments went up by 1%, over half of which isattributable to the 0.54 % rise in pensions asfrom 1 July 2007 and the remainder to the –again moderate – increase in the number ofpensioners. Considerably more was spent onrehabilitation benefits.
The deficit that is customarily recorded in the
first quarter was largely offset by mid-2008.Quarterly

66In the first six months of 2007, the accumu-
lated deficit had amounted to over 311/C252bil-
lion. In the second half of 2008, a furtherboost from contribution receipts is expected.However, this will be partly offset by sharpergrowth in pension expenditure owing to thehigher increase of 1.1% as from 1 July 2008.

Overall, the financial outturn is likely to beappreciably better than last year when a sur-plus of just over 31 billion was recorded.
Federal Employment AgencyThe Federal Employment Agency recorded a
deficit of just over 3
1/C252billion in the second
quarter. Revenue went down by 101/C252%
whereas expenditure went up by 101/C252%. In a
year-on-year comparison, this constitutes a fi-nancial deterioration of 32 billion. On bal-
ance, this is almost entirely due to loweringthe contribution rate from 4.2 % to 3.3 %.The financial outturn also includes transfersof almost 31 billion to the Agency’s dedicated
civil servants’ pension fund to cover futurecivil servant pensions. Furthermore, the newreintegration payment (by means of whichthe Agency is supposed to reimburse half ofcentral government’s labour market integra-tion and administrative expenses in connec-tion with recipients of unemployment benefitII) was over 3
1/C252billion higher than the corres-
ponding compensatory amount which it hadto pay up to last year. Without these factors,the financial position of the Federal Employ-ment Agency would have improved marked-ly.
On the revenue side, income from contribu-
tions was almost 12
1/C252% lower in the secondquarter than one year ago. After adjustment
for the reduction in the contribution rate, thiswould have meant an increase of almost11
1/C252%, although such an increase would
have presented a distorted picture of theunderlying development owing to the shift ofpayments from the first to the second quar-ter. In a year-on-year comparison of the firsttwo quarters, which provides a more realisticpicture, revenue from contributions, adjustedfor the change in the contribution rate, grewby almost 5%. This reflects the favourableemployment trend and the comparativelysubstantial wage increases. In the secondquarter, the grant from central governmentwas 17
1/C252% up again on the year as, for the
first time following its introduction last year, itwas based on the assumed full effect on cashrevenue of 1 percentage point of the increasein the standard rate of VAT.
On the expenditure side, there was once
again a sharp drop in unemployment benefit I(-19 % or almost - 31 billion), which was pre-
dominantly attributable to the declining num-ber of recipients. However, this was offset, inparticular, by transfers to the dedicated civilservants’ pension fund and the higher reinte-gration payment (in the second quarter, theseamounted to + 31
1/C252billion). Higher spending
on active labour market policy measures wasof minor significance in quantitative terms.
9If the adjustment formula had been applied, this would
have resulted in a pension increase of 0.46%. However,
the 2008 Pension Adjustment Act suspended for two
years the dampening effect of deducting employees’ (pu-
tative) costs of supplementary private pension provision.
The resulting larger pension adjustments will lead to add-
itional expenditure of over 31/C252billion in the second half
of this year, 32 billion next year and 33 billion in the fol-
lowing years.Only marginal

67Measured by actual operating costs, ie ex-
cluding the one-off transfer to the civil ser-vants’ pension fund, expenditure rose by notquite 1% in the second quarter.
In the first six months of 2008, the Federal
Employment Agency recorded a deficit of al-most 33
1/C252billion. However, including the civil
servants’ pension fund, the total deficitamounted to less than 31 billion. The finan-
cial situation for the year as a whole looksmuch better than estimated in the FederalEmployment Agency’s budget. The budgeteddeficit of 35 billion (including expenditure of
32.5 billion on the one-off transfer to the civil
servants’ pension fund) will turn out to beconsiderably smaller. A surplus is likely to beposted in the second half of the year, mainlyowing to higher receipts from contributionsat the end of the year, although the longerperiod of entitlement to unemploymentbenefit I and extra vocational training costswill result in additional expenditure. In con-solidated terms, ie including the civil servants’pension fund, it is also possible that the yearas a whole will conclude with a surplus.
Ultimately, labour market developments are
the key factor for the Agency’s outlook. TheFederal Employment Agency’s finances areespecially sensitive to fluctuations in employ-ment as these have a knock-on effect bothon contribution receipts and on expenditureon wage substitutes. Any further lowering ofthe contribution rate would increase the riskthat, if the labour market dynamics were toslacken, large deficits could again be incurred
and the available reserves ( 314
1/C252billion as at
mid-2008) would be quickly depleted. As aconsequence, it may be necessary to raisecontribution rates again in an ensuing down-turn, thus magnifying its consequences.Quarterly
