Commentaries
Economic conditions
Recovery probably began in 
second quarter
German economic output is likely to have gone 
up slightly in the second quarter of 2023. Pri -
vate consumption, having previously dropped 
sharply, appears to have stabilised. This was 
partly due to the fact that the labour market 
remained in good shape, wages rose sharply 
and price inflation did not continue to acceler -
ate. The services sectors are also likely to have 
benefited from this. Furthermore, supply bottle -
necks continued to ease. Together with the 
large backlog of orders, they prevented worse 
outcomes in industry and construction. Neither 
of these sectors was able to expand their out -
put compared with the previous quarter. De -
clining foreign demand curbed industrial activ -
ity. Moreover, higher funding costs constrained 
domestic investment. They also continue to 
weigh considerably on demand for construc -
tion work. According to survey data provided 
by the ifo Institute, sentiment among busi -
nesses grew significantly gloomier in June. In -
dustry, in particular, showed a distinct increase 
in pessimism. The economic recovery over the 
remainder of the year could therefore end up 
being somewhat more tentative than expected 
in the June projection.1
Industry relying on large order 
backlog
Seasonally adjusted industrial output rose 
slightly in May compared with the previous 
month’s performance, which had been revised 
upward a little.2 Averaged over April and May, 
it was roughly at the same level as the previous 
quarter. Industry is drawing on its still full order 
books, which it can process more quickly due 
to diminishing supply bottlenecks. The latter is 
indicated by ifo Institute and S&P Global survey results. The automotive industry, in particular, 
benefited from this; according to data provided 
by the German Association of the Automotive 
Industry (VDA), which are available up to June, 
it expanded its output sharply in the second 
quarter. However, the trend decline in demand 
for industrial goods was a drag on industrial 
activity. Although industrial new orders rose 
sharply on the month in May, averaged over 
April and May they were considerably below 
the previous quarter’s level. Demand for inter -
mediate goods fell off particularly significantly. 
This is also likely to be one reason why output 
in the energy- intensive sectors, which are often 
at the front of the value chain, fell sharply, even 
though energy prices continued to decline.3 
Orders from abroad fell; this was a key factor 
behind the drop in demand. By contrast, orders 
received from Germany went back up distinctly. 
The increase in orders can be attributed, how -
ever, to individual industries in the capital 
goods sector – such as other transport equip -
ment and the electronics sector  – which are 
bucking the trend of muted domestic invest -
ment activity overall. On average across April 
and May, capital goods producers’ total do -
mestic sales were down slightly from the previ -
ous quarter after price adjustment.
Private consumption stabilised; 
service providers seeing 
growth

tion GfK improved on average for the quarter. 
Income expectations, in particular, rose signifi -
cantly. In the retail sector, price- adjusted sales 
were higher once again in May and, on aver -
age across April and May, were up markedly on 
the quarter. Households also spent consider -
ably more on travel again. By contrast, they 
probably purchased significantly fewer cars, 
with private motor vehicle registrations in the 
second quarter well below the previous quar -
ter’s level, according to data provided by the 
German Association of the Automotive Indus -
try. Service providers are likely to have bene -
fited from the uptick in consumer activity. Their 
output rose markedly in April –  the latest 
month for which data are available – compared 
with the previous quarter. According to ifo In -
stitute surveys, service providers’ business situ -
ation improved significantly in the second quar -
ter.
Labour market remains robust
The labour market has remained stable despite 
weak economic activity. However, the remark -
able increase in employment in the preceding 
months –  after eliminating seasonal fluctu -
ations – came to a halt in May. This also applies 
to employment subject to social security contri -
butions, for which data are available up to 
April. In most sectors – including manufactur -
ing – the number of positions filled stagnated. 
In particular, fewer persons held jobs subject to 
social security contributions in trade, which 
was suffering from the spending restraint, and 
temporary agency work. Only in the health and 
social services sector, where cyclical fluctu -
ations are irrelevant, was there any meaningful 
increase. According to the initial projection by 
the Federal Employment Agency, in April the 
use of short-  time work for economic reasons 
remained at the slightly elevated level of the 
previous months. However, the number of no -
tifications of short- time work is not indicative 
of any further cyclical deterioration in the la -
bour market. In June, the ifo employment bar -
ometer remained largely at the subdued level Employment did 
not rise further

elevated  levelEconomic conditions in Germany*

of the previous month and still does not herald 
any increase in employment in the months to 
come. By contrast, the relevant leading indica -
tor of the Institute for Employment Research 
(IAB) declined, though it remained in positive 
territory. The number of vacancies reported to 
the Federal Employment Agency also de -
creased, but is still quite high.
After adjustment for seasonal variations, regis -
tered unemployment rose significantly by 
28,000 persons to 2.61 million in June. The un -
employment rate went up by 0.1 percentage 
point to 5.7%. The increase affected both the 
number of unemployed persons claiming insur -
ance benefits, which predominantly reflects the 
weak economy, and the number of persons re -
ceiving the basic welfare allowance. At the 
same time, total underemployment as defined 
by the Federal Employment Agency increased 
only marginally. In addition to the unemployed, 
that figure also includes participants in labour 
market policy measures and integration 
courses. Therefore, part of the increase in regis -
tered unemployment is likely to be due to those 
measures coming to an end. For example, 
many Ukrainian refugees – who arrived in the 
previous year – are currently completing their 
language and integration courses. In the com -
ing months, both the sluggish economic recov -
ery and the completion of measures are likely 
to push unemployment up further. At all events, 
the IAB unemployment barometer indicates a 
further rise in unemployment in the coming 
months.
Energy and commodity prices 
did not fall further
After declining significantly in the first half of 
the year, energy and commodity prices did not 
fall further in recent weeks. The price effects of 
the subdued outlook for global demand and 
tighter supply broadly balanced each other out. 
Brent crude oil currently costs US$80 per barrel 
and thus even somewhat more than in May 
and June. Forward prices suggest certain dis -counts, however. That said, a supply shortage 
as a result of the decision by Saudi Arabia and 
Russia to cut their exports in July and August 
could also drive prices up further. By contrast, 
the risks to price developments from global de -
mand are likely to be tilted to the downside. 
European wholesale prices for natural gas have 
barely fallen of late and are currently at €27 per 
megawatt hour. Temporary, maintenance-  
related production losses in Norway were one 
of the factors which propped up prices.
Prices at the upstream stages of the economy 
continued to decline in seasonally adjusted 
terms in May, the latest month for which data 
are available. This is true of both imports and 
industrial goods on the domestic market. Both 
energy and non- energy imports continued to 
become cheaper. Unlike in the previous 
months, the decline in domestic producer 
prices was no longer attributable solely to en -
ergy prices. Prices of other goods also fell vis -
ibly for the first time in around three years. This 
means that import prices overall are now sig -
nificantly below their previous year’s level. In -
dustrial producer prices were barely up on the 
year.
Inflation rate increased in June 
due to base effect
In June, the Harmonised Index of Consumer 
Prices (HICP) rose by a seasonally adjusted 
0.5% on the month. The increase was thus not 
much lower than that recorded in most previ -
ous months. Although energy prices remained 
virtually unchanged and food prices increased 
less strongly, as had been the case previously, 
the prices of non- energy industrial goods and 
of services continued to display above average 
growth. Services prices even rose very sharply 
as a result of package holidays. The annual 
HICP rate rose distinctly from 6.3% to 6.8%.4

introduction of the temporary “fuel rebate” 
and “€9 ticket” in June 2022 pushed down the 
benchmark for the current general price level, 
thus raising the year- on- year rate. The rate ex -
cluding energy and food rose even more 
sharply, from 5.1% to 6.1%, as the base effect 
stemming from the introduction of the “€9 
ticket” one year earlier is even more prominent 
here. Excluding this effect, the core rate would 
be around the same as in the previous month. 
It therefore remained at an exceptionally high 
level.
The rate of inflation in Germany is likely to 
come back down in the next few months. For 
one thing, the recent decline in prices at the 
upstream stages will probably gradually be 
passed through to consumers. For another, the 
rollback of the “fuel rebate” and the “€9 ticket” 
in September 2022 will have an arithmetically 
dampening effect on the HICP rate in Septem -
ber 2023. On the other hand, core inflation (ex -
cluding energy and food) is set to remain very 
high over the summer months. Although the 
prices covered by this measure of inflation are 
currently no longer rising as sharply as before, 
a year- on- year comparison shows, however, 
that package holidays following the lifting of 
COVID-  19 restrictions once again had a much 
higher weight. This means that the usual peak 
in prices for package holidays in the summer 
will be reflected in inflation much more strongly 
this year than last year.5
Public finances6
Local government finances
Local governments (core budgets and off-  
budget entities) closed the first quarter of 2023 
with a deficit, as is usual for the time of year. At 
€7½ billion, the deficit was €2½ billion higher 
than in the same quarter of 2022. Local gov -
ernments financed €2½ billion of the deficit by 
taking on new debt, meaning that they covered 
the larger part using reserves.Revenue increased substantially on the year, by 
7% (just under +€5 billion). At 7½%, growth in 
tax receipts was similarly strong (+€1½ billion). 
After deducting shares accruing to other gov -
ernment levels, receipts from local business tax 
– a large revenue item – went up only a little 
(+1%), however. By contrast, local government 
shares in income tax rose steeply, by 73% 
(+€1½ billion). This was attributable to a small 
number of federal states, whose higher- than-  
projected revenue in the previous year still had 
to be brought to account. Transfers from state 
government also saw a robust increase (+7½%, 
or €2¼ billion), among them primarily the gen -
eral purpose grants, which, in many cases, are 
based on the federal states’ tax revenue 
growth. Receipts from fees went up by 9%. 
This is probably due largely to the fact that 
local governments have adjusted their fees in 
line with the strong cost increases caused by 
inflation.
Total expenditure grew strongly, by 10% (just 
over +€7 billion). Social spending (+14%, or 
+€2¼ billion) played a particularly significant 
role in this. It saw broad- based growth in the 
categories of accommodation costs for recipi -
ents of the basic allowance, social assistance, 
assistance for young people and benefits for 
asylum seekers. The fact that refugees from 
Ukraine have also been eligible for benefits 
since last June has had an impact on the 
growth in spending on accommodation costs. 
In addition, there was a sharp increase in other 
operating expenditure (+10%) and fixed asset 
formation (+13%). This is likely to have re -
flected, in particular, the far higher prices. 
Spending on personnel, a particularly large ex -
penditure item, rose by just under 5%. How -
ever, this was not yet impacted by the latest Inflation rates

wage settlement, which only affects the cash 
balance from the second quarter onwards.
From today’s perspective, local government is 
set to post a deficit for the year as a whole 
(2022: surplus of €2½ billion). According to the 
current tax estimate, local government tax rev -
enue is growing at a substantially slower pace 
than in previous years. Expenditure is likely to 
rise much more sharply than revenue. In add -
ition to high inflation, another burden is the 
wage settlement agreed in the spring, which 
includes remuneration adjustments that are 
high by historical standards. For example, the 
inflation compensation bonuses to be paid out 
by local governments this year are likely to 
amount to around €3 billion.
Statutory health insurance 
scheme
The statutory health insurance (SHI) scheme 
(comprising the health insurance institutions 
and the health fund) recorded a deficit in the 
first quarter of 2023, as is usual for the time of 
year. At €4 billion, it was €1½ billion higher 
than at the start of 2022. Much like a year earl -
ier, the deficit in the first quarter of 2023 was 
almost entirely attributable to the health fund. 
The main reason for this deterioration is that a 
larger deficit is planned for the health fund this 
year, involving the use of €6 billion from its re -
serves. By these means, Federal legislators wish 
to limit the increase in the average supplemen -
tary contribution rates. In addition, withdraw -
als from reserves are also planned at the level 
of the health insurance institutions: around 
€2½ billion are to be used to finance the ex -
penditure of the SHI scheme.
The revenue of the SHI scheme was down by 
7% on the same quarter of the previous year, 
as central government payments to the health 
fund decreased. For example, central govern -
ment reimbursed a substantially lower amount 
for coronavirus-  related expenditure (-€8½ bil -
lion to €1 billion) and paid out less in the form of specific funds to stabilise contributions (-€3 
billion to €½ billion). By contrast, at €1½ bil -
lion, the special grant to offset higher energy 
costs paid by central government in the first 
quarter had less of an impact.7 Contribution re -
ceipts continued to rise robustly (now by as 
much as 7%). After adjustment for the higher 
average supplementary contribution rate 
(+almost  0.2 percentage point to 1.5%), too, 
growth was strong (+6%). This was mainly due 
to increases in wages and salaries.
The expenditure of the SHI scheme fell by 5% 
compared with the start of 2022. The health 
fund spent €2½ billion on benefits relating to 
the pandemic and the energy crisis, which was 
€7 billion less than a year earlier. By contrast, 
the health insurance institutions’ expenditure 
on benefits rose fairly robustly, at 5½%. Spend -Local govern -

ing on hospital treatment, a particularly large 
expenditure item, grew by 8%.8 A major driv -
ing force behind this was the reimbursement of 
staff costs by the health insurance institutions. 
Spending on remedies and therapeutic appli -
ances increased at a similarly strong rate to 
outlays on hospital treatment. At just under 
3%, growth in expenditure on medical treat -
ments and pharmaceuticals was far weaker. It 
seems that the increased discounts resulting 
from the Act on the Financial Stabilisation of 
the Statutory Health Insurance Scheme (GKV-  
Finanzstabilisierungsgesetz)  had an impact on 
the latter. Administrative expenditure fell sig -
nificantly, by just under €½ billion, as a health insurance institution had formed large pension 
provisions a year earlier.
The SHI scheme was set to post an annual def -
icit of almost €10 billion. A total of €8½ billion 
of this amount is attributable to planned with -
drawals from reserves by the health fund and 
the health insurance institutions. In addition, 
the health fund is to finance grants to the 
health insurance institutions of €1 billion using 
borrowed funds (from a central government 
loan). However, developments to date point to 
a much better result, especially for the health 
fund. As a positive base effect, the annual out -
turn for 2022 was significantly more favourable 
than expected in the planning for 2023. This 
was mainly thanks to contribution receipts 
being higher than projected. Their favourable 
development continued in the first quarter, and 
a sharper slowdown in growth does not ap -
pear likely at present. For the health insurance 
institutions, the trend is less clear. Their annual 
outturn for 2022 was also significantly better 
than expected. However, the health insurance 
institutions raised the supplementary contribu -
tion rates by less than had been assumed by 
the Federal Ministry of Health. In addition, ex -
penditure on benefits grew somewhat more 
strongly at the beginning of the year than pro -
jected by the group of estimators.
Public long- term care

8 In the previous year, however, the health fund had paid 
out more extensive financial assistance to compensate for 
missed treatments due to the pandemic. Including these in 
the previous year and energy price subsidies in the current 
year, payments to hospitals were up by 1%.

2022, it fell by €1½ billion. Relief came mainly 
from a decline in coronavirus- related expend -
iture and a rise in central government grants. In 
addition, the transfer to the long- term provi -
dent fund was deferred, which reduced the 
deficit in the core budget by €½ billion.
Revenue saw a very steep rise of almost 11%. 
This was due not least to the higher payments 
made by central government. At present, infor -
mation is lacking on the extent to which this is 
due to advance payments for energy price sub -
sidies from the ESF- E or to an early payment of 
the regular central government grant. Contri -
bution receipts increased substantially, by 6%.
Expenditure fell slightly. In addition to the de -
ferred transfers to the long- term care provident 
fund, the sharp decline in coronavirus- related 
spending had an easing effect. Regular ex -
penditure on benefits saw continued robust 
growth of 8½%, which was significantly 
stronger than the rise in contributions. The fun -
damental financial position of the long-  term 
care insurance scheme thus deteriorated fur -
ther at the beginning of the year.
The scheme’s balance is likely to improve 
sharply for the year as a whole, with the defer -
ral of payments to the long- term care provi -
dent fund until next year playing only a minor 
role in this. A more important factor is that le -
gislators raised the contribution rate signifi -
cantly on average at mid- year (staggered by 
the number of children). This step is set to gen -
erate additional revenue of €3 billion for the 
second half of the year alone.10 The expiry of 
pandemic- related expenses will bring less relief, 
as central government had largely offset these 
burdens in the second half of 2022.
The scheme’s balance is likely to deteriorate 
again in the coming years. Key factors in this 
will be the benefit increases already approved, 
the continued transfers to fill up the long- term 
care provident fund, and demographic devel -
opments. Moreover, according to the draft 
central government budget for 2024, central government is planning to eliminate the annual 
grant of €1 billion. On the other hand, central 
government intends to reduce payments to the 
long- term care provident fund in subsequent 
years. Even if these remain unchanged, how -
ever, a surplus still appears possible initially.Deficit down at

Securities markets
Bond market
At €168.5 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in May 2023 was up significantly 
on the previous month’s figure (€127.9 billion). 
After deducting redemptions and taking ac -
count of changes in issuers’ holdings of their 
own debt securities, the outstanding volume of 
domestic bonds increased by €34.0 billion. For -
eign debt securities worth €15.7 billion net 
were placed in the German market. The out -
standing volume of debt securities in Germany 
therefore rose by €49.7 billion on balance.
Credit institutions issued bonds totalling €28.4 
billion net in May, following net redemptions of 
€1.1 billion in the previous month, with special -
ised credit institutions (including, for example, 
public promotional banks) leading the pack in 
issuing new bonds (€20.6 billion). Other bank debt securities and mortgage Pfandbriefe were 
also issued to a lesser extent (€4.9 billion and 
€2.2 billion, respectively).
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
increased their capital market debt by €3.2 bil -
lion net, following net redemptions in the same 
amount in April. On balance, issuance was al -
most exclusively attributable to other financial 
intermediaries (€2.9 billion).
The public sector increased its bond market 
liabilities by €2.4 billion net in May, following 
weak net redemptions of €0.1 billion in the 
previous month. Central government predom -
inantly issued two- year Federal Treasury notes 
(Schätze; €6.5 billion) and five- year Federal 
notes (Bobls; €4.8 billion). This contrasted with 
net redemptions of ten- year Federal securities 
(€10.3 billion) and Treasury discount paper (Bu -
bills; €6.6 billion). On balance, state and local 
governments were only marginally active in the 
capital market.
Foreign investors were the strongest group of 
buyers in May, acquiring German debt secur -
ities totalling €37.0 billion net. Domestic non-  
banks expanded their bond portfolios by €13.1 
billion net. The majority of these purchases in -
volved foreign securities. Domestic credit insti -
tutions added bonds worth €1.2 billion net to 
their holdings, all of which were foreign assets, 
on balance. Holdings of bonds in the Bundes -
bank’s portfolio decreased by €1.7 billion net. 
This was mainly because principal payments in 
May on securities purchased under the asset 
purchase programme (APP) were not fully re -
invested – as has been the case since March 
2023. At the end of June, the ECB Governing 
Council confirmed that it would not reinvest 
principal payments from the APP from July 
2023 onwards. The relevant figures will first be 
published in the press release on the German 
capital market in July 2023.High net issu -

Equity market
In the month under review, new shares worth 
€0.6 billion were issued in the German equity 
market. The outstanding volume of foreign 
shares in the German market fell by €1.4 bil -
lion. On balance, domestic non- banks were the 
sole buyers of equities in May (€3.0 billion). Do -
mestic credit institutions and foreign investors 
trimmed their share portfolios by €2.5 billion 
and €1.3 billion net, respectively.
Mutual funds
Domestic mutual funds recorded net inflows of 
€6.3 billion in May (€1.1 billion in April). On 
balance, specialised funds reserved for institu -
tional investors were the primary beneficiaries 
(€5.0 billion). Among the various asset classes, 
bond funds and mixed securities- based funds 
attracted the largest inflows (€2.9 billion and 
€1.9 billion, respectively), followed by equity 
funds (€0.9 billion) and open- end real estate 
funds (€0.6 billion). Foreign mutual funds ac -
tive in the German market recorded inflows in 
the amount of €2.0 billion. Domestic non-  
banks proved to be the main buyers (€8.1 bil -

month’s figure of €16.3 billion because receipts 
expanded by almost as much as expenditure.
Invisible current transactions saw the previous 
month’s surplus of €6.1 billion switch to a def -
icit of €7.0 billion in May. This was due to the 
shift in primary income from net receipts of 
€14.5 billion to net expenditure of €1.3 billion, 
largely as a result of higher dividend payments 
to non- residents for portfolio investment. In 
addition, the deficit in the services account 
widened by €2.3 billion to €5.7 billion mainly 
because of the typical increase in travel ex -
penditure at this time of year. The deficit in the 
secondary income account, meanwhile, nar -
rowed from €5.1 billion to just €0.1 billion. This 
was due, in particular, to the increased general 
government tax revenue from non- residents 
owing to the higher dividend payments on 
their portfolio investment.
In May, a brighter economic outlook in the 
United States and persistently high inflation 
rates shaped conditions in financial markets. 
Germany’s cross- border portfolio investment 
recorded net capital imports of €20.1 billion 
(April: net capital exports of €22.4 billion), with 
non- resident investors increased their holdings 
of German securities by €35.8 billion. They pur -
chased bonds (€23.1 billion), money market 
paper (€13.9 billion) and a small amount of 
mutual fund shares (€0.3 billion), and offloaded 
shares worth €1.4 billion. German investors 
were active abroad, too, acquiring securities 
there to the tune of €15.7 billion. On balance, 
they added bonds (€15.1 billion), mutual fund 
shares (€2.0 billion) and money market paper 
(€0.6 billion) to their portfolios, but disposed of 
shares (€2.0 billion).
In May, transactions in financial derivatives re -
sulted in outflows of €9.4 billion (April: out -
flows of €5.3 billion).Direct investment in May generated net capital 
imports of €8.6 billion (April: net capital ex -
ports of €1.4 billion). German enterprises 
lowered their foreign direct investment by €7.0 
billion, particularly reducing their intra- group 
lending (€12.4 billion). Loans declined much 
more sharply than trade credits. In addition, 
domestic enterprises provided additional equity 
capital for their foreign affiliates (€5.5 billion). 
Non- resident enterprises, meanwhile, added 
€1.6 billion to their direct investment in Ger -
many, and increased their intra- group lending 
to German affiliates by €2.6 billion. They ex -
panded their loans on balance but lowered the 
volume of trade credits granted. Moreover, 
non- resident group parents withdrew equity 
capital of €1.0 billion from domestic enter -
prises.
Other statistically recorded investment – which 
comprises loans and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank de -
posits and other investments – registered net 
capital exports on balance amounting to €29.9 
billion in May (April: net capital imports of 
€40.8 billion). Net external claims of monetary 
financial institutions excluding the Bundesbank 
declined by €3.0 billion while those of the 
Bundesbank rose by €25.5 billion; TARGET 
claims on the ECB remained virtually un -
changed. At the same time, however, deposits 
with the Bundesbank, which are held mainly by 
non- euro area residents, fell significantly. Enter -
prises and households recorded net capital ex -
ports (€9.6 billion) and general government net 
capital imports (€2.2 billion).

Digital money: 
options for the financial industry
Financial institutions and financial market infrastructures have to keep responding to new tech -
nological developments, new regulations and changing customer requirements. In recent years, 
innovations in transaction and settlement technology and new forms of money have been the 
main subject of discussion in this area. The following article explores the options available to the 
financial industry when it comes to using digital transaction technologies for payment settlement. 
The financial industry is anticipating significant efficiency gains from the interplay of distributed 
ledger technology (DLT) and the digital representation of assets it enables (referred to as tokenisa -
tion), as well as digital money. In particular, the use of a common database by all participants 
and the automated settlement of processes by means of smart contracts make DLT of interest 
with regard to its potential applications in the financial industry and in the real economy alike. 
These uses include, in particular, the automated transfer of assets (such as securities) against pay -
ment and the secure settlement of cross-  currency payments. However, in order to benefit from 
the full potential offered by DLT, it must be possible to integrate cash leg settlement into the rele -
vant processes.
With this in mind, central bank digital currency (CBDC), tokenised deposits and stablecoins are 
being considered as the primary options when it comes to financial market and large- value trans -
actions. However, it is questionable whether stablecoins will meet with broad acceptance for 
transactions in the financial sector, partly because of their governance structures and the quality 
of the collateral used to back them. Some banks are working on tokenised deposits, which take 
today’s commercial bank money a technological step further on the basis of DLT. However, a host 
of legal and practical issues concerning such deposits are still unresolved. For this reason, many 
central banks around the world have turned their attention to wholesale CBDC, which is digital 
central bank money used by a restricted user group within the financial sector to settle DLT- based 
transactions. Central bank money also logically lends itself to the settlement of large- value 
(wholesale) transactions, as it avoids the risk of default entailed by the use of commercial bank 
money. Moreover, it is the task of the central banks to promote the smooth operation of payment 
systems. Used in this context, wholesale CBDC would be a way of tokenising the cash leg of a 
transaction, facilitating direct use in DLT networks. However, this could have negative implications 
for the implementation of monetary policy or banks’ liquidity management, for example. Alterna -
tively, interoperability solutions would afford the opportunity to combine the advantages of DLT 
networks with settlement processes in existing payment systems. The benefits of digital money 
could be reaped with little risk and without an unreasonable amount of effort via interfaces with 
the settlement systems already available or by utilising trigger solutions.
In any case, close coordination and cooperation among market players, banks and central banks 
is indispensable for further developments in this area in order to prevent fragmentation and 
stand- alone solutions being developed in the future digital money ecosystem.Deutsche Bundesbank

New settlement technologies 
in the financial sector
The current discussions about digital money are 
mainly focused on CBDC being offered as a 
complement to cash. Also referred to as retail 
CBDC, this central bank money, which can be 
used by the general public in retail payments at 
the point of sale or online, for instance, is cur -
rently being explored by the Eurosystem as part 
of its digital euro project. At the same time, 
there is an increasing interest in new settle -
ment technologies, especially DLT. In the past, 
the Bundesbank has, on multiple occasions, re -
ported on the possible design of a CBDC and 
its implications for payments and securities 
settlement.1 In the meantime, various central 
banks and credit institutions have continued 
their deliberations on how, for example, to -
kenised assets2 can be settled in cash. In add -
ition, the regulatory environment has evolved 
– it has become possible to issue electronic 
securities in Germany, for example, and regula -
tion of the crypto sector is being introduced in 
the European Union.
This article focuses on the use of digital money 
in the financial sector, particularly in the area of 
large- value payments (wholesale transactions). 
The financial industry is anticipating significant 
efficiency gains from the interplay of DLT, to -
kenised assets and digital money. Furthermore, 
it is the task of the central banks to promote 
the smooth operation of payment systems. 
However, owing to substantial scale and net -
work effects, financial market infrastructures 
demonstrate a high degree of persistence, even 
when superior solutions have become avail -
able. Innovations may thus be delayed or pre -
vented as high initial investment outlays, coupled 
with the fact that advantages can often be only 
vaguely quantified, impede switchover. It is 
therefore also the task of central banks to pro -
mote the further development of the infra -
structures that they are usually responsible for 
operating or supervising. Moreover, unclear or 
unsuitable legal or regulatory frameworks may 
hinder the necessary innovations.3DLT use cases in the financial 
sector
DLT can be described as a settlement technol -
ogy for transactions of digital assets. A distrib -
uted ledger is used to collect and store transac -
tion data, allowing for the transfer of digital or 
digitally represented assets.4 The innovative na -
ture of the technology is essentially reflected by 
two characteristics. First, common decentral -
ised databases reduce reconciliation problems 
between participants that would otherwise 
have to be solved using complicated reconcili -
ation chains, sometimes with several intermedi -
aries or systems being involved. Second, the 
use of smart contracts5 enables the automated 
monitoring of contractually agreed terms and 
execution of such contracts. This could poten -
tially simplify complex business cases. Tradition -
ally, the settlement of a transaction comprises a 
sequence of steps, which also include, first, 
verifying mutual claims and liabilities (clearing), 
and, second, carrying out the actual transac -
tion (settlement), particularly where multiple 
banks are involved. Such transactions require 
an appropriate settlement infrastructure, within 
which trusted intermediaries minimise the risks 
along the process chain and allow the transac -
tion to be settled. By contrast, within a DLT 
network, clearing and settlement can take 
place on the same platform, in fully automated 
form, directly and without delay – without 
intermediaries, in other words. Smart contracts 
ensure that the transaction is only settled with 
final effect if – and only if – all contractual con -New technolo -

ditions are met. This principle of atomicity6 
guarantees security and efficiency in the settle -
ment process and minimises risks simply by vir -
tue of the technology.
From a conceptual perspective, this feature 
makes DLT attractive with regard to implemen -
tation in many areas of the financial sector. DLT 
is generally suited to use cases in which assets 
are exchanged against each other and where 
counterparty risk exists between the contract -
ual parties. It has particularly great potential for 
use in the area of financial market infrastruc -
tures, which include payment systems, secur -
ities settlement systems, trade repositories and 
securities depositories, as the basic principles of 
delivery- versus- payment and payment- versus-  
payment can be specified and carried out on 
the basis of DLT.7 Delivery- versus- payment 
means that asset transfer occurs if – and only 
if – the transfer of the corresponding payment 
has been completed. In a DLT- based infrastruc -
ture, settlement processes could virtually be 
carried out in real time (T+0), as it would be 
possible to transfer and settle tokenised assets 
in real time. In addition, the upstream and 
downstream settlement processes would ef -
fectively be integrated into the transaction pro -
cess. Overall, this would then reduce counter -
party risks and operational complexity as well 
as facilitating liquidity management. In prin -
ciple, the legal nature of the underlying assets 
is immaterial. This means that even non-  
financial assets such as real estate can be to -
kenised. In Germany, legislators have already 
laid the legal foundations for permitting the is -
suance of DLT- based securities in the form of 
the Act on Electronic Securities (Gesetz über 
elektronische Wertpapiere).  The regulatory 
framework paves the way for post- trade and 
management processes throughout the life 
cycle of DLT- based securities.
In the case of cross- border and cross- currency 
payments, the payment- against- payment prin -
ciple can be used to ensure that the final trans -
fer of a payment amount denominated in a 
certain currency takes place if – and only if – a simultaneous payment is made in the other 
currency. Applying this principle shortens inter -
mediation chains, lowers costs and speeds up 
transaction processes. It is precisely these kinds 
of payments that show particular room for im -
provement in terms of efficiency and security: 
owing to outdated systems, limited opening 
hours and long transaction chains, international 
transactions are relatively slow, expensive and 
opaque.8 In addition to the complexities in -
volved in managing liquidity in foreign curren -
cies, the lack of harmonisation and standard -
isation across different jurisdictions has so far 
proved a stumbling block for initiatives aimed 
at simplifying operations. Improving cross-  
border and cross- currency payments is a com -
plex issue that requires comprehensive solu -
tions. DLT could be part of one such solution.
One example of a purely private project con -
ducted by a payment service provider is Visa’s 
B2B Connect, which is testing a DLT- based pay -
ment system for cross- border interbank pay -
ments.9 The platform is intended to connect 
banks worldwide, thus preventing the forma -
tion of long correspondent banking chains. In 
principle, such platforms could be used not 
only to transmit payment messages, but also to 
directly integrate digital forms of money. An -
other example is Ripple. A DLT- based network 
that connects payment service providers with 
each other forms the basis of this infrastruc -
ture. Alongside recourse to bilateral credit rela -
tionships, transactions in the Ripple network 
can also be processed using the network-  
internal Ripple crypto token (XRP). Neverthe -
less, the use of XRP as a transaction medium 
entails exchange rate and counterparty risks.

the umbrella of financial market infrastructures, could be 
facilitated by the use of a single unrefuted database, too.

of XRP .10 In addition to specific use cases, indi -
vidual market participants are experimenting 
with setting up holistic DLT- based platforms 
that map out entire value chains. The viability 
of holistic platforms such as these depends on 
the private sector risk of the provider and re -
quires high initial investment. Up to now, such 
platforms based purely on DLT have not been 
able to achieve a decisive breakthrough or 
demonstrate a definite advantage. This holds 
particularly true in terms of efficiency gains, 
cost savings and operational resilience.11
Overall, the adoption of DLT in the financial 
sector is coloured by the “chicken and egg” di -
lemma, which is unlikely to be resolved without 
cooperation and exchange. Current activities 
are chiefly focused solely on conceptual as -
pects, presumably because DLT technology can 
only be used once an efficient and market-  
ready solution for cash leg settlement is avail -
able. At the same time, credit institutions and 
central banks are likely to wait for real use cases in the financial industry to emerge before 
developing appropriate payment and infra -
structure solutions. In any case, an increasing 
prevalence of DLT applications with potentially 
high trading and transaction volumes requires 
appropriate cash leg settlement. The chart 
above categorises the various forms of digital 
money that could possibly be used for this pur -
pose in the financial industry.

The Regulated Liability Network
In essence, the Regulated Liability Network 
(RLN) is an interoperable network of com-
mercial bank and central bank liabilities. 
The aim of the infrastructure is to improve 
national and international payments by 
using distributed ledger technology. The 
concept originates in the article entitled 
“The Regulated Internet of Value”, pub-
lished by Citigroup in 2021.1 Representa-
tives from various industries came together 
in 2022 to publish a white paper fl  eshing 
out the idea of the RLN.2
In the RLN, the liabilities of central banks as 
well as regulated institutions, such as com-
mercial banks and e- money institutions, are 
tokenised  and stored in a common decen-
tralised database. Using a harmonised tech-
nical platform aims to improve the effi   -
ciency of payments without jeopardising 
the two- tier banking system. With the RLN, 
central banks would be able to benefi  t from 
technological progress, but on the basis of 
a market- oriented approach.
The initiators of the RLN want to shift the 
focus of the debate on central bank digital 
currency (CBDC) to give commercial bank 
money and e- money a more prominent 
role. While discussions so far have often 
made a distinction between private and 
public forms of money, proponents of the 
RLN want to concentrate on distinguishing 
between regulated and unregulated forms 
of money. The main reasons for this change 
in tack are threefold: to avoid fragmenta-
tion in the monetary system resulting from 
the parallel development and use of CBDC, 
stablecoins and tokenised deposits; to pre-
serve the two- tier banking system; and to 
distinguish unregulated forms of money, 
such as certain crypto tokens, from the 
regulated monetary system. At the same 
time, however, CBDC should not marginal-ise the role of regulated commercial bank 
money.
The idea behind a RLN, i.e. an interplay of 
various tokenised forms of money on a 
common platform, has already been taken 
up on several occasions. The Bank for Inter-
national Settlements (BIS) describes the idea 
of a common, programmable platform on 
which tokenised forms of money circulate 
as holding “great promise”. Instead of RLN, 
the BIS uses the term “unifi  ed ledger”3,4 
and stresses the importance of governance 
of a common platform, in which the central 
bank would have to play an important role. 
In a position paper, the German Banking 
Industry  Committee advocates broadening 
the approach to the project to consider an 
ecosystem comprising retail CBDC, whole-
sale CBDC, trigger solutions and tokenised 
forms of commercial bank money.5
In November 2022, the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York announced that it would 
conduct a 12- week research study on the 
feasibility of the RLN. One aim of this proof 
of concept, in cooperation with a number 
of major US banks as well as Mastercard 
and SWIFT, was to develop and test a RLN 
prototype. The project described the RLN as 
a “theoretical fi  nancial market infrastructure 
[that] provides a multi-asset, always- on, 
programmable infrastructure containing 
digital representations of central bank, 
commercial bank, and regulated non- bank 
issuer liabilities, denominated in US dol-
lars”.6 A fi  nal report on the feasibility study 
is still outstanding.

viding central bank money and commercial 
bank money, respectively. This allocation of 
tasks helps to safeguard innovative drive in the 
private sector, amongst other things. This is re -
flected in, for example, the emergence of new 
private forms of money such as tokenised de -
posits and stablecoins, which generally enable 
cash leg settlement of DLT- based transactions. 
In principle, crypto tokens that are not deemed 
to be stablecoins could also be used for this 
purpose. However, owing to considerable fluc -
tuations in value in the past, they do not satis -
factorily perform the functions of money. Users 
also face uncertainties with regard to security 
and regulation. In this respect, it is rather un -
likely that crypto tokens will be used for large- 
value payments.
Tokenised deposits12 are an option that ties in 
closely with the existing delineation of roles in 
the current payments environment. Solutions 
developed by individual banks or groups of 
banks that could deliver efficiency gains in a 
specific set of applications are one possible in -
novation here. These could, for example, take 
the form of internal settlement systems or ap -
plications for certain customer segments. To -
kenised deposits are often perceived by the 
banking industry as taking today’s commercial 
bank money a technological step further on 
the basis of DLT. However, there are still many 
legal and practical issues to be addressed. De -
pending on the specific design of the tokens 
and the way in which they are transferred, they 
could be treated as 1) deposits, 2) e- money 
tokens within the meaning of the EU’s Markets 
in Crypto-  Assets Regulation (MiCA), or 3) trad -
able securities or another type of financial in -
strument as defined in Article 4(1) and Sec -
tion  C of Annex I to Directive 2014/ 65/ EU 
(Markets  in Financial Instruments Directive 
(MiFID   II )). Here, too, as is the case with trad -
itional payment transactions, interbank clearing 
and settlement between the banks involved in 
the transaction is still necessary – using to -
kenised central bank money, for instance, as in 
the concept embodied by the Regulated Liabil -
ity Network (see the box on p. 21). It is still un -certain whether tokenised deposits would be 
covered by deposit insurance in the event that 
the issuing bank were to fail. It would also be 
necessary to ensure that the relevant anti-  
money laundering rules were implemented and 
that terrorist financing could be prevented.
Alternatively, DLT- based money can be issued in 
the form of stablecoins. Stablecoins can differ 
widely in terms of governance and the issuer’s 
business model, as well as with regard to tech -
nical characteristics.13 Unlike tokenised de -
posits, stablecoins do not necessarily have to 
be issued by banks and still represent a claim 
on the issuer when they are transferred from 
one user to another (bearer instrument) – at 
least under MiCA.14 The respective holder’s 
right to redemption is generally accompanied 
by the proviso that the stablecoin can, at least 
in principle, be purchased by anyone, regard -
less of whether they already have an existing 
business relationship with the issuer. For this 
purpose, stablecoins are usually backed by col -
lateral.15 This is intended to keep the value of 
the token stable against its reference value – a 
single currency, for example.16 Funds received Private sector

12 In previous publications, the alternative term “tokenised 
commercial bank money” was used. The EU’s Markets in 
Crypto-  Assets Regulation (MiCA) explicitly excludes “de -
posits” within the meaning of Directive 2014/ 49/ EU from 
its definition of crypto- assets. In the absence of a 
universally- applied term, then, “tokenised deposits” is a 
more appropriate descriptor. MiCA is –  by international 
standards – a relatively comprehensive regulation govern -
ing crypto- assets, including stablecoins. The regulation 
contains, for example, requirements relating to the issu -
ance of crypto- assets. It governs the authorisation require -
ment necessary for issuers, regulates the supervision of is -
suers and contains provisions on capital adequacy and 
proper business organisation, amongst other things.
13 In the EU, MiCA restricts the issuance of stablecoins ref -
erencing a single currency (e-money  tokens) to banks and 
e- money institutions. Barely any comparable regulations 
exist outside of the EU to date.
14 See Bank for International Settlements (2023).
15 Owing to the wide range of design options, it may be 
the case that the issuer limits the use of stablecoins to a 
certain group.
16 MiCA divides stablecoins into two categories according 
to the type of reference asset to which they refer. The first, 
e- money tokens, refers to crypto- assets that maintain a 
stable value by referring to the value of an official currency. 
Meanwhile, asset- referenced tokens are, according to 
MiCA, crypto- assets that are not e- money tokens and that 
maintain a stable value by referencing another value or 
right or a combination thereof, including one or more offi -
cial currencies.Deutsche Bundesbank

by customers in exchange for stablecoins are to 
be invested in safe and liquid assets and kept 
separate from other investments.17
Banks can issue e- money tokens –  in other 
words, stablecoins, the value of which is 
pegged to a single government- issued cur -
rency – even without a reserve set up for this 
specific purpose. However, it is questionable 
whether an individual issuer’s token would be 
widely accepted and used. Alternatively, banks 
could come together to form a consortium and 
set up a special- purpose vehicle (SPV) that 
issues a token on their behalf (provided that 
this vehicle fulfils the relevant regulatory re -
quirements). However, this would pose chal -
lenges with regard to how the SPV is governed, 
for example.18 At the same time, the quality of 
collateral would play an important role, espe -
cially for use in large- value payments. Collat -
eralising the issued tokens with central bank 
money could completely eliminate counter -
party risk.19 However, this scenario presupposes 
that the central bank is willing to set up appro -
priate trust accounts for this purpose – an op -
tion that the Eurosystem currently does not 
permit.20 Under the DLT pilot regime (Regula -
tion (EU) 2022/ 858), commercial bank money 
in tokenised form and stablecoins may be used 
in DLT settlement systems, where settlement in 
central bank money is not practical and avail -
able.
Settlement in central bank 
money
Central bank money is the safest and most 
liquid form of money. Its importance is key in 
the monetary system in general and in pay -
ments in particular.21 In countries that pursue a 
stability- oriented monetary policy, central bank 
money constitutes the sole and ultimate value 
basis for all relevant forms of money. Central 
bank money in the form of cash is used primar -
ily as a means of payment and store of value in 
daily life. However, the importance of cashless 
payments in the retail segment is growing in most developed countries.22 Commercial bank 
money plays a dominant role in this context. 
This is a claim on a commercial bank, but is 
closely linked to central bank money. Commer -
cial bank money is denominated at par with 
central bank money. A depositor can withdraw 
deposits in commercial bank money from a 
bank and receive central bank money in the 
form of cash in return.
Central bank money, which is primarily held by 
credit institutions (reserves), is used to settle 
large- value payments. Banks and other finan -
cial market players that hold an account with 
the central bank can settle critically important 
large- value interbank payments or capital mar -
ket transactions in central bank money. In 
2022, the Eurosystem’s large- value payment 
system, TARGET2, processed around 400,000 
payments each business day with a total value 
of €2.2 trillion, resulting in an average transac -
tion value of €5.5 million.23 By comparison, the 
average transaction value of a payment settled 
via a retail payment system in the euro area is 
around €822.24 The use of central bank money 
reduces risks in the financial system, promotes 
financial stability, facilitates monetary policy 
and ensures trust between market participants. 
As well as being entailed by central banks’ 
statutory mandate, the general requirement for 
settlement in central bank money is defined in 
particular in the Principles for Financial Market 
Infrastructures (PFMI).25 These principles were 
drawn up by the Basel Committee on Payment

ments in central bank money where practical and available.

and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the Inter -
national Organization of Securities Commis -
sions (IOSCO). The goal of these principles is to 
improve the stability and resilience of financial 
market infrastructures.
New technological developments – such as the 
digitalisation of money we are currently wit -
nessing – and the associated changes in user 
demands, mean that settlement in central bank 
money needs to be reviewed on a permanent 
basis to check that it is fit for purpose. Central 
banks are responsible for ensuring that central 
bank money is able to retain its stabilising func -
tion and that it is not replaced to a significant 
degree by private forms of money for large-  
value payments. If new technologies such as 
DLT become market- ready and achieve market 
penetration, it must be ensured that central 
bank money can also be used for these new 
types of settlement. Central banks are caught 
in a conflict between innovation and stability. 
The legal mandate necessitates a particularly 
high degree of care with regard to the stability 
and functioning of the financial system as a 
whole. Innovations or functional advancements 
in the settlement infrastructure should there -
fore certainly not be at the expense of the sta -
bility, security and universality of central bank 
money. At the same time, they may be neces -
sary to prevent the significance of central bank 
money from being eroded – a risk posed by 
settlement structures no longer being in line 
with market requirements.
The commitment to secure, stable and efficient 
settlement infrastructures for central bank 
money is reflected in ongoing modernisation 
measures. For instance, the Eurosystem has 
launched a number of projects under the 
“Vision  2020” initiative to improve the Eurosys -
tem’s market infrastructure and further deepen 
integration of the European financial market. 
Alongside TARGET Instant Payment Settlement 
(TIPS) for the settlement of real- time retail pay -
ments and the shared Eurosystem Collateral 
Management System (ECMS) platform, one 
particular example is the TARGET2/ T2S consoli -dation project, which was implemented when 
TARGET and the new T2 large- value payment 
settlement service went live on 20 March 2023. 
This has modernised the Eurosystem’s range of 
services offered in the area of large- value pay -
ments and securities settlement and has ex -
panded it to include a central liquidity manage -
ment system. In addition, greater use of com -
mon components leverages synergies and im -
proves the automation of processes.
Expanding the existing 
payment  functionality
DLT and the real- time gross settlement (RTGS) 
systems provided by central banks that are usu -
ally used for large- value payments at the mo -
ment are not readily compatible. Today’s RTGS 
systems are based on a sequential transfer 
mechanism. Payment messages are submitted 
electronically by the participating banks and 
then processed individually. Autonomous exe -
cution of messages is limited to recurring pay -
ment instructions such as standing orders or 
liquidity transfers. This means that there is no 
straightforward way for payment messages 
that are automatically generated by DLT or smart 
contracts to be processed by RTGS systems. To 
integrate DLT- based transactions into the exist -
ing settlement infrastructure, central banks 
must make technical adaptations to those sys -
tems. The aim here is, on the one hand, to syn -
chronise the existing RTGS functionality with 
DLT- based settlement and, on the other, to 
maintain the tried- and- tested functioning, 
security and efficiency of the RTGS system.
One such synchronisation option is using trig -
ger solutions, which form a technical bridge for 
the monetary settlement between an external 
DLT network and an existing RTGS system. In -
formation from the DLT network can be trans -
lated into RTGS- compatible payment messages 
and sent to the payment system via a corres -
ponding link. The respective payment is then 
automatically initiated (triggered) and exe -
cuted. Confirmation of the successful settle -Central banks

ment of the payment is automatically sent to 
the DLT network, where the original transac -
tion is then settled with finality through the de -
livery of securities, for instance. This mechan -
ism requires an infrastructure that can operate 
between the DLT set- up and the RTGS system, 
making them compatible.26 At the same time, 
the intermediary infrastructure performs the 
function of a trustee, steering the transaction 
process and ensuring the simultaneous settle -
ment (atomicity) of the flow of goods and 
money in the two systems using the delivery-  
versus- payment principle. Technically speaking, 
the trustee function could be fully automated 
through the use of smart contract functional -
ities. But trigger solutions not only provide 
interoperability between RTGS systems and DLT 
networks – a technology- agnostic design can 
also be used to connect different DLT protocols 
and networks in order to enable settlement 
across multiple DLT networks. In practice, trig -
ger or bridge solutions have already been suc -
cessfully tested by the Bank of England in Pro -
ject Meridian, the Banca d’Italia and the 
Bundesbank.27
Besides establishing a trigger solution, existing 
interfaces could be used to connect DLT sys -
tems to the RTGS system. In this kind of model, 
the DLT system acts as an ancillary system to 
the RTGS system, which settles the cash leg of 
the payments transmitted by the ancillary sys -
tem. The central bank just provides an adapted 
communication interface for this purpose. 
Some central banks, such as the Swiss National 
Bank and the central banks of the Eurosystem, 
provide ancillary systems with access to their 
RTGS system via a corresponding interface, 
through which payment messages can be ex -
changed. As part of its RTGS Renewal Pro -
gramme, the Bank of England has conducted 
various proof- of- concept studies on how DLT-  
based settlement models could be connected 
to the system, for example by using a simple 
application programming interface (API). RTGS 
interfaces function in a similar way to trigger 
solutions, but allow only a lesser degree of 
complexity, as the smart contract functional -ities are only found within one single DLT sys -
tem connected as an ancillary system and the 
settlement options are therefore limited to this 
system. Trigger solutions, meanwhile, provide a 
multilateral interface which, from a technical 
point of view, enables the settlement of complex 
transactions across several connected systems.
The advantage of trigger solutions and RTGS 
interfaces is that they can unlock the opportun -
ities afforded by DLT- based settlement solu -
tions without the need to compromise on 
security, stability and risk profile. Central bank 
money settlement would continue to take 
place in the established systems, and access to 
central bank money would remain restricted to 
professional market participants. Minor tech -
nical adjustments would allow existing pay -
ment systems to be expanded to include pro -
grammable payments without involving a huge 
amount of technical effort. The only natural 
limitation would be in the (current) functional 
scope of the payment systems, in terms of op -
erating hours, for example. No new form of 
money would be needed, though; a suitable 
access point to the RTGS system would be the 
only requirement. At the same time, there 
would be no need to make adjustments to 
regulatory requirements, account management 
or users’ liquidity management. If access to 
central bank money remained unchanged, pos -
sible implications for the implementation of 
monetary policy and financial stability would 
likely be easy to control and manage overall.
In addition to providing a technical bridge solu -
tion, the settlement of DLT- based transactions 
could also be realised by providing wholesale 
CBDC. The term wholesale CBDC is employed 
with various meanings, but in widely used def -
initions it refers to the settlement of DLT- based 
transactions in tokenised central bank money.28

The Eurosystem’s exploratory work on wholesale CBDC
In accordance with its legal mandate, the 
Eurosystem enables the settlement of large- 
value payments (wholesale transactions) in 
central bank money using effi   cient and reli-
able settlement and payment systems. For 
this reason, the Eurosystem is continuously 
modernising its existing TARGET Services in 
order to improve settlement infrastructures.
At the same time, it is closely monitoring 
recent market developments relating to the 
use of innovative technologies in the fi  eld 
of market infrastructures and securities 
settlement, in particular initiatives to imple-
ment distributed ledger technology (DLT) in 
this area. Against this backdrop, the Euro-
system will work with fi  nancial market play-
ers to test various technical solutions allow-
ing the cash leg of fi  nancial market transac-
tions on DLT platforms to be settled in cen-
tral bank money. This exploratory work 
aims, fi  rst, to combine and develop the 
existing work of individual national central 
banks within the Eurosystem. This includes, 
in particular, the experiments on tokenised 
central bank money that the Banque de 
France has been conducting since 2020 as 
well as experiments by the Banca d’Italia 
and the Bundesbank on bridge and trigger 
solutions. Second, the Eurosystem is look-
ing into how various solutions could be 
used to allow interaction between TARGET 
Services and DLT networks and what inter-
relationships this would entail. It is also ana-
lysing potential implications, for example 
with regard to governance aspects, settle-
ment effi   ciency and banks’ liquidity man-
agement. The work is to cover both trans-
actions in test environments and transac-
tions settled in “real” central bank money in 
live operations.The aim of the exploratory phase is to gain 
insights into how support of DLT- based 
forms of settlement from a payment per-
spective might work, and the opportunities 
and risks it presents. Ultimately, the Euro-
system aims to ensure that large- value pay-
ments in the Eurosystem will continue to be 
settled in secure central bank money going 
forward to ensure the stability, integration 
and effi   ciency of the European fi  nancial sys-
tem and payments system.1 The Eurosystem 
has, with TARGET2- Securities, already made 
a signifi  cant contribution to integrating 
settlement infrastructures in the individual 
European countries; the objective is to pre-
vent this progress from being put at risk 
again by a refragmentation as a result of 
innovative developments. The exploration 
phase therefore does not anticipate a po-
tential Eurosystem policy stance, for in-
stance in favour of introducing wholesale 
CBDC. At the same time, the exploratory 
work is distinct from the digital euro pro-
ject, which deals with the potential issu-
ance of a digital form of central bank 
money to the general public for retail pay-
ments, for example in the retail sector. The 
Eurosystem’s analysis of the possible advan-
tages and disadvantages of using DLT to 
settle large- value payments is supported by 
a newly established market contact group, 
which aims to promote dialogue and the 
exchange of information between industry

a new form of central bank money. This could 
be provided by the central bank on its own DLT 
network or on one operated by a third party to 
allow market participants to settle DLT-  based 
transactions automatically by using smart con -
tracts. In the case of an independently oper -
ated DLT system, there would be two main im -
plementation options: (1) integrating tokenised 
assets into the central bank’s DLT network or 
(2) operating a pure money and central bank-  
based DLT network that interacts with market- 
operated DLT networks via a corresponding 
mechanism. The option of using wholesale 
CBDC to transfer tokenised assets in return for 
tokenised money on DLT infrastructures using 
the principle of atomicity corresponds with the 
original idea of DLT. Alongside settlement being 
available around the clock without interruption 
(24/ 7), the consistent use of DLT could result in 
efficiency gains in settlement.
Many central banks around the world are look -
ing into options for applying and implementing 
wholesale CBDC. The analysis of potential im -
plications and risks, in particular, requires a pru -
dent approach. From a central bank perspec -
tive, it is essential to ensure that appropriate 
governance rules are in place to guarantee 
continued control over central bank money. For 
issuance of tokenised central bank money on 
DLT networks operated by third parties, which 
is also theoretically possible, the central bank 
would have to be provided with ultimate con -
trol rights concerning the governance and op -
eration of the private DLT infrastructure in order 
to be able to fulfil the responsibility it has over 
central bank money. The use of public DLT net -
works by central banks is likely to be ruled out 
for this reason alone, just like the use of net -
works in which the finality of payment settle -
ment cannot be guaranteed. Even if weighing 
up the arguments made outsourcing central 
bank money to networks operated by third 
parties seem possible, reputational risks would, 
in any case, remain for the central bank if prob -
lems occurred. Furthermore, a token that rep -
resents central bank money can only be trans -
ferred to a single DLT platform and first requires liquidity to be provided from the balance on 
the central bank account (pre- funding). Tying 
up part of a balance at the central bank in 
wholesale CBDC tokens in this way could make 
liquidity management more difficult for credit 
institutions and requires further analysis given 
the implications for the implementation of 
monetary policy.
Challenges and outlook
DLT and tokenised settlement are relatively new 
market segments and it is virtually impossible 
to tell how they will develop going forward. A 
large proportion of financial industry players 
are focusing on DLT as a settlement technology 
and expect an increase in the number of po -
tential uses. However, many initiatives have not 
yet progressed further than the prototype 
stage. Given the lack of market-  readiness and 
dearth of experience, there is still a need for 
fundamental analyses relating to software 
architecture, robustness and security. At the 
same time, the legal framework for a future 
market structure would have to continue to be 
adjusted accordingly. Important factors for the 
general acceptance of the technology will 
probably be that actual problems in the market 
can be solved and that the technology offers 
specific added value in terms of cost savings, 
efficiency gains or simpler processes for busi -
nesses. DLT is therefore not likely to be the only 
method of choice – especially as centralised in -
frastructures prove to be superior for many ap -
plications.
If DLT applications are accepted and proliferate 
in the market, a growing number of solutions 
are likely to be developed to settle the cash leg 
of the respective use cases. Greater demand 
from the financial industry is likely to accelerate 
the development and use of digital money. 
New requirements call for new features that 
money should fulfil and, as a result, allow new 
forms of digital money to emerge. Generally 
speaking, when it comes to payment transac -
tions, all actors have an interest in settling them … but is 
associated  
with potentially 
greater 
implications New technolo -
gies should 
solve specific 
problems and 
not be an end in 
themselves

Global trends around wholesale CBDC
Work on central bank digital currency 
(CBDC) is stepping up around the world. In 
its 2022 survey on CBDC, the Bank for Inter-
national Settlements (BIS) identifi  ed more 
than 80 central banks engaged in CBDC- 
related endeavours. Most of these central 
banks have moved on from observation 
and have now entered phases of analysis 
and experimentation. According to the sur-
vey, three- quarters of the respondent cen-
tral banks are conducting analyses of retail 
CBDC as well as looking into wholesale 
CBDC. So far, however, more progress has 
been made on retail CBDC. Interestingly, ef-
forts regarding both retail and wholesale 
CBDC are more pronounced amongst emer-
ging market and developing economies 
than advanced economies.1
Through its network of Innovation Hub 
Centres, the BIS is playing a particular role 
in coordinating various projects involving 
wholesale CBDC, focusing predominantly 
on the cross- border settlement of payments 
and securities transactions.2 The mBridge3 
and Dunbar4 projects are two practical ex-
amples of conceptual studies on joint multi- 
currency distributed ledger technology (DLT) 
platforms. DLT- based settlement of cross- 
border and cross- currency transactions aims 
to reduce transaction costs, settlement 
times and operational complexity. To this 
end, corresponding national or regional 
platforms could also be linked together.
Singapore, which traditionally sees itself as 
the fi  nancial and technological centre of 
the ASEAN countries (Association of South-
east Asian Nations), has been undertaking 
concerted and systematic efforts towards 
utilising DLT for a number of years now. 
Through its experimental work encom-
passed by the Ubin project, the Monetary 
Authority of Singapore (MAS) has been in-
vestigating how Singapore’s economy and 
competitiveness could be strengthened by the creation of a settlement system for a 
tokenised Singapore dollar. In addition, the 
MAS is testing the possibility of using 
wholesale CBDC to enhance cross- border 
payments. Its work in this area includes, for 
example, experimental projects in collabor-
ation with the Bank of Canada (Jasper- Ubin) 
and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
(Cedar x Ubin+).5
In October 2022, the Reserve Bank of India 
launched a pilot project aimed at improving 
secondary market transactions in govern-
ment securities. The project involves testing 
the issuance, maturity and trade of digital 
government bonds as well as the cash- leg 
settlement of these bonds using wholesale 
CBDC. Future pilot projects are set to ad-
dress cross- border payments.6
In Europe, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) 
has been especially active in feasibility stud-
ies, conducting its Project Helvetia to exam-
ine near- live systems for settling tokenised 
assets in central bank money on DLT net-
works.7 As part of its “Swiss payments vi-
sion”, the SNB is investigating three differ-
ent approaches to settling token transac-
tions: synchronisation of the settlement of 
tokenised securities with the SIC payment 
system (RTGS link), issuance of a Swiss franc 
wholesale CBDC directly on a DLT network, 
and approval of a privately issued token 
backed by central bank money that would 
be protected even if the issuer were to de-
fault.8

in safe, stable and regulated forms of money. 
Against this backdrop, it is essential that mar -
ket players, credit institutions and central banks 
coordinate and collaborate with one another. 
Moreover, interoperability is likely to be crucial 
for any potential ecosystem of digital money to 
prevent stand- alone solutions being developed 
and guard against fragmentation in the pay -
ments space. With efforts being made in Eur -
ope towards greater consolidation of financial 
markets in the context of the European capital 
markets union, this is also an important aspect 
for the EU in particular. In principle, various so -
lutions regarding the application of DLT in the 
financial sector are conceivable and could co -
exist in parallel owing to the diversity of the use 
cases.
The fact that central banks are examining the 
possibilities of settling cash legs using DLT-  
based transactions in the financial industry by 
no means rules out the use of retail CBDC or 
other forms of private or digital money, such as 
e- money, tokenised deposits and stablecoins. Nevertheless, these solutions are more likely to 
be used in retail payments. Tokenised deposits 
and stablecoins could in principle also be used 
for larger value payments if they prove technic -
ally suitable. To ensure interoperability, how -
ever, innovative infrastructures are required for 
settlement in central bank money, potentially 
also in the form of wholesale CBDC. Central 
bank money would thus continue to serve as a 
monetary anchor in order to ensure the fungi -
bility of various digital forms of money. In any 
case, central bank money remains the number 
one choice for large- value payments. However, 
digital central bank money does not necessarily 
need to be provided directly on the DLT net -
work for this purpose. Technical bridge solu -
tions can facilitate interaction between digital 
networks and existing infrastructures. At the 
same time, trigger solutions represent a low-  
effort way to assess the actual need for DLT-  
based forms of settlement in the short term 
and – if necessary – to work on a long- term 
solution in parallel.Digital central 
bank money can 
serve as an 
anchor in a 
future digital 
ecosystem

Cross- border liquidity flows – the role of 
the banking system in the German balance 
of payments
Germany is a large open economy in which a great many economic transactions are conducted 
with non-  resident counterparties every day. These transactions are recorded in the balance of 
payments (b.o.p.). The bulk of them involve cross- border payment flows that are settled through 
the banking system and see liquidity being transferred from one country to another. Within the 
banking system, commercial banks and the central bank perform different, mutually supportive 
tasks. Viewed individually, transactions recorded in the b.o.p. can be traced back to specific deci -
sions by the counterparties involved and come about for all kinds of reasons. Analysed as an 
aggregate, it is possible to identify domestic and external factors and conduct a systematic inves -
tigation into the main determinants of the direction and composition of net liquidity flows.
One major source of impetus for payment flows into and out of Germany since the turn of the 
millennium has been domestic and external economic activity. Another key factor was confidence 
or uncertainty in financial markets. And monetary policy, too, has left a lasting impression on the 
German banking system’s cross-  border liquidity flows that varied largely according to whether 
monetary policy in the euro area was generally tighter or looser than in other major currency 
areas.
The past two decades have also seen a change in how commercial and central banks settle cross- 
border capital flows and in the way they interact within the banking system. Those changes were 
reflected by the extent to which cross- border payments on aggregate were transacted primarily 
in the form of commercial banks’ book money or as central bank money. The monetary policy 
measures in particular not only left their mark on the German banking system’s other investment 
as a whole, but brought about a structural change as well in the resulting liquidity flows of the 
commercial banking system and the Bundesbank.
That holds true for the current phase of monetary policy tightening as well. It would be welcome 
if this phase also saw structural excess liquidity being scaled back to a point where the private 
interbank market can regain importance in the field of European payment transactions, thus 
enabling commercial banks to focus more strongly on their traditional task once again.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
Germany’s high degree of interconnectedness 
with the global economy is reflected in a large 
number of cross- border transactions. These 
transactions come about whenever goods are 
imported or exported, with every trip abroad, 
or when non- resident securities are purchased. 
Being interconnected internationally has be -
come second nature for people living, working 
and doing business in Germany and many 
other countries. How accustomed to this situ -
ation people have become is thrown into par -
ticularly sharp relief when disruptions hit cross- 
border production and trade relations, world -
wide supply chains or global capital markets. 
The coronavirus pandemic and Russia’s war of 
aggression against Ukraine are prime examples 
of this phenomenon. The global financial crisis 
and the sovereign debt crisis that followed in 
some euro area countries affected cross- border 
relationships between many countries world -
wide in a different way altogether, yet with a 
similarly strong impact.
Crises like those mentioned above impact par -
ticularly strongly and visibly on cross- border 
economic activity. Yet even in the absence of 
extreme crisis- like episodes, there are a great 
many determinants and decisions by agents 
that drive activity. The b.o.p. systematically re -
cords all transactions between residents and 
non- residents over a specific period of time 
based on the double- entry accounting system.
The banking system – in other words, domestic 
monetary financial institutions (MFIs) including 
the central bank – provides the necessary pay -
ment services for all cross- border transactions.1 
That is, it enables the corresponding inflows 
and outflows of liquidity associated with the 
cross- border transactions. A liquidity inflow 
into Germany comes about when transactions 
posted as counterpart entries under other in -
vestment cause an increase in the euro-  
denominated deposits of residents with the 
German banking system or in the euro currency 
held by residents. In a liquidity outflow, these deposits decline or the euro currency holdings 
of residents decrease.2
This raises two questions. First, how have dif -
ferent domestic and external developments in -
fluenced Germany’s cross- border transactions 
and thus the corresponding inflow and outflow 
of liquidity? And second, how has the banking 
system ensured the payments needed for this 
over the past two decades?
The role of MFIs in a balance 
sheet context
A glance at the individual accounts within the 
b.o.p. can give an impression of the sheer 
magnitude and variety of Germany’s cross-  
border relationships.
Put simply, the current account shows transac -
tions in the real economy, the financial account 
financial ones.3 Germany’s current account last 
recorded a deficit in 2001 and has been gener -
ating surpluses – often very large ones by inter -
national standards – ever since. The current ac -
count surplus expressed relative to gross do -
mestic product (GDP) reached its highest level 
to date in 2016, at 8.6%. The year 2022 saw 
the German current account surplus contract 
significantly, dropping to €162.3 billion, or 
4.2% of nominal GDP , mainly on the back of 
rising prices for imported commodities and the 
associated deterioration in the terms of trade.How have 
domestic and 
external devel -
opments 
affected 
 Germany’s 
cross- border 
transactions 
over the past 
two decades?
How has the 
banking system 
ensured the 
necessary pay -
ments and the 
associated 
inflows and 
outflows  of 
liquidity?Germany’s 
current  account 
posted large 
surpluses …
1 In principle, residents can also hold an account with a 
non- resident bank, in which case it is possible for the pay -
ments associated with transactions to be settled outside 
the German banking system.
2 The term “liquidity” is therefore used here not in the 
sense of the different monetary aggregates, such as M0, 
M1, M2 or M3, but with regard to the structure of the 
b.o.p.
3 The current account and the financial account are the 
two most important accounts within the b.o.p. in terms of 
magnitude. Another account is the capital account, the 
balance of which has varied between a surplus of €6 billion 
and a deficit of €19 billion over the past 20 years. And then 
there is the errors and omissions item, which is derived re -
sidually as the balance of transactions not included else -
where.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
July 2023

The current account shows cross- border trans -
actions in goods and services, amongst other 
items. It is also where cross- border primary and 
secondary income is recorded. Primary income 
includes compensation of employees or invest -
ment income, for example, and secondary in -
come transfers between resident and non-  
resident households. Trade in goods and invest -
ment income stood out in recent years on ac -
count of their substantial contribution to the 
large surpluses recorded in the German current 
account.
While there were surpluses in the current ac -
count, there were correspondingly high net 
capital exports in the financial account. This 
means that claims on non- residents rose more 
strongly than liabilities to non- residents. The 
surplus in the German financial account came 
to €227.7 billion in 2022. The financial account 
is divided into five subaccounts for each type of 
external claim or liability: direct investment, 
portfolio investment, financial derivatives, re -
serve assets, and other investment. The other 
investment account shows, in particular, 
changes in loans and trade credits (other than 
those included under direct investment) as well 
as in holdings of currency and deposits with 
banks. Hence, this account records the banking 
sector’s cross- border payment services men -
tioned at the beginning of this article. In the 
b.o.p., all MFIs established in Germany belong 
to the banking sector, including the Bundes -
bank.4
MFIs play a special role on account of the pay -
ment services they provide. This role is visible in 
the b.o.p. because all transactions with non-  
residents are systematically recorded according 
to the double- entry accounting system. Each 
transaction is booked twice, no matter whether 
it is a transaction in the current account or a 
financial transaction in portfolio investment, 
say. An entry is made first for the original trans -
action (an export of goods by an enterprise, for 
example); then, a second entry – the counter -
part entry to the export of the goods – docu -
ments the payment received for the delivered goods via the enterprise’s account with a bank 
in Germany (see the box on pp.  36 f.). The 
banking system performs the payment services 
in this regard for all the remaining sectors, 
which include enterprises, households and 
government. Unlike private commercial banks, 
the Bundesbank – being a central bank with a 
statutory mandate – cannot normally be used 
directly by households and enterprises as a pro -
vider of cashless transaction services. Even so, 
their payment orders can also flow through the 
Bundesbank’s accounts and end up producing 
balances there (see the box on pp. 48 ff.). Fur -
thermore, the banking system engages in port -
folio investment with non- resident counterpar -
ties for its own account or in direct investment 
in proprietary business, for which it performs 
the necessary payment services.… and the

How individual entries are recorded in the balance of 
payments  and how balances come about in the banking 
system’s other investment account
The balance of payments records all of a 
country’s cross- border transactions in a spe-
cifi  c period and is subdivided into the current 
account, the capital account, the fi  nancial ac-
count and a net errors and omissions item. 
Put simply, the current account records trans-
actions that take place in the real economy. 
These include, for example, purchases of 
goods and services, but also investment in-
come and wage payments. If someone living 
in Germany sells a product to someone resi-
dent abroad (export) or performs a service for 
a non- resident (income, e.g. for advisory ser-
vices), this leads to an increase in the current 
account balance, all other things being equal. 
Conversely, the purchase of a good in another 
country (import) or the use of a service abroad 
(expenditure, say for accommodation abroad) 
would reduce the current account balance, all 
else being equal. For more than 20 years, Ger-
many has consistently posted current account 
surpluses, mainly because of its export surplus 
in the goods trade.
The capital account shows free transfers of 
capital as well as trade in non- produced, non- 
fi  nancial assets, which include, amongst other 
things, carbon emissions allowances. In the 
past, the balances on the German capital ac-
count have mostly been comparatively low.
Financial transactions are recorded in the 
fi  nancial account. These include direct invest-
ment, which tends to have a more long- term 
focus and involves the investor acquiring a 
signifi  cant infl  uence over management. Direct 
investment is distinct from portfolio invest-
ment. With portfolio investment, investors 
purchase foreign securities such as shares or 
debt securities, which they can usually sell 
again relatively quickly.1
The third item in the fi  nancial account is other 
investment. The term may suggest otherwise, but this balance of payments sub- account is 
actually very important. Amongst other 
things, it records all cross- border liquidity 
fl  ows. This includes all bank transfers that 
economic agents make in order to pay for an 
imported product or to purchase a foreign 
security, for example.
The balance of payments captures transac-
tions and consequently fl  ows.2 Financial ac-
count transactions always result in a resident 
acquiring or parting with a foreign asset, or a 
non- resident (e.g. a person or an enterprise 
domiciled outside Germany) acquiring or part-
ing with a German asset. Each individual 
transaction increases or reduces Germany’s 
international investment position. Germany’s 
international investment position shows hold-
ings; changes to them are, put simply, the re-
sult of balance of payments transactions.3 If 
the international investment position in-
creases, there is a net capital export, which 
has a positive sign in the fi  nancial account. By 
1 If an investor purchases a block of foreign shares, it 
is not necessarily clear whether they are pursuing a 
long- term interest and wish to exert infl  uence over the 
company’s management or whether they merely wish 
to generate an appropriate return in line with their risk 
appetite. In the balance of payments statistics, any 
equity investment where a stake of 10% or more is 
acquired is recorded in full as direct investment. 
Smaller equity holdings are considered portfolio invest-
ment.
2 The balance of payments statistics for Germany are 
compiled and published by the Bundesbank. For infor-
mation on balance of payments statistics, see https://
www.bundesbank.de/en/statistics/external-sector/
balance-of-payments/balance-of-payments-776588
3 Moreover, the international investment position may 
vary due to valuation effects such as exchange rate or 
price movements. Data on German external assets are 
available in the international investment position, a 
statistic that is compiled and published by the 
Bundesbank. Information on the international 
investment position is available at https://www.

contrast, a net capital import reduces the 
international investment position, all other 
things being equal, and is entered into the 
fi  nancial account with a negative sign.
Finally, the residual is a purely mathematical 
item that ensures that the balance of pay-
ments is always balanced. It captures the dif-
ference between the balance on the fi  nancial 
account and the balances on the current ac-
count and the capital account. It is also re-
ferred to as “net errors and omissions” and 
results from the fact that the balance of pay-
ments sub- accounts are compiled using differ-
ent primary statistics, some of which employ 
different recording principles, and that some 
data are based on estimates (such as certain 
tourism services and cash transactions).
Direct barter transactions have virtually disap-
peared from the modern economy; instead 
money is used as the means of payment. As a 
consequence, almost every transaction with 
non- residents is refl  ected not only in the 
goods account, services account or in port-
folio transactions, it is likewise recorded in the 
banking system’s other investment account.4 
At the end of a given month or year, the bal-
ance of the banking system’s other invest-
ment account represents the difference be-
tween all incoming and outgoing cross- border 
payments during the period in question.
This can be illustrated using a simple example 
involving two stylised transactions. On 5 Janu-
ary of a given year, Ms Simon, who lives in 
Germany, buys a drill for €200 from an online 
retailer, which she immediately pays for by 
transferring the money to the French seller’s 
bank account. She thereupon receives the 
product. Ten days later – on 15 January – Mr 
Bäcker, who also lives in Germany, sells his 
Federal bonds at their market value of €1,000 
to pay for a holiday on the Baltic Sea. A stu-
dent living in Switzerland purchases the bonds 
as part of her old- age provision; the transac-
tion is settled that same day. She transfers the 
money from her Swiss account to Mr Bäcker’s 
German account. If these two transactions 
were the only ones conducted with non- residents in January, Germany’s balance of 
payments for January would be as shown in 
the stylised account above.
In the example, the current account for Janu-
ary has a defi  cit of €200. The fi  nancial ac-
count has a defi  cit in the same amount. 
Within the fi  nancial account, there was also a 
shift between portfolio investment and other 
investment: in portfolio investment, external 
liabilities increased by €1,000 (as a Swiss stu-
dent purchased German Federal bonds from a 
resident of Germany). However, in other in-
vestment, incoming payments exceeded out-
going payments and resulted in a liquidity in-
fl  ow of €800, i.e. a net capital export. As a 
result, banks’ net external position in other 
investment increased. Payments are generally 
made via accounts held with commercial 
banks.

referred to as monetary fi  nancial institutions, one of 
which is the Bundesbank.Stylised balance of payments

MFIs including the Bundesbank, then, settle the 
payments associated with cross- border transac -
tions and record the corresponding inflows and 
outflows of liquidity. If, for example, goods or 
services are exported (imported), there is a 
cross- border inflow (outflow) of liquidity via the 
banking system’s accounts. A liquidity inflow is 
also generated when capital is imported, which 
happens when domestic shares or bonds are 
sold to non- residents, for example. The oppos -
ite, an outflow of liquidity, happens when resi -
dent investors purchase securities from abroad, 
say. Inflows and outflows of liquidity drive 
changes in the net external position of MFIs in -
cluding the Bundesbank in the other invest -
ment account. Viewed from a German per -
spective, these changes reflect all the cross-  
border transactions that are paid for using 
commercial banks’ book money or central bank 
money.
Developments in b.o.p. 
transactions and cross- 
border liquidity flows
Cross- border liquidity flows can be investigated 
in greater detail by presenting the b.o.p. differ -
ently.5 Viewing the b.o.p. from a different per -
spective can contribute to better understand -
ing the transmission of external and internal 
events to the German economy as well as the 
role played by the banking system in cross-  
border payments. That includes the transmis -
sion channels of European monetary policy as 
well.
The b.o.p. balances are presented in a way that 
visualises the direction of the liquidity flow as -
sociated with them (see the chart on p. 39).6 
Current account surpluses7 and net capital im -
ports (other than the banking sector’s other in -
vestment) are shown as areas stacked upwards. 
All other things being equal, these are associ -
ated with flows of liquidity into the German 
banking system – for example, resulting from 
an export surplus in goods trading, the net sale 
of German debt securities to non- residents (in -crease in external liabilities) or the cross- border 
sale of previously acquired non- resident secur -
ities (decline in external claims). By contrast, 
net capital exports (other than the banking sys -
tem’s other investment) resulting, for example, 
from a net acquisition of non- resident mutual 
fund shares (increase in external claims) or a 
repurchase of non- resident- owned Federal 
bonds (decline in external liabilities) lead to 
flows of liquidity out of the German banking 
system. These are therefore presented as areas 
stacked downwards.8 The balance of all these 
transactions is plotted as a line and corres -
ponds – depending on the sign – to the bank -
ing system’s net capital exports or imports in 
the other investment account.9
The past two decades have seen the b.o.p. bal -
ances go through different phases. Some spells 
were characterised by stronger liquidity inflows, 
others by increased liquidity outflows via the 
accounts of MFIs including the Bundesbank.
Portfolio investment, which responds particu -
larly quickly to changes in the financial environ -
ment, played a particularly important role in 
each of these swings. The balances of other 
accounts, such as the German current account 
or direct investment, were less volatile.
The global financial crisis and the sovereign 
debt crisis in some euro area countries im -
pacted significantly on the German banking 
system’s other investment, with each triggering 
swings in liquidity flows.MFIs enable

6 The balance of payments data are displayed as 12- month 
cumulated transactions, which makes it possible to smooth 
the otherwise very volatile capital flows for the reader and 
illustrate developments with greater clarity. This approach 
is quite common when presenting capital flows. See, for 
example, Deutsche Bundesbank (2020). The European Cen -
tral Bank (ECB) also uses this presentation method for its 
press releases on the euro area balance of payments.

area stacked downwards because it represents an outflow 
of liquidity.

With the onset of the financial crisis, liquidity 
inflows shrank noticeably to begin with, before 
giving way to strong liquidity outflows, leaving 
the banking system’s other investment account 
recording net capital imports. This mainly came 
about due to significant changes in portfolio 
investment – up until the onset of the global 
financial crisis, German securities had been 
highly sought after by non- residents. The global 
financial crisis then saw Germany’s cross- border 
portfolio investment flows go into reverse. 
Above all, non- resident investors invested less 
in Germany or scaled back their exposure to it, 
resulting in net capital exports in portfolio in -
vestment.
In some euro area countries, the economic cri -
sis sparked by the financial crisis gave way to a 
sovereign debt crisis, which saw capital flows 
change direction yet again. From the beginning 
of 2011, the German banking system once 
again registered net inflows of liquidity because 
German securities, especially public bonds, were in demand as safe haven assets. In the 
second half of 2012, financial markets regained 
confidence that the worst of the crisis was 
over. The German banking system’s liquidity in -
flows and outflows began to balance out again 
in the subsequent period.
The ECB Governing Council decided in January 
2015 to implement the expanded asset pur -
chase programme (APP) as a way of supporting 
inflation dynamics and responding to height -
ened risks of a too prolonged period of low 
inflation. The chief component was the pro -
gramme dedicated to purchases of bonds is -
sued by euro area central governments, agen -
cies and European institutions (public sector 
purchase programme (PSPP)).10 Being part of

chasing bonds issued by eligible German is -
suers, such as Federal bonds, in the secondary 
market as of March 2015. A very large propor -
tion of these assets were in non- resident own -
ership. As a result of the repurchase of German 
securities from non- residents (net capital ex -
ports in portfolio investment), liquidity flowed 
out of Germany, all other things being equal, 
and the banking system recorded the corres -
ponding net capital imports in the other invest -
ment account. These liquidity outflows sub -
sided for a time in 2019 after net asset pur -
chases under the APP were discontinued for a 
few months at the end of 2018.
Marked outflows of liquidity then took place 
through the banking system’s accounts be -
tween autumn 2020 and summer 2022. Unlike 
at the onset of the financial crisis, the liquidity 
outflows this time were not associated primar -
ily with net capital exports related to bonds, 
but also to shares and mutual fund shares in 
particular. Liquidity inflows via the banking sys -
tem then began to pick up again from the sum -
mer of 2022 against the backdrop of the ECB 
Governing Council’s decision to tighten monet -
ary policy.
The impact of economic 
activity  , uncertainty and 
monetary policy on German 
transactions with 
non-residents
The net liquidity inflows into and net liquidity 
outflows out of Germany via the banking sys -
tem, as described above, are the net outcome 
of the many and varied cross- border transac -
tions recorded in the b.o.p. as a whole. Be -
cause the types of transactions vary widely, 
they also end up being influenced by a great 
many factors, though certain systematic deter -
minants can nonetheless be identified. Three 
key determinants and their impact on cross-  
border transactions are investigated in greater 
detail in the following (see the box on pp. 43 ff.).One important driver of cross- border economic 
activity is economic developments – specific -
ally, how those abroad compare with those in 
Germany. If, for example, the economy is run -
ning better abroad than it is in Germany, de -
mand for German products is likely to rise. 
Goods exports abroad would increase at a 
brisker pace than goods imports, making it 
more likely that current account surpluses will 
be recorded. All other things being equal, these 
would involve liquidity inflows via the German 
banking system.
Another factor that has a bearing on cross-  
border investment decisions is sentiment in 
financial markets. Cross- border investors con -
sider not just the prospect of generating re -
turns, but also the risk inherent in their invest -
ments in their decision- making processes. 
When markets are calm, investors are generally 
more willing to tolerate higher risks because it 
means they stand to achieve a higher return. In 
times of heightened uncertainty, however, in -
vestors often seek out safe havens in order to 
hedge against abrupt asset losses.11 At the 
global level, the sheer size of the US economy 
and the special role the US dollar plays as a key 
global reserve currency make the United States 
the most important safe haven for capital in 
times of crisis.12 At the regional level, Germany, 
being the euro area’s largest Member State, 
has a similar status, especially within the mon -
etary union. Depending on where and with 
what magnitude potential disruptions play out, 
crisis episodes are therefore likely to be charac -
terised by safe haven flows into the United 
States or into Germany as well. If a global crisis 
sees demand focus mainly on US securities, 
liquidity will flow out of the German banking Significant out -
flows between 
autumn 2020 
and summer

11 Such episodes will impact on the b.o.p. over the span of 
several months. The capital flows recorded here respond 
over a longer horizon. In capital markets, by contrast, safe 
haven events are often identified on the basis of short- term 
price movements, which can build up and decline again 
within the space of days.
12 In a situation when uncertainty surges, like it did during 
the global financial crisis, responses in the opposite direc -
tion are possible as well: investors are forced to offload 
their comparatively safe investments despite the increased 
uncertainty because they need to generate liquidity.Deutsche Bundesbank

system. Where investors wishing to hold euro- 
denominated instruments are aiming first and 
foremost to shield their assets from critical de -
velopments elsewhere in the euro area, they 
focus their interest primarily on German gov -
ernment debt securities denominated in euro 
– which means that liquidity flows into the Ger -
man banking system. If the situation eases 
again later, those movements will begin to go 
into reverse.13
Monetary policy is another determinant of 
cross- border transactions. If, for instance, mon -
etary policy is tighter in the euro area than in 
other parts of the world, this will generally lead 
to changes in interest rates that give euro-  
denominated paper an edge over securities de -
nominated in different currencies.14 The likely 
outcome of this is brisker demand for debt 
securities from Germany and other euro area 
countries. In that kind of situation, the German 
banking system would generally see inflows of 
liquidity from (non- euro) non- residents, and 
hence, all other things being equal, an increase 
in its net external claims. Monetary policy can 
impact on cross- border transactions through 
other channels as well, like via their effects on 
the exchange rate, asset prices or cross- border 
lending.15
The three factors mentioned above – economic 
activity, uncertainty and monetary policy – set 
important framework conditions for agents op -
erating internationally. In terms of their effect 
on cross- border transactions, it is always im -
portant to look at how these factors develop 
within Germany compared with outside Ger -
many. But what systematic impact have 
changes in these determinants had on transac -
tions in the German b.o.p. over the past two 
decades? And how did they ultimately affect 
the cross- border liquidity flows of the German 
banking system? These questions are systemat -
ically explored using Bundesbank estimations 
based on a Bayesian vector autoregressive 
(BVAR) model.The analysis examines how exogenous changes 
in the aforementioned factors – economic ac -
tivity, uncertainty and monetary policy  – af -
fected the cross- border net liquidity flows of 
the German banking system. The BVAR model 
allows us to quantify what shares of the fluctu -
ations in liquidity flows can be attributed to 
these three stimuli.
The BVAR model estimations underscore how 
important the impact of economic activity in 
Germany relative to other countries is for Ger -
many’s cross- border transactions. The historical 
decomposition indicates that foreign demand 
for German goods and services still tended to 
support German banks’ net claims and send 
liquidity flows their way at the start of the 
global financial crisis. During the sovereign 
debt crisis in some euro area countries, how -
ever, economic activity went into steep decline, 
especially in the key European partner coun -
tries. During this period, economic activity thus 
also contributed to the considerable liquidity 
outflows from the German banking system.
Starting in February 2022, Russia’s war of ag -
gression against Ukraine placed a considerable 
strain on economic activity in Germany. At the 
same time, Germany’s terms of trade deterior -
ated significantly owing to surging commodity 
prices. Together, these two factors led to a 
drastic reduction in Germany’s current account 
surplus and thus – taken in isolation – to cor -
responding lower liquidity inflows.
Changes in uncertainty likewise explain a large 
share of the variation in liquidity flows. In the 
model, the “safety” motive for investment is 
characterised by international investors’ willing -
ness to accept yield discounts when buying 
assets. In the early 2000s, German bonds, es -Monetary

pecially, benefited from their status as com -
paratively safe assets. This changed during the 
course of 2008, when the financial crisis which 
had originally been confined to the United 
States spread to other countries and hit the ad -
vanced economies in particular. The global na -
ture of these distortions increasingly steered 
global capital flows into the United States, 
which was still regarded as a particularly safe 
haven, even though the crisis had originated 
there. The German banking system’s net claims 
in the other investment account subsequently 
declined and, ultimately, liquidity outflows in 
fact predominated.
At the height of the sovereign debt crisis in 
some euro area countries (2011 to mid- 2012), 
another influx of safe haven flows into the Ger -
man banking system was observed, mainly 
from other euro area countries. These receded 
as confidence in the cohesion of European 
monetary union grew again in the second half 
of 2012.
The outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in 
early 2020 posed a new global challenge for 
the world economy. The pandemic not only led 
to a historic slump in economic activity, but 
also sent uncertainty about future economic 
developments skyrocketing. Once again, the 
United States emerged as the key haven for 
international capital flows in times of crisis. In 
Germany, this was initially accompanied by 
stress- induced liquidity outflows. As financial 
market tensions subsequently eased, this effect 
was reversed and Germany saw net capital im -
ports in portfolio investment. Conversely, these 
led to higher net capital exports in other invest -
ment in the German banking sector.16
The Russian war of aggression launched against 
Ukraine in February 2022 marks a particular 
turning point in Germany’s external relations 
and likewise sparked a rapid rise in uncertainty. 
This led to increased demand for US securities 
around the world. These safe haven flows can 
be identified in the model, as was the case dur -
ing the global financial crisis and at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, by risk- induced out -
flows of liquidity from the German banking sys -
tem.
Monetary policy in the euro area and other 
parts of the world had strongly varying effects 
on transactions in the German b.o.p. over the 
period under analysis. At the beginning of 
monetary union and also during the global 
financial crisis up until the sovereign debt crisis 
in some euro area countries in 2010, the model 
classifies the monetary policy of the Eurosystem 
as fairly restrictive compared with monetary 
policy in other countries. From the start of 
2010 to early 2011, the model then identifies a 
significantly expansionary impulse in the Euro -
system’s monetary policy compared with that 
of other countries, combined with large net 
outflows of liquidity from Germany.
After that, up to the end of 2020, European 
monetary policy had sometimes contractionary 
and sometimes expansionary effects on the 
cross- border liquidity flows of the German 
banking system. The Eurosystem’s asset pur -
chase programmes played an important role in 
euro area monetary policy from the end of 
2014 to mid- 2022. However, given that the 
major world economies had similar monetary 
policy measures in place during this period, in 
the model they displayed no pronounced mon -
etary policy impact on the net capital exports 
of the German banking system in other invest -
ment overall in many years.17 That said, they 
most likely had a significant impact within the 
banking system, which can be seen in the 
cross- border transactions of commercial banks 
on the one hand and of the Bundesbank on 
the other (see the box on pp. 48 ff.).

The determinants of cross- border liquidity fl  ows through 
the banking system
This box takes a closer look at the cross- 
border transactions of the monetary fi  nan-
cial institutions established in Germany, in-
cluding the Bundesbank, recorded as other 
investment in the balance of payments 
(b.o.p.). The changes in their net external 
claims in the other investment account re-
fl  ect all cross- border transactions that are 
paid for using commercial banks’ book 
money or central bank money. They corres-
pond to the cross- border liquidity fl  ows of 
the banking system. Within the b.o.p., the 
German banking system’s liquidity fl  ows in 
the other investment account are counter-
part entries to the transactions made by en-
terprises, households and government, but 
also to the transactions made by the bank-
ing system for its own account in portfolio 
investment and direct investment.1 The 
banking system is responsible for the asso-
ciated payments and records the corres-
ponding infl  ows and outfl  ows of liquidity 
when, for example, goods and services are 
exported or imported or capital is imported 
or exported. These relationships are regis-
tered in the b.o.p. using the double- entry 
accounting system. In net terms, changes in 
the banking system’s net claims in the other 
investment account constitute the balance 
sheet counterpart entries to all other trans-
actions.2 Net capital exports (net capital im-
ports) in the banking system’s other invest-
ment account are accompanied by liquidity 
infl  ows (liquidity outfl  ows).
The transactions of all economic agents 
– and thus also those of the banking sys-
tem – are infl  uenced by factors such as eco-
nomic activity, uncertainty in fi  nancial mar-
kets, and monetary policy. In terms of cross- 
border transactions, it is always important 
to look at how these factors develop within 
Germany compared with abroad. A model 
is used to estimate the impact of domestic and external economic developments, un-
certainty in global fi  nancial markets, and 
monetary policy in major currency areas on 
German cross- border payments over the 
past two decades.
Model specifi  cation, data and 
identifying  shocks3
The impact of the above- mentioned deter-
minants on changes in the banking system’s 
net claims in the other investment account 
is estimated using a Bayesian vector autore-
gressive (BVAR) model. All data are incorp-
orated as month- on- month changes for 
n = 4 variables:
1. The net claims of the banking system in 
the other investment account, as they 
appear in the b.o.p. statistics (bank_oth, 
in € billion).
2. The yield spread between international 
and German government bonds (yield_
spread_wd, in percentage points).4
3. The non- dimensional index of business 
confi  dence provided by the OECD as a 
measure of cyclical factors.5 The variable 
1 Transaction- related changes in reserve assets and the 
residual net errors and omissions item likewise belong 
to these counterpart entries.
2 At the euro area level, these relationships are re-
fl  ected in the monetary presentation of the b.o.p. See 
Picón Aguilar et al. (2020) and Duc et al. (2008).
3 Econometricians generally refer to shocks rather 
than impulses. In contrast to the main article, the tech-
nical specifi  cations presented in this box therefore use 
the term “shock”.
4 Yields are derived from the corresponding Bloom-
berg indices for global and German government bonds 
across all maturities (Bloomberg Global Aggregate 
– Government EUR and Bloomberg Euro Aggregate: 
Germany – Government EUR). Since the index values 
refl  ect the price developments of the underlying secur-
ities, the BVAR model uses logarithms of the original 
values with the sign reversed.

All variables are adjusted for their long- term 
sample mean. The estimation period runs 
from January 2001 to April 2023, with the 
inclusion of time lags shortening the effect-
ive estimation period.7 In total, 12 lags and 
thus a whole year of back data are in-
cluded.8 The estimated reduced form model 
is represented as:
yt=12X
i=1Aiyti+✏t
Here, yt = (y1,t,y2,t,…,yn,t) denotes an n × 1 
vector of the observations described above 
at time t, Ai the n × n coeffi   cient matrices 
of the observations (months) lagged by i 
units, and /uni03F5t an n × 1 vector of residuals 
that follows a multivariate normal distribu-
tion (/uni03F5t ~N (0, /summation.text)).9In the reduced form of a VAR model pre-
sented above, information about the struc-
tural relationships between the variables is 
lost. The aim of the analysis is to disclose 
how disturbances in the equilibrium, or 
shocks, affect individual variables in the sys-
tem. To this end, shocks that can be inter-
preted economically need to be identifi  ed. 
In the model presented here, these shocks

eral nominal external values, calculated from the

The euro area countries are also included in the 
weighting. The index thus takes account of the fact 
that there are no exchange rate movements vis- à- vis 
some of the partner countries that are important for 
Germany’s b.o.p. transactions. The weighting scheme 
and country group correspond to those used for the 
corresponding indicator of price competitiveness

200 to April 2023.
8 The ECB’s BEAR toolbox version 5.0 with a Minne-
sota prior is used for the estimation. The Minnesota 
prior makes assumptions for the statistical properties 
of the variables and in this way reduces the number of 
parameters to be estimated. The estimate is based on 
the recommended standard specification: auto- 
regressive coeffi   cient: 0.8; overall tightness: 0.1; cross- 
variable weighting: 0.5; lag decay: 1; total number of 
iterations: 2,000, burn- in iterations: 1,000. The time 
series of all variables are adjusted for the long- term 
sample mean, which is why estimations are made 
without a constant.

are identifi  ed using sign restrictions. The 
sign restrictions correspond to prior ideas 
from economic theory. They specify the 
qualitative impact of certain shocks on the 
individual system variables without defi  ning 
their quantitative signifi  cance. The sign re-
strictions are imposed here in such a way 
that they only have to be satisfi  ed at the 
same time for the corresponding variables 
when the economically predefi  ned shock 
occurs. Each shock has an individual prior 
pattern. Shocks can therefore be clearly dis-
tinguished from each other. They are identi-
fi  ed. What all shocks have in common is 
that they lead to an increase in the banking 
system’s net external claims. The respective 
restrictions for the individual economically 
interpretable shocks are shown in the table 
on p. 44. The assumed shocks are defi  ned 
below.
A closer look at each of the shocks
Economic activity: If the economy is run-
ning better abroad than it is in Germany, 
this tends to increase the German current 
account surplus owing to demand. All other 
things being equal, the transactions result 
in higher net external claims for banks es-
tablished in Germany. If the economy is 
running better abroad relative to Germany, 
yields abroad rise more strongly than those 
in Germany. The same is true of the busi-
ness confi  dence measured by the OECD. No 
assumptions are made regarding the ex-
change rate.
Uncertainty: If there is a stronger increase in 
uncertainty abroad than in Germany, for-
eign investors’ demand for Bunds grows.10 
If these securities were previously held by 
residents, this results in liquidity infl  ows and 
thus net capital exports in banks’ other in-
vestment. In particular, higher uncertainty 
regarding developments in other European 
countries can lead to higher demand for 
German government debt securities. Ac-
cording to theory, the assumed greater un-certainty in markets outside Germany and 
the liquidity infl  ows to Germany lead to an 
increase in the yield spread between for-
eign and German bonds. In view of the 
heightened uncertainty felt abroad, theory 
predicts that business confi  dence should 
decline relative to Germany. From a German 
perspective, the nominal effective exchange 
rate should tend to rise as a result of an un-
certainty shock. By contrast, in the event of 
global disruptions, international capital 
fl  ows – including those out of Germany – 
go mainly into the United States. In this 
case, the other model variables are also 
likely to respond in the opposite way to 
what can be expected for safe haven fl  ows 
that go primarily into Germany.
Monetary policy: A relatively contractionary 
monetary policy in the euro area, relative to 
monetary policy in countries outside the 
euro area, leads to above average interest 
rate hikes in the euro area and to stronger 
demand for debt securities from Germany 
and other euro area countries. The German 
banking system therefore sees liquidity in-
fl  ows from abroad, which, all else being 
equal, increase its net external claims. 
Viewed in isolation, tighter monetary policy 
in the Eurosystem would probably tend to 
dampen the real economic outlook. By con-
trast, the euro would be more likely to ap-
preciate.
The impulse- response functions of all vari-
ables capture the time response of the vari-
ables to the above- mentioned structural 
shocks identifi  ed by their sign. Empirical evi-
dence shows that the variables quickly re-
turn to their starting point, meaning that 
the shocks only have a short- term impact. 
This is ultimately due to the fact that

actually occur, with investors having to liquidate com-
paratively safe investments.Deutsche Bundesbank

changes in all variables are incorporated 
into the model from month to month.11
The BVAR estimation permits the time series 
of all the variables involved to be decom-
posed into the contributions made by each 
identifi  ed shock. The results of the historical 
decomposition for the change in the Ger-
man banking system’s net external claims in 
the other investment account are presented 
as 12- month cumulated transactions. The 
smoothing effect thus achieved allows for a 
clearer depiction of the otherwise very vola-
tile cross- border capital fl  ows. The chart 
above shows the signifi  cance of the differ-
ent shocks for the changes in the German 
banking system’s net claims in the other in-
vestment account, and thus for cross- 
border liquidity fl  ows, over the past two 
decades. The difference between the ex-
plained contributions (areas marked in col-
our) and the actual net liquidity fl  ows of the 
banking system (black line) is due to unex-
plained infl  uences (residuals).The results underscore how important the 
impact of economic activity in Germany 
and abroad is for Germany’s cross- border 
transactions. They also demonstrate the im-
portance of changing uncertainty in fi  nan-
cial markets for German capital fl  ows. The 
infl  uence of monetary policy during the 
period under analysis was mixed and varied 
largely according to whether monetary pol-
icy in the euro area was generally tighter or 
looser than in other major currency areas. A 
more detailed interpretation of the results 
can be found on pp. 41-47.
11 The signifi  cance of structural differences was add-
itionally tested using an alternative model. To this end, 
yield spreads and differences in business confi  dence 
were factored into the model as levels (instead of 
changes). The alternative model produced very similar 
results to the original model.Historical decomposition of the German banking system’s net liquidity flows in other

measures did not cause any liquidity outflows 
from the German banking system. On the con -
trary, the global provision of central bank 
liquidity actually tended to support the German 
banking system’s net capital exports in other 
investment, on balance, given that all major 
economies of the world had similar monetary 
policy responses.
However, the model suggests that the Eurosys -
tem’s comparatively loose monetary policy in 
2021 was a driving factor behind the liquidity 
outflows from the German banking system to 
other countries observed at that time. This re -
flects the fact that the US Federal Reserve Bank 
(Fed) initiated monetary policy tightening earl -
ier than the Eurosystem. In December 2021, 
the Governing Council of the ECB announced 
that it would reduce the pace of net asset pur -
chases under the PEPP and the APP in the fol -
lowing year, thereby paving the way for tighter 
monetary policy in the euro area as well.18 
Monetary policy-  induced outflows of liquidity 
declined and, over the course of 2022, euro 
area monetary policy had an increasingly re -
strictive effect, also compared with monetary 
policy in other countries, given the interest rate 
hikes starting in the middle of the year. This ef -
fect continued at the beginning of 2023.
Different functions of 
commercial  banks and the 
Bundesbank in cross- border 
payments
This article has so far considered the German 
banking system as a whole. This makes sense in 
view of its function as the payment service pro -
vider for the economy and allows an overall an -
alysis of the factors influencing cross- border 
liquidity flows. However, a country’s banking 
system is not a single unit, but consists – with 
the exception of a handful of countries with no 
currency of their own  – at least of a central 
bank and the other monetary financial institu -
tions, primarily commercial banks. National 
central banks have a public mandate and gen -erally do not aim to generate a profit. The 
Bundesbank is part of the Eurosystem and has 
a statutory commitment to price stability in the 
euro area. In addition, the Bundesbank per -
forms other key tasks at both the national and 
international level. Among these are, first and 
foremost, involvement in the national supervi -
sion of credit institutions, including a role in the 
EU’s Single Supervisory Mechanism, as well as 
the areas of cash management, cashless pay -
ment systems and financial stability.19 Commer -
cial banks, on the other hand, are commercial 
undertakings and serve the objectives of their 
shareholders.20
The different tasks of the Bundesbank and 
commercial banks are also reflected in the way 
in which they perform their function as pay -
ment service providers. One way that these are 
evident is in their respective contributions to 
Germany’s cross- border liquidity flows over the 
past two decades (see the box on pp. 48 ff.).
In a market economy, private transactions are 
generally conducted without the active involve -
ment of the government. The role of payment 
service provider is thus ultimately assumed by 
commercial banks – using book money.21 At 
the beginning of the 2000s, up until 2008, the 
vast majority of cross- border net liquidity flows 
in other investment were therefore also attrib -
utable to other monetary financial institutions 
excluding the Bundesbank.

20 Maximising profits does not necessarily have to be the 
prime focus. Cooperative banks or savings banks can also 
pursue other objectives, for example. However, in Germany 
they are all subject to German and EU banking regulation 
and therefore cannot completely ignore profit objectives. 
Much the same applies to promotional banks such as the 
Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau. While these are not subject 
to the Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz),  they operate in ac -
cordance with banking principles and are subject to certain 
rules set by banking supervisors.
21 Nevertheless, the bulk of the individual transactions 
within the euro area were settled via the Eurosystem’s pay -
ment system. On balance, however, the incoming and out -
going payments largely balanced out for the national cen -
tral banks involved, since the commercial banks provided 
each other with sufficient funds.Deutsche Bundesbank

The distribution of roles within the German banking system 
as refl  ected by cross- border liquidity fl  ows
A country’s banking system can be roughly 
divided into its national central bank and 
other monetary fi  nancial institutions (mainly 
commercial banks).1
The assets side of the commercial banks’ 
other investment account is affected by 
changes in the fi  nancial loans they grant to 
enterprises, households or the general gov-
ernment sector abroad, as well as changes 
in deposits they hold with fi  nancial institu-
tions abroad. The changes in their liabilities 
in other investment mainly refl  ect the in-
crease or decrease in deposits in the ac-
counts that foreign investors, including 
other fi  nancial institutions, hold with them. 
For many years, the Bundesbank’s net cap-
ital exports have been closely linked to de-
velopments in its TARGET balances with the 
ECB.2 These form the largest item out of its 
external claims under other investment and 
shape how they develop. Changes in the 
Bundesbank’s external liabilities in other in-
vestment are mainly due to the allocation 
of euro banknotes within the Eurosystem, 
and to deposits from non- euro area resi-
dents.3 The net positions of the commercial 
banks and the Bundesbank have often not 
developed independently of one another, 
especially since the outbreak of the fi  nancial 
crisis. A build- up of net claims by the 
Bundesbank was frequently accompanied 
by a corresponding reduction in the net 
claims of the German commercial banking 
system, and vice versa. The changes in 
these positions can therefore also provide 
an indication of the roles that the Bundes-
bank and the commercial banks each 
played in other investment.
Overall, developments in the banking sys-
tem’s cross- border transactions in other in-vestment over the past two decades can be 
divided into fi  ve phases. They show the im-
pact of the international fi  nancial crisis and 
the sovereign debt crisis in some euro area 
countries, as well as the impact of the Euro-
system’s non- standard monetary policy 
measures – especially its asset purchase 
programmes.
In the fi  rst phase – the years leading up to 
the start of the international fi  nancial cri-
sis – changes in the German banking sys-
tem’s net claims in other investment were 
mainly driven by the activities of commer-
cial banks. There was no systematic build- 
up of positions by the Bundesbank during 
this period. The Bundesbank’s other invest-
ment account balances were comparatively 
low. As the current account surpluses and 
frequent net capital imports in portfolio in-
vestment meant that incoming payments 
regularly outweighed outgoing payments, 
commercial banks’ accounts registered net 
capital exports in most years. The counter-
parts to cross- border transactions were usu-
ally to be found in counterbalancing trans-
1 For the sake of simplicity, all monetary fi  nancial insti-
tutions excluding the Bundesbank are referred to as 
“commercial banks” in this box. While promotional 
banks with public mandates are not (profi  t- driven) 
commercial banks, they are nevertheless also part of 
the banking system.
2 TARGET balances are the aggregate balances from 
TARGET services (Trans- European Automated Real- time 
Gross Settlement Express Transfer), which form the Eu-
rosystem’s market infrastructure. This includes T2, in 
particular, which replaced the previous TARGET2 sys-
tem on 20 March 2023. The use of TARGET services by 
commercial banks to settle cross- border transactions 
may result in claims on, or liabilities towards, the ECB. 
If the resulting claims and liabilities between central 
banks do not balance out over the course of a day, 
they are netted out at the end of the business day to 
form a single (net) claim on, or liability towards, the 
ECB. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2017b).

actions in the private interbank market.4 
Commercial banks provided each other 
with suffi   cient liquidity in the form of book 
money in the interbank market, irrespective 
of the country in which they were based. As 
a result, the Bundesbank’s TARGET transac-
tions largely balanced each other out at this 
time.
The outbreak of the global fi  nancial crisis, 
which originated from the sub- prime mort-
gage crisis in the United States, marks the 
start of the second phase. The international 
fi  nancial crisis, starting in the summer of 
2007 and spreading around the world from 
the autumn of 2008, impeded the function-
ing of the market for cross- border lending 
between commercial banks as they became 
increasingly mistrustful of one other given 
concerns that partner banks might face 
payment diffi   culties. Creditor banks called 
in maturing loans and several debtor banks 
were no longer able to obtain suffi   cient 
funding in the private market.
The Governing Council of the ECB re-
sponded by adopting a number of non- 
standard monetary policy measures,5 thus 
ensuring that commercial banks continued 
to receive suffi   cient liquidity. As consumer prices came under pressure, the ECB Gov-
erning Council also made monetary policy 
more expansionary through interest rate 
cuts.
In the second half of 2007, the Bundes-
bank’s TARGET claims rose signifi  cantly. 
However, its net external claims declined 
again the very next year. In connection with 
the fact that commercial banks continued 
to register net capital exports, this shows 
that German banks weathered the global 
fi  nancial crisis relatively well overall and 
continued to play a major role in inter-
national payments.
From the spring of 2010 onwards, the sov-
ereign debt crisis in some euro area coun-
tries shaped events in the fi  nancial markets. 
It caused prices to fall sharply in the bond 
4 Here, the interbank market also includes transactions 
between institutions within a group.
5 These included longer- term refi  nancing operations 
with a maturity of up to six months (see European 
Central Bank (2008a)), as well as the transition to the 
full allotment of central bank liquidity via fi  xed- rate 
tenders (see European Central Bank (2008b)). In add-
ition, the Eurosystem expanded the collateral frame-
work for monetary policy operations (see European 
Central Bank (2008c)), and also secured the supply of 
foreign currency through swap lines with major central 
banks outside the euro area (see European Central 
Bank (2008d)).The banking system's other investment

markets of highly indebted partner coun-
tries, which also put the banking systems in 
question under severe pressure owing to 
large price losses and liquidity outfl  ows. As 
a result, the ECB Governing Council decided 
to adopt another set of non- standard meas-
ures to compensate for the limited func-
tioning of the interbank market.6 The funds 
provided by the central banks were utilised 
asymmetrically by the commercial banks of 
the Member States. Some of the liquidity 
allocated was used to settle cross- border 
payment obligations. This was accompan-
ied by a further rise in TARGET balances in 
the euro area, particularly that of the 
Bundesbank.7 All in all, the events therefore 
also had a visible impact on other invest-
ment.
The Bundesbank’s net external claims in 
other investment rose signifi  cantly up to 
mid- 2012. This was mainly due to TARGET 
claims, which had climbed to almost €730 
billion by the end of June 2012. By contrast, 
the net external claims of commercial banks 
established in Germany fell perceptibly. For 
the fi  rst time, a clear pattern of the mirror- 
image developments in the positions of the 
Bundesbank and the commercial banks in 
the other investment account could now be 
observed. This mirror- image pattern is an 
expression of the changing roles of the 
Bundesbank and the commercial banks dur-
ing the crisis.8 During this phase, the Ger-
man banking system as a whole initially re-
corded marked net capital imports in other 
investment up to the autumn of 2010. After 
this, mainly owing to developments in the 
Bundesbank’s position, there was a sharp 
rise in net capital exports, coupled with sig-
nifi  cant liquidity infl  ows.
On balance, both net liquidity infl  ows via 
the Bundesbank’s accounts and net liquidity 
outfl  ows via the German commercial banks’ 
accounts continued until the summer of 2012. This development subsequently tailed 
off, and even reversed from 2013 onwards 
(phase 3). The reason for this was easing 
tensions in the fi  nancial markets, which 
helped encourage banks to lend to each 
other again.9 This was refl  ected in Germa-
ny’s other investment in the form of declin-
ing net capital exports in the banking sys-
tem. The Bundesbank’s TARGET claims de-
clined markedly during this phase. By con-
trast, commercial banks’ net external claims 
rose again.
The asset purchase programme (APP) saw 
the Eurosystem central banks (including the 
ECB) enter the market starting in October 
2014 as purchasers of securities issued in 
the euro area. From March 2015, euro area 
central banks purchased large volumes of 
public sector securities in the secondary 
market, mainly under the public sector pur-
chase programme (PSPP), with each na-
tional central bank buying bonds from its 
own jurisdiction.10 This marks the start of 
the fourth phase, bringing with it a fresh 
increase in national TARGET balances. This 
time, however, the increase was not related 
to growing unease in the international 
fi  nancial markets. Instead, it was due to the 
APP and Europe’s fi  nancial architecture, 
6 These included purchases of Greek government 
bonds under the Securities Markets Programme (SMP) 
and a new set of longer- term refi  nancing operations.

8 Commercial banks based in Germany reduced their 
claims on commercial banks abroad. The foreign com-
mercial banking systems obtained the liquidity required 
for cross- border credit transfers through tender oper-
ations with their respective national central banks. 
Within the euro area, these credit transfers were pro-
cessed via TARGET.
9 This was connected to a speech by Mario Draghi, 
President of the ECB at the time, in which he stated 
that the ECB was ready to do “whatever it takes” to 
preserve the euro; see European Central Bank (2012a). 
In addition, the Eurosystem adopted a programme of 
outright monetary transactions (OMT); see European 
Central Bank (2012b, 2012c). To date, the OMT pro-
gramme has not been used.

with Frankfurt as a major European fi  nan-
cial hub.11 This can be seen clearly in the 
German banking system’s other investment. 
When the PSPP was launched in March 
2015, the mirror- image balances of the 
commercial banks and the Bundesbank in 
the other investment account reversed 
again. The Bundesbank’s accounts now re-
corded net liquidity infl  ows, while the ac-
counts of the commercial banks registered 
liquidity outfl  ows. In terms of the balance 
of the banking system as a whole, these 
positions largely offset each other in most 
years.
The Eurosystem central banks did not make 
any net purchases under the APP from the 
end of 2018 up to and including October 
2019. There were no mirror- image develop-
ments in the balances of the Bundesbank 
and the commercial banks during this 
period, either. Net capital exports in port-
folio investment were signifi  cantly lower 
owing to the lack of net purchases by the 
Bundesbank, and the banking system’s net 
capital exports in other investment rose per-
ceptibly during this period. These mainly 
took place via the commercial banks’ ac-
counts, while the Bundesbank’s TARGET 
claims declined during this time.
Around the turn of 2019-20, the Euro-
system resumed net purchases under the 
APP . In March 2020, the pandemic emer-
gency purchase programme (PEPP) was 
additionally adopted to address the risks to 
the monetary policy transmission mechan-
ism posed by the rapid spread of the 
coronavirus (phase 5). The Bundesbank’s 
TARGET balances subsequently rose again, 
as they had during net purchases under the 
APP , with the Bundesbank’s TARGET claims 
reaching a temporary peak of €1,269 billion 
at the end of 2022.Overall, however, the cross- border transac-
tions of non- banks (including banks’ propri-
etary business in direct investment and 
portfolio investment) led to signifi  cant 
liquidity outfl  ows out of the German bank-
ing system from the autumn of 2020 to the 
summer of 2022. For example, foreign in-
vestors’ deposits on accounts with com-
mercial banks increased markedly. The Bun-
desbank’s holdings of foreign deposits, 
mainly from non- euro area residents, also 
rose. Data cumulated over 12 months 
therefore also showed liquidity outfl  ows via 
the Bundesbank’s accounts, despite rising 
TARGET claims in some cases.12
The fi  fth phase ended in July 2022, when 
net asset purchases under the APP were 
discontinued, thus bringing net purchases 
as a whole to an end.13 In addition, the ECB 
Governing Council raised key interest rates 
by a total of 400 basis points in several 
steps up to June 2023.14 In the second half 
of 2022, transactions in the German bal-
ance of payments were again increasingly 
accompanied by liquidity infl  ows via the 
banking system’s accounts. In the fi  rst six 
months of 2023, the Bundesbank’s TARGET 
balance fell markedly.

ities from the allocation of euro banknotes within the

part entry for the new special drawing rights allocated 
by the IMF. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2022b).

This changed fundamentally with the onset of 
the global financial crisis, as commercial banks 
were no longer willing to lend money to one 
another – a key prerequisite for cross- border 
transactions in the interbank market – on ac -
count of the high level of uncertainty overall 
and, in particular, the perceived high level of 
counterparty credit risk.22 The Eurosystem inter -
vened in the situation and provided commercial 
banks with central bank liquidity, mainly 
through longer- term refinancing operations. As 
a result, credit institutions increasingly bor -
rowed the necessary funds from the domestic 
central bank. Cross- border provision of funds 
was now taking place within the Eurosystem 
through the transfer of central bank money. In 
addition, a newly established network of swap 
lines with the Fed and other central banks 
secured the provision of foreign currency and 
thus also ensured payments could be made 
with non- euro area partners.23
Expansionary monetary policy can, however, 
also influence the distribution of roles within 
the banking system even when there is no ser -
ious disruption in the interbank market. This is 
evident in the cross- border liquidity effects of 
the Eurosystem’s asset purchases. When the 
APP was launched, the Bundesbank’s net exter -
nal position in the other investment account 
started to grow in early 2015. This was because 
of an increase in its TARGET claims24 on the 
ECB, which reflected persistent inflows of cen -
tral bank liquidity via the Eurosystem. The rea -
son for these payment flows lay in the financial 
architecture of the euro area.25 If the original 
holders of the securities were resident outside 
the euro area, the purchases of the national 
central banks were largely settled through the 
subsidiaries of foreign commercial banks domi -
ciled in Germany. This meant that central bank 
liquidity from abroad flowed into the German 
banking system, while book money flowed to 
other countries via Germany’s commercial 
banking system. The two effects largely can -
celled each other out with respect to the Ger -
man banking system’s payment transactions 
with non- residents overall. This mechanism ex -plains why the APP mostly had no noticeable 
autonomous impact on other investment flows 
in the German banking system on aggregate 
between 2015 and 2018.
Cross- border payments were also very heavily 
affected by the coronavirus pandemic. From 
the end of February 2020, financial market de -
velopments were dominated by the assessment 
of the economic and financial implications of 
the pandemic. In March 2020, the Governing 
Council of the ECB announced that it would 
add a temporary envelope to the existing APP , 
which had already been resumed in November 
2019.26 It also decided to launch an additional 
purchase programme, the PEPP .27 In conjunc -
tion with the increased global risks, the expan -
sion of the purchase programmes led to mas -
sive liquidity outflows at commercial banks. 
Between autumn 2020 and summer 2022, the 
banking system as a whole also saw significant 
net capital imports in other investment.
Over the course of 2022, the Eurosystem dis -
tinctly tightened the monetary policy reins in 
view of the medium- term inflation outlook, 
which saw inflation remaining above the 2% 
target for an extended period of time. In mid- 
2022, net asset purchases under the APP were 
ended.28 In the second half of 2022, the Gov -
erning Council of the ECB raised key interest Global financial

20 March 2023. It is used, amongst other things, for the 
settlement of cross- border interbank payments in the euro 
area.

rates by a total of 250 basis points in multiple 
increments.29
Four further interest rate rises totalling 150 
basis points followed in the first half of 2023.30 
The Governing Council also gave detailed par -
ameters for reducing APP holdings. From 
March 2023, these declined at a measured 
pace, as the Eurosystem no longer reinvested 
all of the principal payments from maturing 
securities. The decline amounted to €15 billion 
per month on average until the end of June.31 
As of 1 July 2023, maturing securities in the 
APP portfolio are no longer being replaced.32 
First steps towards normalising Eurosystem 
portfolios of securities held for monetary policy 
purposes have thus been taken.
The tightening of European monetary policy 
since the middle of last year and the reduction 
of the monetary policy portfolio this year had 
an impact on the level and composition of Ger -
man liquidity flows with other countries. The 
monetary policy measures are not only leaving 
their mark on the aggregate banking system’s 
other investment account, but bringing about 
a structural change as well in the liquidity flows 
of the commercial banking system and the 
Bundesbank. If Eurosystem central banks were 
to trim their balance sheets, this is likely to re -
sult in the Bundesbank’s TARGET balances 
shrinking and its net asset position diminishing.
Conclusion and outlook
Liquidity flows into and out of Germany via the 
accounts of monetary financial institutions – in -
cluding the Bundesbank. These payment flows 
stem from cross-  border transactions in all sec -tors. The net flows can be gauged from the 
banking system’s other investment balances in 
the balance of payments. Over the past two 
decades, changes in macroeconomic condi -
tions have left a significant mark on the cross- 
border liquidity flows of the German banking 
system. This is also true of the distribution of 
roles within the banking system – that is, be -
tween commercial banks and the Bundes -
bank – for cross- border transactions in other 
investment.
In the years leading up to the financial crisis, in 
a regime of structurally scarce liquidity provi -
sion by central banks, it was overwhelmingly 
commercial banks which performed the task of 
providing cross- border funds, in the form of 
book money. Since the financial crisis and the 
sovereign debt crisis in some euro area coun -
tries, transfers of central bank money, including 
across borders, have played a greater role with 
the transition to a regime of structurally ample 
liquidity provision by central banks. The private 
interbank market became less important.
As the Eurosystem scales back its monetary 
policy portfolios in the coming years and re -
duces existing excess liquidity, it would once 
again increasingly fall to commercial banks to 
lend funds at market conditions, and allocate 
scarce resources in this way. This has always 
been one of their core tasks. A step in this di -
rection would be welcome, not least for this 
reason.… could also 
influence inter -
play between 
Bundesbank and 
commercial 
banks in other

Economic developments in emerging 
market  economies: old problems and new 
challenges
Economic growth has weakened significantly in many emerging market economies (EMEs) in 
recent years. Their economic catching- up process has stalled. Incomes in some regions, such as 
Latin America, have even fallen further behind those of the advanced economies.
The reasons for this growth slowdown in EMEs are manifold. The end of the boom in China 
played an important role, after its export- oriented growth model had increasingly begun to come 
up against limits. As a result, Chinese demand for raw materials weakened, which had a negative 
impact on commodity- exporting economies. In addition, efforts in many EMEs to improve domes -
tic growth fundamentals through structural reforms have been flagging.
EMEs are facing a number of new challenges of late. There are increasing political efforts in many 
countries to reassess international trade relations and to promote domestic production instead. 
This could have a lasting adverse impact on the globalisation process, which had opened up new 
opportunities for many EMEs. Moreover, the recent sharp, worldwide rise in interest rates is 
potentially problematic, as it poses macroeconomic risks, especially for less developed econ -
omies. Finally, EMEs are also being called upon to contribute to fighting climate change and thus 
accordingly restructure their economies over the medium and long term.
All in all, EMEs will probably have to adapt to a difficult macroeconomic environment. It would 
thus be all the more important to give fresh impetus to the economic catching- up process through 
broad- based reforms.Deutsche Bundesbank

Slowing economic growth in 
emerging market economies
Emerging market economies (EMEs)1 have been 
major drivers of the global economy, especially 
in the 2000s. Since then, however, their eco -
nomic momentum has declined markedly. 
Looking at the entire group of countries, eco -
nomic growth has fallen to an average of 4% 
per year over the past ten years (2013-2022), 
compared with 6½% in the preceding decade.2 
This slowdown has been broadly based across 
regions. Asian EMEs, which had grown particu -
larly rapidly between 2003 and 2012 at an 
average of 8½% per year, only reached a rate 
of 5¾% from that point onward. In Latin 
America, economic growth fell to just 1% per 
year. On a per capita basis, i.e. taking popula -
tion growth into account,3 real gross domestic 
product (GDP) actually stagnated there. Many 
countries in the Middle East and in Sub-  Saharan 
Africa have also recently seen only very modest 
growth in economic output per capita.By contrast, in the advanced economies, GDP 
growth remained at an average of 1¾% per 
year, as in the preceding ten-  year period. 
Owing to the reduced growth lead of EMEs, 
their progress towards convergence slowed 
considerably. Over the past ten years, the aver -
age (nominal) per capita income in EMEs has 
risen only slightly in relation to advanced econ -
omies, from 22% in 2012 to 22.6% last year.4 
The incomes of some commodity- exporting 
countries fell markedly further behind those of 
the advanced countries. This was mainly due to 
the generally rather weak price trend for raw 
materials in recent years.
Reasons for EMEs’ weaker 
growth
The end of China’s boom and 
sluggish commodities markets
In the 1990s, many EMEs, particularly in Asia 
and Eastern Europe, had initiated market re -
forms and opened up to global markets. These 
steps put them on course for integration into 
the international division of labour, which was 
a major factor driving their economic ascent. 
The establishment of multinational enterprises 
was also a factor here, as the associated trans -
fer of foreign technology and know- how sus -
tainably increased productivity in many EMEs. 
Advanced economies, in turn, gained access to 
low- cost imports and new, rapidly growing 
sales markets. The German economy also 
benefited strongly from this (see the box on 
p. 60).Significant,

look.
2 The coronavirus pandemic played only a minor role in 
moderating growth. Average growth had already fallen to 
4.5% per year in the period 2013-2019.
3 The total population in EMEs has grown by an average of 
1.2% per year over the past decade, compared with 1.3% 
in the preceding decade.
4 The conversion of per capita income is based on purchas -
ing power parity exchange rates. These take into account 
the fact that the price level in EMEs tends to be lower.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
July 2023

In the 2010s, however, China, in particular, 
reached the limits of its export- oriented growth 
model.5 One important reason was the coun -
try’s reduced cost advantage. Wage growth ac -
celerated considerably in view of the increasing 
utilisation of rural labour force potential and 
demographic changes. China had also increas -
ingly exploited its sales potential on the world 
markets for certain products. In the meantime, 
Chinese authorities tried to alleviate their 
supply- side problems through a highly expan -
sionary economic policy. This, however, led to 
considerable overinvestment in areas including 
real estate.
More recently, the Chinese government finally 
started to rebalance its economy. It first sought 
to drive the technological catching- up process 
forward. As it was beginning to reach the limits 
of existing technology, it encouraged more 
home- grown innovations. Despite high govern -
ment investment in research and development, 
however, the results have so far been mixed.6 
In addition, Chinese authorities tried to curb 
unprofitable investment and, in turn, boost 
consumption. The latter actually saw some suc -
cess – at least until the outbreak of the corona -
virus pandemic – but did not fully offset the 
slowdown in investment momentum. Overall, 
economic growth in China has continued to 
slow down in recent years.
The economic slowdown in China led to a fal -
tering of growth models in some countries 
which had previously benefited strongly from 
China’s rise. This was particularly true of 
commodity- exporting EMEs.7 China’s commod -
ities imports had grown rapidly in the 2000s. 
The country actually became the most import -
ant global buyer of certain industrial metals. 
Over the past decade, however, growth in Chi -
nese demand for commodities has flattened 
considerably. In addition, the global commod -
ity supply increased significantly due to factors 
such as the shale oil revolution in North Amer -
ica. The years-  long boom in the international 
commodity markets subsequently ended ab -
ruptly. Many commodity prices tended to barely rise or even fell in the 2010s. Without 
the tailwind provided by the boom, economic 
growth in commodity- exporting countries de -
clined sharply.8
Structural deficits and a lack of 
willingness to reform
Only a few EMEs have seen the deterioration in 
the external environment in recent years as a 
reason to improve their domestic growth bases. 
On the contrary, in many, willingness to reform 
actually seemed to ebb.China’s steep 
rise flattened

The impact of slower growth in emerging market 
economies  on the world economy and on Germany
The subdued growth in emerging market 
economies (EMEs) has put the brakes on the 
world economy in recent years. Global GDP 
growth slowed to an average of 3.1% per year 
in the period from 2013 to 2022, compared 
with 4.2% in the preceding ten- year period. 
Arithmetically, this loss of pace was attribut-
able almost entirely to EMEs.1 Nonetheless, 
their weight in the world economy continued 
to increase owing to their remaining growth 
lead. According to recent fi  gures, EMEs con-
tributed almost 60% to global economic out-
put based on purchasing power parities.2
The economic slowdown in EMEs was accom-
panied by a dampening of import demand. 
Averaged over the period from 2013 to 2022, 
their imports of goods and services increased 
by only 2.8% per year after price adjustment, 
following an annual increase of almost 10% 
previously. This sharp deceleration was the main cause of the weakness in world trade 
growth in recent times. At an average of 3.2% 
per year, advanced economies’ imports have 
even risen somewhat faster than those of 
EMEs over the past decade. At the same time, 
EMEs’ exports have also lost momentum. On 
balance, the share of EMEs in global goods 
trade, having increased substantially up to 
2012, has stagnated at around 40% based on 
market exchange rates.
The German export sector benefi  ted strongly 
from the rapid growth in EMEs in the 2000s. 
This was aided by Germany’s range of ex-
ports, with its focus on capital and transport 
goods, which fi  tted well with the import 
needs of many EMEs.3 In line with EMEs’ weak 
import dynamics in recent times, German 
goods exports to these countries then lost a 
considerable amount of steam. This signifi  -
cantly dampened Germany’s overall export 
growth.
German exports to China, too, have increased 
only moderately over the past ten years, hav-
ing previously expanded extremely sharply. 
This was due not only to weaker economic 
growth in China, but also to the reorientation 
of China’s investment and export- driven 
growth model towards private consumption 
(rebalancing). As the import content of private 
consumption is smaller than that of invest-
ment and exports, this has been accompanied 
by a dampening of China’s imports.4 In add-
ition, China has succeeded in replacing im-
ports with domestic production in certain 
product groups, e.g. in the automotive sector.
1 It should be borne in mind that global economic 
growth would even have increased markedly in recent 
years if EMEs had maintained their previous pace of 
expansion. This is due to the growing weight of EMEs 
in global GDP .
2 At market exchange rates, EMEs accounted for 43%.

Institutional frameworks such as political stabil -
ity, the rule of law and the extent of corruption 
are important determinants of long- term growth 
outlook prospects.9 Many EMEs have always 
shown marked deficits in this respect when 
compared to advanced economies. According 
to the World Bank Worldwide Governance In -
dicators,10 some major commodity exporters, 
including Brazil, Mexico and South Africa, have 
recently fallen further behind advanced econ -
omies.11 Among the other EMEs, developments 
were mixed. According to this assessment, 
China, India and Indonesia have significantly 
improved their institutional framework in re -
cent years. By contrast, Türkiye and some east -
ern European countries have dropped behind.12
In addition to institutional quality, regulatory 
frameworks are an important factor. According 
to the OECD indicators on product market 
regulation,13 said regulation was still consider -
ably more restrictive in major EMEs than in ad -
vanced economies. One important problem 
area is that of government- owned corporate 
holdings, which the OECD considers a form of 
product market regulation. In China, Indonesia 
and Russia, in particular, there are many state- 
owned enterprises, often with low productivity. 
In other countries such as Brazil and South Af -
rica, excessive bureaucracy is a major weak -
ness.
A further structural impediment to faster eco -
nomic convergence, particularly in less de -
veloped EMEs, is likely to be a lack of human 
capital. Progress has been made in the length 
and quality of schooling in most regions in re -
cent years. However, school closures during the 
coronavirus pandemic are likely to have led to 
particularly high learning losses in EMEs (see

More recent challenges 
for EMEs
Deglobalisation trends
The close integration of EMEs into the inter -
national division of labour in the 1990s and 
2000s intensified global competition. In the 
advanced economies, this triggered consider -
able adjustment processes and accelerated 
macroeconomic structural change. Many sec -
tors and regions benefited from this, but there 
were also losers. In recent years, protectionist 
tendencies have grown significantly in many 
advanced economies, reflecting an increasingly 
uneven distribution of wealth gains from glob -
alisation.
China’s dealings, in particular, have spurred 
several advanced economies into action. Many 
trading partners have accused the country of 
violating the rules of the world trade order by 
undertaking unfair trade practices such as price 
dumping or infringement of intellectual prop -
erty rights. Hopes that China would reduce its 
government influence on economic activity 
upon joining the World Trade Organization in 
2001 have been largely dashed. In addition, 
China has now become an assertive global 
power. The above factors have seen political 
tensions intensify, especially between China 
and the United States and specifically in the 
area of trade policy.14
Heightened geopolitical risks are one factor 
driving many countries’ efforts to geographic -
ally diversify their imports of commodities and 
critical intermediate input goods or to promote 
domestic production. Trade and industrial pol -
icy initiatives to this effect have already been 
put forward in the EU.15 Experience of the dis -
ruption of international supply chains during 
the pandemic and the European energy de -
pendencies exposed by the Ukraine war played 
a key role here.
Political efforts to further unravel the fabric of 
economic relationships with certain countries – also known as geoeconomic fragmentation – 
could alter the structure of the global economy 
over the coming years. At least in the case of 
strategically important goods, production and 
associated supply chains could be increasingly 
reshored domestically or in geographically 
closer or allied countries. Foreign direct invest -
ment already provides initial evidence of such 
movements.16
If the trend toward deglobalisation prevails, 
this will likely lead to considerable losses in 
global prosperity. EMEs could be among the 
biggest losers. Many of them, including China, 
have adapted their economic structure to the 
international division of labour and are strongly 
geared toward foreign trade with advanced 
economies. In a more fragmented global econ -
omy, it may become more difficult for other 
EMEs, especially those with very low per capita 
incomes, to use an export- based approach to 
rapidly catch up.17
Under such a changed framework, EMEs would 
have to make even more active efforts in future 
to exploit the benefits of international trade. 
One way to do this would be to further reduce 
trading costs. In EMEs, the cost of cross- border 
trade in goods remains, on average, more than 
one- and- a- half times that in advanced econ -
omies.18 This cost disadvantage is attributable 
not only to higher transport and logistics costs 
but also to less favourable trade policy frame -
work conditions on the part of the EMEs. In -
centives to reduce trade policy barriers could 
also be provided by regional free trade agree -
ments.19 A number of EMEs have stepped up 
their participation in these in recent years.Increasing

The role of human capital in emerging market economies’ 
catching- up process
There is a considerable global disparity be-
tween individual nations’ per capita in-
comes. In 2022, the GDP per capita in pur-
chasing power parities (PPP) of the ten 
poorest countries in the world was not 
even US$1,800. India and China, the two 
most populous countries on the planet, had 
fi  gures of around US$8,300 and US$21,400, 
respectively, whereas per capita income in 
Germany stood at US$63,800. There are 
many different factors driving these dispar-
ities, including fi  xed capital supply and the 
availability of technology, but human cap-
ital also plays a role. The term human cap-
ital covers the abilities and skills of the 
population needed for employment and 
thus the quality of the workforce.
Human capital is created through upbring-
ing, primary, secondary and tertiary educa-
tion, vocational training, and professional 
development.1 The average number of 
years of schooling is a very simple metric for 
measuring a country’s human capital. The 
World Bank’s Learning Adjusted Years of 
Schooling (LAYS) index also incorporates 
learning outcomes.2 Whereas in emerging 
market economies (EMEs) the pure number 
of years of schooling is often only slightly 
lower than in advanced economies, the gap 
is far greater when applying the World 
Bank’s quality- adjusted indicator.3 That 
holds particularly true for African countries.There is a rather close correlation between 
a country’s human capital as measured by 
the World Bank indicator and its per capita 
GDP . A higher level of education among the 
population is generally associated with 
higher incomes. However, this is not yet 
proof of causality, as higher incomes in turn 
also enable higher investment in education. 
Widespread “brain drain” is likely to be a 
factor behind the extremely low per capita 
incomes of some African countries. In add-
ition, in many of the region’s countries, 
considerable segments of the workforce are 
tied up in agriculture, often leaving them 
unable to make full use of their acquired 
human capital. Therefore, human capital 
gains often lead to signifi  cant increases in 
prosperity only if workers migrate to more 
productive sectors.
1 In addition, a certain survival rate and suffi   cient 
healthcare are fundamental preconditions to the accu-
mulation of human capital.
2 The indicator weights the number of years of school 
completed by relative performance on harmonised 
tests. See World Bank (2018).

In addition, initial levels of education and 
subsequent per capita GDP growth are 
positively correlated. Those countries with 
an above- average number of learning ad-
justed years of schooling in 2010 grew 
more strongly on average in the following 
decade. The striking regional differences 
suggest, however, that additional factors 
were important drivers of growth. Some 
Middle Eastern countries, in particular, 
posted quite small per capita growth des-
pite having a high number of learning ad-
justed years of schooling.
Against this background, measures to en-
hance human capital are of great import-
ance in EMEs’ economic catching- up pro-
cess. However, this is a long and drawn- out 
process. Over the past few decades, many 
EMEs have seen enormous progress in edu-
cational participation. Most recently, the 
length of schooling has increased in most 
regions; however, this was not always asso-ciated with equivalent gains in learning ad-
justed years of schooling. North Africa and 
the Middle East have even experienced set-
backs. In the 2010 to 2020 period, the aver-
age number of years of schooling increased 
by just over half a year, but that fi  gure de-
creased when measured in terms of learn-
ing outcomes.
The coronavirus pandemic represented a 
particular challenge to educational institu-
tions in EMEs, where school closures tended 
to last longer than in advanced economies 
and online learning opportunities were few 
and far between. The dropout rate rose. 
Studies indicate that learning losses aver-
aged three- quarters of a school year. Losses 
were mostly smaller in advanced econ-
omies.4 As EMEs’ economic catching- up 
process moves forward, one of their key 
challenges will be avoiding falling further 
behind advanced economies with regard to 
educational opportunities.

Increased macrofinancial risks
The global surge in inflation over the past two 
years, driven in part by the impact of the pan -
demic and the Russian war of aggression 
against Ukraine, led to a steep rise in interest 
rates in many countries. This poses particular 
risks for EMEs. In the past, periods of tighter 
international financing conditions have often 
led to monetary and financial crises in these 
countries, in some cases setting the affected 
economies back by years.20
However, the financial and monetary systems 
of EMEs proved comparatively robust during 
the global financial crisis of 2008-09.21 The im -
provement of the monetary policy framework 
in the preceding years, such as the strengthen -
ing of central bank independence and the 
introduction of binding inflation targets, is 
likely to have played an important role in this. 
As a result, many countries have managed to 
sustainably curb the previously high inflation 
rates. This, in turn, has been a key prerequisite 
for deepening domestic capital markets. As a 
result, some EMEs have increasingly been able 
to borrow in local currency – even abroad in 
many cases – which made it considerably easier 
to service such debt.22 The massive build- up of 
foreign reserves in some countries and the 
introduction of flexible exchange rates are also 
likely to have played a key role in strengthening 
resilience.
Nevertheless, a number of factors indicate that 
stability risks in EMEs have risen again of late. 
First, government debt grew sharply in many 
countries as a result of the economic strains 
caused by the pandemic. Even after the pan -
demic, fiscal deficits often remained high, 
partly to cushion the impact of sharp increases 
in energy and food prices. According to the 
IMF, EMEs’ general government debt increased 
from 55% of GDP in 2019 to 65% in 2022.23 In 
connection with the significant rise in interest 
rates, many EMEs are therefore likely to face 
considerable additional medium- term fiscal 
burdens from servicing their debt.Furthermore, some EMEs had already seen a 
significant rise in external debt, including pri -
vate debt, in the years prior to the pandemic. 
This was the case in sub-  Saharan Africa in par -
ticular.24 Such liabilities are very often denomin -
ated in foreign currency. As a result, many 
financially weaker debtor countries have been 
particularly hard hit by the recent sharp depre -
ciations of their currencies against the US dol -
lar.25
Against the backdrop of these developments, 
the financial situation in a number of EMEs has 
become much tighter in recent months. Exter -
nal financing via bonds has become increas -
ingly difficult, especially for poorer countries.

20 Examples include the debt crises in Latin America, espe -

Asia to other EMEs.
21 It is also noteworthy that all major commodity exporters 
were able to cope with the sharp fall in commodity prices 
between 2014 and 2016 without external assistance.
22 See Rogoff (2022).
23 In advanced economies, government debt rose from 
104% of GDP in 2019 to 112% in 2022.
24 China has increasingly emerged as a creditor of African 
countries, also in order to strengthen its trade relations 
with these countries and gain geopolitical influence.

cently defaulted or been close to doing so – far 
more than in the 2009-2019 period (37%).26
In the near term, the financing conditions for 
EMEs are set to remain challenging. This will be 
compounded by the persistently weak growth 
outlook in many countries. Overall, debt sus -
tainability appears to have deteriorated signifi -
cantly in many EMEs. Governments, but also 
private actors, are therefore likely to come 
under increasing deleveraging pressure. This, in 
turn, could further dampen the economic out -
look in these countries.
Need for action to strengthen 
climate protection
Climate change represents a double challenge 
for EMEs.27 First, it poses considerable physical 
risks to many of these countries. This is particu -
larly true for regions close to the equator, 
where the prevailing temperatures are already 
very high. Furthermore, their lower incomes 
make it more difficult for EMEs to cushion the 
impact of climate change and climate policy on 
their people and the economy.
Over the past few years, there has been grow -
ing international recognition that climate pro -
tection needs to be given a higher priority. EMEs have an important role to play in redu -
cing global CO₂ emissions. In 2022, EMEs ac -
counted for two- thirds of global CO₂ emis -
sions, almost half of which were attributable to 
China alone.28 Although per capita emissions 
are rather low in many EMEs, these countries’ 
emissions are comparatively high in relation to 
GDP and GDP growth. For example, the CO₂ 
intensity – defined here as the amount of CO₂ 
emissions in relation to GDP at purchasing 
power parities  – in EMEs has been just over 
one- and- a- half times higher than in advanced 
economies of late.29 This is due, in particular, to 
the large share of coal in energy production.30
In the coming years, EMEs’ CO₂ emissions are 
likely to continue to rise. At present, there is 
still a close link between economic growth and 
the increase in CO₂ emissions in these coun -
tries. By contrast, in many advanced economies 
decoupling has now progressed to such an ex -
tent that CO₂ emissions are declining despite 
positive economic growth.
It is important that EMEs also step up their ef -
forts to decarbonise their economies. However, 
meaningful CO₂ pricing has only been applied 
in a few EMEs to date.31 In addition, renewable 
energy would have to be used to a much 
greater extent. Many EMEs generally have Debt sustain-

27 Indicators pointing to the particularly high risk in many 
EMEs include the indices of the Notre Dame Global Adap -
tation Initiative (ND-  GAIN), which systematically capture 
climate risks for individual countries. See Notre Dame 
Global Adaptation Initiative (2021) and German Council of 
Economic Experts (2021).
28 It should be borne in mind that some of the EMEs’ 
emissions are generated by the production of goods that 
are exported to advanced economies and could therefore 
be attributed to the latter. See United Nations (2022).
29 Based on GDP at market exchange rates, the CO₂ inten -
sity in EMEs is actually three times as high as in advanced 
economies. As a measure of the efficiency of economic 
output, however, an assessment using purchasing power 
parities appears more appropriate, as it factors out prevail -
ing international price differences.
30 Coal is by far the most polluting fossil fuel. The burning 
of coal accounts for just over one- third of primary energy 
consumption in EMEs; in China, India and South Africa it 
even accounts for more than half. One factor here is that 
these countries have considerable domestic coal reserves.
31 China introduced an emissions trading scheme in 2021, 
but its current design is not very effective. See, inter alia,

good conditions for the production of renew -
able energy, and China is pushing ahead with 
this at full speed.32 Elsewhere, however, such 
projects often fail because of a lack of finan -
cing or due to political reasons.33
A number of EMEs, including Russia and coun -
tries in the Middle East, have specialised in ex -
porting fossil fuels. They face the particularly 
great challenge of weaning their economies 
from these exports in the long term.34 In recent 
years, some of them have expressed their in -
tention to diversify their economies. So far, 
however, these efforts have mostly been half-  
hearted, partly because business with oil and 
gas is still very profitable.
Outlook
The pace of economic growth in EMEs has de -
clined significantly in recent years. Many of the 
relevant drags on growth are likely to remain in 
place in the coming years. This is particularly 
true of the structural slowdown in growth in 
China, not only due to the growing demo -
graphic problems, but also because the poten -
tial for achieving productivity gains due to 
technology adaptation has diminished. A key 
factor here is therefore likely to be the extent 
to which the country can transform itself into 
an innovation- driven economy. Given the 
powerful governmental influence on the eco -
nomic and social system, the country’s success 
in this endeavour remains to be seen. Much 
will also depend on whether China continues 
to have access to the most advanced technolo -
gies in global markets.
Globalisation, which has long been an import -
ant catalyst for the development of many 
EMEs, could weaken considerably. In the near 
term, it will be important to keep the world 
trade order open. A lot here will rest on China, 
in particular. At the same time, the absence of 
a level playing field in the Chinese domestic 
market is also an important reason why, for 
some time now, many foreign firms have been pulling out of the country to a degree. Other 
EMEs are now filling this gap. India, in particu -
lar, has gained a foothold regarding the global 
production of electronic goods. For the world’s 
most populous country, this raises hopes of a 
faster process of industrialisation and conver -
gence. India could thus form a certain counter -
weight to China in the coming years.
EMEs specialised in the export of commodities 
would benefit from greater diversification in 
their economies. Given the volatility of inter -
national commodity markets, this could help to 
achieve more sustainable – and more broadly 
distributed – prosperity gains. In view of the 
increasing global climate effort, exporters of 
fossil fuels will probably be compelled to re -
align their economies anyway. The production 
and export of hydrogen could offer alternative 
development opportunities for some of these 
countries.35Exporters of

In an overall challenging environment, oppor -
tunities for EMEs will therefore also emerge in 
the coming years. The fact that EMEs’ incomes 
and productivity are still trailing far behind ad -
vanced economies would suggest that, in prin -
ciple, they still have abundant growth poten -
tial. However, an economic policy course needs to be set in order to harness this potential. It is 
through appropriate institutional, regulatory 
and educational reforms that EMEs are most 
likely to succeed in strengthening the forces of 
productivity and thus in giving new impetus to 
the economic catching- up process.

Discrepancies may arise from rounding.  * The banking system's liquidity position is
defined as the current account holdings in euro of euro area credit institutions with the
Eurosystem. Amounts are derived from the consolidated financial statement of the
Eurosystem and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  1 Figures are daily averages
for the reserve maintenance period ending in the month indicated. Following the
changeover in the frequency of Governing Council monetary policy meetings to a
six-week cycle, a reserve maintenance period no longer ends in every month. No figuresare available in such cases.  2 Source: ECB.  3 Includes liquidity provided under the
Eurosystem's asset purchase programmes.  4 From August 2009 includes liquidity

2002 euro banknotes and other banknotes which have been issued by the national cen-
tral banks of the Eurosystem and which are still in circulation. In accordance with the
accounting procedure chosen by the Eurosystem for the issue of euro banknotes, a
share of 8% of the total value of the euro banknotes in circulation is

allocated to the ECB on a monthly basis. The counterpart of this adjustment is shown
under “Other factors”. The remaining 92% of the value of the euro banknotes in
circulation is allocated, likewise on a monthly basis, to the NCBs, with each NCB
showing in its balance sheet the share of the euro banknotes issued corresponding to
its paid-up share in the ECB's capital. The difference between the value of the euro
banknotes allocated to an NCB and the value of the euro banknotes which that NCB
has put into circulation is likewise shown under “Other factors”. From 2003 eurobanknotes only.  6 Remaining items in the consolidated financial statement of the Euro-
system and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  7 Equal to the difference bet-
ween the sum of liquidity-pro viding factors and the sum of liquidity-absorbing factors.
8 Calculated as the sum of the “Deposit facility”, “Banknotes in circulation” and “Credit
institutions' current account balances”.

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).

ures based on the quarterly figures of the Federal Statistical Office, core budgets and
off-budget entities which are assigned to the general government sector.  2 The annual
figures do not tally with the sum of the quarterly figures, as the latter are all pro-
visional. The quarterly figures for some insurance sectors are estimated.  3 The develop-
ment of the types of expenditure recorded here is influenced in part by statisticalchangeovers.  4 Including discrepancies in clearing transactions between central, state
and local government.  5 On the revenue side, this contains proceeds booked as dis-
posals of equity interests and as loan repayments. On the expenditure side, this con-
tains the acquisition of equity interests and loans granted.  6 Excluding central govern-
ment liquidity assistance to the Federal Employment Agency.

* The effective exchange rate corresponds to the weighted external value of the curren-
cy concerned. The method of calculating the indicators of the German economy's price
competitiveness is consistent with the procedure to compute the effective exchange
rates of the euro. A decline in the figures implies an increase in competitiveness. The
weights are based on trade in manufactured goods and services. For more detailed in-
formation on methodology and weighting scale, see the website of the Deutsche
Bundesbank (https://www.bundesbank.de/content/796162).  1 The calculations are
based on the weighted averages of the changes in the bilateral exchange rates of the
euro vis-à-vis the currencies of the following 18 countries: Australia, Bulgaria, Canada,
China, Czechia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan, Norway, Poland, Romania,
Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United
States. Where current price and wage indices were not available, estimates were used.
2 Includes countries belonging to the extended EER group of trading partners (fixed
composition) and additionally the following 23 countries: Algeria, Argentina, Brazil,
Chile, Colombia, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, New Zea-
land, Peru, Philippines, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Taiwan,Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and United Arab Emirates. The ECB has suspended the
publication and calculation of the euro foreign exchange reference rate against Russian
rouble with effect from March 2, 2022 until further notice. For the calculation of
effective exchange rates, an indicative rate is used for the Russian Federation from that
date. It is calculated from the daily RUB/USD rates determined by the Bank of Russia in
conjunction with the respective ECB's euro foreign exchange reference rate to the US
dollar.  3 Annual and quarterly averages.  4 Euro area countries (from 2001 including
Greece, from 2007 including Slovenia, from 2008 including Cyprus and Malta, from
2009 including Slovakia, from 2011 including Estonia, from 2014 including Latvia, from
2015 including Lithuania, from 2023 including Croatia) as well as Canada, Denmark,
Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.
