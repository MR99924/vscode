5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Underlying trendsThe German economy was influenced by
temporary negative factors in the first quarterof this year. The construction sector, in par-ticular, was again hard hit by the extremelycold weather and heavy snowfalls. Industrialoutput is unlikely to have fully escaped theeffects of this, either. German industry wassuffering mainly from the effects of the sub-dued flow of new orders in the fourth quarterof last year, however. The sharp drop in thenumber of new car registrations, togetherwith the fact that there was little change inretail sales, indicates that private consump-tion is likely to have been reduced further inreal terms. Given that the construction indus-try was probably still suffering from the win-ter weather conditions in March as well, aslight decline in real GDP is to be expected forthe first quarter as a whole.
Despite the adverse effects at the beginning
of the year, the underlying upward trend inthe economy is still clearly identifiable, how-ever. According to surveys, the markedly im-proved assessment of the current businesssituation in all sectors and the distinct rise inindustrial orders since the beginning of theyear suggest that a rapid expansion in indus-trial output may be expected in the comingmonths. For the second quarter, the indica-tors are therefore promising a resumption ofthe economic recovery process which is notcharacterised purely by catch-up effects.German

Industrial output in February remained largely
unchanged on the month in seasonally ad-justed terms. If short-term fluctuations aredisregarded, this means that there had beenno expansion of output in the past fivemonths, despite the considerable rise indemand. This development applies equally tointermediate and capital goods. This sidewaysmovement is especially pronounced in themechanical engineering sector where it hadpersisted for almost one year. By contrast, themotor vehicle industry had been recoveringslightly since December. Commercial de-mand, which also includes automotive fleetbusiness, is now picking up following thediscontinuation of the car scrappage scheme.
There was no further increase in demand for
industrial goods in February. Following thesharp rise in January, the underlying trend isnow clearly pointing upwards, however. Onan average of January and February takentogether, there was a seasonally adjustedincrease of 4
1/C252% compared with the final
quarter of 2009. Orders placed with produ-cers of intermediate goods went up by a simi-lar amount and by as a much as 5
1/C252% in the
case of capital goods. Domestic orders roseby 4
3/C254% owing, in particular, to one major
order in January. The sharpest rise of late, at5
1/C252%, was in orders received from other
euro-area countries, whereas the figure forother countries, where fairly large increaseshad been recorded previously, was no morethan +3

7Although February saw a slight decline in
domestic sales of industrial goods in nominalterms, on an average of January and Februarythey remained unchanged in seasonally ad-justed terms compared with the fourth quar-ter of 2009. Export sales went up by 2
3/C254%,
however. Nominal exports of goods in Febru-ary were up 5% on the month, thus largelyoffsetting the sharp decline recorded in theprevious month. In contrast to export sales,however, exports still declined by a seasonallyadjusted 1
1/C252% in the first two months of the
year. Imports of goods in February againmatched the elevated level of the previousmonth. The foreign trade surplus went downto310
1/C252billion on an average of January and
February, compared with an average of 3151/C252
billion in the final quarter of 2009.
ConstructionWith continuing poor weather conditions,
construction activity in February increased by1% on the month. Following the slump inJanuary, however, construction output on anaverage of January and February was almost15% down on its level in the fourth quarterof 2009. The decline in the building industry,at 14
1/C252%, was not quite as sharp as in civil
engineering (-151/C254%). The weather is likely to
have affected construction activity in Marchas well. Orders received in January – morerecent figures are unavailable at present –showed an 8
3/C254% fall on the month, which
was likewise due to the weather.Labour market
According to the provisional figures of the
Federal Statistical Office, the number of per-sons in work went up slightly in February, aswas the case in the previous month. Theyear-on-year decline was unchanged at0.2%. According to initial estimates, Januarysaw hardly any change in employment sub-ject to social security contributions, followinga perceptible rise at the end of 2009. Thenumber of new registrations for short-timework showed a further fall in March to57,000, compared with 77,000 in February.According to both the Federal EmploymentAgency’s BA-X index for non-government-assisted jobs and the Ifo employment baro-meter for trade and industry, there was a per-ceptible improvement in March in the willing-ness of enterprises to recruit new staff.
There was a marked decline in unemploy-
ment in March after the period of cold wea-ther had ended. The number of persons outof work fell by a seasonally adjusted 31,000to 3.38 million. The unemployment rate fellby a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percentage pointcompared with the previous month’s figure(which was revised downward slightly) andnow stood at 8.0%. This was the first time inmore than 12 months that no year-on-yeargrowth had been recorded in the official stat-istics. Without the relief afforded by short-time work and special factors owing to thereorientation of labour market policy instru-ments, the unemployment figure would haveexceeded its prior-year level, however. Never-theless, the resilience of the German labourmarket in the crisis is still remarkable.Domestic sales

8Prices
Crude oil prices fluctuated with no clear
trend in March, trading within a relativelynarrow band between US$78 and US$82 perbarrel. Nevertheless, the spot price for BrentNorth Sea oil in March, at US$80 per barrelon a monthly average, was still 7
1/C252% higher
than in February. This was due to the factthat oil prices had declined temporarilybetween mid-January and mid-February.Against the backdrop of favourable economicdata, especially from the USA, prices went upperceptibly in early April. As this report wentto press, the spot price stood at US$87
1/C254.
Prices for future deliveries of crude oil wereagain being quoted with marked premiums;US$2
1/C254and US$5 were being charged for
six-month and 18-month deliveries respect-ively.
At the upstream stages of the economy, the
earlier sharp rise in input prices – at least inthe case of imports – is now being reflectedquite clearly in finished products. By contrast,the prices for energy – owing to a temporaryfall in oil prices on an average of February –went up significantly less sharply than inJanuary and even declined in Germany. Pricepressure in the case of intermediate goodsalso eased somewhat in February. Despite thestronger upward trend in the case of somefinished goods, upward price pressure in theimport sector and in domestic sales weak-ened slightly overall. At a seasonally adjusted0.7%, import prices did not rise as sharply inFebruary as they had done in January. Theyear-on-year rate went up further to 2.6%.Seasonally adjusted producer prices of indus-trial products remained unchanged on the
month in February, compared with +0.7% inJanuary. The year-on-year figure was still-2.9%.
Seasonally adjusted consumer prices went up
quite sharply by 0.6% in March following adecline of 0.2% in February. This was due,first and foremost, to higher energy pricesand a marked rise in the cost of food. In theperiod under review, consumers had to paymore for mineral oil products. This was attrib-utable to higher crude oil prices as well as asignificant widening of the margins for fuel.As a result, the energy component of theGerman consumer price index increased upby 2.2% in seasonally adjusted terms. In thecase of food products, the very cold winterweather continued to be reflected in higherprices of fruit and vegetables in March. Therewas hardly any increase in the cost of pro-cessed food, however. Despite pronouncedeffects of the seasonal sales in January andFebruary, the index for goods (excluding foodand energy) went up only moderately in sea-sonally adjusted terms with the introductionof the new collections. There was quite asharp rise in the prices of services. The rise inrents remained subdued. According to thenational consumer price index (CPI), con-sumer prices in March were 1.1% up on theyear overall. The corresponding HICP figurewas 1.2%. In February, the annual rates were+0.6% and +0.5% respectively. The earlydate of Easter contributed to the sharp in-crease in the year-on-year figures.

9Public finances1
Local government finances
According to the latest cash statistics data
provided by the Federal Statistical Office, thedeterioration in the budgetary situation oflocal government is likely to have slowed to-wards the end of 2009.
2While a deficit of
31/C252billion was recorded in the final quarter of
2009 compared with a surplus of 32 billion
one year previously, the deficit expansion hadbeen significantly larger in previous quarters.This moderation was ultimately due to aslowdown in the decline in local business taxreceipts year-on-year and somewhat moresubdued growth in expenditure on thewhole.
In net terms, the budgetary situation deterior-
ated massively in 2009 as a whole: the deficitamounted to just over 37 billion compared
with a surplus of just over 37
1/C252billion in
2008. Revenue fell by just under 3% (or 35
billion). This was chiefly attributable to themarked decline in tax revenue (-11
1/C252%, or 38
billion), resulting to a large extent from devel-opments in local business tax, which had pre-viously been highly remunerative (-19
1/C252%, or
36 billion, after deduction of the shares
accruing to other government levels). Higherinvestment grants and general grants fromstate government (+2%, or 3
3/C254billion, in
total), including in particular funds from thesecond economic stimulus package, and aone-off dividend distribution by the Munichpublic utilities fell far short of compensatingfor this slump. At the same time, growth inexpenditure accelerated to 6% (or 310 bil-lion). A prominent contributory factor was
the steep rise in personnel expenditure (+5%,or32 billion) – not least due to the second
stage of the wage increases agreed in 2008 –,in other operating expenditure (+5
1/C252%, or 32
billion) and in social benefits (+5%, or 32 bil-
lion), whereby only a small part of the lattercan be attributed to accommodation costsfor the long-term unemployed. Non-financialLocal government fiscal

1In the short report on public finances which regularly
appears in the Monthly Report, the emphasis is on recent
outturns. The quarterly editions of the Monthly Reports
(published in February, May, August and November), by
contrast, contain a detailed description of general gov-
ernment budget trends during the preceding quarter. For
detailed statistical data on budgetary developments and
public debt, see the statistical section of this report.
2The problem of sharp intra-year fluctuations and revi-
sions still persists as a result of incomplete or incorrect
recordings following the introduction by many local gov-
ernments of the commercial double-entry bookkeeping
system. Consequently, the Federal Statistical Office has
again decided to publish cumulated cash statistics data
rather than a detailed breakdown for individual quarters.Slight deficit

10asset formation also rose steeply (+51/C252%, or
31 billion) driven mainly by the launch of the
second economic stimulus package. Specialeffects ensued as a result of substantial acqui-sitions of participating interests by the citiesof Stuttgart ( 31 billion participation in the
capital increase of Baden W/C252rttemberg’sLandesbank, LBBW) and Munich (capital in-jection of just over 31 billion into the public
utilities from their one-off dividend distri-bution). By contrast, interest expendituredeclined perceptibly (-15%, or 3
3/C254billion),
probably chiefly due to lower interest rateson cash advances. However, the FederalStatistical Office has stressed that, followingthe introduction by many local governmentsof the double-entry bookkeeping system in2008, the previous year’s figures for someexpenditure categories may be understated.
3
Notwithstanding the clear deterioration inthe budgetary situation of local government,at the end of 2009 credit market debtdeclined by 31
1/C252billion to 375 billion on the
end of 2008. This development was probablydue, at least in part, to the outsourcing of en-tities with credit market liabilities. By contrast,the volume of short-term cash advances ex-panded rapidly again by 35 billion (to almost
335 billion) compared with the end of 2008.
Growth per capita in the states of Rhineland-Palatinate, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saar-land was especially strong. These states hadalso recorded the highest levels per capita atthe end of 2008. This is proof of the particu-lar budget difficulties experienced by manylocal governments in these states. However, alarge share of the total deficit of 37 billion is
also likely to have been financed usingwithdrawals from reserves. These reserves
may soon be exhausted in many local govern-ments, though. Hence, if high deficits persist,greater financing on the credit markets willbe necessary. This year, expected further not-able growth in social expenditure, a reneweddecline in tax revenue and lower generalgrants from state government (adjusted tothe unfavourable developments in state gov-ernment tax revenue with a time lag) willplace additional strains on local government.However, the latest pay settlement will giverise to only moderate additional costs. Over-all, local government deficits are likely toexpand considerably again in 2010. As yet,no fiscal policies have been put in place toachieve the speedy drastic reduction of thesedeficits which is needed to comply with localgovernment budgetary rules.
Securities markets
Bond marketIn February 2010, the issue volume in the
German bond market decreased to 3100.3
billion compared with gross issuance of3117.3 billion in the previous month. After
deducting redemptions, which likewise de-clined markedly, ( 387.8 billion) and including
changes in issuers’ holdings of their ownbonds, 317.0 billion were invested in the
German bond market on balance. At thesame time, foreign debt instruments were re-deemed in the amount of 34.9 billion net.

11Therefore, the volume of outstanding debt
securities in Germany increased by 312.0 bil-
lion in the reporting month, compared with312.3 billion in the previous month.
In February, the public sector raised 319.8 bil-
lion in the bond market. Central governmentincreased its capital market debt by 315.9 bil-
lion. It issued mainly two-year Federal Treas-ury notes (Sch/C228tze) for 37.5 billion, five-year
Federal notes (Bobls) to the tune of 35.5 bil-
lion as well as ten-year Federal bonds (Bunds)for35.0 billion and, to a lesser extent, 30-year
Federal bonds ( 30.7 billion). Meanwhile, 32.8
billion worth of Treasury discount paper(Bubills) were redeemed. The Federal statesexpanded their capital market debt by 33.7
billion.
German credit institutions once again re-
duced their capital market debt in February,by37.5 billion (compared with 317.1 billion
in the previous month). Specialised credit in-stitutions in particular, some of which benefitfrom government guarantees, reduced thevolume of their debt securities in circulationby34.6 billion. Public Pfandbriefe were also
redeemed for 32.3 billion on balance, also to
a lesser extent other bank debt securitieswhich can be structured particularly flexiblyas well as mortgage Pfandbriefe ( 30.5 billion
and30.1 billion respectively).
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises
tapped the bond market for 34.7 billion in
net terms. The instruments issued were, onbalance, all bonds with original maturities ofmore than one year.On the German bond market in February for-
eign investors were the main net buyers,adding 316.1 billion worth of bonds to their
portfolios on balance. The majority were pub-lic debt securities. Domestic non-banks ac-quired debt securities for 33.9 billion, on bal-
ance exclusively domestic paper. By contrast,domestic credit institutions sold bonds for37.9 billion.
Equity marketIn February, German enterprises raised barely
any funds by issuing new shares ( 30.1 billion
compared with 31.4 billion in the previous
month). By contrast, the volume of foreignshares in the German market fell by 30.7 bil-
lion. Shares were purchased by foreign invest-ors, who added 32.1 billion worth of GermanSales and purchases

12equities to their portfolios. Furthermore do-
mestic non-banks acquired shares worth 32.0
billion. Domestic credit institutions were theonly net sellers of shares, offloading paperworth 34.8 billion.
Mutual fund sharesIn February, domestic mutual funds recorded
inflows of 35.7 billion. Funds open to the
general public and those reserved for institu-tional investors benefited almost equally(32.9 billion and 32.8 billion respectively). Of
the funds open to the public, open-end realestate funds in particular recorded inflows(31.1 billion), as did equity-based funds ( 30.9
billion) and mixed securities funds ( 30.6 bil-
lion). To a lesser extent bond-based funds aswell as mixed funds also sold new mutualfund shares ( 30.2 billion in both cases). In
February foreign enterprises also sold 32.0
billion worth of fund shares on the Germanmarket. Mutual fund shares were purchasedprimarily by domestic non-banks ( 35.2 billion)
but also by domestic credit institutions ( 32.0
billion). Foreign investors acquired 30.4 billion
worth net of mutual fund shares.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur-
plus – in unadjusted terms – of 39.1 billion in
February 2010. The result was thus 34.7 bil-
lion up on the level of the previous month.This was primarily due to a rise in the tradesurplus. However, there was also a slight in-crease in the deficit on invisible current trans-actions, which comprise services, income and
current transfers.
According to provisional figures from the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, in February the foreigntrade surplus rose by 34.6 billion on the
month to 312.6 billion. After adjustment for
seasonal and calendar variations, it went upby33.3 billion to 312.1 billion. The value
of exports rose by 5.1 % while that of im-ports increased by just 0.2 %. In the January-February period, however, seasonally adjust-ed nominal exports were 1.6 % lower thanthe average of the fourth quarter of 2009. Bycontrast, imports posted an increase of6.9 %, almost half of which was attributableto higher import prices.
The deficit on invisible current transactions
grew slightly from 32.8 billion in January to
32.9 billion in February. Parallel to this, the
deficit on current transfers expanded by 31.9
billion to 36.3 billion. By contrast, the deficit
on services contracted from 31.9 billion to
30.3 billion while net receipts from cross-
border income rose by 30.2 billion to 33.7 bil-
lion.
Cross-border portfolio investment led to net
capital imports in February ( 323.8 billion),
compared with outflows amounting to 315.9
billion in the previous month. The main rea-son for this was foreign portfolio investors’regained interest in German securities ( 318.7
billion) after previously curbing their invest-ment activity in this area. With their attentionpredominantly focused on debt securities(316.1 billion), they purchased not only public

13money market instruments ( 32.6 billion). In
addition, these investors acquired shares(32.1 billion) and mutual fund shares ( 30.4
billion). At the same time, German investorsreduced their investment in foreign securities(35.1 billion). In the main, they sold debt
securities ( 34.9 billion). However, they also
disposed of foreign shares ( 32.1 billion). In
particular, they disposed of foreign currencybonds ( 33.0 billion) as well as money market
instruments ( 35.2 billion). By contrast, resi-
dent investors acquired euro-denominatedbonds and notes issued by non-residents(33.2 billion).
In February, direct investment again resulted
in net capital exports ( 39.4 billion, compared
with 37.7 billion in January). The decisive
factor here was that – as in the precedingmonth – domestic enterprises provided theirforeign affiliates with funds ( 39.8 billion).
There was a particular emphasis on bolsteringtheir equity capital ( 37.4 billion) and on
reinvesting earnings ( 32.8 billion). The direct
investment activities of foreign enterprises inGermany generated moderate capital inflows(30.4 billion). These were largely the result of
reinvested earnings ( 31.2 billion).
Other statistically recorded capital flows com-
prising financial and trade credits (wherethese do not constitute direct investment) aswell as bank deposits and other assets sawnet capital exports of 321.3 billion in Febru-
ary, compared with net capital imports of345.8 billion in January. Non-banks’ trans-
actions resulted in outflows of 35.6 billion.

15Government debt
and interest payment
burden in GermanyOver the past few decades, govern-
ment debt in Germany has risen sharp-ly, both in absolute terms and relativeto gross domestic product. During thesame period, government net assetshave progressively been depleted. Infuture, debt growth is to be narrowlyrestricted by the new debt rule. How-ever, central government is initially ex-pecting the debt ratio to continueclimbing, reaching a record high ofover 80% by 2013. Since the 1990s, theadditional strains placed on public fi-nances by rising debt have been ob-scured by the decline in interest rates.Although this trend will initially con-tinue, it will not do so indefinitely.Given a sharp rise in debt in the shortterm, an increase in the currently verylow level of interest rates would actu-ally lead relatively quickly to budget-ary burdens amounting to billions ofeuros, thus heightening the alreadyconsiderable need for consolidation.The financial and economic crisis hasrecently provided abundant evidenceof the advantages of a moderate gov-ernment debt level, and these aregaining in significance in view of thedemographic trend. Germany’s centralgovernment has affirmed that boththe national and the European con-solidation requirements will be met,which is important for the debt ratio;however, this commitment has yet tobe underpinned with concrete meas-ures.

16Introduction and overview
Over the past few decades, government debt
in Germany has increased significantly. Thistrend has recently been greatly reinforced bythe financial and economic crisis. Across theworld, government debt levels are now risingdramatically, and this has heightened fears insome quarters that debt dynamics are unsus-tainable. This article examines the develop-ment of the German government’s debt andits interest payment burden. A brief generaldiscussion of the possible justifications forgovernment borrowing is followed by anaccount of developments in Germany and anoutline of the conclusions to be drawn forfiscal policy.
From an economic perspective, government
borrowing is not inherently advantageous ordisadvantageous; it can be justified for anumber of reasons. However, governmentdebt always entails costs, and high indebted-ness, in particular, is associated with especial-ly large risks. It is important to remember thatgovernment borrowing activities are basedon specific political incentive structures thatharbour the danger of high and rising debtlevels. This explains the rationale – in Ger-many and elsewhere – behind rules aimed atrestraining snowballing growth in govern-ment debt.
For example, government borrowing can be
justified within the framework of the auto-matic stabilisers. Macroeconomic develop-ments can usually be stabilised by toleratingcyclically induced fluctuations in the fiscalbalance without taking countermeasures. Inprinciple, however, this does not cause a last-
ing increase in government debt as the debtlevel climbs during recessions but falls backin boom periods provided that the struc-tural orientation of fiscal policy remains un-changed. Nor would an active discretionaryeconomic policy aimed at stabilisation intypical business cycles lead to a sustainedincrease in debt if applied symmetrically inupturns and downturns. In light of previousexperiences – particularly with regard to polit-ical incentives, the impact of which can beheightened by difficulties in accurately assess-ing the economic situation at the time – it ishighly unlikely that such a policy would beimplemented successfully, especially with re-spect to the requirement of symmetry. More-over, targeted debt-financed measures canbe deemed necessary in response to particu-larly severe economic crises or in the event ofnatural disasters. Nonetheless, as there is nostipulated automatic redemption once theseexceptional burdens cease to exist, safe-guards must be put in place if a lasting expan-sion of debt is to be avoided.
Government borrowing can generally be jus-
tified by the argument that it will achieve atargeted long-term intertemporal distributionof burdens. It is often contended that a fairerdistribution of financial burdens can beachieved by debt-financing asset expansionsthat will be beneficial in the future (the“golden rule”). However, this makes a suffi-ciently diligent assessment of the costs andbenefits very important. Moreover, given thepolitical inclination towards government bor-rowing, such a rule – like a discretionarymacro-management of the economy – is ex-

17tremely difficult to apply in fiscal policy prac-
tice, as demonstrated by the ineffectivenessof the borrowing limit in Germany in recentdecades.
1The government net asset ratio has
thus seen a sharp decline on balance sincethe mid-1970s despite the existence of a limitmodelled on the “golden rule”. With regardto the intergenerational distribution of finan-cial burdens, account should be taken notonly of explicit government debt but also ofimplicit future burdens on public finances inconnection with demographic change, aboveall in the area of social security. In addition torestricting growth in age-related expenditure,a process which has already been initiatedwith the fundamental pension reforms ofthe past two decades, restricting debt at anearly stage can play an important part in en-suring more equal intergenerational burden-sharing.

The adverse effects of additional governmentborrowing become particularly important ifthe debt ratio is already high. They include apotential crowding out of private investment,uncertainties and distortions arising from ex-pected or actual future increases in the bur-den of taxes and social security contributions,as well as substantial risk premiums on thecapital markets due to growing concernsabout the government’s solvency. Further-more, if debt ratios are high, the effectivenessof targeted debt-financed measures aimed ataverting particularly severe crises is likely tobe increasingly limited. In addition, the dan-ger of conflicts between fiscal and monetarypolicy, which cause major macroeconomiccosts, grows, whereas sound public financesimprove the conditions for a stability-oriented
monetary policy.
The danger of excessive government debt is
caused, not least, by the existence of the pol-itically appealing option of using loans todefer the counterfinancing of expenditure in-creases or tax cuts to the future. For thisreason, budgetary rules for preventing overlyhigh indebtedness are common in many partsof the world. The specific form these rulestake, budgetary transparency and public sup-port are all key to ensuring their effective-ness.Government net assets *

18Deuts che Bun desbankDynami cs of debt ratios
The general government debt ratio is the ratio 
between government debt an d nominal GDP. It 
chan ges over time if debt grows more qui ckly or more 
slowly than nominal GDP. In a simpliﬁ  ed analysis, the 
growth in debt correspon ds to a given year ’s deﬁ cit, 
whi ch can be split into interest payments an d the 
primary balan ce.1 The development of the debt ratio 
may be represente d as
bt – bt-1 = 1 + gt   λt   · bt-1 – pt  ,where bt denotes the debt ratio at the en d of perio d t, 
pt the primary balan ce ratio, an d λt = (rt – gt ) the inter-
est- growth differential (with gt as the nominal growth 
rate of GDP an d rt as the nominal avera ge interest rate 
on government debt). The equation makes clear that 
the chan ge in the debt ratio depen ds not only on the 
primary balan ce ratio but also on the interest- growth 
differential an d the debt ratio one perio d earlier. If 
the interest- growth differential is positive, a positive 
primary balan ce is require d in or der to prevent a rise 
in the debt ratio. The hi gher the prior-year debt ratio 
an d the current-year interest- growth differential are, 
the hi gher this primary surplus must be.
The a djacent chart shows interest rates, growth rates 
an d the resultin g primary balan ces nee ded to sta bilise 
the given debt ratios for the Fe deral Repu blic of Ger-
many sin ce the early 1970s. A ctual primary balan ces 
are set a gainst require d primary balan ces. In ea ch case, 
the avera ge values of the varia bles for the in dividual 
decades are displaye d in or der to hi ghli ght stru ctural 
developments.
It is evi dent that the nominal avera ge interest pai d on 
outstan ding government debt was, in all past three 
decades, hi gher than nominal GDP growth. The calcul-
ations shown illustrate that, as the interest- growth 
differential for this perio d was positive, a marke d

19Fun damentally, the present-perio d general govern-
ment debt may be re garded as sustaina ble only if it 
is covere d by the sum of all discounte d future primary 
surpluses. In this context, it is ultimately the inter gen-
erational burden resultin g from government a ctivities 
that is inﬂ  uen ced by the temporal distri bution of 
the primary balan ces. Shiftin g the ne cessary primary 
surpluses into the future woul d appear parti cularly 
dubious if the a ccumulate d debt is not a ccompanie d 
by any in come- generatin g sto cks of assets or if a ddi-
tional inter generational burden shifts resultin g, say, 
from a rise in a ge-relate d spen ding are to be expe cted 
anyway.6
Furthermore, it shoul d be note d that hi gh govern-
ment debt ratios, in parti cular, may themselves have 
an impa ct on the e conomy an d, therefore, on the 
interest- growth differential. A dire ct a dverse effe ct 
on the interest rate level may o ccur as a result of risk 
premiums into whi ch hi gher pro babilities of default 
are in corporate d owin g to expe cted sustaina bility 
pro blems, for example. If dou bts arise as to whether 
primary surpluses nee ded to servi ce future debt can 
(or, from the stan dpoint of poli cymakers, shoul d) be 
realise d, interest payments may initially carry hi gh risk 
premiums; in extreme cases, it may become impossi ble 
to sell debt se curities in the ﬁ  nan cial markets. As soon 
as su ch developments become apparent, if not earlier, 
sharp an d rapi d corre ctions of the ﬁ  scal poli cy stan ce 
will be the only option. Empiri cally, it can be o bserve d 
that countries with hi gh debt ratios ten d to have 
higher fun ding costs for government debt.
Moreover, an in crease in government debt – even irre-
spe ctive of any risk premium for the soverei gn  – may 
lea d to a general rise in interest rates an d thus inter 
alia to a crow ding out of private investment.7 Re duc-
tions in growth are to be expe cted in this context, 
espe cially if the government spen ding contri butin g to the debt is una ble to offset the losses of pro ductivity 
in the e conomy as a whole cause d by lower private 
investment. The less the private se ctor a djusts savin g 
to the chan ge in government debt an d to the result-
ing hi gher future tax payments, the more severe the 
crow ding-out effe cts are.8 In an open e conomy, an d 
given the international mo bility of capital, both the 
positive an d ne gative effe cts of national poli cy are 
sprea d more broa dly9 an d ex chan ge rates, capital 
ﬂ ows an d current a ccount balan ces may be affe cted.
Given a positive interest- growth differential, a hi gher 
general government debt implies the ne cessity of a 
higher primary surplus in future perio ds. This can be 
achieve d – at least in part – by a dditional taxes. How-
ever, the asso ciate d distortions, in parti cular, result in 
further losses of potential growth. A further fa ctor 
in this context is that a lo cation mi ght become less 
attra ctive both for skille d la bour an d investors from 
abroa d owin g to the future prospe ct of a hi gher tax 
burden.10
High government debts also make a sta bility-oriente d 
monetary poli cy more difﬁ cult as it is then more difﬁ -
cult to an chor inﬂ  ation expe ctations at an appropriate 
level. If investors har bour dou bts a bout the sustain-
ability of pu blic ﬁ nan ces an d therefore re gard hi gher 
inﬂ ation as a possi bility, the lon g-term nominal inter-
est rate mi ght come un der upwar d pressure owin g to 
a rise in both inﬂ  ation expe ctations an d inﬂ ation risk 
premiums. As a result, a sta bility-oriente d monetary 
poli cy woul d be more restri ctive than otherwise 
require d. Overall, this coul d lea d a deterioration in 
con ditions for real e conomi c growth. If a ctual pri ce 
developments then remain un chan ged owin g to the 
monetary poli cy response, there will be an inevita ble 
widenin g of the interest- growth differential, makin g 
the nee d for consoli dation even more a cute.

20All in all, the development of the government
debt ratio is of great importance when as-sessing public finances. The main factors af-fecting the debt ratio are generally the exist-ing debt level, the interest rate, nominalgrowth of gross domestic product (GDP) andthe general government primary balance (iethe fiscal balance excluding interest pay-ments). If nominal interest rates exceed nom-inal GDP growth, as they have on a ten-yearaverage for the past three decades in Ger-many, a positive primary balance is necessaryto prevent explosive debt growth. The higherthe debt ratio and the greater the differencebetween the interest rate and growth, thelarger the primary surpluses must be (formore information on this subject and on themacroeconomic effects of government debt,see the box on pages 18 and 19). In Germany,the fiscal stance ultimately was not ambitiousenough to prevent a rise in the debt ratio.
Development of government debt in
Germany
Sharp rise in debt ratio in three stagesGovernment debt
3in Germany has risen al-
most continuously since the Federal Republicof Germany was founded. Regarding thegovernment debt ratio, three large upsurges,each amounting to almost 20 percentagepoints, can be identified. The first was con-nected with attempts to actively manage de-mand following the oil price shocks of 1973and 1979-80, the second with the adjust-ment following German unification up to1996, and the third with the financial and
economic crisis from 2008 onward.
From 1950 to 1970, the debt ratio remained
relatively stable at just under 20%. At theend of the 1960s, the constitutional borrow-ing limits for central and state governmentwere changed. Subsequently, public financeswere required to take account of the need tomaintain the macroeconomic equilibrium.The aim was for new borrowing to beexpanded during economic downturns andcut during boom periods. In principle, it waseven possible to overshoot the already gener-ous standard borrowing limit – equivalent insize to the total budgeted investment ex-penditure – by an unlimited sum if this wasrequired in order to avert a disruption ofthe macroeconomic equilibrium. By contrast,there was no explicit obligation during up-turns to repay debts incurred in such circum-stances. The years of very high new net bor-rowing during the economic crises triggeredby the oil price shocks were followed byperiods of merely more moderate debtgrowth. In the first two decades in which thisconstitutional rule was applied, debt growthaccelerated significantly overall. At the end of1990, the debt level reached almost 3540 bil-
lion, or around 40% of GDP .
The unification of Germany placed consider-
able additional strains on public finances, par-ticularly with regard to improving infrastruc-

21Debt as defined in the government’s financial statistics and under the Maastricht
Treaty
Debt level in national financial statistics
In Germany, the Federal Statistical Office collects data
on government debt on the basis of the Public Financeand Personnel Statistics Law (Finanz- und Personal-
statistikgesetz) .
1Government debt comprises the debt
of central, state and local government including spe-cial purpose associations. Special Federal funds – suchas the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund or the In-vestment and Repayment Fund – and similar entitiesbelonging to individual states are also included. Bycontrast, it does not contain the liabilities of socialsecurity funds, which are generally not permitted toobtain funding on the credit market anyway. The fi-nancial statistics cover the period from 1950 onwards.However, over the course of the past decades, a num-ber of changes have been introduced which, to someextent, has limited the comparability of data overtime. Publicly owned and operated enterprises were in-cluded up to 1973 and hospitals keeping commercialaccounts up to 1992. At state level, the debt of thoseenterprises and other entities, such as road construc-tion enterprises, universities and outsourced statisticalinstitutes, belonging to the government sector hasadditionally been included in the financial statisticssince 2006. In the case of municipal special purposeassociations, debts of entities keeping commercial ac-counts have since been omitted from the reportinggroup. Overall, however, the revisions are not likely tohave had a decisive impact on the underlying trends.
Maastricht debt levelAs part of the EU budgetary surveillance procedure,
the level of general government debt under the Maas-tricht Treaty is fixed as a central fiscal indicator at a ref-erence value of 60% of GDP. The methodological basisis the European System of Accounts (ESA 1995), whichis legally binding in the EU.
2Over the years, Eurostat
has issued a series of individual methodological deci-sions defining certain aspects of the ESA more preciselyor adding to it, not least in order to eliminate thepossibility of an unwarranted (from an economic per-spective) use of scope when calculating the debt leveland also to ensure that the actual situation is reflectedas accurately as possible.In addition to credit market debt and cash advances as
included in the government’s financial statistics, theMaastricht definition of debt comprises several othertypes of liabilities – notably the volume of coins incirculation and imputed borrowing, such as surrogatefinancing. One example of this is the transactionsbetween the German government and the KfW Bank(Kreditanstalt f/C252r Wiederaufbau) where the govern-
ment transferred shares at a discount but secured aparticipating interest in the performance of theseshares and ultimately has thus not relinquished eco-nomic ownership. Furthermore, the definition alsocovers cash collateral paid to the government as partof derivative transactions. In addition, if the govern-ment assumes certain project risks in public-privatepartnerships or instructs – typically publicly owned –enterprises to enter into transactions on its behalf thatgenerate borrowing requirements, respective amountsof debt are assigned to the government. Securitisationtransactions where the government transfers only partof economic ownership or which are based on futuretax or social contribution revenues are also recorded inthe debt. In Germany, the securitisation in 2005 and2006 of future payments by the postal services’ succes-sor enterprises for forthcoming civil servant pensionsby the Federal Pension Service for Post and Telecom-munications (Bundespensionsservice Post und Telekom-
munikation) , which is allocated to the government sec-
tor, is also recorded in the debt level.
3
One general rule which has become particularly signifi-cant in view of the financial crisis is that debt relief en-tities initiated by, acting in the interests of and shield-ed from risk by the government are to be assigned tothe government. This is driving up the Maastricht debtlevel by the amount of their liabilities. However, Euro-stat’s decision of July 2009 has temporarily modifiedthis rule by attaching greater importance to the issueof legal ownership of these entities
4but, overall, these
changes have so far not had any impact on such casesin Germany.
In total the Maastricht debt level amounted to 51,762
billion (73.2% of GDP) at the end of 2009 whereas thedebt level as defined in the government’s financialstatistics amounted to 51,692 billion.

ure from valuation at market price, which is the standardmethod under ESA 1995, the Maastricht debt level is de-fined at nominal value. — 3As a rule, the Maastricht debt
level does not include ESA categories such as other ac-counts payable (eg trade credit), derivative liabilities (egliabilities arising from interest and currency swaps) or
insurance technical reserves (eg for pension liabilities).Impracticalities inherent in the measurement of theseitems were cited as reasons for their exclusion. Forinstance, trade payables are not generally recorded underthe cameralistic accounting system. — 4See also Deutsche

22ture and social benefits in the east German
states, while economic growth deceleratedsignificantly. Overall, the debt ratio soared to58% by 1996. The European reference valueof 60% was exceeded for the first time in1998. This rise flattened out in the years thatfollowed; however, as high budget deficitscontinued to be recorded – particularly inphases of weaker macroeconomic develop-ment – and additional borrowing occurredeven in boom years, the debt ratio rose to68% by the end of 2005. It then declinedsomewhat to 65% by 2007.
However, the financial and economic crisis
has led the debt ratio to rise again dramatical-ly, reaching around 73% last year. In the sta-bility programme adopted at the beginningof 2010, central government forecast that itwould reach 82% in 2013. This figure was
calculated under the assumption of both rela-tively strong economic growth and the imple-mentation of steps towards consolidation,even though no measures for achieving thelatter were cited. In addition, the effects ofthe further tax cut envisaged in the centralgovernment’s coalition agreement and theestablishment of new debt relief entities forbanks were not factored into the calculation.Consequently, substantial risks remain in thisarea.
Central government with highest debtThe individual levels of government were
affected differently by these developments.Particularly in the 1960s, the rate at whichcentral government’s debt grew was still dis-proportionately slow, and its share in totaldebt fell to less than 40% by 1973. At theend of 1989, however, central government– with debts amounting to almost 3255 bil-
lion – already accounted for 53
1/C252% of credit
liabilities. The costs of German unificationwere initially financed largely outside thecentral government budget via the Treuhandagency (which dealt mainly with state-ownedenterprises in eastern Germany). However,when the agency’s liabilities were assumed bythe Redemption Fund for Inherited Liabilitiesin 1995, the level of debt attributed to centralgovernment soared to almost 3660 billion,
and its share in total general governmentdebt reached an all-time high of 64
1/C252%. The

in total debt.
Federal states with sharply divergent
debt levels
In 1950, the federal states still had the
highest share in government debt; however,this subsequently fell significantly, reachingaround one-fifth in the 1960s. As in the caseof central government, new borrowing in-creased in the wake of the oil price shocks.This expansion was facilitated by the reformof budgetary legislation. While state govern-
ment debts more than doubled between1950 and 1970, they increased twelvefold inthe following two decades. Following furtherstrong growth, debt levels temporarily stabil-ised from 2006 to 2008 before rising againvery steeply in 2009. State government’sshare in total debt was 31% at last report.
Nonetheless, it should be borne in mind that
developments in the individual federal stateshave varied widely in the past, and continueto do so at present. With per capita creditmarket debt levels of 31,770 and 32,280 re-
spectively (compared with a nationwide aver-age of 35,870), Bavaria and Saxony were the
federal states with the lowest debt levels atthe end of 2008, having both adopted ageneral legal ban on new borrowing in theirCentral, state and local government debt

the highest per capita debt levels were re-corded by Saarland ( 39,180) and Saxony-
Anhalt ( 38,260); the latter, like Saxony, had
begun 1990 with virtually no debt. Levelsamong the city states (including the local gov-ernment tier, which is less indebted) wereeven higher, with Bremen posting the largestfigure ( 323,080). Whereas per capita debt
growth in Saxony has effectively been at astandstill since 2000, Bremen recorded an in-crease of four-fifths in the same period.
The Federal Constitutional Court ruled in
1992 that, in connection with their highlevels of debt, Bremen and Saarland werefacing a situation of extreme budgetary hard-ship, meaning that all other members of theGerman federation had an obligation to pro-vide assistance. However, a comparable peti-
tion by Berlin was rejected in the autumn of2006 inter alia on the grounds that Berlin had
not yet exhausted all of its own possibilities toresolve the situation. When the new constitu-tional borrowing limit obliging the federalstates to achieve structurally balancedbudgets from 2020 onward was agreed, tem-porary financial assistance was arranged infive of the federal states in response todoubts over whether the limit would be prac-ticable. In the wake of the financial crisis,some federal states have now found them-selves confronted not only with substantialtax shortfalls but also with considerable riskstriggered by the financial difficulties of theirLandesbanken. These difficulties are reflectedin the debt levels recorded in the financialstatistics mainly by capital injections totalling327

Local government with restrictivebudgetary rules and large differencesbetween individual local authorities
In the years following the establishment of
the Federal Republic of Germany, local gov-ernment saw a particularly sharp rise in creditliabilities, which followed the investmenttrend. While in 1950 local government’sshare in total debt was only 1%, it rose to37% by 1973. Unlike central and state gov-ernment, local government did not see anacceleration in the debt development in the1970s; instead, growth declined. When theDistribution of debt among

25local government budgetary rules were
changed, they continued to take account ofthe “capability concept”, under which evi-dence of sufficient financial capacity is im-posed as a general prerequisite for borrowingto finance budgets. While the debt leveldoubled by 1990, local government’s sharein general government liabilities fell backsubstantially to 12%. Despite the continuedoverall increase in local government indebt-edness following the unification of Germany,the rise in regular per capita credit marketdebt remained very limited. However, theoutsourcing of debt-ridden entities from corebudgets also played a role here.
5
At the same time, since the 1990s the volumeof cash advances, which are actually only in-tended to bridge short-term liquidity short-falls, included in total debt has risen from 31
billion to 335 billion (just under one-third of
local authorities’ total credit liabilities), reflect-ing their de facto use as a financing instru-
ment. As with the federal states, there aregreat differences in the debt levels of the indi-vidual local authorities, ranging from thosewith no credit liabilities to those in consider-able financial distress, whose respectivesupervisory bodies at state level have been at-tempting for many years to slow down debtgrowth by imposing tough budgetary restric-tions. While the differences in total per capitadebt are smaller than at state governmentlevel, the trend in cash advances demon-strates that in many cases strict budgetarylimits alone are insufficient. Overall, the shareof local government in the combined debt ofcentral, state and local government has nowfallen further to 6
1/C252%.Further debt-like burdens on public
finances
In addition to explicit credit liabilities, there
are other obligations, such as pension claimsand pension entitlements, for which noreserves have yet been formed. According topreliminary statistical calculations, the totalof such obligations incurred to date by thestatutory pension insurance scheme alone isaround three times the recorded level of gov-ernment debt.
6Unlike explicit debt, however,
these – in some cases extremely long-term –government obligations can be reduced sub-stantially through changes to benefits legis-lation, and the calculated volume dependsheavily on assumptions regarding life expect-ancy, pay trends and the discount factor,which occasionally need to be revised.

5In addition to the outsourcing of businesses in areas
such as waste management, special purpose associations
keeping commercial accounts were also removed from
the reporting group for the financial statistics. Analyses
of the local government tier have shown that around
one-half of all debts in the local authorities’ area of influ-
ence are not included (any more) in the narrower report-
ing sample (see, for example, M Junkernheinrich and
G Micosatt, Kommunaler Finanz- und Schuldenreport
Deutschland 2008, Bertelsmann-Stiftung; available in
German only). However, for those outsourced entities
that are market producers with independent accounting
and autonomy in their core business it would be inappro-
priate to include their liabilities in the calculation of gov-
ernment debt.

26Guarantees constitute contingent liabilities
and are another source of risks to publicfinances. However, only a small part of the3
1/C252trillion in outstanding guarantees is likely
to cause actual costs as the regulations forissuing such guarantees generally stipulatestrict criteria regarding the probability of theirbeing called. In addition, the commitmentfees, which usually have to be calculated inkeeping with market conditions, provide acontinuous source of earnings that offsetspossible costs in certain cases. Nonetheless, itcannot be ruled out that the guarantees forcredit institutions, which have been increasedsince 2008 in the course of the financial crisis,will lead on balance to noticeable budgetaryburdens, although it is not currently possibleto reliably estimate their size.Development of interest expenditure
Fluctuating budgetary burden arising
from interest expenditure
The sharp rise in government debt is reflected
in interest expenditure. A long-term compari-son using the national accounts definition ad-justed for methodological alterations shows asignificant increase in the share of interest inthe combined overall expenditure of central,state and local government. From just over3% in 1970, the interest burden climbed al-most continuously to nearly 10% in the mid-1980s. Following a temporary decline, therewas a renewed marked increase to almost12% in the mid-1990s in the wake of Ger-man unification. After a period of stabilisa-tion, a substantial decrease began in 1999and accelerated again last year. At just over8
1/C252%, the share of interest payments in total
expenditure even fell back somewhat belowthe level recorded in the late 1980s.
The differences in debt developments be-
tween central, state and local governmentare also reflected in their interest expenditure.The interest burden in the wake of Germanunification is particularly apparent in thebudget and special funds of central govern-ment. However, after reaching a high of 17%in 1995, the share of interest expenditure hasfallen almost continuously and, at just over10
1/C252% at last report, has returned to the
level recorded at the end of the 1980s.Nonetheless, the medium-term financial planadopted in the summer of 2009 forecaststhat, given high deficits, the interest burdenas defined in the government budget ac-Share of interest in

27counts will rise again very sharply to 161/C252%
by 2013. For state government as a whole,the eastern German states’ virtually debt-freestart led to a marked decrease in the interestburden at the beginning of the 1990s. How-ever, the continued strong overall growth incredit liabilities led to a renewed rise in theinterest burden to just under 7
1/C252% in 2006,
which was followed by a decline. By contrast,local government has seen a clear decrease inits share of interest expenditure since theearly 1980s. At 2
1/C252% at last report, it had
even fallen to less than two-fifths the size ofthe peak recorded in 1982.
Steep decline in average interest rate
since German unification
The interest expenditure burden depends crit-
ically on both the extent of indebtedness andthe average interest rate. The latter can beestimated using data from the nationalaccounts. The annual interest expenditure isplaced in relation to indebtedness, using themean of the value for the end of the yearunder review and the end of the precedingyear to approximate the actual loans onwhich interest was due. From 1970 to 1990,this average interest rate fluctuated around7%. The interest expenditure ratio thus tend-ed to follow the growing debt ratio in thisperiod. While the debt ratio continued to in-crease significantly in the subsequent yearsup to 2009, in the same period interest ex-penditure in relation to GDP , starting fromjust over 3%, first experienced a moderaterise but then fell to just over 2
1/C252%. The aver-
age interest rate thus decreased substantially,declining almost continuously from 8% in1992 to 4
1/C254% in the period 2005-08. There
was a further clear reduction to 33/C254% last
year, meaning that the average interest ratehad halved since the unification of Germany.Where this decline reflects lower inflation oroccurs amidst decreasing real GDP growthrates, the falling interest expenditure is notassociated with a real reduction of the burden(see also the box on pages 18 and 19).
The calculated average interest rate hinges
on a number of determinants that, for themost part, cannot be controlled in the shortterm. Changes generally only occur in con-nection with refinancing, when the debt levelis expanded or when floating rate debt instru-ments are used. Changes in interest rate con-ditions are therefore only reflected fully inAverage interest rate,

Capital market ratesThe average interest rate paid on German
government debt depends, in particular, onthe capital market rates in the euro area. Thelatter are affected, among other things, byboth global and specific endogenous macro-economic developments and by inflation ex-pectations. With regard to the respectivedebt instruments, particular account mustalso be taken of liquidity and default risk pre-miums. The better the secondary market per-forms, the lower the liquidity premiums willbe. The size of a default risk premium de-pends on the issuer’s solvency rating. To date,Germany has benefited from very low defaultrisk and liquidity premiums and forms the
euro-area point of reference for yields onother countries’ ten-year government bonds.At the height of the financial and economiccrisis in the spring of 2009, however, the costof credit default swaps, which can be takenas a measure of default risk, temporarilyreached almost 1%, even for German govern-ment bonds. Although it has since fallen backby around two-thirds, it remains clearly abovethe pre-crisis level.
A comparison of the interest rates on ten-
year German Federal bonds (Bunds) issuedevery January since the late 1970s can beused, as a central government example, todemonstrate the extent of the decline in cap-ital market rates. In addition to cyclical andinflation-driven fluctuations, a strong down-ward trend can be identified. In 2010, a newlow of 3
1/C254% was recorded. This constitutes a
reduction of two-thirds from the peak of9
3/C254% reached in January 1982 and of nearly
one-half from the mean value of 6%.
Maturity structureAlongside the general interest rate level, the
yield curve and the maturity structure of bor-rowing are also key determinants of the sizeof interest expenditure. As a rule, the yieldcurve slopes upward, meaning that debt con-tracts with longer maturities have higherinterest rates than short-term debt instru-ments – above all owing to the greater uncer-tainty associated with the former. However,they provide the government with greaterplanning certainty, and the issue yields areInterest rate on January

29subject to markedly lower cyclical fluctu-
ations.
Looking at the structure of central govern-
ment debt, there is quite a firm focus on thelong-term range, in which bonds are general-ly issued with maturities of 10 or 30 years.Since 2000, such instruments have accountedfor just over 55% of central governmentdebt. Although the share of five-year Federalnotes (Bobls) has been declining since 2006,it still makes up just over one-sixth. The shareof two-year Federal Treasury notes (Sch/C228tze)has increased slightly to just over one-tenth.More striking is the development of FederalTreasury discount paper (Bubills; introduced in1996) and Federal Treasury financing paper,both of which usually have significantly short-er maturities. After gradually increasing tonearly 5%, their share soared to 10% in 2009.
The average residual maturity has risen from
just over 5
1/C252years in 1999 to just over 6 years
at last report owing primarily to the increaseduse of thirty-year Federal bonds (Bunds).However, this figure has a limited informativevalue with regard to average interest ratesand the dependence of debt servicing onchanges in the more volatile short-term inter-est rates. For example, the average interestrates can fall while residual maturities remainvirtually unchanged if the share of issues withvery long and very short maturities simul-taneously increases, since the yield curve isoften significantly flatter when maturities arevery long. Unlike some federal states, for anumber of years now central government hasnot used the option of indexing the rate oninstruments with long maturities to a moneymarket rate upon issue in order to shorten
the interest rate lock-in period. Nonetheless,there has recently been a greater overall de-pendence on short-term interest rates owing,in particular, to the clear increase in Bubills.
Other determinants of interest
expenditure
Borrowing in a foreign currency means that
the debt level and interest payments are de-pendent on exchange rate developments. Toavoid the risks associated with this depend-ence, contractual protection against changesin the exchange rate is needed. Given thesame interest rate lock-in period, it would ap-pear difficult to achieve notable cost savings– the calculation of which would also need toinclude counterparty risks arising from ex-Central government

30change rate hedging transactions – through
such borrowing. Consequently, there was along period in which central government didnot place any foreign currency securities. Itwas not until 2005 that central governmentstarted to do so again, issuing two bondswith a total volume of US$9 billion; their ma-turities – until 2010 and 2012 – were relative-ly limited.
Interest flows can generally be modified
through the conclusion of supplementaryagreements. For example, long-term fixedinterest rates can, in effect, be converted intovariable rates using swaps. The associated ex-penditure is estimated together with theinterest payments for the underlying instru-ments in the central government budget andtherefore cannot be derived from the pub-lished budgetary figures. Every year since
2004, the Budget Acts have containedauthorisations to conclude such agreementsto the sum of 380 billion. According to the
debt report by the Federal Ministry of Fi-nance, the scope for authorisations in 2008had been virtually exhausted by the end ofthe year, with a take-up of 374 billion. As
little of the data on these transactions ismade public, an information gap remains.The data reported to the Commission underthe EU excessive deficit procedure reveal thatthe net interest income from derivatives hasbeen positive on average since 2002, which,with a normal yield curve, is consistent withthe shortening of maturities using swapsrecorded in central government debt reportsin aggregated form only. Precise data are notavailable for state and local government,either. However, large burdens resulting fromtransactions with derivative instruments havebeen reported in some local authorities. All inall, the question arises as to whether therisks, lack of transparency and monitoringproblems associated with using derivatives donot ultimately outweigh any possible savingsfor the government.
In addition, interest expenditure can be af-
fected by premiums or discounts when debtinstruments are issued. In the budgets, dis-counts arising when securities are issued witha coupon below the market interest rate arebooked as current interest expenditure, whilepremiums are deducted from it. The – some-times inevitable – costs or cost savings of sub-sequent periods are thus recorded as dis-counted counterentries in the current budget.For securities with longer maturities, this can

31give rise to sizeable sums, obscuring actual
interest expenditure. In the past few years,this effect has occasionally played a more sig-nificant role owing, among other things, todeclining interest rates. However, the budget-ary estimates were generally cautious. Forexample, while a burden of 31 billion arising
from discounts was forecast in the 2009 cen-tral government budget, premiums of 31 bil-
lion, or 2
1/C252% of total interest expenditure,
were ultimately received.
Finally, inflation-indexed interest and redemp-
tion payments can also be agreed. They offerinvestors protection against the risk of unex-pected price rises – restricted by investmentincome taxation, which is determined by thenominal interest rate. With an issue volumeof330 billion, however, such Federal bonds
(Bunds) and Federal notes (Bobls) currentlymake only a relatively limited contribution.

Outlook and fiscal policy implications
In recent decades, the debt ratio has risen
dramatically. Nonetheless, in the past fewyears the resulting expenditure pressurewould seem, at first sight, to have been morethan offset by the clear fall in the averageinterest rate. Interest expenditure in relationto GDP has thus declined on balance. If theaverage interest rate had remained at thelevel recorded in 1992, this would have re-sulted in additional expenditure of 370 bil-
lion, or almost 3% of GDP .
However, cost savings accrued through a de-
crease in the average interest rate must notsimply be interpreted as fiscal policy leeway. If
nominal GDP growth rates fall in parallel withthe average interest rate on governmentdebt, the interest expenditure savings mustbe used to reduce deficits in order to stabilisethe debt ratio (for more details, see the boxon pages 18 and 19).
9If, in a period of de-
creasing inflation and declining output growth,nominal GDP growth falls faster than averageinterest rates (owing to the gradual adjust-ment of borrowing conditions), the refinan-cing savings will actually be insufficient to sta-bilise the debt ratio. Without additional con-solidation measures, burdens would thus bedeferred to the future. In Germany, there has,in fact, been an upward trend in the interest-growth differential over the past three dec-ades. The adjustment of primary balanceswas not sufficient to stabilise the debt ratio,which was, at times, also driven up by effectsthat have no impact on deficits. Indeed, thegap between the actual primary surplus andthat required to stabilise the debt ratio haswidened even further in recent decades, andthe debt ratio has therefore climbed signifi-cantly.
To reverse the debt trend of the past few
decades, the German budgetary rules for
8However, the booking of the related interest expend-
iture in the central government budget has led to erratic
fluctuations. Since 2009, provisions have been made for
the extra sums related to future final payments of
inflation-indexed debt instruments issued since 2006. A
transfer of 311/C252billion, equivalent to 4% of interest pay-
ments, was used also to offset the burdens accumulated
in the years from 2006 to 2008. Despite moderate infla-
tion expectations, additional provisions of 31/C252billion
were made in the 2010 budget.

32central and state government stipulate that,
in future, they must achieve at least close-to-balance budgets in structural terms.
10With
fixed limits on new borrowing, changes ininterest expenditure directly affect fiscal pol-icy leeway. Refinancing savings can be ex-pected to decline markedly from their recentsubstantial level in the coming years. If inter-est rates rise again perceptibly from their cur-rent very low level, additional costs couldeven be incurred.
The high indebtedness alone means that the
sensitivity of public finances to interest ratechanges is considerable and will increasefurther in the coming years. Even with debtat the level recorded at the end of 2009(31.7 trillion), a rise of one percentage point
in the average interest rate will already resultin additional spending of 317 billion per year.
Although interest rate lock-in periods meanthat current interest developments are onlyfully reflected in interest costs with a lag, theshort-term effects are already being felt.Owing to the substantial volume of debt in-struments with initial maturities of less thanone year and of variable rate liabilities, a riseof one percentage point in the short-terminterest rate is likely to lead to a relativelyrapid increase of 32 billion in government
interest expenditure.
11Given a general gov-
ernment refinancing volume of nearly 3200
billion in fixed rate debt instruments withoriginal maturities of more than one year, anincrease of one percentage point in longer-term interest rates would also lead to add-itional costs of 32 billion in the following
year, which would subsequently continue torise. This would be accompanied by higherspending on foreseeable additional net bor-
rowing. Given a volume of over 3140 billion
– the amount estimated by the German Fi-nancial Planning Council for 2010 – such aninterest rate rise alone would lead to add-itional expenditure from 2011 onward of al-most 31
1/C252billion vis-/C224-vis the conditions cur-
rently possible. Given persistently high def-icits, these costs would rapidly increase.
All in all, sharply rising debt ratios and the
foreseeable burdens on future budgets owingto the demographic trend mean that exten-sive consolidation is needed to ensure sus-tainable public finances and compliance withnational and international obligations. Dimin-ishing confidence in the sustainability of pub-lic finances has grave consequences, such ashigher financing costs due to rising risk pre-miums and macroeconomic burdens causedby an overall increase in interest rates. Suchdevelopments can currently be observed inseveral countries. Sound public finances alsoplay a central role in anchoring inflation ex-pectations at an appropriate level as part of astability-oriented monetary policy. It is there-fore particularly important that the euro-areamember states comply with the European fis-cal rules. As an anchor of stability, Germanyhas a key role to play with regard to the im-plementation of European rules. The newnational debt rule can, if consistently applied

35Emerging markets in
the financial crisis: the
effect of cross-border
bank loansAt the latest with the collapse of
Lehman Brothers in September 2008,the financial and economic crisisspread to the emerging market econo-mies (EMEs). International bank loansplayed a significant part in transmit-ting the crisis from the industrialisedcountries. Moreover, this had alreadybeen the case in earlier periods of cri-sis. This article makes clear that a risein global risk aversion, pressure amongbanks of the lender countries to con-solidate, a weak macroeconomic andfinancial situation in the emergingmarkets and a low level of monetaryand financial integration are majorfactors in explaining the decline incross-border banking activities. Beyondthe statistical significance, this articleexamines the economic relevance ofthese factors in different crisis periods.As a result, it is shown that in the cur-rent crisis global factors were mainlyresponsible for transmitting the finan-cial shock. Nevertheless, significant re-gional differences may also be identi-fied among the EMEs. For instance,the countries of central and easternEurope posted smaller outflows ofcross-border bank loans than otherEMEs. This can primarily be explainedby their close monetary and financialintegration with the euro area.

36Spillover of the financial and economic
crisis to the emerging markets
At the beginning of the financial and eco-
nomic crisis, the industrialised countries inparticular were hard hit by the financialmarket upheavals. After Lehman Brotherscollapsed in September 2008, however,financial stress in the emerging marketsintensified. The crisis was most acute in thefourth quarter of 2008/first quarter of 2009,when the problems in the financial marketsspread to the real economy and, faced withthe heavy slump in world trade, most emer-ging markets saw their economic output fallsharply for the first time since the Asian crisisof 1997-98.
International banks are important investors in
the EMEs. It is therefore not surprising thatbank loans from industrialised countries toemerging markets are also an importanttransmission channel of financial turmoil.
1
A comprehensive empirical analysis of thedeterminants of cross-border bank lending isof particular interest for a number of reasons.First of all, it can provide general insights intohow financial crises spread and why emer-ging markets are affected by “financialstress” to a different extent. Such an investi-gation lies at the centre of this article.
2
This is of importance not only from the bor-rower countries’ viewpoint. Gaining moreinsightful information on the key determinantsof cross-border bank claims and on the impactof financial stress periods is also of relevanceto the financial stability of the industrialisedcountries given the possible negative feedbackloop. Not least of all, this is also true of euro-
area banks, many of which lent substantialvolumes to the emerging markets of Asia,Latin America and, in particular, central andeastern Europe. Moreover, extensive ties oftenexist also as a result of direct investment rela-tionships with the observed economies.

International bank lending from industrialisedcountries to emerging markets rose sharply
1See International Monetary Fund, World Economic Out-
look, April 2009. In the earlier literature on the transmis-
sion of financial crises the focus was placed primarily on
the influence of joint trade relations. See R Glick and
AK Rose (1998), International Financial Contagion, World
Economic Outlook, Chapter 3, pp 66-87. In later works,
the transmission of crises was increasingly seen to be
driven by financial linkages. See G Kaminski and
CM Reinhart (2000), On Crisis, Contagion and Confu-
sion, Journal of International Economics, 51, pp 145-
168.
2This analysis examines banks’ cross-border positions
and bank loans from 17 industrialised countries to 28
emerging markets in the three regions Asia, central and
eastern Europe and Latin America to identify important
determinants. The EMEs are located in Asia (China, India,
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, South Korea, Tai-
wan, Thailand and Vietnam), central and eastern Europe
(Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary,
Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia
and Turkey) and Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile,
Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela). The industrial-
ised countries included in the study are Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan,
the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland,
the United Kingdom and the United States.
3The data on which the following sections and the em-
pirical study are based are provided by the Bank for Inter-
national Settlements (BIS). The total international bank
assets include cross-border loans as well as other external
positions such as, for example, holdings of bonds, money
market instruments and equities which were issued by
banks and non-banks in the emerging market economy.
Among the countries observed, cross-border bank loans
predominate, however. For this reason, the terms cross-
border bank loans, claims, external positions and foreign
assets are used synonymously.Though

37over the past 20 years, with loans to the
group of countries observed here rising morethan threefold since the beginning of the1990s. This is equivalent to an average in-crease of 9% per year. To a considerableextent, this increase was driven by loans tothe central and east European economies,where the annual increase – starting from alow level – averaged 16%. By comparison,the growth rates in Asia and Latin Americawere, at 10% and 4%, respectively, consider-ably more moderate. Overall, in September2009, banks from industrialised countriesheld assets in the observed emerging marketstotalling US$1,645 billion, including loans ofUS$1,206 billion.
4Roughly 40% of this total
amount was accounted for by the central andeast European economies. Measured in termsof economic strength, these bank exposureswere equivalent to almost half of the GDP ofthe observed EMEs.
The increase in bank loans from industrialised
countries to the emerging markets in theperiod under review was not constant, how-ever, but repeatedly experienced sharp fluctu-ations. However, financial crises were foundto have different effects on the direction andvolume of capital flows.
The Mexican crisis of 1994-95 had only a mod-
erate and temporary impact on cross-borderbank lending. Primarily the Latin Americaneconomies were affected by banks’ reluc-tance to extend new loans, although the cen-tral and east European countries, which wereundergoing an initial transition period duringCross-border bank assets vis-/C224-vis

38this time, were also impaired. For former
members of the Council for Mutual EconomicAssistance (COMECON), the switch from acentrally planned economy to a market-economy system brought substantial struc-tural change to the financial sectors in anycase, and made them extremely vulnerable toadditional exogenous disturbances.
The impact of the Asian crisis of 1997-98
(and of the Russian crisis, which immediatelyfollowed it) was far more pronounced andhampered lending in particular to Asianemerging markets. Thailand, Indonesia,Malaysia and the Philippines were the mostseverely affected economies. In individualquarters in the years 1997 to 1999, they evenexperienced a reduction in cross-border lend-ing. But Latin American countries – notablyBrazil and Argentina – were also hit, albeitwith a certain time lag, in particular due tothe default by Russia.
At the beginning of the new millennium, the
foreign assets of banks from the industrialisedcountries held in the emerging markets ofcentral and eastern Europe and of Asiarose appreciably. Here, too, Latin Americafollowed with a slight time lag. Far-reachingliberalisation measures, complex new finan-cial products and expectations of compara-tively high returns in a global environment oflow interest rates prompted internationalbanks to expand substantially their activitiesin the emerging markets, above all in centraland eastern Europe. Moreover, most of thelatter countries profited from their admissionto the European Union. Between mid-2007and mid-2008, capital inflows to the respect-
ive regions reached all-time highs.
These massive capital inflows as a result of
bank loans – in central and eastern Europe,figures of more than 10% of GDP were post-ed – were in some cases far too high to beabsorbed. Thus, they contributed to over-heating in some economies. In addition, thecurrent account positions of some countriesproved to be unsustainable.
The dynamic inflows of funds to the EMEs
started to abate in the final quarter of 2008.At that time, tensions in the internationalmoney and credit markets were turning intoa global confidence crisis. Large internationalbanks started to cut back their cross-borderassets significantly across the board. Al-though this was true, primarily, of claims onborrowers in other industrialised countries,the emerging markets were affected as well.This trend persisted in the fourth quarter of2008 and at the beginning of 2009 as claimson the non-banking sector plummeted. Yetthere were also interesting regional differ-ences in this general “sudden stop” environ-ment. At least in the short term, cross-bordercapital flows to countries with a large shareof foreign banks – particularly in central andeastern Europe – were found to be morestable during this time.
5However, this did not
prevent the abrupt adjustment of the macro-economic imbalances, which had grown be-fore the crisis and were suddenly revealed by

40it, from triggering a massive slump in the real
economy in many of these countries.
The cut-back in assets by international lend-
ers decelerated in the second quarter of2009, however, and as a result of the nascentreal economic recovery signs emerged thatcross-border flows of funds to the emergingmarkets were stabilising. The economies ofAsia and Latin America recorded inflowsagain as from mid-2009.
6
However, cross-border lending by banks fromindustrialised countries to the emerging mar-kets recovered at only a moderate pace, notleast because international banks were stillreducing their balance sheets. In contrast,portfolio shifts by international investors arethe main reason that overall capital flows tothe EMEs have already risen markedly again.Besides the improving growth prospects
7and
rising yield differentials, growing risk appetiteamong international investors is also likely tohave contributed to the considerable increasein equity buying, for example, above all in thebig emerging markets of Latin America andAsia such as Brazil, China and India.
8Overall,
therefore, the volatility of cross-border capitalflows appears to be increasing, ie large out-flows are very quickly being compensated bysizeable inflows. This represents a major chal-lenge for economic policy and for the flexibil-ity of the financial markets in the economiesin question.Cross-border bank loans to EMEs: an
empirical analysis of the driving factors
The description of how cross-border bank
loans from industrial economies to the emer-ging markets have developed in recent yearsis supplemented in the following by an empir-ical analysis of the main drivers of this devel-opment. The analysis focuses on the questionas to what factors in times of crisis are closelylinked to the transmission of financial shocksvia the bank lending channel from industrial-ised countries to the EMEs.
Thus, given that indicators which are intend-
ed to represent financial stress are explicitlytaken into account, identifying determinantsof cross-border bilateral bank lending goesbeyond the traditional push and pull factors,
9
which largely use macroeconomic fundamen-tals in the lender and borrower countries as
6The slight delay in the recovery of capital flows to the
European emerging markets is probably due to the fact
that Latin America and Asia are driving the economic up-
swing. By contrast, after a comparatively pronounced
slump in real economic activity in the new EU member
countries, the upswing has been slower to unfold.
7Growth in the emerging markets is expected to be at
least 6% in 2010-11 after a moderate 2% in 2009. See
International Monetary Fund (2010), World Economic
Outlook, Update January 2010.
8In some economies, portfolio flows grew so vigorously
during 2009 that risks of a renewed overheating are
being discussed. In response, some countries are con-
sidering measures to dampen capital flows while others
have already taken action. See J Ostry, A Gosh, K Haber-

41explanatory factors. Instead, the study con-
centrates in particular on the impact of finan-cial stress and examines whether and to whatextent global risk variables, as well as finan-cial stress factors in the lender and borrowercountries, constitute key determinants ofcross-border bank claims.
10
The findings of the empirical studies confirmon the one hand the significance of thechosen approach using a gravity model. Thus,the distance between the two economiesplays an important role in explaining bilateralcredit flows.
Where there is a substantial distance between
lender and borrower, bilateral lending vol-umes to the EMEs decrease significantly. Geo-graphical distance – or factors such as culturaldistance, which are probably implicitly takeninto account through this variable – is there-fore still of relevance to volumes of cross-border assets, regardless of the tremendousprogress made in communication and infor-mation technology.
11Differences in income
between the lender and borrower countryalso have a significant effect on bilateral lend-ing. As expected, a larger home market in theborrower country boosts the volume of loansgranted by industrialised economies, whereasthe empirical link to income in the lendercountry – contrary to the positive correlationnormally expected in gravity models – provesnegative. One reason for this could be thatfinancial centres cancel out the expectedpositive link between the size of the lendercountry and the volume of cross-borderassets.
12Moreover, cross-border loans react in themanner expected to relative differences ininterest rates and growth between industrial-ised economies and the EMEs, in that higherinterest and growth rates in the borrowercountries imply larger inflows of cross-borderbank loans.
Besides the standard variables of the gravity
model, the financial stress and risk indicatorsalso prove to be significant determinants ofcross-border bank lending. Both global andcountry-specific factors in the lender andborrower countries affect the transmission offinancial stress.
For example, a deteriorating sentiment in the
international financial markets – in the shapeof greater risk aversion on the part of inter-national investors and higher expected short-

not taken into account in the model, such as cultural dif-

42Deutsche BundesbankThe impact of financial tensions on bank lending to selected countries: an empirical analysis
This empirical study1on the impact of financial risk indicators on
cross-border bank flows is based on a panel of 17 industrialisedeconomies with exposures to 28 countries in the three regionscentral and eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America. The periodunder review runs from the first quarter of 1993 to the fourthquarter of 2008. Referring to a gravity model, bilateral loansfrom industrialised economies to the countries under observa-tion are estimated by standard variables used in the gravity ap-proach as well as by financial risk measures in the lender andborrower countries and at global level. The underlying regres-sion equation for the “Basic model” reads

In order to study what specific channels contribute to spillover
effects in emerging market economies, four models focusing onfinancial risk indicators
5were additionally specified.
The “Global model” is based on the idea that global influences
are the main determinants of cross-border bank flows. Besidesthe standard variables used in the gravity model, the ChicagoBoard Options Exchange S&P 100 Volatility Index (VIX) and theaverage yield spread between US corporate and governmentbonds (RISK_AVERSION) are included. Both these indicators areproxies for the state of the global financial markets; while theVIXis considered a measure of market players’ uncertainty, the
yield spread reflects international investors’ risk aversion.
6Great-
er uncertainty and pronounced risk aversion can be expected tolower bank lending.
The “Lender model” assumes that the industrialised economy’s
financial characteristics have a significant influence on cross-border bank positions. According to Krugman (2008), thebalance sheets of international financial intermediaries are animportant source of spillover effects. This paper concentrates onthe “common lender” effect, which takes into account the factthat financial stress in a creditor country is determined by that
country’s exposure to the primary crisis country.
7The indicator is
measured as the sum of the external assets BIS reporting countryiholds vis-/C224-vis the primary crisis country (or crisis countries) kin
relation to the sum of all external assets held by the countryunder review. Banks in industrialised economies with greaterexposure to the primary crisis country (or crisis countries) willpresumably be worse hit by the crisis and are therefore likely toreduce their positions vis-/C224-vis other countries, for example inorder to meet capital requirements and reduce risk exposures.
8
In addition, an indicator of the health of the lender country’sbanking sector is used, measured as the deviation of the bankingsector subindex from the overall equity index (BANK_HEALTH_LENDER). This is based on the hypothesis that a banking sectorthat underperforms the market as a whole – as measured by shareprices – might be under stress and is consequently forced to re-think its lending activities. If, say, banks in industrialised econ-omies are saddled with a large percentage of non-performingloans in their home market, the share price is likely to suffer,which could impair the level of their international positions inother countries.
The “Risk model” assumes that country-specific risk factors ren-
der an individual borrower country more vulnerable to the trans-mission of financial stress. Risk factors that are used in the senseof early-warning indicators include the ratio of the general gov-ernment balance to GDP (GOV_BALANCE). A larger fiscal deficitgoes hand in hand with a higher probability of future default.Consequently, the variable should implicitly also take into ac-count differences in country risk. As in the “Lender model”, anindicator of banks’ health in the borrower country j(BANK_
HEALTH_BORROWER) is used as an additional country-specific in-dicator of risk. A stable banking sector in the borrower countryshould have a positive impact on the volume of loans granted.
The “Integration model” implies that the extent of international
financial and monetary integration between the lender and bor-rower countries influences the transfer of financial stress. In thiscontext, the estimate takes into consideration an indicator ofbilateral financial linkages (FINANCE_OPEN), measured as theratio of all banks’ outstanding assets and liabilities in country i
vis-/C224-vis country jrelative to the GDP of country j. In addition,
the empirical approach controls for the exchange rate regimeER_REGIME based on the Reinhart-Rogoff classification (2004).
9
One would expect a higher degree of financial integration andmore fixed exchange rate regimes to induce a greater flow ofcredit. On the other hand, a decline in integration in times ofcrisis would also be accompanied by a greater outflow of funds.

Markets – New Empirical Evidence on the Spread of Financial Crises,
BIS Working Paper, forthcoming. — 2The data are taken from the
Locational Banking Statistics published by the Bank for International
Settlements (BIS). The external positions include cross-border loans as
well as other foreign assets such as, for instance, holdings of bonds,
money market instruments and shares issued by banks and non-banks
in country j. As international bank loans predominate among the
countries under review, the terms cross-border bank loans, external
positions and foreign assets are used synonymously. — 3Exchange
rate adjusted changes in positions may assume negative values if
country jrepays more old loans to country iin a given quarter than itreceives new loans. Following E Papaioannou (2008), What Drives

negative sign. — 4All variables are logarithms, with only interest rate
and growth differentials and exchange rate changes given in percent-

are not entirely independent of one another. The explanatory power

determination. — 6Actual default risk is also a factor here. — 7Three

43The five models are estimated using a random effects model.10
The results of the five specifications are shown in the table
above.
As anticipated, a smaller distance between lender and borrower,
a larger home market in the catching-up economy, a greaterinterest rate and growth differential in favour of the borrowercountry and an appreciation of the emerging market currencyhave a beneficial impact on cross-border lending by industrial-ised economies. Contrary to the assumptions made in the gravityapproach, the size of the domestic market in the lender countryis negatively correlated with the volume of loans granted. Onereason could be that important banking groups are not always
based in the largest economies by GDP.
11
As regards the influence of financial turmoil, it can be shownthat industrialised economies reduce their cross-border bankloans in times of crisis if they reassess the global risk or if theirbanking sector is itself exposed to the primary crisis country.Moreover, a deterioration in the macroeconomic and financialsituation in borrower countries will contribute to the decline inloans from industrialised economies. A lower degree of mon-etary and financial integration will also negatively influence cap-ital flows to emerging markets.
Mexico was the primary crisis country; the Asian crisis (1997-98), with
Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea and Thailand as the pri-
mary crisis countries; and the current financial and economic crisis in
which the United States is the primary crisis country. — 8CR i j c k e g h e m

44term market volatility – has a dampening
effect on cross-border bilateral lending byindustrialised countries. In this context, theVIX volatility index for the US equity marketand yield differentials between US corporateand government bonds serve as global riskindicators.
Moreover, the characteristics of the lender
country have a major bearing on its banks’cross-border activities in times of crisis. The
more the group of lenders itself is affected bythe consequences of the financial and eco-nomic crisis, the less able it is to continuegranting cross-border loans to EMEs (the so-called common lender effect). Thus, thefinancial distress within a group of countriesaffects third countries as well. This effectplayed a major role in the latest crisis. At first,the financial crisis hit primarily the group ofindustrialised countries, and the underlyingempirical studies confirm that the financialstress suffered by the banking sectors in thesecountries had an adverse impact on lendingto the EMEs.
Empirical studies also support the assumption
that individual risk factors in the borrowercountry dampen bilateral lending. For in-stance, a difficult public finances situation inthe borrower country – for example, a highpublic deficit – is detrimental to the assess-ment of the potential borrower. In much thesame way, difficulties experienced in theborrower country’s banking sector changethe investor’s perception of risk and reducethe EME’s ability to attract external fundingfrom industrialised countries.
Furthermore, the extent of financial and mon-
etary integration between lender and bor-rower country determines whether and howstrongly contagion effects impact on inter-national lending relationships. It has beenfound that closer bilateral financial integra-tion is positively correlated with the volumeof new bank loans. It can therefore be as-sumed that a higher initial level of financialinteraction between lender and borrower hasContribution by the five

45a positive effect on future transactions. This
implies a certain persistence of lending rela-tionships. By the same token, however, adecline in financial integration in times of cri-sis could have a negative impact on capitalflows to emerging markets in the longerterm.
13Nor is this countered by the fact that
capital flows to the EMEs have made an un-expectedly fast recovery in the current crisis,as other factors such as a marked decline inrisk aversion on the part of investors mayhave played a major part in this development.
The exchange rate regime in place in the bor-
rower country also has a significant effect onbilateral lending. It may be observed thatmore flexible exchange rate regimes are ac-companied by a greater withdrawal of loansin times of crisis. However, this does notimply that fixed exchange rate regimes areautomatic stabilisers in each and every case.Rather, it cannot be ruled out that fixed ex-change rate regimes such as those in theEMEs of central and eastern Europe contrib-uted to substantial internal and external im-balances in the run-up to the crisis. Empiricalstudies point to a link between an exchangerate peg and financial distortions such as ex-cessive credit growth,
14pronounced current
account deficits and high foreign debt.15It is
possible that these factors amplified the im-pact of the crisis on the real economy
16and
indirectly even made the countries in questionmore vulnerable to the withdrawal of finan-cial resources as a result of general uncer-tainty in the financial markets.
17What influence do crisis-drivendevelopments in the financial marketshave on cross-border bank loans?
Over and above the impact of general deter-
minants on the development of cross-borderbanking flows, it is interesting to calculatethe relative contributions of the indicatorsexamined to the estimated bilateral bankingflows. This can be done by means of a contri-bution analysis.
18Having examined their stat-
istical significance, therefore, this article nowfocuses on the economic relevance of thevariables used in the model.
13See S Claessens, G Dell´Ariccia, D Igan and L Laeven,
Lessons and Policy Implications from the Global Financial
Crisis, Working Paper 44, International Monetary Fund.
14This is also seen as a cause of later banking crises, par-
ticularly in connection with excesses on the equity mar-
ket. See D Gerdesmeier, H-E Reimers and B Roffia (2009),
Asset Price Misalignments and the Role of Money and
Credit, Working Paper 1068, European Central Bank.
15AR Gosh, JD Ostry and C Tsangarides (2010), Ex-
change Rate Regimes and the Stability of the Internation-
al Monetary System, Working Paper, International Mon-
etary Fund, forthcoming. The authors point out that fixed
exchange rates delay the adjustment of external imbal-
ances and increase the risk of a financial crisis.
16There is no evidence of the exchange rate regime hav-
ing a direct impact on the amount of the growth losses in
the wake of the crisis. However, empirical studies reveal a
link between excessive credit growth, pronounced cur-
rent account deficits and high foreign debt and the impli-
cations of the crisis for the real economy. See P Berkmen,
G Gelos, R Rennhack and JP Walsh (2009), The Global
Crisis: Explaining Cross-Country Differences in the Output
Impact, Working Paper 280, International Monetary
Fund. Nor can it be ruled out that the imbalances that
existed in the new EU member states before the crisis are
to blame for the fact that the upswing in Europe is un-
folding with a time lag compared with the other emer-
ging market regions.
17A large share of foreign bank loans in proportion to
the total inflow of capital – this, too, might be the result
of the fixed exchange rate regime – may also heighten
the risk of insolvency. See H Tong and SJ Wei (2010), The
Composition Matters: Capital Inflows and Liquidity

46In the context of the chosen approach to ex-
plaining developments in cross-border capitalflows, it becomes clear how global and coun-try-specific stress factors affecting the lenderand borrower countries are to be assessed interms of their respective contribution to thedevelopment of cross-border loans in certainfinancial stress periods. In this way, insightscan be gained into the factors through whichfinancial stress is transmitted by way of inter-national bank loans, and the main deter-minants in each individual crisis period can beidentified.
In the current financial and economic crisis,
global factors have been identified as themain drivers of a withdrawal of bank fundsfrom the observed countries. The dramaticrise in global risk aversion and in the expectedshort-term financial market volatility waslargely responsible for the reluctance to lendto EMEs over the last two years. Over andabove these factors, the only relevant contri-bution resulted from a deterioration of therisk factors in the emerging markets them-selves. In this, the increasingly unfavourabledevelopment of the banking sectors in theEMEs during the course of the crisis played adecisive part.
Global factors also made the biggest contri-
bution to the retrenchment in cross-borderloans during the Asian crisis, although notnearly to the extent observed in the mostrecent period of crisis. Moreover, at that timetwo other factors drove deleveraging in theemerging markets. First, the decline in lend-ing flows was caused by falling growth ratesin the borrower countries compared with theeconomic developments in the lender coun-
tries. Second, the industrialised countries’lending flows were dampened by deteriorat-ing financial indicators in the EMEs, ie risingpublic deficits and growing tensions in thebanking sectors of central and easternEurope, Asia and Latin America.
By contrast, the deteriorating global senti-
ment played a more subordinate role in theMexican crisis. This seems entirely plausible asthe crisis was limited to one region. Thedeterioration of the country-specific risk indi-cators in the countries examined, notablyLatin America, were primarily responsible forthe decline in banks’ cross-border positions.Overall, however, the outflow of credit wasnot as dramatic as that witnessed in the cur-rent financial and economic crisis or, in aweaker form, during the Asian crisis. Thesound condition of the lender countrieswhich were not primary crisis countries them-selves was a key reason why, among otherthings, the cross-border exposure volumes tothe emerging markets as a whole could large-ly be sustained during this period.
During the current financial and economic cri-
sis, the central and east European economiesposted a more modest outflow of loans thanthe emerging markets of Asia and LatinAmerica. If one considers the effect of thevariables examined on the volume of inter-national bank loans in the current crisis andcompares the three regions, several factorsseem to have contributed to this divergingdevelopment.

47On the one hand, the more stable banking
sectors in the central and east Europeaneconomies had a positive impact on the vol-ume of loans granted. Among other things,this could be explained by the high foreignbank penetration in the region, which exped-ited the efficiency and stability of the bankingsectors there and was reflected, also in timesof crisis, in comparatively robust lendingvolumes from the industrialised countries.
In addition, it may be assumed, however, that
the large number of support measures byEuropean and international organisations alsoplayed a major role in stabilising the centraland east European banking sectors. Specialmention should be made here of the consid-erable financial assistance given to a numberof countries in the shape of InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) stand-by arrangementsas well as by the EU and the World Bank.
19
An, on the whole, stabilising effect was prob-ably also achieved by the “Vienna Initiative”,by which the European Commission, theInternational Monetary Fund, the EuropeanBank for Reconstruction and Development,the European Investment Bank, the WorldBank as well as large European banks withbranches in the new EU member countries atthe beginning of 2009 together agreed toprovide the central and east European econ-omies with international support.
Last but not least, the strong financial market
integration and the high degree of monetarylinkage of the European economies observedprobably also impacted positively on inflowsof cross-border bank loans, ie they stabilisedinternational lending to a greater extent in
Europe than in Asia and Latin America.
20
The fact that cross-border bank loans fromthe industrialised countries to central andeastern Europe were retrenched to a lesserextent than those to Asia and Latin Americadoes not imply, however, that the new EUcountries as a whole were less severely affect-ed by the financial and economic crisis thanthe observed Asian or Latin American EMEs.On the contrary, some of the economies incentral and eastern Europe suffered particu-larly pronounced declines in income. Thisillustrates that this analysis deals with only avery specific aspect in connection with thefinancial and economic crisis. Even with re-gard to capital flows, one must bear in mindthat the cross-border bank loans observedrepresent only a part of aggregate inter-
19In November 2008, a support package was approved
for Hungary totalling roughly US$26.2 billion that con-
sists of an IMF stand-by arrangement in the amount of
US$16.5 billion, EU assistance of US$8.4 billion and
US$1.3 billion from the World Bank. Roughly 70% of the
IMF funds have been disbursed to date. In December
2008, Latvia was awarded a financial aid package total-
ling US$10.6 billion, of which US$2.4 billion was granted
in the form of a stand-by arrangement, US$4.4 billion by
the EU and US$0.6 billion by the World Bank. So far,
roughly 35% of the funds under the stand-by arrange-
ment have been made available. Since May 2009, Ro-
mania has received roughly US$6.9 billion from an overall
package of US$27.1 billion, of which US$6.6 billion is
being financed by the EU and US$1.3 billion by the
World Bank. The IMF has also approved support for Latin
American countries – for example, flexible credit lines
have been granted to Colombia (SDR 7.0 billion) and
Mexico (SDR 31.5 billion) – and Poland (SDR 13.7 billion).
However, none of the countries has made use of these
funds so far. Moreover, the ECB granted Hungary and
Poland access to euro liquidity under swap transactions
(see press releases of 16 October 2008 and 21 November
2008). The Federal Reserve provided Brazil, South Korea
and Mexico with dollar liquidity under swap transactions
(see press release of 29 October 2008).

German banks are important len ders amon g those 
countries whi ch report to the Bank for International 
Settlements (BI S). The development of German banks’ 
external positions therefore warrants further investi ga-
tion. The data are base d on the consoli date d external 
assets of German banks, in cluding their forei gn bran ches 
and su bsidiaries, as well as forei gn banks lo cate d in Ger-
many.1 Unlike the a ggregate d data colle cted by the BI S, 
whi ch un derlie empiri cal estimates, these data ena ble a 
detaile d break down by maturity an d bankin g group. It 
shoul d be note d, however, that the followin g descriptive 
analysis of external assets does not differentiate between 
supply an d deman d fa ctors.
Since autumn 2007, strains on the international ﬁ  nan cial 
markets have also affe cted the external assets of banks 
in Germany. Since as early as summer 2007, cross- border 
claims have sta gnate d on the back of a continuous 
increase over a num ber of years. Total assets vis-à-vis 
non-resi dents amounte d to rou ghly €3,500 billion at 
that time, two-thir ds of whi ch was attri buta ble to 
forei gn non- banks. Forei gn su bsidiaries an d bran ches of 
the German bankin g system – espe cially of lar ge banks 
– were, in July 2007, the prin ciple contri butors to the en d 
of the perio d of growth of cross- border assets due to the 
real estate crisis in the U SA. By contrast, domesti c insti-
tutions continue d to in crease their external assets, inter 
alia because they felt o bliged to support their trou bled 
forei gn spe cial purpose vehi cles or to transfer the assets 
of these entities to their own balan ce sheets.
Followin g the collapse of Lehman Brothers in autumn 
2008, the effe cts of the ﬁ  nan cial crisis were even more 
intensely felt in the bankin g sector in Germany, tri ggere d 
by the stron g rise in global risk aversion, the crisis of 
conﬁ dence amon gst banks an d the freeze on the money 
markets. Between O ctober 2008 an d De cem ber 2009, bankin g groups’ external assets fell by a quarter, with 
the drop in cross- border claims on forei gn banks bein g 
rou ghly e quivalent to that of non- banks.2 Credit institu-
tions’ positions vis-à-vis the U SA an d the Unite d Kin gdom 
alone fell by €248 billion an d €207 billion, respe ctively, in 
this perio d. The decrease in external assets was primarily 
due to the fall in loans, whereas the re duction in se curi-
ties hol dings, espe cially debt se curities, was consi dera bly 
less pronoun ced.
External assets vis-à-vis the sample of countries3 menti-
one d in the main text were likewise not unaffe cted by 
these developments; however, the re duction was more 
mo derate than the overall re duction in cross- border 
assets an d took hol d at a later sta ge. Followin g a decre-

a hi gh of €230 billion or approximately 7 % of banks’

from a German perspe ctive at least, seem to contra dict 
the common hypothesis that the sharp drop in growth

emer ging economies was cause d primarily by declinin g 
capital ﬂ  ows from in dustrialise d countries.
Tren ds in len ding to the Asian, central an d eastern 
European an d Latin Ameri can countries un der review 
reveal major differen ces between lar ge banks an d Lan-
desbanks. While lar ge banks have not expan ded their

payment defaults on su bprime loans in the U SA shot up 
from a very low level – Lan desbanks’ assets to emer ging 
markets continue d to grow consi dera bly until autumn 
2008. In central an d eastern European e conomies, Lan-
desbanks did not re duce their external assets until the 
end of 2009. The sale of a su bsidiary, whi ch operate d 
mainly in central an d eastern Europe, also playe d a role 
here.  
The developments o bserve d partly reﬂ  ect the different 
maturity stru ctures of assets, whi ch may stem from the 
different business plans of lar ge banks an d Lan desbanks 
in emer ging markets. At an avera ge of 44 %, the per-

onset of the ﬁ  nan cial crisis was twi ce as hi gh as that hel d 
by Lan desbanks, where external assets with a maturity 
of less than one year a ccounte d for just 22 % of all assets. 
Thus, lar ge banks were pro bably in a better position to 
rea ct quickly to the chan ge in con ditions; however, their hol dings of cross- border assets were also more volatile as 
a result. This was conﬁ rme d re cently when lar ge banks

Conclusion
After rising strongly in the previous years,
cross-border bank lending to the emergingmarkets declined substantially in the currentfinancial and economic crisis. The main rea-sons were greater uncertainty worldwide andhigher risk aversion on the part of the lendingbanks. However, a comparatively healthybanking sector, close monetary and financialintegration in Europe and external supportmeasures were responsible for the centraland east European countries experiencingless pronounced outflows of international
bank loans than emerging Asia and LatinAmerica.
Whereas emerging markets themselves can
scarcely influence the development of globaldeterminants in times of crisis, measurestaken by the borrower countries with a viewto improving their own fundamentals canhelp safeguard the flow of cross-borderfunds, even when financial markets arestrained. Ensuring fiscal sustainability is espe-cially important; and as a general principle, itis essential to take timely action to preventinternal and external imbalances from build-ing up.
21A large number of other factors also play a part in ex-
plaining why the crisis affects economies to a different
extent. See International Monetary Fund, Differential Im-
pact, Finance and Development, March 2010.
