5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Underlying trends
After becoming considerably more severe in
the winter half year 2008-09, the underlying
recessionary trend in the German economy
appears to have eased considerably at the be-
ginning of the second quarter. Although in-
dustrial orders picked up somewhat recently
from their very poor level in the first quarter,
a cyclical bottoming-out is not to be expected
before the middle of the year. The signs of
improvement from export demand are still
weak overall and domestic demand is suffer-
ing from the declining propensity to invest.
This is consistent with the fact that the cau-
tious upturn in industrial sentiment continues
to be sustained solely by the expectations
component, while the current business situ-
ation was being rated as very unfavourable
up to the end of the period under review.
According to the available indicators, private
consumption remains a stabilising factor. The
main reasons for this are the selective pur-
chasing incentives from the economic stimu-
lus packages, a price climate which is preserv-
ing purchasing power, and the comparatively
moderate reaction of the labour market so
far.
Industry
The pace of the decline in industrial output,
which has been rapid since the final quarter
of last year, eased perceptibly at the end of
the period under review. Seasonally adjusted
industrial output in April was 2.9% down on
the month; according to the revised figure,Easing of

6there had been a slight increase in March.
Nevertheless, the figure over the four quar-
ters was also affected by the fact that the
Easter holidays – which fell in April this year –
were used by many firms for extended
breaks, while it was chiefly the automotive in-
dustry which stepped up its production some-
what in March. Industrial output in April was
31/C252% down on the average of the first quar-
ter. At around 6%, manufacture of capital
goods was cut back very sharply, whereas the
decline in the intermediate and consumer
goods sectors was not so large at 21/C252% and
11/C252% respectively. Overall industrial output in
April was down by almost one-quarter on the
year.
While domestic sales of industrial goods have
stabilised recently, there was a further set-
back in export business in April. After sea-
sonal adjustment, the value of exported
goods showed a fall of 43/C254% on the month.
Imports, too, were cut back considerably
at the start of the second quarter. At 53/C254%,
the month-on-month decline in imports was
– albeit starting from a relatively low level –
even greater than that in exports. The trade
surplus remained virtually unchanged in sea-
sonally adjusted terms at 39 billion.
Seasonally adjusted new industrial orders in
April matched the previous month’s level; at
33/C254%, the March result had brought a consid-
erable increase on the decidedly low figure
for February. This was therefore a 11/C252% in-
crease in orders in April compared with the
average of the first quarter. At 5%, the rise
was especially sharp in the case of intermedi-
ate goods, while mostly negative figures wereEconomic conditions in Germany*

7recorded in the capital goods sector. The
order situation benefited mainly from exportorders which, in April, were 2
3/C254% up on the
level of the first quarter. According to this cal-culation, domestic orders merely held theirlevel of the first quarter in seasonally adjustedterms, even though the underlying trend hasbeen showing a moderate improvement sinceFebruary. In April, the year-on-year decline inorders was quite considerable at almost one-third in terms of volume.
ConstructionSeasonally adjusted construction output went
up by 0.5% in April. This followed a notablerecovery in March (+6.0%) from its weather-affected low February level. Constructionoutput at the beginning of the second quar-ter was thus 5% up on the first quarter.Besides continuing catching-up effects, thiswas due chiefly to the increased implementa-tion of a large number of infrastructure pro-jects financed by resources from the cyclicalstimulus packages. Overall, however, construc-tion orders were 2
1/C254% down on the final
quarter of 2008 owing to a sharp fall in pri-vate construction demand.
Labour marketThe impact of the economic crisis on the
labour market has been subdued hitherto,although the negative effects are increasinglybeing felt. According to initial estimates bythe Federal Statistical Office, the seasonallyadjusted number of persons in work in Aprilfell by 60,000 on the month to 40.17 million.The year-on-year decline widened to 150,000.March also saw a noticeable fall in the num-
ber of employees subject to social securitycontributions. According to estimates by theFederal Employment Agency, short-time work-ing benefits on economic grounds wereclaimed by 1.1 million employees in April andMay, as was the case in March. In January, thisaffected only 440,000 persons. In February,the figure was already 930,000. According tothe BA-X index, there was a further decline inMay in the willingness of enterprises to recruitnew staff, and the Ifo employment barometerremained at a depressed level.
Following a sharp rise in April, the unemploy-
ment level remained largely unchanged inMay at a seasonally adjusted 3.46 million.The delayed spring pick-up in the labour mar-ket this year is likely to have played a role inthis context. According to estimates by theFederal Employment Agency, without thechangeover in the labour market statistics– since the beginning of May, persons formal-ly on the books of private employment agen-cies are not counted as being unemployed –the rise in unemployment would have beenbetween 15,000 and 20,000. The unemploy-ment figure showed a year-on-year increaseof 175,000 in May. The unemployment ratewent up by 0.4 percentage point on the year.However, owing to the Federal EmploymentAgency’s annual adjustment of the figure forthe labour force, it was 0.1 percentage pointlower than in April at a seasonally adjusted8.2%.

8Prices
Crude oil prices continued to accelerate
owing to the brightening of the global eco-
nomic outlook. At US$581/C252on a monthly
average in May, the spot price for Brent North
Sea oil was 131/C252% higher than in April. The
increases in the forward markets were some-
what smaller, but prices for future deliveries
of crude oil were still being quoted with
marked premiums; US$31/C254and US$71/C254were
being charged for six-month and 18-month
deliveries respectively. As this report went to
press, the spot price stood at US$71.
Price reductions at the upstream stages of the
economy continued at the end of the period
under review. In seasonally adjusted terms,
the cost of imports in April was 1.0% down
on the month and 8.6% down on the year.
Seasonally adjusted industrial producer prices
remained unchanged in May; the year-on-
year rate was -3.6%. Energy prices rose again
somewhat on the month in the wake of
higher oil prices, while prices of intermediate
goods continued to ease. The prices of fin-
ished goods (capital and consumer goods)
showed little change.
Following a slight rise in April, consumer
prices declined again in May by a seasonally
adjusted 0.1%. On average, consumer prices
were therefore no higher than at the begin-
ning of this year. In seasonally adjusted terms,
consumers had less to pay for food, package
holidays and air travel, while the prices of
other services showed a moderate rise. Not
least owing to base effects, the overall figure
for the national consumer price index (CPI)fell to 0.0% and for the Harmonised Index
of Consumer Prices (HICP) was likewise down
to 0.0%, compared with 0.7% and 0.8%
respectively in April.
Public finances1
Statutory health insurance scheme
In the first quarter of 2009, the statutory
health insurance scheme recorded an overall
surplus of 31 billion after posting a deficit of
the same size a year earlier. Although expend-
iture saw a steep rise of just over 6%, rev-
enue was up significantly more sharply, by
12%. This is mainly attributable to the new
system of financing the health insurance insti-
tutions via the health insurance fund. The
fund makes monthly payments to the health
insurance institutions which remain largely
stable throughout the year. In contrast to the
typical pattern of weak contribution receipts
at the beginning of the year which are then
boosted at the end of the year by seasonal
bonus payments, the new pattern is much
more balanced from the perspective of the
health insurance institutions. Year-on-year
growth in revenue has therefore initially been
particularly strong among the health insur-
ance institutions, although this trend will re-
verse itself over the remainder of the year.
The tight liquidity conditions at the beginning
of the year are currently affecting the health

9insurance fund, which now receives insured
persons’ contribution payments and, lackingits own reserves, was dependent in the firstquarter on transfers from the Federal budget,some of which had been brought forward.Revenue from insured persons’ contributionswas up by 6% on the year, which was duelargely to the introduction of the higher uni-form contribution rate of 15.5% to the newhealth insurance fund at the beginning of theyear. Adjusted for the change in the contri-bution rate, revenue growth stood at 1
1/C252%.
The negative impact of the economic down-turn was cushioned by stable pensions andcontributions for recipients of short-timeworking and unemployment benefits.
Health insurance institutions’ expenditure on
benefits rose by 6
1/C252%, with particularly
strong growth in payments for out-patienttreatment (+9%) resulting from the new re-muneration arrangements. Owing to theHospital Financing Reform Act (Krankenhaus-
finanzierungsreformgesetz) – which stipu-
lates that, among other things, half of thecosts associated with the rises in negotiatedrates of pay introduced in 2008 and 2009 canbe passed on to the health insurance insti-tutions – there was also a clear increase(+5
1/C252%) in the outlays for hospital treatment,
which are quantitatively the most significantexpenditure item. Growth in spending onpharmaceuticals, at 5
1/C252%, continued at its
recent high level.
Over the year as a whole, the health insur-
ance institutions will probably be able tocover the significant increase in their expend-iture with the predetermined transfers fromthe health insurance fund, and individual
health insurance institutions’ demands foradditional contributions from their membersare likely to remain very limited. However, thehealth insurance fund is facing a tighterfinancial situation. On economic policygrounds (second economic stimulus pack-age), the contribution rate will be reducedfrom 15.5% to 14.9% on 1 July. The resultingshortfalls in revenue to the health insurancefund will be offset by bringing forward the in-crease of just over 33 billion in the Federal
grant originally planned for the coming years.Owing to the unfavourable macroeconomictrend

10opment, however, over the year as a whole
the fund is unlikely to be able to finance the
stipulated transfers to the health insurance
institutions using contributions and the regu-
lar Federal grants. Additional liquidity assist-
ance – for which the second supplementary
Federal budget contains an appropriation au-
thorisation of 34 billion for 2009 from central
government – will therefore be required.
These funds must be paid back by the end of
2011 at the latest. For next year, the uniform
contribution rate of 14.9% will only need to
be raised if the expected revenue from contri-
butions and the regular Federal grant is not
sufficient to cover at least 95% of the health
insurance institutions’ planned expenditure.
Any financing gaps experienced by individual
institutions will have to be offset by additional
contributions.Public long-term care insurance scheme
For the first quarter of 2009, the public long-
term care insurance scheme posted a margin-
al surplus after recording a deficit of 31/C254bil-
lion a year earlier. Owing primarily to the rise
in the contribution rate from 1.7% to 1.95%
(plus a special contribution of 0.25% to be
paid by childless persons) following the nurs-
ing care reform of 1 July 2008, revenue
growth, at 151/C252%, was very robust. After ad-
justment for the increased contribution rate,
contributions rose by as little as just over 1%.
Growth in expenditure accelerated to just
over 6% as the nursing care reform entailed a
substantial extension of benefits. Reserves
amounted to 34 billion at the end of March.
The public long-term care insurance scheme
is also likely to post a surplus for 2009 as a
whole. Following the season pattern, fiscal
balances typically tend to improve towards
the end of the year. However, the one-off im-
pact of the nursing care reform will no longer
be felt in the second half of the year, and the
unfavourable macroeconomic trend poses a
risk. As in the statutory health insurance
scheme, the effect of the resulting revenue
shortfalls will initially be cushioned by contri-
butions for unemployed recipients of wage
substitutes and by pensions. Nevertheless, in
the medium to long term, the foreseeable in-
crease in the number of long-term care pa-
tients owing to demographic developments
and the planned regular adjustments of bene-
fits mean that further rises in the contribution
rates can be expected.Finances of the public long-

11Securities markets
Bond market
In April, the gross issuance volume in the
German bond market amounted to 3152.9
billion, exceeding the figure in the previous
month by 35.9 billion. After deducting re-
demptions – which were likewise higher
(3146.0 billion) – and taking account of
changes in issuers’ holdings of their own
bonds, the volume of domestic debt securities
outstanding increased by 33.8 billion. In the
reporting month, sales of foreign debt secur-
ities in the German market amounted to 34.4
billion; on balance, this consisted exclusively
of euro-denominated securities. Therefore,
the total outstanding volume of debt secur-
ities in Germany rose by 38.3 billion.
In April, the public sector once again in-
creased its bond market borrowing, raising
315.1 billion compared with 38.8 billion in
March. Central government enlarged its cap-
ital market debt by 39.4 billion. As in the pre-
ceding months, it issued primarily short-dated
Treasury discount paper (Bubills) for 314.6 bil-
lion. It also issued two-year Federal Treasury
notes (Sch/C228tze) for 37.1 billion, ten-year Fed-
eral bonds (Bunds) for 34.8 billion and, to a
lesser extent, Federal savings notes for 30.1
billion. This contrasted with net redemptions
of five-year Federal notes (Bobls), thirty-year
Bunds and Federal Treasury financing paper
(316.4 billion, 30.6 billion and 30.1 billion
respectively). State governments tapped the
German bond market for 35.9 billion in April.In the reporting month, German enterprises
also enlarged their capital market debt by
34.5 billion, a significantly larger increase than
in the previous month ( 30.1 billion). In net
terms, these were all bonds with original
maturities of more than one year.
By contrast, in April, domestic credit institu-
tions further reduced their capital market
debt, a process which they began in Decem-
ber 2008. Overall, they redeemed their own
bonds worth 315.8 billion net. These included,
above all, public Pfandbriefe ( 37 . 3b i l l i o n )a n d
mortgage Pfandbriefe ( 33.9 billion) as well as
other bank debt securities which can be
structured flexibly ( 31.1 billion). Specialised

motional banks, also scaled down the out-Sales and purchases

12standing volume of their own bonds (by 33.4
billion).
German non-banks were the main purchasers
of debt securities in April. They added debt
securities worth 37.5 billion net to their port-
folios; the majority of these were foreign
debt instruments ( 37.0 billion). Non-resident
investors purchased 31.0 billion worth of Ger-
man bonds, predominantly public-sector in-
struments ( 34.7 billion). Domestic credit insti-
tutions sold interest-bearing paper with a total
net value of 30.3 billion. They sold, above all,
foreign paper ( 32.6 billion) and own debt in-
struments ( 33.1 billion) and purchased public
debt securities ( 36.0 billion).
Equity market
In comparison with the previous month, the
issuance volume in the German equity
market was very modest in April ( 30.6 billion
compared with 34.1 billion in March). The
majority of these issues took the form of
listed shares ( 30.5 billion). The stock of
foreign equities in the German market
decreased by 30.9 billion in April, meaning
that the total volume of shares outstanding in
Germany diminished by 30.2 billion. Domes-
tic credit institutions were the main pur-
chasers of equities ( 312.6 billion). In addition,
German non-banks increased their sharehold-
ings by 32.3 billion. By contrast, foreign in-
vestors – as in previous years – sold German
stocks ( 315.1 billion net) ahead of the divi-
dend payment dates.Mutual fund shares
Domestic mutual funds recorded an inflow of
32.0 billion in April following an outflow of
30.1 billion in the previous month. The capital
inflow was channelled above all into mutual
funds open to the general public ( 32.2 bil-
lion), while specialised funds reserved for in-
stitutional investors recorded a slight outflow
of30.2 billion. Of the mutual funds open to
the general public, equity-based funds and
bond-based funds ( 31.0 billion in each case)
as well as open-end real estate funds ( 30.6
billion) recorded greater investment activity.
By contrast, 30.3 billion worth of share certifi-
cates in money market funds were sold. For-
eign mutual funds once again repurchased
shares from German investors in April ( 32.5
billion). While domestic credit institutions and
non-banks cashed in mutual fund shares in
net terms ( 31.8 billion and 30.6 billion
respectively), foreign investors purchased
31.9 billion worth of German mutual fund
products.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur-
plus – in unadjusted terms – of 35.8 billion in
April 2009. The result was thus 35.2 billion
down on the level of the previous month.
This can be attributed to a smaller trade sur-
plus and a turnaround resulting in a deficit in
terms of invisible current transactions, which
comprise services, income and current trans-
fers.Purchases of

13According to provisional figures released by
the Federal Statistical Office, in April the for-eign trade surplus went down by 31.9 billion
on the month to 39.4 billion. By contrast,
after adjustment for seasonal and calendareffects, it remained practically unchanged at39.0 billion. The value of imports declined
– from a relatively low level – more sharply(-5.8%) than that of exports (-4.8%). Com-pared with the first-quarter average, season-ally adjusted nominal exports went down by5.0%, while imports decreased by 7.3%.More than one-fifth of the decline in importsis attributable to lower prices, especially forsome energy sources.
A deficit of 33.1 billion was recorded for in-
visible current transactions in April, comparedwith a surplus of 30.7 billion in March. This
turnaround is the result of the deteriorationin the income balance, which declined by34.9 billion to 30.1 billion. The sharp increase
in dividend payments to non-residents was amajor contributory factor. By contrast, thedeficit in services remained stable at 30.7 bil-

Cross-border portfolio investment was dom-
inated by net capital exports in April(313.0 billion), compared with inflows of
33.8 billion in March. This reversal was due to
the fact that foreign investors sold Germansecurities ( 312.2 billion) after acquiring do-
mestic paper to the amount of 35.1 billion in
the preceding month. As usual in the run-upto the dividend payment dates, they sold Ger-man shares ( 315.2 billion), albeit to a lesser

14(345.9 billion). Conversely, they invested in
mutual fund shares ( 31.9 billion) and debt se-
curities ( 31.0 billion). With respect to debt se-
curities, foreign investors shifted considerable
funds out of bonds and notes ( 312.2 billion)
and into money market paper ( 313.3 billion).
In April, German investors purchased 30.7 bil-
lion worth of foreign securities. While pur-
chasing debt securities – in particular, bonds
and notes – from abroad ( 34.4 billion), they
disposed of mutual fund shares and shares to
the combined value of 33.7 billion.
Direct investment activity likewise resulted in
net capital exports. However, at 34.7 billion
this figure was just below half the level re-
corded for the previous month. German par-
ent companies provided their foreign
branches with funds amounting to 35.7 bil-
lion. They primarily increased their capital
stakes abroad ( 37.4 billion), whereby a large
part of this amount was dedicated to bolster-
ing capital reserves of subsidiaries in order to
offset losses. By contrast, German enterprises
experienced inflows of funds ( 32.5 billion)
from intra-group credit transactions. This
took the form, in particular, of repayments oftrade credits by affiliated enterprises abroad.
In the reporting month, investment by foreign
proprietors in Germany was limited ( 31.0 bil-
lion).
Other statistically recorded investment com-
prising financial and trade credits (where
these do not constitute direct investment) as
well as bank deposits and other assets saw
inflows of funds from abroad in April
(310.8 billion compared with capital exports
of315.7 billion in March). A major role here
was played by 39.3 billion worth of inflows of
funds to non-banks. Of this amount, 38.2 bil-
lion resulted from the activities of general
government, which in particular took up
short-term loans abroad. A further 31.1 bil-
lion were generated by the transactions of
enterprises and households. In the banking
system, unsecuritised credit transactions led
to additional inflows worth 31.5 billion as
credit institutions substantially increased both
their short-term external claims and their
short-term external liabilities.

15Outlook for the
German economy –
macroeconomic
projections for 2009
and 2010The German economy is currently ex-
periencing a sharp recession. The eco-
nomic downturn of the global econ-
omy, accompanied by an unexpectedly
severe drop in global trade, has hit Ger-
man industry hard. As a consequence,
other sectors have also suffered and
have cut back their investment plans. By
contrast, the labour market response
has been moderate to date.
With the gradual easing of tensions on
the international financial markets, im-
proved expectations and the extensive
monetary and fiscal stimuli, the down-
ward pressure on the German econ-
omy should ease during 2009. How-
ever, a real rebound rather than a
mere bottoming-out is expected only
in the course of 2010. According to this
baseline scenario, which is associated
with a high degree of uncertainty, real
gross domestic product will contract by
around 6% in 2009. In 2010, economic
activity is expected to remain subdued,
despite a slight revival in the course of
the year. The price climate remains
benign and supportive for economic
activity. On an annual average, con-
sumer prices are forecast to rise by1/C252%
in 2010, following a stable price level
this year.

16Current situation
The German economy has entered a severe
recession. In the first quarter of 2009, price-
adjusted gross domestic product (GDP)
dropped by 3.8% on the quarter after sea-
sonal and calendar adjustment, having al-
ready suffered a considerable decline of
2.2% in the previous quarter. Year-on-year
aggregate output therefore contracted by al-
most 7% in the first three months of 2009 in
calendar-adjusted terms. The exceptionally
strong cut-back in production can mainly be
attributed to the sharp slump in world trade
and the associated decline in global demand
for German industrial products. For example,
exports of goods and services were almost
10% down in seasonally and calendar-
adjusted terms quarter on quarter in the first
three months of the year, having already
shrunk by 8% in the previous period. As a
consequence, industrial investment was like-
wise sharply curtailed given significant cap-
acity underutilisation and poor sales and
earnings prospects. Furthermore, enterprises
started to correct the involuntary build-up of
inventories that occurred in the second half
of 2008. Aggregate demand in the first quar-
ter of 2009 was buoyed only by private and
government consumption. This owed much
to the “environmental premium” that since
the end of January has been paid to house-
holds in Germany who buy a new passenger
car and scrap their old one.
The decline in real economic activity in the
fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of
2009 was therefore much more pronounced
than predicted in the baseline forecast ofDecember 2008.1For example, aggregate out-
put in the first quarter of 2009 was more than
5% lower than expected. Although the risk of
a significantly harsher economic downturn in
the short term was recognised as an alternative
scenario in the December projection, the rapid
downward pace, especially in industry, came as
a surprise. Even the alternative scenarios had
not envisaged a downturn of this force, which
is without historical parallel.
The renewed turmoil in the financial system in
the wake of the insolvency of the Lehman
Brothers investment bank rapidly spilled over
to the real economy in numerous regions via
several transmission channels. The general
shock to confidence, in particular, aggravated
the already perceptible slowdown in global ac-
tivity. This had been presaged by corrections on
major real estate markets, the increasing global
inflationary pressure up to the third quarter of
2008 and growing external imbalances in a
number of emerging market economies and
developed into a exceptionally severe reces-
sion. Besides the industrialised countries, emer-
ging market economies and developing coun-
tries, particularly central and east European
c o u n t r i e s ,w e r ea l s os u c k e di n t ot h em a e l s t r o m
of the crisis. A defining feature of this global
recession is not only its depth but also the high
degree of synchronicity of the downward
swings in the individual economies and re-
gions, together with an abrupt contraction of
demand for internationally tradable goods.2

17Shorter working hours have, to date, largely
absorbed the impact of the sharp economicdownturn on the labour market – as antici-pated in the forecast of December 2008.Overtime and working time accounts wererun down, and increasing use was made ofshort-time work. This resulted in a 3.4% de-cline in the calendar-adjusted number ofhours worked per employed person since thefirst quarter of 2008. By contrast, the impacton employment has been very muted so far.According to initial estimates for the fourthquarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009,which must be regarded as preliminary, em-ployment actually rose by 43,000, or 0.1%,on the year. As a mirror image, average un-employment measured for the quarter was53,000 lower than a year earlier. This wasone reason why the decline in the total num-ber of hours worked in the first quarter of2009 was, at 3.3% on the year, smaller thanthe drop in aggregate value added despitethe clear reduction in working hours. It isstriking in the current phase that hourly prod-uctivity also fell markedly (-3.7%), while unitlabour costs jumped (+8.7%). The wage ratiorose sharply. During the first five months of2009, the labour market situation deterior-ated perceptibly, however. The number of un-employed increased by 235,000 from Decem-ber 2008 after seasonal adjustment, whilethe employment outlook, as expressed in thesurveys conducted by the Ifo Institute anddata on vacancies released by the Federal Em-ployment Agency, became increasingly nega-tive.
In the first quarter of 2009, consumer price
inflation, as measured by the HarmonisedIndex of Consumer Prices, flattened further;
the annual rate fell to 0.8%, compared with1.6% in the fourth quarter of 2008. The fig-ure for the first quarter of 2009 was thus0.3 percentage point lower than expected inthe projection of December 2008. The mainfactor here were significantly lower energyprices.
Economic policymakers’ response to the
worsening financial and real economic crisishas been rapid and comprehensive. The Euro-pean Central Bank lowered the interest ratefor its weekly main refinancing operations inseveral stages from 4.25% to 1%. In add-ition, longer-term refinancing transactionswere offered in the form of fixed-rate tenderswith full allotment. This has stabilised themoney market at a significantly lower interestrate level. In future, the Eurosystem will alsobuy covered bonds in order to bring about afurther improvement in financing conditionsin the banking sector. The Financial MarketStabilisation Fund (Finanzmarktstabilisier-
ungsfonds) set up in October 2008 has al-
ready made a major contribution to stabilisingGermany’s financial system by offering guar-antees and implementing measures to recap-italise banks. In addition, banks are to begiven the option of offloading financial assetswith severe impairment risk to special pur-pose vehicles (“bad banks”). Fiscal policy hasnot only allowed the automatic stabilisers totake full effect, it has also supported theoperability of the German banking systemthrough the financing offered by the FinancialMarket Stabilisation Fund. Moreover, the eco-nomic stimulus programmes I and II havestrengthened consumers’ purchasing power

and higher social transfers, reduced the im-
mediate labour market risk by stepping up
subsidies for short-time work and supported
the construction and automobile sectors, in
particular, by means of sector-specific meas-
ures. Furthermore, large-scale loan and guar-
antee programmes have been set up for the
business sector.
Major assumptions3
The baseline forecast presented here is predi-
cated on the underlying hypothesis that the
large-scale measures taken to support the
financial markets, the exceptional monetary
policy stimuli and the large-scale fiscal pack-
ages adopted in numerous countries will help
stabilise the global economy in the course of
2009. The ensuing recovery will continue at a
moderate pace in 2010. Following a 2% de-
cline this year, global output could increase
by 13/C254% in 2010. International trade in
goods and services is expected to exhibit an
even more pronounced profile. As the slump
in global demand has mainly affected inter-
nationally tradable goods, and cross-border
sales have suffered disproportionately as a re-
sult of the numerous international production
links, global trade is expected to shrink very
much faster than output this year, at an esti-
mated 13%. Bearing in mind, too, that de-
mand for domestic goods should be the main
beneficiary of the macroeconomic stimuli, the
revival in external trade is likely to be fairly
muted in 2010, at +1%. Germany’s export
markets are expected to contract almost as
rapidly as global trade in 2009 and achieveonly a slight recovery in 2010. As compared
with the projection of December 2008, the
rate of change expected for German export-
ers’ sales market volume has consequently
been lowered by 14 percentage points for
2009 and 4 percentage points for 2010. This
is a direct reflection of the huge deterioration
in the external sales outlook.
As in previous projections, due account was
taken of the impact of the financial market
crisis on the cost of corporate debt financing
by pricing in additional interest rate premiums
on loans to enterprises. However, these are
slightly lower than in the December forecast,
reflecting the fact that slight tendencies to-
wards stress relief have been evident of late.
Moreover, account was taken of the finding
of the Bank Lending Survey (BLS) that credit
standards have recently been tightened
across the board. For the projection period, it
is assumed that the situation on the financial
markets will gradually ease and that Germany
will not experience a general credit crunch.
The projection is based on the technical
assumption of an unchanged euro exchange
rate of US$1.34 over the forecasting horizon.
The euro’s nominal effective exchange rate
against the currencies of the 21 most import-
ant trading partners of the euro area is as-
sumed to be1/C252% below its average value for
2008. This signifies a slight improvement in the
euro area’ s price competitiveness. The interest
rate assumptions derived from market expect-

19ations envisage an average level for the three-
month EURIBOR of 1.4% in 2009 and 1.6% in2010, compared with 4.6% last year. Thelong-term yield on German government bondsis likely to be 3.4% this year and 3.9% nextyear, according to the current market view.
The spot price for Brent crude oil, which last
year plummeted from just under US$147 perbarrel in July to US$41 in December, has sinceclimbed back up noticeably. Judging by for-ward prices, this tendency is likely to continueover the forecasting horizon. Accordingly, theprojection is based on the assumption of anoil price of US$54.5 in 2009 and US$65.5 in2010. Taking into account the exchange rateassumption, this means that, this year, theprice of crude oil in euro terms will be almosttwo-fifths below its average level for 2008.The assumptions regarding the crude oil pricein 2009 and 2010 are therefore more thanUS$10 lower than in the projection of De-cember 2008. For the other commodities (ex-cluding energy), market players currently an-ticipate a drop in prices by one-fifth in 2009on an annual average. A rise of just under9% has been priced in for the following year.
In public finances, all measures were taken
into consideration which have either beenadopted or which have been specified in suf-ficient detail and are likely to be approved.For example, the fact that the contributionrate to the statutory health insurancescheme, which was raised at the beginning ofthe year, will be lowered to 14.9% from July2009 onwards was taken into account andthe assumption made that many health insur-ance institutions will therefore charge add-itional contributions, which will have to be
borne in full by insurees (rather than beingsplit with employers as is the case for regularcontributions). In terms of the tax regime,due account was taken, inter alia , of the
more generous depreciation allowances forenterprises and the gradual reduction in in-come tax rates which were agreed with theeconomic stimulus packages. Other import-ant factors are the higher income tax allow-ances for contributions to health and long-term care insurance schemes from 2010 aswell as the reintroduction of the original(more generous) commuting allowance.
On the expenditure side, the “environmental
premium” for old cars, the budget for whichhas been increased from 31.5 billion to 35 bil-

20bour market measures are having an impact.
Account was also taken of the fact that gov-
ernment investment is being strongly expand-
ed. Expenditure will be further boosted as a
result of higher healthcare spending owing to
the new arrangements for the remuneration
of outpatient treatment and hospital finan-
cing as well as the suspension of the “Riester
factor” in the pension adjustment formula,
which was introduced to curb pension in-
creases and is meant to reflect rising supple-
mentary private pension provision by employ-
ees. Finally, the assumption was made that
government support measures for financial
institutions that have been announced to
date will affect public debt levels in 2009 but
not the deficit as defined under the Maas-
tricht Treaty and will have virtually no further
impact on public finances in 2010.
Cyclical outlook4
The economic downturn in the fourth quarter
of 2008 and first quarter of 2009 was much
stronger than expected in the forecast of De-
cember 2008. However, there is now increas-
ing evidence that recessionary tendencies
have weakened in the second quarter of
2009. For example, according to the Ifo busi-
ness survey, enterprises now view their out-
look for the next six months significantly less
pessimistically than at the turn of the year. In
March, seasonally adjusted manufacturing
orders from abroad experienced the first
month-on-month increase in a long time. In
February and March, goods exports were
largely unchanged from January – following
the sharp decline in the preceding months.Besides the financial market indicators, there
is therefore much to suggest that the pace of
the economic downturn will slow noticeably
after the first quarter. However, the extremely
weak orders situation in manufacturing, the
persistent downward movement in industrial
investment and the possibly ongoing destock-
ing of inventories are indications that the
contractionary effects will, on balance, con-
tinue to dominate in the second quarter.
The downward slide in the German economy
could bottom out in the third quarter of
2009. One indication is that the retarding fac-
tors from abroad are gradually receding. An-
other is that domestic demand is being sup-
ported by fiscal policy. Public construction in-
vestment, for example, will increase signifi-
cantly, and private consumption will probably
continue to make a contribution to stabilisa-
tion given lower direct taxes and social contri-
butions and higher social benefit payments
accompanied by a still favourable price cli-
mate.
A radical recovery looks unlikely in the near
future, however. This year will see barely any
expansionary stimuli from abroad, and the
downward pressure on industrial investment
will continue for some time. Although the ex-
ternal impulses could pick up in 2010, private

22 May 2009. The result of the GDP flash estimate of
15 May for the first quarter of 2009 was therefore in-
cluded, but not additional information, in particular on
the expenditure structure of GDP , which the Federal Stat-
istical Office published on 26 May 2009. As no detailed
information on the reasons for the slight downward revi-
sion of price-adjusted GDP in the fourth quarter of 2008
(from a seasonally and calendar-adjusted -2.1% on the
quarter to -2.2%) was available when the projection was
completed, this was also not factored in.Starting point

21consumption is likely to be increasingly dog-
ged by a lagged rise in unemployment. Over-all, price-adjusted GDP could decline by 6.2%this year in calendar-year terms and stagnatethroughout 2010 on an annual average, des-pite a slight upward movement over thecourse of the year.
The sharp demand shock will inevitably im-
pact on Germany’s industrial output capacity.Capacity in important sectors of the economywill be gradually adjusted to lower demandby holding back extension investment projectsand not realising some planned replacementinvestments. To a fairly small extent to date,production plants may also have become ob-solete; as far as it is possible to tell at present,this is confined to just a few sectors. Over theforecasting horizon, the annual increase inpotential output will consequently be lowerthan previously, at roughly 1 %. Combiningdemand and supply effects, overall capacityutilisation is nevertheless likely to decline no-ticeably this year. On an annual average, cap-acity underutilisation, at 6
1/C252%, will probably
far undershoot the lows of past recessions.Under the baseline scenario, the output gapwill widen to almost 7
1/C252% next year.
Following plummeting exports in the fourth
quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009,foreign demand for German products hasnow rallied somewhat. The severely de-pressed level at the beginning of the yearmeans that real exports of goods and servicesthis year are nevertheless likely to be almost17% lower than in 2008. Exports would thushave shrunk even more than the contractionof the foreign sales markets overall. One ex-planation for this is that the retarding effect
emanating from global trade is being aggra-vated by the product profile of German ex-port goods, which is dominated by capitalgoods (including passenger cars).

22The muted or still uncertain sales outlook and
the exceptionally high underutilisation of
overall production capacity – also by historical
standards – will severely dent industrial in-
vestment. Moreover, debt financing condi-
tions are difficult, in some cases, although
this has much less of an impact than weak
demand, as external financing requirements
are relatively small and the balance sheet
structure of the non-financial corporate sec-
tor is sound. Overall, industrial investment
may decline by some 15% in 2009 and a fur-
ther 6% in 2010.
The measures decided in the German govern-
ment’s two economic stimulus packages will
lead to a big expansion of public construction
investment over the forecasting horizon. As
public construction represents just 61/C252%o ftotal fixed investment, it will not, however, be
able to offset the drop in industrial invest-
ment. The exact timing of the additional
public-sector investment to be made under
the economic stimulus programme is still un-
certain, moreover; nor is it evident how the
criterion that such investment spending must
be “additional” will be defined. Housing con-
struction is also likely to remain fairly muted,
so it must be assumed that total gross fixed
capital formation will fall by 10% this year
and a further 23/C254% next year in price-
adjusted terms.
The unexpectedly sharp drop in demand
meant that numerous sectors of the economy
experienced an involuntary build-up of inven-
tories at the end of 2008 despite the prompt
production cutbacks. Over the course of
2009, enterprises will consequently reduce
stocks to desired levels. This will make a
negative contribution to growth of1/C252percent-
age point in 2009 and a positive contribution
of1/C254percentage point in 2010.
Consumer spending by households will slight-
ly buoy macroeconomic growth this year. Re-
lief from direct taxes and social contributions
and higher social transfers as well as the con-
tinuing benign price climate are having a
positive impact on consumers’ real disposable
income. The environmental premium, which
sharply boosted passenger car sales in the
first few months of 2009, has been a key

the positive impact of the environmental pre-mium will gradually subside, and the effectwill be reversed in 2010 at the latest. More-over, private consumption is increasinglybeing depressed by rising unemployment; an-other negative factor is reduced property in-come, partly as a result of lower interestrates. Having risen by
1/C254% this year, real con-
sumer spending is likely to fall by3/C254%i n

While the marked slowdown in macroeco-
nomic activity has, to date, largely been ab-sorbed by a decrease in the number of work-ing hours and declining hourly productivity,enterprises will increasingly try to adjust la-bour input to the lower sales prospects. Ac-cordingly, hourly labour productivity will pickup again during 2009. Nevertheless, it coulddecline by 2
1/C252% in 2009 on an annual aver-
age, before rising by 13/C254% in 2010. Yet even
in the last quarter of the forecasting horizon,labour productivity will still not have returnedto the high it marked in the first quarter of2008, as the share of value added in the par-ticularly productive manufacturing sector willremain below normal.

24tion of hiring new staff (filling vacancies) and
laying off existing workers. At the same time,
working hours could start to return to their
normal level towards the end of 2009. On an
annual average, the number of people in
work is expected to decline by 350,000 in
2009, ie by just under 1%. The following year,
in accordance with the typically lagged labour
market response, employment could well
contract by a further 1.1 million, or 23/C254%.
These much lower employment levels will
not, however, be fully reflected in higher un-
employment. First, the supply of labour is fall-
ing for demographic reasons. Second, the
participation rate is likely to decline slightly
for cyclical reasons. And third, changes in the
methodology of recording persons formally
on the books of private employment agencies
will probably result in the number of those
registered as unemployed dropping by some
200,000 by the fourth quarter of this year.
Against this backdrop, unemployment can be
expected to rise to 3.5 million persons on
average in 2009 and 4.4 million in 2010. The
unemployment rate as defined by the Federal
Employment Agency would consequently rise
from 7.8% in 2008 to 8.4% in 2009 and
10.5% in 2010.
Labour costs and price outlook
Agreements in the 2009 wage round to date
are increasingly reflecting the subdued eco-
nomic situation, especially in manufacturing.
By contrast, fairly high rates of wage increase
were agreed in the services sectors, which
have been less hard hit. Including the incre-mental pay increases agreed last year, negoti-
ated wages are likely to increase by 21/C254%i n
2009 on average, after 23/C254% in 2008. In
2010, when the weight of the wage increases
agreed while labour market conditions were
still comparatively favourable will lessen, the
increase could flatten to 11/C252%.
Weak demand means that manufacturing en-
terprises, in particular, will push for the op-
tion, contained in the collective wage agree-
ments, to postpone pay rises or even reduce
one-off payments. In the metal-working and
electrical engineering industries, which have
been particularly badly affected by the eco-
nomic downturn, plant-level agreements are
permissible, for instance, which could put off
the 2.1% rise originally scheduled for May
2009 by up to seven months or reduce the
lump-sum payment agreed for September
2009. In addition, bonus payments based on
company performance will, in many sectors,
be much lower or cancelled altogether. Two
countervailing factors, on the other hand, are
the depletion of working time accounts and
employers’ frequent tendency to top up
short-time working pay. Both factors drive up
wage costs per actual hour worked. On a
monthly basis, the wage drift will be notice-
ably negative in 2009, however, given the dis-
tinct reduction in working hours, although
the delayed negotiated wage increases will
have to be implemented at a later date. Con-
versely, fewer and fewer payments will be
made to top up short-time working money.
As working hours pick up again, the pendu-
lum will swing back the other way, resulting
in a roughly neutral wage drift on a monthly
basis in 2010.Higher

25Value added per person employed will decline
markedly in 2009 given falling working hoursand a decline in hourly productivity. The risein unit labour costs will therefore more thandouble compared with 2008. The anticipatedheadcount reductions could boost labourproductivity by 3% again in the subsequentyear, and unit labour costs could fall by 1
1/C252%.
Nevertheless, neither the sharp increase inunit labour costs in 2009 nor their reductionin 2010 will have any major impact on pricedevelopments. It is more likely that enter-prises’ earnings will bear the brunt given theextremely difficult economic environment.The expected job cuts will partially offset en-terprises’ distinctly lower profitability. Salesprices are unlikely to rise much over the entireforecasting horizon, mainly because profitmargins will act as a buffer.
Year-on-year consumer price inflation will
temporarily enter negative territory over thenext few months as a delayed reaction to thesharp increase in energy and food prices intothe summer of 2008 and its subsequent par-tial correction. As the medium-term pricetrend – better reflected in seasonally adjustedquarter-on-quarter rates – will probably re-main in positive territory, year-on-year ratesshould pick up again towards year-end. Thisis supported by the renewed upward ten-dency on the international energy and agri-cultural markets as well as the expected fur-ther rise in wage costs. On an annual aver-age, consumer prices should remain virtuallyunchanged in 2009. In 2010, however, theycould rise by
1/C252%.Compared with the December 2008 projec-
tion, this represents a downwards revision of
3/C254percentage point for 2009 and just under
1 percentage point for 2010. A more benignprice outlook for energy and, to a lesser ex-tent, food and the less volatile components inthe basket of goods are the main driving fac-tors behind this. While price developmentsfor industrial products were affected by thedepreciation of the euro in the first half of2009, economic factors should dominatelater. Developments in prices for services andrents will be dampened by the more mutedrise in wage costs and disposable income.Price projection *

26Public finances6
The public finance situation will deteriorate
dramatically in 2009, and the deficit ratio is
likely to rise to over 3%. The effects of the
automatic stabilisers, and thus cyclical fac-
tors, account for approximately two-fifths of
the increase. However, the key macroeco-
nomic categories involved, such as gross
wages and salaries as well as private con-
sumption, will be much less severely affected
by the sharp recession than GDP . This there-
fore means that government revenue will
contract less sharply owing to the cyclical
downturn than the development of GDP
would imply. However, the cyclically adjusted
deficit will also rise considerably. This is due
mainly to deficit-increasing measures, espe-
cially the fiscal stimulus packages, which will
represent a total of around 11/C254% of GDP in
2009. Moreover, revenue from profit-related
taxes is likely to fall noticeably after having
reached an exceptionally high level in 2008.
The public finance situation will probably take
another sharp turn for the worse next year.
Even if the outlook for the economy bright-
ens somewhat, the cyclical impact is still likely
to lead to a further marked increase in the
deficits especially as, in contrast to 2009, the
overall GDP profile will probably be detrimen-
tal to public finances. Furthermore, fiscal pol-
icy measures, in particular greater tax deduct-
ibility of contributions to health and long-
term care insurance schemes, will place a dis-
cernible burden on general government
budgets, although several temporary stimulus
measures will come to an end. In addition,
revenue from profit-related taxes might wellcontinue to develop very poorly. The high ex-
pected deficits, the forecast drop in nominal
GDP and the measures to support financial
institutions are likely to dramatically push up
the debt ratio over the forecasting horizon,
which could reach a magnitude of 80% for
the first time ever.
Public finances are making a substantial con-
tribution to stabilisation in the current reces-
sion. In 2010, the fiscal stimulus, as measured
by the change in the primary balance (deficit
excluding interest expenditure) compared
with 2008, could well reach around 6% of
GDP , or 3130 billion to 3150 billion. Almost
three-fifths of this could be attributable to
the automatic stabilisers and the extraordin-
ary drop in profit-related taxes, with more
than two-fifths the result of discretionary
measures and other structural changes. This
does not yet include extensive measures to
stabilise the financial sector.
Risk assessment
Macroeconomic forecasts – in particular those
relating to real economic developments – are
currently subject to a very high degree of un-
certainty. One reason for this is that the dis-
ruptions to the financial markets are only
gradually receding, and it could take some
time to cleanse banks’ balance sheets. It will,
however, be virtually impossible to normalise

27the financial and economic situation without
re-establishing confidence. Although thereare some indications at the current end thatthe global retarding effects have eased, thepotential for a setback remains high. Experi-ence of past recessions that were accompan-ied by financial crises shows that they tend tolast for a long time, and recovery is usuallyslow.
7The baseline forecast is based on such
a pattern. This time, however, the financialmarket crisis is not confined to just one coun-try or region, but represents a global event.What is more, the pattern of past cycles can-not be expected to recur unaltered in the cur-rent situation as important sectors of theglobal economy face the challenge of struc-tural adjustment, and it is currently difficult toassess what new growth path the globaleconomy may be heading for.
In the current context, it is also difficult to as-
sess the effectiveness of monetary and fiscalpolicy. The central banks have massively ex-tended their liquidity operations, rapidlylowered interest rates to historical lows andhave also started to intervene directly in thecapital markets. All over the world, economicstimulus programmes including massive fiscalstimuli have been launched, and an unpre-cedented transfer of risk from the private tothe government sector has been set in train.Overall, both policy areas should make aconsiderable contribution to stabilisation. Thespectre of a downward economic spiralshould therefore have been banished. Never-theless, further negative surprises in thestricken banking sector or the still ailing finan-cial markets cannot be ruled out, which im-pedes a stable recovery.It is, however, quite possible that greater at-
tention will now be paid to fundamentals fol-lowing the severe slump in global output andworld trade and the paralysing effect of thecollapse of Lehman Brothers. In such a scen-ario, combined with stimuli from the inven-tory cycle, global economic activity might re-Baseline and uncertainty

28cover more strongly. Economies focusing
strongly on exports, notably of capital goods,
would benefit greatly from such a scenario,
just as they have been disproportionately
hard hit by the steep decline in global trade.
There is therefore a definite chance that Ger-
many may regain some of the ground it lost
in exports, and therefore output, in the fourth
quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009
more rapidly than outlined in the baseline
projection.
Employment has, to date, held up fairly well
in Germany compared with the decline in
macroeconomic activity. However, unemploy-
ment is expected to rise significantly over the
forecasting period. This could be prevented
only by a very rapid and strong revival of the
global economy. Although there is some evi-
dence that households, in periods of eco-
nomic weakness, dip into their savings to
avoid having to cut back on consumption too
much, the rising risk of redundancy might
prompt them to at least defer larger con-
sumer purchases for reasons of caution. On
balance, this would hurt private consumption
more than anticipated.In terms of real economic activity, the risk pro-
file appears on the whole to be largely bal-
anced in terms of potential downside risks
and the chances of a more favourable devel-
opment. However, the attendant level of un-
certainty remains far higher than normal. This
is the case not only because of the ongoing
tensions in connection with the financial mar-
ket crisis, but also because the timing of cyc-
lical turning points and the strength of the
subsequent recovery are particularly difficult
to forecast.
The risk assessment for cost and price devel-
opments is closely tied to the balance of risks
to real economic activity. If the global econ-
omy experiences a “lean period” for much
longer, imported inflation would probably be
even weaker. If the global economy picks up
significantly, on the other hand, prices of en-
ergy and other commodities, in particular,
could rise more quickly than currently expect-
ed based on forward prices. Overall, however,
the balance of risks in terms of inflation
seems likewise to be largely balanced. A pro-
longed drop in the general price level is
unlikely.Labour market

29Growth effects of
permanently high
energy prices: recent
evidence for GermanyThe international oil markets had to
contend with considerable volatility in
the past few years. The price of crude
oil rose steeply until mid-2008 and
then underwent a sharp correction on
account of the severe global recession.
However, at present, it is still relatively
high compared to earlier economic
slumps. This indicates that, in the past
few years, energy use has not simply
been subject to temporary price vola-
tility but has instead become perman-
ently more expensive. Net energy-
importing economies are thus under-
going numerous supply and demand
adjustment processes.
One particular aim of this article is to
estimate the adverse effect of increases
in the price of energy use on the goods
and services supplied by the German
business sector over the 2004-08
period. A decisive factor with regard to
the longer-term consequences for
growth and wealth will be firms’ abil-
ity to adjust their assortment of prod-
ucts to changes in the structure of de-
mand and to convert their manufactur-
ing processes to less energy-intensive
methods. Economic and wage-setting
policy can play a key role in this con-
text.

30Energy prices in an environment of
high demand and scarce supply
During the last business cycle, global eco-
nomic activity was accompanied by an ex-
tremely strong reaction of the crude oil price.
After the New Economy bubble had burst
and the global economic downturn had sub-
sequently been overcome, the spot price for a
barrel of Brent crude initially fluctuated in a
band between US$20 and US$30 before then
jumping to over US$140 by July 2008. Cyclic-
al tensions emerged at this price level, and
the world economy rapidly descended into a
sharp and synchronised slump following the
escalation of the financial crisis in September
2008. Against this background, the oil price
then fell by around US$100 within half a
year. Since the beginning of the year, how-
ever, it has rebounded steadily, to slightly
more than US$70.
Despite the deep global recession – notwith-
standing the fact that the OPEC nations have
in the meantime made concerted supply cut-
backs – international crude oil prices are cur-
rently still well above their level during the
comparatively mild economic downturn at
the beginning of this decade. This indicates
that the real price of oil has trended upwards
over the past few years. The oil price rally up
until mid-2008 was fundamentally justified
inasmuch as the highly energy-intensive na-
ture of the last growth cycle caused global
demand for crude oil to far outstrip supply.
Moreover, it was precisely in the last stage of
this rally, when the price of crude oil, which
was already quoting at US$70 a barrel, once
again doubled within a one-year period,where speculation is likely to have driven it to
exaggerated levels. Although the growing ac-
tivity of financial investors in the international
commodity markets tends to increase volatil-
ity, its impact on the long-term price path is
virtually nil.1For the question as to whether
or not adjustments are necessary, the volatil-
ity in the price of oil is less important than a
permanent level shift caused by economic
fundamentals. This is because purchases of
new consumer goods, like comprehensive in-
vestment in energy-saving technology and
the modification of production processes, will
pay off only if cost reductions can be
achieved over a relatively long time horizon.
Any such adjustments that have already been
made will not be reversed even if energy
costs fall because modifications entail consid-
erable fixed costs.
Along with the limited supply of fossil fuels
and rising exploration costs, the emerging
market economies’ rapidly growing hunger
for energy, which the advanced economies’
increased efforts to save energy are only part-
ly able to offset, would indicate that the price
path will be pointed upwards over the long
run. The formation of futures market prices
shows that this is also what market partici-
pants are expecting. During the last global
economic cycle, the term structure was point-
ed upwards on average, which, compared to
a “normal” situation where futures prices de-
cline over the maturity spectrum, indicates a

31pronounced expectation of rising prices.2The
sharp fall in spot prices in the second half of2008 coincided with a renewed massivewidening of the contango for forward deliv-ery contracts. In the light of future expect-ations, the current level of oil prices can thusbe assessed as low even though, in compari-son with the cyclical position of the worldeconomy, it should tend to be assessed ashigh.
Higher prices in the international crude oil
markets affect enterprises and households inthe net importing countries differently – de-pending on the volume and mix of energyconsumption. In Germany’s overall energymix, petroleum currently accounts for aroundone-third; however, the prices of other keysources of energy in Germany, particularlynatural gas, are pegged to the crude oil price.In addition, account has to be taken ofchanges in exchange rates because thesecommodities are usually denominated inUS dollars on international markets.
Considering the German economy as a
whole, rising energy prices initially amount toa transfer of real income to foreign countriessince the vast majority of the amount of pri-mary energy consumed domestically has tobe imported. One measure of the total bur-den on households and enterprises is theeconomy’s bill for imported energy, whichrose by just under 340 billion per year to 385
billion between 2004 and 2008.
3The value
of net energy imports a year earlier was thusaround 3
1/C252% of nominal gross domestic
product (GDP). The main reason for thestrong increase in expenditure on primary en-ergy imports was the doubling of energy
prices relative to the GDP deflator. What keptOil prices and term structure

32the outflow of income from being even
worse was that the euro appreciated against
the US dollar by nearly one-fifth during the
period under review. Additional relief was
provided by a moderate reduction in the
German economy’s dependency on imported
energy. Lastly, the overall energy intensity
also diminished, generally reflecting greater
thriftiness in the use of fuels and energy-
intensive inputs. In the business sector, rea-
sons for this trend include not only structural
change but also the increased use of energy-
saving technologies in the manufacturing
process. Households are modifying their con-
sumption habits inasmuch as they are redu-
cing the use of energy-intensive durable
goods – also in favour of comparable, yet
more energy-efficient, products. In housing
construction, for instance, new standards in
heating technology and insulation are
becoming established.
Moreover, consideration must be given to the
effects of interplay between the household
and business sectors. The reduced leeway for
expenditure caused by unavoidable spending
on energy and the price-induced shifts in the
structure of household demand impact on
the business sector by increasing the demand
for some goods and services and reducing
the demand for others. The new require-
ments for the assortment of goods and ser-
vices affect not only factors such as return on
investment but can also bring about changes
in the structure of the economy. In that vein,
one of the causes of the crisis affecting the
car industry, particularly in the United States,
is that the tremendous spike in fuel prices
which lasted until mid-2008 led to increasedpurchases of small and mid-sized cars, the
manufacture of which had been regarded for
a long time as relatively unprofitable. The
transfer of additional income to crude oil and
natural gas exporting countries associated
with rising energy prices is another factor
which causes changes in the demand struc-
ture; these countries reinject some of their
surpluses into the international trade cycle by
purchasing more consumer and capital
goods. During the past global economic up-
swing, this recycling of petrodollars through
the trade channel benefited, in particular,
German exporters, who have a relative com-
petitive advantage in the area of high-end
industrial goods.
Economic policy incentives are also important
alongside market-led adjustment mechan-
isms. As part of the “Ecological Tax Reform”
adopted by Germany’s “red-green” coalition
government, an additional levy was imposed
on the consumption of petroleum, gas and
electricity. A current example is the conver-
sion of the car tax to an emissions-based sys-
tem that incentivises the purchase of fuel-
saving cars. In addition, the CO 2Building
Rehabilitation Programme of the KfW Bank-
ing Group is promoting the modernisation of

All in all, a permanent increase in the energy
price level impacts on growth and welfare in
Germany in a variety of ways. The short-term

33long-term impacts also need to be con-
sidered. Whether or not the economy will be
permanently weakened by an oil price shock
will depend on how the bargaining parties
react to the reduction in the available real in-
come. The availability and use of energy-
saving technology and research into new pos-
sibilities for energy substitution also play a
key role in this context. For all of these fac-
tors, it is of paramount importance that the
business sector is able to fund investment in
productive capacities and research projects
and that cost pressures from other areas do
not put the expected return on capital under
pressure. The economy is in a much better
starting position now than during the two oil
price shocks of the 1970s because the last en-
ergy price surge was not followed by any sig-
nificant second-round effects. Instead, apart
from cyclically-induced higher labour com-
pensation growth towards the end of the up-
swing, wage-setting policy has maintained
moderation and remained focused on
employment throughout.
Change in consumption habits
Households currently devote, in nominal
terms, slightly more than 8% of their entire
consumer spending to energy use; around
one-third of this spending is on individual
transport and two-thirds on residential ex-
penditure. In the second category, the lion’s
share, or just under three-quarters, is for
space heating, followed by 12% for warm
water and just under 15% for all other uses,
such as lighting, cooking and the operation
of electrical appliances.4The utility of consumption for households is
usually created not by energy use itself but by
heat generation and in combination with dur-
able goods. The properties of these products
are the main determinants of the price elasti-
city of energy demand in the various areas of
application. When energy prices rise, a
household can initially curtail or avoid using
energy-intensive goods, provided this is con-
sistent with the household’s preferences. If,
as in the case of space heating and many
other durable goods, such options are limit-
ed, the alternative adjustment strategy is to
change over to more energy-efficient product
variants. In this context, key factors that af-
fect the decision include not only the pur-
chase price or costs of modification relative to
the expected savings but also technological
factors such as the service life of the durable
good and the availability of more energy-
efficient product types. Psychological aspects
such as perceptions and habits can also, for
certain consumer goods, push aside pure,
mostly long-term oriented, profitability con-
siderations. If a cost-benefit analysis leads to
a decision against the status quo, household
appliances and cars are generally purchased
new. In the case of residential property, the
prevailing options are converting or modern-
ising heating technology and improving insu-
lation.
If energy price rises are seen as permanent, in
the case of durable goods in particular it is
often better to buy a new product than to

34continue using the old product, because the
expected cost savings will be incurred
throughout the entire lifetime of the product.
Not only do space heating and mobility ac-
count for the majority of private energy con-
sumption, but heating and insulation technol-
ogy and cars alike both have a relatively long
service life; adjustment measures in these
areas are therefore particularly profitable.
Cost consciousness with respect to energyconsumption, moreover, has increased be-
cause space heating, warm water and house-
hold electricity prices, along with petrol and
diesel prices, have risen very sharply in the
past few years. Household energy prices rose
by just under 65% between 2000 and 2008,
with those for fuels and lubricants going up
by just over 42% during the same period.
Not only profitability considerations but also
the generally high sensitivity associated with
fuel price movements are likely reasons why a
visible demand shift has taken place in the
area of individual transport. For years already,
the percentage of diesel cars among privately
owned cars has been on the rise. One reason
is that pump prices for diesel in Germany
have usually been lower than those for regu-
lar petrol. In addition, diesel engines are more
efficient, which makes them an attractive op-
tion for drivers who cover a greater number
of kilometres, despite the somewhat higher
price tag and higher car taxes. It therefore
comes as no surprise that the trend towards
purchasing diesel cars is becoming more
prevalent if total kilometrage is used as the
benchmark as opposed to the number of ve-
hicles owned. Whereas cars with petrol en-
gines drove only a little over 10% fewer kilo-
metres in 2006 than in 2000, total kilometres
driven by privately owned diesel cars rose by
around 75% over the same period.
The rise in fuel prices, which was particularly
sharp in the period from mid-2007 to mid-
2008, as well as growing environmental
awareness, have apparently contributed to
the recent trend of attaching greater import-
ance to fuel consumption than to other ve-Fuel prices and new car

This is evidenced by the fact that, since2008, an above-average number of low-fuel-consumption cars have been registered,whereas new registrations of cars that con-sume a very large amount of fuel have fallenover the past two years. This trend is likely tocontinue since, following the adoption ofnew rules in early 2009, car taxes have beenassessed on the basis of emission classes andare thus pegged to fuel consumption. Thecurrently very high number of registrations inthe small and compact car categories, how-ever, is associated above all with the environ-mental premium being granted for the scrap-page of old cars; in this segment, this hasreduced the actual price paid for new carpurchases the most as a percentage of theprice tag.
Since peaking in 2000, household energy
consumption for space heating has fallenconsiderably – after adjustment fortemperature-related fluctuations – both inabsolute terms and relative to living space. Ifhouseholds do not wish to go without whatthey regard as a comfortable room tempera-ture in the cold months, one way to achievesavings is by fully utilising efficiency reservesin respect of temperature regulation. More-over, rising heating bills are motivating house-holds to place more value on the installationof energy-saving heating facilities and insula-tion in new buildings and on the conversionof older buildings. This type of building res-toration is currently being promoted by aKfW programme through low-interest loansand, since 2007, also through direct invest-ment grants. In the 2005-07 period, supportwas given to a total of 91,000 projects, there-

36focus of more and more attention. Economic
policy incentives in that direction have accel-
erated this trend. Changes in consumer
habits have repercussions on the business
sector because the assortment of goods and
services has to be modified.
Short-term quantitative effects on the
total supply of goods
The manufacture of goods and services gen-
erally requires energy; therefore, if this factor
of production becomes more expensive, this
can, in and of itself, impose an additional
cost burden on many firms. Options for
short-term adjustment are usually very limited
because manufacturing processes are prede-
termined and the available plant and machin-
ery, including their energy consumption func-
tions, are nearly impossible to alter. Labour
input can be manipulated to a limited extent
by using tools to increase flexibility, such as
working hours accounts, fixed-term employ-
ment contracts or temporary work; existing
wage contracts, however, constrain employ-
ers’ capacity to modify labour remuneration.
Passing on energy price-related cost pressure
to sales prices is likewise hardly viable in the
short term in many sectors. Under these cir-
cumstances, profit-maximising firms are often
forced to reduce energy consumption for cost
reasons by curbing production. This is coun-
tervailed to a degree by a partial substitution
effect inasmuch as earnings can be reinvested
in energy-efficient plant and machinery with-
in the regular capital turnover. However, this
means that the combination of inputs will
generally adjust only very slowly to thechanges in relative input prices, thereby
initially causing the negative scale effect to
predominate.
Another reason for reducing the supply of
goods is that high energy prices cause exist-
ing production facilities to become prema-
turely obsolescent – or, in economic terms, to
age faster – and therefore to be shut down or
at least not used as intensively as before for
efficiency reasons. Capital depreciation trig-
gered by cost pressures should be analytically
distinguished from demand-driven obsoles-
cence, which is caused by the fact that – as
explained in the preceding section – durable
consumer goods, but also energy-intensive
capital goods, can no longer be sold on the
market, or only in smaller quantities. This like-
wise causes production capacity to become
unprofitable. Theoretically, the value of the
manufacturing stock is already depreciated
the moment a permanent energy price shock
materialises; at the firm level, this leads to
extraordinary write-downs on fixed assets. In
the balance sheet, this is associated with a
loss of equity if compensatory measures are
not taken. Taken to its extreme, this can also
cause whole firms to exit the market, thereby
further shrinking the productive capital stock.
Capital depreciation and market adjustment
effects are virtually impossible to quantify at
the macro level. The empirical assessment of
the short-term supply effect of an energy
price shock is therefore focused on calculat-
ing the scale and substitution effects. The de-
cisive factor, however, is that substitution
possibilities generally do exist, yet can vary
from one economic sector to the next. TheEnergy cost-

37extent to which it is possible to reduce the
consumption of energy per unit of outputproduced by increasing the input of capitalgoods depends on the production structuresin the given sector and the availability oftechnologies. (See also the box on pages 38and 39.)
It is particularly those business sectors that ac-
count for a large percentage of commercialenergy use which are of interest in this article.This is true of the industrial and transport sec-tors, which accounted for 63% and 18% ofcommercial energy use on average over the1995-2007 period. The relative importance ofenergy as a factor of production in these sec-tors becomes clearer if these shares are as-sessed in the light of the fact that the indus-trial sector contributed around one-third, andtransport merely 5%, to the business sector’svalue added over the aforementionedperiod.
6
The effects on the supply of industrial goodsand the services rendered by the transportsector need to be quantified separately for avariety of reasons. One is that econometricstudies have shown that the elasticity of sub-stitution between capital and energy is muchhigher in industry than in transport.
7In both
sectors, though, the substitutability of thesefactors of production is relatively inelastic, es-pecially in the short term; with a given capitalstock, this trait, in isolation, indicates a com-paratively weak supply-side response to arelative change in factor prices. In addition,the effective price to be paid for using oneunit of energy varies depending on the sec-toral energy mix, since the individual sourcesof energy are subject to similar but not identi-
cal price trends, with time lags also playing arole. In the transport sector, fuels are a keyintermediate factor of production, with pet-roleum products accounting for more thanfour-fifths of the energy consumed in thissector.
8With a share of just under 30%, pet-
roleum was still the biggest individual item inindustrial energy consumption in 2007; how-ever, this figure also includes non-energyuses, which are particularly significant in thechemicals industry.
9Gas and electricity each
accounted for around one-fourth of use,while coal and lignite (including coal prod-ucts) contributed around one-sixth; the use ofrenewable energy made up less than 5% ofoverall industrial energy use. Moreover, thesupply effect on other sectors of the economycan vary in intensity depending on the sector.A decline in industrial production will affectnot only a number of business services pro-viders but also the transport sector, whichmeans an energy price surge will hit the latterdirectly and indirectly. Although it is also pos-sible that a primary shock in the transportsector could have a similar impact on other

manufacturing (excluding energy), retail trade, hotels

38Deutsche BundesbankA production function approach to modelling the supply effect of a permanent energy price shock
In production theory, energy is classified, de-
pending on sector and degree of aggregation,
as a factor of production and/or as output.
While own production of electricity and heat is
negligible in most economic sectors and energy
can thus be regarded uniquely as a factor of pro-
duction, energy sources are both inputs and out-
puts in the energy sector as well as in parts of
the mining industry, depending on the degree
of processing. Since heterogeneous products are
usually not modelled in a macroeconomic frame-
work, it makes sense to consider energy (under-
stood as primary energy consumption) as an
input factor only and adjust aggregate output
for primary and other types of energy produc-
tion. (Alternatively, one can consider only the
imported part of primary energy consumption
as an input factor.) This applies, in particular, to
countries such as Germany which import the
majority of their energy demand.
Output can be adjusted for energy components
relatively simply if one looks not at the total
economy, but at individual economic sectors – in
this case, the industrial and transport sectors,
which do not produce energy, barring any pro-
duction for their own needs. Under these cir-
cumstances, the production technology can gen-
erally be construed as a function of the form
Yt¼fðKt;Lt;Et;AtÞ, where Ytis output, Kt,Lt,
Etcapital, labour and energy respectively and At
technological progress.In contrast to the standard production function,
where the primary factors are capital and labour,
Ytcannot be represented here by an indicator of
value added (ie GDP in a total-economy analy-
sis), as this measurement concept, according to
the national accounts, includes only costs or
income incurred in connection with primary
inputs, while costs relating to energy use, as well
as the consumption of other intermediate
inputs, are deducted from real gross output.
Conceptually, the above production function is
consistent with an output indicator which, in
addition to value added, includes real expend-
iture on energy use.
The direct supply effect in the industrial and
transport sectors is derived using a production
structure which, in several respects, is more pre-
cise than the general form.1In order to repro-
duce central features of the neoclassical growth
model (eg the existence of a steady-state equi-
librium), the production function exhibits con-
stant returns to scale and labour-augmenting
technological progress. Furthermore, the pro-
duction structure is assumed to be nested in the
sense that, at a downstream stage, labour is
combined with an intermediate product Xt
which, at the upstream production stage, results
from the combination of capital and energy. Its
formula is

39While, at the end product stage, no other
assumptions have to be made regarding thefunctional form of the production technology,the volume and composition of the intermediateproduct (or capital-energy bundle) are deter-mined using a so-called CES function with thefollowing specification.

The substitutability between capital and energy
is described using (partial) elasticity of substitu-tion /C27¼ð1þ/C26Þ
/C01. The production function is
also characterised by the distribution parameterband the scale factor D.
In the event of an unforeseen energy price shock
which affects both the cost structure and cost-earnings relationship, the ability of firms toreact is generally a function of time. Since it isassumed that firms cannot change the prices ofthe intermediate and final product, nominalwages are settled and physical capital stock ispredetermined, the only adjustment strategyavailable to enterprises in the short term is toreduce their demand for energy. At the up-stream stage, profit-maximising firms combinethe factors in such a way as to use less energyper installed capital good, which in turn impliesthat, on the basis of the given stock of fixedassets, the volume of intermediate goods pro-duced falls. Excluding the possibility of labourhoarding, there is a corresponding drop in de-
mand for labour at the downstream stage, asthe real wage is fixed by construction.
Based on the percentage rise in energy prices,
the short-term volume effect on the supply ofgoods, including the impact of the resultingreduction in employment, can be approximatedusing the energy price elasticity "of the end
product, which takes the following form in thismodel.

It is interesting to note that the elasticity
depends not only on production technology, butalso, with the exception of the Cobb-Douglasproduction function ( /C26¼0), on the real energy
price level P

the price of the intermediate good. For plausibleparameter values, it is ceteris paribus – in abso-
lute terms – smaller, the more difficult it is tosubstitute capital for energy. By contrast, abso-lute elasticity increases in line with the weightof energy in the production process.
It should be noted in general that the results
presented here are not based on the concept ofa steady-state equilibrium, in which all factors ofproduction have completely adjusted to the newprice relationships.

40sectors of the economy, this is quite difficult
to prove empirically.10
The starting point for assessing the short-
term effect on the supply of goods in the
economy is the effective energy price in-
crease, estimated to have been 64% in the
industrial sector and 75% in the transport
sector over the 2004-08 period. Whereas,
among industrial firms, the increase in the
price of this factor of production during this
period is quite comparable with the oil price
shocks in the 1970s, carriers shouldered a
considerably heavier cost burden over the
period under review. Apart from the fact that
the pronounced wage moderation of the past
had made it possible to offset at least some
of the additional energy costs internally, the
extent and the length of the increases indi-
cate that there may have been lagged and
partial price pass-through, for which the
empirical study adjusts.
Assuming a given capital stock, ie excluding
obsolescence, but with labour fully adjusted
to a new quantity of output, model estimates
show that the industrial sector could have re-
duced its supply of goods by a total of 33/C254%
between 2004 and 2008 owing to the add-
itional cost burden imposed by that part of
the energy price increase which is deemed
permanent. Although at 2% the direct supply
effect was much lower in the transport sec-
tor, it must also be noted for this sector that

41of industrial goods is associated with a reduc-
tion in the volume of transport services ofaround 2
1/C254%. In the rest of the business sec-
tor, the reduced supply of industrial goods ledto a loss in value added of around 1
1/C254%.
Taking these effects together, the strong risesin energy prices over the 2004-08 perioddampened the growth of the overall econo-my’s supply of goods by an estimated 1
1/C254%
throughout the period under review or by anaverage of
1/C254% per year.
The calculations rest on the assumption of
complete adjustment of labour input to thereduction in output caused by higher energyprices.
11This is justifiable because it is the
isolated effect of higher energy prices on thesupply of goods which is at the centre ofinterest here. Therefore, impacts emanatingfrom a weaker or lagged reaction of labourwhich cushion the negative impact on firms’labour demand over the short term throughreal wage reductions are neglected. However,one must not overlook the fact that it is espe-cially these responses by labour marketagents which help determine the overall ad-justment record from the point of view ofmacroeconomic stability. If, for instance, therelevant adjustments in real wages meantthat it was not necessary to reduce labourdemand, the energy price rises would havehad a much softer output effect.
When interpreting the model results, two
things should be borne in mind. First, the cal-culations are fraught with a great deal of esti-mation uncertainty. Second, the outcome ismerely a computational quantity which influ-ences the supply side of the economy underthe conditions of average capacity utilisation;
however, it is not necessarily reflected in theactual level of economic activity. The energyprice increases in the previous years occurredduring a phase of pronounced global eco-nomic expansion which promoted demandfor German goods and services and led toperceptible economic growth in Germany.
The discovery of a dampening effect on the
supply in the economy is therefore more likelyto be consistent with the observation thatfirms sought to cover the brisk demand to agreater extent through primarily temporarymeasures to boost production. One indicatorCumulative supply effects of the

42is that capacity utilisation in the industrial sec-
tor stood at an extraordinarily high level for
around two years up until mid-2008 and that
the backlog of orders ballooned. Another fact
is that, during the boom years, firms were
very active in taking advantage of the new
flexibility in the use of labour input and of the
option to lease machinery, vehicles and other
equipment, which indicates that they were
hesitant to some degree about adjusting their
own production capacity to past demand.
Compared to the hypothetical scenario with-
out supply-side effects, actual total capacity
utilisation was therefore higher owing to the
dynamic growth of the world economy.
Longer-term growth effects and the role
of economic and wage-setting policy
The negative supply effects explained above
do not necessarily have to be permanent.
One of the keys to answering the question of
whether an economy can sustain a perman-
ent increase in the price of energy consump-
tion over the longer term without sacrificing
potential output growth is the ability to adapt
the product range to changes in the demand
structure; the other lies in possibilities of pro-
viding sustained cost relief. This can be ac-
complished by changing over to energy
sources that are better priced over the long
term. In addition, either technology can be
used to enhance efficiency or energy con-
sumption can be substituted by other factors
of production, thereby reducing the energy
intensity. In the 1970s and 1980s, the indus-
trial sector succeeded in reducing the abso-
lute use of energy despite a distinct increasein the productive capital stock. Since the mid-
1990s – as was the case in the transport sec-
tor from 1970 throughout the observation
period – there has been no perceptible reduc-
tion in the amount of energy used per unit of
capital. In turn, though, the industrial and
transport sectors’ energy mix has improved
over the past ten years. There was a moder-
ate reduction in the use of fossil fuels such as
crude oil, natural gas and coal, whereas the
percentage share accounted for by renewable
sources of energy after 1995 made a small,
but no longer negligible, contribution.
The increased use of hydropower, wind en-
ergy and solar energy, as well as biomass, ex-
emplify the fact that new types of energy ex-
traction can find their place in the commercial
energy mix. Further research into renewable
sources of energy, as well as the development
of resource-saving capital goods, are neces-
sary conditions for providing firms with new
technologies as alternatives to the status quo.
However, for a changeover to actually occur,
not only must the investment be profitable in
and of itself, but sufficient funding must also
be available. Also, it must be noted that the
energy balance of a production facility is rare-
ly seen in isolation but is instead important as
a sub-element in the overall context of a deci-
sion as to whether or not to invest. Since re-
placement purchases and capacity expansion
are usually associated with implementing
higher technological standards, a generally
favourable investment climate is key to the
rapid proliferation of these standards and
thus to the quick reduction of commercial
energy consumption.Longer-term

43In this context, wage-setting policy assumes a
key role for several reasons. What must beavoided is a situation in which increased costsof living lead to compensation in terms ofwages, even if consumer prices go up in thewake of higher energy prices. However, evenstable real labour costs mean a shift in thedistribution of income among the primaryfactors of production if energy costs increase.This is not the only issue that needs to betaken into consideration when settingemployment-oriented wage policy. In add-ition, although the increased use of capital tosave energy can reduce the energy intensity,and thus the real income losses caused by theterms of trade, this diversion of capital usuallydetracts from the possibility of otherwise im-proving labour productivity. A similar effectensues if an energy price shock virtually de-values part of the existing physical capitalstock, thereby causing it to exit the produc-tion process prematurely.
Experience from the 1970s and 1980s shows
that wage-setting policy which does not takedue account of these factors not only createssecond-round effects on inflation and har-bours the risk of an expectation-driven wage-price spiral but also entails adverse output ef-fects on top of the primary growth lossesthrough the energy price rise. At the time,high wage growth, through sharply risingunit wage costs, had imposed an additionalsevere cost burden on firms which subse-quently resulted in reduced capital formation,flatter medium-term growth and higher un-employment.
12In the 2004-08 period, by
contrast, the underlying trend towards wagemoderation that had taken hold in the mid-1990s continued, despite the considerable in-
crease in consumer energy prices. Germanfirms’ sales prices for industrial goods andtransport services remained virtually un-changed, thereby strengthening their relativeposition in an increasingly globalised market.Moreover, there was enough scope at thisstage to grow returns on non-financial cap-ital, causing Germany to become increasinglyattractive as a production location.

44conflict over income distribution do not damp-
en the outlook for longer-term price develop-
ments. In this context, it is key that inflation
expectations remain firmly anchored. Monet-
ary policy, however, must also give due con-
sideration to negative supply effects in the
real economy, as they reduce the scope for
unfettered economic growth. Experience
from the 1970s shows that, at least in this re-
gard, there is undoubtedly the danger of an
overly optimistic view of potential output.14
Owing to the generally favourable price cli-
mate and the basic wage trend, there is cur-
rently a very good chance that the German
economy will weather the rise in energy
prices without protracted damage to poten-
tial output growth. The welfare losses would
then be initially confined to the transfer of
real income and the capital depreciation
effect that is directly associated with the rela-
tive factor price shock in the form of higher
prices for imported energy.In a global view, it is also significant that this
phenomenon represents a broadly based in-
come distribution effect that is virtually
worldwide. Should German exporters suc-
ceed, as in the past, in acquiring a larger-
than-average share in the generally large de-
mand for high-end capital and consumer
goods among energy commodity exporters,
the negative implications for the economy’s
income level in Germany would be confined
to a reasonable extent. Another positive fac-
tor is that, in Germany, not only is there a
broad range of new environmental technolo-
gies on offer, but these have already become
quite advanced in terms of practical use. In
this area, the German economy is likewise
internationally very competitive.

45The development and
determinants of euro
currency in circulation
in GermanyThe issuance of banknotes and coins in
Germany has undergone very dynamic
growth since the euro cash change-
over. This sharp increase, however, has
less to do with a higher domestic de-
mand for banknotes and coins to be
used in payments than with an in-
creased holding of cash as a means of
storing value and with a stronger de-
mand for euro cash on the part of non-
residents. For statistical reasons, it is
not possible to make an exact assess-
ment of how much of the cash issued
in Germany is held by non-residents. It
is estimated that between 25% and
35% of the euro banknotes issued (net)
in Germany are now located in other
countries. This is due, among other
things, to Germany’s central geograph-
ical position in Europe and its tradition-
ally strong involvement in the inter-
national wholesale banknote market.
Holding cash as a store of value is also
a key motive. This became apparent es-
pecially in the autumn of 2008 when
there was a strong demand, above all,
for the large denominations both in
Germany and internationally. Looking
ahead, despite declining growth rates,
there is likely to be a continuing trend
rise in currency in circulation.

in Germany
Following the euro cash changeover in 2002,

DEUTSCHE
BUNDESBANK
EUROSYSTEM
Monthly Report
June 2009
46throughout the euro area increased from
3221 billion initially to 3763 billion at the end
of 2008. During the same period, the volume
of banknotes in circulation in Germany grew
from 373 billion to 3328 billion.1Conse-
quently, banknotes issued in Germany as a
share of the total volume issued by the Euro-
system went up from 33% to 43%. This
growth was accompanied by a greater
demand for higher denominations. Thus, the
average value of the banknotes issued in Ger-
many rose from just under 332 at the begin-
ning of 2002 to roughly 348 in 2008.
This growth in cash issued in Germany took
place despite the increasing options to
replace cash payments with other forms of
payment. Owing to the increasing number of
outlets accepting card payments and as a
result of technological innovations, there has
been a steady decline over the past few years
in the percentage of cash payments in Ger-
man retail sales. The enormous growth in the
volume of banknotes in circulation in Ger-
many during the first few years following the
launch of the euro is therefore unlikely to be
due primarily to an increased need for pay-
ment purposes but rather to other factors.
These include, above all, the replenishment of
stocks of cash inside and outside the euro
area owing to the euro cash changeover. Fol-
lowing this process, which is likely to have
been a factor chiefly in the first few years of
monetary union, the annual growth rates up
to and including September 2008 slowly but
steadily declined to what was still a consider-
able 10.3% in Germany and 7.3% in the
Eurosystem as a whole. At the end of 2008,
however, the financial market crisis led to asudden rise in the growth rates again to
15.9% and 12.7% respectively.
The pace of growth in the volume of German
euro banknotes in circulation is very much
faster than could have been expected on the
basis of earlier growth rates for D-Mark cur-
rency (see chart on page 48). This rapid
growth is due, not least, to demand from
non-euro-area countries. Earlier, the D-Mark
was used as a reserve currency by a number
of these countries and such stocks have now
been changed over to euro. Furthermore,
owing to its large currency area, the euro is
an attractive reserve currency. It may be as-
sumed that the euro is now preferred by
some market participants that used non-
European reserve currencies prior to the
launch of the euro.
Dividing the issuance of cash into banknotes
and coins, it is striking that the value of euro
coins issued in the euro area since the intro-
duction of the single currency in 2002 has
increased at a slower pace than the value of
the banknotes in circulation. This is also the
case for Germany.Sharp rise
in banknotes
in circulation
1When analysing the volume of cash in circulation in
Germany, it should be noted that it is not possible to pro-
vide precise statistical data on currency in circulation do-
mestically. This is due, in particular, to migration effects
between countries (for example, as a result of inter-
national currency trading, tourism, and cash taken abroad
by employees to their home countries). These are not
captured or are captured only partially by the statistics
and can therefore only be estimated. Hence, whenever
reference is made in the text to “German cash in circula-
tion” or “volume of cash in circulation in Germany” etc,
this relates to the volume resulting from the difference
between inpayments and outpayments at the Deutsche
Bundesbank (net issuance). In the statistical section of
the Deutsche Bundesbank’s Monthly Report, the volume
of banknotes in circulation is calculated in a different way
because the banknotes in circulation are shown in
accordance with the accounting rules of the Eurosystem.Declining

47In the period 2002-03, the value of the issued
euro coins initially showed a sharp rise. By the
end of 2002, the Eurosystem had brought
coins to the value of around 312.4 billion into
circulation. Germany accounted for 33.6 bil-
lion of this. In the following year, too, both
Germany (+16.3%) and the euro area as a
whole (+13.5%) recorded double-digit
growth rates. Since 2004, there has been a
trend decline in the annual growth rates; in
2008, they were still at 4.9% in Germany and
5.7% in the euro area as a whole.
Determinants of euro banknote
circulation in Germany
The rapid and persistent pace of growth in
the volume of banknotes in circulation gives
rise to the question of the reasons for this
development. The motives behind the de-
mand for cash and the part it plays in German
banknote circulation will be investigated
below. The key determinants of the demand
for currency in this context are the trans-
actions motive, demand from non-residents,
and the desire to have a liquid medium for
storing value.
Cash held for transaction purposes
Domestic transaction balances, as a compon-
ent of German banknote circulation, com-
prises cash held for buying goods and
services, which therefore has a direct relation-
ship with transactions in the real economy.
Cash used for transaction purposes circulates
in the economy. The Bundesbank plays a key
role in this cycle. Put simply, the commercialVolume of euro banknotes

48banks receive banknotes from the Bundes-
bank. They then use these banknotes to fill
their ATMs and cash desks. This cash is with-
drawn by consumers. After a while, it finds its
way into the cash boxes of retailers and ser-
vice providers. Finally, for cost and security
reasons, businesses pay it into the Bundes-
bank as soon as possible, often via one of the
commercial banks.
A representative survey on “Payment behav-
iour in Germany”, which was conducted
among the general public on behalf of the
Bundesbank in 2008, showed that roughly
58% of all the transactions covered were
paid in cash and only 26% with a debit card.2
Cash is therefore still the dominant means of
payment in Germany.Nevertheless, the percentage of cash pay-
ments in retail sales has been falling for some
years. It is uncertain, however, whether the
observed decline in the share of cash pay-
ments3will also continue to the same extent
in the future. On the one hand, the number
of outlets accepting card payments has al-
ready reached a high level. Payment habits
appear to be changing only slowly, too.4,5On
the other hand, as time passes, those mem-
bers of the general public who have grown
up with alternative forms of payment and
who are likely to go on using them until they
reach an old age will constitute an ever great-
er percentage of the overall population. In
view of this development, there could be a
further, albeit – given unchanged underlying
conditions – rather modest decline in the per-
centage of cash payments in the medium to
long term. Furthermore, it remains to be seen
whether new, innovative technologies, such
as contactless payment by card or payment
by fingerprint recognition will gain hold in
Germany and what payment instruments
they might replace.DM/euro banknotes in

49No statistics are available on the exact per-
centage of banknotes held on average in Ger-many as transaction balances. This thereforehas to be estimated. To do this, the banknotestocks of banks, of the general public as wellas of retailers and service providers have to beapproximated.
6The stocks of banknotes held
by banks for transaction purposes may be cal-culated from the stocks in ATMs and cashdesks. In 2008, these amounted on averageto some 314.5 billion.
7The stock of bank-
notes held by the general public to pay forgoods and services may be derived from theaforementioned Bundesbank survey on pay-ment behaviour in Germany, in which personsaged 18 years or over were asked how muchthey withdrew on average from an ATM or atthe bank counter and how much cash theyhave left over before their next withdrawal.Assuming a linear reduction in the amountwithdrawn until the next withdrawal, ex-trapolation of the data yielded an averagestock of cash amounting to roughly 314.4 bil-
lion held for transactions purposes by thegeneral public aged 18 or over.
8Using a num-
ber of simplified assumptions, banknote hold-ings of retailers and service providers, as cal-culated from the figures available for sales inthe sector for 2007, resulted in a transactioncash stock of about 32.1 billion.
9
These calculations thus yield a volume of
banknotes in circulation for transaction pur-poses in Germany averaging approximately331 billion, which corresponds to roughly
10% of the banknotes in circulation in Ger-many as at the end of 2008.
10This shows
clearly that the transaction motive is of rela-tively minor importance for the overall cashdemand in Germany and scarcely played a
part in the observed sharp rise in the volumeof banknotes in circulation.
Cash demand from non-residentsThere are various reasons why euro bank-
notes issued in Germany find their way toother countries. For example, a large numberof foreign workers sending money back totheir home country, close trading and finan-cial links with other countries along withtourism lead to an outflow of euro banknotesto other countries. Furthermore, demand foreuro banknotes from countries outside theeuro area can be due to comparatively lessfavourable stability-oriented developments inthe countries concerned. Non-residents’ de-mand for euro banknotes also depends ongeographical distance. Even before the intro-duction of the euro, countries in east andsouth-east Europe used the D-Mark as areserve currency. Bundesbank estimates as-sumed that, in the mid-1990s, between 30%and 40% of D-Mark banknotes were in circu-

8Based on these assumptions, average cash holdings are
composed of one half of the amount withdrawn plus re-
sidual cash holdings. Furthermore, it is assumed that the
amounts of cash which are typically withdrawn are also
spent between two consecutive withdrawals and are not
hoarded. See W Baumol (1952), The Transactions De-
mand for Cash: An Inventory Theoretic Approach, Quar-
terly Journal of Economics, Vol. 66, pp 545-556. Amount

include cash held by enterprises for consumption and

50lation outside Germany, especially in east and
south-east Europe.11After the D-Mark was
subsumed in the euro, the new single cur-
rency more than took over the former’s role
as a transaction currency and store of value in
many countries outside the euro area.
Owing to the fact that payments are un-
restricted, it is not possible to make an exact
calculation or survey of the volume of Ger-
man euro banknotes in circulation outside
Germany.12In order to perform at least a
rough estimation of the volume of cash in cir-
culation outside the euro area, use is first
made of the net shipments of euro banknotes
to countries outside the euro area reported
by the credit institutions.13The cumulative
net shipments from Germany make it clear
that demand from non-residents outside theeuro area is a key driver of the growth in the
volume of currency issued in Germany.
By the end of 2008, the value of the cumula-
tive net shipments from Germany to coun-
tries outside the euro area had risen to
around 387 billion. This means that bank-
notes in circulation outside the euro area as a
percentage of German banknotes in circula-
tion had increased from 14% to 26% since
the end of 2002. Nevertheless, it should be
borne in mind that banknote migration is not
captured completely by the recorded net out-
payments abroad via banks because bank-
notes also find their way abroad from Ger-
many in other ways, such as tourism or
money sent home by foreign workers.
Assuming that this outflow from Germany is
accompanied by a much smaller return flow
from abroad, the cited figure would, in fact,
have to be revised upwards.14Under these
assumptions, net banknote demand from
non-euro-area countries could have gone up
by the end of 2008 to between 25% and
35% of the volume of banknotes issued in
Germany, thus playing a considerable part in
its growth.

the end of 2007 estimated the net volume ofNet shipments of euro

15The fact that the figure is lower than
for Germany can be explained by Germany’sstrong involvement in the internationalwholesale banknote market. First, ever sincethe D-Mark era, German credit institutionshave had close links with countries where theeuro is now widely used, especially in eastand south-east Europe.
16Second, a major
role is played by Germany’s central geograph-ical location in Europe.
Demand for currency because it is a store
of value: hoarding
Hoarding may be characterised essentially as
the holding of currency as a store of value.On grounds of efficiency, high-denominationbanknotes are most likely to be used for thispurpose. The associated costs – such as for-going interest income, the costs of storage ina locker, and the risk of loss – actually argueagainst saving in the form of cash. Neverthe-less, there are reasons for keeping money incash. For instance, cash is the asset with thehighest degree of liquidity, which is importantespecially in times of heightened uncertainty.There was, for example, a sharp rise in thedemand for cash during the financial crisis inOctober 2008.
The very sharp increase in the volume of
banknotes in circulation in Germany duringthe first few years after the launch of theeuro is closely connected with the liquidationof the D-Mark hoards in the run-up to thecash changeover. This is suggested by devel-opments in the circulation of D-Mark andeuro banknotes, which point to a reduction in
D-Mark cash holdings and a subsequentbuild-up of cash holdings in euro. This pro-cess lasted roughly until the end of 2003.After stocks of currency had been replenishedowing to the euro cash changeover, bank-note issuance in Germany was still muchmore dynamic than in the D-Mark era, how-ever. The continuing strong growth in thelarge denominations (with the exception ofthe3200 banknote) suggests that the “store
of value” motive was of major importance inthis respect, too. Moreover, the underlyingconditions in Germany during the past fewyears also support the assumption that thedemand for cash has grown for “store ofvalue” motives. Interest and inflation rateswhich, by historical standards, were extreme-ly low following the introduction of the eurocontributed to a decline in the opportunitycost of holding cash and thus encouraged thebuild-up of hoarded currency.
17
Owing to its anonymous character, cash canalso be held for illegal motives, however.Even so, currency held or used for dishonestpurposes is not only hoarded but is also partof cash balances, for example, in the blackeconomy or in drug dealing.

The sensitivity of the subject and the explicitdesire for anonymity – which by no meansnecessarily has any connection with illegalmotives – means that determining the stocks

52Deuts che Bun desbankDeman d for banknotes durin g the ﬁ  nan cial crisis 
As a result of the es calation of the ﬁ  nan cial market 
crisis in the autumn of 2008, the deman d for banknotes 
and coins differe d marke dly from its pattern o bserve d 
earlier. Between weeks 39 an d 43 of 2008, the balan ce 
of inpayments an d outpayments at the Bun desbank was 
noti ceably different from that of the previous year. 
Balan ce of inpayments an d outpayments 
As a rule, it is possi ble to discern a cyclical pattern in 
inpayments an d outpayments over the course of the 
week. At the start of the week, inpayments pre domin-
ate at the central bank. These ori ginate mainly from 
retailers an d are the result of consumer spen ding from 
the pre ceding weeken d. As the week pro gresses, this 
inpayment surplus turns into an outpayment surplus. The in crease in outpayments at the en d of the week is 
use d by the commer cial banks primarily to ﬁ  ll ATMs. 
The en d of Septem ber an d early O ctober 2008 saw an 
increase in deman d for banknotes an d coins compare d 
with the previous year an d a temporary chan ge in the 
weekly pattern of daily inpayments an d outpayments. 
Deman d for banknotes an d coins did not return to 
normal a gain until 24 O ctober 2008, whi ch was the ﬁ  rst 
time that the outpayment balan ce was smaller than 
that for the same perio d one year earlier (see a djacent 
chart). 
Daily outpayments in O ctober 2008 were lar gely at a 
level compara ble to the hi gh deman d for cash in the 
perio d before Christmas. What was strikin g was that 
the enormous in crease in the value of outpayments 
was not offset by hi gher inpayments. For example, on 
10 O ctober 2008 – the day with the hi ghest volume of 
outpayments durin g the ﬁ  nan cial crisis (€4.2 billion) 
– re corded inpayments merely stoo d at €1.5 billion. 
Overall, there were lar ge value outpayments over a 
len gthy perio d in O ctober 2008, whereas inpayments 
remaine d relatively sta ble compare d with the previous 
year’s ﬁ  gures. 
Parti cular deman d for hi gh denominations 
Durin g the ﬁ  nan cial crisis, lar ge denominations, whi ch 
are espe cially suita ble as a store of value, were in mu ch 
greater deman d than me dium an d small denominat-
ions. For example, a sli ght in crease in deman d, par-
ticularly for €500 banknotes, was alrea dy apparent in 
Septem ber 2008. In O ctober, there was a hu ge rise in 
net outpayments in this denomination an d deman d did

€500 banknotes generally a ccount for a very lar ge 
share of the cash outﬂ  ows in the international whole-
sale banknote market. Hen ce, there is reason to believe 
that, in this case too, some of these banknotes ﬂ  owe d 
to non-euro-area countries as a result of the hi gh 
outpayments of this denomination durin g the ﬁ  nan cial 
crisis. In or der to determine this external deman d more 
pre cisely, the a ccount movements on a ccounts hel d by 
forei gn banks at the Bun desbank an d banks en gaging 
in export business were analyse d, with a consi dera ble 
per centa ge of these a ccount movements pro bably 
use d to supply forei gn credit institutions with cash.1 
The transa ctions con ducted on these a ccounts are 
interprete d as external deman d; if these amounts are 
deducted from outpayments as a whole, the resi dual 
ﬁ gure that is o btaine d represents domesti c deman d. As 
can be seen from the a djacent chart, domesti c deman d 
for €500 banknotes in the thir d quarter of 2008 was still 
higher than the deman d from non-resi dents. In O cto-
ber, outpayments were then distri bute d almost evenly 
between deman d from resi dents an d non-resi dents. 
This shows that, durin g the ﬁ  nan cial crisis, deman d for

rose equally in Germany an d abroa d.Banknote outpayments

54of hoarded banknotes in Germany on the
basis of a direct survey of the general public
does not produce robust results. Ultimately,
only the residual produced by the volume of
banknotes in circulation in Germany after
subtracting transaction balances and demand
from non-residents can be used as a rough
estimate. Assuming a holding of transaction
balances amounting to 10% of the volume of
banknotes in circulation and based on a de-
mand from non-residents amounting to be-
tween 25% and 35%, the lion’s share of
55% to 66% is left over for hoarding. Such
figures are subject to a great deal of uncer-
tainty since they are calculated as residuals
and the transaction and non-resident per-
centages can only be estimated, too.Owing to these problems, the Bundesbank
survey on “payment behaviour in Germany”
attempted to capture indirectly the German
general public’s propensity to hoard. Specify-
ing various response options, it was asked
how major expenditure items, such as large
purchases, were settled. In response to this
question, it was stated by 22% of all those
surveyed that they were able to draw on cash
reserves. This may be interpreted as an indica-
tion of the widespread existence of hoarded
stocks of cash in Germany, even though it is
not possible to estimate their volume. The
results of the study show that holding cash
in this way is more prevalent among older
members of the general public than among
younger ones. By contrast, a breakdown by
other socio-demographic factors, such as in-
come or social background, failed to reveal
any significant differences.
The fact that the holding of cash, as observed
in the study, is more prevalent among persons
aged 45 or over might be due in part to this
age group possessing higher-than-average
assets and therefore holding more of this
wealth as cash. Furthermore, there is a dis-
tinct possibility that the older age groups in
particular – not least because of their person-
al experience of crises – hold a larger part of
their savings in the form of cash.
Although hoarding and demand from non-
residents were analysed separately for meth-
odological reasons, it is difficult to separate
these two motives of cash demand in
practice. Theoretically, demand from non-
residents could be split even more accurately
into “non-residents’ transactions balances”Settlement of major

55and “non-residents’ cash hoarding”. Precisely
given the large percentage of hoarded items
in the volume of German banknotes in circu-
lation – which was calculated as a residual – it
remains unclear how much of this may be
hoarded or used for other purposes by non-
residents and therefore ought to be added to
the non-resident volume in circulation.
Taking all of the above factors into consider-
ation, domestic hoarding and demand from
non-residents combined account for 90% of
the volume of banknotes in circulation. The
experience of the euro cash changeover sug-
gests that this figure is not implausible. The
volume of banknotes in circulation peaked as
early as the end of 1999 – two years before
the introduction of euro banknotes and
coins. By the end of 2001, the figures for
banknote circulation had fallen by 45%.
These stocks were evidently not needed for
transaction purposes. Rather, domestic and
non-residents’ hoards of cash were liquid-
ated. During the first nine days of 2002, the
volume of D-Mark banknotes in circulation
declined by a further 21% compared with its
peak in late 1999. Very early in 2002, more
than 90% of domestic cash payments were
being made in euro.19In other words, the
decline in D-Mark banknotes in circulation in
the first few days of January 2002 means the
majority of domestic cash balances had
already been converted to euro. The ensuing
fall in D-Mark in circulation can therefore be
attributed more to hoards of cash being
liquidated or to inpayments from non-resi-
dents. Finally, it should be noted that D-Mark
banknotes to the value of DM 6.8 billion
were still outstanding at the end of 2008.A considerable part of these may be regarded
as hoarded permanently or lost.
Determinants of euro coin circulation
in Germany
The volume of coins in circulation depends
mainly on transaction balances and hoarding;
demand from non-residents plays a much
smaller role than in banknote circulation.20
Owing to the low amounts involved, coins
are not hoarded so much as a store of value.
In addition to saving in the classical sense
(money boxes, for example), coin collecting is
significant to a certain extent. Finally, many
coins which have been lost over the years are
also recorded as part of the volume of coins
in circulation.
The euro cash changeover provides some
clues about the breakdown of the volume of
coins in circulation in terms of the purposes
for which they are used. Many D-Mark coins
that were being hoarded temporarily were
liquidated either in the run-up to or immedi-
ately after the euro cash changeover by being
paid into a bank account. As a result, during
the course of 2001, the volume of coins in
circulation fell from roughly DM 16 billion to
DM 12.5 billion, ie by 22%.21It should also
be noted that, at the end of 2008, D-Mark
coins worth DM 7 billion had still not been ex-

21The volume of coins in circulation did not peak until
the end of 2000 – not the end of 1999 as in the case of
banknotes.

56Deuts che Bun desbankEconometri c stru ctural mo del of banknote deman d 
The contri bution ma de by various determinants to the volume 
of banknotes in circulation can be capture d in e conometri c 
 mo dels. For this purpose, the Bun desbank has develope d a 
stru ctural mo del (ve ctor error corre ction mo del). The estima-
tion perio d for this mo del is from the beginnin g of 1991 to the 
end of 2007. Seasonally a djuste d quarterly data are use d. The 
sele cted mo del makes it possi ble to analyse both the lon g-term 
equili brium relationships ( cointe gration relationships) an d the 
short-term dynami cs. The latter are the ﬂ  uctuations in deman d 
for the respe ctive cash components aroun d the lon g-term equi-
librium values. The estimation takes pla ce in real terms, whi ch 
implies that the cash hol ders gear their deman d for banknotes 
to their pur chasin g power. However, in prin ciple, a short-term 
deviation from this assume d behaviour is permitte d. The deman d for smaller, me dium an d lar ge denominations is investi-
gate d. Bank note denominations of €5 to €20 as well as of DM5 
to DM50 are classiﬁ  ed as “small“, those of €50 an d €100 as well 
as of DM100 an d DM200 are classiﬁ  ed as “me dium“, an d the 
two hi ghest-value banknotes of €200 an d €500 as well as DM500 
and DM1,000 are classiﬁ  ed as “lar ge“.1 See the a djacent chart.2
In or der to take due a ccount of the spe cial circumstan ces for the 
perio d of the euro cash chan geover, differently spe ciﬁ ed dummy 
varia bles are in corporate d into the estimation approa ch.
Cash consumption is counte d amon g the determinants of cash 
deman d. Cash consumption is consi dere d to be those su bcat-
egories of private consumption that are lar gely settle d in cash.3 
The opportunity cost of hol ding cash is taken into a ccount 
via the interest rate level. The complete interest rate ran ge is 
incorporate d into the analysis, as a shift parameter from an 
estimate d yiel d curve is in cluded to represent the generally pre-
vailin g interest rate level. An in crease in this parameter means 
that it shifts the entire interest rate ran ge upwar ds. Motives of 
deman d from non-resi dents are inte grate d into the respe ctive 
estimates usin g a variety of varia bles. Deman d from non-euro-
area countries for banknotes issue d in Germany is capture d 
via an ex chan ge rate ar gument. An appre ciation of the euro 
shoul d make it more attra ctive as a store of value an d shoul d 
therefore be a ccompanie d by a hi gher deman d for euro cur-
ren cy in non-euro-area countries. The best results were a chieve d 
with the real effe ctive external value of the euro vis-à-vis the 
22 most important tra ding partners. External fa ctors inﬂ  uen cing 
developments in euro-area countries ex cluding Germany were 
taken into a ccount via house pri ces an d private consumption. 
The BIS housin g pri ce in dicator for the euro area, whose dynam-
ics are determine d solely by developments outsi de Germany, 
was chosen as the varia ble for the house pri ces. This is likely to 
be a goo d proxy for the preferen ce for cash payments, as real 
property pur chases are often ma de in cash. Private consump-
tion mo dels the transa ction balan ces.4 The possi ble impa ct of 
the sha dow e conomy on cash deman d was capture d via an 
estimate d share of this area in gross domesti c pro duct.5 Finally, 
the unemployment rate in Germany was also taken into a ccount 
as a varia ble for explainin g transa ctions in lar ge denominations. 
With in creasin g unemployment, there is a growin g incentive to 
move e conomi c activities to the sha dow e conomy by means of 
illicit work. This, in turn, lea ds to a rise in the deman d for cash in 
the form of lar ge denominations. Alternative payment metho ds 
as a su bstitute for cash payments are in corporate d into the esti-
mation equations via the num ber of settle d card payments.

57The ta ble below shows the estimation results, broken down 
into short an d lon g-term determinants an d the three groups of 
banknotes.
In the case of the small an d me dium denominations, what 
stan ds out in the result is an o bvious impa ct of the transa ction 
volume in Germany, capture d via cash consumption.6 The lar ge 
denominations, by contrast, appear to be unaffe cted by this. In 
their case, however, non-resi dent motives are important: ﬁ  rst, 
via a lon g-term impa ct of the house pri ces in the euro area, 
whose dynami cs are determine d mainly by the real estate mar-
ket outsi de Germany, an d se con d, via private consumption in 
the euro area ex cluding Germany. The importan ce of German 
transa ctions in terms of the deman d for lar ge denominations 
is noti ceable, at most, in the short-term impa ct of unemploy-
ment. A dditionally, deman d from non-euro-area countries is 
important in the lon g term for all denominations. Moreover, an 
inﬂ uen ce of the sha dow e conomy 7 on banknote deman d can-
not be rule d out for any of the three banknote cate gories. In the 
case of the small denominations, the effe ct can be seen dire ctly 
in the short-term inﬂ  uen ce of the sha dow e conomy‘s share of 
GDP. In the two other cate gories, the sha dow e conomy coul d be reﬂ ected in dire ctly in the house pri ce an d unemployment vari-
ables. Finally, opportunity costs in the form of the interest rate 
level seem to be of relevan ce only for the small denominations. 
Alternative means of payment, too, evi dently inﬂ  uen ce only the 
small denominations. Alternative payment me dia determine the 
ﬂ uctuations aroun d the lon g-term equili brium, whi ch is deﬁ ne d 
by cash consumption, deman d from non-resi dents, an d interest 
rates. The cash chan geover dummies show a hi ghly si gniﬁ cant 
inﬂ uen ce in all the spe ciﬁ cations. 
The a djustment to the lon g-term equili brium is reﬂ  ected in the 
error corre ction term. This term states how mu ch of an exist-
ing disequili brium is re duced within one quarter. It is o bvious 
that the amount of time in whi ch this a djustment takes pla ce 
varies depen ding on the denomination. It is shortest for the 
small denominations an d lon gest for the hi gh denominations. 
In the case of the latter, 40 % of the im balan ce is corre cted in 
one quarter. The hi ghly si gniﬁ cant error corre ction terms in all 
the equations in dicate that the respe ctive lon g-term relation-
ships a ctually constitute a banknote deman d fun ction.8 The test

58changed for euro. That corresponds to almost
44% of the volume of D-Mark coins in circu-
lation at the end of 2000. It is very likely that
most of these coins are permanently lost or
form part of permanent collections. As a
residual for determining transaction balances,
this gives a share of roughly one-third of the
coins in circulation, which is a figure roughly
comparable to those in earlier studies on the
volume of coins in circulation.22Accordingly,
prior to the adoption of the euro, some 30%
to 40% of the volume of D-Mark coins in cir-
culation could be attributed to transaction
balances, roughly 40% were to be regarded
as lost or permanently hoarded, and 20% to
30% were stored in temporary hoards. As a
result of the euro cash changeover, this pic-
ture changed at first. Immediately after theintroduction of euro coins, the transaction
motive was predominant in the demand for
coins. One major reason for the sharp in-
crease in the volume of coins in circulation
from 2003 onwards, however, was the grad-
ual replenishment of hoarded stocks of coins.
This is indicated, not least, by the fact that al-
most two-thirds of the growth in 2003 was in
coins of lower nominal values. In the follow-
ing years, too, the rates of growth for the
small denominations were higher than aver-
age. All things considered, therefore, how
the volume of coins in circulation is distrib-
uted in terms of the intended uses may be ex-
pected to resemble the distribution in the
D-Mark era over time.
