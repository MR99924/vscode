IndustryThe situation in industry showed a marked
improvement early in the year and remainedpositive in February. Neither new orders noroutput quite matched their levels in January,which had been affected by catching up onthe backlog caused by public holidays and“bridge” days in the final quarter of last year.The shortfall remained within narrow bounds,however. New orders in January and Febru-ary, taken together, were thus nearly 1
12%
up on their autumn 2002 level in seasonallyadjusted terms. The year-on-year increasewas 2
34%.
At a seasonally adjusted 214%, foreign orders
in January and February achieved a particular-ly sharp rise on the final quarter of 2002,with the increase being especially marked inJanuary. Although the figure for February wasdown on the month, it was still markedly upon the level of the comparable period in early2002. In the first two months of the year, theyear-on-year figure was +4
34%, compared
with +512% in the final quarter of 2002.
Seasonally adjusted domestic demand picked
up noticeably in February. January and Febru-ary together were
34% up on the final quarter
of 2002. This two-month period produced a1% increase on the year, compared with+
14% in the autumn of last year.

6days. In seasonally adjusted terms, it largely
held up at that higher level in February. Onaverage, the first two months of the yearwere 2
14% up on the fourth quarter of 2002.
Compared with the same period last year,output likewise went up by 2
14%, after in-
creasing by no more than34% in the period
from October to December 2002.
ConstructionThere was a further setback in the construc-
tion sector in early 2003. The intake of orderswas particularly affected by the fact that, inview of the announced cutbacks in public as-sistance, many housing construction clientshad brought their orders forward to the lastfew months of 2002. This was followed by amarked decline at the start of 2003. Alongwith weak demand in industrial construction,this meant that total construction orders re-ceived in January were around 6% down onthe fourth quarter of 2002 in seasonally ad-justed terms. The year-on-year fall, which hadbeen 5
12% in autumn, increased to 914%i n
January.
If anything, seasonally adjusted construction
output in February declined even more sharp-ly than it had done in January. On an averageof the first two months of this year, it wasaround 6
12% down on the final quarter of
2002. Over 12 months, there was a fall inconstruction output of no less than 17
14%.
One major factor in this was the persistentcold winter weather.Economic conditions in Germany*

7Labour market
The labour market continued to be marked
by a fall in employment and a rise in un-employment. According to the figures of theFederal Statistical Office, the number of per-sons in work in January (more recent data areunavailable at present) fell to a seasonally ad-justed 38.42 million. This was 455,000 fewerpersons, or 1.2% less, than 12 months previ-ously. In the fourth quarter, the decline hadbeen noticeably smaller, at 0.9%. The un-favourable weather conditions, which ham-pered employment in the outdoor occupa-tions, also played a part in this worsening ofthe situation.
The number of persons officially registered as
unemployed did fall somewhat in March inline with the seasonal pattern. The declinewas noticeably smaller than usual, however,resulting in a further seasonally adjusted risein unemployment to 4.41 million. At around50,000 persons, however, the rise was some-what smaller than it had been in the previousmonths, when the effect of winter had beengreater. In March, the level was 450,000higher than 12 months earlier, comparedwith a year-on-year increase of no more than260,000 at the turn of 2002-03. The season-ally adjusted unemployment rate, as calcu-lated by the Federal Labour Office, went upto 10.6%. Using the standardised Europeandefinition, the relevant figure was 8.9%.
PricesConsumer prices continued to rise in March,
albeit at a somewhat slower pace than be-fore. The seasonally adjusted increase went
down to 0.2%. The year-on-rate of increasefell to 1.2% from 1.3% in February. Whilethe prices of industrial goods and of servicesremained unchanged in seasonally adjustedterms, there were significant rises in theprices of food and energy. Among foodstuffs,seasonal products were especially affectedand, among energy sources, heating oil. Inboth cases, the rather cold weather is likely tohave contributed to the surge in prices.
International oil prices came down signifi-
cantly after the start of the war in Iraq. In firstfew days of March, up to US$33
12had been
quoted for a barrel of North Sea Brent Oil,but prices had fallen back to below US$25 byearly April.
This has not yet left its mark on the import
price data available up to February. Instead,further energy price increases were recorded.The fact that seasonally adjusted importprices were nevertheless scarcely higher over-all than they had been in January was due tofurther price reductions in the case of othermajor goods. In this connection, the appreci-ation of the euro is likely to have been onefactor having a price-dampening impact. Im-port prices in February were 0.6% up on theyear. Excluding energy, the decline over12 months was 2.5%.
The domestic factory gate prices of industrial
products showed a further significant season-ally adjusted rise in February. The year-on-year rate of increase went up to 1.9% from1.6% in January. Higher energy prices appearto have played an important role in this con-Employment

Public finance
Indebtedness of central, state and local
government
In February the indebtedness of central, state
and local government increased fairly sharplyby37.4 billion. The Federal Government (ie
central government) was responsible for justover one-third of this amount ( 32.6 billion).
Including the resources required to reduce itsoutstanding money market loans by 31.2 bil-
lion and to further redeem liabilities in theamount of 312.0 billion, it tapped the capital
market for 315.7 billion gross. Sales of five-
year Federal notes (Bobls) alone yielded 37.8
billion. After redeeming the series whichmatured in February, the Federal Governmentrecorded a net inflow from Bobls of 31.3 bil-
lion. In addition, it raised 32.1 billion and
30.8 billion, respectively, by running down its
market management stocks of Federal bonds(Bunds) and two-year Federal Treasury notes(Schätze). Central government repaid bankloans to the net value of 30.3 billion.
The Land governments (state government)
borrowed 34.6 billion on balance in February.
They raised 36.1 billion gross and 35.6 billion
net through the issue of Treasury notes andbonds, thus issuing an amount which wasroughly as high as that of the previousmonth. The states of Berlin, Brandenburg andNorth-Rhine Westphalia in particular each
participated with sales volumes of more than31 billion net. Whereas the Land govern-
ments repaid short-term cash advances frombanks amounting to 32.4 billion in all, they
simultaneously incurred additional liabilitiestotalling 31.4 billion in the form of loans
against borrowers’ notes. The “GermanUnity” Fund repaid loans worth 30.1 billion
net. Local government probably increased itsindebtedness again somewhat in February.
Federal Government borrowingIn March the Federal Government reduced its
indebtedness marginally by 30.7 billion. It cut
its liabilities on the money market consider-ably more sharply than in February (- 36.2 bil-
lion). This was offset by net borrowing on theNet borrowing in the market

9capital market of 35.5 billion, which was
dominated by the sale of Bunds ( 36.5 billion
net) and the issue of Bobls ( 33.9 billion net).
However, the Federal Government’s liabilitiesarising from Schätze contracted by 34.5 bil-
lion. Out of a new issue of these securitieswith a volume of 36.4 billion, 34.4 billion
was transferred to the “German Unity” Fund.Of the maturing issue from March 2001, 36.5
billion accrued to the Federal Governmentand 33.5 billion to the special funds (which
thus received 30.9 billion net from the sale of
Schätze). Small net redemptions were record-ed for both Federal savings notes and bankloans.
In the first quarter of 2003 net Federal Gov-
ernment borrowing amounted to 319.9 bil-
lion; this was only marginally lower than thecomparable figure in 2002 ( 320.5 billion). Al-
though the Federal Government raised 34.2
billion on the money market, the level of out-standing liabilities at the end of the quarterwas little more than half as high as at thesame time last year ( 310.2 billion). The in-
crease in capital market debt in the first threemonths of this year amounted to 356.6 bil-
lion gross and 315.7 billion net. Borrowing
occurred mainly in the medium and long-term maturity segments: both Bunds (+ 312.6
billion) and Bobls (+ 35.5 billion) recorded a
small increase in the relative share of FederalGovernment debt vis-à-vis the level at theend of 2002. Furthermore, the decliningtrend seen for quite some time now in liabil-ities in the form of Federal savings notes(-32.5 billion) and loans against borrowers’
notes (- 31.4 billion) persisted in the first quar-
ter of this year. The incurrence of new debt asrecorded in the above market flows is not a
reliable yardstick of the likely evolution of thenet borrowing requirement for the whole of2003 (as recorded in the government budgetaccounts).
With regard to the financing terms for new
issues, the Federal Government met with veryfavourable conditions in the first quarter forall maturity segments, as illustrated by therolling over of maturing securities issues. Forsecurities of less than one year, the issue yieldof Treasury discount paper (Bubills) in the firstquarter of 2003 was on average 78 basispoints below that of the securities which ma-tured in these three months. In the two-yearsegment, Schätze were issued at 1
34percent-
age points lower than the redeemed secur-ities. In the case of Bobls, the Federal Govern-Net borrowing in the market by the

10ment profited from a decline in capital mar-
ket interest rates primarily in the form of avery high premium. The low interest rate levelwas most noticeable in the case of ten-yearbonds; this is evident from the difference be-tween the Bund issued in January 2003 witha 4.5% coupon and a maturing bond of theTreuhand Agency with an interest rate of7.125% which was repaid in the samemonth.
Securities markets
Bond marketIn February, domestic borrowers issued bonds
in the German market to a market value of399.1 billion, compared with 3118.6 billion in
the previous month. Owing to a decline in re-demptions and in changes in issuers’ holdingsof their own bonds, net sales, at 324.8 billion,
were nonetheless up somewhat on January(322.6 billion). Sales of foreign bonds in the
German market raised 31.6 billion net; on
balance, all of these bonds were denomin-ated in euro. Overall, net sales of domesticand foreign bonds thus yielded 326.4 billion
in February, compared with 324.2 billion one
month previously.
Just under half of the funds raised accrued to
credit institutions, which raised 311.2 billion
net from sales of their own bonds, comparedwith only 31.0 billion in January. Debt secur-
ities issued by specialised credit institutionsand other bank bonds continued to take thelead; on balance, these sales raised 39.9 bil-
lion and 37.6 billion respectively. The volumeof mortgage Pfandbriefe outstanding in-
creased by 31.5 billion, while public Pfand-
briefe were redeemed for 37.9 billion (net).
In February the public sector increased its
bonded debt by 38.3 billion. The Land gov-
ernments raised 34.9 billion net from the sale
of bonds. The Federal Government raisedonly 32.9 in the bond market – mainly as part
of market management operations – as op-posed to 317.5 billion in the previous month.
It thus continued to pursue its policy of con-centrating long-term issues in January andJuly.
In February, 35.4 billion net worth of corpor-
ate bonds were sold, following record sales of37.3 billion in January.
In February, the main bond purchasers were
non-resident investors, which increased theirinvestment in the German bond market by317.6 billion. Domestic non-banks added
39.0 billion to their bond portfolios. They in-
vested mainly in domestic debt securities(37.5 billion), the bulk of their purchases
being bonds issued by private borrowers. Onbalance, credit institutions sold 30.2 billion
worth of fixed interest securities, most ofwhich were bank bonds (- 32.4 billion).
Equity marketIssuing activity in the German equity market
remained weak in February. Domestic enter-prises placed new shares to a market value ofonly 30.9 billion (January: 30.7 billion).

11foreign equities outstanding decreased by
34.9 billion. On balance, shares issued by
German enterprises were purchased exclu-sively by non-banks ( 34.8 billion), which re-
duced their holdings of foreign equities by33.7 billion. By contrast, domestic credit insti-
tutions reduced their holdings of domesticshares by 32.1 billion net and non-resident in-
vestors by 31.9 billion net.
Mutual fund sharesThe resources raised by domestic mutual
funds amounted to 39.7 billion in February,
compared with 312.9 billion in January. The
monies were invested primarily in specialisedfunds ( 36.2 billion). Funds open to the gen-
eral public sold 33.5 billion worth of shares.
As in the previous month, most of these re-sources ( 32.0 billion) accrued to open-end
real estate funds. Bond-based funds sold 31.2
billion worth of shares and money marketfunds sold 30.9 billion worth. Share-based
funds and mixed funds, however, redeemedshares ( 30.4 billion and 30.1 billion respect-
ively). In February, 30.7 billion net of foreign
fund shares were returned.
By far the majority of mutual fund shares
were bought by domestic non-banks ( 38.4
billion), which, on balance, purchased domes-tic fund shares only. Credit institutions’ hold-ings of mutual fund shares went up by 30.6
billion.Balance of payments
In February 2003 Germany’s current account
ran a surplus of 34.7 billion compared with a
small deficit of 31.3 billion in January. This im-
provement was mainly due to a significantlylower negative balance on invisible currenttransactions, which is that part of the currentaccount comprising services, factor incomeand current transfers. In addition, a largertrade surplus was generated.
According to figures from the Federal Statis-
tical Office, the surplus on foreign trade in-creased in February to 310.6 billion. This was
more than 31
12billion better than the corres-
ponding outcome in January. After the elim-ination of seasonal influences, however, thetrade surplus fell slightly by just over 3

January and February together, exports were1% down on the preceding three-monthperiod. By contrast, imports of goods main-tained their level in a three-month compari-son.
Other current transactions with non-residents
recorded a negative balance in February of35.8 billion. In January this deficit had
amounted to 39.6 billion. In particular, lower
net outflows in the form of factor incomecontributed to this improvement. In Februarythis sub-item registered a shortfall of 31.1 bil-
lion as against a deficit of 34.9 billion in Janu-
ary, which had been fuelled by high interestpayments to non-residents on fixed-incomesecurities. In addition, the negative servicesaccount shortened to 32.2 billion (January:
33.9 billion). By contrast, net current transfers
to the rest of the world increased in Februarycompared with the previous month by 31.7
billion to 32.5 billion.
Cross-border financial transactions in Febru-
ary led to high net inflows of capital in con-nection with portfolio investment, whereasnet outflows of funds were recorded in thecase of direct investment and unsecuritisedcredit transactions.

billion), whereas they sold equities on balance(31.9 billion). By contrast, domestic investors
withdrew 35.2 billion from securities markets
abroad during the month under review. Be-sides money market paper ( 33.5 billion) and
mutual fund shares ( 30.7 billion) they mainly
sold foreign equities on balance ( 36.0 billion).
They bought a limited amount of foreignbonds ( 35.0 billion), which were principally
denominated in euro ( 33.1 billion). Total net
inflows of capital in February resulting fromportfolio transactions came to 321.0 billion.
Much smaller net exports of capital ensued
from direct investment operations in February(33.1 billion) than in January ( 314.7 billion).
The main reason for this was the decline incross-border investment by domestic enter-prises, which channelled 32.8 billion into
their foreign subsidiaries and branches (asagainst 316.6 billion in January). By contrast,
foreign firms withdrew 30.2 billion of netcapital from their subsidiaries and branches in
Germany.
Non-banks’ unsecuritised credit transactions
in February closed with a marginal outflow ofcapital on balance. Enterprises and individualstransferred 32.6 billion net to other countries,
thus increasing their credit balances withforeign banks somewhat. By contrast, gen-eral government borrowed 31.6 billion net
abroad. The domestic banking system record-ed net capital exports amounting to 329.8
billion, a reflection, as it were, of all othercross-border transactions. Domestic credit in-stitutions transferred 330.8 billion of financial
resources abroad, the bulk of which relatedto short-term credit business ( 327.7 billion),
while 31.0 billion net accrued to the Bundes-
bank, largely in the context of paymentsettlements.

transaction values – by 30.3 billion in Febru-

15The development of
public finances inGermany followingqualification forEuropean monetaryunionThe current situation of public finances
in Germany is extremely tense. Thedeficit ceiling of 3% of GDP as set bythe Maastricht Treaty was clearly over-shot in 2002. The extremely sharp risein the deficit over the past two yearsbrought about by the macroeconomicslowdown and the tax relief measureswhich entered into effect in 2001 werethe main reasons. Although the def-icits had declined continuously in thethree preceding years, this seeminglywelcome development was based onfavourable cyclical influences and theextraordinarily positive tax revenueduring that period. Without these ef-fects, the deficits would have risen.Since 1997 the increase in expenditurehas been more moderate than in theyears between reunification and 1997,averaging around 2% a year. Given thesluggish macroeconomic growth trend,however, the contribution to consoli-dation of the expenditure side admit-tedly remained very limited. Fiscal pol-icy is now faced with the task of lower-ing the large structural deficit. Owingalso to the already adopted compre-hensive income tax cuts, this will re-quire central, state and local govern-ment to curb expenditure in the com-ing years more strongly than in thepreceding years.

16Preliminary remarks
This article explains the development of public
finances since 1997, the decisive year in whichGermany qualified for being a founder mem-ber of European monetary union. In addition,1997 saw the adoption of the Stability andGrowth Pact, which specified and expandedthe fiscal policy regulations for the EuropeanUnion which were contained in the MaastrichtTreaty. Despite a continuation of unfavourableeconomic developments, the government def-icit, after having still been above the ceiling of3% of GDP in 1995 and 1996, fell to 2.7% in1997, thus meeting the Maastricht deficit cri-terion. The debt ratio did rise to 61% againstthe background of low nominal economicgrowth, thereby overshooting the referencevalue of 60%. However, given the specialreunification-related burdens, the fact that thelimit was overshot by only a small margin andthe prospect of the debt ratio receding in thefollowing years, the Ecofin Council decided tostop the excessive deficit procedure it had in-stituted following Germany’s overshooting ofthe 3% deficit ceiling. This meant that the fis-cal policy convergence criteria were met.
When analysing public finances, this report will
use the definition of general government ac-cording to the European System of Accounts(ESA). This system provides the basis for thedeficit criterion of the Maastricht Treaty andthe monitoring of the budgetary situation pur-suant to the Stability and Growth Pact. In mostcases, the budgetary outturns of the individuallevels of government, which are reflected inthe financial statistics, form the basis for thenational accounts in Germany. However, thereare some differences between the two ac-
counting systems (see overview on p 17).
Two phases of government financial
development
1998 to 2000: seeming improvement in
public finances in a relatively favourableeconomy
Having fallen slightly below the 3% ceiling in
1997, the government deficit ratio continuedto fall gradually, reaching 1.4% in 2000.
1This
was caused mainly by the generally favour-able economic climate. Whereas in 1997public finances had been affected by an eco-nomic downturn, during the next three yearsthe average annual growth rate of real GDP(+2.3%) was well above the medium-termtrend. The improvement in the overall eco-nomic situation led to a cyclically-inducedreduction in the deficit which is likely to haveamounted to around 1% of GDP by 2000 (formore details on the method of cyclically ad-justing government deficits and the proced-ures on which this analysis is based see thecomments in the annex, pp 29-32).
Another factor which played a significant role
in the reduction of the deficit was that the“profit-related taxes”
2developed much more
1For this analysis the one-off proceeds from the auction-
ing of UMTS licences ( 350.8 billion or 212% of GDP) have
been factored out of the national accounts outturns be-
cause of their temporary character and their volume.
2These include – to simplify matters extremely – corpor-
ation tax, non-assessed tax on earnings, trade tax (local
business tax (which is classified as an indirect tax in the
national accounts), interest withholding tax and assessed
income tax. These taxes are levied above all on business

17Public finances as defined in the national accounts
The Maastricht Treaty of 1992 which created Europeanmonetary union also set criteria regarding the public fi-
nances of the member states, which had to be met as partof the terms for accession. The budgetary outturns (as de-
fined in the government’s financial statistics), which show
revenue and expenditure in accordance with the nationalbudget system of the individual countries, were however
only comparable to a very limited extent owing to differ-
ences in methodology and definition. For that reason, re-
course was taken to a system of national accounts which is
largely uniform throughout Europe and which likewisecontains a statistical documentation of government fi-
nances. This concept has since been refined and – for over
three years as the third edition of the European System of
Accounts (ESA 95) – forms the basis for monitoring the de-
velopment of public finances and compliance with fiscalpolicy rules in the European Union. Eurostat, the European
Commission’s statistical office, oversees the calculation of
the national accounts outturns in the individual memberstates in terms of the excessive deficit procedure, and in
cases of doubt, after consulting national and, if necessary,
international expert bodies, takes accounting decisions
with European implications.
The two statistical concepts pursue different goals. The fi-
nancial statistics are closely tied to the budgetary process.
Their primary intention is to systematically record pay-
ments in public budgets. This is intended not only to pro-
vide an overview of the financial situation but also tomake it possible to examine the extent to which budget
plans have been implemented. By contrast, the national ac-
counts provide a picture of the macroeconomic process bywhich income is generated, used and distributed. Within
this framework, the government sector is a sub-segment
which is systematically linked to the other sectors. Al-
though the budget outturns usually form the basis of the
national accounts for the public sector, the different defin-itions may result in large differences in the amounts re-
corded in the statistics.
In the financial statistics, the date of an entry is decided by
its allocation to a budget year, which is generally based onwhen it matures. In the national accounts, by contrast, the
moment when a claim arises is the decisive moment. Tax
revenue, social security contributions, and interest expend-iture are thus, in contrast to financial statistical recording,
always transferred back to the point in time when a pay-
ment obligation arises. On the expenditure side, in the
case of construction investment, the national accounts
focus on the progress of construction. For general govern-ment budgets, these phase shifts alone could result in an
overall deviation between the two concepts of several bil-
lion euro.
The financial statistics’ focus on payment flows means that
shifts in financial assets such as the sales of participating
interests and loan repayments have an impact on the gov-
ernment deficit. However, in the national accounts suchpurely financial transactions, which do not directly pertain
to incomes, do not affect the budget balance. These differ-
ences in the method of entry are sometimes quite import-
ant when reporting government budget deficits. In thepast few years, government revenue from the sale of finan-
cial assets (especially through privatisation) for the most
part clearly surpassed comparable expenditure (especiallylending). For the Federal Government, this effect amount-
ed to a total of over 530 billion in the period from 1997 to
2002. In addition, that part of the Bundesbank’s profit –such as profits from sales of foreign currency – which is not
generated by normal central bank activities resulting main-
ly from the creation of money, is entered as a financial
transaction without any impact on the deficit in the na-
tional accounts. However, it is not always possible to drawsuch a clear line between shifts in financial assets and a
transaction with an impact on the deficit. For instance, in
the case of injections of capital to public sector enterprises,
it may sometimes be assumed that this is not an acquisition
of a participating interest with lasting value but insteadthe offsetting of a loss, which then has to be posted in the
national accounts in a manner which increases the deficit.
One example of this is the injection of capital to Bankge-sellschaft Berlin in 2001, which was recorded in the nation-
al accounts as a transfer of assets.
Along with the differences in respect of the level of the
deficit, the two concepts may also indicate deviatingtrends in expenditure and revenue. The reason lies in the
principle of gross accounting which is adhered to more
closely in the national accounts. Child benefit, for example,
is offset in the financial statistics against wage tax receipts,
whereas in the national accounts it is recorded on the ex-penditure side as a monetary social benefit. An increase in
child benefit is thus reflected in the national accounts as
an increase in expenditure and in the financial statistics asa decrease in revenue without deficits being recorded dif-
ferently. The treatment of tax breaks diverges in similar
fashion, such as the grant to home buyers and investment
grants. As child benefit has been increased and additional
generations of recipients of grants have become eligiblefor grants to home buyers, which have been in existence
since 1996, the growth in spending between 1997 and
2002 as defined in the national accounts was
12percentage
point higher than defined in the financial statistics. Ac-
cordingly, the tax ratio as defined in the financial statisticsdecreased by nearly 1 percentage point during that period,
whereas the comparable national accounts ratio went
down only slightly.
The method of presenting the government’s finances in
the national accounts introduced in this article is different
from that used in the ESA because domestic transactions
with the EU budget are all listed under the state sector,whereas the ESA assumes, among other things, that the
turnover taxes forwarded by the member states go directly
to the rest of the world (which includes the EU budget).
The method used here keeps the waning medium-term sig-
nificance of VAT resources and the conversely increasingshare (listed in the state sector under ESA) of GNP re-
sources from leading to a distortionary trend in the tax
ratio as well as the expenditure ratio over time. Withoutsuch a statistical adjustment, these ratios would increase
even though, in actual fact, the burden on taxpayers and
Germany’s overall contributions to financing the EU
budget would not change at all.

18favourably than was to be expected owing to
the impact of changes in tax legislation andthe development of property and entrepre-neurial income calculated in the national ac-counts (which, in the Bundesbank’s cyclicaladjustment procedure as well as in official taxestimates, are regarded as a point of refer-ence for the assessment basis of these taxes).This unexpectedly sharp increase in revenuewas reflected by the fact that tax revenue dis-tinctly outpaced official tax estimates duringthat period.
3The sharp increase in tax rev-
enue, however, was largely temporary innature, as developments over the followingyears indicated, and was therefore not indica-tive of a fundamental improvement in gov-ernment finance (see overview on p 19 formore information).
On balance, the growth of government rev-
enue was dampened by a slight reduction inlevies. There was a structural shift from socialsecurity contributions towards excise taxes.Other revenue declined, with a sharp reduc-tion in the Bundesbank’s profit in 2000 hav-ing a particularly pronounced effect.
The expenditure side made no contribution to
consolidation. Although expenditure rose byan annual average of only 2% – with theoverall expenditure ratio having been reducedby one percentage point – when adjusted forthe favourable cyclical development, whichhad also been reflected in a distinct decline inunemployment figures, this rise in expend-iture was around 2
12%. Budget management
which tended to be more stringent, andwhich was associated with a distinct reduc-tion in the number of staff, was offset by con-siderable increases in expenditure on child
benefit, grants to homebuyers and old-ageprovision for Post Office pensioners. In add-ition, the year 2000 saw one-off expenditureon indemnification payments for wartimeforced labourers.
On the whole, the structural situation of pub-
lic finance did not improve between 1997and 2000 but in fact even deteriorated – des-pite the sharp decline in the overall deficit. Agolden opportunity (from today’s perspective)to undertake comprehensive structural con-solidation was missed – not least because ex-pectations regarding overall economic devel-opments in the subsequent years were overlyoptimistic, leading to a misjudgement of thestructural budgetary situation.
2001 and 2002: Sharp rise in the deficit
during the downturn
In 2001 and 2002 the government deficit in
Germany expanded sharply. Last year the def-icit ratio reached 3.6%, thus exceeding theMaastricht Treaty’s 3% limit by a considerablemargin and prompting the Ecofin Council todeclare an excessive deficit for Germany inJanuary 2003.
The rise in the deficit which equalled more
than 2% of GDP in total, is partly the result ofthe sharp economic downswing. The cyclicaladjustment procedure used here shows thatin 2002 public finances deteriorated by

19around12% of GDP compared with the fig-
ures for 2000 due to cyclical impacts.
Moreover, there were additional factors
which reduced tax revenue. The sizeable taxcuts which entered into force at the begin-ning of 2001 had a major impact. The rev-enue shortfalls caused by this reform are likelyto have amounted to just over 1% of GDP .Although these contrasted with increases inlevies in 2002 – especially excise taxes andcontributions to the health insurance funds –they were much lower than the previousyear’s tax cuts. In addition, the overflowing“profit-related” tax revenue of the previousyears experienced a pronounced turnaround.Therefore, such tax revenue has recently beenexceptionally low. For instance, the revalu-ation of balance sheet assets led to extensivewrite-downs due not least to the sharp slidein prices on equity markets. In the aggregate,the development of revenue was the decisivefactor in the sharp rise in the deficit. The taxmeasures and the aforementioned negativeinfluences conspired to reduce the levy ratioby 2
12percentage points in two years.
As in the preceding phase, expenditure rose
by an average of around 2% a year. Thisreflected a more favourable trend to theextent that it was not associated with animprovement in the economy. Adjusted forthis cyclical factor, expenditure grew by only1
34%, thus contributing to consolidation. The
main reasons were tight budget managementalong with declining investment expenditure,relief caused by the low level of interest rates,and reduced transfers to the EU budget. Thismore than offset expansions of payments in
Deutsche BundesbankThe development of the deﬁ  cit 
ratio between 1997 and 2002 — an assessment of the contribution of cyclical and other temporary factors
The chart below shows the year-on-year change 
in the budget balance. It also contains an assess-ment of cyclical and other transitory effects which have affected the development of the balance. The ”cyclical inﬂ  uence” was calculated using the 
Bundesbank’s cyclical adjustment procedure (see Appendix, p 29). ”Other transitory inﬂ  uences” 
are understood to mean, on the one hand, major one-off effects. They include extraordinary surpluses (1999) or deﬁ  cits (2002) in the pension 
insurance funds caused by errors in assessing the contribution rate, one-off burdens connected with the indemniﬁ  cation payments to wartime 
forced labourers (2000), injection of capital into Bankgesellschaft Berlin (2001) and the extremely low Bundesbank proﬁ  t in 2000 as shown in the 
national accounts. On the other hand, changes in ”proﬁ  t-related” taxes which were caused neither 
by changes in tax legislation (according to infor-mation from the Federal Ministry of Finance) nor by cyclical ﬂ  uctuation (as is estimated on the 
basis of the cyclical adjustment procedure) are roughly assessed. For this purpose, the tax rev-enue was ﬁ  rst adjusted for these factors. The dif-
ference between the growth rate of the adjusted variable and the growth rate of the nominal GDP trend (which is largely identical to the growth of the trend of corporate and property income) was approximated as a transitory inﬂ  uence (for the 
development of ”proﬁ  t-related” taxes see the 
chart on p 20).

20other areas (eg child benefit, unemployment
benefits and sickness benefit).
All in all, the growing deficits in 2001 and
2002 were largely attributable to cyclical andother transitory influences (see overview onp 19). In addition, the extensive tax cuts thatcame into force in 2001 also caused a struc-tural deterioration in the financial situationsince these tax cuts were not adequatelyfunded by budget relief measures in otherareas. In recent years, with the structural def-icit not having been reduced, and a sufficientdistance to the upper deficit limit not havingbeen maintained, the macroeconomic down-turn, combined with considerable tax cuts,caused the government deficit to clearly over-shoot the 3% deficit limit. During this entireperiod, the government did not by anymeans implement austerity measures. In-
stead, not only did the automatic stabiliserswork, but taxes were also reduced by a con-siderable amount in net terms.
Government revenue trends
During the period under review, budgetary de-
velopments were decisively influenced by therevenue side. Between 1997 and 2000, rev-enue from direct taxes rose sharply, eventhough, on balance, revenue-reducing changesto tax legislation prevailed (such as the cut inthe solidarity surcharge). In terms of GDP , rev-enue from direct taxes went up by nearly 1
12
percentage points. The decisive factor was that“profit-related” direct taxes grew exorbitantly,by around 80% (or 1
12%o fG D P )i nj u s tt h r e e
years. During that period, large additional pay-ments for previous years coincided with a sharpincrease in prepayments. This also reflected de-velopments on financial markets. The picturereversed itself in 2001 and 2002. The extensivetax cuts were associated with a slumping econ-omy and falling share prices. The direct taxratio went down by nearly 2 percentagepoints, with large write-downs in the corporatesector also playing a role.

4For example, the fact that this was the last chance for
enterprises to claim tax write-downs on their participat-
ing interests before the tax exemption of capital gains
from the sale of equity stakes came into force, thus elim-
inating the write-down options, may also have played a
role. By contrast, the distribution of profits retained in
earlier years probably had only a limited impact, if at all,
on tax revenue. See also Deutsche Bundesbank (2002),

22Indirect taxes were raised noticeably; these
served particularly to lower the immediatelevy burden on labour as a factor of produc-tion by increasing the tax-based share offunding for the social security funds. Thus, in1998 turnover tax was increased, and in1999, as part of the “ecological tax reform”,energy taxes were gradually increased andtheir scope expanded. All in all, this is likely tohave generated added revenue worth 1% ofGDP in 2002 (compared with 1997). How-ever, the ratio of indirect taxes to GDP in2002 was only equal to the 1997 figure afterhaving risen by
12percentage point in 1999.
There were several factors behind this devel-
opment. Revenue from trade tax (local busi-ness tax) – which is classified as an indirecttax in the national accounts – rose sharplyuntil 1999, even though the trade capital taxwas abolished in the 1998 assessment year. Itwent back down sharply in 2001 and 2002,however. Revenue from the tax on the pur-chase of land and buildings likewise peakedin 1999. In addition, revenue from turnovertax (adjusted for the increase in the taxationrate in April 1998 which led to a temporaryrise in the turnover tax ratio) as a percentageof GDP declined. A large part of this was ac-counted for by the fact that the componentssubject to turnover tax rose more slowly thanoverall GDP , which recently had mainly beensupported by (non-tax-generating) exports.Moreover, revenue from turnover tax grewmore weakly in the past two years than theirmacroeconomic assessment basis, a factwhich can be approximately derived from thenational accounts. In the light of measures tocombat turnover tax fraud, the reverse devel-opment, in fact, would have been expected
in the past year. Finally, taxable energy con-sumption grew much more weakly than over-all GDP , not least because of the increase inthe price of crude oil and the introduction ofthe “ecological tax reform”.
Between 1997 and 2002 revenue from social
security contributions rose by an average ofonly 1% per year. Their share in GDP conse-quently fell from 19.7% to 18.4%. This isdue in large part to the decline in the contri-bution rate to the pension insurance schemeof more than one percentage point whichwas made possible by the increasing use oftaxes to fund pension insurance, as men-tioned earlier in this article.
5It must also be
borne in mind that the contribution rates forthe social security funds had not been set suf-ficiently high in 2002. The deficit thusamounted to 37 billion, whereas a surplus of
31 billion was recorded in 1997. This explains
nearly one-third of the decline in the socialsecurity contribution ratio. In addition, the de-velopment of social security contributions wasdampened by lower contribution payments onwage substitution benefits, which were adopt-ed, above all, to relieve the strain on the Fed-eral budget and the Federal Labour Office.
Other government revenue rose only margin-
ally during the period under review (by an an-nual average of
12%), causing its share in
GDP to decrease by nearly12percentage
point to 3.7%. This reflects inter alia the fall
in revenue from government sales (which are

most likely to have its foundation in the factthat fee budgets have been factored out ofgovernment budgets as independent units.

Government expenditure trends
Between 1998 and 2002 expenditure rose
relatively steadily by an average of around2% per year. If cyclical factors are excluded,the adjusted expenditure ratio probably de-creased slightly in the period under review,with the outsourcing of items from core gov-ernment budgets having played a role. Thismakes it clear that, given a sluggish nominaleconomic growth trend, there is hardly anyleeway left to increase government expend-iture if public finances are to be consolidatedwithout increasing the tax burden.
The rise in expenditure was attributable in
particular to social benefits,
7which in 2002
made up 57% of government expenditureand were mainly accounted for by the socialsecurity funds. Hence around 80% of the an-nual average increase in overall expenditurebetween 1997 and 2002 can be explained bydevelopments in this category (see the adja-cent chart). This reflects the multiple increasesin child benefit. Admittedly, growth in thearea of old-age provision, by far the most im-portant social benefit category, had a muchgreater impact. In the light of the continuousrise in the number of pensions paid and theregular pension adjustments (each +1
12%o n
average per year) as well as the stronggrowth in expenditure on pensions, includingpayments to Post Office pension funds whichwere introduced in 1999, this category rose
by 3
12% per year.
Expenditure on health care rose by an aver-
age of 212% per year, with major differences
between the various subsectors and, latterly,a strong increase in expenditure on pharma-ceuticals, in particular. The fact that the ratioof expenditure on health care to GDP has re-mained largely constant during the entireperiod under review (although the trend hasrecently been back on the rise) is attributable%

measures. It must not detract from the needfor a thorough reform of the overall structureof the health care system in order to increaseefficiency.
Whereas expenditure on unemployed persons
fell by around 5% until 2000 as a result ofthe declining unemployment, it then roseagain sharply and, by 2002, had exceeded its1997 level – even though the number of un-employed persons was half a million fewerthan in the starting year and the social secur-ity contribution payments for beneficiarieshad been curtailed distinctly. The main reasonfor this development was that the number ofrecipients of unemployment benefits and thenumber of participants in labour market policymeasures had, in fact, gone up slightly. Un-employment benefit payments, too, were
raised considerably following a ruling by theFederal Constitutional Court in 2000.
Personnel expenditure – the most important
expenditure category of central, state andlocal government – grew only moderately dur-ing the period under review (by an average ofaround +
12% a year) and thus made a tangible
contribution to consolidation. The decline inthe number of staff working in the civil serviceby an annual average of around 1
12%m a d ea
decisive contribution. Admittedly, it must benoted that the decline in staff numbers is duein part to outsourcing (especially of feebudgets) and that, in the eastern Federalstates, the number of persons employed inthis sector, which is still above average, hasbeen adjusted. Negotiated wages and salariesin the public sector grew by an average ofaround 2% per year between 1997 and 2002.This growth was thus somewhat lower than inthe private sector.
Interest expenditure actually went down slight-
ly during the period under review. This wasmainly attributable to low capital market rateswhich enabled (higher-yielding) debt instru-ments reaching maturity to be refinanced at fa-vourable rates. By contrast, the debt rose by atotal of 12% or over 3140 billion even though
proceeds from the auction of UMTS licences(351 billion) were used to pay off debts. At
60.8% in the past year, the debt ratio onceagain surpassed the 60% mark, after havingfallen below the limit in 2001 for the first timesince 1996 (for the pattern of the debt ratiosee the adjacent chart). The ratio betweeninterest expenditure and debt, which can be%

ernment debt, went down from 6.1% in 1997to 5.3% last year.
Government fixed capital formation declined
by an average of 1% each year between 1997and 2002; it rose between 1997 and 1999 andthen declined markedly in the three yearsthereafter. In 2002 investment made up justunder 3
12% of government expenditure (com-
pared with nearly 4% in 1997). This develop-ment is partly the consequence of the extremedeterioration of the municipal budget balancesover the past few years since the municipalitiesaccount for the largest portion of expenditureon tangible fixed assets and react to pressureon budgets primarily by reducing investment.The outsourcing of fee budgets and the gov-ernment real estate administration (includinginvestment activity) from core budgets is alsolikely to play a role. As part of the process ofconsolidating government budgets, a declinein government investment is not to be regard-ed as negative if it reflects greater efficiency inadministrating government fixed assets ormore targeted government investment activity– possibly combined with increased privatesector provision of infrastructure. All the same,the maintenance and development of the gov-ernment infrastructure is a general governmenttask which is particularly significant for macro-economic growth; this means that the reduc-tion in the weight of this category of expend-iture tends to have worsened the structure ofgovernment finance.
By contrast, government capital transfers rose
steeply. These include, in particular, investmentgrants to the corporate sector and the grant tohome buyers, which is posted in the national
accounts as a capital transfer to households.The latter shows strong growth because it wasintroduced in 1996 and is given for eight yearsat a time, with the effect that an additionalgeneration will have grown into this promotionmeasure every year until 2003. Between 1997and 2002 the annual volume of the grant tohome buyers rose by 37

Trends at individual levels of government
The central, state and local government budget
trend was characterised by sharp fluctuations intax revenue. The local governments, which arethe beneficiaries of trade tax, which is particu-larly vulnerable to the business cycle, experi-enced the sharpest decline in the past twoyears, with the increase in the levy on trade taxpayable to central and state government play-ing a role. However, local government had, inearlier years, greatly benefited at times from in-creases in profit-related tax revenue. On thewhole, the Federal Government’s revenue grewthe strongest during the period under review.This, admittedly, was attributable above all tothe tax increases which the Federal Governmentthen used to play an increasing role in financingthe pension insurance scheme.

expenditure increased by an average of 1.3%a year, with central and local governmentraising expenditure by around 1% and stategovernment by 2%. The staff-heavy stategovernment budgets were subjected to parti-cular strains caused by rising expenditure onpensions. These payments have gone up byaround one-quarter and now already accountfor over 6% of all state government expend-iture.
The general government deficit in 2002 was
370 billion, nearly 320 billion more than in
1997. In many cases, the upper net borrow-ing limits under budgetary law were over-shot. The deficit is attributable – more or lessin equal parts – to central government, onthe one hand, and to state and local govern-ment, on the other.
The debt financing of social security funds is
not permitted as a general rule. All the same,many health insurance institutions, after hav-ing depleted their reserves, recently took uploans. On the whole, the social security fundsrecorded rising surpluses
9between 1997 and
1999, especially because the fluctuation re-serves of the statutory pension insurancescheme had to be replenished to a statutoryminimum level after this level had beenundershot in previous years due to vast def-icits.

27funds. Unexpectedly weak growth of income
subject to compulsory insurance contribu-tions, particularly during the past year, wasthe main factor behind this development,which took place despite an increase in thecontribution rates to the health insurancefunds and in Federal grants to the pension in-surance scheme. Negative wage drift had amajor impact (not least as a result of reducedspecial payments and fewer overtime hoursworked). The decline in employment alsoplayed a role. The growth in expenditure onsocial security funds (+2
34%) during the
period under review considerably outpacedthat of central, state and local government.
Outlook
The development of public finances this year
is subject to great uncertainty in the light ofmacroeconomic risks. From today’s vantagepoint, the continued unfavourable macro-economic trend will be reflected in risingcyclically-induced revenue shortfalls fromtaxes and social contributions as well as inadded labour-market-related expenditure.Assistance to flood disaster victims will put anadditional strain on central, state and localgovernment, albeit probably to a lesser extentthan originally expected. These, however,contrast with a considerable volume ofrevenue-enhancing measures with a totalscope of around
12% of GDP .10Moreover,
there are tax measures still in the legislativeprocess which are designed to increase rev-enue. As regards expenditure, very prudentbudget management is to be expected in thelight of the agreements reached by the Finan-cial Planning Council and of the extremely
tense budget situation which central, stateand local government are facing. In addition,cost-cutting measures affecting the health in-surance funds and the Federal Labour Officewill probably curb expenditure growth. Onthe whole, therefore, during the current yearthe structural deficit is expected to decrease,representing consolidation progress. It seemsprobable from today’s vantage point, how-ever, that the 3% overall deficit ceiling will beovershot. The outcome will ultimately hingeon subsequent macroeconomic develop-ments and on the extent of consolidationmeasures taken.
Seen over the medium term, a comprehensive
structural consolidation of public finances willbe necessary. Sound public finances are an im-portant foundation for sustainable macroeco-nomic growth amid stable prices. They fosterconfidence in the ability of general govern-ment to limit the burden of tax and socialsecurity contributions in the future and tohandle the demographic strains on publicfinances. A structurally balanced budget is,not least, a key requirement of the EuropeanStability and Growth Pact. It enables the press-ing burden of interest rates to be reduced andgives government budgets room to breatheover the cycle without running the risk of over-shooting the 3% ceiling.
10Besides increasing the tax on energy, temporarily rais-
ing the corporation tax rate and further raising the to-
bacco tax, the contribution rate to the pension insurance
scheme was increased, as was the maximum level of
earnings subject to pension and unemployment insur-
ance contributions. In addition, the average contribution
rate to the statutory health insurance funds was already
distinctly increased at the beginning of the year.2003 associ-

28Germany’s most recent stability programme
of December 2002 embarks on a path of con-solidation which, in line with European com-mitments, envisages a balanced budget in2006. However, this is based on optimisticgrowth assumptions. Now it is vitally import-ant to put the announced structural improve-ments on a sound basis by means of suitablefiscal policy measures. Short-term unforeseendeficits caused by a temporary economicslump can be handled if the path on whichthe stability programme is based is imple-mented. What this also means, though, isthat, in an upswing, deficits have to be re-duced much more quickly. Developments inthe period between 1998 and 2000 shouldserve as a warning: the opportunity to reducestructural deficits was missed because favour-able economic developments and special ef-fects created the illusion of consolidation.Fundamentally, it seems advisable based onthe experience of the past few years to derivebudget plans from conservative macroeco-nomic assumptions. This also means that theself-financing effects of tax policy measuresshould not be factored into the plans fromthe outset. To be better able to assess struc-tural budgetary developments, analyses ofpublic finances should be supplemented by acyclically adjusted analysis and by estimationsof other transitory influences.
The reduction in government deficits must
begin with central, state and local govern-ment budgets. Their deficit ratio in 2002 was3.3%, half of which was accounted for bythe Federal Government and the other halfby the Land governments and local author-
ities. That results in a need for structural con-solidation totalling just under 2
12% of GDP ,11
on top of which there will be, in 2004 and
2005, income tax cuts totalling just over 1%of GDP . However, if it is assumed that leviesare not to be raised elsewhere, central, stateand local government expenditure must bekept largely unchanged until this objectivehas been attained in order to meet Europeancommitments. All levels of government arecalled upon here to work towards makingtheir government activities more efficient andultimately “leaner”. Structurally balancedbudgets should be the key fiscal policy yard-stick for all levels of government to be judgedby.
In 2002 the social security funds posted relati-
vely small deficits compared to central, stateand local government. In the light of the gen-eral ban on debt financing, it may be neces-sary to raise contribution rates in order to bal-ance the budget. This does not absolve socialsecurity funds of the need for radical reforms,however. The high and rising social securitycontributions and the attendant rise in thecost of labour as a factor of production, areposing a considerable impediment to growth.Demographic trends will make the problemeven worse in the future. This means that thestatutory social security benefits need to bereviewed comprehensively – not only to pre-vent contribution rates from rising, but toactually reduce them visibly.

of12% of GDP and that cyclical and other temporary

ernment in 2002 totalling12% of GDP .Central, state

The role of cyclical adjustment in assessing
public finances
When analysing public finances, it is of particular
interest to know whether an observed change is at-tributable to sustained – structural – factors orwhether it is just a temporary development thatshows up in public budgets on a one-off or tempor-ary basis. Structural developments are characterisedin particular by fiscal policy. However, they can alsobe rooted in other factors such as demographics. Ofthe transitory influences, cyclical effects are usuallythe most important. They are considered to beinduced by the fluctuation of macroeconomic de-velopments around a “normal” situation; influenceson government budgets generated by these move-ments will “automatically” recede. Additionally,further transitory measures or influences (eg indem-nification payments to former forced labourersor one-off proceeds from the auction of UMTSlicences) could be reflected in government budgets.
“Cyclical adjustment” is an attempt to calculate
the cyclical influence on the government budget –and, here, particularly on the government budgetbalance. Cyclical adjustment procedures are usedby the European Commission when evaluating thestability and convergence programmes as well aspublic finances in the European Union’s memberstates, for instance. The Deutsche Bundesbank,the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) andinternational organisations such as the IMF andthe OECD likewise use cyclical adjustmentmethods in support of their fiscal policy analyses.
12
The common feature of the approaches used by theEuropean Commission, the Bundesbank and theESCB is that they perceive cyclical fluctuations asmedium-term, symmetrical deviations from a trend
which balance out across the business cycle. Thisensures that positive and negative influences offsetone another over time. This concept of automaticstabilisers is also an underlying element of the Euro-pean Stability and Growth Pact, by means of whichthe member states have undertaken to bring theirgovernment budgets close to balance or into sur-plus in the medium term, ie over the business cycle.
The business cycle generally affects government
budgets both in terms of revenue and expenditure.On the revenue side, the Bundesbank’s cyclicaladjustment procedure covers wage tax, “profit-related” taxes, turnover tax and excise tax, as wellas social security contributions to the FederalLabour Office and to the statutory health insurancefunds and nursing care insurance scheme. On theexpenditure side, it is essentially unemploymentbenefits which are considered cyclically depend-ent.

30The cyclical component of these budget items is
largely determined by the cyclical swings of therespective macroeconomic assessment bases andby their dependency on this reference value(revenue and expenditure elasticities). The under-lying approach used here takes recourse to thenominal macroeconomic bases. Wage tax is tied tototal gross wages and salaries per employedperson and private sector employment, “profit-related” taxes to property and entrepreneurial in-come, the turnover tax to private consumptionand private homebuilding investment, excise tax toprivate consumption, and social security contribu-tions to gross wages and salaries in the privatesector. The cyclically-induced expenditure on un-employment benefits is determined from the pat-tern of unemployment figures (adjusted forchanges caused by labour market policy meas-ures). The respective revenue and expenditure elas-ticities are largely derived from legal regulations.
A statistical detrending technique is applied to cal-
culate the cyclical component of the various macro-economic bases. A Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter isused to calculate the medium-term trend for allmacroeconomic bases and the deviation of the ob-served variable from its trend is interpreted as thecyclical component (temporary trend deviation).
14
For the results of the cyclical adjustment procedurewhich are on the current end, in particular, it is im-portant to know how macroeconomic develop-ments are assessed in the next few years (the “end-point problem”). A correction of results and of theinterpretation can occur if the forecast has to be re-vised, thus making ex post adjustments to thetrend estimate necessary. This is an expression ofthe fact that the assessment of the current situ-ation (relatively good, bad or normal) depends sig-nificantly on – uncertain – future developments.However, ex post revisions usually only affect thelevel of the cyclical balance. Pronounced ex post
adjustments of the estimation of the year-on-yearchange in the cyclical influence are rarely necessary.
As opposed to the “disaggregated method” used
in this Monthly Report article, in which the individ-ual macroeconomic bases are analysed separatelyand which relies on nominal reference variables,the “aggregated approaches” used by the Euro-pean Commission, the OECD and the IMF assumea proportional relationship between the cyclicalcomponent of the budget balance and real GDP .
15
This means specific developments in individualmacroeconomic bases or phase shifts betweenbudgetary components and GDP are not takeninto account. For instance, macroeconomic devel-opments in 2000 had a relatively minor positivecyclical impact on public sector budgets becausethe structure tended to generate little in the wayof taxes. In this year the disaggregated approachtherefore shows a weaker cyclical improvement inthe budget balance than aggregated procedures.For 2001 the Bundesbank’s procedure shows arelatively weak decline in the cyclical components,especially because the average unemploymentfigures hardly changed and private consumptionrose relatively strongly. For that reason, the cyclicalexpenditure on unemployment and the cyclicalshare of turnover tax and excise tax revenue haveremained largely constant. In addition, prices wentup relatively strongly this year, which means thatthe cyclical deterioration had a less pronounced
14Here the HP filter is based on a smoothing parameter
(lambda) of 30, which corresponds to an average busi-
ness cycle length of around eight years. Although the
choice of smoothing parameter affects the level of the
estimated cyclical components, the crucial statements re-
main unchanged even if other common values are used,
such as 20 or 100.

31impact on the general government budget than is
suggested by basing the observation on real GDP .
An additional difference between the two cyclical
adjustment methods is that the approaches usedby the European Commission, the OECD and theIMF to calculate the cyclical situation do not relyon a statistical detrending method but on a pro-duction potential approach.
16Finally, the method
on which this Monthly Report article is based usesa more sophisticated approach to defining the partof revenue and expenditure which is sensitive tothe cycle – what this does, for instance, is to con-solidate payments within the government sector,thereby not taking account of them as being cyc-lically induced.
Although the various procedures lead in some
cases to different assessments of the level of thecyclical influence on the general government
budget for the reasons cited above, the statementsregarding the year-on-year change in the cyclicalinfluence are for the most part very similar. The cal-culations made by the European Commission, theOECD and the IMF, as well as the disaggregatedapproach used here, all state that the reduction inthe deficit ratio by around 1
14percentage points
between 1997 and 2000 can be explained largelyby cyclical developments (see above chart). Thesubsequent rise of around 2
14percentage points in
2001 and 2002 are to a large degree regarded bythe various approaches as not cyclically induced.Year-on-year change in percentage points

32For this period, the Bundesbank’s approach shows
a lesser cyclical influence. Besides the factors listedabove, another factor worth mentioning is thatthe nominal budget components displayed a lessprofound cyclical impact, owing to opposing priceeffects, than the development of real GDP .
The sharp fluctuations in the “profit-related” taxes
between 1998 and 2002 (even if changes in taxlaw are taken into account) are seen as cyclicallyinduced to just a very minor extent by the
approaches being looked at here. This is attribut-able to the fact that some of the relevant factorsmay have been reflected in total GDP or in prop-erty and entrepreneurial income to only a verylimited extent. Generally, when judging budgetarydevelopments, other influences above and beyondthe cyclical adjustment procedure should be takeninto account.

The acceptance of deposits is the core area ofthe credit institutions’ traditional liability-sidebusiness. At the end of February 2003, non-bank deposits accounted for a share of justover 41
12% of total “liabilities to customers”,2
thus constituting the major source of fundingfor the German banks.
3Interbank liabilities, ie
amounts owed to other banks, are in secondplace (just under 32%), followed by securitisedliabilities (26
12%). The percentages vary con-
siderably in some cases, however, dependingon the category of bank. Whereas non-bankdeposits make up not quite 79% of credit co-operatives’ (and more than 70
12%o fs a v i n g s
banks’) liabilities to customers, non-bank de-posits account for a significantly lower percent-age in the case of institutions which transactbusiness mainly with other banks or on thecapital market, such as the regional institutionsof the credit cooperatives and the Land banks(just over 16
12%a n d2 512%, respectively). The
relevant figure for the commercial banks is justover 42%, which is a level similar to the aver-age across all banks.
From a monetary policy perspective, non-bank
deposits are especially interesting since theycan provide information on enterprises’ andhouseholds’ investment behaviour and liquid-ity. A rapid pace of growth in deposits maypoint to inappropriately generous financingconditions. Excessive liquidity may lead to un-desirably high rates of price increase. However,the scale of the inflation risks invariably de-pends on the causes of the increased liquidity.In this connection, a detailed analysis of thegrowth in deposits provides insights into which
types of deposit are showing a sharper trendincrease than others and how far an excessiveincrease in deposits is not just the result ofshort-term special effects that will not be re-flected in higher rates of inflation.
In this context, the deposits of “residents”
are therefore often the focus of interest.From the point of view of a participatingcountry, however, the concept of “resident”is no longer as clear-cut as it was before thestart of stage three of European monetaryunion. In an analysis of national bankingoperations that is geared to Germany, theresidents are, naturally enough, German de-positors. In order to determine the Germanbanking system’s contribution to the growthof deposits in the euro area, however, the de-posits of residents of other euro-area countries

institutions (Verordnung über die Rechnungslegung der

tions only “liabilities to customers” in this connection. All
non-securitised liabilities are to be shown as such liabilities
(section 21 (2)). In Regulation ECB/2001/13 of the Euro-
pean Central Bank of 22 November 2001 concerning the
consolidated balance sheet of the monetary financial insti-
tutions sector, the balance sheet item “deposits” is de-
fined as “Amounts owed to creditors by reporting agents,
other than those arising from the issue of negotiable se-
curities”.

vance.4Nevertheless, the quantitative differ-
ence between the two definitions is compara-tively small on the whole. With a share of9
12%, only the longer-term time deposits
(deposits with an agreed maturity of over twoyears) of non-banks from other euro-areacountries are on a significant scale.
5For the
other types of the deposit, the share is mostlyonly around 1 percentage point. At times,transfers of funds by residents of other euro-area countries may well have a more signifi-cant impact on the month-to-month changein German contributions to bank deposits inthe euro area, however.
The following analysis of deposits in Germany
will focus on the bank deposits of Germannon-banks at domestic credit institutions. Notonly will this give an idea of the longer-termdevelopments in German banks’ deposit busi-ness; it will also essentially make it possibleto identify special demand-side features inGerman investors’ investment behaviour.
Growth in bank deposits and its
determinants
The deposits at domestic banks of customers
resident in Germany have grown by anannual average of just over 5
12% since the
early 1980s. Given an average inflation6of
212%, this means that the increase in real
bank deposits was somewhat more than1 percentage point greater than the concur-rent rise in production potential in Germanyof just under 2%. On the whole, the dynam-ics of this development tended to be quitevaried, however. Although bank deposits
continued to grow fairly sharply in the 1980sand changes in them showed a comparativelylong cycle, the pace of expansion abated inthe 1990s and their development becamenoticeably more volatile. The average annualgrowth rate was 6% in the 1980s, 5% in theperiod from 1990 to 2002 and, in fact, nomore than 3% at the end of 2002.
This slower pace of growth may essentially be
explained in the context of the concurrentdecline in the rate of increase in aggregateexpenditure, which was reflected both in theaverage inflation rate falling from just under3% in the 1980s to 2% in the years thatfollowed and in slower real GDP growth.
7
The differential between average nominal in-come growth and the trend growth in de-posits has thus remained comparatively con-stant throughout the past two decades.
The estimate of a simple econometric model
for explaining the development in depositsinitially produces a fairly similar picture. Ananalysis was made of the long-term connec-
4In their monthly reports for the consolidated balance
sheet of the euro area, German MFIs therefore have to
provide data not only on their transactions with residents
in Germany but also on those with residents in other euro-
area countries. This breakdown is needed to obtain a co-
herent picture of the monetary situation for the euro area.
5Not only is this share comparatively large, it also fluctu-
ates noticeably over time. The funds invested by residents
of other euro-area countries at German banks are placed
with German banks’ foreign financial subsidiaries. For tax
reasons, these subsidiaries issue bank debt securities for
their own account and transfer the funds they receive to
their German parent institutions as a long-term time de-
posit.

37tion (cointegration relationship) between real
growth in deposits, on the one hand, and realgross domestic product (GDP) and an interestrate as a measure of the opportunity costs ofholding bank deposits, on the other.
For total deposits, the estimated income elas-
ticity is somewhat greater than 1 (1.07). As asimple time series comparison has alreadyshown, this means that real deposits aregrowing more rapidly than GDP . The (semi-)elasticity of the capital market rate is negative(-0.03), which permits an interpretation ofthe interest rate as a measure of the oppor-tunity costs.
However, a more nuanced analysis reveals a
certain amount of instability in the relation-ship, especially in the 1990s. Evidently, in thepast few years, other major factors determin-
ing the development of deposits have alsocome into play – determinants which cannotbe explained solely in terms of economicactivity and the interest rate level. The verysharp increase in overnight deposits since themid-1990s is responsible for a good part ofthis (see chart on p 39). Looking at the overallaggregate excluding the overnight deposits,the GDP elasticity of this modified develop-ment in deposits is not only nearer to 1; thestability of the entire estimate shows a signi-ficant improvement.

38factors, which have been inadequately cap-
tured by the simple specification chosen inthis instance.
A stable long-term relationship is also ob-
tained for some more narrowly defined sub-aggregates. A GDP elasticity of roughly 1 anda negative dependence on interest rates isproduced for the aggregate of short-termtime and savings deposits. By contrast, totaltime deposits show a disproportionately largegrowth with income and are also positivelycorrelated with the interest rate. The positiveinterest rate coefficient suggests that, in thisinstance, the capital market rate representsmore of a measure of the intrinsic rate ofreturn than of the opportunity costs.
Moreover, marked shifts among the various
types of deposit have occurred in the courseof time – not only when viewed over thelonger term but also in connection with theshorter-term, cyclical fluctuations in banks’deposit business. Particularly pronouncedcyclical movements are shown by the devel-opment of the short-term time deposits(deposits with an agreed maturity of up totwo years). Especially in periods of risinginterest rates, the market rates of interest onthis type of bank deposit make it an attractiveform of investment for private investors aswell as for large enterprises’ liquidity man-agement.
Particularly in the 1980s and the early 1990s,
this development was at the expense of theclassical savings deposit (with a statutoryperiod of three months’ notice), which up tothat time had fulfilled both cash-holding andEstimate of a long-term deposit

39investment functions for large sections of the
general public. Short-term savings depositswere comparatively easily available, mainlyowing to the possibility of withdrawing fundson a limited scale without prior notice, al-though the deposits were remunerated at arelatively low rate.
9Especially in the late
1980s and early 1990s – not least owing to agreater yield awareness on the part of savers– such deposits were increasingly shifted intoshort-term time deposits remunerated moreclosely in line with market rates. As a result,classical savings deposits’ share in the totalbank deposits of domestic non-banks fellfrom an average of 25% in the 1980s to justover 20% at the end of 1992.
10Since then,
however, the development has gone backinto reverse.
The new regulations on saving introduced in
1993 meant that credit institutions were ableto provide deposits redeemable at threemonths’ notice with more attractive termsand conditions as a “replacement” for theearlier savings passbook.
11In order to counter
the further erosion of their short-term refi-nancing, the banks made active use of thatpossibility. Subsequently, therefore, short-term savings deposits – mostly provided withan interest rate above the minimum or basicremuneration – were formed on a large scale(especially in periods of low interest rates),while short-term time deposits were, in someDM

9Savers were granted the right to withdraw a maximum
of DM3,000 per savings account and calendar month
from their savings balance without prior notice. The
amount is currently 32,000. Pursuant to section 21 of the
Directive on the accounting of banks and financial institu-
tions, any right to withdraw a larger amount than this
bars the deposit from being classified as a savings de-
posit.
10The sharp decline in short-term savings deposits in the
early 1990s was, however, also due in part to portfolio
adjustments in eastern Germany in the wake of intra-
German monetary union. Immediately after the introduc-
tion of the D-Mark in eastern Germany, east Germans
converted a considerable amount of their large savings
deposits holdings into cash or shifted them into other,
more attractively remunerated forms of investment.
At the end of 1990, holdings of deposits with a three-
month period of notice at credit institutions in eastern
Germany were less than half their initial value of
June 1990 (see Deutsche Bundesbank, The longer-term
trend in savings deposits and its implications for monet-
ary targeting, Monthly Report, May 1997, pp 50-51).
11The new provisions on saving which came into force
on 1 July 1993 introduced a wide-ranging deregulation
of savings in Germany. The previous statutory contractual
regulations were replaced by an accounting rule. This en-
abled the banks to offer any investment products under
the designation of “savings deposits”. (See Deutsche
Bundesbank, The longer-term trend in savings deposits
and its implications for monetary targeting, Monthly
Report , May 1997, p 44.)

1994 and mid-1997.12
An econometric study indicates that the shiftsin weight between time and savings depositsare indeed largely determined by a substitu-tion relationship between short-term timeand savings deposits which depends on theremuneration differential between these twotypes of deposit. According to the estimates,on an average of the period under review, a1 percentage point increase in the interestrate advantage of long-term time depositsproduced a relative decline in savings depositsof 22 percentage points.
13
In addition to the switches between short-term time and savings deposits, there havebeen shifts between short and longer-termtime deposits in recent years due to the inter-
est rate cycle. Particularly in the 1990s, therewas an observable divergent developmentbetween the expansion rates of deposits withan agreed maturity of up to two years anddeposits with an agreed maturity of over twoyears. At all events, estimates of the ratio oflonger-term to short-term time deposits pointto a substitution relationship of this kind be-tween the two cited maturity ranges, whichlikewise is mainly determined by the size ofthe relevant interest rate spread. Thus, on anaverage of the observation period, the ratioof longer-term to short-term time deposits –given a 1 percentage point decline in theinterest rate disadvantage of the short-termdeposits – decreased by 20 percentagepoints.
The maturity structure of deposits showed a
marked change throughout the interest ratecycle in any case. The outcome is that therewere pronounced shifts in the maturity struc-ture of deposits at the expense of longerlock-in periods. At the end of the observationperiod, no more than 35% of deposits wereLong-term determinants of domestic

12Savings accounts with temporary bonuses and special
savings schemes became increasingly popular. These
were offered in a variety of forms (one-off deposit or an
instalment-based saving scheme at fixed or variable rates
of interest, at rising interest rates or with a bonus on ma-
turity) and under a great number of designations (growth
saving, bonus saving, premium saving, target saving, sav-
ing with an add-on element, money market saving, yield
saving, multi-rate saving, etc). (See Deutsche Bundes-
bank, The longer-term trend in savings deposits and its
implications for monetary targeting, Monthy Report ,
May 1997, p 51).
13Cyclical developments appear to be irrelevant with re-
gard to this substitution relationship, since changes in
GDP have no significant effect on the equation. Remark-
ably, the explanatory power of this estimate is very high.

41in the longer-maturity range, compared with
just over 40% since the early 1990s and 46%in the 1980s. The invariably low rates of inter-est, along with the large degree of uncer-tainty following the slump in stock prices anddisappointing economic growth in recentyears, have encouraged domestic investors’preference for liquidity.
What is striking in this context is the sharp
growth in overnight deposits over the pastfew years. Up to the mid-1990s, their growthwas mostly similar to that of short-term sav-ings deposits. The rate of interest paid onboth types of deposit was lower than that onother bank deposits. They were therefore par-ticularly in demand in periods of low interestrates, as in the mid and late 1980s. Duringsuch periods, the amount of “forgone inter-est” associated with holding such deposits
was small and their ready availability was anadded advantage for potential investors.
Since the mid-1990s, there have been quite
diverging developments in overnight depositsand in deposits redeemable at three months’notice. While short-term saving deposits havebeen growing only at a declining rate, thepace of growth in German investors’ over-night deposits at domestic banks has acceler-ated markedly during the same period. Theincreased popularity of overnight deposits islikely to have been due not only to the loweralternative costs in the form of forgone inter-est for longer-term forms of investment(opportunity interest rate), but also (and prin-cipally) to the fact that attractively remuner-ated sight deposits have become more preva-%

42lent, ie to a relative increase in the intrinsic
rate of return. A lack of relevant data meansthat a direct empirical verification of this con-jecture is not possible, however.
14In the
econometric estimates for the overnight de-posits, this was therefore possible only in-directly by including an additional positivetime trend from 1994 onwards in order totake account of the described development.
15
This trend variable has proved to be signifi-cant, however.
The perceptibly higher percentage of over-
night deposits held by individuals at directbanks
16since the mid-1990s may also be
regarded as an indication of the increasingimportance of the intrinsic rate of return forthe attractiveness of overnight money. Eventhough the share of these deposits whichlargely carry a market rate of remuneration is
still small at present, at 6%, their dynamicpace of growth probably has to be seen inthe context of the general trend in competi-tion for short-term refinancing among thebanks. Direct banks have attracted overnightdeposits on a large scale precisely during thepast year; domestic individuals’ deposits atsuch institutions accounted for 22% of therise in German non-banks’ overnight depositsat domestic banks.
17
As mentioned above, however, the sharpexpansion in highly liquid bank deposits dur-ing the past few years is also due to a numberof special factors, which might decrease inimportance again in the course of time. TheSubstitution relationships between

14Rates paid on higher-yielding deposits of individuals
are surveyed as part of the Bundesbank’s interest rate
statistics ( Monthly Report , table VI.7), for which around
350 selected credit institutions submit reports. However,
as there are no available data on the underlying size of
these deposits, it is not possible to calculate a weighted
average interest rate for sight deposits. It may neverthe-
less be assumed that their remuneration – contrary to the
notion that overnight deposits are non-interest-bearing –
is identifiably positive on average. The minimum/basic
remuneration of savings deposits redeemable at three
months’ notice, ie relating to deposits which are subject
to little competitive pressure among the banks, potential-
ly provides quite a good lower limit for the average rate
of interest on overnight deposits.
15Furthermore, account is taken of a significantly nega-
tive jump in level in early 1994. In contrast to the positive
time trend, it is difficult to interpret this jump in economic
terms. It might be the result of the diminishing of in-
creased liquidity holding in the wake of the ERM crises
and the debate, conducted in 1992 and 1993, on the
introduction and provisions of an interest withholding tax.
16“Direct bank” is understood below as referring to
credit institutions which do not have a branch structure.
The specific marketing structures of such institutions are
generally marked by the offering of quite attractive terms
and conditions. The Bundesbank does not list a “direct
banks” category of banks in its banking statistics; the in-
formation stated here is based on the reports of eight
well-known direct banks domiciled in Germany.
17The sharp rise in overnight deposits remunerated at
market rates at direct banks in Germany last year was
probably due, not least, to a greater awareness of such
deposits resulting from an extensive advertising cam-

43sharp growth in overnight deposits in 2001
also has to be seen in the context of the re-duction in domestic currency hoarding thatoccurred in connection with the introductionof euro banknotes and coins. Last year, in-vestors are likely to have added largeamounts to their liquid bank deposits mainlyon account of the prevailing uncertainty.Besides the repeated setbacks on the stockmarkets, geopolitical risks were a significantfactor – especially in the second half of2002.
18In earlier years, overnight deposits in-
variably reacted sensitively to investor senti-ment characterised by uncertainty. Residentsbuilt up their liquidity holdings sharply for atime both during the debate on an interestwithholding tax in 1992-93 and in connectionwith the changeover to stage three of Euro-pean monetary union.
Bank deposits by group of depositor
Among the various groups of depositors, it
was mainly domestic individuals that formedsight deposits in 2002. As in 2001, this groupaccounted for around 70% of the increase inthis type of deposit during the course of theyear – a fact that can only be partially ex-plained by its likewise accounting for a highpercentage of the overnight deposits of thedomestic non-bank sector (63% at the end ofthe period under review).
In 2002, domestic enterprises gave prefer-
ence to overnight deposits and, above all,time deposits with an agreed maturity of upto two years. Much as in earlier periods ofrelatively low interest rates, growth in time
deposits was in double figures in some cases.
In the past, the expansion in short-term corpor-
ate deposits in Germany was also constantlybeing influenced by shifts of funds betweenGermany and the Euro-market. For a longtime, these shifts were due to foreign bankshaving an interest rate advantage stemmingfrom lower minimum reserve requirements inthe international banking centres of Luxem-bourg and London. As a result of the change-over to monetary union and the uniform min-imum reserve requirement throughout theeuro area, the institutions based in Luxem-Monthly

44bourg no longer enjoy this competitive edge.
Furthermore, the minimum reserve require-ment has been set at a very low level, whichmeans that the London centre’s competitiveadvantage has been minimised. This led to alarge-scale repatriation of short-term fundseven before the start of monetary union. In De-cember 1998 alone, there was a 312
12billion
decline in the short-term deposits invested byGerman non-banks at foreign subsidiaries andbranches of German banks. At the same time,the short-term time deposits of German enter-prises at domestic banks rose by 311 billion.

Funds from the Euro-market were being repat-
riated to Germany throughout 1999 as well.20
Deposits with an agreed maturity of over twoyears are likewise held predominantly by thecorporate sector. That also applies to registereddebt certificates issued by the banks. Except invery few periods, it was, above all, registereddebt certificates which contributed to the in-crease in domestic investors’ longer-term timedeposits. Deposits with an agreed maturity ofover two years held by enterprises as a share oftotal long-term time deposits has increasedfrom 35
12% in early 1980 to what is now
62%.21Corporate depositors are almost exclu-
sively insurance companies rather than produ-cing enterprises, however. Insurance companiesfavour using this form of asset for longer-terminvestment purposes in order to avoid the risksarising from impending price falls on the secur-ities markets and the accompanying value ad-justments on the balance sheet. In many cases,the above-mentioned registered bank debt cer-tificates were used. These are not listed on thestock market and can therefore be shown attheir face value on the balance sheet. In periodsof low interest rates, these investments thus
long had a particular role to play. Since themid-1990s, however, insurance companies’interest in this form of investment has wanednoticeably. Instead, the bull market which per-sisted until three years ago meant that insur-ance companies have temporarily investedmore heavily in securities.
At the end of the period under review, the de-
posits of German government at domesticbanks accounted for a relatively small share(5
12%) of the total deposits of domestic non-
banks. In the past, too, this holder group gener-ally played no more than a comparatively minorrole over a number of years. Longer-term in-vestment is, in any case, hardly a significant fac-tor in changes in general government deposits.Instead, the funds which the public sectorholds at banks are mainly designed to adjust itsongoing discontinuous revenue and expend-iture streams in the short term. The levels of de-posits fluctuate heavily from month to monthaccordingly. For many years, general govern-ment – like the corporate sector – used the in-vestment opportunities on the Euro-market for
19In December 1998, total deposits with an agreed ma-
turity of up to two years rose by more than 7% on the
month in seasonally adjusted terms.
20In 1999 as a whole, the decline in German non-banks’
short-term deposits at German banks’ subsidiaries and
branches abroad amounted to 333 billion, 316 billion of
which was accounted for by subsidiaries and branches in
the United Kingdom and 316 billion by subsidiaries and
branches in other EU countries (including 31312billion by
institutions in Luxembourg).
21If anything, this rise underestimates the corporate sec-
tor’s contribution to the growth of longer-term time de-
posits; since January 1999, deposits at building and loan
associations – which are held almost exclusively by indi-
viduals – have been recorded as deposits with an agreed
maturity of over two years. Excluding deposits at building
and loan association from a long-term comparison would
mean that enterprises’ share in longer-term time deposits
has more than doubled, ie from 3512% to just on 7212%.Longer-term

variably somewhat higher. During the past fewyears, holding deposits at foreign banks (muchas in the case of enterprises) has become per-ceptibly less important.
Summary and conclusions
On a multi-year average, the development of
deposits in Germany has been in a relativelystable relationship with overall economicgrowth. Nevertheless, over the past two dec-ades, notable structural shifts have occurredwithin those bank deposits. What is particu-larly striking in this context is the sharpgrowth in the short-term ranges of depositbusiness during the second half of the 1990s.This is probably due, in part, to remunerationbecoming more and more closely alignedwith market rates. Recently, however, uncer-tainty-induced liquidity holding has been aparticular major factor as well.
The fact that the sharp growth in short-term
deposits over the past two years is, indeed,an exceptional phenomenon, which cannotbe adequately accounted for by traditionalexplanatory factors and patterns of behaviour,can be demonstrated by the estimates pre-sented here. The major deviations of theactual level of deposits from their relevantlong-term explicable values – derived fromthe long-term relationship which has beenestimated using the cointegration analysis –are, at any rate, a clear indication of specialfactors which are reflected in such “portfolioeffects”. These special factors appear to havemainly promoted the sharp growth in over-night deposits. When estimating them, an
additional positive trend was taken intoaccount, which captures the longer-termshifts of weight in the structure of the de-posits quite well. Nevertheless, the deviationshere are currently between 3% and 4%above the level produced by the longer-termrelationships. In 1999 and in the first half of2000, the deviations were even somewhathigher, in fact. Germany’s entry into stagethree of monetary union and return flowsfrom the Euro-market caused an excessivelysharp rise in overnight deposits.

22In a more far-reaching analysis, where the long-term
analysis is embedded in a model that also takes account
of short-term adjustment effects, it additionally becomes
obvious that the undershooting of the overnight deposits
during the period from Q4 2000 to Q2 2001 is exagger-
ated in the above account. Using an error-correction
model, a much smaller underhang of sight deposits in
this period is obtained.

47German enterprises’
profitability andfinancing in 2001The difficult economic environment in
2001 had a substantial impact on cor-porate profitability. This can be seenfrom an evaluation of the first provi-sional results in the Bundesbank’s cor-porate balance sheet statistics for theproduction sector, the wholesale andretail trade and transport, which are atthe core of cyclical movements. Thegross return on turnover fell below its1997 level. The downturn in profitswas particularly marked in construc-tion and manufacturing. Higher an-nual results were achieved only by util-ities.
However, the decline in profitability did
not lead, all in all, to an erosion of theenterprises’ capital base in the yearunder review. Instead, enterprises madeup for the largely tax-related decline inthe own funds ratio in 2000 by retaininga large portion of their profits ratherthan distributing them. At all events,the own funds ratio was, at 17
12%, back
where it had been between 1997 and1999. Given the persistently unfavour-able economic situation, this should beseen as positive. However, there needsto be a further strengthening of equitycapital to bring about a lasting improve-ment in firms’ financial viability.

48Cyclical setting
2001 was a difficult year for the German
economy. After quite strong growth at thestart of the year, contractionary forces gainedthe upper hand as the year went on. Overall,real gross domestic product (GDP) rose byonly slightly more than
12%, after having ex-
panded by 3% in the preceding year. The in-crease in overall economic output was thuswell below that of potential output. As a re-sult, there was a perceptible decline in cap-acity utilisation and another output gapopened up.
The marked slowdown in the pace of macro-
economic growth in Germany is due primarilyto the global economic cooling which beganin the autumn of 2000 and was clearlypropelled further by the shock to sentimentgenerated by the terrorist attacks of 11 Sep-tember 2001. The global loss of confidenceand the prospect of a decrease in externaldemand resulted in German enterprisesreducing their investment significantly in2001. Although the large volume of ordersdating back to 2000 and the depreciation ofthe euro against other key currencies meantthat exports remained buoyant into thesummer, they also declined distinctly as theyear went on. Exports went up by 5% onaverage for the year. Although world tradegrowth was stagnating, German productsfurther increased their share of the globalmarket. As, at constant prices, there washardly growth in imports, the perceptible in-crease in real net exports boosted GDPgrowth by 1
12%.In addition to the deterioration of the inter-
national environment, home-grown factorsalso had a negative impact in 2001, with theongoing adjustment crisis in the constructionindustry taking the leading role. Althoughconsumption spending by private householdsand central government increased moderate-ly, this was not enough to offset the declinein fixed capital formation, with the result thatreal domestic demand decreased by justunder 1% on the year.
Wage policy, which has a major effect on
enterprises’ costs and expectations, was fullyappropriate to the difficult economic situ-ation in 2001. On an hourly and monthlybasis, the negotiated level of wages andsalaries went up by 2% on an overall aver-age; actual earnings went up by roughly thesame amount. In the year under review, em-ployee compensation, which includes grosswages and salaries and employers’ social con-tributions, was likewise 2% up on 2000.However, as corporate and investment incomepractically stagnated, the macroeconomiclabour income rate was, at 73
14%,14per-
centage point higher than one year previous-ly. There was also a somewhat sharper 1
12%
increase in unit labour costs owing to thecyclically induced slowdown in productivitygrowth.
The cyclical slowdown in 2001 affected the
production sector, the wholesale and retailtrade and transport taken together far morethan the economy as a whole. This is not sur-prising as the economic sectors analysed hereare the traditional focus of economic activity.Their real value added remained at the previ-Weak

porate sector which is not included in the cor-porate balance sheet statistics – especially pri-vate service providers – achieved growth ofjust over 3%.
1
However, the overall weak result of the seg-ment of the corporate sector analysed hereconceals major differences between the indi-vidual economic sectors. Manufacturing, forinstance, increased its real value added in2001 by a further
12%. Export-oriented
enterprises are likely to have fared betterthan those firms which mainly supply thedomestic market. In any case, according toofficial statistics, the export turnover expand-ed more strongly in terms of value – by 5% –than domestic turnover, which increasedby less than 2%; overall there was a 3%increase. The gap between foreign and do-mestic business was especially wide amongproducers of capital goods and durablegoods. Motor vehicle manufacturers, whichbelong to the first category, even increasedtheir foreign sales by 11
12%, as opposed to
512% in Germany. The overall weak growth
in industrial output in 2001 also affectedbusiness in “downstream” sectors. For in-stance, the demand for transport services(excluding communication) grew at a percep-tibly slower pace than in the preceding fouryears.
Real gross value added in the wholesale and
retail trade sector stagnated in 2001. Unlikethe two previous years, retail business faredsomewhat better than wholesale business.Turnover was nonetheless up 2% on the year,whereas it fell by 2
12% in the wholesaletrade. At constant prices, the growth gap
was roughly the same, with an increase of
12% as opposed to a decrease of 4%. The
volume of wholesale trade was declining inalmost all sub-sectors.
Economic output slowed in utilities and,
again, in the construction industry. In electri-city, gas and water supply, it was down
12%
on the year. This led to a 2% decrease in out-put in this sector in 2001 – not least owing tothe downward trend in intermediate goodsproduction, which is quite energy-intensive.The construction industry saw a continuationand intensification of the persistent contrac-tionary process which had begun in 1995.Real value added fell by 6
12% and was almost
one-fifth below its last peak in 1994. Therewas also a distinct decline in investment inhousing construction as well as in commercialand public sector construction.

marked expansion of the item “anticipated bank fees”,

50duction sector, trade and transport.2The an-
nual result before taxes on income fell by12
12% from its 2000 level.3This largely offset
the improvement in performance since 1996.At first glance this would seem to contrastwith the data in the national accounts on thedevelopment of profits of non-financial cor-porations, which recorded an increase of justunder 4% in 2001. When examined moreclosely, however – apart from the fact that forseveral reasons the two series are not fullycomparable – this confirms the aforemen-tioned diagnosis to the effect that the cyclicaldownturn had a greater impact on that partof the economy covered by the corporate bal-ance sheet statistics than on the services sec-tor, which is not included there. This againshows the great complexity of the Germaneconomy, which, in the context of a macro-economic analysis, may lead to wrong con-clusions being drawn.
The extent to which profitability deteriorated
in 2001 likewise becomes apparent if busi-ness expansion is also taken into account.The gross return on turnover (ie the ratio ofthe annual result before taxes on income toenterprises’ turnover) was, at just under 3%,almost
12percentage point down on the
comparable figure for 2000 and thus distinct-ly below its 1997 level. In this context, itshould also be borne in mind that there was asharp increase in the number of corporate in-solvencies in 2001. If the mainly low-profit-ability borderline firms which are no longercovered in the corporate balance sheet statis-tics are included, the profitability picture iseven bleaker.The annual result after tax decreased by
13%, ie even more strongly than the gross re-sult. The decisive factor was that the declinein the amount of tax on earnings did notkeep pace with the decline in taxable profit,as will be shown in greater detail below. Thenet return on turnover declined by
14percent-
age point to just under 2%. Note should,however, also be taken of the fact that theamount of tax on earnings includes, besidestrade tax, only corporation tax (including thesolidarity surcharge). The annual results ofpartnerships and sole proprietorships are,however, taxed as part of the entrepreneurs’private income and do not appear in thesefirms’ profit and loss accounts. The net returnon turnover shown here is therefore below itsactual value and merely gives an idea of thedevelopment of post-tax profitability.
In 2001 the downturn in profits was particu-
larly marked in the construction industry. Forthe first time since the series was started in

511987 (then covering western Germany only),
the figures, according to the preliminary cal-culations, were on balance no longer in theblack. In gross terms, profits and losses wereroughly in balance. After tax, losses amount-ed to
12% of turnover. The statistical diver-
gence from the gross result is due to the factthat the enterprises operating in the blackhad to pay tax on earnings while a large por-tion of the losses are only offset by subse-quent profits. What caused a further substan-tial erosion of earnings in the constructionsector was the fact that total output de-creased more strongly than the cost of mater-ials, which represents more than half of thetotal expenditure. Building enterprises wereclearly unable to pass on the increase in thecost of intermediate goods in constructionprices; at all events, the overall level of con-struction prices in 2001 was only 0.2% abovethat of 2000, while the corresponding produ-cer prices for building materials rose some-what more sharply and energy prices went upby 9%.
In 2001 manufacturing experienced the se-
verest downturn in profits since 1993. Theannual result before taxes on income declinedby nearly one-fifth and gross return on turn-over fell by just under 1 percentage point to3
12%. However, there is a marked difference
compared with 1993 in that gross earningswere then 1
12% of turnover. Earnings varied
quite considerably within the manufacturingsector. For example, there was a clear im-provement in the result for food products andbeverages. This was probably connected, atleast in part, to the market distortions andsubstitution processes at consumer level in%

52the wake of the animal diseases which had
led to a sharp upward surge in the prices ofanimal products. By contrast, things did notlook so good for motor vehicle manufactur-ers, for example, which experienced above-average earnings losses.
In 2001 profits also declined substantially in
the wholesale trade and in transport, al-though the decrease was less than in manu-facturing. However, it should be noted thatboth economic sectors have only relativelyweak income buffers. In fact, the gross returnon turnover has fallen in the wholesale tradeto 1
12% and in transport to 214%. Although
in 2001 the retail trade maintained its grossprofits at the 2000 level, this result was rela-tivised by the fact that the annual result be-fore tax has not risen since 1997. The corres-ponding return on turnover was virtually un-changed at just under 2%; this is roughlyequivalent to the average return in thesecond half of the 1990s.
By contrast, utilities firms increased their
profits in 2001. In electricity, gas and watersupply, the increase of nearly one-seventh inthe annual result before taxes on earningsdoes not initially tally with what has beennoted elsewhere, namely that the real valueadded fell in this sector. However, the nomin-al value added, which is of greater relevancehere, increased by 4
12%. Moreover, the en-
terprises managed to achieve substantial cutsin labour costs. This means that the profitmargin increased distinctly.

Income and cost in detail
In line with the distinct slowdown in econom-
ic growth in 2001, business growth in the en-terprises in the economic sectors analysed inthis article was far slower. Total output,which, in addition to turnover, also includeschanges in stocks of own products and othercapitalised production, increased by only1
12%, compared with 7% in the previous
year. In real terms, it is likely to have declined,given the 3% increase in producer prices forcommercial products, virtually stagnant con-struction prices and price rises of 1% in thewholesale and retail trade sector. None of theeconomic sectors analysed remained un-affected by the economic slowdown in busi-ness activities, even if utilities only lost rela-tively little dynamism. With certain excep-tions, this can also be said of the retail trade.The rate of growth in manufacturing fell from9% to around 3% and in transport from9
12%t o312%. In construction and the
wholesale trade, figures were well down onthe previous year.
Although, compared with 2000, interest re-
ceived and other income (which includes in-come from participating interests, profit andloss transfers and other operational income)again grew more strongly overall – by 6
12%–
than total output, less dynamism can be ob-served here, too. Special factors played a de-cisive role in that income from participatinginterests had a greater impact – about half asmuch again – on the profit and loss accounts
in 2000 than in 1999; this was due to thegreater distribution of retained profits amongaffiliated enterprises. This level was distinctlyundershot in 2001, when the distribution ofretained profits decreased further. In 2001total income was 2% up on the previousyear, having increased by 7%.
Total cost went up by 2
12% in 2001, ie more
sharply than total income. The comparativelysharp increase in costs was due primarily tointerest paid and other cost. Other cost in-cludes rent and leasing expenditure, researchand development costs, advertising expensesand transfers to special reserves; it accountsfor roughly one-seventh of total cost.
At just over 2%, the rate of increase in the
cost of materials was
34percentage point
above the increase in total output. Conse-quently, gross earnings were more than
12%
above the previous year’s level, having in-creased by just over 2
12%.4The share of the
cost of materials in total output therefore in-creased perceptibly to 64
12%, from an aver-
age of 6212% between 1996 and 1999.
This development, which can be observed in
all economic sectors analysed in this articleapart from the wholesale and retail trade,seems to have occurred for different reasonsin different sectors. In manufacturing, a
4The definition of gross earnings diverges from the nom-

goods. The relevant services not included (eg advertising
expenses, insurance premiums etc) are entered under the

54major contributory factor is likely to have
been the tendency towards a narrowing ofmanufacturing penetration which has beenevident for some time. The motor vehicle in-dustry is in the forefront here, with cost ofmaterials amounting to 71% in 2001, as op-posed to 64
12% in 1996. In utilities, there
was again a two-figure increase in the cost ofmaterials in 2001. However, the lagged priceadjustment for gas was a key factor here. Gasimport prices went up by around 35% onaverage, while euro-denominated prices ofcrude oil and mineral oil products declinedperceptibly after the dramatic increase in2000. Although the cost of materials declinedin the construction industry, total outputslowed even more, with the result that here,too, the cost of materials – starting from50% in the mid-1990s – went up to 52
12%.
This likewise reflects a reduction in manufac-turing penetration, which plays a greater rolein construction mainly because of subcon-tracting.
It is in keeping with this basic picture that the
12% increase in labour cost in 2001 was far
less than the expansion of business activitiesand that the importance of this cost item de-clined further. However, this is not only dueto the changes in the division of labour be-tween enterprises outlined above, but is alsoconnected to the moderate wage rises re-ferred to earlier in this article. In addition, thelabour cost burden on enterprises was easedsomewhat from 1 January 2001 by the slightreduction in the rate of the employers’ contri-butions to the statutory pension insurancescheme.The rise in unemployment had a far stronger
impact in that part of the corporate sectoranalysed in this article, reducing labour cost;nonetheless, in the economy as a whole newjobs were still being created on balance. Con-struction was again the focus of job cuts,with nearly 8% fewer people being employedthan in 2000. Next came utilities with a de-crease of 4
12%. However, unlike construc-
tion, this is less a reflection of a critical eco-nomic situation than of greater pressure torationalise following the opening-up of theelectricity market and the concomitant in-crease in competition. Manufacturing andtrade more or less maintained their employ-ment position as an annual average in 2001and in transport a few new jobs were cre-ated.
The 2
12% increase in depreciation is due sole-
ly to the sudden rise (+2512%) in “other de-
preciation”, which mostly comprises uncol-lectable debtors plus write-downs on invest-ments and participating interests. Amongother things, this probably reflects the pricelosses in the equity markets, some of whichwere huge and which caused some enter-prises to make corresponding value adjust-ments at the end of the financial year. Thebalance sheet decrease in the value of tan-gible fixed assets was, however, down by1
12%. One factor was the marked decline in
gross fixed asset formation, its level affectingdepreciation costs in the year of purchase.The second factor was that, for the purposeof counter-financing “Tax reform 2000”which took effect from 1 January 2001, thetax depreciation allowances for investment inmachinery and equipment and commercialLabour cost ...... deprecia-

Interest rate expenditure by production enter-prises again went up sharply in 2001, by12%. This was due, in part, to the holdingsof creditors with an effect on interest beingdistinctly expanded in 2001 as an annualaverage. Short-term lending increased by4
12% and long-term borrowing by12%. This
growth differential affected the volume oftotal interest paid in that the short-term lend-ing rates were perceptibly higher in 2001than in the previous year, while long-termlending undershot the average level of 2000.In addition, owing to the shorter commit-ment period, the increase in short-term inter-est rates passes through to interest paid morequickly than the decline in long-term rates.The average debit interest rate to be paid byenterprises was therefore, at 5
34%, well up
on the year. Net interest paid increased bymore than one-tenth in 2001. The strongergrowth of interest received than that of inter-est paid was more than offset by the fact thatinterest received traditionally evolves at a farlower level than the corresponding cost item.
The tax burden on enterprises’ earnings went
down by 10
12% in 2001, after declining by
1% and 112% in the preceding two years.
This is, first, related to a mainly cyclically in-duced downturn in gross profits. Second, thereform of corporation tax which took effecton 1 January 2001 brought considerable netrelief. The linchpin is the reduction in the cor-porate tax rate from 40% for retained profitsand 30% for distributed profits to a uniform25%. Although lower income tax rates and
the partial inclusion of trade tax in income taxmeant that the reform also gave partnershipssome relief at the start of 2001 as their in-come is subject to “private” taxation, thiswas not reflected in their profit and loss ac-counts. In order to gain a broader picture ofthe corporation tax reform which took effectin 2001, account also needs to be taken ofthe changes in the depreciation rules present-ed above.
Under “other taxes”, which includes, inter
alia, taxes on land and buildings, motor ve-
hicle tax and excise taxes, enterprises had topay 5
12% more than one year previously.
Given that business development was sub-dued, the sharp increase is mainly due to thethird increase in energy taxation which tookeffect at the start of 2001 as part of the “eco-logical tax reform”.
Balance sheet trends and key balance
sheet ratios
In 2001 the weak economic environment and
unfavourable performance figures had a clearimpact on the corporate balance sheet. Theadjusted balance sheet total
6went up by
212% only, after having increased by 6% in
the previous year. In the construction sector,assets and liabilities decreased again – by
5The change in the depreciation modalities is a factor
here in that the bulk of the annual accounts covered by

566%, even more than in the previous year. The
wholesale trade also recorded a decrease, al-beit distinctly moderate. In some of the othereconomic sectors, the pace of growth sloweddown considerably.
On the assets side, slower growth in both
non-financial and financial assets was respon-sible for the flattening-out of balance sheetgrowth. At the end of financial year 2001,the stock of tangible assets was only 1
12%
above its 2000 level. Between 1998 and2000 it increased by 4% on average. Themarked slowdown in growth affected “intan-gible assets”, which, for example, includepurchased patents, concessions, copyrightand software. In particular, the sharp increasein purchases of software products between1998 and 2000, the years of the “new econ-omy” euphoria, gave a high two-figure boostto the average nominal value. Owing to thegeneral disillusionment which has since set inand the overcapacities created at the end ofthe 1990s, such large reductions in invest-ment were made in 2001, however, that thefigures for intangible assets were only 5
12%
up on the previous year.
The stock of movable tangible assets was ex-
panded by around12%. The growth of this
balance sheet item, which has been subduedfor some time, is likely to be connected withthe increasing importance of leasing ratherthan purchasing machinery and equipment.In 2001 inventories were also expanded farless than in previous years, by 1
12%. The de-
cline in construction activity also played a rolein that the items allocated to inventories –“payments on account and tangible assets inEnterprises’ balance sheet*

57course of construction” and “contracts in
progress” again decreased dramatically in theconstruction industry.
Although, at 3
12%, financial assets expanded
far more slowly in 2001 than in previousyears, their growth was stronger than that oftangible fixed assets. Their share in the bal-ance sheet total therefore continued to in-crease and, at 52%, was 5 percentage pointshigher than in 1994, from when data for Ger-many as a whole are available. However, thisaverage variable fails to show the substantialdifferences between the individual segments.The range is from 33% in construction to57
12% in manufacturing and 5812% in util-
ities; it mainly reflects the strongly divergentimportance of participation interests, whichamounted to only 2
12% in construction com-
pared with 17% in manufacturing and 19%in utilities.
The reduced expansion of financial assets in
2001 is due, on the one hand, to the rela-tively low expansion of short-term debtors,which, in turn, related to the 3% decline intrade debtors. The corresponding trade cred-itors even fell by 4
12% in 2001. Experience
has shown that the two items fluctuate quitewidely over the business cycle. In periods ofeconomic cooling, an important factor, inaddition to less dynamic business growth, isthat suppliers are affected more by bad debtsarising from insolvency and, given the in-creased risk of debtor default, try to keeptheir accounts receivable as low as possible.
On the other hand, the book values for secur-
ities fell by well over one-tenth. This probablyreflects both net sales and extensive value ad-
justments, which had become necessary afterthe collapse of equity market prices. In add-ition, participating interests, which hadgrown by around one-sixth on average be-tween 1998 and 2000, expanded relativelymoderately, by 3
12%.
At first glance, the fact that enterprises sub-
stantially increased their own funds by 412%
in 2001 does not fit in the gloomy picture ofincome. In particular, provisions were expand-ed by 6
12%, after having increased by only
3% in 2000 owing to the aforementionedtransfer effect. A closer examination revealsthat financial resources which accrued to theenterprises in 2001 from the issuance of newshares remained roughly as in the previousyear. By contrast, there was a considerablechange in the appropriation of profits, withprofit retention being favoured. In the annualaccounts of corporations in the economicsectors analysed in this article, only half ofthe unusually high volume was made avail-able for distribution to the shareholders. The(vertical) own funds ratio, which fell slightly in2000, therefore went back up to 17
12% and
thus to the level of the period from 1997 to1999.
The increase in profit retention reflects, first,
a certain normalisation of the appropriationof profits following the marked tax-inducedincrease in the profits proposed for distribu-tion in the balance sheets for financial year2000. A second factor may have been that,as a result of the reform of corporation tax,self-financing as opposed to external finan-cing is favoured far more than was previouslyFinancial assets

58the case. This may be considered a positive
development in the present situation in whichthe equity market is demonstrating a limitedcapacity to absorb issues. In the long term,the tax preference for profit retention, how-ever, weakens the allocation function of thecapital markets.
In 2001 the increase in creditors lagged
somewhat behind balance sheet growth. Thedecisive factor here was that the long-termcreditors were expanded only slightly. In thisconnection, however, it is worth noting thatthe increase in short and long-term debtorsvis-à-vis credit institutions, taken together,kept pace with the creditors. From that per-spective, at least for 2001 the annual ac-counts analysed in this article provide no evi-dence of a general withdrawal by the banksfrom corporate financing. At 20%, the provi-sions, which were expanded by 3
12%, more
or less retained their share of the balancesheet total; two-fifths accrued to provisionsfor pensions.
In addition to the equity capital ratio, other
key figures indicate that the capital structureof enterprises in 2001 at least did not worsen.Long-term available capital – as in 2000 – ac-counted for around 42
12% of the total liabil-
ities and was again 2% above the fixedassets. In addition, the coverage of liquiditiesand short-term debtors increased in relationto short-term creditors by
12percentage point
to 7612%. By contrast, the ability of enter-
prises to pay their debts fell further in 2001.The figures which provide information aboutthat, ie the ratio of internally generated fundsto borrowed funds (excluding cash), wentBalance sheet ratios*

59down by 1 percentage point to 1212%; the
ratio had been 1412% in 1999.
The economic slowdown which began in the
second half of 2000 had a marked impact oncorporate profits in the economic sectorsanalysed in this article. Construction was par-ticularly affected since the pressure on theprofit and loss account caused by the struc-tural crisis was further compounded by thecyclical downturn. The enterprises’ overallprofitability (measured in terms of return onturnover) declined perceptibly in 2001. Pre-liminary information indicates that in 2002the persistent near-stagnation of the econ-omy as a whole cast a further shadow overthe earnings picture. However, the improve-ment in the terms of trade is likely to have
brought some relief to the enterprises’ annualaccounts.
The enterprises did not allow worsening prof-
itability in 2001 to pass through to their cap-ital base. As a result of the increased reten-tion of profits, it proved possible to offset the2000 tax-related decline in own funds. Forthis to be achieved in an economically diffi-cult year such as 2001 is a positive sign. A fur-ther strengthening of the capital base is,however, imperative to firm up the enter-prises’ “shock resistance” and to keep exter-nal financing premiums low when borrowingfunds, especially from banks.

69Financial sanctions:
legal frameworkand implementationin GermanyWith the outbreak of the second Gulf
war, the financial sanctions imposedon Iraq by the United Nations in 1990again became a focus of public atten-tion. On 20 March 2003 the Presidentof the United States ordered the seiz-ure of frozen account balances of vari-ous Iraqi public institutions. In Ger-many the Deutsche Bundesbank askedthe banking industry to report all bankaccounts, safe custody deposits orother assets belonging to Iraq, officialbodies in Iraq or their authorised rep-resentatives. In the light of theseevents, this article gives an overview ofthe legal framework of the financialsanctions which have been imposed bythe United Nations, the EuropeanUnion or European Community andthe national authorities and which cur-rently apply in Germany and an outlineof the role played by the DeutscheBundesbank in their implementation.It also deals with the closure of anexisting regulatory gap.

70Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,3Burma/
Myanmar4and Zimbabwe5are currently in
force in Germany. The financial sanctionsagainst Libya are currently suspended. Thesesanctions are partly governed by Communitylaw and partly by national law. They also donot have a common regulatory structure. Forthat reason a few basic comments will firstbe made and then individual aspects of thevarious financial sanctions will be examined.
Legal framework and regulatory
structures of financial sanctions
Nowadays financial sanctions may originate
in measures undertaken by the United Na-tions (UN) or the European Union. If they arebased on measures taken by the UN, it mustbe remembered that the UN cannot legislatedirectly in its member states. In accordancewith Article 41 of the Charter of the UnitedNations, the UN Security Council can simplydecide to impose sanctions on a country;these must then be implemented by themember states in accordance with Article 48of the UN Charter. In the EU member statesthese sanctions are implemented regularly bylegal instruments at EU/Community level, thereason being that the authority which EUmember states originally possessed to adoptmeasures to restrict capital movements andpayments was transferred to the Communitywhen the Maastricht Treaty came into force.Apart from embargoes which had been im-posed before the Treaty came into force andwhich are still valid, any authority that theEU member states still have to adopt financialsanctions is restricted to exceptional cases.Regardless of whether the imposition of
financial sanctions was due originally to a(political) decision by the UN Security Councilor by the Council of Ministers within theframework of the EU’s common foreign andsecurity policy, implementation at the Com-munity level follows the same procedure. Ini-tially, joint actions (Article 14 of the EUTreaty
6) or common positions (Article 15 of

ables a member state, for serious political rea-sons and on grounds of urgency, to take uni-lateral measures to restrict capital movementsand payments as long as the Council ofMinisters has not taken any measures. InGermany this is the responsibility of the Fed-eral Ministry of Economics and Labour. It hasexercised this option several times in the pastand, in agreement with the Federal ForeignOffice and the Federal Ministry of Finance aswell as in consultation with the Bundesbank,has adopted restrictive (emergency) measuresby virtue of section 2 (2) and section 7 (1) ofthe Federal Foreign Trade and Payments Act.As a rule, these (emergency) measures imple-ment sanctions with a minimum of delay andare taken ahead of measures agreed by theEuropean Union or the European Community.The national restrictions imposed on the basisof the Foreign Trade and Payments Act are re-pealed once relevant measures under Euro-pean law have come into force.
Classic targets of financial sanctions are third
countries such as Burma/Myanmar or Zim-babwe. This can be seen from the authori-sation principles under Community law laiddown in Article 60 and Article 301 of the ECTreaty, which deal with the suspension ofeconomic relations with one or more thirdcountries. In view of the efforts being madeto combat the financing of terrorism, how-ever, recent sanctions have also increasinglybeen directed at natural persons or groups ofpersons without any explicit connection tothird countries. In this respect, a distinctionhas to be made between persons and groupsof persons identified by the Sanctions Com-mittee of the United Nations in accordance
with UN Security Council Resolutions 1267(1999) and 1390 (2002)
8and such persons
and groups of persons on whom the EUmember states have been imposing sanctionsindependently by virtue of UN Security Coun-cil Resolution 1373 (2001) and who are listednot by the UN but by the EU.
9
If the persons or groups of persons listed bythe EU have their main place of residencewithin the EU, however, the measures amountto nothing more than providing the greatestpossible degree of administrative assistance inpreventing and combating terrorist attackswithin the framework of police and judicialcooperation in criminal matters. Owing to theabsence of links with third countries, there isno basis under Community law for authoris-ing more radical measures here. Any such jus-tification exists only in the case of listed per-sons or groups of persons domiciled outsidethe EU; the measures cited in footnote 1 aredirected at these persons alone.
The various legal instruments governing
financial sanctions vary slightly in respect ofthe assets covered by the financial sanctions.As a rule, they involve funds and economicresources of the countries or the group ofpersons in question. The term “funds” withinthe meaning of Community law covers not

72only cash, cheques, claims on money, drafts,
money orders or other payment instrumentsbut also, for example, instruments of exportfinancing. Economic resources are defined inthese legal instruments as assets of any kindwhich, regardless of whether they are tan-gible or intangible and movable or immov-able, are not funds but which can be used toacquire funds, goods or services.
Funds and economic resources are frozen by
virtue of the legal instruments governing thefinancial sanctions in order to prevent furtheruse of the assets. The ownership and otherrights with regard to these funds and eco-nomic resources remain unchanged.
Financial sanctions also regularly prohibit mak-
ing funds directly or indirectly available to thecountries or group of persons concerned.Additionally, one legal instrument prohibitedthe provision of financial services. Some ofthese legal instruments permit exceptions tobe made, for example, on humanitariangrounds. However, the exemptions and pro-cedures to achieve these vary.
The Federal Ministry of Economics and La-
bour bears the main responsibility for mattersconnected with the implementation of finan-cial sanctions as part of foreign trade andpayments law. In individual cases, it consultsthe Federal Foreign Office, the Federal Minis-try of Finance and the Bundesbank. The Bun-desbank assumes a special role with respectto financial sanctions. Pursuant to sec-tion 28 (1) read in conjunction with (2) num-ber 1 of the Foreign Trade and Payments Act,it has sole responsibility in the field of capitalmovements and payments for granting
authorisations by virtue of the Foreign Tradeand Payments Act and the regulations issuedin connection with this Act and by virtue oflegislation enacted by the Council and theCommission of the European Community.Accordingly, Community legislation namesthe Bundesbank as the responsible authorityin Germany for matters concerning capitalmovements and payments.
Both the Foreign Trade and Payments Act and
the legal instruments governing financialsanctions under Community law grant thebodies responsible for implementing financialsanctions the right to collect information,especially information from credit institutionson frozen funds and other assets. This rightto demand information was first exercisedin connection with the financial sanctionsagainst the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
Sections 33 and 34 of the Foreign Trade and
Payments Act provide for the possible punish-ment of infringements against financial sanc-tions either as a breach of administrativeregulations or as a criminal offence, depend-ing on the type of legal instrument governingthe financial sanctions.

adopted before the Treaty came into forceand those adopted afterwards.
Financial sanctions against Libya and IraqThe financial sanctions which were enacted
prior to the entry into force of the MaastrichtTreaty and which are still relevant are themeasures against Libya and Iraq. While no de-cision has so far been taken on the final re-peal of the sanctions against Libya whichwere suspended in April 1999, the sanctionsagainst Iraq still apply. It is against this back-ground that one is to see sections 52 and 69eof the Foreign Trade and Payments Regula-tion which are based on section 7 (1) of theForeign Trade and Payments Act. These sec-tions were added to the Foreign Trade andPayments Regulation immediately after theIraqi attack on Kuwait in August 1990, theirpurpose being to implement Resolution 661(1990) of the UN Security Council. Pursuantto section 52 of the Foreign Trade and Pay-ments Regulation, bank accounts, safe cus-tody deposits or other assets that are held insafe custody or are managed and which be-long to Iraq, official bodies in Iraq or theirauthorised representatives are “blocked” inGermany in such a way that access to suchassets requires the authorisation of the Bun-desbank. Additionally, payments to the afore-mentioned group of persons and personsclosely associated with that group, amongothers, require authorisation which is subjectto the permissibility conditions laid down insection 69e of the Foreign Trade and Pay-ments Regulation.Authorisations to release assets that had
been blocked under the Iraqi embargo weregranted by the Bundesbank in individualcases in the past. This was done, for example,to enable German enterprises to enforceclaims that had arisen prior to August 1990,for purposes associated with operationsauthorised by the United Nations outside thescope of the “oil-for-food” programme andfor withdrawals from accounts held by theIraqi embassy for use by the embassy.
The granting of authorisations described
above has no connection with the UnitedNation’s oil-for-food programme. This pro-gramme is aimed at generating funds fromthe sale of oil to buy, for example, humanitar-ian goods and to repay Iraq’s war debts. Theproceeds from the sale of oil are credited to atrust account which was set up by theSecretary-General of the United Nations andwhich is not operated in Germany. In prin-ciple, all payments associated with this pro-gramme have to be made from this account.

74to these sanctions reflect the developments in
the Balkan conflict and the political stance ofthe European Union in this conflict. The sanc-tions were limited in November 2000; sinceJune 2001 they apply only to Mr SlobodanMilosevic and 12 of his close associates. Thesanctions imposed in May 2000 and in Febru-ary 2002 against Burma/Myanmar andZimbabwe are to be seen as the EU’s reactionto the continuing serious and systematichuman rights abuses carried out by theBurmese authorities and the government ofZimbabwe.
It is worth mentioning in respect of these
sanctions that the scope for granting exemp-tions is limited. While the financial sanctionsagainst Burma/Myanmar contain no exemp-tions, exemptions are permitted as far as thefinancial sanctions against the Federal Repub-lic of Yugoslavia and Zimbabwe are con-cerned although the rulings on these vary. Noapplications for the granting of exemptionsunder the currently valid regulations have sofar been submitted to the Bundesbank.
Financial sanctions against the Taliban of
Afghanistan and to combat terrorism
In the light of the terrorist attacks of 11 Sep-
tember 2001, the financial sanctions whichwere imposed on the Taliban of Afghanistanand those which were designed to combatterrorism, thus implementing the sanctionsimposed by the UN Security Council, are ofparticular importance.
Seen in a historical context, the sanctions
against certain persons and entities associ-ated with Usama bin Laden, the Al-Qaida net-
work and the Taliban of Afghanistan go backto the Afghanistan embargo of February2000, which was intensified in March 2001and lifted in May 2002. After the terrorist at-tacks in the United States the appendix to theEC regulation governing the sanctions, inwhich the persons and organisations coveredby the sanctions are listed, was changedthrough eight further regulations. In anticipa-tion of these regulations, the Federal Ministryof Economics and Labour, in consultationwith the Bundesbank and other authorities,had issued restrictive measures that werebased on the Foreign Trade and Payments Actand took the form of general administrativeacts. As a result, access to assets of namedpersons and organisations and payments byGerman residents to these persons and or-ganisations were made subject to the approv-al of the Bundesbank. These measures wererepealed after the names of the persons con-cerned had been added to the annex of theaforementioned EC regulation.
The restrictive measures that were directed
against certain persons and organisations inan effort to combat terrorism are likewise tobe seen in connection with the attacks inthe United States in September 2001. Thesefinancial sanctions implement UN SecurityCouncil Resolution 1373 (2001). The EU listof the persons and organisations affected bythe sanctions has been changed three timesso far. The measures conform to the modeldescribed in this article.

European Union’s regulatory authority
restricted with respect to “internalEU terrorists”
Reference has been made in connection with
the comments on targets of financial sanc-tions to the restricted regulatory authority ofthe European Union with respect to thosepersons and groups of persons who are to besubject to sanctions in the course of imple-menting UN Security Council Resolution 1373(2001) and whose domicile is within the EU(“internal EU terrorists”). The legal instru-ments governing the financial sanctions de-scribed so far does not cover this area, withthe result that a regulatory gap still exists. Itwould seem appropriate to close this regula-tory gap through a regulation enshrined inthe Foreign Trade and Payments Act, whichwould likewise be implemented by the Bun-desbank. Even though both cross-border
matters and purely internal German mattersthat do not come within the scope of the For-eign Trade and Payments Act are involved,the Foreign Trade and Payments Act is theproper place for such a regulation. Even inthe case of domestic matters, a restriction ofthe capital movements and payments of thepersons concerned is involved, with the resultthat there is an internal practical connectionto the Foreign Trade and Payments Act. Toavoid additional bureaucratic red tape and adivision of responsibilities that would be diffi-cult for outsiders to understand, especially ina regulatory matter that is already compli-cated enough, it is probably advisable not tocreate any new areas of public responsibilitiesbut, instead, to use existing structures andthe available experience for this area of sanc-tions, too. In the end, national responsibilityfor implementing sanctions should not de-pend on whether the person or group of per-sons concerned happens to have their usualplace of domicile outside or inside the Euro-pean Union or in Germany.

*These euro area retail bank interest rates should be used with caution and Member States. Furthermore, the national interest rates are not harmonised
for statistical purposes only, primarily to analyse their development over in terms of their coverage (new business and/or outstanding amounts), th e
time rather than their level. They are calculated as the weighted average of nature of the data (nominal or effective) or the compilation method. Thenational interest rates provided by the national central banks. The national country weights for the euro area retail bank interest rates are derived from
rates represent those rates that are currently available from national MFI balance sheet statistics or close proxies. The weights reflect thesources and which are judged to fit the standard categories. These national country-specific proportions of the relevant instruments within the eur o
rates have been aggregated to derive information for the euro area, in area, measured as outstanding amounts. The weights are adjusted monthly,some cases relying on proxies and working assumptions due to the so that interest rates and weights always refer to the same month. — 1En-
