Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The German economy is likely to have grown 
moderately in the first quarter of 2019. Domes -
tic one-  off effects were likely to have been a 
key factor here, however. The already booming 
construction sector benefited additionally from 
the favourable weather in February. Further -
more, private consumption has probably 
emerged from the weak spell seen in the 
second half of 2018. It was buoyed by the fiscal 
measures entering into force at the turn of the 
year which enhanced consumers’ scope for 
spending. This is reflected in the recent signifi -
cant rise in retail sales. Additional boosts to pri -
vate consumption probably came from brisk 
passenger car sales. Consumers evidently 
caught up on new car purchases, which they 
had postponed in the autumn due to the 
limited range of models on offer. The automo -
tive industry was hit by difficulties with the 
introduction of a new emissions test procedure 
(Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test 
Procedure: WLTP) at the time. However, not 
taking these one- off effects into consideration, 
the underlying trend of the German economy 
remains subdued. This is mainly due to the pro -
tracted downturn in industrial activity, with 
new orders plummeting towards the end of 
the period under review and sentiment among 
enterprises becoming even gloomier, according 
to the ifo Institute.
Industry
Industrial output remained lacklustre in Febru -
ary 2019 and after seasonal adjustment was 
down slightly by ¼% on the month. The figure 
for January had been revised upwards distinctly 
but on an average of January and February in -
dustrial output was still perceptibly lower than 
the level of the previous quarter (-½%). There was a relatively broad decline in industrial pro -
duction but German manufacturers of machin -
ery had to cope with particularly significant 
losses of output. Output in the automotive in -
dustry was also down distinctly on the fourth 
quarter of 2018. Data on the numbers of 
manufactured passenger cars (available to 
March) provided by the German Association of 
the Automotive Industry (VDA) indicated a con -
traction in the seasonally adjusted output of 
motor vehicles on an average of the first quar -
ter of 2019 overall. This would mean no not -
able catch- up effects in the sector following 
extensive output losses in the second half of 
2018 in the wake of the introduction of the 
WLTP test. The normalisation was obviously 
masked by weaker global demand for motor 
vehicles. Domestic passenger car production 
may also have recently been shifted to other 
European countries. Overall, the production of 
capital, intermediate and consumer goods de -
clined fairly evenly across the board in January 
and February compared with the previous 
quarter.
German industrial orders suffered a strong set -
back in February 2019 and slumped by 4¼% on 
the previous month in seasonally adjusted 
terms. Looking at January and February in ag -
gregate, incoming orders were also down sub -
stantially on the previous quarter (-3¾%). 
There was a particularly strong decline (-6½%) 
in demand for German products in non- euro 
area countries, with orders for motor vehicles 
especially hard hit (-13¼%). By contrast, motor 
vehicle orders in euro area countries (+6%) and 
in Germany (+3¼%) provided positive momen -
tum. These increases are probably in connec -
tion with WLTP- related catch- up effects after 
motor vehicle orders were down significantly 
around the middle of 2018 as a result of the 
new EU-  wide emissions tests. Nevertheless, 
German industrial enterprises reported a steep 
decline in orders from the euro area overall 
(-4½%). The decrease in domestic orders was German econ -
omy likely to 
have grown 
moderately in

smaller (-1%). With regard to the individual sec -
tors, the capital goods sector saw the strongest 
contraction in orders (-4¾%). That said, inter -
mediate and consumer goods producers re -
ceived significantly fewer new orders, too 
(-2½% and -1½% respectively).
In February 2019, German industrial sales were 
significantly lower in terms of value, with nom -
inal sales down by 1% on the month after sea -
sonal adjustment. However, on an average of 
January and February, they did not match the 
lacklustre industrial output but rose steeply 
compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 
(+1¼%). This was largely attributable to the 
strong growth in non- euro area countries. By 
contrast, sales in the euro area failed to surpass 
the level of the previous quarter. In Germany, 
sales rose to the same extent as the average of 
the various regions. With regard to the individ -
ual sectors, sales in the capital goods sector 
showed particularly strong growth against the 
background of brisk motor vehicle sales. Sig -
nificantly more modest growth in sales was re -
corded by manufacturers of consumer goods. 
Sales in the intermediate goods sector were 
even down distinctly on the previous quarter. In 
line with the path followed by sales, nominal 
goods exports in February 2019 declined sub -
stantially on the month in seasonally adjusted 
terms (-1¼%). Looking at January and February 
together, however, they increased perceptibly 
(+½%) in quarter- on- quarter terms. After ad -
justment for price effects, there was a some -
what stronger rise (+¾%). In February, nominal 
imports of goods were also down steeply on 
the previous month’s level in seasonally ad -
justed terms (-1¾%) but they rose distinctly in 
January and February compared with the previ -
ous quarter (+½%). At 2%, growth was much 
greater still when adjusted for price effects. 
This discrepancy is attributable to the decline in 
prices for energy imports at the turn of the 
year.Industrial sales

Construction industry
Construction output rose very sharply in Febru -
ary 2019, and was up by 6¾% on the previous 
month in seasonally adjusted terms. However, 
a key reason for this increase is probably the 
particularly favourable weather in the reporting 
month. On an average of January and February, 
construction output was likewise up quite con -
siderably on the previous quarter (+4¼%). Ac -
tivity in the main construction sector and the 
finishing trades grew on a comparable scale 
(+4½% and +4% respectively). Even leaving 
aside the positive weather effects, the brisk 
construction activity in Germany is expected to 
continue. New orders received by the main 
construction sector in January 2019 – data are 
available up to this date  – even rose slightly 
(+¼%) compared with the exceptionally strong 
previous quarter, which had been boosted by 
large orders. The excellent shape of construc -
tion activity is also reflected in equipment util -
isation in the sector which, according to the ifo 
Institute, climbed to a new record high in 
March.
Labour market
The labour market is so far proving to be very 
robust in the face of the slowdown in eco -
nomic activity. Employment growth was less 
strong in February than in the previous month, 
but still considerable. After seasonal adjust -
ment, the total number of persons in work in 
February overall rose by 39,000 on the month. 
Employment was up by 482,000 persons, or 
1.1%, in comparison to the same month in the 
previous year. The increase is largely a result of 
the continued steep expansion in the number 
of employees subject to social security contri -
butions which, according to data as at January 
2019, was up by as much as 660,000 com -
pared to the same month of the previous year. 
By contrast, the number of self- employed per -
sons and persons working exclusively in low-  
paid part- time jobs continued to go down. The 
leading indicators of labour demand are still expansionary, although the ifo employment 
barometer relinquished its very high level in 
March. This was mainly attributable to the eco -
nomic downturn in the manufacturing sector. 
At the same time, the macroeconomic indica -
tors for labour market tightness remain very 
high.
Registered unemployment showed only a slight 
decline in March. The Federal Employment 
Agency reported 2.23 million unemployed per -
sons after seasonal adjustment, 7,000 fewer 
than in February. The unemployment rate fell 
by 0.1 percentage point to 4.9%. The number 
of unemployed persons was down by 157,000 
on the same month last year. Almost all of this 
decline is attributable to unemployed persons 
receiving the basic welfare allowance, who 
benefit from the low probability of being long- 
term unemployed. By contrast, the inflows and 
outflows amongst unemployed persons claim -
ing insurance benefits largely balanced each 
other out. The unemployment barometer of 
the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) 
continued to fall and is in neutral territory, 
which suggests unemployment will remain un -
changed overall in the next three months.
Prices
Crude oil prices continued to rise in March due 
to supply cutbacks made by the OPEC nations 
and production outages in Venezuela. They 
were 3½% higher than in February, matching 
the previous year’s level again. As this report 
went to press, the price of a barrel of Brent 
crude oil stood at US$71. The discount on 
crude oil futures was US$1¾ for deliveries six 
months ahead and US$3¼ for deliveries 12 
months ahead.
Import prices rose slightly in February. Energy 
prices, which are strongly geared to the crude 
oil price, were a driving force here, while they 
had a dampening effect on industrial producer 
prices in domestic sales due to energy pro -
duced in Germany playing an increasingly im -Construction

portant role. Industrial producer prices there -
fore declined somewhat overall but continued 
their slight upward trend when excluding en -
ergy. The year- on- year increase grew to 1½% in 
the case of import prices and held steady at 
just above 2½% in the case of producer prices.
In March, consumer prices (HICP) remained un -
changed in seasonally adjusted terms, after 
having risen slightly in the previous month. 
While energy and services including rents be -
came more expensive, food prices went down 
somewhat. Prices for industrial goods exclud -
ing energy declined perceptibly due to the fact 
that price inflation for clothing was weaker 
than it usually is in March. Annual headline 
HICP inflation decreased from +1.7% to +1.4% 
(CPI +1.3% from +1.5%), and the rate exclud -
ing energy and food was down from +1.6% to 
+1.0%. As this decline was partly due to the 
date of Easter falling later this year than last 
and to the development of the volatile com -
ponent of clothing, it is likely to be temporary.
Public finances
Local government finances
In 2018, local government core budgets and 
off- budget entities posted a surplus of just 
under €10 billion, down by €1 billion on the 
very high level from the previous year. Overall, 
revenue went up by 4½%. Dynamic growth in 
tax revenue amounted to 5½% and was in line 
with local business tax, which is a particularly 
large revenue item. Furthermore, shares in in -
come tax and in turnover tax – the latter being 
increased by a transfer from central govern -
ment – gave revenue a notable boost. Receipts 
from fees likewise shot up. By contrast, overall, 
transfers from state government grew at a 
slightly slower pace than total revenue. On the 
whole, state government refunded less for vari -
ous items of current expenditure, also as a re -
sult of declining benefits for asylum seekers.At 5%, expenditure grew somewhat faster 
than revenue, with the large expenditure items 
–  staff costs (+5%) and other operating ex -
penditure (+4½%) – making a notable contri -
bution. The rise in staff costs was driven by a 
distinct increase in negotiated wages and evi -
dently a further stepping up of staffing levels. 
Investment in fixed assets even climbed by 
13%. This is likely due to catch- up effects fol -
lowing a stagnation in construction investment 
last year. However, there was virtually no 
change in spending on social benefits. While 
payments of social assistance to persons who 
are unable to work continued to rise consider -
ably, this was offset by another sharp decline in 
benefits for asylum seekers and a fall in the ac -
commodation costs for recipients of unemploy -
ment benefit II. Interest expenditure plummeted 
again.
Surpluses are expected to continue falling this 
year and in the years thereafter. This is due to 
two factors. First, the expected cyclical slow -
down will rein in growth in tax revenue. How -
ever, this will be counterbalanced when the 
increased share of local business tax (€4 billion) 
no longer has to be transferred to state gov -
ernment as of next year. These payments from 
western German municipalities were intro -
duced to co- finance the costs of reunification. 
Second, expenditure growth is likely to remain 
dynamic, driven by measures to improve trans -
port infrastructure, schools and childcare. Such 
measures will only be co- financed in part by 
central and state government. Moreover, bur -
dens arising from social benefits are set to in -
crease again in the future.
In 2018, local government debt fell consider -
ably, by €7½ billion to just under €135 billion. 
This is mainly attributable to the fact that the 
“Hessenkasse” fund established by the federal 
state of Hesse has assumed almost all cash 
advances   accrued by the state’s municipalities 
(€5 billion). Cash advances are actually in -
tended to bridge liquidity shortfalls over the 
course of the year but have also been used for 
permanent financing. Overreliance on cash Consumer prices

advances  shows that many local governments 
have highly strained budgets. In addition to the 
impact of the “Hessenkasse” fund, outstanding 
cash advances fell by a further €1½ billion to 
just over €37 billion. Despite downward trends, 
local governments in Saarland, Rhineland-  
Palatinate and North Rhine-  Westphalia, how -
ever, still recorded high per capita levels of cash 
advances. Credit market debt (€94 billion) and 
public sector debt (€3½ billion) contracted only 
slightly. On balance, only around one-  quarter 
of the cash surplus has been used to repay 
debt. Many local governments therefore ap -
pear to have used the remaining amount to 
significantly top up reserves, making provisions 
for tougher times.
Securities markets
Bond market
At €127.3 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in February 2019 came in slightly 
below the January figure (€129.8 billion). After 
deducting redemptions, which were down on 
the previous month, and taking account of 
changes in issuers’ holdings of their own debt 
securities, the outstanding volume of domestic 
bonds grew by €13.7 billion. Foreign debt se -
curities worth €12.8 billion net were placed in 
the German market, causing the outstanding 
volume of debt securities in Germany to rise by 
€26.5 billion on balance.
In the month under review, credit institutions 
issued debt securities worth €16.8 billion net, 
compared with €8.4 billion one month earlier. 
On balance, these mostly took the form of 
debt securities issued by specialised credit insti -
tutions, the outstanding volume of which rose 
by €8.6 billion. Moreover, a net €5.2 billion 
worth of other bank debt securities and a net 
€2.9 billion worth of mortgage Pfandbriefe 
were also placed in the market.
Domestic enterprises augmented their capital 
market debt by €2.0 billion in February, up from €1.3 billion in the previous month. On 
balance, this exclusively involved bonds with a 
maturity of more than one year being issued, 
the majority of which emanated from non-  
financial corporations.
By contrast, the public sector reduced its hold -
ings of bond market liabilities by €5.2 billion 
net in the reporting month, down from a net 
issuance of €10.6 billion in January. While cen -
tral government primarily redeemed five- year 
Federal notes (Bobls) worth €11.7 billion net, it 
also redeemed Treasury discount paper (Bu -
bills), though to a lesser extent (€3.3 billion). 
This contrasted with net issuance of two- year 
Federal treasury notes (Schätze, €5.2 billion) 
and of ten- year and 30- year Federal bonds 
(Bunds, €3.1 billion and €2.2 billion respect -
ively). State and local governments issued se -
curities with a net value of €2.4 billion.

a net value of €12.4 billion to their portfolios. 
Domestic non- banks and German credit institu -
tions acquired bonds to the tune of €8.9 billion 
and €7.3 billion net respectively, their chief 
focus being on foreign securities in both in -
stances. The Bundesbank’s bond portfolio, on 
the other hand, shrank by a net €2.0 billion, 
owing to operational reasons.
Equity market
In the month under review, new shares worth 
€1.3 billion were issued in the German equity 
market. Over the same period, the outstanding 
volume of foreign shares in Germany increased 
by €1.2 billion. Domestic non- banks dominated 
the buyers’ side of the market in February, 
acquiring  shares worth €2.5 billion net. Con -
versely, non- resident investors and domestic 
credit institutions sold equities in the amount 
of €0.8 billion and €0.4 billion net respectively.Mutual funds
In February, the inflows recorded by domestic 
mutual funds exceeded those seen in January 
(€8.7 billion, compared with €7.7 billion). The 
bulk of these fresh funds benefited specialised 
funds reserved for institutional investors (€7.5 
billion). Among the various asset classes, mixed 
securities- based funds and bond- based funds 
were the key beneficiaries of inflows (€3.5 bil -
lion and €2.7 billion respectively), though open- 
end real estate funds and funds of funds also 
saw new funds injected (€0.9 billion each). The 
volume of foreign investment fund shares in 
the German market rose by €3.4 billion in Feb -
ruary. German non- banks were almost the sole 
net buyers of investment fund shares (€13.4 
billion). In net terms, domestic credit institu -
tions purchased shares for €0.7 billion, while 
foreign investors offloaded €2.0 billion worth 
of German shares.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €16.3 billion in February 2019, putting it 
€2.6 billion below the previous month’s level. 
Although the surplus in the goods account ex -
panded, the balance in invisible current trans -
actions, which comprises the services account 
as well as primary and secondary income, nar -
rowed to a much greater degree.
In the reporting month, the surplus in the 
goods account increased by €3.2 billion on the 
month to €19.1 billion. While exports of goods 
contracted, not least as a result of lower net 
exports under merchanting, the decline in im -
ports of goods was nonetheless more substan -
tial.
Germany recorded a deficit of €2.8 billion in 
invisible current transactions in February, com -
pared with a surplus of €3.0 billion in January. 
This turnaround arose from declining balances 
in the primary and secondary income. Net re -

€2.9 billion to €6.2 billion, largely on the back 
of higher dividend payments on portfolio in -
vestments by non- residents. The deficit in the 
secondary income account widened by €2.9 
billion to stand at €7.9 billion. The result in the 
primary income account was primarily gener -
ated by higher payments to the EU budget 
stemming from financing related to gross na -
tional income. By contrast, the deficit in the 
services account remained virtually unchanged 
at €1.1 billion, with both sides of the balance 
sheet becoming shortened in almost equal 
measure. Looking at the comparatively small 
shifts recorded in individual items, decreases 
dominated on both the revenue and the ex -
penditure side, notably in the area of other 
business related services and transport.
In February 2019, the international financial 
markets were influenced, on the one hand, by 
a reduced sense of uncertainty – not least with 
respect to the trade dispute between the 
United States and China – and, on the other 
hand, by heightened expectations of a con -
tinued accommodative monetary policy stance 
in the euro area. Against this backdrop, Ger -
many’s cross- border portfolio investment gen -
erated net capital exports in the amount of 
€7.6 billion, compared with net capital imports 
of €1.1 billion in January. This resulted mainly 
from the fact that domestic investors acquired 
foreign securities to the tune of €16.6 billion 
net, with a special appetite for investment fund 
shares (€3.4 billion) and bonds (€12.5 billion), 
particularly those denominated in euro. On a 
lesser scale, they also purchased foreign shares 
(€0.4 billion) and money market paper (€0.3 
billion). Meanwhile, foreign investors invested 
a net €9.0 billion in German securities, focus -
sing on – for the most part, private – bonds 
(€17.0 billion). Conversely, they parted with 
money market paper (€4.6 billion), investment 
fund shares (€2.0 billion) and shares (€1.4 bil -
lion).

channelled funds to their foreign affiliates to -

means of intra- group lending (€7.6 billion), par -
ticularly via short- term loans, and, on the other, 
by bolstering their equity capital abroad by 
€5.2 billion, of which €2.9 billion took the form 
of reinvested earnings. Alongside this, foreign 
enterprises stepped up their direct investment 
in Germany by €7.5 billion, with intra- group 
lending accounting for more than half of the 
total amount (€4.6 billion). This stemmed 
chiefly from financial credits granted by foreign 
subsidiaries to their German parent companies 
(reverse flows), which came to €7.6 billion. On 
top of this, foreign enterprises boosted their 
equity capital in Germany by €2.9 billion.

Household wealth and finances 
in  Germany: results of the 2017 survey
Every three years, the Bundesbank conducts a survey of German households’ wealth and debt 
entitled the “Panel on Household Finances (PHF)”. The collected data feed into studies of monet -
ary and financial stability policy and form the basis of research projects and analyses both within 
and outside of the Bundesbank. Almost 5,000 households participated in the 2017 survey. Around 
two- thirds of these households were taking part for the second or third time.
The results for 2017 show that household wealth increased on a broad front between 2014 and 
2017. Both average net wealth and the median value increased significantly. The net wealth of 
real estate owners, in particular, has risen owing to higher real estate prices. However, the wealth 
of many tenant households and households in the poorer half of the distribution has also grown. 
Higher incomes, in particular, are contributing to the positive wealth developments of these 
households by putting them in a position to save more money and reducing their need to take 
out new consumer loans.
Although some metrics of the inequality of wealth distribution declined slightly compared with 
the previous survey, overall, no clear trend is evident in relation to earlier surveys.
The share of indebted households and the percentage of households with negative net wealth 
changed only marginally between 2010 and 2017. The pressure on households from interest on 
loans decreased during the same period. A much smaller share of indebted households’ income 
was consumed by interest payments on loans in 2017 than in 2010.
This article describes the composition and distribution of household wealth and debt in Germany. 
Other factors such as public finances, public pension provision, and access to education or the 
healthcare system, to name just a few, also play a role when it comes to forming a more com -
prehensive assessment of the financial situation or indeed the welfare of households.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
This article presents selected results of the 2017 
survey on household wealth and finances in 
Germany in 2017. As the Bundesbank had al -
ready conducted surveys on the wealth, debt 
and income of households in Germany as well 
as their saving and investment behaviour back 
in 2010 and 2014, a comparison can also be 
drawn across the years.
The present article limits itself to describing the 
distribution and composition of households’ 
wealth. As a general rule, these statistics alone 
do not allow any conclusions to be drawn 
about possible causal relationships. Further an -
alysis is required for this. The study “Panel on 
Household Finances (PHF)” was therefore de -
signed from the outset with a view to academic 
research both within and outside of the Bun -
desbank. The anonymised microdatasets may 
be requested from the Bundesbank’s Research 
Data and Service Centre for academic research 
projects. They are currently being used by over 
200 researchers in more than 140 projects.
Wealth distribution 
in  Germany in 2017
Wealth distribution can be characterised using 
various statistical parameters. These include, 
for example, the relationships between the 
mean and median, Gini coefficients and 
wealthy households’ share of total net wealth.
In order to calculate the ratio between mean 
and median wealth, average (mean) wealth 
must first be determined. In 2017, according to 
the PHF study, households in Germany pos -
sessed average gross wealth of €262,5001 and 
average net wealth of €232,800 following de -
duction of debt.
If households are grouped in ascending order 
according to their net wealth, the median can 
be determined, amongst other things. This 
value divides households into a wealthier half and a poorer half.2 At €86,400 for gross wealth 
and €70,800 for net wealth, the median values 
were significantly lower than the average val -
ues in 2017.
Examining the relationship between the me -
dian and mean values, it emerges that average 
net wealth is more than three times as high as 
median net wealth. This high value is already 
an indication that net wealth is unevenly dis -
tributed in Germany.3
The cut- off point at which a household can be 
counted among the wealthiest 10% in Ger -
many can also be determined by ranking 
households according to net wealth. This limit, 
known as the 90th percentile, stood at 
€621,000 for gross wealth and €555,400 for 
net wealth.
Another measure of inequality in a distribution 
is the ratio of the 90th percentile to the me -
dian. The higher the value, the more steeply 
the net wealth of households in the middle of 
the distribution would have to rise in order for 
them to rank among the wealthiest 10% of 
households. In terms of net wealth, the cut- off 
between the wealthiest 10% and all other 
households is roughly eight times higher than 
the median. By way of comparison, this ratio 
for the euro area as a whole was five in 2014, 
the last year for which data are available.
Similarly, the Gini coefficient4 for net wealth – a 
classic measure of inequality – also indicates a

1 These and all other values in this article are expressed in 
nominal terms unless stated otherwise; i.e. they have not 
been adjusted for inflation.
2 Based on the sequence of the households sorted accord -
ing to wealth, further parameters can be deduced (known 
as quantiles). A breakdown into ten equal parts yields the 
deciles.
3 Mean net wealth is strongly influenced by extreme val -
ues. A high ratio between the median and the mean there -
fore suggests that wealth in the upper part of the distribu -
tion is considerably greater than in the middle.
4 The Gini coefficient generally assumes values between 
0% and 100%, with 0% representing a perfectly even dis -
tribution and 100% signifying maximum inequality. The 
closer the figure is to 100%, the more uneven the distribu -
tion. If negative values are also included in the calculation, 
the Gini coefficient can also assume a value of over 100%.Deutsche Bundesbank

The defi  nition of wealth in the “Panel on household 
fi  nances” (PHF)
The PHF study aims to compile and present 
detailed information on households’ 
wealth1 in Germany. The PHF’s defi  nition of 
wealth is therefore designed to capture 
both the assets and liabilities on house-
holds’ balance sheets. The assets side (gross 
wealth) consists of non- fi  nancial assets and 
fi  nancial assets. On the liabilities side, assets 
are contrasted with liabilities, i.e. loans se-
cured by real estate and unsecured loans. 
Net wealth is calculated as the difference 
between gross wealth and debt.
The depth of information on the types of 
wealth captured in the PHF goes beyond 
other surveys on the subject of wealth. 
Under non- fi  nancial assets, for example, 
the value of vehicles, collections and jewel-
lery is recorded alongside property and 
business ownership. There is also compre-
hensive coverage of fi  nancial assets. These 
consist of balances with banks, such as sav-
ings banks and building and loan associ-
ations, securities, long- term equity invest-
ment and assets under management. The 
positive balances from private pension and 
life insurance policies are also included.2 
Not included are any statutory pension 
claims that lie in the distant future. As a pay- as- you-go system exists in Germany, a 
variety of assumptions would fi  rst be 
needed to recalculate (capitalise) future 
pension entitlements as assets. Moreover, 
these are only claims and not savings.
The households evaluate their assets them-
selves. This is mainly relevant for property 
and business ownership. In both cases, 
households are asked what price could be 
achieved for their property or business if it 
were to be sold.
Assets held abroad are also included in the 
calculation of a household’s total assets, if 
the respondents report them.

Total assets Total assets1 The PHF defi  nes households as groups of persons 
whose centre of life is at a shared address and who 
share daily expenses. Persons who temporarily do not 
live at that address but regularly return there are also 
considered part of the household. Persons or groups 
of persons who live in a shared residence without hav-
ing a family or partnership relationship, or domestic 
staff residing at that address, constitute households in 
their own right. People in collective households (e.g. 
retirement homes or refugee homes) and institutions 
(e.g. monasteries) do not constitute households.
2 Households’ wealth includes private pension and life 
insurance policies in the accumulation phase or where 
contributions have been suspended. They are removed 
from the households’ balance sheets once payouts 
from the policies are commenced; the relevant fl  ows 
of income are then taken into account when calculat-
ing income.Deutsche Bundesbank

persistently uneven distribution of wealth, 
standing at 74% in 2017.5
Over the past few years, the academic litera -
ture describing income and wealth distribution 
has increasingly looked at (very) wealthy house -
holds’ share of total wealth.6 On this basis, just 
how uneven the distribution is can also be de -
duced from the share of wealth held by the top 
10% in the net wealth distribution. In 2017, this 
group possessed around 55% of total net 
wealth in Germany.7 Values for a comparable 
period are currently only available for the 
United States, Italy and Austria. In 2016, 
roughly 44% and 77% of total net wealth be -
longed to this group in Italy and the United 
States respectively, whereas the figure for Aus -
tria stood at 56% in 2017. It amounted to 51% 
for the euro area as a whole in 2014.8
Alongside the overall measures of the distribu -
tion of net wealth, the distribution of wealth 
amongst individual groups of households, such 
as those who own real estate, is also of inter -
est.9
Real estate ownership is a good indicator for a 
household’s level of wealth. Households living 
in a property they own have considerably 
higher net wealth than tenant households.10 
The median net wealth of owner households 
amounted to €277,000 in 2017. For tenant 
households, conversely, the median value is 
only around €10,400. Similar structures can be 
found in other countries both throughout Eur -
ope and worldwide. The highlighted differ -
ences are not only the result of whether a 
household owns real estate or not, but are also 
at least partly due to the differing household 
structures of owners and tenants, for example 
with regard to age, household size, marital sta -
tus of household members, and income.11 In 
addition, rising real estate prices in the last few 
years have had a significant impact on the 
development  of property- owning households’ 
wealth.The well- documented differences between 
eastern and western Germany with regard to 
income and other economic indicators12 are 
also apparent when examining wealth. The 
median household in eastern Germany had 
wealth of €23,400 in 2017; the median house -
hold in western Germany, by contrast, had 
approximately  four times as much wealth, at 
€92,500. The lower proportion of home 
owners in the eastern states presumably plays a 
role here. The distribution of wealth as meas -
ured by the Gini coefficient is still somewhat 
more uneven in the eastern states (77%) than 
in the western states (72%).
Differences can also be identified in terms of 
socio- demographic characteristics. The PHF 
study captures a household’s wealth as a whole 
rather than recording that of the individual 
members of that household. The size and com -
position of a household are therefore signifi -
cant when determining the average and me -
dian wealth of certain household groups. At 
€141,800, the average net wealth of single 
person households in 2017 amounted to 
slightly less than half of that of couple house -Wealthiest 10%

5 The latest available Gini coefficient for the euro area 
dates back to the year 2014, when it amounted to 68.5%. 
2014 figures for individual euro area countries can be 
found in Household Finance and Consumption Network 
(2016a).
6 See Piketty (2014); and Saez and Zucman (2016).
7 The share of wealth attributable to the top 10% of the 
distribution is probably underestimated (see Vermeulen 
(2018)). The approach behind the study “Panel on house -
hold finances (PHF)” is to over- represent the wealthy 
households in the (unweighted) sample (see the box on 
p. 17). This goal has generally been achieved. However, as 
in all other comparable surveys, very wealthy households 
are missing from the PHF. None of the households sur -
veyed in the PHF have assets amounting to €100 million or 
more. This under- recording is not offset through the 
weighting of the data.

Federal Reserve Bank (2017); for Austria, Oesterreichische 
Nationalbank (2019); for the euro area, Household Finance

9 Only a few methods of breaking down households into 
different groups can be outlined here. Further breakdowns 
can be found in the tables on pp. 30 ff.
10 In Germany, only 44% of households own their main 
residence. Of all the other euro area countries, only Austria 
has a similarly low share (46% in 2017). By way of compari -
son, home ownership levels in Italy and Spain stood at 
around 70% and 80% respectively in 2014.

PHF study 2017: 
methodological design of the third survey
Between March and October 2017, 4,942 
households comprising 9,710 persons aged 
16 and over participated in the PHF study in 
Germany. Some of the households (3,335) 
took part in a PHF survey for the second or 
third time. For the remaining 1,607 house-
holds, it was their ﬁ  rst survey. There was a 
response rate of 33% for successfully con-
tacted households. The response rate was 
around 70% for households that had al-
ready participated in the survey (panel 
households) and only 16% for those ap-
proached for the ﬁ  rst time. The response 
rate for the panel households is comparable 
to other surveys conducted in Germany, but 
the ﬁ  gure for households included in the 
study for the ﬁ  rst time is relatively low, 
which to some extent is likely due to the 
general decline in willingness to participate 
in surveys.
The methodology used in the third PHF sur-
vey in 2017 is largely based on that of the 
previous surveys in 2010/ 2011 and 2014. As 
before, computer- assisted personal inter-
views (CAPI) were carried out face- to- face 
at the interviewee’s home. The just under 
300 trained interviewers required a little 
over an hour on average to complete an 
interview.
In 2017, the target population again also 
included  households with at least one per-
son over 18, but did not include people liv-
ing in collective households (e.g. retirement 
homes, student halls of residence and refu-
gee homes) or institutions (e.g. monasteries 
or prisons).
Addresses of households approached for 
the ﬁ  rst time were selected randomly from 
lists provided by residence registration of-ﬁ  ces. An oversampling feature was imple-
mented at this point, which means that 
wealthy households are overrepresented in 
the sample chosen.1 The higher selection 
probability was taken into account in the 
weighting, so that the results shown can be 
regarded as being representative for house-
holds in Germany.
In order to ensure comparability across the 
individual surveys, only minor modiﬁ  cations 
were made to the PHF questionnaire for the 
third wave. The questionnaire was ex-
panded in some areas to include questions 
on households’ expectations regarding 
house prices, for example.
Further information on the methodology 
and background of the PHF survey can be 
found at https:// www.bundesbank.de/ en/ 
bundesbank/ research/ panel- on- household- 
finances.
1 Income tax statistics are used in sampling to divide 
smaller municipalities with less than 100,000 residents 
into “rich municipalities” and “other municipalities”. In 
cities with 100,000 residents and more, wealthy street 
sections are identiﬁ  ed using micro- geographic infor-
mation on residential area and purchasing power. Fi-
nally, the proportion of households in the sample is 
selected such that households in wealthy municipal-
ities and wealthy street sections are oversampled com-
pared with their numbers in the population.Deutsche Bundesbank

holds (€319,000). By contrast, the median 
value for couple households is almost seven 
times higher than that of people living alone. 
As has also become evident in recent years, 
single- parent households, in particular, have lit -
tle wealth. In 2017, half of these households 
possessed less than €5,200 gross or €3,900 net 
wealth.
Households can also be grouped by personal 
characteristics, represented by a reference per -
son.13 One such characteristic might be the age 
of the reference person. Households in which 
the reference person is between 16 and 24 
years of age have the lowest net wealth (see 
the above chart). Median net wealth rises with 
the age of the reference person until the age 
group 55-64, and only starts to decline in the 
over-65s age group, as this is when households 
begin to dissave and monetary gifts become 
more prevalent. By contrast, households’ me -
dian net income already starts decreasing in 
the age group 55-64.14 Viewed in isolation, however, age is of limited usefulness when it 
comes to explaining wealth structures. The 
composition of the household and the employ -
ment status of its members are only two of 
many factors that change with age and which 
may thus have a bearing on the volume and 
composition of asset holdings measured in the 
survey.

201415
The mean and the median values for house -
holds’ net wealth increased between 2014 and 
2017, as had been the case between 2010 and 
2014 (see the chart on p. 21). Overall, between 
2014 and 2017, average net wealth grew by 
€18,300 (+9%), while the median rose by 
€10,400 (+17%).16 Few households who own 
real estate or stocks are found in the middle 
and the bottom part of the wealth distribution. 
Increased household income, which allows 
households to save more money and at the 
same time reduces their need to take out new 
consumer loans, is therefore more significant 
for developments in the median. On the other

highest income in the household. If two or more members 
of a household have an equally high income, one person is 
selected at random.
14 Possible reasons for this include (early) retirement and a 
general decline in labour market participation.
15 Although the survey was conducted for the third time, 
it is unable to accurately depict certain events, such as the 
increased influx of refugees, from one survey to the next. 
Consequently, the impact of migration on the survey results 
cannot be examined on the basis of data from the PHF 
study. The number of migrants in the sample is too low for 
this.
16 Unless stated otherwise, the analysis is performed on 
the basis of nominal values over time. Calculating inflation- 
adjusted wealth measures is not without its problems as 
there is no generally accepted price index for wealth. As a 
rule, therefore, consumer price inflation has been used, or 
inflation- adjusted values have not been given at all. Since 
the cumulative inflation rate as measured by the consumer 
price index stood at only around 2.7% between 2014 and 
2017, adjustment for inflation barely impacts on the 2014/ 
2017 comparison and does not alter the trend statements. 
Between 2010 and 2014, consumer prices rose by 6.7% in 
cumulative terms. Adjusted for inflation, i.e. at 2010 prices, 
growth compared with 2014 stood at €10,800 for the 
mean and €7,700 for the median value.Deutsche Bundesbank

Selected research results based on PHF data
The study “Panel on household fi  nances” 
(PHF) not only provides important results for 
advising policy makers, it is also used for aca-
demic research on the behaviour and fi  nancial 
situation of German households. More than 
200 researchers in Germany and abroad are 
now using the anonymised data for research 
projects. The empirical and theoretical pro-
jects cover a large range of subjects.
In recent years, central banks around the 
world have dropped their policy rates to his-
torical lows and pursued non- standard policy 
measures such as extensive programmes to 
purchase government bonds. Drawing on 
micro data from the PHF and similar house-
hold surveys by other central banks, a number 
of current research projects are addressing the 
question regarding the extent to which mon-
etary policy inﬂ  uences the distribution of 
households’ wealth and income in Germany 
and other European countries.1
Tzamourani (2019) analyses the unhedged 
interest rate exposure2 of households in the 
euro area. This indicator captures the extent 
to which households respond to changes in 
real interest rates and reﬂ  ects the direct gains 
and losses in their net interest income after 
such changes. On the whole, households in 
individual countries are exposed to very differ-
ent types of interest rate risk. These national 
differences are mainly caused by the hetero-
geneous distribution of adjustable- rate mort-
gages. In countries where the prevalence of 
adjustable- rate mortgages issued is high, 
households’ interest rate exposure is negative 
on average, i.e. where inﬂ  ation is constant, 
households would be impacted negatively on 
average by an interest rate hike. In Germany 
and other countries where the number of 
people with adjustable- rate mortgages is low, 
households would initially benefi  t on average 
from a hike in interest rates (where inﬂ  ation 
remains constant).
Given the importance of housing wealth to 
the distribution of wealth within individual countries and across euro area countries, the 
differences in the investment behaviour of 
owner households and tenant households 
have been the focus of a number of ongoing 
research projects. Le Blanc and Schmidt 
(2019a) investigate differences in owners’ and 
tenants’ savings behaviour, noting that house-
holds do not cut back on their active savings 
ﬂ  ows despite passive saving in the form of 
mortgage repayments, but rather save on top 
of their pre- existing contracts.
While this article focuses on the distribution 
of wealth, the fi  nancial situation of house-
holds is multidimensional and characterised 
by the joint distribution of consumption, in-
come and wealth.3 In an ongoing research 
project, Le Blanc and Schmidt (2019b) esti-
mate the joint distribution of consumption, 
income and wealth in Germany. One provi-
sional result of this project is that consump-
tion and income are more evenly distributed 
than net wealth.
Inherited assets also play a major role in 
wealth distribution and inequality. Pasteau 
and Zhu (2018) analyse inherited wealth as an 
additional potential factor in explaining the 
choice of partner. One of the main fi  ndings of 
their analysis is that prospects of an inherit-
ance are more than twice as important than 
income in explaining marriage choice. As the 
number of inheritances is expected to rise in 
the coming years, this will also have implica-
tions on the dynamics of wealth inequality.
In addition to the detailed information on the 
components of wealth, the PHF also provides 
information on households’ expectations, 
which are crucial to consumption and invest-
ment behaviour.

hand, increases in real estate and share prices 
are likely to have played a key role in the rise in 
net wealth in the upper range of the distribu -
tion, where real estate and share ownership 
are widespread.
The values breaking down net wealth distribu -
tion17 into ten equal parts increased across the 
board. While the cut- offs for the bottom four 
deciles were lower in 2014 than in 2010, they 
rebounded to 2010 levels in 2017.18 In absolute 
terms, however, these increases are small and 
amounted to between €100 and €4,200 in 
these deciles. Measured in euro terms, upward 
shifts in the top part of the wealth distribution 
are greater, as expected. In order to rank 
among the wealthiest 10% of households in 
Germany, around €442,000 was needed in 
2010, roughly €468,000 in 2014 and just over 
€555,400 in 2017.19 However, even relative to 
the figure determined in the preceding study, 
the percentage increases in the upper half of the distribution were more pronounced than in 
the lower half of the distribution.
The major significance of real estate in terms of 
household wealth and its distribution was al -
ready apparent in the first two waves of the 
PHF study.20 It is therefore hardly surprising that 
wealth has risen especially sharply, in both ab -
solute terms and relative to the values for 2014, 
for those deciles of the net wealth distribution 
in which property- owning households are es -
pecially common, i.e. the wealthiest 40% of 
households.21Broad- based 
increase in net 
wealthGoldfayn- Frank and Wohlfart (2018) analyse 
the inﬂ  ation expectations of households in 
eastern and western Germany. They docu-
ment the fact that the inﬂ  ation expectations 
of households that were located in East Ger-
many before German reunifi  cation are one 
percentage point higher than the inﬂ  ation ex-
pectations of western German households. 
The authors cite the surprisingly high inﬂ  ation 
that eastern German households experienced 
after 1989 as a reason for their signifi  cantly 
higher inﬂ  ation expectations. The differing in-
ﬂ  ation expectations are still seen today in the 
investment behaviour of people born in east-
ern Germany.
In an ongoing research project, Kindermann 
et al. (2019) studied the expectations of 
households regarding the development of 
house prices over the following twelve 
months. Two clear patterns can be identifi  ed 
when it comes to households that provide in-
formation on how house prices will evolve in 
their area in the following twelve months. First, households tend to underestimate future 
house price developments.4 Second, a differ-
ence emerges between tenant households 
and owner households. Tenants expect higher 
inﬂ  ation than owner households, especially 
those that intend to purchase property.

4 These results cannot be generalised, however, as the 
underlying data only recognise the upturn in house 
prices.
17 The discussion in this article focuses on net wealth dis -
tribution. Corresponding analyses of gross wealth distribu -
tion can be carried out using the tables in the annex on 
pp. 30 ff.
18 These figures provide only limited information on 
changes in individual households’ net wealth, as house -
holds’ position in the distribution may change.
19 At 2010 prices, the values are €436,600 for 2014 and 
€503,500 for 2017.

As a result of these developments, indicators 
focusing on the range between certain parts of 
the wealth distribution have risen since 2010.
For example, the difference between the top 
and bottom quartiles of the net wealth distri -
bution (“interquartile range”) increased from 
around €203,000 to €262,000. This corres -
ponds to growth of almost 30% between 2010 
and 2017.22
Looking at the gaps between the deciles of the 
distribution and the median as the midpoint of 
the distribution, it is striking that both the top 
and bottom deciles have moved further away 
from the median. The gap between the median 
and the first decile is now around €19,400 
greater than it was in 2010. The gap between 
the ninth decile and the median rose by around 
€93,600 compared with 2010. The part of the 
distribution with a high proportion of property 
owners (see the chart on p. 23), in particular, 
became further removed from the median in 
relative terms between 2010 and 2017. This de -
velopment also reflects the fact that the per -
centage of households in Germany who are 
homeowners is below 50%. In other words, 
the median household does not own its own 
home and is therefore not benefiting from the 
rise in real estate prices.
The widening gaps between individual parts of 
the net wealth distribution tend to point to -
wards an increase in inequality. By contrast, 
other indicators measuring inequality in the dis -
tribution of household net wealth, which are 
listed in the table on page 23, fell slightly over 
time or remained unchanged.
The Gini coefficient and the share of total net 
wealth held by the wealthiest 10% of house -
holds decreased by 2 and 5 percentage points 
respectively. The ratio of the mean to the me -
dian and the gap between the wealthiest 10% 
of households and the median changed only 
slightly. As before, the lower half of the distri -
bution of wealth accounts for around 3% of 
total net wealth (see the chart on p. 25). The share of total wealth held by the top 10% of 
households fell from about 60% in 2014 to 
55% in 2017. In return, the share held by the 
group between the 90th percentile and the 
median rose from 38% to 42% over the same 
period.
Similar, smaller changes in these indicators 
were revealed in the past in other wealth sur -
veys for Germany and other countries without 
resulting in a revised assessment of inequality.23
The declines in the Gini coefficient and the 
share of total net wealth held by the top 10% 
of households should not be overstated, in part 
due to the known issues related to recording 
wealth in the top tail.24 In the 2017 survey Increase in

22 The interquartile range is a measure of statistical disper -
sion. When interpreting the data, it is important to note 
that the interquartile range would increase even if the 
wealth of all households rose by the same factor. At 2010 
prices, the interquartile range was around €237,200 in 
2017 (+17% compared with 2010).
23 In Italy, the Gini coefficient for net wealth has hovered 
between 60% and 64% since the mid-1990s (Banca d’Italia 
(2018)), whilst in Austria it has fluctuated between 76% 
and 73% since 2010 (Oesterreichische Nationalbank 
(2019)). For Germany, too, data from the Socio- Economic 
Panel (SOEP) and the sample survey of income and expend -
iture (EVS) show that the Gini coefficient has, in the past, 
tended to fluctuate slightly by between 1 and 2 percentage 
points (see Deutsche Bundesbank (2016a), pp. 18-20 and 
the chart on p. 17; and Grabka and Westermeier (2014)).

wave, it appears, in particular, that business 
assets in the top tail of the distribution were 
under- recorded. In addition, fewer very wealthy 
households participated in the survey com -
pared with the survey waves in 2010 and 2014. 
Both of these factors may be the reason behind 
the slight decrease in some of the distribution 
measures.
Overall, it is not possible to discern any clear 
trend from the figures in relation to the evolu -
tion of inequality in terms of net wealth distri -
bution. Household net wealth in Germany re -
mains unequally distributed.
The structure of household 
wealth in 2017 compared 
with 2014 and 2010
From a macroeconomic perspective, the past 
few years in Germany were characterised by 
high employment, rising share prices, low de -posit and lending rates and, in many regions, 
rising real estate prices. These developments 
have also had an impact on households’ wealth 
and investment behaviour, as already indicated 
by the structures mentioned above. Taking a 
closer look at individual assets and parts of the 
wealth distribution provides further evidence.
For example, the rise in real estate prices is re -
flected in higher real estate wealth for house -
holds who own their main residence, as meas -
ured by both the mean value (+€27,400) and 
the median (+€37,200).25
Rising house prices may also have an indirect 
impact on the size of mortgage loans – for ex -

25 In the survey, the current hypothetical (resale) value of a 
property is estimated by the households themselves. In 
addition to the current value according to the self-  
assessment, households also state the price they originally  
paid, often quite a long time ago. The difference between 
the two prices is subjected to plausibility checks.Deutsche Bundesbank

debt in order to be able to afford a property, or 
if properties are more heavily leveraged in view 
of low lending rates. Median mortgage debt 
was €81,000 in 2017, compared with €76,400 
in 2014. Not only has median mortgage debt 
increased, the mean value of outstanding mort -
gage debt for households with mortgage debt 
also rose by around €14,000.26 However, this 
debt is backed by real estate assets that have 
appreciated even more. The, relatively speak -
ing, largest increases in mortgage debt were 
recorded by the wealthiest 10% of households 
in terms of net wealth.27 The unconditional 
mean value for mortgage debt rose by around 
€28,700 in this part of the distribution. These 
households usually have sufficient financial re -
sources to meet the capital requirements for a 
mortgage loan. As described in the section 
below entitled “Households’ debt situation”, 
debt service as a share of income has declined 
for indebted households as a whole.
Changes in holdings of shares and funds reflect 
the rise in share prices between 2014 and 2017. 
On average, the value of shares for those 
households with direct shareholdings rose by 
around €5,000, or 13%; by contrast, the me -
dian remained virtually unchanged at just under 
€10,000. The German stock market index in -
creased by almost 30% between mid-  April 
2014 and mid-  April 2017. As a result, the in -
crease measured in the PHF study is lower. 
However, the data do not allow for a separate 
analysis of the changes in the value of possible 
acquisitions and sales. Furthermore, changes in 
the composition of the shareholders cannot be 
taken into account. If, for example, households 
with large share portfolios sell part of them and 
other households invest smaller amounts in the 
equity market, this can affect the mean value 
as well as the median, despite the fact that the 
percentage of households with shareholdings 
does not change. This could also be a reason 
for the lower values for fund holdings.
In terms of financial assets, the increase in 
assets on current accounts is striking. Com -
pared with 2014, the average current account balance increased by 65%, with the median ris -
ing to a similar extent. This development sug -
gests that households in Germany continue to 
have a preference for liquid forms of invest -
ment that are perceived as low- risk.… and house -

26 When interpreting these figures, it should be borne in 
mind that reference is made to the current outstanding 
loan amount, and that loans taken out some time ago and 
new loans are therefore analysed together.
27 For this group of very wealthy households, the share of 
households who own property in addition to their main 
residence rose by 5 percentage points. Part of the growth 
in mortgage lending is therefore probably attributable to 
new builds or purchases of additional properties.Deutsche Bundesbank

Self-assessment of position in the distribution of wealth
In the PHF study for 2017, households were 
surveyed for the fi  rst time on where they 
would assign themselves within the distri-
bution of wealth. In theory, each decile 
covers 10% of the households. However, at 
the upper end of the distribution, the re-
sponses reveal a clear trend towards house-
holds underestimating their own wealth 
position (see the chart below). Less than 
3% of the households surveyed put them-
selves in one of the top two deciles, while 
around 20% of households saw themselves 
as belonging to each of the three centre 
deciles.1 At the lower end of the distribu-
tion, just over 10% assigned themselves to 
the corresponding deciles.
A comparison of the self- assessments with 
the actual position in the distribution re-
veals that as net wealth as measured in the 
survey rises, not only does the number of 
households that assign themselves to the 
wrong decile increase, the average devi-
ation of the estimated decile from the ac-
tual decile widens as well. On the other 
hand, it is also true that households’ aver-age wealth is higher the further up they 
classify themselves in the distribution.
To be able to make a proper classifi  cation, a 
household would have to be aware of the 
actual distribution of wealth and be able to 
make a correct assessment of the entirety 
of its net wealth. As net wealth increases, 
the degree of complexity in the wealth 
structures generally rises with it and it be-
comes more diffi   cult for a household to 
make an ad hoc estimation of its total 
wealth.2 In addition, it may be assumed 
that only very few households are aware of 
the actual distribution of wealth. Neverthe-
less, given that fact, it is surprising that it is 
primarily the households at the lower end 
of the distribution, where it is still quite fl  at, 
that were able to give a more precise esti-
mation of their wealth position.
Further analysis is required to determine 
whether the self- assessment (compared 
with the actual position in the distribution 
of wealth) has an impact on households’ 
consumption and savings behaviour.
1 A similar structure can also be seen in Austria in 
2014 and 2016. For more information on this, see 
Oesterreichische Nationalbank (2019).

types of wealth and debt are gathered in the PHF 
study and used to calculate the household’s net 
wealth.Self-assessment of households regarding

As before, almost every household in Germany 
has a current account. By contrast, there was a 
slight decline in the percentage of households 
who own longer- term financial assets, such as 
private retirement provision products28 from 
which no payments are yet being received, 
whole life insurance policies or savings ac -
counts.
Overall, the average level of financial assets re -
ported in the PHF study rose only slightly be -
tween 2014 and 2017 (+5%) – that is to say, 
the sum of the balances on current and savings 
accounts, the value of funds and shares, pri -
vate retirement provision products (including 
whole life insurance policies) and other finan -
cial assets. The financial accounts29 show a far 
higher increase in gross financial assets be -
tween 2014 and 2017 (+€313.2 billion, or 
+15.6%). However, the concepts and defin -
itions of assets used in the PHF study and the 
financial accounts are not identical. It is also 
known from previous studies that financial 
assets tend to be under- recorded in surveys.30
Comparing the results of the PHF study and the 
financial accounts nevertheless appears useful. 
The value of sight deposits rose in both balance 
sheets between 2014 and 2017, whereas the 
value of savings deposits fell. The rise in share -
holdings and the value of funds can likewise be 
observed in both the PHF study and the finan -
cial accounts. Overall, the increases and de -
creases in these wealth components are smaller 
in the PHF study than in the financial ac -
counts.31
Businesses in which the household plays an ac -
tive role are counted as real assets in the PHF 
study and are valued at the hypothetical resale 
value estimated by the household.32 The PHF 
study from 2017 shows that the percentage of 
households with business ownership has not 
changed. The mean value for business assets 
decreased, while the median increased. This 
structure points to a problem related to record -
ing households with very large business 
assets.33 Just like shareholdings, business assets are held largely by wealthy households in the 
upper part of the distribution and are one of 
the most unequally distributed asset types.34 
Individual extremely high values can therefore 
have a major impact on measured averages 
and inequality, not only for this asset type but 
also for net wealth as a whole.

31 An increase in cash holdings of around €63 billion also 
contributed to growth in the financial accounts. This item 
is not taken into account in the wealth concept used in the 
PHF study. In addition, insurance claims rose significantly in 
the macroeconomic accounting systems; these are not 
captured in the PHF study to the same extent or using the 
same definitions as in the financial accounts and are there -
fore not comparable.
32 The exact wording of the question: “How much is the 
business or the company worth after the deduction of li -
abilities? Here I mean: for what amount could you sell your 
stake if you take into account the company’s assets and 
deduct the liabilities?” The question has remained the same 
in all waves of the PHF survey.
33 However, due to problems of definition and differing 
valuations, it is not easy to find comparable figures (see 
Chakraborty and Waltl (2018)).

discussed above. The outstanding amount of 
unsecured loans also rose in 2017, with the me -
dian now standing at €4,900, compared with 
€3,500 in 2014 and €3,200 in 2010. The per -
centage of households with unsecured loans 
remained stable between 2014 and 2017 at 
33%, however. On a related note, the share of 
households with negative net wealth, i.e. 
households whose debt exceeds their assets, 
fell slightly from 8.7% in 2014 to 7.5% in 
2017.35
The structure of portfolios along the net wealth 
distribution barely changed between 2010 and 
2017. Whilst, in the upper range of the distribu -
tion, real assets and real estate make up the 
bulk of wealth, in the lower half of the distribu -
tion households’ wealth consists almost exclu -
sively of financial assets (see the chart on 
p. 27). Levels of outstanding debt increase as 
net wealth rises.Saving and wealth
Upward and downward movements in particu -
lar asset prices are not the only factors that 
may alter the structure of asset holdings de -
scribed above; it is also shaped, in part, by 
households’ saving and investment behaviour. 
While changes in saving and investment pat -
terns generally only start having an impact on 
wealth composition over the long run, they are 
nevertheless relevant when it comes to the ef -
fect of monetary policy measures.
Looking at 2016, analyses on the basis of a 
special survey conducted as part of the PHF 
study show that households modify their sav -
ings behaviour in response to low interest rates

dency towards both reduced saving efforts and 
an adjustment in terms of saving objectives.
Measured in terms of the share of households 
who claim to regularly save, the data collected 
in 2017 show no evidence of a decline in sav -
ing efforts. Around 63% of the households re -
port that they put aside a set amount of money 
every month, meaning there has even been a 
4  percentage point rise in that share since 
2014. At the same time, the proportion of 
households who say they are unable to save 
because they lack the financial means has fallen 
by 4 percentage points. The favourable condi -
tions on the labour market are likely to be a 
factor in this.
Over the three waves, the PHF study also pro -
vides insights into why households save. Mo -
tives for saving have evidently changed over 
time. The proportion of households citing buy -
ing property as their main motive for saving 
grew between 2010 and 2017. An increase was 
apparent between 2010 and 2014 especially 
among younger households, for whom this 
motive is traditionally particularly important 
(see the chart on p. 28), while a slight fall in the 
share can be seen between 2014 and 2017.
Over the last three years, the share of house -
holds for whom renovating, refurbishing or ex -
tending a property is the main reason for sav -
ing has also increased,37 with around 9% citing 
it as their most important motivation in 2017. 
Rising property prices seem to be acting as in -
centives to invest in maintaining and upgrading 
real estate. Low interest rates are also making it 
possible for borrowers to obtain loans for reno -
vating an owner- occupied property at favour -
able conditions.
The proportion of households citing “retire -
ment provision” as their most important motive 
for saving, meanwhile, has dropped from 22% 
in 2010 to 17% in 2017. This decline is consist -
ent with the reduced share of households pos -
sessing long- term savings deposits and con -
tracts for private retirement provision described above. The waning significance of this motive 
for saving was already apparent between 2010 
and 2014 and can be seen across all age 
groups, but is particularly pronounced among 
the older households over 65 years of age. For 
that group, saving is increasingly motivated by 
supporting children and grandchildren and by 
legacy and gifting purposes.
Households’ debt situation
The primary focus of this article so far has been 
households’ wealth and how that wealth is 
structured. For central banks, however, it is not 
just households’ investment behaviour that is 
of interest but also the decisions households 
make when it comes to borrowing. The house -
hold debt situation can be ascertained by refer -More than half

ence to various indicators. These include, for 
instance, the proportion of indebted house -
holds, the level of debt and measures of house -
holds’ debt sustainability.
According to the PHF study, there has been 
barely any change in the share of indebted 
households between 2010 and 2017: the per -
centage of households with some kind of out -
standing debt38 still stands at roughly 45%. 
Very little has changed with respect to the 
underlying structures, too. Fewer households 
have mortgage loans than have unsecured 
types of credit but, as is to be expected, the 
amounts owed on mortgage loans are far higher (median: €81,000) than outstanding 
amounts for other loans (median: €4,900). 
Both values are higher than in 2014; in particu -
lar, the outstanding amounts for unsecured 
loans are still low.
More important than the absolute amount of 
outstanding debt is debt sustainability, in other 
words the interplay between income, indebt -
edness and debt service. The ratio of debt ser -
vice, i.e. interest and principal repayments, to 
net income frequently figures in analyses re -
lated to issues of financial stability and in a 
monetary policy context.39
Moving up the income scale, both the share of 
households with outstanding debt and the 
amount owed by this group of households 
rises. Out of the households with an annual net 
income of up to around €13,200, roughly 32% 
had debts outstanding in 2017; in the group of 
households with an annual net income of over 
€37,200, meanwhile, the figure was slightly 
greater than 60%.
Interest and principal repayments as a share of 
net income fell from an average of 23% to 
20% between 2010 and 2017. As the chart on 
page 29 shows, the top tail of the distribution 
in particular saw changes compared with 2014. 
From about the seventh decile, we start to see 
a decrease. The ninth decile starts out at 37% 
of net income in 2017; in 2010 that figure was 
47% and in 2014 it stood at 42%. Households 
with high interest and principal repayments in 
2017 were thus also needing to use a smaller 
portion of their income to cover them.
There are two factors which likely play a role in 
this change: the increase in households’ net in -
come and the persistently low lending rates. 
Looking at purely the interest element of debt 
service as a proportion of income, there was a 
very strong decrease of 4  percentage points Share of

between 2010 and 2017 to an average of 6% 
for indebted households. A significant part of 
the reduction in debt service relative to net in -
come can thus be attributed to lower interest 
payments for new loans or loans where the 
fixed interest rate has expired.
Summary
The PHF study provides an overview of the fi -
nancial situation of households in Germany in 
2017. It shows that both the average wealth of 
households and the median increased signifi -
cantly between 2014 and 2017. Net wealth 
rose particularly in those sections of the distri -
bution containing a high proportion of prop -
erty owners. The findings thus again highlight 
the important role played by real estate in 
households’ asset holdings.
Compared with the results for 2014 and 2010, 
it is also evident that households in Germany 
remain hesitant to invest in securities, and hold 
a substantial portion of their wealth in liquid 
forms of investment that are perceived as low 
risk, despite the fact that these are currently 
only yielding low returns. There are initial indi -
cations that fewer households are investing in 
longer- term assets such as voluntary private 
pension plans or whole life insurance policies. When it comes to debt, households are bene -
fiting from low lending rates.
Measures of inequality exhibited only minor 
changes between 2014 and 2017 and no clear 
trend is discernible. While the standard indica -
tors used to measure inequality – such as the 
Gini coefficient and the share of total net 
wealth held by the wealthiest households – fell 
slightly, the gap between the upper and lower 
part of the distribution widened. Germany re -
mains a country in which wealth is distributed 
unequally.
The PHF study testifies to the fact that wealth 
distribution and the underlying portfolio struc -
tures of Germany’s households are changing 
only slowly. Even against a backdrop of strong 
asset price hikes, sustained low interest rates 
and a healthy economy, there were no major 
shifts so far as measured inequality and port -
folio structures were concerned.

* Gross income is the sum of the income components included in the survey. By contrast, net income is the respondent’s self-assessment

Interest rate pass- through in the low 
interest  rate environment
The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) responded to the financial and sover -
eign debt crisis by reducing key policy rates in the euro area to historical lows. June 2014 saw it 
shift the interest rate on the deposit facility into negative territory for the first time. Other non- 
standard monetary policy measures such as the public sector purchase programme (PSPP) and 
forward guidance aimed, amongst other things, to drive down market rates in the longer- term 
segment. Monetary policy accommodation caused banks to substantially loosen their lending 
policies, slashing their lending rates since 2014 to what are now unprecedented lows. Euro area 
credit institutions were far more hesitant in reducing the interest rates they pay on customer 
deposits, however. Most of them did not follow money market rates into negative territory, leav -
ing their rates instead marginally above the zero mark.
To date, the negative interest rate environment seen over the past four years has not impacted 
on long- term interest rate pass- through to bank lending rates. Indeed, the findings of a cointegra -
tion analysis indicate that changes in the EURIBOR are being passed through almost in full to 
bank rates for loans to enterprises over the long run. As for the short- term impact of the non-  
standard monetary policy measures and the way in which the negative interest rate environment 
is affecting interest rate pass- through, a more flexible model framework that incorporates time 
variability into the empirical analysis tends to provide better insights.
Empirical analyses which the Bundesbank has carried out using just such a model framework sug -
gest that interest rate pass- through has been supported by the non- standard monetary policy 
measures taken since 2011. We find that the changes in monetary policy were passed through in 
full to bank lending rates up until 2016. The persistence of the period of negative interest rates 
caused interest rate pass- through to weaken somewhat in 2016, since which time it has been 
roughly at the same level as it was back in 2011. Bank deposit rates have been anchored just 
above zero since the middle of 2016, and this will probably have been one major obstacle to 
further significant cuts in lending rates.
The more protracted the spell of negative rates, the greater the likelihood that the weakening of 
interest rate pass- through in the short- term segment might, at some point, spill over into the 
long- term parameters as well. Bear in mind, however, that a weakened pass- through of accom -
modative monetary policy impulses is taking place against a backdrop of historically low lending 
rates and that the estimates at the current juncture are implying that interest rate pass- through, 
though weaker, is still almost complete. Therefore, the level of lending rates is arguably still hav -
ing a significantly accommodative impact on lending activity.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
Central banks use their monetary policy toolkit 
to exert influence over variables including gen -
eral interest rate levels in order to achieve their 
monetary policy objectives. The primary object -
ive of the Eurosystem is to safeguard price sta -
bility in the euro area. Monetary policy meas -
ures are transmitted to prices through a variety 
of transmission channels, and credit institutions 
play a key role in this regard. For one thing, 
they are the monetary policy counterparties of 
the Eurosystem, putting them at the very out -
set of the transmission process. For another, 
bank loans still represent a significant source of 
finance for many non- banks in the euro area, 
even if funding structures have diversified over 
recent years to make greater use of equity cap -
ital and alternative debt instruments.
Monetary policy is transmitted through the 
banking system to influence financing condi -
tions for firms and households. The interest 
rate channel works on the assumption that 
monetary policy measures affect market rates 
directly and banks’ lending and deposit rates 
indirectly.1 The latter is what is known as inter -
est rate pass- through (see the chart below). 
This channel is used to transmit interest rate 
impulses to loan dynamics, economic activity 
and ultimately the price level. The effectiveness of this channel depends on whether changes in 
monetary policy rates are passed through in full 
and without much of a delay.
The Governing Council of the ECB responded 
to the financial crisis of 2008-09 and the Euro -
pean sovereign debt crisis of 2010-12 by cut -
ting key interest rates to historical lows. June 
2014 saw it shift the interest rate on the de -
posit facility into negative territory. Short- term 
market rates in the euro area moved in tandem 
with the stepwise reduction of the policy rate 
level before likewise dropping below zero for 
the most part. The looming zero lower bound 
made it increasingly difficult to perceptibly in -
crease the degree of monetary policy accom -
modation any further by means of policy rate 
cuts. In an effort to nonetheless achieve con -
tinued policy easing, the Governing Council de -
cided to augment its action on the policy rate 
front by adding a raft of non- standard monet -
ary policy measures so as to exert direct and 
indirect influence on longer- term market rates Banks play key

more, a number of these measures were de -
signed to directly address banks’ funding 
costs.3
Persistently low interest rates are an unusual 
backdrop for the euro area’s banking system. 
The introduction of negative rates, especially, 
saw monetary policymakers embark on a jour -
ney into what was largely uncharted territory. 
Indeed, lacking past experience, they had 
barely any theoretical or empirical insights into 
how monetary policy impulses are transmitted 
through the banking system in periods of nega -
tive rates. Because banks adapt their business 
policy in response to a variety of factors, it is 
not necessarily the case that the exceptional 
interest rate setting is a reason, let alone the 
sole cause, for changes in their business strat -
egy. The financial crisis and the uncertainty and 
disruption it caused are likely to have left their 
mark on the transmission process. Much the 
same can be said for the reform of banking regulations and the prudential regime as part 
of the implementation of Basel III and the 
launch of the European banking union. That 
said, the findings gleaned from the Bundes -
bank’s empirical analyses suggest that rates 
which persist in low but positive territory, but 
above all a backdrop of negative rates, have so 
far not impacted on interest rate pass- through 
over the long term, even if changes are cer -
tainly evident over the short term.Low rates

Banks’ rate- setting behaviour 
in the low interest rate 
 environment
Differently structured though the national 
banking systems in the euro area may be, they 
nonetheless share striking similarities in terms 
of how bank loans and customer deposits are 
priced. Banks generally gear the rates they set 
to a certain market rate (reference interest 
rate).4 When interest rates are at normal levels, 
the rate they pay on customer deposits is this 
reference interest rate less a markdown.5 This is 
what usually makes deposits a cheaper means 
of finance for banks than any other source of funds with a similar maturity. The bank lending 
rate, by contrast, is usually computed by apply -
ing a mark- up to the chosen reference interest 
rate.6 This way, banks try to at least cover their 
business expenses on average. These are made 
up of items including the cost of capital, ex -
pected credit losses, funding costs and operat -Interest rate set -

ing expenses.7 While a bank’s mark- up on cap -
ital and expected credit losses will tend to be 
higher for debtors which are more likely to de -
fault, its funding costs and business expenses 
will depend not on its borrowers’ credit quality 
but above all on the business model it runs.
Using a model to arithmetically break down the 
composite lending rate, it is possible to illus -
trate how each of the cost components affect 
the lending rates set by banks (see the chart on 
p. 46). This decomposition process is based on 
the assumption that banks set their rates for 
loans to non- financial corporations based not 
only on a reference interest rate8 but also on 
other cost components:
– their funding costs;9
– credit risk, measured in terms of expected 
credit losses in the non- financial corporate 
sector;
– unexpected credit losses and other costs in -
cluding, for example, equity costs, which are 
shown in the chart as the residual, or inter -
mediation margin. This is calculated as the 
spread between the lending rate and the 
sum of the cost components (including the 
reference interest rate).
However, just as this kind of breakdown offers 
scant insights into the underlying causalities, 
so, too, would it be wrong to say that the de -
scription applies to specific individual banks. 
Since the breakdown considers lending busi -
ness to be the sole source of interest income, 
the findings of this analysis apply primarily to 
banks running traditional business models.
What the breakdown reveals for credit institu -
tions engaged predominantly in classic credit 
business is that the interest income they earn 
from loans to enterprises, when viewed from 
the customary perspective, was insufficient to 
cover the cost of granting loans, not only dur -
ing the years of crisis but in and after 2014 as 
well. It would appear, then, that banks are set -ting their lending rates for loans to enterprises 
too low in the negative interest rate environ -
ment, meaning that, by rights, their net interest 
income10 from traditional corporate lending 
business ought to be negative.
According to the results actually reported by 
banks in the euro area as a whole, net interest 
income has been declining since 2015, but it 
has not turned negative. This is primarily due to 
the costs associated with expected credit 
losses. The customary method of calculation 
(which is also used here) assumes that banks 
write off the entire loan if a borrower defaults 
(exposure at default).11 Given the scope permit -
ted by banking regulations, this is not necessar -
ily how the banks themselves account for credit 
losses.12 An exposure at default of less than 
100% reduces the size of the bars representing 
expected credit losses in the chart on page 46, 
which means it would lower the costs.13 In 
other words, less income would be needed to 
cover the costs. The optimistic view which 
banks take when measuring their credit risk is 
evident both in the empirical literature and, say, Key components

7 In a business- accounting sense, this is how a bank calcu -
lates its minimum margins. Banks use this approach as part 
of their internal accounting operations to set prices in 
interest- based business which cover their costs. Other 
sources of bank revenue, such as net commission income, 
do not feature in this calculation. For euro area banks, net 
interest income is the chief source of earnings, accounting 
for roughly 60% of operating profit or loss. See European 
Central Bank (2017a), pp. 40 f.

ing down the composite interest rate.
9 The calculation used in the chart on p. 46 proxies fund -
ing costs as the spread between funding costs and a risk- 
free rate over a similar maturity. The exercise also assumes 
by implication that banks in the euro area use customer 
deposits and bank debt securities as their sole source of 
funding. These are by far the most important sources of 
funding for the aggregated banking system in the euro 
area. In 2018, bank funding in the euro area consisted, on 
average, of 40% of customer deposits and roughly 14% of 
bank debt securities.

the results of the comprehensive assessment of 
banks in the euro area.14
In a break from standard business practice, de -
posit rates have been set above rather than 
below short-  term market rates ever since key 
interest rates were lowered in response to the 
financial crisis and particularly in the wake of 
the fresh round of rate cuts in 2012. In other 
words, banks are calculating their deposit rates 
by applying a mark- up, rather than a mark -
down, to the reference rate (see the above 
chart).15 As the rates paid on customer deposits 
approached zero, banks responded by making 
only minimal reductions to their deposit rates.16 
Only as from 2013 or thereabouts did the 
mark- up stop rising and stabilise at a relatively 
high level. Since 2016, both market and de -
posit rates have persisted at their respective 
levels: short- term market rates deep in negative 
territory and deposit rates still just above zero. 
The spread between deposit and market rates, 
having now turned positive, is a relevant cost 
factor primarily for banks engaged in trad -
itional banking business.
The extent to which this structural change in 
the pricing of customer deposits (mark- up in -
stead of markdown) impacts on bank lending 
rates depends on the individual bank’s funding 
structure and business model.17 Banks tend to actively manage their net interest margin18 with 
a view to keeping it as stable as possible over 
time (margin smoothing).19 They do so by exer -
cising their market power, but at the same time 
they are subject to a number of constraints 
(competition, business- accounting and regula -
tory requirements). Banks will thus adjust their 
conditions for loans and deposits so as to 
achieve their target margins. Hence, there is a 
long- term correlation between lending and de -
posit rates which can be proven empirically by 
means of cointegration analysis.20
The way in which margins were shaped altered 
upon entering a negative interest rate environ -
ment, however. Although lending and finan -
cing decisions were being taken continuously 
and simultaneously as before, there was a con -
siderable weakening of the long- term relation -
ship between lending and deposit rates.21 This 
was the outcome of widely differing interest 
rate dynamics: while there was a marked and 
steady decline in lending rates between 2014 
and 2016, sight and savings deposit rates 
underwent less and less change, the closer 
they came to the zero lower bound (see the Deposit rates

14 The asset quality review component of the ECB’s com -
prehensive assessment of 130 banks in 2014 resulted in 
additional provisions of €42.9 billion due to the revised 
valuation of loans. See ECB (2014a), p. 79. The costs of 
forbearance are discussed in Caballero et al. (2008). For the 
euro area, see Homar et al. (2015).
15 Just how crucial a positive deposit rate spread is for Ger -
man banks, at least, is also evident from the findings of the 
Bundesbank’s survey on the low interest rate setting. See 
Drescher et al. (2016).
16 See Darracq Pariès et al. (2014). A zero lower bound 
does not exist in all deposit categories, but it is a major 
feature for household deposits. Euro area banks certainly 
do charge negative rates on large- scale sight deposits by 
households or non- financial corporations. Overall, though, 
this is only the case in a handful of countries.

adjacent chart).22 The declining long- term rela -
tionship and the differing dynamics show that, 
in the euro area, the rigidity of deposit rates up 
to 2016 was not transmitted to lending rates. 
These differing developments in lending and 
deposit rates led to net interest income from 
banks’ traditional lending business in the euro 
area undergoing a decline since 2014, in par -
ticular.
Euro area banks attempted to counter declin -
ing net interest income by making various ad -
justments to their business policy. While the 
aggregate interest rate for new bank loans re -
mained more or less constant since 2016 at an 
all- time low, particularly banks engaged pre -
dominantly in traditional deposit and lending 
business tried to generate additional earnings 
through a massive expansion of their business 
volume and increased maturity transform -
ation.23 For banks, both involve higher risks. 
Growing credit volumes drive up credit risk, 
and increasing credit growth tends to reduce 
the average quality of borrowers.24 Greater ma -
turity transformation is reflected in higher inter -
est rate risk.25 The fact that banks assumed the 
described risks on a larger scale rather than 
raising the lending rate is likely to have been 
due to the intense competition in lending busi -
ness. This is suggested by the results of the Eu -
rosystem’s Bank Lending Survey (BLS), which, 
from 2014 onwards, show the surveyed institu -
tions stating that competition from other banks 
was the most important reason for the easing 
of their credit standards.
The BLS also asks explicitly about the impact of 
various monetary policy measures on net inter -
est income. Around three- quarters of all the 
participating euro area banks stated that the 
negative deposit facility rate was weighing on 
their net interest income (see the chart on 
p. 50). This statement probably relates, above Banks respond

25 Interest rate risk is assessed using a measure proposed 
by Drechsler et al. (2017):  
 
ΔNIMt = α + s=12X
s=0s ΔEuribort- s + ϵt.   
 
The change in the net interest margin is regressed on the 
change in the three- month EURIBOR (number of lags = 12 
months). For the period from January 2003 to December 
2008, this gives a βNIM of 0.1. Drechsler et al. (2017) calcu -
late a β of 0.02 for larger US banks. Hoffmann et al. (2018) 
estimate a β of 0.04 for larger euro area banks. For the 
period from 2008, however, there is a β which is negative 
or close to zero. This means that euro area banks’ interest 
income is reacting much less sensitively than they did as 
recently as before 2008, which points to heightened inter -
est rate risk. It may be assumed that banks using more ma -
turity transformation to stabilise their income do not hedge 
their interest rate risk because such hedging would negate 
the additional earnings.Deutsche Bundesbank

all, to margin compression resulting from the 
lower general interest rate level due to the 
negative interest rate on deposits.26 The isol -
ated effect of this negative remuneration of ex -
cess liquidity is, from a quantitative perspective, 
of secondary importance for banks’ profitabil -
ity. With regard to the monetary policy asset 
purchase programmes, under which the Euro -
system has been buying securities on a major 
scale since spring 2015, only about one- third of 
banks stated that this was having negative ef -
fects on their net interest margin. The asset 
purchase programmes progressively lowered 
the longer- term market rates, leading to a 
marked flattening of the yield curve in the euro 
area. According to the BLS, this had a negative 
impact especially on the profitability of those 
banking systems in the euro area where long 
interest rate fixation periods have been pre -
dominant in the loan portfolio (see the above 
chart). This does not affect the banking sys -
tems of most euro area countries, however.Interest rate pass- through
Role of reference interest rates
Interest rate pass- through assumes that monet -
ary policy interest rate changes impact on 
banks’ lending and deposit rates through the 
market rates. Before the financial crisis, the Eu -
rosystem steered the short- term money market 
rates by regularly providing liquidity at the main 
refinancing rate. As the short- term money mar -
ket rates reflect not only the current level of 
policy rates but also expectations about their 
future level, they are typically used as a proxy 
for the monetary policy stance.27 Besides this, 
however, the level of money market rates is Short- term

rates can still be

also affected by risk premia, the degree of seg -
mentation in the money market, as well as the 
liquidity situation in the banking system. These 
factors became much more important in the fi -
nancial crisis, resulting in the EURIBOR, for ex -
ample, containing a non- negligible risk pre -
mium for a time. Heightened risk perception in 
the money market led, in turn, to banks having 
a greatly increased demand for central bank li -
quidity, which was met by full allotment28 in 
the refinancing operations. The abundant sup -
ply of liquidity resulted in short-  term money 
market rates falling below the level of the main 
refinancing rate and, at times, even closely ap -
proaching the deposit rate. Even so, they can 
still be used in principle as a proxy for the cur -
rent and expected monetary policy rate. The 
EONIA, in particular, may still be regarded as 
the optimum proxy for the Eurosystem’s inter -
est rate policy.29
The large- scale non- standard measures mean 
that the overall degree of monetary policy eas -
ing, however, can no longer be measured solely 
by a single money market rate. Along with 
interest rate policy, these non- standard monet -
ary policy measures determine the monetary 
policy stance. For that reason, instead of a 
money market rate or a derivative from it, an 
artificial interest rate, the shadow rate, has 
been used for some years now as a proxy for 
monetary policy.30
The choice of the reference interest rate is of 
particular importance for the analysis of inter -
est rate pass- through. It should, ideally, be a 
good proxy for monetary policy, on the one 
hand, and, on the other, be as close as possible 
to the reference interest rate used by the banks. 
Up to the financial crisis, the EURIBOR fulfilled 
both criteria to an adequate extent. Using it 
made it possible to predict movements in lend -
ing rates with a high degree of precision. 
EURIBOR with a maturity between 3 and 12 
months, in particular, is used as a reference 
interest rate by euro area banks.31 It has a vital 
anchor function for the banks’ funding. Many 
financial transactions are linked to it, with high market liquidity in the transactions being a 
major criterion.32 EURIBOR with maturities of 
up to one year is used, for example, in quotes 
for capital market instruments and as a basic 
rate of interest for bank bonds with a variable 
nominal rate of interest. That is why banks use 
EURIBOR as a reference interest rate for calcu -
lating both their funding costs and their lend -
ing rates.33
Role of market power
For lending rates in the euro area, empirical 
studies find an almost complete interest rate 
pass- through at least up to the financial crisis, 
while the pass- through to deposit rates ap -
pears to be incomplete.34 An incomplete pass- 
through of changes in reference interest rates 
might be an indication of oligopolistic struc -
tures in the European banking market. Such 
structures probably tended to become stronger 
following the financial crisis, especially in na -
tional banking sectors that were less concen -
trated up to that point. This is suggested by 
calculations of customary measures of concen -
tration in a number of euro area countries.35 
From a theoretical standpoint, such an explan -
ation could be supported by the oligopolistic 
version of the Monti- Klein model, which shows 
that the lower the intensity of competition in Owing to the 
non- standard 
measures, the

34 Before the financial crisis, an average of 36% (10%) of 
a reference rate change was passed through to euro area 
lending rates (sight and savings deposit rates) within the 
first month. The degree of long- term interest rate pass-  
through in the euro area prior to the financial crisis was 
close to 100% on average for lending rates, compared 
with around 33% in the case of sight and savings deposit 
rates. See European Central Bank (2009); as well as Bern -
hofer and van Treeck (2013).
35 The increase in the Herfindahl concentration index and 
in the relative importance of the five largest national credit 
institutions was probably due to resolutions and mergers of 
banks in the wake of the financial and sovereign debt crisis.Deutsche Bundesbank

the banking market, the more the degree of 
interest rate pass-through will decline.36 This 
seems plausible, as imperfect competition gives 
banks substantial market power over their cus -
tomers. Besides this effect, yet more factors 
strengthen the market power of the banks.37 
These include the costs of switching to another 
bank or customers being dependent on a 
stable bank- customer relationship, say, in the 
case of small enterprises. Given their strong 
preference for liquidity, demand for sight de -
posits is especially high among depositors. 
Such factors reduce the interest rate elasticity 
of demand for bank products. The empirical 
finding that the interest rate pass- through is 
less strongly marked in the case of deposit 
rates than it is for lending rates suggests that 
banks are likely to have greater market power 
over their depositors than they do over their 
creditors.38
In addition, banks’ cost calculations influence 
movements in bank interest rates. This may be 
due to the costs of adjusting prices (menu 
costs)39 if banks are slow to adjust their interest 
rates or do so incompletely following changes 
to the reference rates. Costs are reduced if 
interest rates are not adjusted continuously, but 
rather in stages whenever the change in the 
reference rate and, therefore, the deviation 
from interest rates on existing loan agreements 
has reached a certain magnitude.40 Moreover, 
the stickiness of bank interest rates depends 
positively on the volatility of the market and 
policy rates.41 Firmly anchored interest rate ex -
pectations and a well- communicated monetary 
policy therefore encourage a rapid interest rate 
pass- through.
Implications of a change in 
the mark- up for interest rate 
pass- through
In the empirical literature,42 both a widening of 
the spread between the bank interest rate and 
the reference interest rate (the mark-  up) and 
weaker correlation between the two variables are often interpreted as indicators of weaker 
interest rate pass-  through.43 In the euro area, 
the mark- up between the lending rate44 and 
the three- month EURIBOR has indeed risen 
considerably since the end of 2008, having 
shown an almost continuous decline prior to 
this (see the chart on p. 53).45
However, such a rise does not directly indicate 
a change in interest rate pass- through. First, in 
the context of an incomplete46 pass- through, 
the mark- up is not necessarily constant, but 
varies over the interest rate cycle: when interest 
rates go up, the lending rate rises less sharply 
than the reference interest rate. The two inter -
est rates thus converge, meaning that the 
mark- up becomes smaller. Conversely, when 
interest rates go down, the mark- up increases 
because a decline in the reference interest rate 
is likewise not fully passed through to the bank

Driscoll and Judson (2013); as well as Sander and Kleimeier 
(2004).

From a monetary policy perspective, it is the pass- through 
estimations for lending rates that are particularly interest -
ing since they translate directly into consumption and in -
vestment decisions. As a key component of the cost of 
borrowing, deposit rates influence how banks decide to set 
their interest rates. The analyses presented in the literature 
and in this article therefore focus on lending rates.

loan segments according to the harmonised MFI interest 
rate statistics.
45 The banks participating in the BLS mainly attributed the 
decrease in the spread between the lending rate and the 
market rate since 2013 to the intense competition in lend -
ing business in the euro area.
46 The way in which the mark- up is calculated means it 
can only be considered as the degree to which interest 
rates are passed through in the short term, i.e. the change 
in the bank interest rate in the month in which the refer -
ence interest rate changed. As explained in footnote 34, 
this pass- through was also incomplete before the financial 
crisis.Deutsche Bundesbank

lending rate. This was demonstrated clearly 
when, after interest rates were slashed in the 
wake of the financial crisis, the lending rate fol -
lowed suit to only a limited extent.
Second, the development of the mark- up looks 
different if it is calculated using the average 
funding costs47 of banks rather than the refer -
ence interest rate (see the adjacent chart). 
When calculating the mark- up between the 
lending rate and the funding costs, no increase 
is evident after the financial crisis as opposed to 
before it. On the contrary, after the financial 
crisis, the mark- up first declined strongly and 
then recovered gradually until coming to rest at 
more or less its pre- crisis level from around 
2015. In the context of banks’ average funding 
costs, it was the zero lower bound on interest 
rates, in particular, that prevented the mark- up 
from increasing more sharply. The evidence 
that the mark- up expanded therefore seems to 
be based purely on the choice of the reference 
interest rate as the reference variable for the 
calculation.
Third, if a period of low interest rates coincides 
with a period of weak economic activity, the 
increased risk on the borrower side counteracts 
a drop in bank lending rates.48 In line with this, 
the results of the BLS indicate that between 
2008 and the end of 2013, borrower- side risks 
were the main reason for the euro area banks’ 
more restrictive lending policies (see the top 
chart on p. 54).
For these reasons, an expansion in the mark- up 
would be compatible with both a change and 
no change in interest rate pass- through. Be -
sides this, it is reasonable to assume that the 
mark- up is influenced by additional factors be -
yond those listed above. Interpreting the find -
ings in relation to pass- through therefore re -
quires empirical methods that allow this to be 
estimated. For example, ex post projections 
produced using a simple error correction model 
suggest that models specified in this way may 
not adequately reflect pass- through at the 
present time. Prior to the financial crisis, move -ments in lending rates could be predicted with 
a high degree of precision using a pass- through 
model of this kind with just one explanatory 
variable – the three- month EURIBOR. From 
2009 onwards, however, the forecast shows 
that the actual lending rate increased more 
strongly than the model for the pre- crisis period 
implied (see the bottom chart on p. 54). Since 
the outbreak of the financial crisis, it is evident 
that the development of bank lending rates can 
no longer be explained using this reference 
interest rate alone.
The loss of confidence and increased uncer -
tainty in the interbank market together with 
the surge in money market rates during the fi -

EURIBOR during the financial crisis. Monetary 
policymakers thus began to focus on the aver -
age funding costs of banks.49 This prompted 
Illes et al. (2015) to use the average funding 
costs of banks, rather than a reference interest 
rate, as an explanatory variable in their empir -
ical analysis of pass- through. In contrast to the 
estimation using the three- month EURIBOR, 
the authors find that the lending rates de -
veloped as would have been expected on the 
basis of this indicator prior to the financial cri -
sis, too. This finding suggests that the relation -
ship between the reference interest rate and 
the funding costs of banks changed during the 
crisis and this had an impact on the pricing of 
loans.50 Although the EURIBOR thus appears to 
remain an important reference interest rate for 
banks, it no longer seems to capture all the in -
formation that determines banks’ funding costs 
and, ultimately, the lending rate.
A cointegration analysis performed as part of 
an error correction model that includes a refer -
ence interest rate as an explanatory variable 
produces a similar result. It shows no signifi -
cant long- term relationship between the inter -
est rate for new bank loans to enterprises and 
the three- month EURIBOR in the entire period 
spanning the last 15 years. Empirical tests for 
the existence of a structural break point to such 
a break during the sovereign debt crisis. How -
ever, if a measure of risk is added to the model 
– in this case, the sovereign risk premium51 – a 
significant long- term relationship between the 
three relevant variables becomes evident for

The coefficient of the long- term pass- through 
of changes in the reference interest rate is just 
over 80% for lending rates for enterprises. 
Pass- through is thus almost complete. By con -
trast, this long- term relationship cannot be 
proven empirically until 2010. By including the 
sovereign risk premium, the model would be 
misspecified until the start of the sovereign 
debt crisis.
Certain risks appear to affect pass- through, es -
pecially in times of crisis, while they are less sig -
nificant in other phases. During the financial 
and sovereign debt crisis, these risks were 
mainly liquidity and counterparty risk (of banks 
as well as sovereigns, enterprises and house -
holds). This was compounded by price drops in 
individual real estate markets and the crisis of 
confidence in the banking system. These risks 
had an impact on the level of lending rates, 
which monetary policymakers factored into 
their decisions.
The results of such cointegration analyses, 
which have been expanded to include a risk 
measure, provide valuable insights into the 
long- term equilibrium relationship between the 
reference interest rate used by the banks and 
the bank lending rate. Conversely, if the focus 
is on the impact of non- standard monetary 
policy  measures and the repercussions of the 
negative interest rate environment, it makes 
sense to adopt a more flexible model frame -
work that allows for time variability in eco -
nomic interrelationships.52
Pass- through in periods of 
non- standard monetary policy
Since the financial crisis broke out in 2008, the 
Governing Council of the ECB has adopted a 
raft of new monetary policy measures. Among 
these measures were negative interest rates for 
the deposit facility and various non-  standard 
monetary policy programmes, not to mention 
the increasing use of forward guidance. 
Amongst other things, the Governing Council attempted to push down yields at the long end 
of the yield curve using non- standard monetary 
policy measures.53 These included, in particular, 
the public sector purchase programme (PSPP) 
as part of the expanded asset purchase pro -
gramme (APP), which was adopted in January 
2015 (see the chart on p. 60). The empirical 
literature suggests that the announcements 
about the programme alone had a direct im -
pact on the market.54 According to estimations 
by Altavilla et al. (2015) and Andrade et al. 
(2016), announcements regarding the APP , 
which saw the purchase of government bonds 
with maturities of between 2 and 30 years, 
lowered yields on ten- year government bonds 
in the euro area by 30 to 50 basis points. Eser 
et al. (2019) identify similar effects. They also 
look at the impact of the net purchases under 
the PSPP up to the end of 2018 and estimate 
that these purchases reduced the yield on ten- 
year euro area government bonds by 100 basis 
points.
The fact that the yield curve shifted downwards 
repeatedly, as well as flattening out, was due in 
large part to the Eurosystem’s non- standard 
monetary policy measures. In 2016, yields on 
bonds of the Member States with the highest

they have increased again somewhat. None -

Long- term interest rate pass- through from the perspective 
of an error correction model
Single- equation error correction models 
(ECM) are well suited for an empirical analy-
sis of long- term interest rate pass- through. 
These have been used time and again in the 
past due to their intuitive interpretability (see, 
inter alia, de Bondt (2005)). The ECM ap-
proach used is given, in general, as follows:
brt=pX
j=0γjmr tj+pX
k=1δkbr tk
↵(brt1βmrt1µ)+" t
brt denotes the interest rate for new bank 
loans and mrt the reference interest rate.1 
The reference interest rate should approxi-
mate the banks’ marginal funding costs.2 
The coeffi   cient γ0 shows the degree to 
which a change in the reference interest 
rate in period zero is passed through to the bank lending rate within the same period 
(immediate pass- through).3 A highly posi-
tive value4 for γ0 indicates a rapid pass- 
through. An ECM requires a long- term 
equilibrium relationship between the rele-
vant variables in levels (term in brackets). 
This amounts to the same as having a co-
integration relationship. Statistical signifi  -
cance tests on the ECM parameters can be 
used to check whether there is a cointegra-
tion relationship between the bank lending 
rate and the reference interest rate. If α is 
positive in statistically signifi  cant terms, the 
integrated variables brt and mrt are cointe-
grated with the cointegration vector ( β, μ). 
β represents the coeffi   cient for the long- 
term interest rate pass- through. It shows 
the degree to which a change in the refer-
ence interest rate is passed through to the 
bank lending rate in the long- term equilib-
rium. If the pass- through is complete, there 
is a coeffi   cient of one. The constant μ de-
notes all of the time- invariable impacts that 
cannot be explicitly included in the equilib-
rium term. The adjustment coeffi   cient α 
demonstrates by how much a deviation 
1 ∆brt gives the change in the bank lending rate in 
comparison to the previous period. The model as-
sumes that the lending rate and reference interest rate 
time series are integrated of order one. The results of 
the ADF test do not reject this hypothesis.
2 Marginal funding costs are those costs that are in-
curred when taking on an additional unit of funding.
3 As, later on, only the effects of the unlagged refer-
ence interest rates are to be interpreted from the re-
sults, γj, j > 0 and δk are not outlined in greater detail. 
Including lagged changes in the bank lending and ref-
erence interest rates in the model serves to eliminate 
potential autocorrelation in the disturbances. The rele-
vant lag length is selected from all lags up to and in-
cluding lag ten using the Schwarz criterion.
4 A value of one means a 100%, i.e. a complete, pass- 
through. As the model contains additional time- lagged 
effects, it is also possible for these coeffi   cients to have 
values of over one.Lending and reference interest rates

from the long- term equilibrium relationship

In a fi  rst step, an ECM with the three- month 
EURIBOR6 as the reference interest rate is 
estimated for both categories of lending 
rate (loans to non- fi  nancial corporations 
and loans to households for house pur-
chase)7 at euro area level. If no cointegra-
tion relationship can be found with this ref-
erence interest rate, it is substituted with a 
longer- term market interest rate.8 In models 
for the interest rate pass- through for cor-
porate loans, no cointegration relationship 
with lending rates can be found in this way, 
however (see the table on p. 58).9 This may 
be due to the fact that these models do not 
consider a certain factor that is relevant to 
the interest rate pass- through, namely a risk 
measure. If the reference interest rate mrt 
in the model for the interest rate pass- 
through for corporate loans is expanded by 
a spread10 sprt as a risk measure, a long- 
term equilibrium relationship can be 
found.11 The expanded model is as follows:
brt=pX
j=0γjmr tj+pX
l=0✓lspr tl

Certain risks appear to affect the interest rate 
pass- through, especially in times of crisis, 
while they are less critical in other phases. It 
would seem that monetary policy has to con-
sider the impact of such factors, expressed 
here as the risk measure, if it is to bring about 
a change in the lending rate level.
When modelling the interest rate pass- 
through for loans to households for house 
purchase, a reference interest rate with a 
longer term (12- month EURIBOR) is re-
quired. This refl  ects the fact that, in some 
countries, loans issued to households for house purchase usually have a long interest 
rate fi  xation period.12 However, a risk meas-
ure is not necessary for a signifi  cant long- 
5 The parameters of an ECM can be estimated in the 
expanded form of the model. Banerjee et al. (1986) 
show that, in particular for small samples, it is better to 
estimate all parameters simultaneously in one equation 
than to use the Engle- Granger method (Engle and 
Granger (1987)) as this two- step method entails a risk 
of distorting the estimate of the long- term relation-
ship. The usual t statistic of the parameter α can be 
used to check whether there is a cointegration rela-
tionship between the bank lending rate and the refer-
ence interest rate, both of which are integrated of 
order one. As, under the null hypothesis, the t statistic 
of α is not t- distributed for fi  nite samples or asymptot-
ically, the adjusted critical values have to be used. Valid 
quantiles for the distribution of various sample sizes 
and the limit distribution can be found in Banerjee et 
al. (1998). The authors prove that this ECM test for 
cointegration is, in general, as precise as comparable 
cointegration tests. However, the latter are more sus-
ceptible to certain misspecifi  cations that can have a 
negative impact on the quality of the test.
6 Surveys of euro area banks revealed that the 
EURIBOR with a term of between three and 12 months, 
in particular, is used as a reference interest rate (see 
European Central Bank (2019)). These reference inter-
est rates can be used as a proxy for banks’ funding 
costs. Many loan contracts and hedging transactions 
reference the three- month EURIBOR as the underlying.
7 The analysis is based on the lending rate time series 
from the MFI interest rate statistics which have been 
collected monthly since January 2003. The estimation 
period runs from January 2003 to November 2018.
8 12- month EURIBOR as well as yields on sovereign 
bonds with various residual maturities.
9 Structural break tests indicate a break (during the 
sovereign debt crisis).
10 A sovereign risk premium, i.e. the difference be-
tween the yield on a ten- year sovereign bond and a 
risk- free interest rate (OIS rate) for the same maturity, 
is selected here as a general measure of risk. This ma-
turity is singled out because the market for ten- year 
sovereign bonds is the most liquid. However, the re-
sults do not vary greatly from those for spreads with a 
shorter- term underlying. A similar approach using a 
sovereign risk premium as an additional explanatory 
variable in an error correction model can be found in 
European Central Bank (2017b), p.  17 as well as in 
European Central Bank (2013), p. 90.
11 Estimations with rolling ten- year windows within 
the overall observation period also show cointegration 
relationships between the three variables (bank lend-
ing rate, reference interest rate and risk measure) for 
all sub- periods.

term relationship.13 Evidently, in this credit 
segment, a risk measure is not as key a fac-
tor as it is for corporate loans. Either that, 
or for loans for house purchase, those euro 
area countries where the size of the risk 
measure and its variation are too small to 
have a notable impact on lending rates are 
predominant.
The long- term pass- through coeffi   cient for 
the reference interest rate amounts to 0.84 
for corporate loans and 0.73 for loans to 
households for house purchase.14 The de-
gree of the pass- through is thus high and, 
at least for corporate loans, almost com-
plete.15 The coeffi   cient for the long- term 
pass- through of the risk measure in the 
model for corporate loans is also signifi  -
cantly different from zero and has an im-
portant magnitude. The speed of adjust-
ment is higher for corporate loans than for 
loans to households for house purchase. The immediate pass- through of changes in 
the reference interest rate in the fi  rst month 
amounts to 72% for corporate lending 
rates and only 13% for lending rates for 
house purchase. By contrast, changes in the 
risk measure are not passed on to corporate 
lending rates to a signifi  cant extent in the 
13 However, a model with a risk measure also has a 
signifi  cant adjustment speed (in this case, only a weak 
one) and thus shows a cointegration relationship be-
tween the bank lending rate, reference interest rate 
and risk measure. For estimates with rolling ten- year 
windows, there are sub- periods with and without a 
cointegration relationship in models with a risk meas-
ure as well as those without. Models for more recent 
time windows are more likely to fi  nd a cointegration 
relationship if they include a risk measure.
14 The absolute size of the constant is not meaningful 
due to the varying reference interest rates.
15 This fi  nding is in line with the literature on the inter-
est rate pass- through prior to the fi  nancial crisis. For 
loans both to fi  nancial corporations as well as for 
house purchase, the long- term interest rate pass- 
through is usually found to be high and almost com-
plete (see, for example, de Bondt (2005); Kok Sørensen 
and Werner (2006); Gambacorta (2008); as well as 
Marotta (2009)).Results of the pass- through models

The Governing Council of the ECB has repeat -
edly expressed concern that the monetary pol -
icy transmission mechanism in the euro area 
may be impaired.56 These impairments, as well 
as the various new monetary policy measures, 
have probably influenced and also changed 
interest rate pass- through. Thus, a flexible 
modelling approach in which the parameters 
can vary over time is needed. Time- varying vec -
tor autoregressive models offer this option. 
They can be used to examine how interest rate 
pass- through has changed – during times of 
crisis, for instance, or also in a low or negative 
interest rate environment.
Unlike cointegration analyses57 (see p. 55 and 
the box on pp.  56 ff.), vector autoregressive 
(VAR) models tend to focus on short- term pass-  
through. Two papers that investigate possible 
changes in short- term pass- through over the 
course of the financial crisis are those by Aristei 
and Gallo (2014) and Hristov et al. (2014).58 Both 
studies use VAR models and analyse the period prior to the financial crisis (2003 to 2007) and 
immediately afterwards (2008 to 2011). They 
find that short- term pass- through of a monetary 
policy shock to bank interest rates is less com -
plete in the wake of the financial crisis.59
Most studies use short- term money market 
rates as monetary policy indicators in order to 
analyse pass- through. However, these only re -
flect the changes and the level of the key inter -
est rates. Non- standard monetary policy meas -
ures, which were mainly added to the Euro-Time- varying 
method needed 
to analyse 
short-term 
pass-through 
in the current 
interest  rate 
environment
Empirical litera -
ture suggests 
weaker pass- 
through in the 
aftermath of 
the financial 
 crisis, …same month. It is thus especially important 
to include a risk measure in order to fi  nd a 
long- term equilibrium relationship between 
the reference interest rate and the lending 
rate.
The results of separate estimates for loans 
with short and with longer interest rate fi  x-
ation periods are generally consistent with 
the results on an aggregated level. A risk 
measure is required for both short- term and 
long- term corporate loans in order to dem-
onstrate a cointegration relationship. How-
ever, it is not required for loans to house-
holds for house purchase. For loans with a 
longer interest rate fi  xation period, models 
with longer- term reference interest rates 
are suitable.16
In conclusion, a long- term equilibrium rela-
tionship between the bank lending rate and 
a reference interest rate can be found in the model for the interest rate pass- through for 
corporate loans at euro area level only if the 
model is expanded to include a risk meas-
ure. In the model for the interest rate pass- 
through for loans for house purchase, how-
ever, a long- term equilibrium relationship 
exists only between the bank lending rate 
and a reference interest rate. The degree of 
the long- term pass- through of changes in 
the reference interest rate is high in both 
lending categories under observation and, 
at over 80%, is almost complete in the case 
of corporate loans.
16 As loans to households for house purchase with a 
long interest rate fi  xation period are issued primarily in 
Germany and France, an average yield on long- term 
sovereign bonds of AAA- rated euro area countries is 
the best fi  t for the reference interest rate.
56 See Draghi (2012); European Central Bank (2010a, 
2010b, 2014b).
57 These are based on single- equation error correction 
models, to which incorrectly assumed cointegration rela -
tionships pose problems. VAR models, on the other hand, 
avoid this potential misspecification (see de Bondt (2005) 
and von Borstel et al. (2016)).
58 Aristei and Gallo (2014) employ a Markov- switching 
VAR and Hristov et al. (2014) use a panel VAR for the euro 
area.
59 In both papers, the monetary policy indicator is proxied 
by short- term money market rates. Aristei and Gallo (2014) 
use the three- month EURIBOR and Hristov et al. (2014) use 
the EONIA.Deutsche Bundesbank

system’s  interest rate toolkit from 2011 on -
wards, have had only a limited impact on 
money market rates. That is why, for a few 
years now, a hypothetical interest rate referred 
to as the shadow interest rate has increasingly 
been used as a proxy for monetary policy. The 
shadow rate is used, for instance, by von Bor -
stel et al. (2016),60 who analyse the impact of 
both conventional and non- standard monetary 
policy measures.61 Compared to conventional 
interest rate changes prior to the financial cri -
sis, they estimate that pass- through of a non-  
standard monetary policy stimulus to lending 
rates was less complete during the European 
sovereign debt crisis. Their analysis covers the 
period up to 2013 and thus does not yet in -
clude the period of negative interest rates or 
the bulk of non- standard monetary policy 
measures taken by the Eurosystem.
To date, there have scarcely been any empirical 
studies on pass- through in a setting of negative 
market rates. The empirical study presented in the box on page 61ff. analyses short- term pass- 
through for the euro area using a Bayesian 
time- varying VAR model. It looks at how mon -
etary policy stimuli have impacted on bank 
interest rates for loans to non- financial corpor -
ations in the euro area (hereinafter: bank rates). 
Monetary policy is represented by EONIA or the 
shadow interest rate. EONIA proxies monetary 
policy in the model until the first quarter of 
2011, after which the shadow interest rate is 
used. Unlike EONIA, the shadow interest rate 
reflects not only interest rate policy, but also 
the announcements and implementation of 
non- standard monetary policy measures,62

Short- term interest rate pass- through from the perspective 
of a BVAR
This box analyses whether the short- term 
pass- through of monetary policy shocks to 
the lending rates of euro area commercial 
banks has changed in recent years due to 
the low interest rate environment (see 
Michaelis (2019)). A monetary policy shock 
is understood to be a change in monetary 
policy stance (see, inter alia, Sims (1992); as 
well as Christiano et al. (1999)). The low 
interest environment in particular could 
have led to changes in the interest rate 
pass- through because bank lending rates 
gradually approached the zero line. That is, 
there could have been systematic changes 
in the variances of the shocks and/ or in the 
dynamic effect of these shocks.
Time- variable VAR with sign restrictions
For the purpose of the analysis, a Bayesian 
time- variable vector autoregression (VAR) 
model1 is used for the euro area, in which 
three macroeconomic shocks are con-
sidered: a monetary policy shock as well as 
an aggregate demand and an aggregate 
supply shock. The shocks are identifi  ed with 
the help of sign restrictions. There are two reasons why two cyclical shocks are identi-
fi  ed besides the monetary policy shock. 
First, this prevents these disruptions from 
distorting the monetary policy shock. 
Second, the impact of these shocks on the 
endogenous variables can also be com-
pared over time.
The model contains fi  ve variables: real gross 
domestic product (GDP), the Harmonised 
Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), a short- 
term interest rate which describes monetary 
policy (represented by EONIA or a shadow 
rate), the bank lending rate for new loans 
to non- fi  nancial corporations and a sover-
eign bond spread.2 In the model, EONIA is 
used as a proxy for the ECB’s monetary pol-
icy up until the fi  rst quarter of 2011. From 
the second quarter of 2011, EONIA is re-
placed by the shadow rate (SR) from Wu 
and Xia (2018) for the euro area.3 From this 
point onwards, the two interest rates de-
velop differently: the shadow rate falls by 
more than EONIA (see the chart below). Al-
though the shadow rate is also a short- term 
rate,4 unlike EONIA it covers not only inter-
1 In the VAR model used, the coeffi   cients and the 
variance- covariance matrices are time- variable.
2 The spread is calculated as the interest rate spread 
between the synthetic ten- year euro area bond and 
ten- year German Bunds. Thus, the interest rate spread 
refl  ects the movements of the average risk premium in 
European sovereign bonds. Strong fl  uctuations in 
these premia (as seen, for example, during the fi  nan-
cial and European sovereign debt crisis) can have an 
impact on the interest rate pass- through. Thus, they 
have to be taken into consideration when determining 
the monetary policy shocks.
3 The results do not change much if the switch from 
EONIA to the shadow rate takes place earlier (e.g. the 
fi  rst quarter of 2010) or a little later than the second 
quarter of 2011.
4 The shadow rate is a hypothetical short- term interest 
rate which would attune without a nominal zero lower 
bound. It measures the pressure on longer- term inter-
est rates as a result of non- standard monetary policy 
measures. See also Deutsche Bundesbank (2017).EONIA and the shadow rate
Sources: Wu and Xia (2018), Thomson Reuters. 1 The shadow 
rate is based on calculations by Wu and Xia (2018). 2 From Q2 
2011, the shadow rate is used instead of EONIA in the time-va-
riable VAR model.

est rate policy but also, implicitly, the many 
non- standard monetary policy measures 
taken by the ECB’s Governing Council.5 This 
makes it a more suitable measure than 
EONIA for estimating the degree of monet-
ary policy easing in the low interest rate en-
vironment. In the following, we interpret 
the monetary policy impulse from the 
second quarter of 2011 onwards as a non- 
standard monetary policy shock. The litera-
ture, too, refers increasingly to the shadow 
rate in order to estimate the easing of mon-
etary policy.6
The estimation uses quarterly data7 from 
the fi  rst quarter of 1998 to the fourth quar-
ter of 2018.8 Real GDP and the HICP are 
included in growth rates9 (compared with 
the previous quarter) and the interest rates 
in fi  rst differences. For all the variables in 
the estimation the model contains a time 
lag of one quarter.10
The sign restrictions are set according to 
the usual assumptions in the literature11 
(see the table above).12 Accordingly, a re-
strictive monetary policy shock reduces 
both GDP and the HICP in the short term 
and increases EONIA/ SR. A negative aggre-
gate supply shock lowers GDP and increases 
prices as well as EONIA/ SR. It is assumed 
that a positive aggregate demand shock in-creases GDP , the HICP and EONIA/ SR. The 
lending rate and the sovereign bond spread 
remain unrestricted. Thus, the data deter-
mine the sign of these impulse responses. 
We are chiefl  y interested in the lending 
rate.
Results
The impulse responses show that the ef-
fects of a monetary policy shock (increase 
in  EONIA/ SR by one percentage point)13 
changed over time. The instantaneous pass- 
through14 of non- standard shocks to the 
lending rate appears to have weakened 
somewhat from the end of 2016 compared 
to the phase from mid-2013 to the begin-
ning of 2016 (see the adjacent table). Thus,

centile of the posterior distribution of the

further between 2011 and 2016, it also rolled out far- 
reaching non- standard monetary policy measures at 
the same time. These include the announcement of 
longer- term refi  nancing operations in June 2011, the 
OMT in August 2012 and the APP in January 2015.

and interest rates) are based on averages over the re-
spective months.
8 The training sample uses data from the fi  rst quarter 
of 1998 until the fourth quarter of 2003 and estimates 
the prior distribution of the model parameters. The ac-
tual estimation is based on data from the fi  rst quarter 
of 2004 until the fourth quarter of 2018.
9 GDP and HICP are seasonally adjusted.
10 The length of the time lags is based on the modi-
fi  ed harmonic mean estimator proposed by Geweke 
(1999). An examination of the dynamic stability of the 
system reveals that none of the eigenvalues is close or 
equal to one.

12 The sign restrictions which the impulse response 
functions must fulfi  l over a stipulated time period (see 
the table above) are chosen such that they enable the 
shock to be attributed plausibly, and on sound eco-
nomic foundations, to an exogenous monetary policy 
shock as well as separating it clearly from other shocks.
13 The structural shocks are normalised, which en-
sures that the shocks remain comparable over time.

impulse responses, has been below zero 
since the end of 2016 and so points to an 
impulse response that is no longer distin-
guishable from zero. That said, the interest 
rate pass- through is roughly comparable 
with that in 2011. The non- standard monet-
ary policy measures taken from 2011 likely 
amplifi  ed the interest rate pass- through 
until 2013. By contrast, the pass- through 
varied little between  mid-2013 and the be-
ginning of 2016. During this period, the im-
pulse responses suggest a complete pass- 
through. It has to be taken into consider-
ation, however, that the reliability bands 
around the estimated median of the im-
pulse responses are fairly wide.15
The calculation of posterior probabilities 
allows a statistical comparison of the differ-
ences in the impulse responses between 
different periods.16 Values close to 50% 
imply only weak differences between the 
periods under review.17 The analysis shows 
that there was actually little difference be-
tween the impulse responses of the lending 
rate from mid-2013 to the beginning of 
2016 (see the adjacent table). This is par-
ticularly true at the time of the shock and in 
the subsequent quarter. By comparison, the 
impulse responses are considerably lower 
15 From mid-2013 until the beginning of 2016, these 
are between roughly 0.3 and 3.3 percentage points at 
the time of the shock in period zero. The reliability 
bands refer to the 16th and 84th percentile of the pos-
terior distribution of the impulse responses.
16 The ratio of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo draw-
ings between two time periods is calculated. The 
points in time (fourth quarter of 2013, second quarter 
of 2014, etc.) are selected at random. They represent 
the different macroeconomic conditions. The com-
parative point in time is not chosen in 2018, as the 
points in time at the current end of a sample poten-
tially suffer from somewhat higher estimation uncer-
tainty.
17 Values above (below) 50% imply lower (higher) im-
pulse responses in the second quarter of 2014, for ex-
ample, than in the second quarter of 2017.Impacts of a one percentage point

euro area as of mid-2011.63 Therefore, in the 
following, monetary policy stimulus is inter -
preted as a non- standard monetary policy 
shock from this point in time onwards.
The model estimates show that pass- through 
has changed over recent years. From mid-2011 
onwards, i.e. with the increasing use of non-  
standard monetary policy measures, pass-  
through initially increased. It rose until mid-
2013 to a level indicative of complete pass-  
through. From mid-2013 until the beginning of 
2016, pass- through remained virtually un -
changed at this high level. The longer the 
negative interest rate environment has lasted, 
especially since the end of 2016, the weaker 
the effect of a non- standard monetary policy 
shock on the lending rate has been.64 In paral -
lel, at the start of 2017, the explanatory power 
of non- standard monetary policy shocks for 
bank rates also declined. By contrast, the ex -
planatory power of unidentified shocks in the 
model increased. These include, inter alia, shocks to risk premia. Taken together, this indi -
cates that pass- through was supported by the 
implementation of non- standard monetary pol -
icy measures and that monetary policy shocks 
were passed through in full to bank lending 
rates. Approximately one and a half years after 
the launch of the PSPP at the beginning of 
2015, pass- through then weakened somewhat. 
Nevertheless, it is roughly comparable to pass- 
through in 2011, i.e. when non- standard mon -
etary policy measures were first introduced.Estimates 
indicate  pass- 
through was 
 initially stronger, 
before weaken -
ing as of the 
end of 2016from the end of 2016.18 In addition, it can 
be seen that the impulse response in 2017 
hardly differs from that in 2011 at the time 
of the shock and immediately thereafter. 
The values are close to 50%.
In order to analyse the quantitative import-
ance of the respective shocks, the variances 
of the forecast errors are decomposed.19 
Demand shocks explain most of the vari-
ation of GDP . By contrast, supply shocks are 
most relevant for price variations. Monetary 
policy shocks in particular are the driving 
force behind the lending rate, although 
their importance for the lending rate 
changed over time. In 2017, this shock is far 
less important to the lending rate than in 
the preceding years. It already lost consider-
ably in importance in the second half of 
2016 compared with the fi  rst half of the 
year. On the other hand, the explanatory 
power of the unidentifi  ed shocks with re-gard to the lending rate increased. These 
cover all the remaining structural shocks 
such as a risk premium shock.20 Thus, the 
results of the variance decomposition also 
point to a weaker interest rate pass- through 
from the end of 2016.
18 This can be seen in the table from the fact that the 
values for the comparison of the fourth quarter of 
2016 with the second quarter of 2017 are close to 
50%, while the previous values of the comparisons (up 
to the fourth quarter of 2013) with the second quarter 
of 2017 are signifi  cantly lower.
19 In contrast to the impulse responses, the decom-
position takes account of the estimated standard devi-
ations of the shocks.
20 This is derived from the difference vis- à- vis the sum 
of the identifi  ed shocks. The shocks identifi  ed here in-
clude demand and supply shocks as well as the mon-
etary policy shock.
63 Examples of non- standard monetary policy measures 
announced by the ECB since mid-2011 include longer- term 
refinancing operations (LTROs) in June 2011, OMTs in 
August   2012, and the APP in January 2015. Furthermore, 
estimates show that the non- standard monetary policy 
measures since mid-2011 are likely to have increasingly in -
fluenced the shadow interest rate (see de Rezende and 
Ristiniemi (2018)).
64 These changes over time are evident, on the one hand, 
from the uncertainty bands of the impulse responses, and, 
on the other hand, from the calculation of the probability 
of statistical differences between the impulse responses at 
different points in time (see the box on pp. 61ff.).Deutsche Bundesbank

As the individual monetary policy measures are 
not modelled separately as shocks, and the 
shadow interest rate instead represents the en -
tirety of the measures, the analysis does not 
allow conclusions to be drawn on whether the 
complete set of non- standard monetary policy 
measures was necessary to achieve this trans -
mission of monetary policy stimulus. In the 
model specification used here, it is not possible 
to isolate and assess the impact of every single 
monetary policy decision.
At first glance, it may be surprising that pass-  
through has weakened since the end of 2016 
in spite of the continued extensive monetary 
policy measures. Although the ECB Governing 
Council announced at the end of 2016 that it 
did not intend to make its stance any more ac -
commodative, its monetary policy stance has 
remained clearly expansionary. At roughly the 
same time, from around mid-2016, the pro -
tracted period of massive cuts in lending rates 
by banks that started in March 2014 came to 
an end (see the above chart). Bank deposit 
rates, which have also hovered marginally 
above the zero mark since the middle of 2016, 
may have been a major factor preventing fur -
ther significant cuts in lending rates, which 
would have been accompanied by further falls 
in net interest income.65
Conclusion
Before the financial crisis, the Eurosystem 
steered short-  term money market rates by 
regularly providing liquidity at the main refinan -
cing rate. Monetary policy stimuli were trans -
mitted via the money market and capital mar -
ket rates to the lending and deposit rates of 
banks. During the financial crisis, uncertainty 
and the loss of confidence in the interbank 
market were among the factors which led to 
the reference rates being biased upwards. As a 
result, it was no longer possible to identify any 
long- term relationship between the lending 
rate and the reference rate. Certain risks appear 
to affect pass- through in times of crisis in par -ticular, while being less significant in other 
periods. This was the case, for example, for the 
effect of liquidity risk and counterparty risk on 
bank lending rates in the euro area. Monetary 
policymakers appeared to factor this into their 
decisions. Empirical tests carried out by the 
Bundesbank confirm the impact of these risks 
on pass- through in the aftermath of the finan -
cial crisis. For example, since 2010 there has 
been a long- term correlation between the 
lending rate, the reference rate and a sovereign 
risk premium.
The Governing Council of the ECB responded 
to the financial and sovereign debt crisis by re -
ducing key policy rates in the euro area to his -
torical lows. June 2014 saw it shift the interest 
rate on the deposit facility into negative terri -
tory for the first time. Other non- standard 
monetary policy measures such as the PSPP 
and forward guidance aimed, amongst other 
things, to drive down market rates in the 
longer- term segment. Monetary policy accom -
modation caused banks to substantially loosen 
their lending policies, slashing their lending 
rates as of 2014 to what are now also unpre -
cedented lows. However, euro area credit insti -
tutions were far more hesitant in reducing the Analysis does

interest rates they pay on customer deposits. 
Most of them did not follow money market 
rates into negative territory, leaving their rates 
instead marginally above the zero mark.
The negative interest rate environment over the 
last four years has thus far not impacted on 
long- term pass- through to lending rates. 
Changes in the EURIBOR are being passed 
through almost in full to bank rates for loans to 
enterprises over the long run. By contrast, as -
sessments of the short- term impact of non-  
standard monetary policy measures and the 
influence of the negative interest rate environ -
ment on pass- through are better made using a 
more flexible model framework that allows for 
time variability in economic interrelationships.
Time- variable empirical studies carried out by 
the Bundesbank using the shadow interest rate 
as a measure of the degree of monetary policy 
easing indicate that short- term pass- through 
has changed in recent years. According to 
these studies, pass-  through was initially sup -
ported by the non- standard monetary policy measures taken since 2011 and monetary pol -
icy shocks were therefore transmitted in full to 
bank lending rates. By contrast, during the 
period of negative interest rates, pass- through 
weakened somewhat and has since been 
roughly comparable to its level in 2011. Bank 
deposit rates persisting marginally above zero 
since the middle of 2016 may have been the 
predominant factor in preventing further sig -
nificant cuts in lending rates.
The more protracted the spell of negative rates, 
the greater the likelihood that the weakening 
of pass- through in the short-  term segment 
might, at some point, spill over into the long-  
term parameters as well. It should be noted, 
however, that a weakened pass- through of ac -
commodative monetary policy measures is tak -
ing place against a backdrop of historically low 
lending rates and that the estimates at the cur -
rent juncture imply that the interest rate pass- 
through, though weaker, is still almost com -
plete. Therefore, the level of lending rates is 
likely to still have a significantly accommodative 
impact on lending activity.Despite static

European Stability and Growth Pact: 
individual  reform options
Sound public finances are of crucial importance for a stability- oriented monetary union. This 
should therefore be what the European budget rules aim to achieve. The rules have been amended 
on numerous occasions, and changes are currently once again under discussion.
Any reform should uphold the fundamental objectives of the budget rules. If the medium-  term 
objectives (or MTOs) are achieved rapidly and maintained, the debt ratios will drop quickly from 
a high level. In order to render the quantitative targets more binding again, however, the rules 
have to be designed more transparently and implemented predictably. Therefore, large numbers 
of exceptions and scope for discretion should be dispensed with. Strict fiscal surveillance is also 
important. To this end, it would make sense to transfer the European Commission’s tasks to an 
independent, less political institution with its focus on monitoring compliance with the rules.
Various other adjustments are currently also being discussed. These include a stronger focus on 
expenditure ceilings. This could streamline the rules in various places. However, expenditure rules 
are also difficult in practice, and they open up new loopholes. This would have to be taken into 
account when designing the rules. In any event, expenditure ceilings should take the existing 
structural fiscal objectives as their frame of reference. In addition, they should be specified only 
for the next financial year, and not for a number of years.
A frequent complaint is that strict quantitative requirements are too narrow. In order to have a 
buffer even where limits are strict, national rainy day funds could be created and utilised. It 
should be possible to fund them in advance to the amount by which the MTO is overachieved. 
This would help prevent undesirable additional borrowing. It would be advisable to use such buf -
fers only in a rule- based manner to cover unexpected burdens. Proposals for a relatively compli -
cated rainy day fund at the European level do not make a convincing case, however. It is difficult 
to reconcile its joint financing with continued national responsibility for fiscal policy. Key object -
ives being pursued with European funds could also be achieved through national funds.
Frequent calls are made, moreover, for a “golden rule” to protect public investment. The prob -
lems associated with such an approach became evident, for instance, with the previous German 
budget rule, which was replaced with good reason. If a golden rule were nevertheless considered 
for the European rules, the associated risks, at least, should be minimised. Thus, investment 
should not justify unlimited additional deficits. No compromises should be made regarding the 
objective of rapidly declining high debt ratios, meaning that the MTO should be relaxed, if at all, 
only if the debt ratio is significantly below 60%. Also, the definition of investment should be nar -
row and harmonised. Moreover, only the build- up of additional assets should be encompassed, 
while capital depletion (negative net investment) would call for more ambitious fiscal positions.
Credible and binding fiscal rules help to limit the risks to stability and build confidence. However, 
their success will ultimately be determined by the Member States, which are responsible for fiscal 
policy. It is therefore vital that they raise their own funding on the capital market and are com -
pelled to present a convincing fiscal policy stance there.Deutsche Bundesbank

Debate on the Stability and 
Growth Pact
Sound public finances are important for the 
stability of the monetary union. They ensure 
that the Member States are capable of fiscal 
policy action and safeguard a stability- oriented 
monetary policy. Monetary policy could come 
under pressure to assist fiscal policy if confi -
dence in sound public finances is lost.
Within the monetary union, Member States de -
cide their own fiscal policy. The currently very 
low interest rates make it easier for them to 
shoulder their debt.1 However, high debt levels 
remain a risk to the stability of the monetary 
union.2 It would be risky to view the currently 
very low interest rates as permanent and there -
fore to pursue a strategy of high government 
debt levels. Rising interest rates might then 
quickly erode confidence in the soundness of 
public finances, with adverse effects on the 
Member State and the monetary union.
Jointly agreed fiscal rules should set binding 
limits and create confidence in the sustainabil -
ity of public finances. However, the fiscal rules 
can fulfil their purpose only if countries adhere 
to them. The European level cannot determine 
Member States’ fiscal policy in order to enforce 
compliance with the rules. It is therefore vital 
that Member States raise their own funding on 
the capital market and are compelled to present 
a convincing fiscal policy stance there. Potential 
risk premia are a strong incentive for fiscal dis -
cipline.
Over time, the fiscal rules have been repeatedly 
modified, and reforms are currently being de -
bated again. The aim should be to design the 
rules such that high debt ratios are brought 
down swiftly and a sound underlying position 
is achieved. And, indeed, the existing agree -
ments do reflect this intention: the key object -
ive is for the general government budget to be 
at least (close to) balanced in structural terms 
– in other words, after adjustment for cyclical 
and one- off effects. This is known as the medium- term objective or MTO. Where debt 
ratios are higher, the MTO should not exceed 
-0.5% of gross domestic product (GDP). If this 
MTO is met, debt ratios will usually also decline 
rapidly. Only if the debt ratio is significantly 
below 60% may a less ambitious MTO be set. 
If Member States fail to meet their MTO, the 
rule is that they should generally lower their 
structural deficit ratio by 0.5 percentage point 
per year. By doing so, they would in most cases 
deviate from their budgetary objective for no 
more than a limited transitional period.3
At present, however, the common rules often 
allow deviations from these basic quantitative 
requirements. The aim should be to strengthen 
the rules again. Although a certain degree of 
flexibility in the budget rules is appropriate and 
some measure of complexity is therefore un -
avoidable, the rules and their implementation 
still have to be transparent and predictable. 
This is becoming less and less the case with the 
European rules. Their application is the result of 
a process of political negotiation, and instead 
of binding quantitative rules, there are moving 
targets. Wide areas of scope for discretion 
mean that it is possible to excuse even persist -
ent gross failure to achieve the targets. It is, for 
instance, evidently possible to delay the reduc -
tion of even very high debt ratios again and 
again, while still remaining within the rules. In 
the meantime, neither the general public, nor 
politicians, nor academics can determine where 
the boundaries of a rule- consistent budgetary 
policy lie. Changes are necessary to reinforce 
the rules.4Sound public

3 In addition to the MTO, there is the reference value of 
3% of GDP for the (unadjusted) deficit and a figure of 60% 
for the debt ratio. These define the limit for what is known 
as the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact 
(SGP), which will not be discussed in greater detail here.

Yet strict rules are also criticised for being too 
restrictive. The argument is that they allow too 
little room for macroeconomic stabilisation and 
government investment. However, the rules do 
allow some leeway in this context. For instance, 
the rules are designed to ensure that automatic 
stabilisers can operate. In addition, exceptions 
are made for severe downturns. Leeway is also 
available where safety margins vis- à- vis the 
normal limits were established. Nor do the 
rules prevent the provision of an efficient public 
infrastructure. Shortcomings there are, in fact, 
more often the result of political priorities being 
set differently.
The underlying quantitative objectives of the 
European budget rules are reasonable and ap -
propriate. They safeguard sound government 
finances and allow sufficient room for man -
oeuvre. In that respect, they do not require an 
overhaul. Nonetheless, adjustments in individ -
ual areas could be examined without com -
promising the objective of sound public fi -
nances. The following areas will be looked at 
more closely: transferring fiscal surveillance to 
an independent institution, making the rules 
more transparent and more binding, introdu -
cing an expenditure rule, using control ac -
counts and rainy day funds and, finally, the 
question of the extent to which a special role 
could be given to government investment.
Selected reform areas
Transferring fiscal surveillance 
to an independent institution
Limits are only effective if compliance is moni -
tored and any breaches are reported and pen -
alised. Independent bodies are better suited to 
monitoring than institutions which are them -
selves part of the political process. Policy deci -
sions consistently give rise to strong incentives 
for excessive borrowing. The fiscal rules form a 
counterweight to such incentives, meaning 
that fiscal surveillance by bodies with close 
connections to the political sphere is disadvan -tageous.5 Consequently, the Member States 
agreed, with the Fiscal Compact, to establish 
independent national fiscal councils for the na -
tional level.
At the European level, by contrast, the Euro -
pean Commission is the key player in fiscal sur -
veillance. However, the Commission sees itself 
as a political institution and has other tasks be -
sides fiscal surveillance. It therefore weighs dif -
ferent policy objectives in the negotiation pro -
cess with the Member States. The very high 
degree of flexibility and the wide scope for dis -
cretion, in particular, mean that there is a risk 
of the objectives of the fiscal rules receding 
into the background.
To offset this, it would make sense to transfer 
fiscal surveillance to an independent institution. 
The competent authority should have a clear 
and narrow mandate and should not, in par -
ticular, pursue conflicting objectives. It should 
monitor public finances and assess fiscal plans. 
Its tasks would be to flag up actual and immi -
nent breaches of the rules, identify consolida -
tion needs and recommend procedural steps 
and sanctions. Its leeway for discretion should 
be strictly limited. On the basis of this prepar -
ation, the Council would, as is currently the 
case, take the decisions (e.g. determining the 
existence of an excessive deficit). However, the 
preparatory work and submissions would be 
less political. One could, for example, consider 
transferring the task of surveillance to the Euro -
pean Stability Mechanism and enhancing its in -
dependence in this area.6 By contrast, the re -
cently established European Fiscal Board fo -
cuses on the fiscal stance of the euro area and 
has very close ties to the European Commis -
sion.7Discussion on

Making the rules more trans -
parent and more binding
Fiscal rules should set concrete and transparent 
standards. This is the only way to ensure that 
fiscal developments are assessed and treated in 
a comparable manner over time and between 
Member States. The European rules do not 
meet these requirements.8 Therefore, clear re -
strictions should be placed on possible ways of 
deviating from the basic quantitative object -
ives. This relates to exemptions to the rules, as 
these are often neither clearly defined nor co -
herently justified. It is also problematic that as -
sessments are, in many instances, not rule-  
based and breaches are excused. The European 
Commission has very wide discretion and may 
give its approval even if quantitative require -
ments for all indicators are breached. The ex -
ceptions should be delimited strictly and clearly, 
and the relevant audit processes and compon -
ents should be defined in advance.
Any expenditure rules should 
be valid for one year at most 
and be tied to structural 
 objectives
A frequent proposal is that expenditure ceilings 
should feature more prominently in the rules.9 
This could, in fact, simplify the rules in some 
cases. However, expenditure rules are not easy 
in practice, and they also open up new loop -
holes. This would have to be taken into consid -
eration when designing the rules. It is key that 
the expenditure ceilings should be based on the 
underlying requirement in terms of the struc -
tural balance and should not undermine it. This 
is another reason why it is not advisable to de -
termine expenditure targets for multiple years.
Under the European rules, the MTO is defined 
as a structural balance. In addition, the amount 
by which the structural balance must be im -
proved is specified if a country is on the adjust -
ment path towards the MTO or must correct an 
excessive deficit. Structural balances (like all tar -get variables for budget rules) have specific in -
herent problems. They are nonetheless sensible 
anchor points for budget rules and should 
therefore be retained. Structural goals, for in -
stance, allow the automatic stabilisers to 
“breathe”. At the same time, the fiscal stance 
can be identified from the structural balances.
However, it is not always possible to unerringly 
achieve concrete structural balances. They may 
reflect unexpected developments, for instance. 
This applies, in particular, to revenues, or it 
might relate to a revised estimate of aggregate 
economic output, on which cyclical adjustment 
is based. If no safety margins were incorpor -
ated, such forecast errors could cause struc -
tural balance objectives to be missed, even 
though the budget plans have otherwise been 
implemented as planned. Where structural bal -
ance targets are to be met despite unexpected 
developments, implementation of the budget 
would have to be adjusted on an ad hoc basis. 
This could trigger a rather erratic fiscal path. In 
order to avoid this and take due account of 
such unintentional failures to achieve targets, 
complex corrections and special assessments 
are carried out at present. As a result, even ex -
perts can often find it nearly impossible to 
identify why a requirement is considered as 
having been met or missed.
An expenditure rule could simplify this assess -
ment process. For instance, corresponding 
maximum expenditure growth could be calcu -
lated for the structural balance to be achieved 
in the coming financial year.10 This ceiling Effective fiscal

8 A detailed and concrete description of the current rules’ 
high degree of complexity and of starting points for simpli -
fication may be found in Deutsche Bundesbank (2017b).
9 Proposals for an expenditure rule may be found, for ex -
ample, in European Commission (2017b); European Fiscal

(2019b).
10 A lot of proposals meanwhile envisage an expenditure 
rule that is not tied to a structural budgetary objective for 
the balance. The evaluation of such proposals will depend 
largely on what the setting of the expenditure ceiling is 
targeted at. In this, how quickly high debt ratios come 
down should be of particular importance. In many pro -
posals, however, this remains indeterminate.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

would then be the benchmark for assessing 
compliance with the rules in the year in ques -
tion. Deviations in other categories or revisions 
of the cyclical adjustment would not be rele -
vant but would be excused.
Nevertheless, an expenditure rule is not as sim -
ple as it seems at first sight. It is, for instance, 
likely to be difficult to implement and monitor 
such a rule in the individual government en -
tities of a strongly decentralised or federal 
Member State. Moreover, the expenditure ceil -
ing would have to be adjusted immediately if 
there were any measures on the revenue side: 
it would, for example, have to be reduced if 
taxes were subsequently lowered or sub-  
sectors of government with revenues and ex -
penditure were to be spun off.11 By contrast, 
subsequent tax increases could be used to fund 
additional expenditure.
For the expenditure rule to be effective, it is es -
sential that its limits be based on realistic fore -
casts. This is particularly true of profit- related 
taxes, which are especially hard to estimate, 
changes in tax legislation, and tax enforce -
ment. If revenue forecasts were too high, the 
permissible expenditure growth would be set 
too high. The objectives for the structural bal -
ance would then be exceeded. In order to ad -
dress false incentives, independent surveillance 
authorities should validate all forecasts and 
plans.
Moreover, it would be important for the max -
imum expenditure growth to be determined 
annually, i.e. only for the coming financial year. 
For the following financial year, it would then 
have to be newly derived from the current, 
rule- compliant structural balance or from the 
required improvement in the structural bal -
ance. By contrast, there are also some pro -
posals to set expenditure targets spanning a 
number of years, such as for one legislative 
period. This would be problematic, as it would 
potentially allow deficits to rise over this period 
without any countermeasures being taken. 
Economic activity being significantly weaker, in structural terms, than forecast might cause 
considerable problems over a period of several 
years, because the response to the new devel -
opment would be much too late.12
Control accounts an important 
addition
Budget objectives may be missed for a variety 
of reasons. Revenue forecasts may have been 
too high or too low, for example, or spending 
may have been higher or lower than the au -
thorised levels. This becomes critical when, as a 
result, debt increases over time more rapidly 
than the upper limits were designed to permit. 
It would therefore make sense to establish a 
control account for failures to achieve targets. 
This would record the amounts by which 
budget objectives have been exceeded or 
undershot.13 At the same time, a threshold for 
negative deviations from the target should be 
established to indicate when the cumulative 
rise in debt needs to be corrected. If the 
amounts recorded more or less cancel each 
other out over time, there would be no need 
for action. However, if the threshold were to be 
exceeded, the accumulated shortfall would 
have to be offset, in a rules- based manner, in 
the next few years.14 To this end, the require -
ments for the annual budget objective would Expenditure rule

11 This would also be the case, for instance, if usage fees 
were to be reduced (or collected less consistently) or if 
there were a cut in specific transfers linked to expenditure, 
say from the EU.
12 However, it is sensible to continue to embed the annual 
budget in a medium- term plan, since corrective action is 
taken on an annual basis.
13 In principle, the amounts of both positive and negative 
deviations from the MTO could be recorded in the control 
account. Alternatively, before the MTO is reached, only de -
viations from the adjustment path could be recorded.
14 The main objective of the control account would be to 
prevent an unintentional build- up of debt. In principle, 
however, if entries are positive on balance and above a 
threshold, budgetary objectives could be made less ambi -
tious for a while. That said, if this is at all possible, it should 
be on the basis of positive entries due to the MTO having 
previously been overachieved. By contrast, positive devi -
ations from the adjustment path alone – i.e. if the MTO has 
not yet been met – should not be used to justify higher 
levels of new borrowing. Generally speaking, surplus funds 
from overachieving the MTO could also be used as a rainy 
day fund. This will be discussed in the following section.Deutsche Bundesbank

have to be more ambitious for a certain period 
of time.15
There may be other reasons, too, for levels of 
debt being higher over time than is intended 
under the rules. This is especially true if the cyc -
lical adjustment method is not symmetrical and 
shows negative output gaps on balance. This 
cannot be ruled out for the method which the 
European Commission applies to the European 
rules. As a control measure, the identified cyc -
lical components could also be added up over 
time and any accumulated debt could be re -
paid.
Incorporating national rainy 
day funds into fiscal rules
The quantitative requirements of the European 
fiscal rules are sometimes criticised for being 
too narrow. Critics argue, for instance, that 
Member States should avoid having to carry 
out procyclical consolidation in the event of an 
unexpected structural downturn. There are also 
calls for greater scope to be given to an active 
stabilisation policy, for example.
So as not to undermine the necessarily strict 
limits by making numerous exceptions, on the 
one hand, and to allow flexibility on the other, 
national rainy day funds could be utilised within 
the framework of the rules. The basic idea be -
hind this type of fund is to build up a financial 
buffer in good times in order to prepare for 
“rainy days” ahead.16 This concept could be 
added to the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) 
without permitting additional debt. In other 
words, the targeted debt path under the MTO 
should, as a minimum, still be adhered to. There -
fore, it should be possible to credit the fund only 
in the amount by which the MTO is over -
achieved.17 This reserve could then allow room 
for manoeuvre. The limit of the regular MTO 
could be exceeded at a later date by drawing on 
these funds.18 As a result, the regular MTO would 
not be met in every single year but on average 
from the time the rainy day fund is established.19Such funds could, in principle, be used for dif -
ferent purposes. However, it would be highly 
advisable to stipulate provisions for the rule-  
based use of such funds in national legisla -
tion.20 Otherwise, funds could create new 
problems. For instance, they might be used to 
generate “political business cycles”. Moreover, 
large reserves might tempt policymakers to de -
cide on permanent additional spending or tax 
cuts that are financed (only) temporarily from 
the fund. Structural difficulties would initially 
be masked and any need for consolidation 
would be shifted to future governments. In 
order to avoid this, it would be advisable to set 
out specific requirements for the use of the re -
serve in the medium- term fiscal plans. There -
fore, the budget should be financed soundly 
and in full after the reserves have been used 
up. This would be ensured if the reserves were 
used to finance one- off expenses. This would 
also be the case if use of the buffers were 
tapered and had to be linked over time to spe -
cific matching fiscal consolidation measures. 
Provisions could also specify that the funds 
would, in general, be exclusively reserved for 
cushioning unexpected budgetary burdens.

15 As in Christofzik et al. (2018), pp. 18-19. For details on 
the debt brake, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2011, 2012); 
Federal Ministry of Finance (2015).
16 Almost all the US federal states have rainy day funds. 
See NASBO (2018).
17 The buffers in the rainy day fund do not necessarily in -
volve a build- up of assets. It is more of a notional account 
that adds up the amount by which the MTO has been over -
achieved.
18 The control accounts described above could be intro -
duced in parallel. At all events, only financial resources aris -
ing from overachieving the MTO should be added to the 
rainy day fund.
19 Government funds or reserves are unable to fulfil a simi -
lar purpose at present, since the MTO is fixed and the rules 
are linked to the public sector’s national accounts balance. 
This balance is not altered by additions to or withdrawals 
from a government fund. Internal transactions such as 
these have a neutral effect on the balance. This means that 
higher expenditure or tax cuts have a detrimental effect on 
the balance even if they are financed from a government 
fund. Unlike in the EU rules, Germany’s debt brake for cen -
tral government is based on net borrowing (not on the fis -
cal balance). Therefore, with a view to net borrowing, the 
refugee reserve allows central government to apply a simi -
lar principle to that of a rainy day fund. It does not change 
the deficit as per the national accounts, however.

expected need for fiscal adjustment further 
using resources from the funds. Although the 
current rules already make allowances should 
the structural budgetary position take an unex -
pected turn for the worse during the fiscal year 
in progress, the structural deterioration would 
need to be addressed over the next few years. 
Drawing on the funds would then allow the 
adjustments to be spread over a longer period 
of time.
Calls are sometimes made for the introduction 
of a European rainy day fund, which would be 
jointly financed. Its proponents often stress 
that additional borrowing opportunities and 
transfers between Member States are to be 
ruled out.21 However, the stated objectives of 
such a European fund could be achieved more 
effectively using national rainy day funds. For 
example, these do not require complicated 
“claw- back” mechanisms to avoid permanent 
transfers between Member States. In the cur -
rent regulatory framework of the monetary 
union, national solutions generally appear 
more appropriate given that the Member States 
are responsible for their own fiscal policy.
Special protection for invest -
ment in budget rules?
Golden rule under debate
In the debate about the budget rules, there are 
often also calls for borrowing to be allowed to 
finance government investment expenditure 
(known as the “golden rule”).22 The European 
fiscal rules make no provision for this.
On the one hand, supporters of a golden rule 
put forward the following arguments.
– Investment creates public assets. If add -
itional assets are financed through borrow -
ing, the debt level rises but the volume of 
net government assets remains unchanged. 
Seen in that light, the sustainability of public 
finances is not impaired, either.23– Capital stock formed through government 
investment is a major prerequisite for macro -
economic growth. Investment funds itself 
insofar as future government revenue is 
higher.
– A golden rule would enable the investment 
costs to be distributed more appropriately 
between generations. It would improve the 
balance between the costs and benefits of 
the additional capital stock – financing it 
solely from current revenue would place the 
burden on today’s taxpayers. Debt financing 
would allow the burden to be spread over a 
longer period corresponding to the assets’ 
useful life.
– If borrowing is not permitted, there is a risk 
that investment and the government capital 
stock will be too low. For instance, invest -
ment tends to be supported by stakeholders 
who are less assertive than those calling for 
different expenditure or tax cuts. Politically 
speaking, investment is therefore fairly dis -
pensable. If no final contractual agreement 
is in place, it is also relatively easy to curtail 
investment in practice (e.g. by postponing 
it). Should the need for consolidation arise, 
it is often the first thing to be reversed.
Others, meanwhile, point out the problems as -
sociated with a golden rule.

22 See, for example, Blanchard and Giavazzi (2004); Truger 
(2015); Melyn et al. (2016); Hüther (2019). For the pros and 
cons of taking investment into account, see Deutsche Bun -
desbank (1999, 2005); Expert Commission (2016); Euro -
pean Commission (2016); International Monetary Fund 
(2018a, 2018b).
23 The European budgetary rules are based on the national 
accounts balance. Investment in financial assets does not 
affect the balance. It is considered to be purely a shifting of 
financial assets, and debt financing is therefore permitted. 
Such financial transactions include, say, loans issued or pri -
vatisation proceeds. However, there exists a limit for finan -
cial transactions through the provisions for the debt ratio 
(60%): if financial assets are acquired through additional 
borrowing, gross debt goes up. This is the main factor for 
the Maastricht debt level.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
April 2019

in advanced economies; this means that 
there is no increase, on balance, in the cap -
ital stock. Loan financing would be justifi -
able, if at all, only if the capital stock were to 
rise, however. This would mean having to 
take write-  downs and other disposals into 
account.
– Problems can occur even if high levels of 
borrowing are balanced by a statistically 
high government capital stock. If there are 
doubts as to the sustainability of govern -
ment debt, it is often very difficult to mobil -
ise parts of the government capital stock in 
order to service the debt.24
– Whether or not government investment en -
courages growth depends on the specific in -
vestment projects. For example, net invest -
ment in what is already a very good infra -
structure is likely to boost growth to only a 
very limited extent. Under these conditions, 
if there is any need for consolidation, it may 
well make sense to cut investment expend -
iture first. Ultimately, investment clauses in 
the budget rules are just as unsuitable as 
generalised targets for government invest -
ment ratios as a means of ensuring appro -
priate and efficient government investment.
– Credit financing as an easy option for policy -
makers could increase the risk of over-  
investment and bad investments. Private in -
vestment might be crowded out, especially 
if aggregate capacity utilisation is high. 
There is also a danger that not enough ef -
fort would be made to check whether it 
would be better to obtain the correspond -
ing service from private investors.
– Without further analysis, it is not possible to 
tell whether the costs and benefits of public 
investment are shared fairly between the 
generations. Preferences for individual in -
vestments can change, too, while the debt 
incurred in order to finance them has to be 
serviced under any circumstances. In add -
ition, all other things being equal, a reduc -tion or stagnation of the capital stock would 
seem reasonable given a decreasing popula -
tion. A comprehensive review would ultim -
ately be needed to evaluate the intergenera -
tional distribution. For example, the pay- as- 
you- go statutory pension insurance scheme 
also has significant distributional effects in 
the context of demographic change. The 
golden rule does not take aspects such as 
these into account.
– There is a danger that, as a result of the 
golden rule, expenditure will be booked as 
investment where this was previously not 
the case. More generally, scope for bending 
and manipulating the rules would increase. 
The rules would also become more complex.
No golden rules at present
In Germany, central and state governments 
were subject to investment- related budgetary 
rules for many years. However, these proved in -
effective25 and were replaced by the debt 
brake.26 Thus far, the debt brake has been suc -
cessful in terms of reversing the decades- long 
trend of rising debt ratios. Although govern -
ment budgets have benefited from very favour -
able underlying conditions, the new, strict 
budget limits are likely to have played a key 
role in ensuring that relief from sources such as German debt 
brake a success 
thus far …
24 This applies, not least, to government investment in in -
tellectual property.
25 In Germany, rule- consistent borrowing was limited to 
the level of investment expenditure. Investment grants re -
ceived had to be deducted. This upper limit could be ex -
ceeded only in order to avert a disruption to overall eco -
nomic equilibrium. Among the points of criticism here were 
that investment was defined very broadly, no account was 
taken of write- downs and asset sales, the requirement had 
to be met only at the planning stage but not when imple -
menting the budget, burdens in special funds were not 
taken into account, and the exception was not defined in 
detail. On balance, these rules did not halt the depletion of 
government assets. The general government debt ratio 
rose to well over 60% without being accompanied by a 
matching increase in assets. See Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2005).
26 The debt brake under German Basic Law (Grundgesetz)  
will not apply fully to the state governments until 2020. 
Local governments can continue to finance investment 
through borrowing, but will have to furnish proof of their 
financial capacity.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
April 2019  
84

interest expenditure or positive labour market 
developments was also used to reduce deficits.
At the same time, Germany’s infrastructure is 
still rated as above average in comparative 
international surveys.27 Although it has short -
comings in various places, this can hardly be 
blamed on the new debt brake. Not least, there 
has been plenty of budgetary leeway even 
within these limits for some time now. Al -
though other priorities have largely been set for 
using such scope, such as appreciably higher 
social benefits, investment budgets have none -
theless been topped up as well. The fact that 
infrastructural weaknesses are being remedied 
fairly slowly is probably also due to planning 
and capacity constraints, complex legal require -
ments, and lengthy approval procedures.
All in all, introducing the debt brake was an 
important step for Germany. It again places 
sound public finances on a more reliable foot -
ing. The debt ratio will probably not reach the 
limit of 60% this year. However, the significant 
increase in demographic strains on the horizon 
means there are still major fiscal challenges 
ahead. This is one of the reasons why it is still 
advisable to apply the rules and, at the same 
time, ensure a very good public infrastructure 
within this framework.
The problems associated with a golden rule 
have meant that the European fiscal rules have 
largely shied away from introducing it, too. 
When the monetary union was established, 
placing a limit on government debt was seen 
as a priority. As part of the reform debate there 
are now occasional calls for investment to be 
considered more specifically in the form of a 
golden rule.
Requirements to limit risks of a potential 
golden rule and examples of design options  
There are substantial concerns about a golden 
rule. If, however, the outcome of the current 
European debate is that the potential benefits 
outweigh such concerns, the important thing would be to narrow down the risks to a min -
imum. This would mean bearing in mind four 
principles.
First, it should be ensured that high debt ratios 
do not decline more slowly if the rules are com -
plied with. In other words, the budgetary ob -
jective should not be less ambitious than the 
current MTO. An upper limit should therefore 
also be agreed for the additional deficits and 
debt resulting from investment (a “capped” 
golden rule). This cap would also limit the risks 
arising from undesirable interpretations and 
over- investment.28
Second, the investment to be recognised would 
have to be clearly and narrowly defined. One 
possibility would be government investment 
according to the national accounts. The na -
tional accounts provide an internationally har -
monised definition of investment based on the 
build- up of a government capital stock. This 
could at least limit the scope for defining the 
concept of investment.
Third, countries should be able to run up add -
itional debt only to the same extent that they 
accumulate additional assets. When calculating 
the deficit limit, the write-  downs according to 
the national accounts would have to be de -
ducted from gross investment – in other words, 
only net investment would be separated out.
Fourth, a symmetrical approach should be 
taken. If higher deficits were allowed in the case 
of positive net investment, then in the case of 
negative net investment – i.e. the consumption 
of government capital stocks – more ambitious 
budgetary objectives would have to be set.

(2018).
28 One of the things to be examined is whether only self- 
financed net investment is counted towards this limit. This 
would prevent, say, investment projects co- financed by the 
EU permitting a higher level of national debt.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
April 2019

limits for the MTO. The existing rules allow a 
structural deficit of up to 0.5% of GDP pro -
vided that the debt ratio is not “significantly 
below 60%”.29 What counts as “significant” 
has not yet been quantified. Nonetheless, a 
debt ratio of below 50% could, as a rule, be 
considered to be an appropriate, quite sound 
basis for moderately easing the MTO.
Therefore, for debt ratios above 50% (i.e. not 
significantly below 60%), the structural deficit 
could be as high as net investment in the na -
tional accounts – but no greater than 0.5% of 
GDP . The MTO ceiling would thus continue to 
apply, but only if net investment amounted to 
at least 0.5% of GDP . If net investment were 
between 0% and 0.5% of GDP , deficits of the 
same amounts could be permitted. If net in -
vestment were negative, the government 
would need to run surpluses.
For debt ratios significantly below 60%, under 
the current rules, a structural deficit ratio that is 
higher by 0.5 percentage point can be set as the 
MTO, thus reaching up to 1%. In line with the 
above- described approach, for debt ratios below 
50% deficits of at most 1% of GDP would be 
permissible only if net investment amounts to at 
least 0.5% of GDP . Given relatively sound pos -
itions such as these, consideration might, under 
certain circumstances, be given to adding the 
amount of net investment to the 1% limit – 
again up to a maximum of 0.5% of GDP . In other 
words, a structural deficit ratio of up to 1.5% 
would be allowed as long as net investment is at 
least 0.5% of GDP . If net investment is lower 
than that, more ambitious fiscal targets would 
have to be met. The debt ratio would potentially 
drop less significantly below 50%. However, very 
low debt ratios thanks to persistently balanced 
budgets would still be possible, because the 
MTO is not a target figure but an upper limit.
Investment could also be factored into the ad -
justment path towards the MTO. For example, 
provision could be made for falling investment 
expenditure being regarded as a contribution 
to consolidation only if net investment still comes to at least 0.5% of GDP . If net invest -
ment is lower than this, consolidation would 
have to be accomplished entirely through other 
expenditure categories or through revenue.30
If investment expenditure is taken into account 
by the rules, fiscal surveillance would also have 
to track the actual level of investment. Invest -
ment expenditure being lower ex post (without 
lower deficits) would constitute a breach.
This sample design of a strict capped golden 
rule would ensure that very high and high debt 
ratios decline swiftly given adherence to the 
rules. Due account would be taken of the risk 
that high debt ratios pose to monetary union. 
Only if debt ratios were significantly below the 
60% threshold could thought be given to a 
somewhat greater easing of the MTO based on 
positive net investment.
At the same time, this would counteract incen -
tives to make excessive cuts to investment in 
order to comply with the European fiscal rules. 
The deficit targets would become more ambi -
tious, the further net investment falls below 
0.5% of GDP . This would mean that countries 
would be unable to comply with the fiscal rules 
by reducing investment expenditure to below 
0.5% of GDP . Even where there is a need for 
structural adjustment, government investment 
would, at most, face limited consolidation 
pressure. This pressure would then arise in 
other areas. If the amount of net investment 
that can be counted were capped at 0.5% of 
GDP , any misguided incentives would be 
limited, thus mitigating the risks of inefficient 
over- investment or improper structures. This 
would not make higher government net invest -
ment impossible – it would just not be permis -
sible for it to be financed by additional borrow -

ies. Overall, this would slow down debt reduction, but only

of GDP , a figure of 0% could also be set.Deutsche Bundesbank

Conclusion
The way in which the European fiscal rules 
have evolved is unsatisfactory, and the way in 
which they are being applied has become 
somewhat incomprehensible. Even during the 
favourable times of the past few years, very 
high debt ratios, in particular, barely declined in 
many cases. Fiscal surveillance evidently failed 
to induce further steps towards consolidation, 
and even instances of structural loosening 
went unpunished. There is a need for reform. 
The medium- term objective of the structurally 
(close to) balanced budget should be more 
binding on fiscal policymakers. This would en -
sure that high debt ratios fall swiftly. Numerous 
exceptions and discretionary scope should 
therefore be dispensed with.
Limits must be implemented strictly. National 
parliaments retain responsibility for setting fis -
cal policy, but the pressure to adopt a sound 
stance could be increased. Progress in this di -
rection could be expected if fiscal surveillance 
were to be transferred to a clearly focused in -
dependent institution. If an expenditure rule 
were to be introduced, the structural fiscal bal -
ance should remain the key reference point 
and guidepost. It could be converted into an 
expenditure ceiling which would have to be 
complied with in the budget planning and exe -
cution phases. The expenditure ceiling would 
be set only for the year ahead, not for multiple 
years. For each subsequent fiscal year, it would 
be newly derived from the current, rule-  
compliant structural balance or the required 
improvement in the structural balance.
National rainy day funds could create flexibility 
for fiscal policymakers within the framework of 
the rules, even if quantitative objectives were 
more stringent. For this to work, such funds 
would have to be better integrated into the fis -
cal rules. The funds would be stocked in ad -
vance from overachieving the medium- term 
objective (MTO) and should not create add -
itional scope for borrowing. It would be advis -
able to stipulate solely rule- based utilisation of the funds, as a way of cushioning the impact of 
unexpected budget burdens, in particular. This 
would not require complex European mechan -
isms.
Swiftly reducing high debt ratios should be a 
key objective of the fiscal rules. This should also 
be at the heart of deliberations on any reforms. 
This also holds true if the rules were geared, 
say, to greater protection for government in -
vestment. Such golden rules have considerable 
inherent problems and risks, and have often 
proved unsuccessful in the past. If the Euro -
pean rulebook moves in this direction nonethe -
less, it has to be ensured that the rules do not 
make compromises on the objective of rapidly 
declining high debt ratios. They should refer to 
narrowly defined net investment. In the event 
of capital depletion (i.e. negative net invest -
ment), a more ambitious fiscal position than at 
present would be called for. For debt ratios sig -
nificantly below 60%, positive net investment 
could permit limited additional deficits.
Each Member State in the monetary union is 
responsible for its own fiscal policy and hence 
must also answer for its repercussions. Quite 
apart from the specific fiscal rules, each Mem -
ber State decides whether or not to comply 
with the joint agreements and uphold them. 
The European level cannot intervene in fiscal 
policy to ensure that limits are complied with or 
debts serviced. This means that the rejection of 
joint liability along with individually liable finan -
cing on the capital market have to remain key 
elements of the fiscal framework in monetary 
union. Thus, it remains necessary for each 
Member State to make sure that no doubts 
arise on the financial markets as to the ser -
vicing of government debt. Potentially increas -
ing risk premia still constitute a material incen -
tive to run a sound fiscal policy. Targeted fiscal 
rules that are perceived to be binding can play 
a crucial role in creating and maintaining trust. 
But to do so, they have to be implemented in 
an appropriate manner, and compliance must 
be monitored transparently and sanctioned if 
and when required.There is a need

Germany’s debt brake: 
 surveillance by the Stability Council
Since 2016, Germany’s debt brake has limited the Federal Government’s structural net borrowing 
to 0.35% of gross domestic product (GDP). From 2020, Germany’s federal states will be generally 
forbidden from taking on new debt. The federal states have implemented this provision of the 
Basic Law in very different ways thus far. The key point is that debt ultimately remains limited in 
future. Furthermore, the debt brake also aims to ensure compliance with European budgetary 
rules for general government.
Comprehensive and transparent fiscal surveillance is a key factor in the binding force of budget -
ary rules. In Germany, the Stability Council is to carry out this surveillance, i.e. chiefly the Federal 
Minister of Finance and the state ministers of finance. From 2020, the Stability Council will also 
review the extent to which central government and the individual state governments are adhering 
to their debt brakes. In this context, the budgets are to be assessed against uniform criteria and 
the results of these assessments are to be published. At the same time, the Stability Council is 
tasked with ensuring that there are no conflicts with European budgetary rules. These are linked 
not to budgetary data, but to the budget balance according to the national accounts. Overall, 
the intention is to set up a new early warning system for breaches of budgetary rules. As the Sta -
bility Council is not an independent supervisory authority, a transparent and goal- oriented surveil -
lance procedure is essential.
In December 2018, the Stability Council finalised its review criteria for monitoring the debt brakes. 
However, it is uncertain whether it will always be able to detect potential clashes with European 
budgetary rules, especially as deficits cannot be derived within the relevant definition. Moreover, 
it is not required that the agreed indicators be defined in an entirely harmonised manner, which 
makes it more difficult to draw comparisons between federal states. Together with the complex 
steps in the procedure, this also has an impact on transparency. Furthermore, it is intended that 
the results of the review will be published only with the consent of the relevant government entity.
Overall, the review process appears to be inadequate for assessing and comparing the respective 
financial situations and outlooks. It is difficult to ascertain whether a clash with the general gov -
ernment deficit ceiling is on the horizon. In order to gain a comprehensive and meaningful pic -
ture, it would be advisable, amongst other things, to use harmonised indicators that are closely 
oriented towards the rules of the national accounts. Alongside the off- budget entities that are to 
be taken into account, this also affects the delineation of deficit- relevant events. In any case, the 
results and their derivations should be made available to the public in full.Deutsche Bundesbank

Current fiscal surveillance 
by the Stability Council
The debt brake was adopted in 2009 and will 
also apply to the federal states from 2020. Art -
icle 109(3) of the Basic Law sets out general 
rules for the debt brakes. The core point is that 
net borrowing is forbidden with only few ex -
ceptions. For the Federal Government, Article 
115 stipulates additional key points that include 
repayment obligations if the rules have been 
breached. The federal states are requested to 
enshrine their debt brakes in state rules. Consti -
tutional courts can review whether the require -
ments have been met. However, above and 
beyond this, it is crucial that unwelcome devel -
opments are detected and counteracted in 
good time. For this to happen, budgetary situ -
ations and developments must be assessed as 
comprehensively and – not least for the benefit of the general public – as transparently as pos -
sible.
The Stability Council was created alongside the 
debt brake with the aim of monitoring German 
public finances. Instead of an independent body, the Federal and state finance ministers 
who sit on the Stability Council are responsible for their own supervision. Thus far, the Stability Council has reviewed whether the Federal Gov -
ernment or the individual states are at risk of a budgetary emergency. Furthermore, it assesses whether the federal states receiving consolida-
tion assistance –  Berlin, Bremen, Saarland, 
Saxony-  Anhalt and Schleswig-  Holstein  – are 
adhering to their agreed deficit reduction 
paths. It also checks compliance with the gen-eral government deficit ceiling according to EU rules and, if necessary, makes proposals for cor -
rective action. In order to take account of the 
European Fiscal Compact, the Stability Council 
is assisted by an independent advisory board.1 
This advisory board publishes its evaluations of the Stability Council’s projections.
Harmonised, meaningful and up-  to-  date fig-
ures on budgetary situations and prospects are 
decisive for effective fiscal surveillance. Trans -parency in this regard also makes it easier for 
the general public to work towards sound gov -
ernment finances.2 This is especially important 
if those responsible for the budgets are also 
responsible for their own supervision. With this 
in mind, the current fiscal surveillance by the 
Stability Council exhibits considerable weak -
nesses. One example of these is the agreed in -
dicator system for emerging budgetary emer -
gencies.3 In this context, high alert thresholds 
and the major importance attributed to the 
sluggish debt level prevent early warning sig-
nals that would facilitate gentler countermeas -
ures. Furthermore, government entities that are 
off the core budget are not included. In add -
ition, relatively old planned budget figures are 
used instead of current forecast figures in some cases.
Future surveillance  
of the debt brakes
Review based on the relevant requirements
In December 2018, the Stability Council de -
cided to monitor the debt brakes using a new, 
two- step pr ocess from 2020.4 In the first step 
of this process, the Stability Council conducts 
its review based on the criteria of the debt 
brake for the Federal Government or for the 
relevant federal state. The specific details of 
this step in the review process have not been 
made public.
The majority of the federal state debt brakes 
aim, at the very least, to balance the cyclically 
adjusted budget outturn. In this regard, how -
ever, the rules differ in a number of areas. This 
applies not only to the variety of procedures 
used for cyclical adjustment.5 Shifts in financial Debt brake

assets (financial transactions) that do not affect 
the balance are also defined in different ways. 
Furthermore, the target variables differ. For the 
most part, they are not closely oriented to -
wards the budget balance in the national ac -
counts, which is essential to the general gov -
ernment deficit ceiling. In addition, withdraw -
als from and payments into reserves are often 
treated as revenue and expenditure, respect -
ively. This means that the reported result 
changes even though the overall financial situ -
ation of the relevant government entity has re -
mained the same.6
Overall, there are concerns that these reviews 
of the respective debt brakes will not be espe -
cially beneficial.7 The information provided by 
each subject regarding its planned budget fig -
ures is expected to be highly difficult to verify 
and interpret in some cases. This applies espe -
cially to federal states that update their target 
figures on a comparatively infrequent basis. 
Up- to- date and transparent forecasts would be 
vital for effective supervision, however. It could 
also be helpful for the Stability Council to ana -
lyse any discrepancies between the results and 
the previously submitted forecasts.
Harmonised review with 
 regard to European 
 requirements
The review of the federal state debt brakes is 
important. However, it does not allow for 
meaningful comparisons between states. For 
this to be possible, there need to be uniformly 
defined budgetary indicators that also take ac -
count of government entities that are formally 
off the budget. The statutory provisions indi -
cate that the second step in the review process 
should fulfil these requirements (see the adja -
cent overview). In addition, it appears that the Review accord -
ing to relevant 
rules presum -
ably of little 
benefit

European requirements are intended to be the 
key criteria. In this context, the national ac -
counts are the main reference framework, 
which should then also govern harmonised sur -
veillance by the Stability Council. This is signifi -
cant with regard to two aspects in particular: 
first, in terms of delineating sectors, i.e. select -
ing the off- budget entities that are to be taken 
into account (all off- budget entities); second, in 
terms of how budgetary events are specifically 
recorded, especially which transactions are to 
be recognised as being neutral to the balance.
The Stability Council agreed upon a number of 
anchor points for its harmonised review, which 
are described in greater detail below. The fol -
lowing have been determined:
– the underlying target variable;
– the reporting requirements regarding off-  
budget entities in the government sector;
– the events to be defined as financial trans -
actions;
– the determination of cyclical effects.
In addition, the Stability Council decided on a 
threshold value which, if exceeded, will be 
used as an early warning signal for federal state 
budgets that deviate from a structural balance.
The derivations and outcomes for a federal 
state are to be published only with that state’s 
consent. However, it is not clear as to why the 
information should be withheld from the gen -
eral public: transparency towards the public is 
an important component of budgetary surveil -
lance. This is all the more applicable in this case 
as the members of the Stability Council are es -
sentially responsible for their own government 
budgets and, to this extent, cannot constitute 
an independent surveillance authority. Trans -
parency would also facilitate broader public 
discourse on budgetary trends – both for indi -
vidual entities as well as when drawing com -
parisons between federal states.The foreseeable differences in the quality of the 
data are also likely to have a negative impact 
on transparency as well as comparability. For 
example, planned budget figures may also be 
submitted for the budget assessment for the 
current and following year. However, planned 
budget figures may, for instance, include exten -
sive global cuts in expenditure or increases in 
revenue in order to avoid revealing any 
breaches of the rules. To the extent that the 
budgetary relief does not materialise, the re -
quirements would then be unfulfilled without 
any prior warning signal. Moreover, the 
planned budget figures of different federal 
states are typically based on different data vin -
tages. This is especially important if different 
tax estimates are used as the basis or if changes 
in tax legislation that were only adopted at a 
later point in time are taken into account in dif -
ferent ways. For a meaningful comparison, the 
measures included but not yet adopted would 
need to be reported transparently including the 
relevant amounts. Measures that have since 
been adopted but not yet taken into account 
would likewise need to be reported with the 
relevant amounts. In general terms, a compari -
son of current forecasts of budgetary trends 
against the upper limit would be objectively 
warranted. In order to ensure the robustness of 
the estimates, regular ex  post checks by the 
Stability Council would be worth considering.
Net borrowing as target variable
The Stability Council specified that net borrow -
ing should be the harmonised target variable 
for surveillance. Central government’s debt 
brake is also based on this variable, as are the 
debt brakes of most federal state governments. 
It is, however, of limited use for monitoring the 
structural national accounts deficits, which are 
bound by the European rules. This is because 
resorting to (the currently high) reserves would 
reduce net borrowing in the budget, but not in 
the national accounts balance, as withdrawals 
from the reserves merely represent a regroup -Assessment

ing within the government sector.8 At any rate, 
changes in the reserves must be stated for the 
harmonised review. If the data are published, 
the (planned and actual) national accounts bal -
ances can be inferred to this extent.
Inclusion of off- budget entities
If the relevant deficits are to be calculated, all 
government entities must be included in full in 
surveillance. However, the Stability Council in -
cludes dependent off- budget entities9 along -
side core budgets only if they received their 
own borrowing authorisations after 2011. As 
these entities will usually be banned from net 
new borrowing going forward, they are likely 
to play a negligible role, at least in the longer 
term. Meanwhile, the excluded off- budget en -
tities with no borrowing authorisation, into 
which surpluses were ploughed in recent years, 
could become significant. The reserves formed 
there may be used to reduce the net borrowing 
relevant to the debt brake. However, like with -
drawals from reserves, resorting to such re -
serves does not lower the deficit in the national 
accounts relevant to the European rules. Unlike 
withdrawals from reserves, such transactions 
are not evident from the specified data: neither 
financial flows between the core budget and 
these off- budget entities nor the planned fiscal 
balances for these special funds need to be re -
ported.
Adjusting budget balances for financial 
transactions
For the harmonised review, net borrowing is 
adjusted for the financial transactions “new 
borrowing and repayments” as well as “acqui -
sitions and sales of participating interests”. This 
is in line with the rules specified in most federal 
states’ debt brakes. In a departure from the 
current procedure (in the surveillance of federal 
states receiving consolidation assistance), ex -
penditure on calls on guarantees is in future to 
be recognised in the balance. In this respect, 
notable progress has been made.However, in other instances, the definition of 
financial transactions continues to differ con -
siderably from the European (national accounts) 
definition. For instance, capital injections are 
always recognised as financial transactions, 
meaning that they are not included in the rele -
vant budget balance. This is not the case in the 
national accounts, however, if the capital injec -
tion is not used to acquire recoverable assets. 
If, for example, losses incurred by public trans -
port companies are covered, a deficit- increasing 
capital transfer is booked there. Unlike under 
the EU framework, non- cash transactions with 
financial assets are also generally disregarded. 
For instance, the harmonised review ignores 
debt relief and debt assumption although they 
lead to a deterioration of the asset position and 
weigh on the national accounts balance. Har -
monised fiscal surveillance by the Stability 
Council ought to follow the national accounts 
approach, also in order to produce a realistic 
picture of the budgetary situation. At the very 
least, deviations from reporting pursuant to the 
national accounts should be listed, which is not 
something that the Stability Council requires, 
however.10
Budgetary interest expenditure should likewise 
be adjusted for financial transactions in order 
to bring the figures more into line with the 
European accounting rules. This is true both of 
derivatives transactions and discounts and pre -
miums when issuing debt instruments. How -
ever, under the harmonised review, no such 
correction is made, nor is the relevant informa -
tion reported.Structural

Cyclical adjustment11
According to Section 5a of the Stability Council 
Act, harmonised surveillance should include a 
uniform cyclical adjustment procedure. Accord -
ing to the Stability Council decision, central 
government is to apply its customary proced -
ure, which is based on the EU approach. The 
overall review will therefore cause no alarm for 
central government as long as it adheres to its 
own rules. Several federal states obviously 
wanted their valuations to be closely based on 
their own rules. For instance, under the har -
monised procedure, the states were granted 
options in terms of the cyclical adjustment pro -
cedure. A federal state may, for example, opt 
for the adjustment method used to monitor 
the federal states receiving consolidation assis -
tance. The cyclical effects recognised can there -
fore deviate substantially from what is recog -
nised under the central government procedure. 
The reason is that, under the consolidation as -
sistance procedure, forecast errors are attrib -
uted solely to cyclical factors (where the budget 
spans two years, this may even be the case 
across several years). Several federal states’ 
debt brakes allow net borrowing only when 
economic performance is extremely weak and 
only subsequently demand that such debt be 
repaid during an economic boom. These states 
have the option of not being flagged if they do 
not plan to repay debt despite the statistics in -
dicating favourable cyclical factors. For this to 
be the case, a specific control account must 
show no increase in debt since the debt brake 
was implemented. Under this option, the har -
monised method consequently also allows 
higher cyclical tax revenue to be spent rather 
than sending an alarm signal. In sum, all these 
options considerably limit both comparability 
and suitability as a tool for monitoring compli -
ance with EU regulations. The results after cyc -
lical adjustment as per the EU procedure should 
be stated at least as a memo item.Tolerance
Despite the leeway, outlined above, that the 
federal states have to mask budgetary short -
falls, the Stability Council does not wish to send 
an alarm signal every time it identifies structural 
new borrowing. In fact, a tolerance (“compen -
sation component”) of 0.15% of gross domes -
tic product was agreed for the state govern -
ments as a whole. The amount is distributed 
across the federal states based on their popula -
tion. For North Rhine-  Westphalia, for instance, 
tolerated structural net new borrowing works 
out to just over €1 billion, while the figure for 
Hesse is almost €½ billion. This is justified 
mainly by specific issues in local government 
financial  equalisation schemes. For instance, 
delays in final settlement are not reflected in 
cyclical adjustment. However, it would be pos -
sible to properly neutralise the effects through 
loans. The loosening of the actual budget tar -
get agreed in the form of the compensation 
component is therefore not convincing.
The additional compensation component for 
above- average population growth agreed by 
the Stability Council is a sensible idea. Add -
itional tax revenue as a result of population 
growth is, in the first instance, classified as cyc -
lical, for instance when conducting cyclical ad -
justment using the consolidation assistance 
procedure. This means that it may not be used 
to cover additional expenditure. It should, 
however, be immediately available to cover the 
additional needs resulting from population 
growth. For city states, a population growth-  
related premium on the compensation com -
ponent was agreed for this purpose. It is not 
logical why this should apply only to city states 
and why there should be no equivalent dis -
counts for below- average population growth.
The debt brake does not apply to local govern -
ment. However, the local government level is 
automatically included for city states. For this Federal states 
have extensive 
options despite 
calls for har -
monised cyclical 
adjustmentCompensation

reason, city states are, according to the Stabil -
ity Council decision, to receive a premium on 
the new borrowing limit if local government 
debt in the non- city states has risen. This rule is 
not symmetrical, however, as a drop in local 
government debt in the non- city states does 
not mean higher requirements for city states. It 
would, in fact, be better for higher local gov -
ernment deficits in the non- city states to be 
recognised there than for them to justify add -
itional leeway for city states. Ultimately, the im -
pression conveyed is that the premiums aim to 
ease the budget rules for the already very 
highly indebted city states.
Conclusions
In December 2018, the Stability Council de -
cided how it would meet its legal mandate to 
monitor the debt brakes from 2020 onwards. 
This task is rendered more difficult by the fact 
that the federal states look set to have very dif -
ferent debt brake rules. The surveillance of the 
federal state- specific borrowing limits planned 
in the first stage of the review is ultimately not 
likely to provide enough information value. In 
particular, it will not allow comparisons be -
tween the individual states.
Though a more uniform review checklist was 
agreed for a second review step, it is fairly non- 
transparent and, moreover, the outcome is not 
required to be published for every federal state. 
Ultimately, therefore, it too fails to ensure that 
comprehensive comparisons can be made. This 
appears to be a major shortcoming, in particu -
lar as no independent body is tasked with 
monitoring the debt brakes. Surveillance is 
therefore likely to be non- transparent for the 
public.
The standardised review checklist has a number 
of shortcomings. In particular, it is not possible 
to adequately assess whether the European 
rules are set to be breached. For instance, there 
is no way of deriving structural deficits on the 
basis of these rules. This is because the debt brake surveillance rules do not consistently fol -
low the classification requirements for transac -
tions pursuant to the national accounts, which 
are key for the European budget rules. Unlike 
in the national accounts, some important off-  
budget entities at the state level are not cap -
tured, either. Various options for cyclical adjust -
ment further severely limit comparability among 
federal states. On top of that, there is no re -
quirement to update budget estimates for the 
budget years, meaning that these may be 
based on very different data vintages. Targeted 
remedial action would be recommendable in 
relation to these issues.
A general government structural deficit above 
the European limit may also emanate from the 
local government level. This level was left out 
of the debt brake on account of data and plan -
ning problems.12 However, the Federal Govern -
ment will continue to present an estimate for 
local authorities in aggregate in order to be 
able to calculate a general government deficit. 
It would have been desirable in this context for 
the federal states to forecast the financial re -
sults of their local governments. This could im -
prove the aggregate Federal Government fore -
cast, as the federal states have an information 
advantage. For instance, they manage import -
ant municipal tasks as well as large- scale trans -
fers to their local governments. Furthermore, 
they set out, and are able to ensure compliance 
with, budget rules for local government. In 
addition, the federal states are likely to have to 
shoulder at least some of the burden of over -
indebted local governments. Overall, it would 
therefore be appropriate for developments in 
local government finances to be included in fis -
cal surveillance at the federal state level.
In addition, the European budget rules correct 
for any larger one-  off effects that could mask 
the underlying trend. Last year saw quite a 
number of such special effects at the federal 
state level: Lower Saxony and Bavaria were 
paid high fines by automobile producers, Ham -Compensatory

to pay for losses on portfolios of HSH Nord -
bank. To be able to compare budgets without 
such distortions, any major one- off effects 
would have to be listed with the respective fig -
ures.
Overall, the agreed review criteria do not guar -
antee transparent and meaningful fiscal surveil -
lance. Over time, these criteria are to be re -
viewed and modified as appropriate. It would 
be important to achieve progress in the afore -mentioned areas – not least in order to resolve 
the challenges presented by not having an in -
dependent surveillance authority. In any case, 
the federal states should make public the key 
data they calculate. These data should allow 
the public to correctly evaluate developments 
in the individual federal states. Sound public 
finances  depend, not least, on public backing, 
which in turn requires comprehensive and 
transparent information on financial develop -
ments.Looking ahead,
