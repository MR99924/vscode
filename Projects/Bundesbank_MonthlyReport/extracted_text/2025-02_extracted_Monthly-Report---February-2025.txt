Overview
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 61 Global economy and international financial markets
1.1 Global economy faces new challenges
The global economy expanded moderately again in the final quarter of 2024.  This 
expansion varied across regions. Economic activity remained buoyant in the United 
States, and in China it strengthened somewhat due to government stimulus measures 
and strong exports. By contrast, economic output in the euro area rose only slightly. 
This was also due to the elimination of one-off effects that had supported growth in the 
third quarter, such as the Olympic Games in Paris. 
The regional dichotomy in industrial activity also continued in the fourth quarter.  
Globally, industrial output is likely to have expanded quite substantially in the final 
quarter of 2024. However, output growth continued to be driven primarily by emerging 
market economies. In the advanced economies, industrial activity remained weak. 
Exports of goods also only picked up in the group of emerging market economies. 
Expectations of higher  import tariffs probably contributed here. US
The tighter US trade policy stance could weigh heavily on world trade and global 
activity.  Newly elected  President Trump intensified his tariff threats against Canada US
and Mexico, the United States’ main trading partners.  import tariffs on China have US
already been raised, although so far not nearly by as much as was promised before the 
presidential election. Recently, the  administration has also adopted additional tariffs US
on all imports of steel and aluminium and announced broad-based tariff increases 
against many of its trade partners. Actions of this kind could provoke retaliatory 
measures from affected countries. Should that occur, the United States has announced 
that it will respond with further tariff steps. This could lead to serious trade conflicts. 
Against this backdrop, trade policy uncertainty rose considerably worldwide. The 
heightened uncertainty alone could already be dampening global economic activity. 

Overview
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 71.2 The disinflation process has made little progress recently
Energy commodity prices temporarily picked up markedly.  Continued production 
cuts by  and its partners, as well as new  sanctions against the Russian oil OPEC US
sector, pushed up oil prices at the beginning of 2025. Since then, however, oil prices 
have again declined markedly. The new  administration’s appeals to expand oil US
production in the United States and in  countries probably played a major role OPEC
here. At the same time, emerging trade policy conflicts are likely to worsen prospects 
for global oil demand. Against this backdrop, the International Energy Agency currently 
expects global oil markets to be well supplied in 2025. 
The disinflation process has made little progress recently.  In the group of advanced 
economies, the increase in consumer prices rose to 2.9 % within one year in 
January 2025, compared with 2.4 % in October 2024. This was mainly due to base 
effects and the recent rise in energy prices. The core rate excluding energy and food 
remained stable at 3.1 % over the same period. Inflationary pressure remained 
stubbornly high, particularly in the services sector.

Overview
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 82 Financial market environment
2.1 Long-term interest rates rise significantly
Financial markets were shaped by considerably higher long-term interest rates, an 
advancing disinflation process in the euro area and dwindling expectations of key 
interest rate cuts, especially in the United States.  Market participants revised their 
expectations regarding key interest rates in the euro area for 2025 slightly upwards. 
However, they continue to expect money market rates to fall noticeably and the degree 
of monetary policy restriction to ease as the year goes on. Surveys as well as market 
data point to the inflation target being reached in the medium term. Expectations of 
interest rate cuts in connection with  monetary policy fell much more sharply. The US
disinflation process has turned out to be comparatively slow in this instance. More 
recently, market participants were expecting the  to make only one further interest Fed
rate cut in 2025. 
Yields on ten-year US Treasuries – and thus yields worldwide – rose sharply on 
balance.  Factors contributing to this included growing expectations of inflation in the 
United States, unexpectedly robust growth signals from the  economy, and expected US
fiscal pressures. Concerns as to whether tariffs or the more restrictive immigration 
policy could hamper  growth have thus far receded. Investors also expect, at least in US
the short term, growth stimuli from  fiscal policy, which is likely to result in a sharp US
increase in its debt levels in relation to  The rise was ultimately caused by an GDP .
unusually high increase in term premia. This not only reflected the gradually growing 
optimism regarding the  economy, but also renewed uncertainty surrounding infla-US

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 9tion developments in the United States and the future path of key interest rates. The 
rise in term premia also spread to the yields of ten-year federal bonds (Bunds) and 
European government bonds overall. However, given that expectations regarding 
monetary policy interest rates were revised upwards more significantly for the United 
States than for the euro area, the interest rate differential between the euro area and 
the United States widened noticeably. This was the decisive factor in the euro depreciat-
ing significantly against the  dollar. Overall, the euro was also effectively down on US
the currencies of 18 trading partners in the reporting period, with this likely being more 
a reflection of a subdued economic picture.
2.2 Rising equity market prices
With investors’ appetite for risk increasing and the US economy posting unexpect-
edly positive figures, prices in the international equity markets rose noticeably.  On 
balance, the increased risk appetite helped drive up valuations, in particular for  US
equities. Particularly in anticipation of the new  administration’s relaxation of regula-   US
tions for the financial industry, investors expected banks’ high interest margins to 
persist for some time. The value of bank equities rose significantly as a result.

Overview
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 103 Monetary policy and banking business
3.1  Governing Council lowers key interest rates two more timesECB
At its monetary policy meetings in December 2024 and January 2025, the ECB 
Governing Council adopted two further interest rate cuts.  The deposit facility 
rate – the rate though which the Governing Council steers the monetary policy 
stance – was lowered by 25 basis points twice, reaching 2.75 %. One of the Governing 
Council’s rationales for the policy rate cuts was that the disinflation process was well on 
track. Inflation has largely continued to develop broadly in line with the December 
projections. The  Governing Council expects euro area inflation to return to the 2 % ECB
medium-term target in the course of this year. 
In December, the ECB Governing Council adjusted its communication, removing 
earlier references to restrictive monetary policy.  It will follow a data-dependent and 
meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance. 
The Governing Council’s interest rate decisions will be based on its assessment of the 
inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of 
underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The Governing 
Council is not pre-committing to a particular rate path.
3.2 Upward trend in euro area lending growth continues
The rebound in monetary growth continued in the fourth quarter of 2024; lending is 
increasingly showing signs of recovery.  Inflows into the broad monetary aggregate
 stabilised at a high level in the last quarter of 2024; the annual growth rate of  M3 M3
rose to 3.5 % at the end of December 2024. Growth in the money supply was bolstered 
in particular by a further decline in the opportunity costs of holding money and by 
economic uncertainties which boosted the appeal of liquid assets. On the counterpart 
side, banks’ lending to domestic non-banks replaced inflows from abroad as the main 
factor driving monetary growth, with the upward trend in loans to households gaining 
in strength. Furthermore, loans to non-financial corporations showed some signs of

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 11recovery as well, though probably only a gradual one given the subdued growth 
prospects for the euro area. Banks surveyed in the Bank Lending Survey  reported ( )BLS
a marginal uptick in demand for loans to enterprises in the fourth quarter of 2024. 

Overview
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 124 German economy
4.1 Economic output declined in the fourth quarter
German economic output fell surprisingly significantly in the fourth quarter of 2024.  
According to the flash estimate of the Federal Statistical Office, seasonally adjusted real 
gross domestic product  recorded a quarter-on-quarter decline of 0.2 %. This ( ) GDP
represents a slight downward revision to an initial estimate published previously. The 
Federal Statistical Office cited significantly lower exports as a major drag on the 
economy, while private and government consumption expenditure rose. Private 
consumption benefited from substantially higher wages. The labour market outlook 
deteriorated, however. This contributed to the high level of uncertainty among 
consumers and thus dampened private consumption. Industrial output continued to 
decline, while construction probably stagnated. The still elevated financing costs, high 
economic policy uncertainty and the now very low capacity utilisation continued to 
weigh on investment and thus domestic demand for capital goods and construction 
work. In view of the deteriorated competitive position, German industry was unable to 
benefit from the growing foreign sales markets. 
Consistent with this, German banks’ lending business with enterprises remained 
anaemic in the final quarter of 2024, too.  Subdued demand for loans to enterprises 
reflects the difficult economic environment and uncertain economic outlook. This is 
consistent with the fact that, according to the  banks tightened their credit BLS,
standards on balance in the fourth quarter of 2024. The banks attributed this tighten-
ing to their lower risk tolerance and the increased credit risk. Banks’ lending business 
with households, on the other hand, continued its slight recovery observed since the 
summer. This was mainly due to the continued increase in demand for loans for house 
purchase, which benefited from falling lending rates and brisk demand for housing. 
Moreover, according to the  households’ greater optimism regarding housing BLS,
market prospects – including the expected house price developments and expected 
yields – also contributed to demand. 

Overview
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 134.2 Unemployment up moderately, wage growth still strong
Employment remained more stable in the fourth quarter than had been expected 
following the decline in the third quarter.  Overall employment remained at the level 
of the previous quarter. Hiring in some services sectors continued to offset the decline 
in employment in the manufacturing sector. Short-time work has risen noticeably since 
the summer holidays. Here, too, industrial jobs are most affected. Unemployment rose 
moderately, and the outlook remains subdued.  
Growth in negotiated wages was strong in the fourth quarter, albeit somewhat 
weaker than in the third quarter.  Including additional benefits, they were up by a 
substantial 5.8 % on the year in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared with 8.9 % in the 
previous quarter. A different picture emerges when special payments such as inflation 
compensation bonuses are stripped out of negotiated wages and only basic rates of 
remuneration are considered. In this configuration, negotiated wages rose by 6.6 % on 
the year in the fourth quarter, a distinctly stronger increase than in the third quarter 
(5.7 %). Negotiated wages overall once again rose more sharply in services than in 
manufacturing. In many services sectors, it is easier to attain higher wages than in 
industry and construction given the better economic situation. Actual earnings proba-
bly grew a little less strongly in the fourth than in the third quarter.
In recent times, there have been hardly any new agreements for larger sectors.  
Given the prolonged period of economic weakness and significantly lower inflation 
rates, the forthcoming wage negotiations will probably result in distinctly lower agree-
ments than in the past two years. 
4.3 Prices moderately higher despite reduced energy costs
Consumer prices (as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, or
HICP ) rose again moderately in the fourth quarter.  On average across the months of 
October to December 2024, consumer prices increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.5 %, 
compared with 0.4 % in the previous quarter. Falling energy prices continued to have a 
dampening effect. By contrast, food price inflation picked up again markedly. Services 
prices continued to rise significantly, but less sharply than in previous quarters. In the 

Overview
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 14case of non-energy industrial goods, however, price inflation saw a distinct uptick 
again. Annual headline inflation rose by 0.3 percentage point to 2.5 % in the fourth 
quarter. Core inflation  excluding energy and food) edged up slightly to 3.3 %. (HICP
Averaged over 2024, the inflation rate fell significantly to 2.5 %.  In 2023, it had come 
in at 6.0 %. In particular, the upward pressure on goods prices subsided substantially. 
At 2.8 %, the rate of inflation for food was close to the historical average in 2024. Infla-
tion for non-energy industrial goods fell to 1.4 % and likewise approached the historical 
average. Energy actually made a significantly negative contribution to the  rate. HICP
Only services inflation remained unusually high, at 4.3 %, and declined only a little 
compared with 2023. The large wage increases had a particularly strong impact here.
Inflation held steady at 2.8 % in January 2025.  In month-on-month terms, too, 
consumer price inflation continued at the same pace as in December. Energy prices 
increased especially strongly. This was due to both the increase in the national carbon 
price as of the beginning of the year and higher crude oil prices. The depreciation of 
the euro against the  dollar further amplified the price-driving effect of the higher US
crude oil prices. This contrasted with a steep decline in food prices. The prices of non-
energy industrial goods decreased marginally. Services became markedly more expen-
sive again recently. The price increase for the “Deutschlandticket” and higher costs in 
the health sector had an impact here. Annual core inflation rose somewhat, from 3.3 % 
in December to 3.6 % in January.
The inflation rate is likely to come down over the next few months, before going 
back up temporarily from the middle of the year.  Services are the main driver of the 
expected disinflation process. This is partly because of lower wage increases. Neverthe-
less, services inflation should remain significantly above average. By contrast, the 
contribution of energy is likely to pick up again over the course of the year, due, in part, 
to base effects. Food prices are expected to go up significantly due to price develop-
ments at upstream stages and after-effects from the exceptionally large wage 
increases in the retail sector. Prices of non-energy industrial goods will rise moderately 
from today’s perspective. On balance, the disinflation process is therefore likely to 
continue for the core inflation rate.
4.4 German economy could grow a little in first quarter
Despite the persistently weak underlying cyclical trend, economic output could pick 
up slightly in the first quarter.  Industry could be less of a drag than before in the first 

Overview
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 15quarter and construction could remain at roughly the level of the previous quarter. 
Factors such as high uncertainty, increased financing costs and low capacity utilisation 
are still weighing on investment. However, demand (as measured by order intake) has 
recently recovered somewhat in both sectors. Housing construction benefited from the 
decline in interest rates for building finance up to the end of 2024. Even so, surveys 
conducted by the  Institute on the shortage of orders and equipment utilisation did ifo
not indicate any improvement in January. By contrast, private consumption could 
expand again somewhat: the sharply higher wages offer further scope for additional 
consumer spending. At the same time, the labour market will probably continue to 
cool, with moderately declining employment and a slight rise in unemployment, and 
consumer sentiment remains gloomy. Consumers will therefore probably make only 
hesitant use of this additional scope for spending. Exports have recently been a particu-
lar dampener on economic activity. They may develop somewhat less unfavourably in 
the first few months of the current year. That would be the case, in particular, if they 
were to benefit from anticipatory effects in the face of looming  tariffs. All in all, US
economic output could see marginal growth in the first quarter. The German economy 
essentially remains trapped in stagnation. 

Overview
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 165 Public finances
5.1 Germany’s general government deficit remains relatively high
The general government deficit ratio remained at 2½ % last year, and there are no 
signs of any major change for 2025, either.  Although last year there were no signifi-
cant temporary burdens from the energy price brakes, in contrast to the previous year, 
some expenditure increased steeply (mainly on social security funds, but also on inter-
est, personnel, the promotion of climate-friendly electricity production under the 
Renewable Energy Sources Act and the Federal Armed Forces). On balance, the struc-
tural deficit ratio rose significantly to around 2 %. This year, expenditure-side price 
pressures are likely to ease, and climate-related spending could grow roughly in line 
with  Although expenditure on health, long-term care and pension insurance will GDP .
probably continue to grow significantly, this will be offset by more extensive additional 
revenue overall generated by higher contribution rates. Defence spending reached the
 agreement level of 2 % of  in 2024, and considerably higher levels and conse- NATO GDP
quently expanded scope for borrowing are now under discussion. However, there are 
still no plans for another significant surge in spending this year.
The central government deficits also remain relatively high despite compliance with 
the debt brake in 2024 and interim budget management since the beginning of the 
year.  The central government’s financial statistics deficit, including off-budget entities, 
fell significantly in 2024 to around €50 billion (2023: around €90 billion). However, this 
was also due to one-off factors, such as central government receiving more funds from
 and higher repayments of crisis assistance funds that it had granted in previous NGEU
years. Net borrowing fell short of the debt brake limit, and central government was still 
able to avoid tapping its reserves. This gave it additional leeway of €10 billion for the 
current year. Although there is no budget plan for 2025, this does not demand a restric-
tive spending stance. Tighter limits will ultimately apply only to new projects. Overall, it 
is important to keep the rules of the debt brake in mind. The Federal Minister of 
Finance reported the need to consolidate €16 billion in order to comply with the 
borrowing limit in the 2025 budget plan, which will be passed at a later date.    

Overview
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 175.2 Address structural weaknesses, safeguard sound public finances
Policymakers face the challenge of addressing structural weaknesses while 
safeguarding sound public finances in Germany.  Action is required in the area of 
public infrastructure and the sustainable financing of defence spending, for instance. 
The tax burden and expenditure ratios are already relatively high, and demographic 
developments will put an additional strain on public finances. Given such conflicting 
aims, binding fiscal rules like the debt brake play a crucial role in safeguarding sound 
public finances. In principle, given a low government debt ratio, adjusting the require-
ments of the debt brake in line with changing conditions seems justifiable. That said, 
higher upper limits must still be reliably binding and conducive to sound public 
finances. And even then, it remains essential to review priorities and use financial 
resources more effectively to better gear fiscal policy to the challenges. 
5.3 New  fiscal rules applied for the first timeEU
Initial experience with the new European fiscal rules has been gained in recent 
months.  For 22 of the 27 Member States, fiscal plans have now been agreed under the 
new rules. These plans set multi-year expenditure ceilings for expenditure growth to 
keep the debt and deficit ratios of each Member State within the agreed bounds. For 
some countries, the ceilings are higher than those originally proposed by the European 
Commission. For the highly indebted countries of France, Belgium and Italy, debt ratios 
will initially continue to rise as planned. By contrast, Portugal, Greece and Spain are set 
to see their debt ratios fall significantly. Five of the 22 countries extended the duration 
of their fiscal plan from four to seven years, thereby reducing the pressure to adjust. 
Germany is one of the five countries without a fiscal plan: the new Federal Government 
will have to submit a plan straight away.
Looking forward, it will be a matter of ensuring that the rules are implemented 
rigorously and that government finances remain on a sound footing.  In this context, 
it is notable that, in some cases, the Council granted extensive correction deadlines to 
countries subject to an excessive deficit procedure. Procedures were not initiated for 
certain countries despite the possibility that they could significantly fall short of the

favourable developments in some cases. In the case of highly indebted countries, in 
particular, it would be crucial to make appropriate adjustments as soon as necessary.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 22Energy commodity prices temporarily picked up markedly.  Continued production 
cuts by  and its partners, as well as new  sanctions against the Russian oil OPEC US
sector, pushed up oil prices at the beginning of 2025 (see supplementary information 
“The impact of western sanctions on Russian oil exports”). Since then, however, oil 
prices have again declined markedly. The new  administration’s appeals to expand US
oil production in the United States and in  countries probably played a major role OPEC
here. At the same time, emerging trade policy conflicts are likely to worsen prospects 
for global oil demand. Against this backdrop, the International Energy Agency  ()IEA
currently expects global oil markets to be well supplied in 2025.  As this report went to 
press, Brent crude oil cost $78 per barrel, only slightly more than in November. By US
contrast, European gas prices  have tended to rise noticeably and, at €49 per ()TTF
megawatt hour, are significantly higher than a year ago. In addition to less favourable 
weather conditions, which are accompanied by higher gas demand, this increase is 
likely to have been driven by the expiration of gas transit through Ukraine. As a result, 
European gas storage facilities are currently at 43 %, significantly lower than in the 
previous year. In addition to energy commodity prices, food commodity prices have 
also risen markedly recently, especially for coffee and cocoa.

The impact of western sanctions on Russian oil exports
After Russia began its war of aggression against Ukraine, an international coalition 
of western states, including the EU, the United States and the United Kingdom, 
imposed numerous sanctions on the Russian oil sector.  Some of the most important 
measures included the ’s oil embargo and the ’s price cap on Russian oil exports. EU G7
The ’s oil embargo bans European companies from importing Russian crude oil EU
(since December 2022) and petroleum products (since February 2023) by sea.  The  G7
price cap introduced in parallel prohibits western firms from participating in the 
maritime transportation of Russian oil if the price of the transported oil is above a limit 
set by  members.  The aim of these measures is to cut Russia’s oil revenues and G7
reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian oil imports without causing major disruptions 
to global oil markets.
Although these measures changed the destination of Russian oil exports, they had 
little impact on export volumes.  While Russia was still sending just under half of its 
crude oil and petroleum product exports to the  in 2021, this share has declined EU
sharply since the war began, falling to just 5 % by 2024.  To compensate for this,  EU
countries have since then been increasingly sourcing oil from the United States, 
Norway, Kazakhstan, India and the Middle East.  Russia, in turn, has found new 
customers for its oil, particularly in India, but also in China and Türkiye. Overall, Russian 
oil export volumes have fallen only marginally. 1)

1 Imports via pipeline, such as the Druzhba pipeline, are still permitted, however. Before the war started, these 
accounted for around 20 % of the ’s oil imports from Russia. They have also declined significantly in the EU
meantime, as Germany, for instance, has made a commitment since 2023 to no longer buy Russian oil.
2 For Russian crude oil, the price cap was set at $60 per barrel; for higher-value petroleum products such as US
diesel and gasoline, it was set at $100 per barrel; for lower-value products such as heating oil, it was set atUS
$45 per barrel.US
3 See International Energy Agency (2024, 2025).
4 India plays a special role in this: Since the start of the war, it has imported significant additional quantities of 
crude oil from Russia, processing it into petroleum products and then exporting these products to others, 
including Europe.
5 According to the  Russia exported 7.6 million barrels per day in 2024, compared with 7.8 million barrels per IEA,
day in 2021 (see International Energy Agency (2024, 2025)).

Global and European Setting
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 25In view of this, the impact of western sanctions on global oil prices was also limited.  
Immediately after the war broke out, oil prices had jumped out of concern for major 
supply shortfalls. Prices then returned to normal when it became apparent that very 
little oil would be withdrawn from the global oil market. 
That said, Russia’s exporters did have to accept price discounts against other oil 
blends when selling oil . On average, according to the data provider  these have LSEG ,
amounted to around $15 per barrel since the outbreak of the war. This is likely due US
to higher costs and risk premia for transporting Russian oil and the increased market 
power of the remaining customers associated with the diversion of Russian oil flows.

Global and European Setting
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 26Russia largely bypassed the G7 price cap by building up a “shadow fleet”.  This 
shadow fleet comprises ships operating outside the western, internationally recognised 
insurance system, and Russia now uses it to transport a large part of its seaborne oil 
exports. As a result, it can sell oil above the ceiling price set by the  price cap. The G7
price discounts for Russian oil blends also fell again.
Against this backdrop, Russia’s revenue from oil exports remained relatively high 
until recently.  According to the  they were only slightly lower in 2024, at aroundIEA, US
$189 billion, than before the start of the war.  Russia is therefore still able to generate 
large revenues from oil exports for its government budget and for warfare.

15 % higher in 2024 than in 2019, and that, without the sanctions, Russia would probably have achieved signifi-
cantly higher revenues.
8 Last year, revenue from oil exports contributed just under one-quarter of total government revenue at the 
federal level.

Global and European Setting
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 27Additional sanctions imposed by the former US administration at the beginning of 
January 2025 could dampen Russian oil exports somewhat.  New sanctions have been 
imposed, including on more than 180 shadow fleet vessels and selected Russian oil 
companies. These measures are likely to make it difficult, at least temporarily, for  
Russia to export oil, which might also dampen the associated revenue. At least this is 
what the slightly larger price discounts for Russian oil blends and elevated freight 
prices indicate once again. Tanker data also suggest that export volumes will be 
reduced slightly at least for a time. Global oil prices rose markedly after the sanctions 
were announced, but subsequently fell again for various reasons.
The new US administration’s intention to expand the global oil supply might also 
reduce Russia’s oil revenues.  President Trump is planning to step up national oil US
production significantly while putting pressure on  to increase its supply consider- OPEC

revenues on a lasting basis. The question remains, however, whether  will follow OPEC

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 281.1 China sees economic recovery at the end of 2024 with a subdued 
underlying trend
In China, economic growth increased somewhat at the end of 2024.  Real  rose GDP
significantly in the final quarter of 2024, increasing by 1.6 %, seasonally adjusted, 
compared with the previous quarter. The government thus precisely achieved its 2024 
growth target of 5 %. Higher private consumption was important for the final year-end 
spurt. This was mainly due to government purchase incentives, such as vehicle and 
household appliance scrapping schemes. In addition, exports of goods remained very 
vigorous. Measured in  dollars, they exceeded their previous year’s figure by one-US
tenth in the fourth quarter.  As imports continued to be sluggish, customs statistics 
indicate that China achieved a record trade surplus of nearly $ 1 trillion last year.US
Despite this short-term improvement, the underlying trend remained subdued.  The 
additional tariffs imposed by  President Trump at the beginning of February on all US
imports from China could hit the Chinese export economy significantly. In response, 
China introduced retaliatory tariffs on certain  products. All in all, there is a risk that US
trade tensions between the two economies will intensify further. Domestically, the crisis 
in the housing market has still not been overcome. The increase in private consumption 
at the end of 2024 is also likely to be partly due to forward effects and therefore not 
sustainable. In any case, the strengthened growth had hardly been reflected in prices. 
Consumer price inflation was only slightly above zero in December. The core rate was 
also still very low at 0.4 %. 3) 
3 In the face of the threat of  import tariffs, forward effects may have played a role here, but they are likely to US
ultimately explain only part of the growth boost. Exports of goods to the United States grew only slightly faster 
in the fourth quarter than total exports.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 291.2 Mixed picture in other major emerging market economies
In India, the economy appears to have continued to expand at a slower pace.  Annual
 growth in the third quarter of 2024 slowed significantly again to 5.4 %. Over the GDP
past few months, expansion appears to have continued at a slower pace. For the new 
fiscal year, the government plans to stimulate domestic private demand through tax 
cuts. Consumer price inflation weakened slightly in recent months, reaching 4.3 % in 
January. The central bank is aiming for a band of between 2 % and 6 % for inflation. At 
its monetary policy meeting in early February, it lowered its key interest rate by 25 basis 
points to 6.25 %.
Brazil’s economy is also likely to have expanded markedly at the end of 2024.  In the 
third quarter, economic output exceeded the previous year by 4 %, and in the final 
quarter this strong expansion has probably continued. However, there are now 
growing signs of overheating. There is a very high level of employment by Brazilian 
standards, and wages are rising steeply. Consumer price inflation rose to 4.8 % in the 
final quarter, putting it above the central bank’s target corridor. Contrary to the global 
trend, the bank thus raised the key interest rate from 10.75 % in October to 13.25 % at 
the end of the period under review.

apparent in the labour market in particular, partly because of the recruitment of 
soldiers. The unemployment rate, at 2.2 %, was at a historical low, and wages rose 
sharply. At the same time, the government continued with its loose fiscal stance. High 
government revenue from oil sales continued to safeguard the budget (see supplemen-

1.3  economic activity persistently buoyantUS
In the United States, the economic upswing persisted to the end of the year.  In the 
fourth quarter,  rose by 0.6 % in price and seasonally adjusted terms compared GDP
with the previous quarter. Without the one-off negative effects, growth would probably 
have been somewhat stronger. Hurricanes and industrial disputes impacted economic 
activity at times. This was reflected, amongst other things, in a decline in investment in 
machinery and equipment.  Build-up of inventories came to a standstill as well. Stimu-
lus from abroad was also absent.  By contrast, households remained in a spending 
mood. The construction sector also benefited from lively demand. Investment in private 
housing construction rose markedly. At the same time, fiscal policy remained expan-
sionary. Public sector consumption and investment expenditure increased markedly 
again in the final quarter.
The US economy was in solid shape at the beginning of the new year as well.  In 
January 2025, moderate employment growth continued and the unemployment rate 
fell slightly. There was another considerable rise in wages. Against this backdrop, there 
has been a recent failure to make progress in the disinflation process. In January, year- 4)

percentage point to 4.25 %–4.5 % from August to December 2024.
The outlook for the US economy largely depends on future economic policy.  Accord-
ing to surveys, after the presidential election in November, many companies were 
initially far more optimistic about the future. It appears that they linked the change of 
government primarily with hopes for tax cuts and deregulation. However, the new 
government’s first official acts also signal that calls during the campaign for a strict 
immigration policy and massive tariff increases are being implemented as a priority. 
For example, imports of goods from China have been subject to additional tariffs of 
10 % since the beginning of February. Imports from Mexico and Canada could be 
subject to new levies of up to 25 % of the value of the goods as of March. According to 
government data, similar barriers to trade are being considered on imports from the

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 321.4 Weakening domestic demand in Japan
The Japanese economy expanded vigorously in the fourth quarter.  According to 
initial estimates,  went up by 0.7 % in price and seasonally adjusted terms GDP
compared with the previous quarter. This good  result obscures the fact that GDP
domestic demand was weak. Growth in private consumption was less pronounced than 
in the third quarter, which can be attributed, amongst other things, to consumer price 
inflation, which is very strong by Japanese standards. One exception was industrial 
investment, which rose markedly again following a setback in the previous quarter. The 
fact that economic output nevertheless rose sharply was mainly due to the fact that 
demand was tied more strongly to domestic goods and services than before. Imports 
thus fell sharply and exports increased noticeably, meaning that, in arithmetical terms,
 growth was fully driven by net exports. The unemployment rate remained low at GDP
2.4 % in December and wages continued to rise dynamically. Inflation increased signifi-
cantly at the end of the year. The phasing-out of subsidies for electricity and gas as well 
as sharply rising food prices led to consumer prices rising by 3.6 % year-on-year in

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 33December. Inflation excluding energy and food fell slightly to 1.6 %. The Bank of Japan 
expects this year’s wage negotiations to lead to strong wage increases again. It thus 
raised its policy rate to 0.5 % in January.
1.5 Subdued economic activity in the United Kingdom
In the United Kingdom, economic output also improved slightly in the final quarter.  
Real  rose by 0.1 % in the fourth quarter in price and seasonally adjusted terms GDP
compared with the previous period. As in the third quarter, construction developed 
quite vigorously. Services sector activity expanded slightly. At the same time, manufac-
turing output declined significantly. In line with the overall weak economic develop-
ments, sentiment among purchasing managers remained subdued until the end of the 
period under review. The labour market situation also continued to cool. However, 
wage dynamics remained buoyant. The annual wage growth rate recently rose to 6.0 %. 
Annual  inflation also increased, reaching 3.0 % in January. The core rate has HICP
climbed to 3.7 %. Nevertheless, the Bank of England expected the disinflation process 
to continue and lowered its policy rate by a further 25 basis points to 4.5 % at the begin-
ning of February.
1.6 Polish economy returns to growth path
In Poland, economic growth picked up momentum at the end of the year.  According 
to provisional data, real  rose significantly, up 1.3 % on the quarter in seasonally GDP
adjusted terms, following an increase of just 0.1 % in the third quarter. The positive 
underlying cyclical trend thus prevailed again following the expiry of temporary one-off 
burdens. The macroeconomic recovery was broad-based. Services sector activity contin-
ued to expand substantially, and the production of intermediate and capital goods 
picked up markedly. The construction sector also recovered at the end of the year, 
mainly in the area of civil engineering. Private consumption, by contrast is expected to 
have increased only moderately. The continued strong inflation of 4.7 % year on year 
dampened the increase in households’ purchasing power. This weighed on consumer 
confidence and retail sales rose only marginally in price-adjusted terms. The labour 
market continues to be characterised by tightness. The unemployment rate remained 
at a very low level of 3.0 % and gross wages in the corporate sector rose by around 10 % 
year on year. The National Bank of Poland left its policy rate unchanged at 5.75 %.

Global and European Setting
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 342 Subdued economic activity in the euro area
Economic output in the euro area rose only slightly in the fourth quarter of 2024, 
following substantial growth in the previous quarter.  According to Eurostat’s flash 
estimate, real  rose by 0.1 % on the preceding quarter after price and seasonal GDP
adjustment. In the third quarter,  in the euro area had risen by 0.4 % as a result of GDP
one-off factors, in particular the Olympics in France. Overall, the underlying cyclical 
trend in the euro area in the second half of 2024 thus remained subdued. A 
pronounced weakness in the manufacturing sector was offset by brisk business in 
some services sectors and some improvement in the construction sector. Private 
consumption – and probably also investment – rose accordingly, while exports contin-
ued to weaken. The outlook remains subdued overall. While the business climate has 
improved somewhat, and the depreciation of the euro could provide some support, 
various factors are hindering a considerable economic upswing. These include, in partic-
ular, the slow pace of adjustment processes in industry, domestic political instability 
and the reform backlog in several Member States, geopolitical crises and developments 
in international trade conflicts which are difficult to predict. 
Private consumption continued to grow.  Although this growth was probably not as 
strong as in the previous quarter, private consumption remained clearly on an upward 
trajectory. New car registrations rose sharply after two consecutive declines, and retail 
sales continued to increase in price-adjusted terms. The continued marked growth in 
wage income alongside the return of more moderate inflation rates is likely to have 
played a major role in the gradual recovery in private consumption. In any case, house-
holds assessed their financial situation to have improved and increasingly stated that 
they planned to make major purchases. However, expectations regarding future 
economic developments deteriorated somewhat, and worries about unemployment 
grew. 

Global and European Setting
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 35Investment activity is likely to have intensified in the quarter ended.  Construction 
production rose quite significantly until October, probably substantially supported by 
infrastructure measures. Housing construction also appears to have stabilised. Invest-
ment in machinery and equipment recovered somewhat after a weak previous quarter. 
In any case, capital goods producers’ domestic sales rose markedly after price adjust-
ment, following a prolonged period of weakness. In addition, in view of the tightening 
of environmental requirements at the beginning of 2025, transport equipment was 
purchased to a greater extent. Expenditure on information and communication techno-
logies and on intellectual property is likely to have risen further owing to the trend 
towards digitalisation. It is possible that the improvement in financing conditions has 
already been reflected in investment. However, the difficult underlying conditions are 
likely to prevent a major revival in investment activity.
Exports of goods to third countries increased somewhat in the fourth quarter in 
price-adjusted terms.  Exports of consumer goods, in particular, probably rose 
markedly, but exports of capital goods also appear to have expanded somewhat. 
Exports of intermediate goods, by contrast, fell. From a regional perspective, revenue 
from exports to China continued to fall. Exports to the United Kingdom remained 
subdued and exports to the United States grew again. Overall, euro area exports thus 
continued to benefit only marginally from the growth in sales markets. The low compet-
itiveness of industrial enterprises, which according to surveys by the European Commis-
sion has deteriorated further of late, is probably particularly noticeable here. Euro area 
services exports are likely to have fallen, according to balance of payments data. Goods 
imports from third countries rose again in price-adjusted terms. Imports of capital and 
consumer goods probably increased again, while imports of intermediate goods are 
likely to have fallen.
The slowdown in manufacturing continued.  The production of intermediate goods, in 
particular, fell markedly in the fourth quarter, as did the production of capital goods 
once again. By contrast, the production of consumer goods recovered. Industrial capac-
ity utilisation rose slightly, but continued to fall short of its long-term average. Industry 
is under strain not only from the subdued investment activity in the euro area, but also  9)

remained low. Thanks to falling energy prices, producer and import prices fell year on 
year.
The upswing in the services sectors continued.  Activities in the information and 
communication sector in particular, as well as in the real estate sector, are likely to have 
increased markedly. In addition, business activity in the hotel and restaurant sector 
may well have increased. According to European Commission surveys, a shortage of 
labour continues to weigh on the services sector. The importance of insufficient 
demand as a factor limiting production increased in recent quarters, but remained 
below the long-term average.
Economic growth weakened in several Member States compared with the previous 
quarter.  This was partly due to the expiry of one-off effects. At the same time, the 
persistent weakness in exports dampened growth in some places. In various southern 
countries, buoyant economic activity driven by domestic demand continued. 
The French economy stagnated in the final quarter.  According to preliminary 
estimates, real  decreased by 0.1 %. The weakness in the fourth quarter was partly GDP
due to a countermovement after the Olympics, which had been a significant driver of 
growth in the third quarter. Exports were burdened by a significant decline in the 
export of services, which also encompass broadcast rights. Investment remained 


Global and European Setting
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 37subdued overall. In this context, the increase in investment in machinery and equip-
ment and intellectual property was offset by a significant decline in expenditure on 
construction. Although private consumption lost momentum, it still increased 
markedly. On the output side, weaknesses were evident in manufacturing in particular, 
and even more so in construction.
In Italy, economic output continued to stagnate.  According to provisional data, real
 in the fourth quarter remained at the same level as in the previous quarter. Stimu- GDP
lus is likely to have been provided by exports of goods. Industrial output stabilised after 
having contracted markedly in previous quarters. By contrast, imports are likely to have 
fallen, partly as a result of the weakening recovery in private consumption. Further-
more, gross fixed capital formation is likely to have continued to decline. Developments 
in construction investment are likely to have made a marked contribution to this, as 
there is a lack of new impetus following the gradual wearing-off of the effects of the tax 
bonus for construction measures in the area of energy efficiency and earthquake safety 
(“superbonus”), which had provided a boost for a number of years. According to initial 
data from the statistical office, the activity of service providers also fell.
Buoyant economic activity in Spain continued.  According to preliminary estimates, 
real  increased once again by 0.8 %. Growth was broad-based on both the output GDP

rose very significantly in view of strong domestic demand. The strong growth in the 
Spanish economy, which has persisted since 2021, has now driven down the unemploy-
ment rate to 10.6 %, though this remains high by euro area standards.
The picture was mixed in the other Member States.  There was significant growth in 
Portugal and Lithuania. In the Netherlands, real  grew somewhat more moderately GDP
again recently, following two strong increases. A small increase was recorded in 
Belgium. Economic output stagnated in Austria and Estonia. There was a slight decline 
in aggregate economic activity in Germany (see section “ ”) and a The German economy
marked decline in Ireland. 
The labour market situation remained favourable at the end of the year, but there 
were growing signs of an emerging deterioration.  According to provisional data, the 
number of people in work rose again slightly in the final quarter. Although the 
unemployment rate remained at a low of 6.3 %, it rose in individual countries, including 
Germany and France. Employment expectations have been falling since March. The 
same applies to the vacancy rate. Wage growth is likely to have been comparatively 
strong recently, at 4 % to 5 % on the year, but the underlying trend has been declining 
for some time now. 
Euro area consumer prices rose again moderately in the fourth quarter of 2024 
compared with the previous quarter.  The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices
 rose by 0.5 % in seasonally adjusted terms, which was similarly moderate to the ( ) HICP
previous two quarters. Energy prices continued to fall, but less significantly than in the 
summer. Food prices increased somewhat more strongly again. Services prices contin-
ued to rise substantially, by 0.6 %, but less than in previous quarters. Inflation for non-
energy industrial products remained weak. 
The HICP  rate remained at 2.2 % in year-on-year terms.  The continued negative contri-
bution of energy had a slight dampening effect on the annual rate. Food prices rose 
somewhat more strongly than in the third quarter, in line with the rise in international 
commodity prices. Price dynamics remained elevated, especially for processed food. 
However, prices for unprocessed food also rose more sharply again recently. Inflation 
in services remained particularly substantial, with the annual rate of  inflation here HICP
persisting at around 4 % for more than a year. As in previous quarters, prices for non-
energy industrial products rose moderately; the disinflation process here is thus proba-
bly largely complete. Core inflation excluding energy and food fell only slightly to 2.7 %. 

Global and European Setting
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 39On an average of 2024, the headline rate fell significantly to 2.4 % and the core infla-
tion rate fell somewhat more sharply to 2.9 %.  In 2023, headline inflation had stood at 
5.4 % and core inflation at 6.3 %. The significant decline was driven by the substantial 
drop in inflation for food and non-energy industrial goods. 
According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, the inflation rate in the euro area amounted 
to 2.5 % in January 2025.  The  rate thus rose slightly by 0.1 percentage point HICP
compared with December. Services continued to have a significant price-driving effect. 
Energy prices picked up somewhat more substantially again of late. Prices of industrial 
goods excluding energy continued to rise moderately. Food inflation declined 
somewhat, but more strongly for processed food than for unprocessed food. The core 
inflation rate (excluding energy and food) remained unchanged at 2.7 %. The disinfla-
tion process should continue over the coming months, in no small part due to the 
assumption that services inflation, which is still high, will gradually decline. 


Global and European Setting
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 40Economic activity in the euro area is expected to rise again slightly in the first

and, in some cases, have deteriorated further recently. The restructuring of industry 
has only just begun and is taking place under high uncertainty. This uncertainty is also 
being fuelled by the tense international situation. Geopolitical conflicts and increasingly 
overt disputes over trade relations are contributing to this.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 431 Monetary policy and money market developments
At its monetary policy meeting in December 2024, the Governing Council of the ECB 
lowered the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points for the fourth time in 2024. 
Following this interest rate reduction, the deposit facility rate, through which the 
Governing Council steers the monetary policy stance, stood at 3 % at the end of the 
year (see Chart 2.1). From the Governing Council’s perspective, the disinflation process 
is well on track. Eurosystem staff revised the projections for headline inflation slightly 
downwards for 2024 and 2025 compared with September. Staff now see headline infla-
tion averaging 2.4 % in 2024, 2.1 % in 2025 and 1.9 % in 2026. They expect an average of 
2.1 % for 2027, when the expanded  Emissions Trading System becomes operational. EU
Most measures of underlying inflation suggest that inflation will settle at around the 
2 % medium-term target on a sustained basis. Domestic inflation has edged down but 
remains high.
In addition, the Governing Council adjusted its communication, removing earlier 
references to the level and duration of restriction.  The Governing Council is deter-
mined to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at its 2 % medium-term target. It 
will follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the 
appropriate monetary policy stance. The Governing Council’s interest rate decisions will 
be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic 
and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary 
policy transmission. The Governing Council is not pre-committing to a particular rate 
path.

Monetary policy and banking business
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 44In January, the Governing Council lowered the key ECB interest rates once again by 
25 basis points.  Since the cut in interest rates, the deposit facility rate, which is the 
important policy rate for the monetary policy stance, has stood at 2.75 %. Inflation has 
continued to develop broadly in line with the staff projections and is set to return to the 
Governing Council’s 2 % medium-term target in the course of this year. The Governing 
Council reiterated that it will follow a data-dependent approach to determining the 
appropriate monetary policy stance. 
Short-term money market rates moved completely in line with the reductions in key 
interest rates.  Following the cut in key interest rates in January, the euro short-term 
rate  closed the reporting period at 2.667 %, which was around 9 basis points ( ) €STR
below the new level of the deposit facility rate.
Market participants are expecting to see three further rate cuts before the end of 
2025.  The median response from the Eurosystem’s Survey of Monetary Analysts 
conducted ahead of the January meeting indicated that participants are expecting to 
see three further rate cuts of 25 basis points each up until June. Following the June 
meeting, no further interest rate steps are currently expected for the remainder of the 
year. And the money market, too, is currently pricing in three further interest rate cuts 
this year, including an interest rate step of 25 basis points for the March meeting.


Monetary policy and banking business
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 45Monetary policy securities holdings shrank further as of mid-November.  This was 
again because assets held under the asset purchase programme  matured and ( )APP
were not reinvested. In addition, since the beginning of the year, the Eurosystem has 
no longer been reinvesting any principal payments from maturing securities under the 
pandemic emergency purchase programme  On 7 February 2025, aggregate ( ). PEPP
Eurosystem holdings of assets under the  amounted to €2,641.1 billion (for a break-APP
down of these holdings by individual asset purchase programme, see the supplemen-
tary information entitled “Money market management and liquidity needs”). Asset 
holdings reported under the  came to €1,592.6 billion on the same day. PEPP
Excess liquidity declined further.  At last count, it stood at €2,877 billion. The contrac-
tion was due, in part, to the final repayments under the third series of targeted longer-
term refinancing operations (  III) in December. This means that the  III TLTRO TLTRO
operations have been repaid in full to the Eurosystem. Maturing  and  assets APP PEPP
likewise caused excess liquidity to shrink. Excess liquidity was also influenced by devel-
opments in autonomous factors (see the supplementary information entitled “Money 
market management and liquidity needs”).

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 46Supplementary information
Money market management and liquidity needs
In the reporting period from 23 October 2024 to 4 February 2025,  excess liquidity in 
the Eurosystem decreased by a total of €83 billion to an average of €2,912.4 billion, 
though it remained at a high level. The main driver of this decline was the reduction in 
the outstanding volume of monetary policy purchase programmes.
Compared with the sixth reserve maintenance period of 2024 (September to 
October 2024), liquidity needs in the Eurosystem stemming from autonomous factors 
(see Table 2.1) fell by €66.9 billion to an average of €1,228 billion in the eighth reserve 
maintenance period of 2024 (December 2024 to February 2025). Without this liquidity-
providing effect, excess liquidity would have contracted even more sharply. The decline 
in liquidity needs was caused primarily by the increase of €73.1 billion in the sum of net 
foreign assets and other factors. These two variables are considered together owing to 
liquidity-neutral valuation effects. In addition, government deposits fell by €10.2 billion. 
By contrast, the €16.4 billion increase in banknotes in circulation had a liquidity-absorb-
ing effect. In Germany, the rise in net banknote issuance of €11.3 billion to 
€952.4 billion represented the strongest liquidity-absorbing effect among the 
autonomous factors. Over the period under review, the minimum reserve requirement 
in the Eurosystem marginally increased by €1 billion to €163.9 billion, which marginally 
raised the need for central bank liquidity. By contrast, the reserve requirement in 
Germany went up by €0.7 billion to €45.1 billion. Euro area commercial banks held 94 % 
of their central bank liquidity in the deposit facility (Germany: 95 %). 1)

The average outstanding tender volume in the euro area decreased by €28.7 billion to 
€28.2 billion during the reporting period. The maturity date of the final tranche of the 
third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations  III.10) fell during the (TLTRO
period under review on 18 December 2024. A volume of €29.2 billion matured. This 
decline was partially offset by the fact that the allotments in the main refinancing opera-
tion and the three-month tender that also had a value date of 18 December 2024 
increased by €3.1 billion and €11 billion, respectively, compared with the maturing 
operations in each case. At the end of the year, the main refinancing operation saw 
greater demand totalling €17 billion, representing an increase of €8.1 billion over the 
preceding week. In Germany, the average outstanding volume of all refinancing opera-
tions fell by €5.3 billion to €4.5 billion in the period under review. This was partly due to 
the maturity of the  III operations in December, which amounted to €7.4 billion. TLTRO
German banks’ share in the outstanding volume of Eurosystem refinancing operations 
came to around 16 %, which was 1 percentage point higher than in the sixth reserve 
maintenance period of 2024.
The scaling-down of the asset purchase programme  portfolio had the greatest ( )APP
impact on the overall amount of securities held for monetary policy purposes. Another 
contributing factor was principal payments from maturing securities under the 
pandemic emergency purchase programme  which were only partially ( ), PEPP
reinvested as of the second half of 2024 and have not been reinvested at all since the 
beginning of 2025. Overall, holdings of monetary policy assets decreased by an 
average of €121 billion between the sixth and eighth reserve maintenance periods of 
2024. As at 4 February 2025, the balance sheet holdings of the asset purchase 
programmes totalled €4,238.2 billion (see Table 2.2) and thus remained at a high level.

Monetary policy and banking business
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 50In an environment of falling Eurosystem policy rates and declining excess liquidity, the 
spread between overnight rates in the euro money market and the deposit facility rate 
gradually narrowed further. The unsecured euro short-term rate  fell to an ( ) €STR
average of 3.16 % in the seventh reserve maintenance period of 2024 and 2.92 % in the 
eighth reserve maintenance period of 2024 due to the Eurosystem interest rate cuts in 
October and December, respectively. The transmission of the Eurosystem deposit facil-
ity rate to the  was thus smooth and complete. The average spread between the €STR
deposit facility rate and the  decreased by 0.4 basis point to 8.2 basis points in the €STR
eighth reserve maintenance period of 2024. Average trading volumes rose again follow-
ing declines in the previous reserve maintenance periods. On average each day, 
€52.3 billion was traded in the seventh reserve maintenance period of 2024 and 
€54.4 billion was traded in the eighth reserve maintenance period of 2024. By compari-
son, daily averages of €53.4 billion and €48.1 billion were traded in the fifth and sixth 
reserve maintenance periods, respectively. As in the previous reporting period, hardly 
any month-end effects could be observed and, even at the end of the year, the  €STR
saw hardly any change, declining by 1.1 basis points over the previous day. By contrast, 
transaction volumes fell at the end of 2024, declining by €6.8 billion to €33.8 billion, 
which were the lowest volumes since the end of 2022. 
On Eurex Repo’s  Pooling trading platform, rates on secured overnight transactions GC
were close to the deposit facility rate during the period under review amid persistently 
high transaction volumes. In the  basket, trading in the seventh reserve mainte-ECB
nance period of 2024 was conducted at an average rate of 3.24 %. In the eighth reserve 
maintenance period of 2024, the rate fell to 2.96 %. In the  EXTended basket, which ECB
has a broader selection of securities with lower rating requirements for concluding 
repo transactions, trading took place at average rates of 3.25 % and 2.98 %, respec-
tively. The transmission of the monetary policy deposit facility rate to secured interest 
rates was thus smooth and complete. The wider spread between average interest rates 
and the deposit facility rate in the eighth reserve maintenance period of 2024 was due 
to the fact that the interest rate in the  basket fell by 74 basis points to 2.23 % and ECB
the interest rate in  EXTended basket fell by 33 basis points to 2.66 % on the final ECB
day of the year. Averaging €10 billion, the daily volume of transactions in the  ECB
basket continued to grow. By contrast, the volume in the  EXTended basket ECB
remained virtually unchanged at €4.8 billion.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 522 Monetary developments in the euro area
The broad monetary aggregate M3 saw significant growth again in the fourth 
quarter of 2024.  As inflows remained at the same high level as in the summer half-
year, monetary dynamics stabilised: the annual growth rate of  came to 3.5 % at the M3
end of December 2024, up from 0 % at the end of 2023 (see Chart 2.5). Growth in the 
money supply during the quarter under review was bolstered in particular by inflows 
into  deposits, as the opportunity costs of holding money declined further and M3
economic uncertainties boosted the appeal of liquid assets. On the counterpart side, 
banks’ lending to domestic non-banks replaced inflows from abroad as the main factor 
driving monetary growth, with the upward trend in loans to households gaining in 
strength. Furthermore, loans to non-financial corporations showed some signs of recov-
ery as well, though probably only a gradual one given the subdued growth prospects 
for the euro area. Banks surveyed in the Bank Lending Survey  reported a ( )BLS
marginal uptick in demand for loans to enterprises in the fourth quarter of 2024. 

Monetary policy and banking business
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 53Money holdings of private non-banks grew markedly again in the final quarter of 
2024.  Highly liquid overnight deposits in particular saw the largest inflows (see Table 
2.3). This could be related to the elevated economic uncertainty and high saving rate of 
households. Unlike in the previous quarters, households added significantly to their 
overnight deposits whilst at the same time scaling back their short-term time deposits 
as yield spreads narrowed – for the first time since the second quarter of 2022. In 
addition, they boosted their holdings of short-term savings deposits, especially with 
French banks, which paid interest on tax-privileged savings books at the end of the 
year. Consistent with brisker lending to non-financial corporations in the fourth 
quarter, this sector likewise added significantly to its holdings of overnight deposits. In 
addition to inflows from sales and borrowing, non-financial corporations also moved 
funds out of short-term time deposits into overnight money or sight deposits, thus 
leaving the reporting quarter with what was, on balance, the largest build-up of 
overnight deposits by non-financial corporations since the first quarter of 2021.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 54MFI longer-term liabilities continued to dampen M3. Unlike in the previous quarters,

banks cut back again on their net issuance of bank bonds, which they had previously 
increased to fund the repayment of the  III loans. Even so, longer-term liabilities TLTRO
to other non-  in the euro area continued to dampen  because banking sector MFIs M3

Monetary policy and banking business
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 55On the counterpart side, loans to domestic non-banks were once again the main 
factor driving monetary growth, for the first time in just over two years.  Contribu-
tions to this rise in lending came mainly from loans to financial and non-financial corpo-
rations and from loans to households in the euro area. Lending to general government 
saw barely any growth on balance in the fourth quarter of 2024. This was due to the 
gradual reduction of government bonds that the Eurosystem had purchased up to mid-
2022 under its monetary policy asset purchase programmes.
Loans to non-financial corporations bounced back significantly in the fourth 
quarter, but whether this recovery is sustainable remains to be seen.  Net inflows 
into loans were markedly higher in the fourth quarter of 2024 than in the previous 
quarters (see Chart 2.6) for two reasons. First, the declining lending rates buoyed 
demand for loans. Second, enterprises also appear to have replaced bonds with bank 
loans. This unexpectedly strong increase in loans is unlikely to continue in the coming 
quarters because the economy is recovering at only a slow pace. An analysis at the 
country level reveals that significant impetus for loan growth continued to come only 
from banks from France and some smaller countries. Banks in Germany recorded only 
slim growth, primarily from cross-border lending (see the chapter entitled “German 
). Banks in Italy and banks’ deposit and lending business with domestic customers ”
Spain saw their net lending decline slightly.  


Monetary policy and banking business
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 56On aggregate, growth in corporate loans is likely to recover only slowly.  Amid 
subdued growth prospects, structural challenges and geopolitical uncertainty, corpo-
rate investment activity in the euro area has been weak thus far. In addition, the  ECB
survey on the access to finance of enterprises in the euro area  suggests that, on (SAFE )
aggregate, the surveyed enterprises have so far been able to finance their compara-
tively weak investment activity largely out of internal funds. Hence, the percentage of 
enterprises that did not apply for bank loans in the fourth quarter of 2024 because they 
had sufficient internal funds at their disposal was significantly higher than the level 
seen in the previous years (see Chart 2.7).
According to the BLS, banks observed a marginal uptick in demand for loans 
amongst enterprises in the fourth quarter – as in the previous quarter – following 
what had been, in some cases, significant declines in the preceding quarters.  The 
banks saw the decline in the general level of interest rates and the increased financing 
needs for inventories and working capital as a source of expansionary impulses. By 
contrast, financing needs for fixed investment provided no support for demand for 
loans. Some  banks, meanwhile, reported that economic and political uncertainty, BLS
taken in isolation, had dampened demand for loans.  For the first quarter of 2025, the 
 1) 
1 See European Central Bank (2025).

Monetary policy and banking business
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 57surveyed banks are expecting demand for loans to enterprises to remain virtually 
unchanged.
In the face of cyclical risks, the BLS banks tightened their credit standards for loans 
to enterprises again on balance, after leaving them unchanged in the previous 
quarter for the first time in around three years.  The  banks’ main reason for tight-BLS
ening their credit standards was the decline in their risk tolerance in the fourth quarter 
of 2024 and the increase in credit risk due to the subdued economic situation and 
outlook as well as industry-specific and firm-specific factors. According to the  the BLS,
deterioration of various indicators of credit quality (such as the non-performing loan 
ratio) had, when taken in isolation, exerted a significantly restrictive effect on credit 
standards over the past six months. New supervisory or regulatory requirements under 
the Basel III reform package also had a restrictive effect in 2024. For the first quarter of 
2025, the  banks are planning to further tighten their credit standards for loans to BLS
enterprises. 
Loans to households saw the moderate upswing continue.  The fourth quarter of 2024 
saw the pace of lending increase again over the previous quarters (see Chart 2.6); in 
spite of this, net lending growth remained well below the level before monetary policy 
tightening began in mid-2022. The recovery was driven by increasing demand for loans 
for house purchase. The upturn in this loan category should be considered in the 
context of lending rates that have been in decline since the start of the year as well as 
households’ real income growth. Responses by the banks surveyed in the  confirm BLS
the existence of an upward movement. For the second successive time, they reported a 
significant increase in demand in this loan category. They attributed this primarily to 
the decline in the general level of interest rates. Moreover, the  banks reported that BLS
households had a more upbeat assessment of housing market prospects than before. 
Demand is expected to pick up further in the fourth quarter, according to the  BLS
banks.
The banks surveyed in the BLS left their credit standards for housing loans 
unchanged on balance.  After banks had eased their credit standards in the past three 
quarters, the increase in pressure from competition, which had an expansionary effect, 
in the fourth quarter of 2024 contrasted primarily with a decline in risk tolerance, which 
had a restrictive effect. For the first quarter of 2025, the  banks are planning to BLS
tighten their credit standards somewhat.
Consumer credit grew again significantly in the fourth quarter of 2024.  Similarly, 
other lending to households, which includes loans to sole proprietors, for example, also 

Monetary policy and banking business
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 58expanded again slightly in net terms, the first time it has done so since 2022. The banks 
surveyed in the  assessing both loan categories together, also reported that house- BLS,
hold demand had picked up in the fourth quarter. In the banks’ view, the declining 
general level of interest rates, in particular, supported demand for loans. At the same 
time, the surveyed banks further tightened their credit standards for consumer credit 
and other lending, reportedly due to an increase in credit risk and a decline in their risk 
tolerance.
Alongside bank lending, inflows from abroad contributed to money growth as well.  
Though noticeably smaller than in the previous quarters, these inflows were nonethe-
less large overall. This was mainly due to a further increase in the euro area’s current 
account surplus with the rest of the world. The most recent balance of payments statis-
tics data suggest, furthermore, that portfolio investment with non-residents was also 
continuing to make a positive contribution, even though non-resident demand for 
investment in the euro area declined on balance.
3 German banks’ deposit and lending business with domestic customers
The German banking sector’s deposit business with domestic non-banks grew 
robustly in the final quarter of 2024.  This was mainly because households and non-fi-
nancial corporations added substantially to their holdings of overnight deposits, much 
like in the euro area as a whole. They probably did this in response to the heightened 
economic uncertainty and the subdued consumer and business climate (see the  GfK
consumer climate or the Ifo business climate in the chapter entitled “The German 
economy”). At the same time, both sectors reduced their short-term time deposits for 
the first time in just under three years. This turnaround and the strong inflows into 
overnight deposits suggest that the interest-induced portfolio shifts observed in recent 
years have halted for now. In line with this, the spread between yields on different 
types of deposit in Germany have narrowed as monetary policy rates were lowered (see 
Chart 2.8). Inflows into short-term deposits were accompanied by a slight increase in 
longer-term deposits. This came mainly as a result of securitisation activity among 
financial corporations. 2) 
2 These were “synthetic” securitisation transactions, in which the bank transfers only the credit risk in tranches 
to a special purpose entity, while the loan itself remains on the bank’s balance sheet. A long-term time deposit 
by the special purpose entity matching the term of the loan is often used as a counterpart entry.

Monetary policy and banking business
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 59German banks’ loan and securitised lending business with domestic enterprises and 
households grew noticeably again in the final quarter of 2024.  Banks increased their 
loans again slightly and also raised their holdings of securities issued by domestic 
private issuers – in particular bonds of other financial institutions – by more than they 
had done in previous quarters. Lending to domestic general government, meanwhile, 
was significantly weaker than in the previous quarters. While German banks increased 
their loans to general government, they also reduced their holdings of German govern-
ment securities, leaving lending to general government only slightly positive overall 
(see Table 2.4).

households. 5 Non-financial corporations and quasi-corporations.
Banks’ loan business with households continued its slight recovery observed since 
the summer.  This was mainly due to loans for house purchase, which once again saw 
stronger demand quarter on quarter. These benefited from a further decline in lending 
rates and brisk demand for housing. Responses from the banks surveyed in the  BLS
generally confirm this assessment. Their feedback indicated that household demand 
for loans for house purchase increased primarily due to the decline in the general level 
of interest rates (see Chart 2.9) and because households remain upbeat about housing 
market prospects, including expected house price developments and expected yields. 
For the first quarter of 2025, the  banks are expecting to see demand for loans for BLS
house purchase increase further, reportedly because real estate prices are still compar-
atively low and demand for housing is strong. 

Monetary policy and banking business
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 61At the same time, the banks in Germany further tightened their credit standards for 
housing loans.  The  banks’ main rationale for tightening their lending policies was BLS
the decline in their risk tolerance and the increased credit risk in business with house-
holds. The more restrictive calibration of lending policies in this loan category is consis-
tent with the current employment expectations of enterprises in Germany. Surveys by 
the Ifo Institute indicate that these expectations deteriorated further in the fourth 
quarter of 2024 owing to the broad-based negative business expectations.
Alongside loans for house purchase, consumer credit to households also recorded 
moderate growth again.  The uptick in demand for consumer credit and other lending 
to households was mainly attributable to spending on durable consumer goods, the BLS
banks reported. Consumer confidence stopped stimulating demand in the fourth 
quarter of 2024, they noted in a departure from their assessment just one quarter 
earlier. At the same time, the  banks further tightened their credit standards in this BLS
loan category as well, judging that households’ creditworthiness had deteriorated.
Banks’ loan business with domestic non-financial corporations, meanwhile, 
remained anaemic on balance in the fourth quarter of 2024.  Unlike in the euro area, 
banks’ lending business in Germany with non-financial corporations was still showing 
no signs of recovery (see Chart 2.10). While banks in Germany significantly expanded 
their long-term loans with maturities of over five years, which are usually in demand 


Monetary policy and banking business
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 62amongst enterprises for investment purposes, banks’ medium-term and short-term 
loans to non-financial corporations shrank by almost just as much on balance. 
Subdued demand overall for loans from non-financial corporations reflects the diffi-
cult economic environment and uncertain economic outlook.  The  banks reported BLS
that they observed a slight net increase in demand for loans to enterprises in the fourth 
quarter of 2024. However, they attributed this increase solely to the decline in the 
general level of interest rates. Meanwhile, the surveyed bank managers judged that 
financing needs for fixed investment had declined, reporting that small and medium-
sized enterprises, in particular, had refrained from submitting loan requests for invest-
ment purposes in the fourth quarter of 2024. For the first quarter of 2025, the  BLS
banks are expecting to see financing needs stagnate in this loan category.
According to BLS data, banks in Germany tightened their credit standards for loans 
to enterprises on balance in the fourth quarter of 2024.  The previous quarter had 
seen them ease their credit standards for loans to enterprises again marginally for the 
first time after a prolonged tightening cycle (see Chart 2.11). The fresh round of tighten-
ing affected all enterprise size categories in equal measure, but differed across 
economic sectors. The most significant adjustments concerned energy-intensive 
manufacturing, construction (excluding real estate) and real estate. The loan rejection 
rate rose again for loans to enterprises, above all for loan requests and applications 
from small and medium-sized enterprises. Some banks reported that borrowers’ credit-


Monetary policy and banking business
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 63worthiness had decreased and that their debt-servicing capacity was becoming increas-
ingly inadequate.
The banks attributed the recent rounds of tightening of their credit standards to 
their lower risk tolerance and the increased credit risk.  This assessment related not 
only to the subdued general economic situation and outlook but also to industry-spe-
cific and firm-specific factors. The banks reported, furthermore, that regulatory and 
supervisory requirements, particularly those surrounding the implementation of the 
Basel III reform package, also played a role in the tightening of credit standards over 
the past 12 months. Moreover, the banks reported that the ratio of non-performing 
loans, including further indicators of credit quality, had had a restrictive effect on the 
credit standards for loans to enterprises in the second half of 2024. 
For the first quarter of 2025, the BLS banks are planning to tighten their credit 
standards further, citing changing regulatory and supervisory requirements, 
amongst other things, as the reason for this.  This is likely to be a reflection, in particu-
lar, of the new rules governing the calculation of risk-weighted assets  under the ( ) RWAs
Basel III reform package. Published in June 2024, this package is made up of the 
revised Capital Requirements Regulation  and the revised Capital Requirements ( )CRR
Directive  Meanwhile, the  banks reported that changes in the excess liquidity ( ). CRD BLS
held with the Eurosystem are not expected to affect banks’ lending over the next six 
months, as was the case in the previous half-year.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 661 Financial market environment
Financial markets were shaped by considerably higher long-term interest rates, a 
progressing disinflation process in the euro area and dwindling expectations of 
policy rate cuts, especially in the United States.  Market participants revised their 
expectations regarding policy rates in the euro area for 2025 slightly upwards. 
However, they continue to expect money market rates to fall noticeably and the degree 
of monetary policy restriction to ease as the year goes on. Surveys as well as market 
data point to the inflation target being reached in the medium term. Expectations of 
interest rate cuts in connection with  monetary policy fell much more sharply. The US
disinflation process has proven to be comparatively slow, especially in the United 
States. More recently, market participants expected for 2025 that the  would make Fed
only one further interest rate cut. 
Yields on ten-year US Treasuries rose sharply on balance – as did yields worldwide. 
Factors contributing to this included growing expectations of inflation in the United 
States, unexpectedly robust growth signals from the  economy, and expected fiscal US
pressures. Concerns as to whether tariffs or the more restrictive immigration policy 
could hamper  growth have thus far receded. Investors also expect, at least in the US
short term, growth stimuli from  fiscal policy, which is likely to result in a sharp US
increase in its debt levels in relation to  The rise was ultimately caused by an GDP .
unusually high increase in term premia. This not only reflected greater optimism 
regarding the  economy, but also renewed uncertainty surrounding inflation devel-US
opments in the United States and the future path of key interest rates. The rise in term 
premia also spread to the yields of ten-year federal bonds (Bunds) and European 
government bonds overall. However, given that expectations regarding monetary 
policy interest rates were revised upwards more significantly for the United States than 
for the euro area, the interest rate differential between the euro area and the United 
States widened noticeably. This was the decisive factor in the euro depreciating signifi-
cantly against the  dollar. Overall, the euro was also effectively down on the curren-US
cies of 18 trading partners in the reporting period; this is likely to be more a reflection 
of a subdued economic picture in Germany. 

Financial markets
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 67With increased investors’ risk appetite and the US economy posting unexpectedly 
positive figures, prices in the international equity markets rose noticeably.  On 
balance, this helped drive up valuations, in particular for  equities. Particularly in US
anticipation of the new  administration’s relaxation of regulations for the financial US
industry, investors expected banks’ high interest margins to persist for some time. The 
value of bank equities rose significantly as a result.

Financial markets
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 682 Exchange rates
The euro depreciated significantly against the US dollar from the end of the third 
quarter of 2024.  For a time it fell to its lowest level since November 2022, trading at US
$1.02. A variety of factors contributed to the depreciation of the euro: first, the 
economic policy plans of the newly elected  President Trump boosted the  dollar. US US
Mr Trump pledged to pursue a more expansionary fiscal policy and a more restrictive 
immigration policy. Furthermore, alongside the additional tariffs on the  which were EU,
announced for aluminium and steel at the start of February, he also threatened impos-
ing broad-based tariff increases. All of these measures have the tendency to drive up 
inflation in the United States. Accordingly, market-based inflation expectations, and 
thus also interest rate expectations, rose after the election result became public. The 
resulting widening of the interest rate differential with the euro area caused the euro 
to depreciate. A second key reason for the weakness of the euro against the  dollar US
was the continuing surprisingly robust economic developments in the United States. 
For example, an unexpected increase in demand for labour was reported at the start of 
December. The Federal Reserve responded to these events by cutting interest rates by 
25 basis points at its December meeting, while also signalling a slower pace of 
monetary policy easing for the course of 2025. This exerted additional appreciation 
pressure on the  dollar. A third factor that intensified this appreciation pressure US
relative to the euro came in the form of expected signs of an upturn in the euro area 
which failed to materialise. This fuelled the view among market participants that the 
Eurosystem’s monetary policy could prove to be more expansionary than previously 
thought, thus putting pressure on the euro. As this report went to press, the euro was 
trading at $1.04, down 6.7 % on its level at the end of the third quarter of 2024.US

Financial markets
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 69The euro depreciated against the pound sterling from the end of the third quarter 
of 2024.  In October, the euro temporarily gained ground against the pound sterling 
after the  government announced higher levels of new borrowing for 2025. The euro UK
appreciated more significantly at the start of the new year, but this also proved to be 
just a temporary development after it was reported that international investors were 
selling  government bonds on a net basis amid renewed concerns about the ’s UK UK
fiscal situation and growth prospects. More recently, both the  and the euro area UK
have seen interest rates decline across all maturities. As the fall in interest rates was 
somewhat more pronounced in the euro area, the interest rate differential widened at 
the euro area’s expense. This caused the euro to depreciate, leading it stand at £0.83 
most recently, which was 0.9 % lower than at the end of September 2024.
On balance, the euro lost value against the yen due to the narrowing interest rate 
differential between the two currency areas.  The euro was buoyed against the yen by 
concerns regarding Japan’s economic outlook. This was fuelled by political uncertainty 
in Japan in the wake of the country’s parliamentary elections, and by international 
uncertainties stemming, for example, from the new administration in the United States. 
In light of this, the Bank of Japan did not raise key interest rates in December. Market 
participants interpreted this decision as a sign that the Bank of Japan might not further 
scale back its exceptionally expansionary monetary policy any time soon. This briefly 


Financial markets
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 70put pressure on the yen. However, the publication of unexpectedly high inflation 
figures brought this trend to an end. The yen has once again been experiencing a 
period of appreciation since the Bank of Japan raised key interest rates further at the 
end of January in response to higher wage agreements. With the  Governing ECB
Council lowering key interest rates in the euro area over the same period, the interest 
rate differential on one-year monetary policy-driven interest rates between the euro 
area and Japan narrowed by around 15 basis points. This put pressure on the euro. On 
balance, it depreciated by 2.0 % against the yen and recently stood at 157¥.
The effective depreciation of the euro against 18 currencies has boosted Germany’s 
price competitiveness.  In a weighted average against 18 trading partners, the euro’s 
effective exchange rate declined by 2.7 % compared with the end of the third quarter of 
2024. This was largely due to the marked depreciation against the  dollar mentioned US
above. A further major factor in the effective weakness of the euro was its noticeable 
depreciation vis-à-vis the renminbi (-3.4 %). Therefore, the price competitiveness of 
Germany and the euro area has improved since the end of September 2024. At present, 
the euro area’s relative price level is significantly below the level that would be 
expected based on its relative productivity level. Thus, based on the productivity 
approach and compared to a broad group of countries, the price competitiveness of 
the euro area is deemed favourable. This tends to apply to Germany again now, too. 
Compared with much of 2024, when Germany’s price competitiveness as measured 
using this approach fell to a neutral level at times, this constitutes a recovery. By 


Financial markets
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 71contrast, a longer-term comparison with the period from 2015 to 2022 indicates a 
moderate deterioration in Germany's price competitiveness. The supplementary infor-
mation below demonstrates that the development of non-price factors relating to 
Germany’s competitiveness is much more serious, however.

Financial markets

Germany’s price and non-price competitiveness – status 
quo and developments
The Bundesbank continuously assesses the price competitiveness position of 57 
countries using an indicator of price competitiveness based on the productivity 
approach.  This takes into account the empirically valid and positive relationship 
between a country’s relative productivity level and its relative price level according to 
the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis.  Taking into account the country’s geographical 
competitive structure in export markets, a benchmark value for the relative price level 
can be calculated for each country, at which its price competitiveness would be neutral. 
If the actual relative price level significantly exceeds this benchmark value, the price 
competitiveness position of the country in question is deemed to be unfavourable. 1) 
 2) 
1 According to the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis, countries with a high productivity level pay comparatively 
high wages in the tradeable goods sector. However, these relatively high wages are also paid in the non-trade-
able goods sector because both sectors compete for labour. Higher wages thus result in a higher price level 
(based on higher non-tradeable goods prices) relative to countries with lower productivity. However, this does 
not influence a country’s international price competitiveness, as the prices of internationally traded goods are 
decisive in this regard. For information on deriving the effect of macroeconomic productivity shifts under the 
Balassa-Samuelson model, see Fischer and Hossfeld (2014).

Financial markets
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 73The Bundesbank indicator classifies Germany’s price competitiveness for 2024 as 
neutral, and even trending somewhat more positively of late on account of the 
recent effective depreciation of the euro  (see Chart 3.3). However, these indicator 
values are markedly worse than those seen from 2015 to 2022, when Germany 
recorded fairly favourable price competitiveness. If a ranking of the countries based on 
their indicator values is compiled, this, too, shows a moderate deterioration in Germany’
s ranking since 2015.
The World Competitiveness Ranking of the Institute for Management Development (
IMD ) represents an alternative competitiveness indicator.  It classifies 67 countries 
on the basis of 256 sub-indicators, which are divided into the four categories of 
"Economic Performance", "Government Efficiency", "Business Efficiency", and "Infras-
tructure". Two-thirds of the sub-indicators are derived from statistical data and one-
third from surveys of managers. However, the number of businesses surveyed (on 
average around 100 per country) is small compared with other business surveys, such 
as the Bundesbank Online Panel surveys or the  Business Climate Index. In addition, ifo
the details of the weighting scheme of the overall indicator are not publicly known and 
it is not derived theoretically such as in the case of the price competitiveness indicator. 
The heterogeneous data basis of the  indicator, which also includes non-price IMD
factors such as policy measures, infrastructure and education, means that this indicator 


Financial markets
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 74defines the term “competitiveness” very broadly. Compared with the Bundesbank 
indicator, this makes it more difficult for it to be interpreted on the one hand, but 
makes it possible to take a more comprehensive view of Germany’s competitiveness on 
the other.
According to the IMD  indicator, Germany’s competitiveness position has deterio-
rated significantly over the past decade, from a top-ranking position in 2014 (6th) to 
only a middle-ranking position in 2024  (see Chart 3.3). Germany’s ranking saw a partic-
ularly significant decline from 2014 to 2019 and then again from 2022 according to the
. In a direct comparison with the indicator of price competitiveness, both indicators IMD
point to negative developments in Germany’s competitiveness since 2022 (see Chart 
3.4). Between 2014 and 2019, however, the indicators diverged markedly, as Germany’s 
price competitiveness, in contrast to the  indicator, initially improved during this IMD
period and then remained at a favourable level.

Financial markets
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 75Germany’s competitiveness deteriorated only moderately overall as a result of price 
components; this is shown by both the Bundesbank’s price competitiveness indica-
tor and the price-related sub-indicators of the IMD  approach.  Furthermore, the 
deterioration in the  price indicators began in the period from 2022, thus reflecting, IMD
amongst other things, the negative impact of Russia’s war of aggression against 
Ukraine on the German economy. This is in line with the result mentioned above that, 
according to the Bundesbank indicator, the decline in price competitiveness is only 
moderate and focuses on the years from 2022. Only in the case of the “  inflation HICP


Financial markets
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 76rate” sub-indicator does the  show a more significant decline in Germany’s ranking IMD
since 2022. The comparatively unfavourable inflation developments in Germany reflect, 
amongst other things, the rise in energy prices driven by the war.
Germany’s losses are more striking in the case of non-price factors than for price 
factors, especially when looking at survey-based sub-indicators of the IMD  ranking.  
For instance, numerous values determined from business surveys can be found among 
the sub-indicators with the most unfavourable developments for Germany recorded 
since 2014. In the category “Business Efficiency”, for example, Germany’s ranking 
dropped from a top position to a middle-ranking one regarding several questions, such 
as whether large enterprises operate efficiently by international standards, whether 
Germany’s image promotes the country as a business location, whether social values 
are conducive to international competition, and whether entrepreneurship is 
widespread. In the categories “Infrastructure” and “Government Efficiency”, the sub-in-
dicators with the most unfavourable developments include those based on business 
surveys, such as the assessment of legal frameworks for technical progress, incentives 
for international investors, or bureaucracy. Germany’s digital competitiveness has also 
deteriorated since 2014 according to the ’s separately calculated World Digital IMD
Competitiveness Ranking, which is also largely attributable to survey indicators. Yet, a 
closer look reveals that survey-based sub-indicators of competitiveness fluctuate a 
great deal more strongly in the  ranking than those based on statistical surveys. For IMD
example, the standard deviation of the average ranking for Germany based on sub-indi-
cators derived from statistics is 4.7 ranking positions, while the value for survey-based 
sub-indicators is 7.4 ranking positions.  This could be indicative of survey-based sub-in-
dicators currently overstating the actual deterioration. 
All in all, it can thus be said that the IMD  indicator as a whole points to significant 
losses in Germany regarding non-price aspects of competitiveness, while Germany’s 
price competitiveness has deteriorated only moderately compared with the average 
since 2015.  The analysis does not distinguish between structural and cyclical competi-
tiveness factors. However, the long-term negative developments in the  indicator, IMD
particularly in the area of non-price factors, suggest structural problems in Germany. 3)

4 The standard deviation is a measure of the fluctuation range of ranking positions over time. For the average 
ranking of sub-indicators derived from statistics, this means specifically that two-thirds of all of Germany’s 
rankings over time fall within the interval of [22‑4.7; 22+4.7], with a value of 22 representing the long-term 
average of this ranking.

3.1 Bond market
US government bond yields rose sharply on the back of a surprisingly positive 
economic outlook and dwindling expectations of policy rate cuts.  Since the end of 
September 2024, a number of indicators have been published that paint a surprisingly 
positive picture of the  economy. Market participants also assessed the new  US US
administration’s economic agenda as being generally conducive to  growth (see also US
the " " and " " sections above). Taken Financial market environment Exchange rates
together, these assessments resulted in higher real interest rates. Concerns were also 
observed among market participants that the disinflation process could slow down 
significantly. This was reflected in the sharp increase in ten-year market-based inflation 
expectations for the United States. Against this backdrop, market participants also 
revised their expectations for the future interest rate path of the  upwards. This was Fed
also largely driven by the Fed’s decisions. The Federal Reserve lowered its policy rates 
again in December 2024, while simultaneously making it clear that it would be slowing 
down the monetary policy normalisation process, and left policy rates unchanged in 
January. Most recently, the yield on ten-year  Treasuries stood 74 basis points higher US
than the level recorded at the beginning of the fourth quarter. 

Financial markets
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 78The increase in US yields was largely due to a higher term premium, but also to 
diminishing expectations of interest rate cuts.  Term premia constitute the premium 
that investors receive when they hold longer-dated bonds instead of short-dated 
money market paper, which they invest in on a revolving basis. These premia reflect 
the uncertainty and risk inherent in future interest rates and future economic condi-
tions that are unknown at present. Depending on the economic situation, term premia 
may be positive or negative.  The sharp rise in the premium to its current level was 
due primarily to two factors. First, market participants saw a renewed risk of increased 
inflation in the United States. Higher-than-expected inflation erodes the purchasing 
power – i.e. the real value – of a ten-year bond at maturity. Investors demand compensa-
tion for taking on this inflation risk. The inflation risk premium and uncertainty 
surrounding the future development of key interest rates increased. Second, market 
participants are taking a more optimistic view of real  economic growth. Lower US
downside risks imply that short-term real interest rates are more likely to move 
upwards. This decreases the real insurance value of long-dated bonds against real 
income losses. It is more favourable for investors to increase their real consumption 
over the term of the bond. This declining real insurance value of ten-year bonds in itself 
 1)

Financial markets
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 79also results in rising interest rates. It is this real component of the term premium, in 
particular, that has been rising in recent months. Revised expectations with regard to 
key interest rates also played a part in the rise in ten-year yields. At the end of the 
reporting period, the majority of market participants were only expecting one interest 
rate cut for the current year, thus 100 basis points lower than at the end of the third 
quarter of 2024.  
Rising term premia in the United States had a significant impact on yields in the 
euro area in the reporting period.  International capital markets are linked via a more 
or less close interest rate relationship. A real increase in the burden on the capital 
markets by the world’s largest economy will inevitably have a real impact on the rest of 
the world. This relationship can be understood by observing the current situation with 
the term premium. The term premium on ten-year Bunds also rose significantly by 24 
basis points, albeit not as sharply as the term premium for matched-maturity  US
Treasuries. Since the ten-year Bund is the benchmark bond for the euro area, and thus 
a key reference for the prices of other euro area government bonds, yields on these 
bonds also rose above the term premium.  
The expected development of policy rates in the euro area decoupled from that in 
the United States.  At its meetings in October, December and January, the  Govern-ECB
ing Council cut its policy rates by 25 basis points on each occasion, thus reducing the 
degree of its monetary policy tightening further and more sharply than the By Fed. 


Financial markets
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 80contrast, the future path of key interest rates for the euro area expected by the market 
shifted upwards only slightly. Market participants continue to anticipate a marked 
decline in money market rates over the course of 2025. For example, calculated on the 
basis of money market rates  the expected deposit facility rate for mid-2025 ( ), €STR
most recently stood at approximately 2.2 %, which is around 55 basis points lower than 
its current level. This reflects the view of market participants that the disinflation 
process in the euro area is progressing. Concurrently, this also reflected the fact that 
the expected signs of an upturn in the euro area failed to materialise and the indicators 
as a whole pointed to surprisingly weak economic growth in the euro area. 
Against this backdrop, yields on ten-year Bunds did not rise as sharply as those in 
the United States. However, due to the comparatively strong contraction in scarcity 
premia, they increased more than yields in other euro area countries.  The spread of 
the  -weighted average of ten-year government bond yields of other euro area GDP
countries narrowed by 13 basis points against Bunds with the same maturities. The 
marked increase in Bund yields of 41 basis points on balance compared with the rest of 
the euro area also reflected the discontinuation of the monetary policy asset purchase 
programmes. The Eurosystem no longer reinvests the principal payments from matur-
ing Bunds. This is gradually changing the investor structure: the volume of federal 
securities in free float is growing, thus reducing the scarcity of these securities. These 
structural shifts are reflected in diminishing scarcity premia, particularly those paid on 
safe Bunds. This effect is amplified by the fact that investors' risk appetite has grown, 
which has curbed demand for default-free federal securities. On balance, the rise in 
yields on ten-year Bunds was influenced above all by the developments in the United 
States described above. However, the latest rise in yields following the Munich Security 
Conference is also likely to be linked to the expectation of higher levels of defence 
spending in the  which, from the market’s perspective, will increase the fiscal EU,
burden.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 81Ten-year UK and Japanese government bonds mirrored movements in US Treasuries 
during the period under review.  On balance, yields on  gilts were up 62 basis points UK
on their level from the start of October, while yields on Japanese government bonds 
were 59 basis points higher. After the first interest rate cut in August, the Bank of 
England lowered its key interest rate by a further 25 basis points in November and in 
February, respectively. By contrast, the Bank of Japan raised its key interest rate again 
by 25 basis points in January after having tightened its monetary policy in July (see the “
” section). This was in response to the continued rise in domestic infla- Exchange rates
tionary pressure. Thus, key interest rates in Japan are now the highest they have been 
in the past 17 years. 


Financial markets
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 82Market-based inflation indicators continued to move towards the Eurosystem’s 
projection for 2025, while virtually showing no change for 2026 and 2027.  Market-
based inflation expectations calculated on the basis of euro area inflation swaps rose 
steeply by 56 basis points for 2025. The main reason for this was the publication of 
higher-than-expected inflation data at the end of October. In addition, higher oil and 
gas prices around the turn of the year fuelled rising inflation expectations for the year 
ahead. Market-based inflation expectations for 2026 fell slightly by 7 basis points, while 
they rose by 3 basis points for 2027. From the market perspective, downside inflation 
risks were increasingly dominant factors for the years 2026 and 2027. By contrast, the 
experts participating in the Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted by the  ECB
expect inflation risks to be tilted slightly to the upside due to mounting geopolitical 
tensions.  These differences in the risk assessments of the impact of a more restrictive
 trade policy on inflation reflect the high level of uncertainty that market partici-US

Financial markets
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 83pants are faced with. The impact of a potential hike in import prices due to the 
expected tariff increases combined with a weak euro exchange rate needs to be 
weighed against a deteriorating growth outlook. Overall, however, both market partici-
pants and survey respondents expect euro area inflation to return close to the Eurosys-
tem’s inflation target. 
Market-based inflation expectations and surveys point to firmly anchored expecta-
tions at the level of the stability objective . The five-year forward inflation rate five 
years ahead remained almost unchanged from the end of the third quarter, and was 
thus aligned with the target at around 2.1 %. Similarly, the longer-term survey-based 
inflation expectations for the euro area from Consensus Economics, collected on a 
quarterly basis, remained at the 2 % inflation target in January.
Yields on European corporate bonds in the non-speculative segment remained 
nearly unchanged in the context of increased risk appetite among market partici-
pants, while yields on high-yield bonds fell significantly.  Yields on BBB-rated corpo-
rate bonds with residual maturities of between seven and ten years fell slightly for 
financial corporations, while they rose marginally for non-financial corporations. Since 
the yields of German federal securities with the same maturities rose sharply, the yield 
spreads narrowed considerably. Yields on high-yield bonds declined noticeably by 27 
basis points in the period under review due to increased risk appetite, a development 
which also manifested in lower credit default premia for all relevant bond classes. 
Overall, the financing costs of European firms, as measured by yield spreads, were 
recently below their corresponding five-year averages irrespective of their credit quality 
ratings.

year, it too rallied strongly, closing the year with total gains of 7.8 %. In the United 
States, the economic revival that many investors had been anticipating was the main 
factor fuelling the rise in prices. This was reflected not only in unexpectedly robust  US
economic data, but also in a positive start to the reporting season for  corporations US
and growing risk appetite. Prompted by favourable economic signals from the United 
States, interest rates rose sharply around the world, especially in the United States (see 

Financial markets
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 84the “ ” section above). Taken in isolation, an increase in interest rates Bond market
weighs on equities because it reduces the present value of future profits. Ultimately, 
the increase in interest rates had only a temporary effect on the upward trend of the
 500. However, some  technology stocks fell significantly for a time during the S&P US
period under review when a Chinese company unveiled a surprisingly efficient based AI-
language model. As a result,  technology sector stocks posted relatively small gains, US
thereby curbing the market’s overall performance. In the euro area, weak economic 
activity and uncertainty about future trade barriers initially weighed on equity prices, 
which was reflected in lower profit expectations. These developments had a particularly 
strong adverse effect on the chemicals and automotive sectors. At the turn of the year, 
prices picked up across virtually all sectors as risk appetite improved. One reason for 
this may be that, for a time, market participants began to hope that tariffs imposed by 
the United States would be lower than expected overall, and that the previously 
announced special tariffs on aluminium and steel would not escalate into a full-scale 
trade conflict. In addition, European and German indices also comprise equities of 
technology companies which, in contrast to the United States, recorded disproportion-
ately large gains. European technology firms are likely to have benefited particularly 
strongly from interest rates rising less sharply in the euro area. Against this backdrop, 
German equity prices  saw a strong increase (13.3 %), with prices temporarily ( ) CDAX
reaching new record levels. Equity prices in the  as measured by the  100 index, UK, FTSE
gained 5.2 % in value. Japanese equities (Nikkei index) recorded a slight increase in 
prices of 2 % during the period under review. 
Stocks of banks and other financial services providers in Europe and the United 
States recorded larger price increases than their respective overall markets.  Equity 
prices of  banks posted particularly strong gains following the  presidential US US
election. This was helped, in part, by the new administration's pledge to roll back some 
of the regulations governing the financial industry and to cut corporate taxes. In mid-
December, bank shares on both sides of the Atlantic were given an additional boost 
when the Federal Reserve tamped down investors’ expectations of further interest rate 
cuts. This nurtured the prospect of high interest margins persisting and was reflected 
in higher earnings expectations. In addition, positive quarterly results for a number of
 banks buoyed investor optimism. In the euro area, bank equity prices also benefit-US
ted from expectations of high dividend pay-outs and share buy-backs, as well as signs 
that the mergers and acquisitions business could be recovering. European and  bank US
equity prices rose by 20.9 % and 21.6 %, respectively.
European and US equity valuations have continued to rise since the end of Septem-
ber.  This is indicated by the decline in earnings yields over the next 12 months in both 

Financial markets
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 85currency areas, as well as by the narrowing of the respective equity risk premia, which 
can be calculated using a dividend discount model and also take into account the 
medium-term earnings outlook. The lower equity risk premia offset the rise in risk-free 
interest rates, meaning that the implied cost of equity remained unchanged on 
balance. This suggests that valuations for European and  equities have increased and US
are also above their long-term averages and remain high, particularly in the United 
States.

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 881 Economic output declined in the fourth quarter
German economic output fell surprisingly significantly in the fourth quarter of 2024.  
According to the flash estimate of the Federal Statistical Office, seasonally adjusted real
 recorded a quarter-on-quarter decline of 0.2 %.  This represents a slight GDP
downward revision to an initial estimate published previously.  The Federal Statistical 
Office cited significantly lower exports as a major drag on the economy, while private 
and government consumption expenditure rose.  Private consumption benefited from 
substantially higher wages. The labour market outlook deteriorated, however. This 
contributed to the high level of uncertainty among consumers and thus dampened 
private consumption. Industrial output continued to decline, while construction proba-
bly stagnated. The high economic policy uncertainty and now very low capacity utilisa-
tion continued to weigh on investment and thus domestic demand for capital goods 
and construction work. In view of the deteriorated competitive position, German indus-
try was unable to benefit from the growing foreign sales markets. The persistently 
elevated financing costs probably also dampened investment. 1)

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 902 Exports and industrial activity remain a concern
Industrial output declined in the fourth quarter, driven by the automotive industry 
and energy-intensive sectors.  Industrial output fell strongly in December in seasonally 
adjusted terms. Weak motor vehicle production was the main driver.  Taking the 
average of the fourth quarter, industrial output was also significantly lower than in the 
previous quarter. This was mainly due to energy-intensive economic sectors and the 
production of motor vehicles. Excluding these two areas, production would have 
increased slightly. A positive development was observed in the production of electrical 
equipment and data processing equipment, for example, as well as in other transport 
equipment, which has been expanding steadily for a few years now. In the fourth 
quarter, industrial output overall was therefore as yet unable to benefit from the stabili-
sation of new orders. Excluding volatile large orders, new orders have risen slightly 
since the second quarter of 2024. Nonetheless, demand for German industrial products 
remains weak. According to a survey conducted by the  Institute, at the beginning of ifo
the fourth quarter, the shortage of orders in the manufacturing sector stood at its 
highest level since the 19 crisis and fell only slightly in January. This is reflected COVID -
in significant underutilisation of capacity in the industrial sector. According to surveys 
carried out by the  Institute, capacity utilisation has been declining since ifo
October 2022 – albeit only marginally of late. It is now quite considerably below its long-
term average. 
In line with weak industrial activity, exports also decreased again in the fourth 
quarter.  In particular, fewer capital goods such as motor vehicles were exported. The 
fact that German exports are profiting so little from the currently moderate growth in 
global trade is mainly due to the considerable deterioration in German enterprises’ 
competitive position outside and within the  in recent years. As measured by a EU
survey conducted by the  Institute, this trend could even have intensified further in ifo
the fourth quarter. 4) 
4 According to  figures already available for January, the number of passenger cars produced rose steeply VDA
again at the beginning of the year. In view of the weak order situation, some manufacturers may have used 
the Christmas period for extended plant shutdowns. 

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 91Business investment in machinery and equipment is likely to have more or less 
stagnated in the fourth quarter.  On the one hand, domestic sales of capital goods 
producers increased significantly in price-adjusted terms compared with the previous 
quarter. On the other hand, price-adjusted capital goods imports declined significantly. 
Given the very low utilisation rate in industry, still elevated financing costs and high 
economic policy uncertainty, there is no sign of a rapid recovery in investment activity.

Climate-related future additional investment in Germany 
according to business surveys 
The transition to a net-zero economy requires considerable investment in the 
capital stock in Germany.  A study carried out by consultancy firm Prognos estimates 
that additional investment of around €130 billion (just under 4 % of  per year is GDP )
required in Germany up to 2045 if climate neutrality is to be achieved.  Taken in isola-
tion, such an increase in investment would strengthen the economy’s capital stock. 
However, this could be counteracted by the fact that climate policy measures mean that 
emission-intensive capital is, in some cases, written off prematurely (stranded assets). If 
climate policy measures such as carbon pricing cause a significant increase in energy 
costs, they could also act as a negative supply shock and dampen production and 
investment.  In addition, climate change itself can likewise affect the capital stock, for 
example through more frequent extreme weather events. Business surveys provide 
information on whether the additional investment needs calculated in the studies are in 
fact reflected in firms’ investment expectations. 
A representative online survey of more than 5,800 firms conducted by the Bundes-
bank provides information on what domestic additional investment and growth in 
domestic fixed assets can be expected as a result of climate-related developments.
Additional investment related to climate change covers both the needs arising from 
global warming or more frequent extreme weather events and the adjustments that  1)

 4) 1 See Prognos et al. (2024). A previous study commissioned by  calculates additional investment of around KfW
€70 billion (2 % of  per year up to 2045 (see Brand et al. (2021). The significant discrepancy in the amounts is GDP )
due to different definitions of additional investment. In Brand et al. (2021), any climate action investment that 
was planned anyway at the time of the study is factored out of additional investment. In the study by Kemmler 
et al. (2024), additional investment corresponds to total climate action investment. It is calculated as invest-
ment that would not be made without climate action (additional investment compared with conventional fossil 
reference technologies). 
2 From a conceptual perspective, an increase in the emissions price acts as a cost shock for emission-intensive 
firms. Unless passed on fully to customers, higher energy costs reduce the funds available to firms for invest-
ment.

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 93climate policy is likely to trigger.  The questions were asked for two reference periods 
in order to distinguish between short-term and medium-term expectations (up to 2026 
and beyond). The survey was conducted in the first quarter of 2024.
According to the survey results, most firms do not expect domestic investment to 
decline due to climate change.  More than two-fifths of firms expect investment to 
remain virtually unchanged and more than two-fifths expect it to rise between 2027 
and 2029, while less than one-fifth expect a decline. The outlook for the earlier period 
2024 to 2026 is quite similar.
In terms of the value of domestic fixed assets, firms’ expectations of climate-related 
changes are generally fairly balanced.  Just under one-quarter of firms expect positive 
and one-quarter expect negative effects between 2027 and 2029. The majority expect 
small changes. Again, a comparison with the period 2024 to 2026 yields no major differ-
ences. The fact that many firms expect additional investment but not higher fixed 
assets suggests that these investments are often replacement investments.
 4) 
4 The reference is a fictitious scenario without climate change and without climate policy. Firms perceive 
planned investment expenditure as a nominal variable. The difference between the investment plans in the 
two scenarios, as asked here, can be interpreted as a real variable if firms implicitly make similar assumptions 
about how capital goods prices will develop in both scenarios.

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 94Weighting the data by sales shows a much more positive picture as regards 
additional investment.  There are significant differences between the sectors in some 
cases. Larger firms tend to expect greater additional investment and thus a stronger 
increase in their fixed assets. Climate-related developments could therefore well be 
important from a macroeconomic perspective. 
The survey results can be used to make a rough calculation of the expected macro-
economic and sectoral impact.  According to these rough calculations based on the 
sales-weighted results, climate-related developments would lead to additional invest-
ment of around 6.3 % between 2027 and 2029. The energy sector expects the highest 
cumulative rate of change in investment, followed by firms in the waste management 
and water supply industries. In manufacturing and transportation and storage, the 
reported impact is also above average, while in other sectors it is somewhat lower. 
These sectoral results appear plausible, as they reflect, for example, the increased 
investment needs in the energy sector in connection with the expansion of renewable 
energies.
 5) 
5 For 2024 to 2026, firms expect a slightly weaker increase in investment (4.8 % in cumulative terms), while the 
sectoral distribution is similar.

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 95Firms’ fixed assets could also benefit from climate-related developments in sales-
weighted terms.  The expected increase in the value of fixed assets in the corporate 
sector as a whole amounts to around 1.4 % between 2027 and 2029. Sectoral differ-
ences are large here as well, however. According to the survey results, climate-related 
developments could therefore also have a significant impact on the capital stock.
Taken in isolation, climate-related developments could increase potential output by 
strengthening capital input.  If the sales-weighted averages are interpreted as 
expected climate-related changes in the aggregate capital stock, this would result in a 
cumulative increase of 1.4 % (or 0.5 % per year) in the capital stock. Growth in potential 
output would thus be around 0.6 % stronger (or 0.2 % per year).
The impact of climate-related developments on potential output is highly uncertain, 
however.  In view of the currently weak investment environment, partly brought about 
by ambiguous economic policy conditions, it is unclear whether the expectations 
expressed in the survey will materialise. This is also likely to depend on how consis-
tently and comprehensively the necessary economic policy measures are implemented. 
Moreover, there is no clear evidence in the literature to date that a carbon pricing 
policy offers sufficient incentives for environmentally friendly investment. This would 
help to cushion the potentially negative effects associated with higher energy prices 
during the transition. It is also not clear how climate-related developments affect 
productivity growth. For example, the new low-emission parts of the capital stock could 
be more or less productive than the part of the capital stock they replace.  6) 
6 Slightly lower cumulated growth of 1 % is expected in the shorter term (2024 to 2026).

Impact of the weather on sectoral value added
Due to climate change, the impact of unusual weather conditions on economic activ-
ity is gaining in importance for economic analysis.  Germany has experienced more 
and more frequent weather anomalies in recent years.  The official seasonal adjust-
ment process does not filter out deviations from typical seasonal weather from the 
time series for economic indicators.  Unseasonal weather is therefore a special factor 
that can cause economic activity to fluctuate in the short term. Findings in the literature 
suggest that different weather factors, such as temperature or rainfall, have an impact 
on the economy.  The Bundesbank’s economic analysis already incorporates the 
number of icy days as a weather variable.  Based on previous and expected unusual 
weather conditions, other weather variables could improve economic assessments.  
The Bundesbank’s survey of firms ( - BOP F) provides detailed insights into which 
weather factors play a role for German enterprises.  In the fourth quarter of 2024, 
firms were asked, amongst other things, how unusual weather-related factors affect 
their business activity.   1)

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 98According to the survey, temperature and rainfall – usual or unusual – have an 
impact on firms’ production or business activity most often.  The survey contains 
questions on the impact of ten weather-related factors on German enterprises.  As 
those impacts can vary depending on the season, the survey asked about summer and 
winter months separately. Around one-quarter of firms stated that the temperature 
had an impact on their production or business activity. The second most frequently 
cited weather-related factor was rainfall (22 %). Wind force was the third most common 
factor in the winter months (10 %). In the summer months, by contrast, solar radiation 
and hours of sunshine played a greater role, indicated by almost 20 % of the surveyed 
firms. The weather-related factors of soil moisture, river levels, air pressure, humidity 
and air quality were significantly less relevant for the enterprises. The construction 
sector came up most frequently (20 % to 35 %) among the firms which generally ascribe 
an impact on their production to weather-related factors.  7) 
7 The ten weather-related factors are temperature, rainfall, soil moisture, wind force, solar radiation, hours of 
sunshine, humidity, air pressure, air quality and river levels.

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 99Agriculture and construction, as well as consumption-related service providers, are 
influenced by the weather relatively frequently.  In agriculture,  all weather-related 
factors have an effect on production throughout the year, including those cited less 
often overall, such as humidity or air pressure. Temperature is the most frequent 
factor. In the summer months, more than half of the agricultural firms surveyed also 
cited solar radiation and hours of sunshine as factors having an effect on production. 
Construction output is most frequently influenced by temperature and rainfall, as 
expected, especially in the winter months. In addition, solar radiation and hours of 
sunshine in the summer months are mentioned relatively often, by around one-third of 
firms. Quite a large number of consumption-related service providers from accommo-
dation and food services and the retail sectors said that weather-related factors had an

8 In this context, the agricultural sector also includes the manufacturing sector “Manufacturing of food 
products” (C10-C12). The two sectors are similar in terms of the impact of weather factors, whereas for the 
other manufacturing sectors only minor effects of weather on production can be identified. 

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 100effect on their business activity. In accommodation and food services, this is especially 
true of the summer months. Factors relating to the sun play an important role in this. 
Manufacturing firms and the rest of the service providers much less frequently 
reported that weather-related factors have an effect on their production.  Even the 
overall most important factor, temperature, was mentioned by less than one-fifth of 
the firms. When broken down by region or firm size, there is no notable difference in 
the results.
Braking effects come mainly from exceptionally high or low occurrences or unpre-
dictability of temperature, rainfall and wind force . Of the firms that saw temperature 
as a relevant factor, 56 % stated that unusually high temperatures dampened produc-

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 101tion in the summer months. That share amounted to 39 % in the winter months. Both 
higher amounts of rainfall and stronger winds than usual affect up to 65 % of the enter-
prises in question throughout the year. Exceptionally low temperatures also impair 
activity for just over one-quarter of those affected in the winter months. The unpre-
dictability of temperature, rainfall and wind force disrupts production for just over one-
fifth of the firms in question. By contrast, up to 63 % of the relevant enterprises gain a 
certain boost from a particularly high number of hours of sunshine. Adverse effects 
from this weather factor are much less frequent.
In summary, the analysis shows that it is important to consider weather factors, 
depending on the season, when assessing the activity of many economic sectors.  It 
demonstrates that temperature and rainfall, in particular, could be used in assessing 
economic developments going forward. 


The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 102In the construction sector, demand, output and probably also investment stabilised.  
Construction investment is likely to have moved sideways at the end of the year after 
two quarters of decline. This is suggested by seasonally adjusted construction output, 
which remained stable overall in the fourth quarter. There are no indications that 
weather conditions had a significant impact for the fourth quarter.  Output in building 
construction and civil engineering rose somewhat again for the first time since the first 
quarter. By contrast, the decline in the finishing trades continued, albeit at a signifi-
cantly slower pace. The construction sector as a whole continues to struggle with weak 
demand, which is well below the highs recorded in 2021. Both new orders and building 
permits recovered somewhat recently, however. Averaged across October and Novem-
ber, real new orders in the main construction sector, for example, rose markedly 
overall compared with the previous quarter. Higher financing costs continue to weigh 
on the sector, especially housing construction. However, the effective rates of interest 
on housing loans fell somewhat in the second half of 2024, reflecting declining 
monetary policy restrictiveness. 
 5) 
5 According to  Institute surveys, the share of firms in the main construction sector reporting that weather ifo
conditions hindered construction activity was only slightly below the previous quarter in seasonally adjusted 
terms. See also the supplementary information on the " ". Impact of the weather on sectoral value added

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 103Private consumption and service providers likely continued to support the economy 
in the fourth quarter.  Private consumption once again benefited from substantial 
wage growth. However, consumers have still been reluctant to make full use of their 
additional spending leeway. In particular, the still subdued outlook in the labour 
market is likely to have contributed to consumer restraint. Nevertheless, fourth-quarter 
indicators paint a fairly positive picture for private consumption and consumer-related 
services sectors overall. Both real sales in retail trade and new passenger car registra-
tions rose in the fourth quarter. There was also no further decline in price-adjusted 
sales in accommodation and food services. The continuing weakness in industry should 
likewise have had a less negative impact on the services sector in the fourth quarter 
than in the previous two quarters. This is indicated by real wholesale sales which were 
markedly higher than the previous quarter’s average. Finally, on an average of October 
and November, the production index for the services sector likewise rose slightly on the 
quarter. Service providers are therefore likely to have supported economic activity.

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 1043 Labour market  stable in  fourth quarter
Employment remained more stable in the fourth quarter than had been expected 
following the decline in the third quarter.  Overall employment remained at the level 
of the previous quarter. Hiring in some services sectors continued to offset the decline 
in employment in the manufacturing sector. Short-time work has risen noticeably since 
the summer holidays. Here, too, industrial jobs are most affected. Unemployment rose 
moderately, and the outlook remains subdued.  
The number of persons in employment rose slightly in seasonally adjusted terms 
over the last quarter of 2024.  This meant that more people were employed in the 
fourth quarter than had been expected in view of the previous decline and the deterio-
ration in sentiment indicators.  On a quarterly average, the employment level of 
46.06 million persons employed was equivalent to that of the third quarter. While the 
decline in self-employment continued, the number of employees rose somewhat. 
Within this group, however, there were fewer people who were only doing a “mini-job”. 
By contrast, the number of employees subject to social security contributions went up 
somewhat according to the Federal Employment Agency’s initial estimates, which reach 
up to November.  6) 
6 In the December 2024 Forecast for Germany, the decline in employment in the third quarter had even been 
expected to strengthen in the short term. However, the figures now published by the Federal Statistical Office 
contain a slight downward revision to the level of employment. Nevertheless, the current level of employment 
exceeds the expected level. 

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 105From a sectoral perspective, the dichotomy between sectors recruiting and those 
laying off existing workers on balance intensified further in the fourth quarter.  
Developments in employment subject to social security contributions in manufacturing 
reflect the difficult structural and economic situation experienced by industry. On an 
average of October and November alone, employment here was almost 0.5 % below 
the previous quarter’s level. Particularly firms in energy-intensive and consumption-re-
lated industries (excluding the pharmaceutical industry) cut jobs. Another factor is the 
decline in the number of temporary workers, who are frequently deployed in the 
manufacturing sector. By contrast, the major industrial sectors – motor vehicle manufac-
turing and mechanical engineering – virtually maintained their staff levels. The fall in 
employment in the construction sector slowed down. Meanwhile, employment in some 
services sectors especially grew at a high pace compared with the summer (at least 
0.5 %). These include health and social services, the public sector, the financial sector, 
energy and water supply, and transportation and logistics. Increased demand for 
demographic reasons, as a result of digitalisation or due to the energy transition, plays 
a role in most cases. Other services sectors kept their headcount largely constant.  


The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 106Increased use of short-time working for economic reasons has been observed since 
the end of the summer holidays.  After remaining at a slightly elevated level since the 
beginning of 2024, the number of short-time workers rose to almost 300,000 up to 
November, according to initial estimates by the Federal Employment Agency. As 
around 85 % of all affected workers are employed in the manufacturing sector, mostly 
in the metals and technology sectors, the short-time working rate in this sector is above 
4 %. The takeup of short-time work has thus risen substantially although it is still far off 
previous crisis levels.  Short-time work continued to be virtually non-existent in the 
rest of the economy. The instrument is primarily used to bridge temporary cyclical falls 
in demand. However, as many firms complain of structural difficulties, short-time work 
is likely not to be a suitable remedy in many cases. 
 7) 
7 In the second quarter of 2009, at the peak of the economic and financial crisis at that time, more than 23 % of 
employees in the metals and technology sector were in short-time work. Back then, the manufacturing sector, 
and in particular the metals and technology sector, were likewise the main users of short-time work for 
economic reasons. The metal and technology area includes the economic activities 24‑30 and 32 and 33 in the
 classification system, which comprises, amongst others, the manufacture of basic metals, machinery and NACE
equipment and motor vehicle manufacturing.

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 107Registered unemployment saw a further slight uptick.  Averaged over the fourth 
quarter of 2024, a seasonally adjusted 2.86 million persons were registered as 
unemployed, around 48,000 more than in the third quarter of 2024. This pushed up the 
unemployment rate by 0.1 percentage point to 6.1 %. Unemployment continued to rise 
moderately by 11,000 persons in January, taking the unemployment rate to 6.2 %. 
Approximately half of the increase in recent months occurred in the statutory 
unemployment insurance scheme, which is subject to cyclical influence. This is 
somewhat less than in the summer half-year. By contrast, the number of unemployed 
persons receiving the basic welfare allowance grew somewhat more strongly than in 
the previous two quarters. This could be linked to the weak economic growth of the 
German economy that has now persisted for some time. With transition rates from 
unemployment to employment currently very low, there is likely to be an increase in 
the number of unemployed persons switching to the basic welfare allowance as 
unemployment insurance entitlements come to an end. This implies the risk of 
unemployment becoming increasingly entrenched. The impact of immigrants on 
unemployment – these individuals mostly end up receiving the basic welfare allowance 
as they are ineligible for insurance benefits – recently played a lesser role. First, 
immigration from abroad declined in 2024, and, second, the efforts to integrate 
refugees are now paying off in rising employment levels.
Although developments in recent months have been more favourable than feared, 
leading indicators do not suggest any improvement in labour market dynamics.  The
 employment barometer, which determines recruitment plans in trade and industry ifo
for the next three months, is well into negative territory, despite an initial increase in 
January. Sentiment continues to be low especially in the manufacturing and trade 
sectors. The ’s labour market barometer for the economy as a whole has gradually IAB
declined in recent months, but still paints a slightly positive picture overall. However, 
the indicator is increasingly approaching the neutral threshold. The number of vacant 
positions reported to the Federal Employment Agency continues to decrease slowly. In 
particular, the agency received only a few new offers for jobs subject to social security 
contributions. All in all, there is little indication that the positive surprises seen in the 
fourth quarter will persist when it comes to employment. Unemployment is also likely 
to continue to rise. As this report went to press, the  unemployment barometer IAB
remained on a downward trajectory. 

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 1084 Wage growth somewhat less strong recently
Growth in negotiated wages was strong in the fourth quarter, albeit somewhat 
weaker than in the third quarter.  Including additional benefits, they were up by a 
substantial 5.8 % on the year in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared with 8.9 % in the 
previous quarter. The high growth in the third quarter had been caused by one-off 
effects stemming from high inflation compensation bonuses and back-payments, partic-
ularly in trade. These no longer had an impact on aggregate negotiated wages in the 
fourth quarter. A different picture emerges when special payments such as inflation 
compensation bonuses  are stripped out of negotiated wages and only basic rates of 
remuneration are considered. In this configuration, negotiated wages in the economy 
as a whole rose by 6.6 % on the year in the fourth quarter, a distinctly stronger increase 
than in the third quarter (5.7 %). 
Negotiated wages once again rose more sharply in services than in manufacturing.  
In many services sectors, it is easier to attain higher wages than in industry and 
construction given the better economic situation combined with rising demand for 
labour. 
In recent times, there have been hardly any new agreements for larger sectors.  
However, a wage agreement was reached at Volkswagen. From an aggregate perspec-
tive, however, it should be seen as a special case affecting just one corporate group 
and hence has no direct signal effect for other sectors. What the agreement does show, 
though, is that unions may be willing to agree to temporary wage losses in exchange 
for protecting jobs when structural changes coincide with an episode of economic 
weakness.  Deutsche Bahn also concluded wage negotiations recently. Its agreement 
with the German Railway and Transport Union entails considerably lower wage 
increases than in the arbitration in August 2023 and an extension to the guarantee of 
job security. It is also striking that wage negotiations are taking longer than usual in  8) 
 9) 
8 The tax and social contribution-free inflation compensation bonuses ceased at the end of December 2024.
9 The negotiating parties agreed to protect the jobs of core staff only. Around 35,000 jobs may be cut up to 2030 
in a socially responsible manner. At the same time, it was agreed that there will be no compulsory redundan-
cies and a roadmap for plant capacities was adopted.

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 109some sectors. In system catering, for example, negotiations have been under way since 
June of last year with no result, and the parties are heading for arbitration. Painters and 
varnishers are also exploring the possibility of mediation after four months of negotia-
tions.  
The 2025 wage round is smaller than the previous year’s and covers around 8 million 
employees.  This year, negotiations are taking place in the public sector , for insurers, 
the steel industry and temporary agency workers, for example. The unions’ current 
wage demands range from 6.5 % (textile and clothing industry in western Germany) to 
19 % (system catering) for a term of 12 months. This is still above average. However, the 
latest wage demands are lower than those made when inflation was peaking. Neverthe-
less, services unions are seeking to compensate for the dampening effect stemming 
from inflation compensation bonuses having ceased in many cases and also to achieve 
additional increases. By contrast, the industrial sector’s current weak spell could 
dampen wage settlements there somewhat. Overall, given the prolonged period of 
economic weakness and significantly lower inflation rates, the forthcoming wage 
negotiations will probably result in distinctly lower agreements than in the past two 
years. 
Actual earnings probably grew a little less strongly in the fourth than in the third 
quarter.  This is indicated by the nominal wage index of the Federal Statistical Office,  
with its annual rate falling from 5.9 % in the third quarter to 5.0 % in the fourth.
Wage growth was once again robust in 2024 as a whole.  Actual earnings were up 
5.3 % on the year, compared with 6.4 % previously, according to preliminary data from 
the Federal Statistical Office. Negotiated wages climbed by as much as 6.1 % in 2024, 
compared with 4.0 % in the previous year. The negative wage drift is reflective of the 
fact that actual earnings increased more rapidly during the period of high inflation and 
negotiated wages are still lagging behind in some cases. Another factor may be that in 
2023 some inflation compensation bonuses and regular wage increases were voluntar-
ily brought forward. This led to negative base effects in 2024.  
The statutory general minimum wage was raised to €12.82 per hour at the begin-
ning of the year (+3.3 %).  The independent Minimum Wage Commission will deliver a  10)

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 1115 Prices moderately higher despite reduced energy costs
Consumer prices (as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, or
HICP ) rose again moderately in the fourth quarter.  On average across the months of 
October to December 2024, consumer prices increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.5 %, 
compared with 0.4 % in the previous quarter. Falling energy prices continued to have a 
dampening effect, even though the decline slowed compared with the third quarter. 
The lower oil price had a significant impact on refined petroleum products in particular. 
By contrast, food price inflation picked up again markedly. Prices of fruit and dairy 
products, in particular, rose substantially. Services prices continued to rise significantly, 
but less sharply than in previous quarters. In the case of non-energy industrial goods, 
however, price inflation saw a distinct uptick again. Annual headline inflation rose by 
0.3 percentage point to 2.5 % in the fourth quarter. Core inflation  excluding (HICP
energy and food) edged up slightly to 3.2 %.
Averaged over 2024, the inflation rate fell significantly to 2.5 %.  In 2023, it had come 
in at 6.0 %. In particular, the upward pressure on goods prices subsided substantially. 
At 2.8 %, the rate of inflation for food was close to the historical average in 2024. Infla-
tion for non-energy industrial goods fell to 1.5 % and likewise approached the historical 
average. Energy actually made a significantly negative contribution to the  rate. HICP
Only services inflation remained unusually high, at 4.3 %, and declined only a little 
compared with 2023. The large wage increases had a particularly strong impact here.
Inflation held steady at 2.8 % in January 2025.  In month-on-month terms, too, 
consumer price inflation continued at the same pace as in December. Energy prices 
increased especially strongly, driven by significantly higher fuel prices. This was due to 
both the increase in the national carbon price as of the beginning of the year and 
higher crude oil prices. The depreciation of the euro against the  dollar further ampli-US
fied the price-driving effect of the higher crude oil prices. This contrasted with a steep 
decline in food prices. Prices of fruit and of meat products were both down consider- 13)

marginally. By contrast, services became markedly more expensive again recently. In 
particular, prices of administered services rose sharply in January. The price increase

Annual core inflation rose somewhat, from 3.3 % in December to 3.6 % in January.
The inflation rate is likely to come down over the next few months, before going 
back up temporarily from the middle of the year.  Services are the main driver of the 
expected disinflation process. This is partly because of lower wage increases. Neverthe-
less, services inflation should remain significantly above average. Prices of non-energy 
industrial goods will rise moderately from today’s perspective. On balance, the disinfla-
tion process is therefore likely to continue for the core inflation rate. By contrast, the 
contribution of energy is likely to pick up again over the course of the year, due, in part, 
to base effects. Food prices are expected to go up significantly due to price develop-
ments at upstream stages and after-effects from the exceptionally large wage 
increases in the retail sector.

House prices in Germany in 2024
House prices stabilised in 2024.  On an annual average, residential real estate prices in 
Germany fell somewhat. As the year progressed, they picked up again following the 
first half of the year, however. Slightly improved financing costs and increased purchas-
ing power gradually started to make purchasing residential property more attractive 
again. Households increasingly benefited from rising incomes, and employment picked 
up, whilst inflation eased. In addition, the slowing expansion of supply and the further 
rise in construction prices prevented prices from declining more significantly. Overvalu-
ations were largely eliminated in line with the, on average, lower price level relative to 
the previous year.  
 1) 
1 This section looks at developments in residential property prices in the context of the real economy. For more 
on the financial stability aspects of residential real estate financing, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2024). 

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 114As price developments only started to turn around in the course of the year, prices 
remained below their year-earlier level on an annual average.  According to data 
from the Association of German Pfandbrief Banks  the prices of owner-occupied ( ),vdp
housing fell by 1.6 % in 2024. On average, the Federal Statistical Office’s price index fell 
by 2.8 % in the first three quarters of 2024 compared with the same period of the 
preceding year. Hypoport ’s  price index for residential real estate, which shows AG EPX
price developments turning somewhat earlier, rose by 1.2 % in 2024. 
Residential real estate prices also fell in towns and cities.  Calculations based on 
bulwiengesa  data show that house prices in 127 towns and cities fell by 1.4 % last AG
year. The price decline thus weakened significantly compared with the previous year 
(-4.6 %). In the seven major cities, the decline was 1.8 %.  According to the  index, vdp
prices for owner-occupied housing fell by 1.0 % in the seven major cities.  
Rents for new lettings were raised less dramatically in 2024 than in the preceding 
year.  According to  data, rents for new lettings rose by 5.5 % in Germany. According vdp
to calculations based on data provided by bulwiengesa  rents for new lettings were AG,
up by 3.5 % in towns and cities. They thus appreciated significantly less compared with 
the previous year by both measures. In the seven major cities, the rate of increase in 
rents for new lettings likewise subsided. As a consequence, inflation in rents and infla-
tion in properties for purchase tended to converge as compared with 2023.
Demand for housing remained strong overall despite monetary policy tightening.  
Factors here were the comparatively stable labour market, considerable wage growth 
and declining inflation. The somewhat lower growth in rents should not be interpreted 
as a sign of weaker demand. In actual fact, demand for new housing, which had 
temporarily shifted to the rental market, increasingly reverted to buyer interest as, 
given increasing incomes, slightly improved financing costs and lower inflation, the 
affordability of credit-financed residential property purchases improved. In addition, 
the number of one-person households probably continued to rise, partly as a result of 
demographic factors. 
Transactions in the residential real estate market picked up in 2024.  A newly devel-
oped Bundesbank indicator for transactions in the residential real estate market is 
based on tax revenue from real estate acquisition tax. It is available in a fairly timely  2)

collapsed abruptly after the interest rate hikes in 2022. Market activity was likewise 
exceptionally low in 2023. It has recovered somewhat since the beginning of last year.
Overall, however, the number of residential real estate purchases remained signifi-
cantly lower than during the multi-year upswing in the residential real estate market 
lasting until around 2021‑22. 
The expansion in the supply of housing slowed last year . Construction costs contin-
ued to rise, albeit not as sharply as in the preceding years. With construction prices 
having reached very high levels, investments in additional housing were unprofitable in 
some instances. The number of completed dwellings is likely to have fallen well short of 
the mark of around 300,000 units reached in previous years. This is suggested by the 
fact that there have, for some time now, been a large number of construction project 
cancellations and also by the sharp decline in the order backlog in housing construction.
 New orders did not recover in 2024 from their extremely low level of 2023. In 
addition, construction investment and building permits were roughly as low as at the

The number of approved projects dropped to 215,000 residential units.
Overvaluations of residential real estate in Germany were largely eliminated last 
year.  According to the results of the regionally differentiated panel estimation model, 
residential real estate prices in German towns and cities in 2024 were not far above the 
value that is justified in terms of socio-demographic and economic fundamentals.  
Both the ratio of property purchase prices to annual rents for dwellings in towns and 
cities and the aggregate price-income ratio was less than 15 % above its longer-term 
average. For Germany as a whole, the long-term relationship between real estate 
prices, interest rates and income points to price deviations of less than 10 %.  6)

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 1176 German economy could grow a little in the first quarter
Despite persistently weak underlying economic conditions, German output could 
pick up slightly in the first quarter.  Industry could be less of a drag than before in the 
first quarter and construction could remain at roughly the level of the previous quarter. 
Factors such as high uncertainty, increased financing costs and low capacity utilisation 
are still weighing on investment. However, demand (as measured by order intake) has 
recently recovered somewhat in both sectors. Housing construction benefited from the 
decline in interest rates for building finance up to the end of 2024. Even so, surveys 
conducted by the  Institute on the shortage of orders and equipment utilisation did ifo
not indicate any improvement in January. By contrast, private consumption could 
expand again somewhat: the sharply higher wages offer further scope for additional 
consumer spending. At the same time, the labour market will probably continue to 
cool, with moderately declining employment and a slight rise in unemployment, and 
consumer sentiment remains gloomy. Consumers will therefore probably make only 
hesitant use of this additional scope for spending. Exports have recently been a particu-
lar dampener on economic activity. They may develop somewhat less unfavourably in 
the first few months of the current year. That would be the case, in particular, if they 
were to benefit from anticipatory effects in the face of looming  tariffs. All in all, US
economic output could see marginal growth in the first quarter. The German economy 
essentially remains trapped in stagnation, however. 
Industry could stabilise somewhat in the first quarter given signs of recovery in 
order intake.  Demand for German industrial products remains comparatively weak, 
but its underlying trend has recently recovered somewhat. Averaged over the fourth 
quarter, industrial new orders were stagnant compared with the previous quarter. 
However, excluding volatile large orders, there was an increase in new orders from 
both Germany and abroad. For foreign orders, this was already the third consecutive 
quarter-on-quarter increase. Given that orders are stabilising, capacity utilisation in the 
manufacturing sector declined only marginally in January, according to the  Institute. ifo
In addition, the share of firms reporting a shortage of orders actually dropped slightly. 
At the same time, firms’ assessment of the current situation improved somewhat. 
Business expectations were not any brighter, though. In light of this, industrial output 
looks to be experiencing a sideways movement at best. Motor vehicle production, at

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 118least, is likely to have a dynamic start to the first quarter. Here, data from the German 
Association of the Automotive Industry on the number of passenger cars produced 
indicate a countermovement to the weak output in December.
Private consumption and, above all, service providers are expected to provide 
further support for the economy in the current quarter.  Private consumption contin-
ues to benefit from substantially higher wages. However, consumer sentiment remains 
subdued according to surveys conducted by the market research institute  In GfK.
January, economic and income expectations as well as the propensity to purchase were 
lower than the average of the previous quarter, while the propensity to save was 
stagnant. Motor vehicle registrations by private owners were only at the previous 
quarter’s level in January, according to the German Association of the Automotive Indus-
try. Surveys conducted by the  Institute are also delivering mixed signals for ifo
consumer-related services. While business conditions improved in accommodation and 
food services, they remained unchanged in the retail sector. However, the services 
sector as a whole is likely to continue to support the economy. The  business situa-ifo
tion and, above all, business expectations improved markedly here. In addition,  S&P
Global’s Purchasing Managers’ Index  remained well above the expansion thresh- ( )PMI
old for the services sector and improved to a six-month high in January. 15)

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 1231 General government budget
1.1 2024 result and outlook
According to the preliminary data from January, the general government deficit 
ratio remained unchanged at 2.6 % in 2024.  On the one hand, substantial temporary 
burdens from the energy price brakes were now absent, in contrast to the previous 
year. On the other hand, the fact that some expenditure increased steeply (mainly 
social security funds’ expenses, but also spending on interest, personnel, the promo-
tion of green electricity production under the Renewable Energy Sources Act and the 
armed forces) made the deficit higher. The structural deficit ratio rose substantially on 
the year to around 2 % (see the supplementary information entitled The structural 
.   development of Germany’s government budget in 2024) 1)

The structural development of Germany’s government 
budget in 2024
Germany’s government budget closed 2024 with a deficit of 2.6 % of GDP , matching 
the deficit recorded for 2023  (item 1 in Table 5.1). This supplementary information 
takes a closer look at 2024. For this purpose, the deficit, revenue and expenditure are 
broken down into temporary and structural components. Temporary influences include 
economic activity, crisis measures and other specific one-off effects. The Bundesbank 
uses its own analytical methods and estimates, which means that its structural 
balances differ from those of other institutions.

Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 125Cyclical developments moderately increased the deficit ratio in 2024 compared with 
2023  (item 2). The fact that cyclical developments were weaker overall weighed only 
moderately on the government budget, mainly because of continued dynamic growth 
in wages and salaries. Wage tax and social contributions remained correspondingly 
stable and largely offset the cyclical burdens caused, for example, by higher spending 
on unemployment.
Temporary crisis measures declined sharply, providing significant relief to the 
government budget  (included in item 3). Viewed in isolation, the deficit ratio thus fell 
by just over 1 percentage point. The most significant factor was the absence of the 
previous burdens caused by the energy price brakes. In addition,  rates on food in VAT
restaurants, natural gas and district heating increased again following temporary crisis-
related cuts. Revenue shortfalls due to the tax and social contribution-exempt inflation 
compensation bonuses are likely to have remained roughly unchanged compared with 
the previous year. The associated shortfalls may have amounted to around ½ % of  GDP
in both 2023 and 2024.
The structural deficit ratio saw a significant rise of almost 1 percentage point  
(item 4), reaching just over 2 %. The expenditure ratio (item 5 plus item 11) experienced 
a considerably stronger increase than the revenue ratio (item 7).  The rise in the 
expenditure ratio was also related to the high inflation of the previous years, to which 
major expenditure items were still responding with a time lag. At the same time, 
growth in nominal trend  in the denominator of the ratio (item 20 plus item 21) was GDP
significantly weaker than in the previous year due to the fall in inflation.
The increase in the structural expenditure ratio was primarily due to the sharp rise 
in social payments  (item 12). Pension expenditure, in particular, rose steeply owing to 
the high wage increases of the two preceding years and a growing number of pension 
recipients. Expenditure on healthcare and long-term care also went up significantly, 
partly because inflation had a lagged impact. The interest expenditure ratio rose  2)

2 A non-crisis-based court ruling had a one-off negative impact on the balance (included in item 3): in 
March 2024, the Federal Fiscal Court ruled that foreign investment funds that invested in German enterprises 
had been unlawfully subject to capital gains tax in the past. As a result of this ruling, the government has to 
reimburse capital gains tax. The national accounts booked the total expected tax reimbursements of just 
under ¼ % of  as a capital transfer made in full in 2024. In general, the national accounts record such GDP
payments resulting from court rulings on the expenditure side in the year when the ruling is pronounced.
3 Here and in the remainder of the supplementary information, all statements refer to structural developments.
4 While nominal expenditure expanded at a slower pace in 2024 than in 2023, the ratio experienced a stronger 
increase in 2024 because the  deflator in the denominator (item 21) saw significantly smaller growth than in GDP
the previous year.

Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 126sharply (item 5), as refinancing costs increased despite central government having to 
spend less on inflation-indexed debt instruments (item 5.1). Nevertheless, at just over 
1 %, the interest expenditure ratio remained low by longer-term standards. The ratio 
for staff expenditure (compensation of employees) increased somewhat. This was 
mainly due to the substantial wage adjustments (item 14). Furthermore, the ratio for 
subsidies rose a little (item 13), as green electricity  subsidies, in particular, grew ( )EEG
markedly.  
The structural revenue ratio increased owing to the rise in contribution rates to the 
social security funds.  Contribution rates to the health and long-term care insurance 
schemes saw a distinct rise (a combined increase of almost 0.5 percentage point), 
which raised the ratio for social contributions (item 9). Furthermore, the ratio for other 
revenue increased significantly (item 10). The ratio for taxes and social contributions 
remained constant (item 8). Fiscal drag (item 8.1) and tax cuts (item 8.3) largely 
balanced each other out.

Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 128Despite the relatively high deficit, the debt ratio is likely to have fallen moderately 
in 2024.  For one thing, factors that did not affect the deficit had a debt-reducing impact 
(negative deficit-debt adjustments). For instance, enterprises repaid government assis-
tance loans granted during the coronavirus and energy crises, transfers from 
emergency borrowing appear to have been repaid within the government sector, and 
central government continued to scale back its portfolios from the financial crisis. Due 
to these factors, central government was able to repay debts. For another thing, the 
rise in debt is lower than the deficit, as the social security funds financed their deficit 
from reserves rather than taking out new loans. Results for the debt ratio are available 
up to the end of the third quarter of 2024: by then, it had fallen to 62.4 % (end-2023: 
62.9 %).
With fiscal policy as it currently stands, the deficit ratio would probably remain 
relatively high over the next two years  (see Chart 5.1 and Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2024a) ). However, price pressures are easing and climate- Outlook for public finances
related spending could stabilise. Although expenditure on health, long-term care and 
pension insurance will probably continue to grow significantly, this will be partly offset 
by additional revenue from higher contribution rates. Defence spending appears to

Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 129fiscal rules are aimed at achieving a low structural deficit.  At the same time, action is 
required: in the area of public infrastructure and the sustainable financing of the 
defence budget, for instance. The tax burden and expenditure ratios are already 
relatively high, and demographic developments will put an additional strain on public 
finances. 
In the attempt to reconcile these aims, binding fiscal rules have a crucial role to play 
in safeguarding sound public finances.  Sound public finances are not an end in 
themselves, but rather a prerequisite for a beneficial economic framework and a 
government that is able to act even in times of crisis. They also facilitate price stability-
oriented monetary policy, as well as making favourable financing conditions and low 
interest burdens possible. This can be roughly illustrated with a back of the envelope 
calculation: in Germany, the debt ratio stands at 62½ % and the average rate of interest 
is 1.7 %. Applying the corresponding parameters of the rest of the euro area (100 % and 
2.3 %), government interest expenditure in Germany would be around €50 billion or 
1¼ % of  higher than at present. GDP  
In principle, however, provided that the government debt ratio is low, adjusting the 
requirements of the current debt brake in line with changing conditions seems justi-
fiable.  That said, higher upper limits must be reliably binding and conducive to sound 
public finances. The Bundesbank had already submitted reform proposals with this 
fundamental objective at an earlier point in time (see Deutsche Bundesbank (2022a), 
and is currently in the process of updating these. The 60 % limit for the debt ratio 
remains pivotal here. With this anchor, which is also enshrined in the European rules, 
additional scope for borrowing could help to tackle the current challenges. Even then, 
though, it would still be crucial for government to better calibrate fiscal policy as a 
whole to the concrete challenges at hand. In general, priorities on both the expenditure 
and revenue side need to be reviewed and financial resources used more effectively. It 
is also important to have a focused administration that makes decisions quickly and 
without excessive requirements and makes better use of the opportunities afforded by 
digitalisation.  3)

New  fiscal rules applied for the first timeEU
National fiscal plans, budgetary plans and excessive deficit procedures
The EU's new fiscal rules, which came into force at the end of April 2024, have been 
applied for the first time over the past few months in the assessment of medium-
term fiscal-structural plans submitted by the EU Member States.  To date, 22 of the 27 
Member States have submitted their fiscal plans.
The fiscal plans include, in particular, ceilings on net primary expenditure growth,  
which are designed to ensure that the deficit and debt targets set out in the EU 
rules are met. These expenditure ceilings are the cornerstone on which future 
budgetary surveillance will be based.  The Member States negotiate their national 
fiscal plans with the European Commission on the basis of a reference trajectory set by 
the Commission. The adjustment period agreed as part of this can be extended from 
four to up to seven years if the Member States make appropriate reform and invest-
ment commitments. The fiscal plans are required to meet certain requirements with 
regard to the reduction of debt and deficit ratios. The resulting ceilings on the growth 
rate of net primary expenditure are a key element in budgetary surveillance during the 
adjustment period.  1) 
1 Net primary expenditure is government expenditure net of: (i) interest expenditure; (ii) expenditure on 
programmes of the Union fully matched by Union funds revenue; (iii) national expenditure on co-financing of 
programmes funded by the Union; (iv) cyclical elements of unemployment benefit expenditure. Moreover, 
additional receipts or shortfalls in revenue resulting from discretionary revenue measures are added or 
deducted: for example, tax increases to finance additional expenditure are not taken into account in the net 
expenditure path.

Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 131The Council of the European Union adopted the Commission’s recommendations 
regarding the fiscal plans in January.  One part of the Commission’s Autumn Package 
involved assessing the submitted fiscal plans and making recommendations to the 
Council.  
The Commission found that all but one of the fiscal plans submitted met the fiscal frame-
work requirements.  For 16 euro area and five non-euro area countries, it recom-
mended that the Council endorse the expenditure ceilings set out in the respec-
tive fiscal plans. In a number of cases, the planned expenditure growth is higher 
than recommended by the Commission in its reference trajectories. Nevertheless, 
the Commission considered the expenditure ceilings to be adequate to achieve a 
“credible fiscal path to ensure fiscal sustainability over the medium term”. Accord-
ing to the Commission, only the Dutch fiscal plan failed to meet the requirements 
set out in the new rules.  The Dutch government waived its right to submit a 
revised plan. Consequently, the Council, acting on a recommendation by the 
Commission, set expenditure ceilings for the Netherlands.  
Five countries requested that the adjustment period of their plans be extended from 
four to seven years, thus enabling them to stagger their consolidation efforts (Finland, 
France, Italy, Romania and Spain).  In all cases, the Commission found that the condi-
tions for extending the adjustment period had been met. As agreed, these are 
less ambitious for the initial plans following the implementation of reforms than 
for future plans. 
At the time the Council issued its recommendations, five EU Member States had not yet 
submitted a fiscal plan (Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Lithuania and Austria).  In this 
case, the rules actually stipulate that the Commission recommend its own refer-
ence trajectory to the Council, but this did not happen. Instead, the Commission 
granted these Member States more time to submit their plans. 2)

made a recommendation to the Council to endorse the country’s plan. The Council followed this recommenda-
tion in February.
3 See European Commission (2024a).
4 In the Commission’s opinion, the target for the structural primary balance was insufficient to keep the debt 
ratio below the 60 % reference value over the medium term.
5 Given that the initial debt ratio and deficit ratio of the Netherlands were below 60 % and 3 %, respectively, the 
Commission issued technical information at the country’s request. As with the usual reference trajectory, it 
also includes a net expenditure path. Lithuania’s ratios are also below the two reference values. To date, the 
Commission has not issued any technical information for Lithuania.

Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 132In addition to the fiscal plans agreed, the Commission’s Autumn Package included 
other budgetary surveillance elements. 
The Commission reviewed the draft budgetary plans for 2025 submitted by the euro 
area countries.  Of the 17 plans submitted, nine, including Germany’s, are not fully in 
line with the country-specific recommendations.  To this end, the Commission 
assessed, inter alia, whether the plans were in line with the agreed expenditure 
ceilings (or those set by the Commission).  This is not the case for the Nether-
lands. An additional five Member States are only partially in line with this criterion 
(Germany, Estonia, Finland, Ireland) or are at risk of not being in line with it 
(Lithuania). In three Member States, the plans are not fully in line with the recom-
mendations owing to energy emergency support measures not being wound 
down as recommended (Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal). Three Member States did 
not submit a budgetary plan for 2025 (Belgium, Spain, Austria). 
The Council granted deadlines, some of them extensive, to countries under an excessive 
deficit procedure to correct their deficits.  In July 2024, the Council, acting on a 
recommendation by the Commission, opened an excessive deficit procedure for 
five euro area countries (Belgium, France, Italy, Malta and Slovakia). The correc-
tive paths recommended in the Council Decision of January 2025 correspond to 
the fiscal plans, where these had been submitted. Since Belgium had not yet 
submitted a fiscal plan, the Commission recommended to the Council that it 
apply its updated reference trajectory as the corrective path. However, the 
Commission has yet to publish its reference trajectory for Belgium. Ultimately, 
Italy’s deficit is set to fall below 3 % of  in 2026, with Belgium, Malta and GDP
Slovakia following suit in 2027, and France as late as 2029. 
The Commission also considered opening excessive deficit procedures for Austria and 
Finland, but did not make any recommendations.  With regard to Austria, however, it 
intends to review the situation again in the spring.  The projected deficit ratio in both 
these countries is likely to be well above the 3 % reference value in 2024. As early 
as in the autumn, the Commission proposed to the Council that it should not 
open an excessive deficit procedure for Finland, based on its forecast that the 
deficit ratio would fall back below 3 % in 2025. It postponed the decision on  6)

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 133Austria. It gave Austria the option of taking further measures to cut its deficit to 
under 3 % in 2025. In response, the caretaker government sent a proposed set of 
measures agreed by the parties involved in the coalition negotiations to the 
Commission in January. The Commission deemed the proposed measures to be 
appropriate and proposed to the Council that an excessive deficit procedure 
should not be opened for Austria for the time being, though it announced that it 
would review the case in the spring. However, the coalition negotiations broke 
down in mid-February.
In spring 2025, the Commission will assess whether Member States are implement-
ing the fiscal plans adequately and whether countries under an excessive deficit 
procedure have adopted effective measures.  The Member States submit a progress 
report each spring. The Commission will not assess Member States’ compliance with 
the 2025 expenditure ceilings until spring 2026. Any deviations from the agreed path 
will be recorded in a control account. If a threshold is exceeded, the Commission is 
required to assess whether it should recommend that the Council open an excessive 
deficit procedure.  With regard to the excessive deficit procedure, the Council has yet 
to determine the criteria for assessing whether a country has taken effective action. If 
countries under an excessive deficit procedure fail to take adequate action, sanctions 
may be imposed.
Assessment
In order to be able to verify whether the rules are applied in line with the intended 
objectives, the underlying assumptions must be presented in a comprehensive and 
clear manner. Currently, this is only the case to a certain extent.  For example, the 
Commission provides no information on how the structural balances should move in 
line with the recommended expenditure ceilings. However, changes in these balances 
are key to assessing the development of government finances. It would be helpful if the 
Commission provided an overview of this and of the target structural primary balance 
ratios and debt ratios. To make it easier to compare the fiscal plans, it would also be 
useful to have a corresponding overview based on the Commission’s macroeconomic 
assumptions. This would require converting the annual expenditure ceilings consis-
tently for all countries into structural (primary) balance ratios using the Commission’s 
assumptions.  10) 
10 The Council can open a procedure if the control account exceeds the threshold and, at the same time, the 
debt ratio rises above the 60 % reference value. The procedure does not then require the deficit ratio to 
exceed 3 %. In this case, a procedure is opened because the debt criterion has not been met.

Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 134The use of net primary expenditure as the main control variable requires trans-
parency to ensure that the rules are applied in a comprehensible and targeted 
manner.  On the face of it, the approach of taking net primary expenditure as the key 
indicator for compliance with the rules seems relatively straightforward. However, 
calculating net primary expenditure is complex. The calculations depend in no small 
part on assumptions and estimates that may change over time. One reason for this is 
to allow for cyclical developments to be taken into account. Furthermore, certain types 
of expenditure and the quantitative effect of discretionary revenue measures (in partic-
ular, tax law amendments) are factored out. This is complex and vulnerable to manipu-
lation. Having this information will make it easier to understand the decision as to 
whether a country is adhering to its agreed expenditure path. 
The debt ratio in the highly indebted countries of France, Belgium and Italy initially 
rose further during the adjustment period  (see Chart 5.2). At the end of the period 
covered by its plan, France’s debt actually exceeds today’s values, and it already has the 
longest adjustment period. The corrective paths in the excessive deficit procedure are 
also lacking in ambition. Under Italy and France’s fiscal plans, the structural balance (as 
a percentage of  should improve by an annual average of 0.4 and 0.6 percentage GDP )
point, respectively. There are already signs that even these unambitious targets may 
not be met. Based on its own estimates, the Commission anticipates that the debt 
ratios will rise more sharply than indicated in the agreed fiscal plans. Italy is expected 
to record an increase to 140 % of  by the deadline for the correction of its excessive GDP
deficit in 2026. According to the Commission’s estimates, France’s debt ratio will  
exceed 120 % by 2029.
In the similarly highly indebted countries of Portugal, Greece and Spain, debt ratios 
are declining, in some cases significantly.  Greece and Portugal are benefiting from 
the fact that they have already achieved a structural primary surplus. Consequently, 
only limited additional fiscal consolidation is required to ensure that the debt ratio 
continues to fall significantly during the adjustment period. 11)

Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 135Looking forward, it will be a matter of ensuring that the rules are implemented 
rigorously and that government finances remain on a sound footing.  The expendi-
ture ceilings are calculated in such a way that a country can achieve the intended struc-
tural balance and debt ratio ex ante. However, even if a country adheres to the agreed 
expenditure ceilings, its government finances may perform significantly worse than 
planned: such is the case when the underlying assumptions turn out to be too 
optimistic. These could be, for instance, assumptions regarding macroeconomic devel-
opments or interest rates. This would be critical, especially for countries in an excessive 
deficit procedure and with very high debt ratios. It is concerning that the fiscal plans 
adopted are, in many cases, more optimistic than the Commission’s original reference 
trajectory. Moreover, current estimates are already pointing to a rather less favourable 
trajectory in a number of cases. This is another reason why it is important to implement

further. This is without prejudice to the proposal to activate the escape clause for

2.1 Tax revenue
2.1.1 2024 as a whole
Tax revenue rose by 4 % (+€31 billion) in 2024. It thus exceeded the official tax 
estimate of October 2024 (€6 billion);  see Chart 5.3 and Table 5.2. In addition to wage 
tax and  the withholding tax on interest income and capital gains contributed VAT,
around one-third to the increase on 2023, irrespective of its limited weight.
Wage tax revenue rose by 5½ % (+€13 billion) and was thus virtually in line with the 
official tax estimate.  This increase was roughly equal to the growth in gross wages and 
salaries. Additional revenue from progressive income taxation was offset by tax cuts. 
Inflation-induced income growth (bracket creep) and real income growth resulted in 


Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 138progression-related tax hikes. This is due to the current procedure of adjusting the 
income tax scale to inflation with a lag of one year:  at the start of 2024, it was lowered 
relatively sharply in order to compensate for the high inflation of 2023.
Revenue from profit-related taxes went up by 3 %. It thus exceeded the official tax 
estimate by €2½ billion.  The fact that revenue increased at all was because of a surge 
in receipts from withholding tax on interest income and capital gains (+130 %, or +
€11 billion) due to higher interest income. By contrast, income from corporation tax fell 
sharply (-11½ %, or -€5 billion), which is likely to reflect a deterioration in the macroeco-
nomic profit situation. 
VAT revenue rose by 3½ % (+€10½ billion), mainly as a result of expiring temporary 
tax cuts, exceeding the official estimate by €3 billion.  VAT revenue growth was very 
weak in  but saw surprising positive developments in   Q3, Q4.

2.1.2 Outlook for 2025
For the current year, the official tax estimate from October 2024 shows a 3 % 
increase in tax revenue, with tax cuts approved in the meantime having a burden-
ing effect.  However, the revenue shortfalls stemming from new legislative changes 
could be offset to some degree by the fact that the higher than estimated annual result 
for 2024 is likely to be carried forward, at least in part, into the current year. 
The most significant tax cut to date affects the income tax scale.  Even after the 
collapse of the Federal Government, parliamentary majorities voted to adjust the 
income tax scale downwards at the beginning of this year, thus offsetting last year’s 
bracket creep. In addition, income tax allowances for 2024 were raised retroactively in 
December 2024. Taken together, these changes are expected to reduce tax revenue 
growth by €11 billion, or just over 1 percentage point, in the current year. Further tax 
policy decisions may be pending after the Bundestag election. As things currently

uncertainties, particularly with regard to revenue from the solidarity surcharge (¼ of

The deficit for central government including its off-budget entities  was signifi-

This was mainly due to the strong improvement in the core budget result.  
In the core budget, the deficit contracted from €65 billion to €25 billion compared 
with 2023 (see Table 5.3, item 3), which was chiefly attributable to a surge in non-tax

ties and lower discounts.

The deficit was thus €24 billion lower than in the budget plan.  Revenue significantly 
exceeded expectations, mainly due to the repayment of crisis assistance funds. Expendi-
ture undershot the estimates by €11 billion (see Table 5.3, item 1). In arithmetical 
terms, the global spending cut of €11 billion was already achieved due to the fact that

Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 144cancelled. In addition, expenditure on personnel, interest and other operating expendi-
ture was lower than planned. 
According to the preliminary debt brake accounting, net borrowing fell short of its 
limit by just under €3 billion (see Table 5.3, item 10).  In the budget plan, central 
government had fully exhausted the debt brake borrowing limit. Compared with the 
plans, the following factors were relevant:
The fact that the deficit was €24 billion lower (see above) should have had an 
easing effect on the budget. 
However, there were two reasons why this reduction in the deficit ultimately did 
not affect the debt brake.
First, this was partly attributable to return flows of crisis assistance funds 
(€8½ billion). These funds had been financed by emergency borrowing, and 
their repayment did not create fiscal space.
Second, financial transactions deviated from the budget plans (just under 
€16 billion; see Table 5.3, item 8). These are not counted towards the debt 
brake. For instance, central government did not issue the planned loan of 
€12 billion for the generational capital fund, and privatisation proceeds of 
€3½ billion were not included.
The fact that a higher cyclical burden allowed for net borrowing of almost 
€13 billion more under the debt brake (Table 5.3, item 7) ultimately brought relief. 
The fact that central government made less recourse to reserves (Table 5.3, item 
5) had a negative impact: it conserved €10 billion, thus recording higher net 
borrowing.
By conserving its reserves, central government increased its fiscal space for 2025 by 
€10 billion.  The undershooting of the upper limit of the debt brake (by €3 billion) is 
recorded (positively) in the control account (Table 5.3, item 24). The control account 
records all positive and negative deviations from the constitutional borrowing limit 
during budget implementation (less emergency borrowing). However, central govern-

Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 145ment cannot use the control account for budget planning. This distinguishes the credit 
balance on the control account from the reserves. 
In the case of off-budget entities, the deficit rose by €1 billion on 2023, to €24 billion. 
The high deficit in the Economic Stabilisation Fund for Energy Assistance (-ESF E) fell 
away, but the outturn in several other off-budget entities deteriorated, particularly 
the Climate Fund and the Armed Forces Fund.  
In contrast to the previous year, the deficit of almost €42 billion in the ESF-E fell 
away (see Table 5.3, item 16). After the Federal Constitutional Court’s debt brake 
ruling, central government dissolved the ESF-E at the end of 2023. Interest expen-
diture as well as remaining spending commitments and repayment claims were 
assumed by the core budget.
In the Climate Fund, the deficit surged by just over €21 billion (to €23 billion; see 
Table 5.3, item 17.a). Although federal legislators had increased the price of 
German emissions allowances by one-half,  total receipts from allowances 
 7) 
 8) 7 In 2023, central government had suspended the planned increase in response to high energy prices. With this 
sharp increase, central government returned to the old price path. 

Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 146barely increased. The volume of allowances sold thus appears to have declined.  
By contrast, expenditure by the Climate Fund doubled (+€21 billion). Ultimately, 
the main reason for this was that central government assumed the renewable 
energy ( )EEG  levy that was previously being paid by consumers (+€18 billion).
In the Armed Forces Fund, the deficit climbed steeply, by €11 billion to €17 billion 
(Table 5.3, item 20). However, the increase is due not only to additional procure-
ment of military goods, but also, to a large extent, to outsourcing from the core 
budget.
In the case of SoFFin  (Table 5.3, part of item 19), last year’s surplus of just over 
€4 billion lapsed because the bad bank FMS  Wertmanagement did not repay loans 
in net terms again. 
In the Digitalisation Fund (see Table 5.3, item 17.d), the deficit increased by 
€3 billion. The fund was dissolved and its reserves of €4 billion transferred to the 
core budget (with an impact on the deficit). 
The off-budget entities’ budget outturn was €28 billion more favourable than in the 
published borrowing plan figures.  The surpluses of the  and central government’s ESF
precautionary special funds for pension burdens (Table 5.3, part of item 19) were the 
main factor in this. Central government does not release any planned figures for these 
items. Moreover, lower than planned spending reduced the deficits of the Climate Fund 
and the Armed Forces Fund to €5½ billion and €2½ billion below the planned figures 
respectively. Although expenditure in the defence section of the budget was likewise 
lower than planned, the  target of 2 % of  was reached, according to central NATO GDP
government.  8) 
 9) 
8 The decline in emissions cannot be calculated from this, especially as allowances could still be purchased 
retroactively in the following year.
9 Up to mid-2022, central government charged a levy on electricity prices (from which large industrial 
consumers were exempt) to finance subsidies guaranteed in the long term for climate-friendly electricity 
production. Once the levy was abolished, central government was able to finance electricity subsidies up to 
end-2023 using the remaining funds from the levy. Since then, central government has had to take these subsi-
dies into account in its budget plans, and made recourse to the Climate Fund in 2024, which used extensive 
reserves of its own for this purpose. Payments from the core budget are planned from this year onwards. The 
end of the electricity price levy is now putting a considerable strain on central government, making the scale 
of the subsidy clearly evident once more.

Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 147Its more favourable budget outturn will give the Climate Fund a correspondingly larger 
than planned reserve for deficits this year (a total of €6 billion). The Armed Forces Fund 
now has a correspondingly higher residual borrowing authorisation, totalling 
€77 billion (see Table 5.3, item 20.a). 
2.2.2 Outlook for 2025 and beyond
In the absence of a valid budget plan, the rules for interim budget management will 
apply. These rules do not compel the government to embark on a restrictive change 
of course.  The government will be able to meet all its legal and contractual obligations. 
In addition, it can keep spending on funding programmes and investment measures 
that have already begun. The Federal Ministry of Finance’s budget circular  sets 
expenditure limits for such instances. Extrabudgetary expenditure is an option in the 
event of unavoidable necessity. In the case of interim budget management, central 
government may borrow far more than permitted under the debt brake to finance 
expenditure.
Interim budget management likewise restricts off-budget entities to only a limited 
extent.  This is notably the case for the two largest special funds: the Armed Forces 
Fund and the Climate Fund. Although they have sizeable obligations for 2025, these do 
not overburden the total borrowing available for interim budget management. In the 
case of the Climate Fund, income from emission allowances also reduces borrowing 
requirements. 
Revenue from the solidarity surcharge is exposed to a judicial risk.  Following oral 
proceedings on a constitutional complaint on 12 November 2024, the Federal Constitu-
tional Court could announce its verdict this year. Revenue from the solidarity surcharge 
is therefore subject to risk. The tax estimate puts this revenue at €13 billion in 2025. In 
addition, the Federal Constitutional Court could order central government to repay 
revenue from previous years.
In any case, action must be taken to comply with the debt brake in 2025. Federal 
Finance Minister Jörg Kukies recently put the amount required to do so at €16 billion. 10) 
 11) 
10 See Federal Ministry of Finance (2024).
11 The solidarity surcharge is a surtax on income tax and corporation tax and is paid solely to central govern-
ment. Deviation from the usual distribution of revenue from these taxes between central government, state 
governments and local governments is subject to certain conditions. For a discussion on the continuation of 
the solidarity surcharge beyond 2020, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2018), p. 60.

Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 148The first draft budget, presented in the summer of 2024, only formally respected the 
borrowing limit. In addition to a large “residuum” global spending cut (total appropria-
tions across the board declared to remain unused), this was due, not least, to tightly 
calculated appropriations, such as for the civic allowance.  In the meantime, new 
burdens have emerged: in particular, the tax estimate of October 2024 was significantly 
lower than budgeted figures and there is a greater amount needed for green electricity 
subsidies. While these burdens are accompanied by factors providing relief, the latter 
do not appear to have closed the gap: the higher core budget reserves (+€10 billion, 
see above) have made more room in the budget, and tax revenue in 2024 was €3 billion 
above the last tax estimate. In addition, the cyclical scope for borrowing under the debt 
brake would increase by €7½ billion if the budget were based on the Federal Govern-
ment’s Annual Economic Report. 
There will be mounting challenges in the years thereafter.  Central government is 
then likely to have used up reserves. In addition, not only are  grants under theEU NGEU
programme decreasing in 2025; from 2027, central government will have to manage 
without them altogether. From 2028 onwards, pension contribution rates will rise 
sharply, which will lead to an increase in government funds for the pension insurance 
scheme. Above all, the Armed Forces Fund’s borrowing authorisations are set to be 
exhausted, with expenditure again having to be financed out of the core budget. In 
addition, the need for even higher defence spending is currently the subject of 
renewed discussion; sustainable financing must ultimately be found to cover greater 
structural needs. Repayment of emergency borrowing will also start in 2028 under the 
current repayment schedule. This will narrow scope for borrowing by just over 
€9 billion initially. As of 2031, this reduction is even likely to reach €14 billion as first 
repayments for the E and the Armed Forces Fund will fall due.ESF-
2.3 State government budgets
State government core budgets posted a much larger deficit of €7½ billion in 2024 
(2023: €1 billion). However, this increase was largely due to individual federal states 
acquiring financial assets.  Revenue grew by just over 3 %. While tax revenue rose at a 
slightly higher rate, transfers from other public administrations fell somewhat (these 
transfers come from central government and the administrations’ own special funds, in  12) 
12 For the draft central government budget for 2025, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2024c).

Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 149particular). Total expenditure went up significantly, climbing by 4½ % (+€23 billion). In 
particular, spending on personnel – a major expenditure item – increased by 7 % (+
€11 billion). This was mainly due to the last collective wage agreement, the terms of 
which the individual federal states also applied to civil servants. Transfers to local 
government on a similarly large scale rose at a slightly above average rate (+
€6½ billion). In addition, state governments increased spending on capital injections 
and equity acquisitions by €4 billion: Hesse alone made a one-off investment of 
€2 billion into its Landesbank. 
However, these figures are of only limited informational value for state government 
finances, notably because information on off-budget entities is lacking.  Initial nation-
wide data covering 2024 as a whole for core budgets and off-budget entities will not be 
available until the end of the current quarter. However, there are also signs of a deterio-
ration for off-budget entities: after three quarters, their outturn was €6 billion less 
favourable than in the previous year.  
Bremen, Saarland, Saxony-Anhalt and Schleswig-Holstein activated the escape 
clause of their debt brakes in 2024.  This is necessary in order to use funds from 
emergency borrowing. Other federal states were planning to repay a portion of their  
emergency borrowing. The federal states differ greatly not only in how they apply their 


Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 150escape clauses but also, in some cases, in how their debt brakes are designed. It would 
be beneficial for the transparency of public finances to more closely harmonise the 
debt brakes. One candidate for greater harmonisation would be cyclical adjustment. 
This year, the state government deficit is likely to change little, despite the absence 
of the above-mentioned capital injections and equity acquisitions that affected the 
balance last year. Personnel expenditure is expected to continue growing markedly 
due to wage adjustments, albeit at a significantly slower pace than last year. Transfers 
to local government could see similar developments as tax revenue.  
Saarland, Saxony-Anhalt and Schleswig-Holstein are planning to make use of 
emergency borrowing this year, too.  Saarland declared a state of emergency on the 
basis of structural change in the region and last year’s floods. Schleswig-Holstein points 
to the impact of the crisis triggered by Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. 
Saxony-Anhalt cites the consequences of the 19 pandemic as justification. All COVID -
three federal states already have a per capita debt burden that significantly exceeds 
the average of the non-city states. In this respect, caution would appear warranted 
when financing expenditure using borrowed funds.

3.1 Pension insurance scheme
3.1.1 2024 as a whole
The statutory pension insurance scheme recorded a deficit of €2 billion for 2024 as a 
whole. It had posted a surplus of €1½ billion in the previous year.  As at the end of 
2024, the sustainability reserve had shrunk to €44 billion (just over 1.5  times the 
scheme’s monthly expenditure); its minimum is 0.2 times the scheme’s average 
monthly expenditure (just under €6 billion). The figures are expected to improve 
somewhat with the final annual accounts. The pension insurance scheme is currently 
planning to run deficits and thus gradually bring its sustainability reserve back to the 
statutory minimum.


Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 152At 6 %, expenditure growth was stronger than growth in revenue.  On an annual 
average, pensions rose by 4½ % in line with the regular adjustment. The number of 
pensions grew by 0.6 %. In addition, the pension insurance scheme paid out new flat-
rate supplements to persons drawing reduced earning capacity pensions. Total  
revenue rose sharply (+5½ %), even though federal legislators cut government funds for 
discretionary spending by just over €1 billion. 
3.1.2 Outlook for 2025
The deficit looks set to rise considerably this year.  Contribution receipts are likely to 
grow at a markedly weaker rate than last year, with earnings subject to compulsory 
contributions rising more slowly even though social contribution-exempt inflation 
compensation bonuses have now been discontinued. This cannot be offset by what is 
expected to be faster growth in government funds (government funds are linked to the 
wage developments from two years previously, and remuneration rose particularly 
sharply in 2023). 
Expenditure is set to continue rising more dynamically than revenue.  Up until mid-
year, the significant pension adjustment from 2024 will be in effect (+4½ %). In mid-
2025, the adjustment could be close to 4 %.  Additionally, the number of pensions is 
expected to increase more strongly than in 2024 due to demographic factors. This will 
be accompanied by additional expenditure of another almost €1½ billion on the new 
supplements to pensions for reduced earning capacity. The burdens brought about by 
the sharp rise in the average supplementary contribution rates to the statutory health 
insurance scheme are similarly high.  13) 
 14) 
13 Since 2024, the pension insurance scheme has been paying these supplements to persons who began 
drawing their reduced earning capacity pensions between 2001 and 2018. These are likely to have contributed 
almost €1½ billion to expenditure in 2024, increasing the rise in spending by just under ½ percentage point. 
14 The 2024 pension insurance report (see Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (2024)) anticipated that 
this would be 3½ %. However, in 2024, the relevant wages grew by just under ½ percentage point more than 
had been assumed in the report. In addition, the Federal Government has since raised the contribution rate to 
the public long-term care insurance scheme by 0.2 %. All else being equal, the adjustment therefore needs to 
be 0.1 percentage point higher in order to maintain the minimum replacement rate of 48 %. The reason for 
this is that pension recipients pay the entire contribution to the long-term care insurance scheme themselves. 
By contrast, employees’ contributions are paid in part by employers. Therefore, the higher contribution rate 
weighs on pensions more strongly in the numerator of the replacement rate than on wages in the denomina-
tor. 

Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 1533.1.3 Longer-term outlook
In the second half of this decade, demographic factors will weigh significantly more 
heavily on pension scheme finances.  Pressure on both the expenditure and the 
revenue side will increase due to particularly large birth cohorts retiring. The contribu-
tion rate therefore needs to rise considerably (see also Deutsche Bundesbank (2024b), 
the supplementary information entitled ). In Social contribution rates to rise sharply
addition, the replacement rate is a key metric for expenditure development. Under 
current legislation, this will remain at 48 % until the end of 2025 and will then gradually 
decline. At the end of the next decade, it could stand at around 45 %. Nevertheless, the 
contribution rate will rise sharply: according to the pension insurance report published 
last November, the rate will increase by 1.3 percentage point to 19.9 % by 2028 under 
the current legal framework. Further increases will subsequently be needed, which 
could result in a contribution rate of around 21½ % by the end of the next decade.
In order to alleviate demographic financing pressures, it would be expedient to 
reduce financial incentives for early retirement and to link the retirement age after 
2030 to life expectancy.  In particular, full pensions without any deductions after 45 
years of contributions are a financial incentive for early retirement. Moreover, longer 
life expectancy and an unchanged statutory retirement age also mean a lower ratio of 
years of employment to years of retirement. In order to prevent this, after 2030, the 
retirement age could be linked to life expectancy. These measures would provide a 
boost, not least, to employment and thus to economic activity as well as the govern-
ment revenue base, and they would also curb pension expenditure. In this way, they 
would reduce funding pressures, not just on the statutory pension insurance scheme 
and the central government budget but also in other areas.  15) 
15 The pension insurance report offers little informational value this year, as it reflects the planned rather than 
the current legal situation. The Social Advisory Council therefore also details how pension scheme finances 
would develop under current legislation. See Social Advisory Council (2024). 

Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 1543.2 Federal Employment Agency
The Federal Employment Agency posted a deficit of €½ billion in 2024.  On balance, 
this was the result of the Federal Employment Agency spending more on insolvency 
benefit and winter employment compensation than it received via the contributions for 
these. However, the reserves for these benefits still came to €2 billion as at the end of 
2024. The core budget reserves remained broadly unchanged at €3 billion.
Compared with the previous year, the Federal Employment Agency’s outturn deteri-
orated significantly (2023: surplus of €3 billion), mainly because unemployment 
benefits – a major expenditure item – increased sharply.  At 5½ %, Federal Employment 
Agency revenue also grew considerably, but to a much lesser extent than expenditure 
(+15 %). Unemployment benefits rose by 18 %, mainly due to a higher number of recipi- 
ents (+12 %). Active labour market policy expenditure likewise went up sharply 
(+13½ %), but it is significantly smaller in volume. Payments for insolvency benefit grew 
by 30 % (up by just under €½ billion). At 10 %, administrative expenditure rose sharply, 
 16) 
16 In the core budget, i.e. excluding the civil servants’ pension fund of the Federal Employment Agency. The 
transfers to this fund come out of the core budget. However, the civil servants’ pension fund recorded a 
surplus of €½ billion. As at the end of 2024, its funds amounted to €8½ billion. 

Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – February 2025 155partly because the Federal Employment Agency sharply raised the transfers to its civil 
servants’ pension fund. 
The Federal Employment Agency expects its finances to deteriorate somewhat this 
year, anticipating a deficit of almost €1½ billion in its core budget.  Its planned 
revenue is 4½ % higher than the figure for 2024. Contribution receipts are likely to grow 
at a markedly weaker rate than in the previous year. By contrast, the budget plan 
assumes an increase in the insolvency benefit contribution rate from 0.06 % to 0.1 %. 
Expenditure is expected to see a sharp rise of 6 % compared with the previous year, 
driven by strong growth in active labour market policy. This is partly due to the fact that 
central government is shifting costs for recipients of the civic allowance to the Federal 
Employment Agency.
As things stand, the Federal Employment Agency’s outturn is likely to be signifi-
cantly worse than planned.  According to the Bundesbank’s December 2024 Forecast 
for Germany, labour market developments are markedly less favourable than those 
assumed in the Federal Employment Agency’s plans. Meanwhile, the additional revenue 
from the higher insolvency benefit contribution rate is of only minor importance: 
contrary to plans, the Federal Government did not set the contribution rate at the 
intended 0.1 % at the start of the year. As a result, it returned to its legally enshrined 
standard level of 0.15 %.

* Monetary financial institutions (MFIs) comprise banks (including building and loan
associations), money market funds, and the European Central Bank and national central
banks (the Eurosystem).  1 Source: ECB.  2 In Germany, only savings deposits.
3 Excluding holdings of MFIs; for the German contribution, excluding German MFIs'
portfolios of securities issued by MFIs in the euro area.  4 In Germany, bank debt
securities with maturities of up to one year are classed as money market paper.5 Excluding liabilities arising from securities issued.  6 After deduction of inter-MFI
participations.  7 The German contributions to the Eurosystem's monetary aggregates
should on no account be interpreted as national monetary aggregates and are
therefore not comparable with the erstwhile German money stocks M1, M2 or M3.
8 Including DEM banknotes still in circulation (see also footnote 4 on p. 10●). 9 For
the German contribution, the difference between the volume of euro banknotes

for the reserve maintenance period ending in the month indicated. Following the
changeover in the frequency of Governing Council monetary policy meetings to a
six-week cycle, a reserve maintenance period no longer ends in every month. No figuresare available in such cases.  2 Source: ECB.  3 Includes liquidity provided under the
Eurosystem's asset purchase programmes.  4 From August 2009 includes liquidity

2002 euro banknotes and other banknotes which have been issued by the national cen-
tral banks of the Eurosystem and which are still in circulation. In accordance with the
accounting procedure chosen by the Eurosystem for the issue of euro banknotes, a

allocated to the ECB on a monthly basis. The counterpart of this adjustment is shown
under “Other factors”. The remaining 92% of the value of the euro banknotes in
circulation is allocated, likewise on a monthly basis, to the NCBs, with each NCB
showing in its balance sheet the share of the euro banknotes issued corresponding to
its paid-up share in the ECB's capital. The difference between the value of the euro
banknotes allocated to an NCB and the value of the euro banknotes which that NCB
has put into circulation is likewise shown under “Other factors”. From 2003 eurobanknotes only.  6 Remaining items in the consolidated financial statement of the Euro-
system and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  7 Equal to the difference bet-
ween the sum of liquidity-pro viding factors and the sum of liquidity-absorbing factors.
8 Calculated as the sum of the “Deposit facility”, “Banknotes in circulation” and “Credit
institutions' current account balances”.

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).

Sources: The calculations for the insurance sectors are based on supervisory data
according to Solvency I and II and for pension funds on IORP supervisory data and own
data collections.  1 Including deposits retained on ceded business as well as registered
bonds, borrower's note loans and registered Pfandbriefe.  2 Including claims of pension
funds on pension managers and entitlements to non-pension benefits.  3 Technical
reserves "life" taking account of transitional measures, which will no longer apply to
most insurance companies from Q2/2024. Health insurance is also included in the"non-life insurance" sector.  4 Not including the reinsurance business conducted by pri-
mary insurers, which is included there.  5 Valuation at book values. The term "pension
funds" refers to the institutional sector "pension funds" of the European System of
Accounts. Pension funds thus comprise company pension schemes and occupational
pension schemes for the self-employed. Social security funds are not included.  6 Own
funds correspond to the sum of "Net worth" and "Shares and other equity".

* The effective exchange rate corresponds to the weighted external value of the curren-
cy concerned. The method of calculating the indicators of the German economy's price
competitiveness is consistent with the procedure to compute the effective exchange
rates of the euro. A decline in the figures implies an increase in competitiveness. The
weights are based on trade in manufactured goods and services. For more detailed in-
formation on methodology and weighting scale, see the website of the Deutsche
Bundesbank (https://www.bundesbank.de/content/796162).  1 The calculations are
based on the weighted averages of the changes in the bilateral exchange rates of the
euro vis-à-vis the currencies of the following 18 countries: Australia, Bulgaria, Canada,
China, Czechia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan, Norway, Poland, Romania,
Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United
States. Where current price and wage indices were not available, estimates were used.
2 Includes countries belonging to the extended EER group of trading partners (fixed
composition) and additionally the following 23 countries: Algeria, Argentina, Brazil,
Chile, Colombia, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, New Zea-
land, Peru, Philippines, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Taiwan,Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and United Arab Emirates. The ECB has suspended the
publication and calculation of the euro foreign exchange reference rate against Russian
rouble with effect from March 2, 2022 until further notice. For the calculation of
effective exchange rates, an indicative rate is used for the Russian Federation from that
date. It is calculated from the daily RUB/USD rates determined by the Bank of Russia in
conjunction with the respective ECB's euro foreign exchange reference rate to the US
dollar.  3 Annual and quarterly averages.  4 Euro area countries (from 2001 including
