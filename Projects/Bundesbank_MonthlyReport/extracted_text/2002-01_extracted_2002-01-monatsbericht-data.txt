5CommentariesEconomic conditions
ManufacturingEconomic developments in manufacturing
were marked by decreasing output thatcontinued in November 2001. Taking theautumn months of October and Novembertogether, there was a seasonally adjustedfall of 2
34% compared with the summer
months. The year-on-year decline widened to4%, having been no more than 1% in thethird quarter.
There was, however, a slight improvement in
the orders position towards the end of theperiod under review. In particular, moreforeign orders were placed on the books,seasonally adjusted, than in the precedingmonths, which had brought a new low. Thevolume of new orders was nevertheless stillquite depressed. The two autumn months ofOctober and November were 1
34% down on
the average level of the third quarter. The de-cline amounted to 10% on the year, com-pared with a figure of – 6% in summer. In-coming domestic orders fell again somewhatin November in seasonally adjusted terms. InOctober and November, they were a season-ally adjusted 3% below the figure for thethird quarter and 8% down on the year, theyear-on-year fall having been just under 5%in the summer quarter. After adjustmentfor seasonal variations, domestic and foreignbusiness combined brought a slight expan-sion in orders, although they were 8
34%
down on their level of 12 months previously.Output

6Construction
Seasonally adjusted construction output in
November did not quite match the Octoberlevel and was 9
12% down on the year. A cyc-
lical assessment of the current situation ismade more difficult by the fact that the statis-tics for spring and summer have not yet beenadjusted to the figures for the 2001 overallsurvey.
Although there was a slight increase in Octo-
ber – after adjustment for seasonal vari-ations – in the volume of construction ordersreceived, the average level of the summermonths was still undershot by 1
12%. Year-
on-year, there was a decline of 514%, com-
pared with – 4% in the third quarter.
While there was a slight improvement in the
orders position for public construction in theearly autumn, residential and industrial con-struction remained weak.
Labour marketThe cyclical weakness was latterly having a
heavier impact on the labour market. In par-ticular, there was a significant fall in employ-ment in October (more recent data are un-available at present). The seasonally adjustedmonth-on-month decline in the number ofpersons in work of around 20,000 to 38.73million was noticeably sharper than before.This means that, for the first time in somewhile, there was a year-on-year fall, amount-ing to just over 50,000, or 0.1%.Economic conditions in Germany*

7The number of persons out of work went up
by around 175,000 in December, althoughthis rise was largely consistent with the sea-sonal pattern. This meant that there was onlya slight increase to 3.94 million in seasonallyadjusted terms, i.e. 155,000 persons morethan a year before. The unemployment rateas calculated by the Federal Labour Office re-mained at 9.5%. The standardised rate wasunchanged at 8.0%.
In December, 175,000 employees were
working short-time, i.e. 105,000 more than12 months earlier. Fewer persons than beforewere taking part in job creation schemes orattending vocational training courses, how-ever, with the figure being 110,000 lowerthan 12 months previously.
PricesPrice developments remained calm at the end
of 2001, too. Seasonally adjusted, the con-sumer price index persisted at the same levelin December as in the previous month, thus,in turn, matching its level in May. As before,the year-on-year rate of increase amountedto 1.7%. While mineral oil products re-mained significantly cheaper than they hadbeen in the same period of 2000, food costconsiderably more. Consumer prices for ser-vices were 2.8% higher than 12 months earl-ier. Manufactured goods and house rentswere 1.2% and 1.3% up on the year, re-spectively.
Latterly, international oil prices – measured
by Brent North Sea Oil – were at just underUS$ 19, after having gone up to US$ 22 for atime. German import prices, for which figures
are available up to November, benefited fromthe oil prices tending to fall. They showed afurther seasonally adjusted month-on-monthdecline, the year-on-year fall in prices increas-ing to 6.6%.
The producer prices of industrial products
also fell again in November, being around1
12% down from their preceding mid-2001
peak in seasonally adjusted terms. The rise inprices over 12 months decreased to no morethan 0.1%, compared with + 2.6% in thethird quarter. Agricultural producer priceslikewise declined in seasonally adjusted termsin November. The year-on-year rate of in-crease, which – not least owing to unfavour-able weather conditions – had gone up to+ 5.7% for a time in September, went downto + 0.9%.
Public finance
Government indebtednessIn November the indebtedness of the central,
regional and local authorities again increasedvery sharply (by 312.7 billion). This was main-
ly due to the strong increase in demand forshort-term cash advances. The Federal Gov-ernment, for example, expanded its outstand-ing volume of money market loans by 310.4
billion up to the end of November. As thisnew borrowing was partly offset by redemp-tions in the capital market amounting to 33.9
billion on balance, the Federal Government’snet indebtedness rose by 36.5 billion. The

8inter alia to five-year special Federal bonds
(Bobls). As the proceeds from a reopened
Bobl issue auction were outweighed by a dis-
tinctly larger refinancing requirement, the li-abilities from these securities declined by 31.4
billion. The outstanding volume of Federalsavings bonds contracted by the even largermargin of 31.9 billion, while bank loans were
repaid in the net amount of 31.3 billion.
The Länder Governments expanded their in-
debtedness in November by 36.3 billion,
which was roughly the same amount as inOctober. However, the new borrowings inNovember mainly took the form of short-term cash advances from banks ( 33.9 billion).
The Länder Governments raised other size-able sums through issues of Treasury notes(31.5 billion) and loans from banks againstborrowers’ notes ( 30.9 billion). Of the off-
budget special funds, the “German Unity”Fund marginally decreased its debt by 30.2
billion. The local authorities appear to havedrawn on the credit markets to a minor ex-tent. The City of Munich redeemed a bond,which was one of the few securities on Ger-many’s nascent market for municipal bonds.
Federal Government borrowingIn December the Federal Government curbed
its indebtedness by 37.9 billion. It reduced its
money market liabilities by as much as 310.9
billion to 33.8 billion. By contrast, it tapped
the capital market for a further 33.0 billion
net. The outstanding volume of Federal Treas-ury notes (Schätze) expanded by 34.6 billion
following the quarterly new issue, whichyielded 39.4 billion gross (including 30.2 bil-
lion for the “German Unity” Fund). None ofthe other Federal securities recorded notablemovements. The Federal Government re-deemed loans against borrowers’ notes by31.3 billion net.
In 2001 as a whole the Federal Government’s
net borrowing totalled slightly more than 318
billion (excluding the exceptional redemp-tions of equalisation claims out of UMTS pro-ceeds), whereas its gross borrowing amount-ed to almost 3135 billion.

1In the budget accounts new borrowing for 2001
amounted to just under 323 billion, exceeding the
budget estimate by 312billion. It typically deviates from
the net borrowing in the market shown here, partly be-
cause transactions are booked at different times in the

9man Unity” Fund) reached 3701 billion at
the end of 2001. Owing to the extraordinaryredemptions from UMTS proceeds, this wasjust under 315 billion lower than the corres-
ponding figure at the end of 2000. With re-gard to the debt structure, the share of Bunds
(bonds with a maturity of ten and thirtyyears) increased by a further 3
12percentage
points last year to almost 60% of the FederalGovernment’s debt. While the share of five-and-a-half-year Bobls remained steady at just
over 17%, the share of two-year Schätze
increased by more than a third to 8
12%. At
the short end of the maturity spectrum, theoutstanding volume of six-month Bubills
doubled. Their share in total indebtednessrose to almost 3%. However, looking at theoverall segment of short-dated and floating-rate notes, its share contracted last year be-cause the Currency Conversion EqualisationFund redeemed 335 billion worth of claims
(remunerated at the three-month Euriborrate). As a result, their share decreased by5 percentage points to only
12%. The relative
importance of Federal savings bonds andloans against borrowers’ notes declined fur-ther, with their respective shares in the Fed-eral Government’s indebtedness falling by theend of 2001 to just under 4% and just over6%.
The Federal budget and the Federal Govern-
ment’s issuance calendar together indicategross borrowing of 3174 billion in 2002 for
financing redemptions of 3153 billion and
net new borrowing of 321 billion. This im-
plies that net borrowing will be somewhatlower than in 2001, whereas gross borrowingwill increase sharply. This is due in part to theadditional funding requirements to redeem
bonds issued by the former Treuhand agency(+310 billion) and by the former state rail-
way company Deutsche Bundesbahn (+ 33
billion). But the chief cause of the increase ingross borrowing is the further raising of theoutstanding volume of Bubills this year from
320 billion to 330 billion. They will be placed
in a new issuance rhythm of 35 billion per
month beginning in the second quarter of2002. This will lead to a correspondinglylarger refinancing requirement for this short-dated paper. The Federal Government’s issu-ance schedule also envisages increases in thestandard volumes (including the amount setaside for market management) of Schätze ,
with a quarterly rise from 310 billion to 312
billion, and Bobls, with the six-monthly total
going up from 315 billion to 318 billion. TheFederal Government net borrowing in

Securities markets
Bond marketIn November, domestic borrowers issued
bonds to the market value of 380.8 billion,
compared with 377.9 billion in October. Net
of redemptions, and after taking due accountof changes in issuers’ holdings of their ownbonds, net sales came to 37.2 billion, com-
pared with 318.3 billion in October. On bal-
ance, they consisted entirely of long-termpaper (with maturities of more than fouryears). Foreign bonds were placed in the Ger-man market to the value of 35.2 billion; two-
thirds of them were bonds denominated ineuro. Overall, net sales of domestic and for-eign bonds yielded 312.4 billion in Novem-
ber, compared with 325.9 billion a month
before.
Credit institutions received 311.0 billion net
from sales of their own debt securities. Netsales, however, were confined to bonds is-sued by specialised credit institutions ( 315.2
billion). They were mainly used to redeemdebt securities that were launched by a for-eign financing subsidiary. The outstandingamount of all other types of bank debt secur-ities declined. Other bank debt securitieswere repurchased to the tune of 32.4 billion,
public Pfandbriefe to31.5 billion, and mort-
gage Pfandbriefe to30.3 billion.In November, the public sector reduced its in-
debtedness in the bond market by 31.6
billion, the Federal Government alone by32.6 billion. The Federal Government aug-
mented its five-year special Federal bondissues series 138, at 4.5%, by 37 billion by
tender, but, owing to higher redemptions,the outstanding amount of such paper de-creased by 31.4 billion.
2Federal savings
bonds also recorded net redemptions; theywere repurchased to the extent of 31.9 bil-
lion. The outstanding amount of ten-yearbonds and two-year Federal Treasury notes,however, increased slightly by 30.3 billion
and 30.1 billion, respectively. In November,
the Länder Governments launched bonds tothe value of 31.5 billion.
The outstanding amount of corporate bonds
declined by 32.1 billion in November.
No Deutsche Mark/euro bonds issued by
non-residents under the lead management ofGerman syndicates were launched in Novem-ber. Owing to redemptions, the outstandingamount of such paper declined by 33.2 bil-
lion.
On the buyers’ side of the bond market, non-
residents were in the forefront in November.They purchased domestic bonds worth 314.3
billion (net), consisting entirely of paper is-sued by individuals ( 315.7 billion net). Do-
mestic non-banks increased their bond port-

11folios by 35.0 billion. They shifted German
bonds (– 32.6 billion) into foreign bonds
(37.6 billion). Credit institutions reduced
their holdings of debt securities by 36.8 bil-
lion.
Equity marketIn November, issuing activity in the German
equity market virtually came to a standstill,after having been comparatively strong inOctober. Domestic enterprises placed newshares to the market value of 30.4 billion
(October: 34.1 billion). The outstanding
amount of foreign equities in Germany de-clined by 30.2 billion. Overall, domestic and
foreign equities were sold in the Germanmarket to the amount of only 30.2 billion in
November.
Domestic non-banks were the only buyers,
and purchased equities worth 31.2 billion
(net) in November, whereas credit institutionsreduced their share portfolios by 30.7 billion
and non-resident investors sold German equi-ties worth 30.3 billion.
Investment fund certificatesThe amount raised by domestic investment
funds came to 36.4 billion in November. That
was slightly below the level of October ( 37.4
billion). Funds open to the general public re-ceived the bulk of the resources ( 35.4 bil-
lion). It was first and foremost share-basedfunds that sold certificates amounting to31.4 billion. Open-end real estate funds re-
ceived 31.3 billion, and money market funds
and bond-based funds received 31.2 billioneach. 31.0 billion (net) was invested in spe-
cialised funds. In November, foreign fund cer-tificates were sold in the German market tothe value of 32.1 billion. The total amount
raised by sales of domestic and foreign invest-ment fund certificates thus came to 38.4 bil-
lion.
The investment fund certificates were mostly
purchased by domestic non-banks ( 36.8 bil-
lion), which mainly bought domestic certifi-cates ( 35.0 billion). Credit institutions and
non-residents purchased certificates amount-ing to 30.8 billion each.Sales and purchases of bonds

12Balance of payments
Germany’s current account – the combined
outcome of foreign trade, services, cross-border factor income and current transfers –ran a slight surplus of 30.1 billion in Novem-
ber compared with a surplus of 34.7 billion
in the previous month. The month-on-monthdecline in the current account surplus wasmainly due to a smaller surplus on trade ingoods but a fall in net factor income alsoplayed a role.
According to calculations by the Federal Stat-
istical Office, there was an export surplus of35.9 billion in November, 33.1 billion less
than the outcome in October. There was alsoa significant month-on-month fall in the for-eign trade balance in seasonally adjustedterms. After the elimination of seasonal fac-tors exports of goods in November were 5%down on the previous month. There is a simi-lar decline (4
12%) when October and No-
vember are taken together and comparedwith the previous two-month period. Thevalue of imported goods in November, bycontrast, exceeded the corresponding figurein October by just under 2% while there wasa 1% decline in a two-month comparison(October-November) with August-September.
The deficit on invisible current transactions
with non-residents increased by 31 billion to
35.1 billion in November compared with Oc-
tober. This was mainly the result of lower netfactor income, which is subject to fairly sharpmonthly fluctuations. Net income in this seg-ment amounted to 30.9 billion in November
compared with 32.2. billion in October. TheMajor items of the balance

13deficit on services ( 33.3 billion) and net ex-
penditure in the field of current transfers(32.7 billion) were in November more or less
the same as in the previous month.
At37.1 billion, net capital imports through
portfolio investment were slightly greater inNovember than in October ( 33.8 billion). For-
eign investors acquired German paper worth314.9 billion, almost exclusively in the form
of bank bonds ( 319.1 billion). This was es-
sentially due to the securitisation of an exist-ing loan. In other segments of the securitiesaccount, by contrast, non-residents reducedtheir investment in Germany, for example, by33.0 billion in the case of money market
paper, 31.8 billion in public bonds and 30.2
billion in shares. German residents invested37.8 billion net in foreign paper during the
month under review; that was about 33 bil-
lion less than in October. Demand was con-centrated mainly on foreign bonds and notes(37.2 billion) and investment fund certificates
(32.1 billion). A small amount of funds also
flowed into the foreign share markets ( 30.5
billion) whereas sales and redemptions pre-dominated in the case of money marketpaper ( 31.9 billion).
Net capital imports ( 31.6 billion) also arose as
a result of direct investment in Novemberwhereas in October a total of 36.1 billion net
had flowed out of Germany. Foreign propri-etors provided their subsidiaries domiciled inGermany with investable funds amounting to30.9 billion. This was exclusively in the form
of additional equity capital. By contrast, Ger-man enterprises reduced their foreign invest-ment by 30.7 billion in the month under re-
view.
All in all, the non-securitised credit transfers
of non-banks resulted in modest outflows ofcapital in November. Enterprises and individ-uals transferred 32.3 billion net abroad,
thereby stocking up their balances with for-eign banks somewhat. By contrast, the publicauthorities imported 31.0 billion net, mainly
through the borrowing of short-term fundsabroad. Large outflows of funds ( 337.8 bil-
lion) predominated in the case of the externalcredit transactions of German banks; theaforementioned replacement of a book creditby a securitised loan played an important,though not the main, role here. 36.7 billion
in foreign funds accrued to the accounts ofthe Bundesbank in November, primarily inconnection with TARGET payments.

clined – at transaction values – by 30.2 billion

15Capital flows and
the exchange rateCross-border capital flows have in-
creased considerably world-wide dur-ing the past few years. Indeed, theyhave grown significantly faster thanmany real economic variables. Thedriving forces behind this developmenthave been the liberalisation and de-regulation of the financial markets aswell as the rapid advance in informa-tion and communications technology,which, in turn, have resulted in a sharpreduction in transaction costs. Devel-opments in international financialtransactions have also been substan-tially stimulated by the increased cross-border integration of corporate finan-cing during the past few years. Finally,the start of European monetary union(EMU) has given rise to far-reachingadjustments in portfolios, which manyobservers have associated with theweakness of the external value of theeuro. Even so, it will be shown belowthat such short-term correlations be-tween the exchange rate and capitalflows cannot be simply interpreted asan automatic process of cause andeffect. In the case of Germany, at allevents, such a relationship has notproved stable over a lengthy period.This article explains the interrelation-ships and describes the “structural”changes in German financial transac-tions against this background.

16Preliminary remarks
Globally recorded capital flows amounted
to US$ 4,000 billion in the year 2000; thismeans that they have increased about30-fold since 1975 whereas during the sameperiod the world trade volume or the aggre-gate real gross domestic product (GDP) of allcountries, for example, has risen by only320% or 140%, respectively.
1Portfolio in-
vestment, especially in shares, and directinvestment have contributed most to thegrowth in cross-border financial transactions.After all, this development is a reflection ofthe ongoing process of economic globalisa-tion. In view of the availability of a wide var-iety of financial market data, the speed andmoderate cost of obtaining them as well asthe substantial increase in the means of stor-ing and processing the information, investorsare including an ever growing volume of for-eign financial products in their portfolio oper-ations, especially as banks, insurance enter-prises and investment companies are often in-volved in asset investment.
2The global inte-
gration of enterprises has also become evencloser as a result of the recent wave of mer-gers and acquisitions at the end of the nine-ties. UNCTAD puts total direct investment inthe year 2000 at almost US$ 1,300 billion.More than 60,000 transnational corporationswith more than 800,000 foreign branches arenow operating world-wide; they account forabout two-thirds of world trade.

It seems reasonable to suppose that there willbe a number of correlations between capitalflows, on the one hand, and other financialvariables, on the other. Movements in ex-change rates and interest rates are the first to
spring to mind. For example, the current ex-change rates and exchange rate expectations– as well as other factors – are no doubtmajor determinants in the calculations ofinternationally operating investors and aretherefore also reflected in the flows of capital.Conversely, capital flows also affect the (ex-pected) movements in exchange rates. How-ever, these relationships are only part of awhole series of interdependent factors, withthe result that it is difficult to find simple cor-1975 = 100, log. scale

17relations which are also clear-cut and lasting
in their effect. For example, exchange rate ex-pectations also influence other financial mar-ket prices, notably interest rates (interest rateparity), and these at least moderate the over-all effect on investment decisions and there-fore on capital movements. It must also beremembered that, by definition, a country’stotal external transactions must always be inbalance; in other words, every capital outflow(inflow) is offset elsewhere in the balance ofpayments by a corresponding inflow (out-flow), with the result that, regarding thefinancial relationships under considerationhere, the sub-balances within the financialaccount are possibly more important than thebalance of the financial account as a whole.
Financial transactions in the euro area
and the euro exchange rate
The temporary spate of funds leaving the
euro area gave a certain amount of credenceto the theory that there is a close connectionbetween financial transactions and the ex-change rate. Financial market observers werequick to point out the parallelism betweenthe (cumulated) net capital exports of theeuro area through portfolio and direct invest-ment and the depreciating trend of theeuro.
4Indeed, from the start of monetary
union until the end of October 2001, the lat-est month for which euro-area balance ofpayments figures are available, a total of ap-proximately 3300 billion net was exported
from the euro area in these two segments. Atthe same time, the effective exchange rate ofthe euro tended to depreciate; at the end ofOctober 2001 it was about 15% lower than
on 4 January 1999. The correlation coefficientbetween the two variables, when based onmonthly figures, amounts to 0.80.
Although the parallelism between cumulated
net capital exports and the depreciating euroexchange rate appears plausible at first sight,this parallelism says nothing about the inter-relationship between the two variables be-cause it may also be due to a third factor. Fur-thermore, the course of the two time series,which seems to follow a downward trend,needs to be analysed more closely. If, there-fore, the monthly euro exchange rate move- 5 billion

18ments are considered instead of the level
of the currency’s effective exchange rate and– in the corresponding month – the net cap-ital exports (through portfolio transactionsand direct investment) instead of the cumu-lated financial account balances, the correl-ation proves to be less convincing than in thecase of the cumulated data. The correlationcoefficient is now only 0.42 for the periodfrom January 1999 to October 2001. The cor-relation between the monthly change in theeuro-dollar exchange rate and the net month-ly capital exports from the euro area is some-what higher (0.45). The US dollar plays a rela-tively significant role in the euro area’s cross-border financial transactions with third coun-tries.
5
Seen as a whole, the results show that theinterrelationships are more complex than theyinitially appear from a simple comparison ofcumulated capital exports and exchangerates. Evidently, other determinants are hav-ing an effect on the financial transactions andexchange rates. However, both the interestrate differential between long-term dollarand euro paper and the relative price move-ments on the US and European share marketsprove, when viewed in their entirety, to be ofless relevance for financial transactions (port-folio and direct investment) than exchangerate movements.
6
These results are confirmed to some extentby empirical studies undertaken by inter-national organisations. For example, the Bankfor International Settlements (BIS) has estab-lished that, although there are close correl-ations between changes in the share marketindices of the United States, on the one
hand, and those of Japan and Germany, onthe other, the exchange rate movement andthe balance of cross-border share transactionsprove in this study to be virtually uncorrelatedin the long term.
7In another study, the IMF,
by contrast, established a significant positivecorrelation between the net bilateral capitalflows arising from EMU-US share markettransactions and the euro-dollar exchangerate. The corresponding estimates for bondsand direct investment, however, are not sig-nificant statistically.

ments, the estimated net bilateral capital outflows (direct
and portfolio investment) from the euro area to the
United States up to the end of September 2001 add up
to the equivalent of approximately 3500 billion; there is
no corresponding regional breakdown of financial trans-
actions in the euro-area balance of payments.
6The correlation coefficients amount to 0.22 in the case
of the interest rate differential and 0.04 in the case of the
relative price movement on the share market. If individual
instruments are examined in the case of portfolio invest-
ment, some of the correlations, for example, those be-
tween the balance of the share transactions and the rela-
tive share market performances of the euro area and the
United States, are actually negative.

transactions of the 11 countries which introduced the
euro on 1 January 1999 are aggregated and calculated
back to 1988. A “synthetic” euro is used to provide an
exchange rate. The different results might also be due to
the fact that – in contrast to the BIS study and the correl-
ation analyses described above, which are based on
monthly figures – the IMF study used quarterly data.Other

19weighted external value of the Deutsche
Mark are also informative in this connection.Between January 1971 and October 2001 thecorrelation coefficient between the combinedbalance arising from direct investment andportfolio transactions and the changes in theexternal value of the Deutsche Mark amount-ed to 0.10.
9Fairly similar results are achieved
even if only the time up to the start of EMU isconsidered or the period of analysis is restrict-ed to the nineties when the financial transac-tion flows in both of the segments mentionedexpanded particularly strongly. This thereforeshows that for Germany, too, the correlationbetween capital flows and exchange ratemovements tends to be slight in the longterm.
A different picture emerges, however, when
the correlations examined here are monitoredfor shorter periods. To this end the correlationwas analysed over a moving observation win-dow of 36 months – which corresponds moreor less to the length of time used as a basisfor the EMU study above. It emerges that thecorrelation coefficient thus defined was muchhigher for a time but that it also fluctuatedsharply over the period, ranging from – 0.35to + 0.60. This means that in the past therewere periods in which – to put it simply – netcapital imports (exports) through portfolioand direct investment tended to be associ-ated – as one would assume – with an appre-ciation (depreciation) of the Deutsche Mark,as happened, for example, at the end of theeighties and the beginning of the nineties.This, however, was not invariably the case.For a time Germany’s net capital imports (ex-ports) – contrary to expectation – also tendedto coincide with a depreciation (appreciation)
of the Deutsche Mark. This type of situationoccurred, for example, in the mid-eightiesand mid-nineties.
Fairly similar results to those obtained here
for the net capital flows arising from directand portfolio investment can also be derivedfor individual sub-items of the financial ac-count. Stable correlations do not arise in thelonger term here either. However, it is inter-esting in this connection that – apart from avery brief period – the correlation betweenvariously defined financial account balancesand monthly exchange rate movements wasalmost zero in recent years. This is particularlytrue of portfolio transactions, notably trans-actions in bonds.
Significant structural changes had an impact
on Germany’s financial transactions duringthe period under review, and these alteredthe correlation between financial transactionsand the exchange rate. With the introductionof the euro, for example, the exchange raterisk completely disappeared for a significantpart of German financial transactions, namelythose within the single currency area. This re-sulted in German investors reorganising theirportfolios – especially through increased pur-chases of bonds issued in other euro-areacountries. However, it might also explain whyit has recently become virtually impossible todiscern any correlation between an exchangerate movement and the balance arising fromdirect investment and portfolio transactions.Furthermore, the globalisation of financial

on the German financial account. The signifi-cance that the transactions within the euroarea have for the German financial accountand what other changes this account hadundergone in the nineties are thereforeexamined below.The role of EMU in Germany’s financial
account
The present euro-area countries have played
a major role in Germany’s financial accountfor quite some time. In the seventies 26%and in the eighties 36% of Germany’s finan-cial investments abroad flowed into thesepartner countries. During the run-up to stagethree of monetary union and even more sowith the introduction of the euro at the be-ginning of 1999 financial integration withthese countries grew further. In the period ofjust under three years following the start ofEMU for which a regional statistical break-down of capital flows is currently availableGerman banks, enterprises, individuals andpublic authorities invested about 3450 billion
there. This means that between January 1999and September 2001 the euro-area countriesaccounted for about 47% of German finan-cial investment abroad. In the opposite direc-tion, i.e. the statistically recorded foreign in-vestment in Germany, the proportion of in-vestors from other euro-area countries de-clined to only 4%, by contrast. Prior to theintroduction of the euro this proportion ona longer-term average had been approxi-mately one-quarter. However, special statistic-al anomalies play a role here, and these willbe dealt with in more detail below.
The main reason for the fact that recently al-
most one-half of German financial invest-ment abroad flowed into other euro-areacountries was the trend in portfolio transac-tions, which are still more strongly geared tothe euro area than other segments of the fi-nancial account. Since the beginning of mon-Correlation coefficients 1

ance, invested two out of every three eurosspent on acquiring securities abroad in thepartner countries. This strong EMU orienta-tion applies in particular to investment fundcertificates (EMU share 94%). The reason isthat from the German point of view the mostimportant foreign fund companies are estab-lished in Luxembourg and Ireland. However,the euro-area countries also attract by far thelargest share (78%) of German bond pur-chases abroad. It is precisely in bonds andnotes, which in terms of value represent themost important segment of portfolio invest-ment, that the EMU share has risen steeplysince the introduction of the euro eventhough German residents had already invest-ed enthusiastically in issues by other (poten-tial) euro-area countries in the months priorto that in expectation of profit-taking fromthe interest rate convergence in the “high-yielding” countries (“convergence trade”).German savers concentrate less on the euroarea when investing in the share marketabroad; only 38% of this form of investmentflowed into the other euro-area countrieswhile the United States and the United King-dom, whose share markets are among theworld leaders in terms of market capitalisa-tion and market liquidity, each absorbed27%.
In contrast to the case with German portfolio
investment abroad, the regional statisticalbreakdown of non-residents’ securities acqui-sitions in Germany is not very informative ineconomic terms because the regional classifi-cation has to be made according to the im-mediate counterparty’s country of domicileand not according to the ultimate investor.
For that reason, neither the purchases of Ger-man securities by non-residents nor the salesand redemptions can be reliably classified byregion. The extent of the problem becomesclear when it is remembered that since thestart of EMU all foreign investors, taken to-gether, have purchased German paper worthmore than 3300 billion net while – according
to the statistics – investors whose domicile or

countries reduced their net holdings of Ger-man securities by 3200 billion. Evidently a
substantial amount of German paper held byinvestors outside the euro area was resold orredeemed through institutions in other euro-area countries – irrespective of who had oncepurchased or held the paper. The large custo-dians of securities in Belgium and Luxem-bourg are among those playing a significantrole here.
With respect to direct investment, capital
flows appear to have been moving in the op-posite direction from those in portfolio trans-actions in a way. In this case it is mainly in-vestors from other euro-area countries thatare becoming increasingly important for Ger-many. Since 1999 more than two-thirds offoreign direct investment in Germany hasbeen coming from these countries, notablyfrom the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxem-bourg where major holding companies are lo-cated. In some cases, however, investors fromcountries outside the euro area are also asso-ciated with these holding companies.
The proportion of German outward invest-
ment in the euro area is much less, by con-trast, and for some time it has also beentending to fall. Since the start of monetaryunion only 7% of German enterprises’ for-eign direct investment has flowed into theother euro-area countries. This is linked to thefact that in the past few years German enter-prises have been acquiring firms in the UnitedStates and the United Kingdom and this hasabsorbed an extremely large amount of theirinvestable funds. In the case of direct invest-ment, moreover, credit transactions with for-
eign subsidiaries in the euro area have recent-ly been playing a major role, and the outcomeof this has been a reduction in the (financial)investment of German enterprises in the sin-gle currency area (reverse flows). Finally, itmust not be forgotten that during their prep-arations for the single European market Ger-man firms invested heavily in the partnercountries at the end of the eighties and thebeginning of the nineties and therefore hadalready consolidated their position in thesecountries at that time. For example, morethan 50% of German direct investmentabroad flowed into the current euro-areacountries between 1988 and 1994.
The introduction of the euro is likewise clearly
reflected in the structure of the other finan-cial transactions, which at present are largelycharacterised by the short-term credit trans-actions of banks. Since January 1999 Germancreditors have granted 42% of their non-securitised foreign loans to borrowers inother euro-area countries whereas only 16%of the loans raised abroad have come fromthese countries. Most of the foreign funds ac-cruing to German banks in particular havearisen through operations with countries out-side the euro area; at the same time, thebanks have been granting (net) loans to bor-rowers in other euro-area countries.

23countries have for Germany’s financial ac-
count, especially in the case of capital out-flows, it is not surprising that the correlationbetween capital flows and the exchange ratehas been comparatively low recently. Even ifnot all capital movements within the euroarea are denominated in euro, the vast major-ity are. Other factors then play the key role ininvestors’ decision-making considerations.
Structural changes in the German
financial account
Besides the effects of the introduction of the
euro, the German financial account was sub-jected in the nineties to other major structuralchanges which affected the relationships be-tween capital flows and the exchange rate.Two developments immediately spring tomind:
– firstly, the significant increase in the finan-
cial flows to and from Germany whichhad begun in the mid-eighties and accel-erated again during the second half of thenineties;
– secondly, the fact that Germany was a net
capital importer in the nineties whereaspreviously capital exports had predomin-ated.
The increasing financial integration of the
German economy internationally becomesclear from the steep rise in cross-border cap-ital flows in both directions. Whereas theaverage annual German capital investmentabroad in the seventies was still below 3% ofGDP (or the equivalent of approximately 315billion), in the year 2000 it amounted to ap-
proximately 3350 billion, or just over 17% of
GDP; the ratios for foreign capital investmentin Germany are similar. These growth ratesare largely due to developments in portfolioinvestment and in direct investment.
Advancing globalisation of the financial mar-
kets and the resultant diversification of invest-ments as well as the increasing securitisationof assets and liabilities provided portfolio in-vestment with a particularly strong stimulus.In the past ten years alone gross turnover insecurities has increased more than tenfold. Inthe year 2000 it was three and a half timesgreater than gross domestic product. Institu-tional investors, who traditionally invest moreheavily in foreign securities than private in-vestors and who have further increased theirforeign investments over the past few years,are playing a major role in the growing pro-cess of international financial integration.
11
Lower information and transaction costs, thegreatly increased means of data analysis andthe widening range of hedging instrumentshave stimulated growth in Germany’s cross-border portfolio transactions. This develop-ment presumably took place quite independ-ently of the interest rate and exchange ratemovements.
An upswing akin to that in portfolio flows
can also be observed in direct investment.Whereas German direct investment abroadand foreign direct investment in Germanyhad both been below 1% of GDP for the

24most part until the middle of the nineties,
they increased discernibly after that. In theyear 2000 non-residents’ acquisition of par-ticipating interests in Germany amounted tono less than 9
12% of GDP (or 3191 billion).12
The wave of corporate acquisitions and the
unusually high valuation of many high-techfirms on the share markets until the spring of2000 also greatly inflated the direct invest-ment flows to and from Germany. However,both developments are – or were – also a re-flection of a repositioning of many enterpriseswith respect to global competition. Anotherfactor is that for the past few years intra-group credit transactions have played a sig-nificant role in the figures on direct invest-ment shown in the German balance ofpayments. These flows often have more todo with company-specific liquidity consider-ations and less with locational policy or theor-
etical portfolio calculations. That apart, thesurge in direct investment recorded up to lastyear has again petered out following thesharp fall in share prices and the global cyclic-al downturn. However, the tax relief meas-ures that came into force at the beginning ofJanuary 2002 might provide new stimuli forsales of corporate participating interests.

12This peak figure arose as a result of one unusually

the importance of foreign direct investment in Germany.

duced German direct investment abroad, with the result
that German outward investment was comparatively low

not do so until after its price competitivenesshad improved as a result of exchange ratemovements, increased productivity and com-paratively moderate wage agreements. Con-versely, German firms – for a wide variety ofmotives – have long been extremely interest-ed in extending their presence abroad.
13This
ultimately meant that Germany “traditional-ly” recorded net capital exports through dir-ect investment; in that respect, the year 2000with its large net capital inflows was an ex-ception for the reasons described.
Generally speaking, a remarkable turnaround
occurred in the German financial account inthe nineties, especially in the first half of thedecade. Whereas capital amounting to theequivalent of more than 3270 billion (net)was exported between 1981 and 1990, Ger-
many had to draw on foreign funds with anequivalent net value of approximately 3120
billion during the next ten years owing to thelarge need for finance following Germanreunification. This remarkable swing in thefinancial account reflects a correspondingreversal in the current account, which, aftersubstantial surpluses at the end of the eight-ies, slipped appreciably into deficit as a resultof reunification and did not run a small sur-plus again until last year, according to the fig-ures so far available.Balances

26This change in the direction of financial flows
is particularly pronounced in (non-securitised)credit transactions, in which large inflows offunds were recorded during the past decade(approximately 3250 billion net). The oper-
ations of enterprises and individuals accountfor the smaller part of this turnaround.Owing to the liquidity advantages of the“Euromarket”, the minimum reserve burdenon German bank deposits and the debate ontaxing capital income in Germany, these twogroups invested fairly large net sums abroaduntil about the middle of the nineties. Subse-quently, however, they imported funds onbalance. The banks’ external transactions,which have expanded extraordinarily sharplyduring the past few years as a result of theGerman credit institutions’ greater inter-national orientation, were of much greaterimportance in terms of value, however. Thebanks’ external liabilities, in particular, haverisen considerably, with the result that, over-all, the banking system has recorded substan-tial inflows of funds through unsecuritisedcredit transactions (from 1991 to 2000: ap-proximately 3270 billion net). These net cap-
ital imports ultimately represented the coun-terpart to the outgoing payments in the otherareas of the balance of payments, notablytransactions in the current account and directinvestment.Conclusion
Events on the international financial markets
occur amid the interplay of individual decisionsmade by a large number of actors who, fortheir part, plan and trade against the back-ground of legal, political and technologicalconditions which are continually in flux. Thecapital movements and exchange rates thatare observed are the result of these marketprocesses and structural changes. They co-existwith other variables in a close reciprocatinginterrelationship. As a rule, simple unidimen-sional relationships are therefore found at bestin the short term. Experience shows that theyare not a reliable basis for forecasts or guidelinefor political action. This also applies to the cor-relations between the euro exchange rate andthe net capital flows arising in the euro area asa result of direct investment and securitiestransactions. While it is perfectly plausible thatfuture capital imports into the euro area mightbe linked to an appreciation of the euro, ex-perience in Germany has shown that this is notnecessarily the case. Even so, the fact that,with the abatement of the wave of mergers,the euro-area financial account has actually im-proved since mid-2001 and that, at the sametime, the euro has gained ground on a weight-ed average is consistent with a positive correl-ation.

27The housing market
during the ninetiesIn the past decade, the German hous-
ing market has been characterisedby marked vicissitudes and structuralchanges. In the late eighties and earlynineties, substantial immigration ledto a sharp rise in the demand for hous-ing in western Germany. Constructionactivity, reinforced by government pro-motional measures, increased distinct-ly, and prices went up strongly. Withthe ebbing of the immigration waveand the expansion of the supply ofhousing, conditions eased noticeablyin the second half of the decade, aswas reflected in the sluggish move-ment of rents.
In eastern Germany, the manifestly
poor stock of buildings, out of linewith the demand, at the time of reuni-fication and – as was generally sup-posed – the inadequate supply sparkedoff a distinct surge in construction ac-tivity. Fostered by massive governmentpromotion, there began a constructionboom that initially paid little heed tothe aspect of the sustainability of re-turns on investment. The ensuing set-back was all the more pronounced andprotracted. The adjustment processwill continue in the current year aswell. In the new Länder, the construc-tion industry is therefore increasinglyforfeiting the outstanding position itonce had there.

28The structural features
of the housing market
In the past ten years, the German housing
market has presented a very variable picture.If the early years of that period were markedby signs of shortage, later on a virtual balancewas reached between supply and demand onthe market as a whole. The adjusting andbalancing processes on the housing market,compared with conditions on many othermerchandise markets and the financial mar-kets, are generally characterised by a numberof specific structural features. They are due inlarge part to the fact that supply is mainlydetermined by the housing stock, and islocation-specific, which, in the short run, setsstrict limits to the elasticity of supply. The factthat the housing market is in many respects avery imperfect market, in terms of ideal mar-ket forms, owes something to the heterogen-eity of the types of buildings and kinds ofhousing, to the specific conditions of thehousing environment and to the problem ofthe limited divisibility of the assets. The up-shot is high transaction costs and rather low“market liquidity”. The fairly loose associ-ation of market segments results not infre-quently in a temporal juxtaposition of a goodsupply situation, supply bottlenecks and over-supply in different segments of the market.
High capital tie-ups and a long service life are
likewise among the distinguishing features ofthe housing market. Hence investment deci-sions are highly future-oriented, and there-fore inevitably pose a particular degree ofrisk. For instance, the expected average ser-vice life of a residential building erected in1995, according to the official capital-stock
account, is 74 years, compared with 52 yearsfor industrial buildings and 13 years for ma-chinery and equipment.
Moreover, the construction of new housing is
both costly and time-consuming. That is notjust a matter of the construction phaseproper; instead, the public sector is likewiseinvolved in the context of building supervisionand in the provision of the requisite infra-structure. Especially in the declaration anddevelopment of new building land, consider-able periods may elapse because of conflict-ing interests.
In view of the long space of time over which
capital is tied up in housing, the long-terminterest-rate factor, too, is a major element ininvestors’ calculations, either in the contextof a strict comparison of the returns and risks(including changes in value) posed by invest-ment vehicles, or – especially in the case ofowner-occupied housing – in the form ofdebt-service expenditure and rent paymentssaved. Often, however (especially during thenineties), the interest-rate effect is obscuredby changes in the underlying tax and gov-ernment-promotion conditions. Demand-sidecyclical influences, which come into play pri-marily via the reassessment of longer-term in-come expectations, likewise curb the effect-iveness of the “interest-rate channel”.
The capital good “housing” is an economic
asset or store of value that can be used bothas a consumer good and as productive cap-ital. Regardless of the use to which it is putand its ownership, housing (excluding land)

29constitutes the largest segment of aggregate
fixed assets, which comprise the total stockof durable reproducible assets. On the basisof net fixed assets at replacement cost, at thebeginning of 2001 almost 49% of the aggre-gate capital stock was held in the form ofhousing, compared with barely 45% at thestart of 1991. This reflects, besides the gener-ally high esteem which the asset “housing”enjoys, and which is likewise mirrored in thecomposition of households’ assets, the highcost and long service life of real property.Given the size of the housing stock, even astrong investment year in residential con-struction appears relatively insignificant bycomparison. If only for that reason, evensmall rates of change in demand can barelybe offset in the short run, even if theresponse of construction activity is vigorous.
Altogether, it is due to the profusion of deter-
minants and players in the housing market,and to their complex interactions, that, evenwhen the overall situation can be said to bein balance, major disequilibria regularly super-vene for prolonged periods in certain marketsegments, and soon spark off calls for gov-ernment intervention, with an allusion to thesupposedly particularly meritorious nature ofthe service “utilisation of housing”. Especiallyin regional terms, differences of varying in-tensity are manifest, both in a more small-scale approach between conurbations andtheir surrounding areas and rural districts andon a broader geographical scale, e.g. be-tween Länder. In view of the (until very re-cently) highly divergent market conditionsobtaining in western and eastern Germany, itwill often be necessary in the following pagesto break down the overall analysis accord-
ingly.

30tion, which had previously declined some-
what, had stabilised at around 61 million in-habitants by the middle of the decade. Com-pared with the peak level at the start of thedecade, that implied a decrease of over650,000 people, or slightly more than 1%.
1
The slackening of demand pressures was ac-companied by a distinct slowdown in rentrises. On the basis of the consumer-priceindex for all households, the year-on-yearincrease in rents for housing and garagesreached its lowest level during the eighties in1987, at 1.6%; compared with its peak in1983, that represented a decline to less thanone-third of the former rate of growth. Thepurchase prices of owner-occupied housesand apartments, which had gone up steeplyin the preceding years, actually decreasedsomewhat. Putting up additional housing be-came dramatically less attractive. In 1988, as
the official statistics show, barely 210,000new housing units were completed. That wasthe lowest figure in the history of the FederalRepublic. In 1986, the total stock of housingunits came to just over 27 million, accordingto an extrapolation by the Federal StatisticalOffice. That meant that, in arithmetical terms,there were only 2.2 inhabitants per unit, com-pared with 2.4 at the beginning of the eight-ies and 2.9 at the beginning of the seven-ties. Correspondingly, in 1986 there were445 housing units for every 1,000 inhabitants.
However, it was to turn out a short time later,
when the results of the 1987 building andhousing census were released, that the ex-trapolation was rather imprecise. Extant atthe date of the survey were only 26.3 millionhousing units. The difference from the ex-trapolation is explained by the fact that, al-though detailed statistical data on additionsto the housing stock are available, the infor-mation on retirements from that stock is in-complete. Such information comprises onlythe reported demolitions of housing, but notlosses of housing due to redesignations oramalgamations.

tion tends to overstate the number of hous-ing units available.million

1When determining the demand for housing, the num-
ber of households is of course the prime consideration;
but the relevant figures, obtained from the official statis-
tics, show breaks over time that are difficult to account
for. Hence the present analysis is based mainly, as a
makeshift, on the resident population, which constitutes,
so to speak, the demographic framework for housing de-
mand.
2If the overestimate of just over one million housing
units is distributed over the period between the 1968
and 1987 housing censuses, the annual retirements of
housing were about 70,000 higher than assumed in the
official extrapolation.1987 housing

31Although the new interpretation of the statis-
tics made no difference to the real supplysituation, the suddenly discovered “shortfall”was largely responsible for the impressionthat there was a lack of housing. That impres-sion did not gain a real backdrop until therewas a massive growth in immigration towestern Germany. In the six years between1988 and 1993, 1
12million ethnic Germans
from eastern Europe, about 1 million mi-grants from the new Länder and almost1
12million asylum-seekers entered the terri-
tory of the former Federal Republic. Despitethe continuing excess of deaths over births,in 1993 the average resident population ex-ceeded the level of 1988 by more than 4 mil-lion, and the figure of 65 million was out-stripped for the first time in 1995. Accordingto the data of the “microcensus”, the num-ber of households increased in that period byalmost one-tenth, or approximately 2
34mil-
lion.
Signs of an increasing tightening of the mar-
ket were reflected in apartment rents, too.Whereas the rise in rents, according to the of-ficial yardstick of the consumer-price index,had slackened to 1.6% a year by 1987, itaccelerated in the following years to a peakof almost 6% (in 1993), with the result thatthe gap vis-à-vis the general inflation ratecame to 1
12percentage points. Altogether,
rents went up by just over one-quarter withina good half-decade. At the top of the tablewere apartments in older buildings, althoughpublicly-assisted and privately-financed resi-dential construction was not far behind. Simi-larly steep rises in rents had last been record-ed early in the seventies. Housing costs perhousehold increased from almost 16% of dis-
posable income to about 20%.
In view of these developments, the govern-
ment saw fit to foster the construction ofnew housing by means of a whole series ofpromotional measures. The centrepiece wasformed by substantial depreciation facilitiesfor the construction of rented housing. Inaddition, the volume of programmes in thefield of social welfare housing constructionwas markedly expanded again, after a periodof retrenchment. The number of sponsoredhousing units, which had fallen below 40,000in the second half of the eighties, rose attimes at the beginning of the following dec-ade to over 110,000 units.
Not least for that reason, the consequent
housing demand soon led to a strong revivalof construction activity. As early as 1990, thenumber of housing units authorised wastwice as high as in 1987; by 1994 it had in-creased again by almost 200,000. That wasthe highest level of the past two decades.The same thing also applies to the number ofcompletions. 500,000 new housing units ayear came on the market in both 1994 and1995. In particular, the construction of apart-ment blocks was stepped up. Whereas, in1990, more housing units had been erectedin the form of owner-occupied houses (build-ings with one or two apartments) than in thatof apartment blocks (buildings with threeor more apartments), in 1994–95 apartmentblocks outstripped owner-occupied housesby 50%. Over one-half of the former wereowner-occupied apartments (condominiums),which are mostly intended to be let. There-Strong

32after, the total stock of housing units grew
to 28.9 million, according to calculations bythe Federal Statistical Office. Notwithstandingthe steep growth of the population, thehousing situation improved; the number ofhousing units available for every 1,000 inhab-itants rose to over 435.
Simultaneously with the increase in activity,
construction costs shot up despite the expan-sion of capacity. In the six years from 1988 to1993, expenditure – as measured by the Fed-eral Statistical Office’s overall construction-price index for residential buildings – went upby nearly one-third, equivalent to an averageannual rise of over 4
12%. Between 1982 and
1987, the annual growth rate had been bare-ly 2%. Land prices likewise began to moveperceptibly upwards. According to the Fed-eral Statistical Office, in the middle of the
decade, the prices of land ready for buildingwere about one-fifth higher than at the startof the period. Broker organisations and otherobservers of the real property market actuallyascertained price rises of almost one-third forbuilding sites in good residential areas.
In the new Länder, housing construction ac-
tivity was cut back drastically in the first fewyears after German reunification. In 1992 thenumber of housing units completed reachedan all-time low of approximately 11,500units.

33per 10,000 inhabitants. During the eighties
(when construction intensity, in numericalterms, actually exceeded that in western Ger-many), as many as 54 housing units had beencompleted for every 10,000 inhabitants. Inview of the reduced construction activity atthe start of the nineties, the housing stock,according to calculations by the Federal Stat-istical Office, hardly increased any more, andremained at about 7 million units for severalyears. Even so, in arithmetical terms, the sup-ply of housing improved in that period, aboveall because the population contracted owingto heavy emigration.
It would, however, be wrong to infer from
these figures that the supply situation on thehousing market was good, particularly inqualitative terms. As a matter of fact, the sup-ply (in terms of both quality and structure) felldistinctly short of the demand, as it had trad-itionally done already in the GDR. A substan-tial proportion of the housing units could notbe let or sold. According to estimates by theCommission for Structural Change in Housingin the New Länder,
4approximately 420,000
housing units were vacant in 1990 becausethey were either dilapidated or had other ser-ious shortcomings. In 1993, the official statis-tics came to a similar conclusion. That meantthat about 6% of all housing units were, ineffect, not available for residence. By 1998the number of vacant units, which by thenalso included unlet apartments in new build-ings, had increased to about 1 million, or over13% of the housing stock.
Initially, the vacant housing resulted above all
from the fact that, in the view of the GDRleadership, the preservation of historic town
centres was not worth fostering. Private ini-tiatives to repair and refurbish old buildingswere hampered, if not indeed prevented. In-stead, housing promotion concentrated spe-cifically on the creation of new building es-tates in industrial centres. On grounds of ex-pense and time, prefabricated industrial con-struction methods were employed for prefer-ence. The prefabricated style of apartmentblocks offered distinctly more comfort thanmany apartments in old buildings did, whichmade the former comparatively popular inthe GDR; but the size of the apartments andthe environment of the blocks mostly fell sig-nificantly short of west German standards,and of the wishes of east German residents.Housing completions

34Under the impact of the scarcity on the hous-
ing market, and in the light of the generallydilapidated state of the housing stock, con-struction activity was massively stepped up atfirst in the mid-nineties. Special stimuli wereimparted by extensive government promo-tion, including tax concessions, financial sub-sidies and cut-price loans. The number ofbuilding permits rose from 5,500 in 1991 toover 185,000 in 1996. Housing completionsreached a peak, at just under 178,000, in1997. At 430 new housing units per 10,000inhabitants in five years, construction outputfar exceeded the figure of 310 housing unitsrecorded during the construction boom inwestern Germany early in the seventies. Ac-cording to the official statistics, the “advan-tage” of the new Länder – in terms of thestock of housing units per 1,000 inhabit-ants – rose from 3
12% at the beginning of
the nineties to about 10% at the end of thedecade. Even if one takes account of theCommission’s assumption that about one-half of the vacant housing units (i.e. nearlyhalf-a-million units) are no longer utilisableowing to constructional shortcomings, andare no longer being offered on the market,the supply – as measured by quantitativeyardsticks – in eastern Germany is to this dayhigher than that in the old Länder.
In search of a new equilibrium
In the second half of the nineties, a progres-
sive slackening of construction activity beganon account of the distinct convergence ofsupply and demand. In the year 2000 in west-ern Germany, the number of potential con-struction projects documented in the form ofconstruction permits dropped to one-half ofthe peak level recorded in 1994; in the newLänder, the figure fell to only one-third. Thefact that market equilibrium had improvednoticeably was also reflected in the develop-ment of rents. According to the official pricesurvey, the rise in housing rents in Germanyin 1999 decelerated to little more than 1%.Such low rates have not been recorded in thiscountry in the past four decades.
One of the reasons for the decreasing de-
mand for housing was unquestionably thefact that population movements diminishedperceptibly. Whereas the number of inhabit-ants continued to grow in the old Länder, al-though the pace of the rise slowed downmarkedly, the resident population of the eastHousing units per 1,000 inhabitants

35German Länder has gone down right up to
the present. Old industrial locations, in par-ticular, registered strong waves of emigration.Moreover, in many places former residents ofprefabricated apartment blocks moved tomore up-to-date rented housing or houses oftheir own, which are more in line with theirwishes. The massive amount of investment,specifically in east German residential con-struction, was thus largely responsible for thedistinct increase in the vacancy rate overtime. Since, under current market conditions,many of the vacant apartments can no longerbe let, the demolition of quite a number ofthe buildings will be unavoidable.
Under the impact of the easier market condi-
tions, Parliament has gradually reduced thegovernment promotion of residential con-struction; in particular, it has repealed someof the preferential tax depreciation condi-tions. Moreover, the option of offsetting, forincome-tax purposes, losses from letting andleasing against other income was curtailed,land-transfer tax was raised and what wasknown as the “deduction of preliminaryexpenses” was abolished. The speculationperiod for gains from the sale of private landnot used by the purchaser was extendedfrom two years to ten. In addition, in the con-text of a tenancy-law reform, the cappinglimit for rent increases was lowered andperiods of notice for terminating leases wereshortened, to the benefit of tenants.
It was no doubt largely because of that pack-
age of measures, along with the market-induced slowdown in rent rises, that manypotential investors critically reconsidered theiryield expectations with respect to residential
property. Since, however, the financial mar-kets were offering attractive alternative in-vestments at the same time, in many cases re-tirements from the housing market may havebeen due to that factor, too. The constructionof apartment blocks, which pays much great-er heed to yield considerations than the build-ing of owner-occupied houses, was particu-larly hard hit. In the old Länder, the numberof housing units approved in buildings withthree or more such units dropped from over315,000 in 1994 to no more than 90,000 in2000. That roughly conformed to the levelof the late eighties. In eastern Germany, onlyabout one-seventh of the peak level recordedin 1995 was reached, when almost 105,000housing units were approved. In the field ofowner-occupied houses, which here comprisebuildings with one and two apartments, de-mand has moderated distinctly since spring2000. That may have owed something to thelowering of the income limits for the grantingof the owner-occupied housing allowance.
Of late, however, there have been signs of a
further tightening of certain segments of themarket. In some conurbations, the supply ofrented housing is becoming scarcer; accord-ing to the associations, rents are rising per-ceptibly again when new agreements areconcluded. Inexpensive and large-sized apart-ments are hardly obtainable. Another reasonwhy the construction of owner-occupiedhouses is becoming more expensive is thatonly limited space is being made available forresidential development. In the somewhatlonger run, however, a shortage of housing,notwithstanding extra demand due to afflu-

36ence and a demand for diversified investment
vehicles, may be prevented by the noticeabledecline and progressive ageing of the popula-tion. In view of the long service life of realproperty, such a development, even if its im-pact is not felt in full until future decades, willnot be disregarded in investment decisionstaken in the housing market.
Even so, housing construction is likely to re-
main the most important branch of the con-struction sector. Measured by construction in-vestment within the national accounts, in theyear 2000 almost 60% was accounted for bythat sector in Germany. The proportion wasactually somewhat higher in the old Länder,while it came to just over 45% in easternGermany. That also owes something to theheavy expenditure on improving the public in-frastructure in the eastern part of Germany.Notwithstanding that, the influence of resi-dential construction on the overall economythere is still distinctly higher than in the oldLänder. An estimated just over one-tenth ofthe aggregate value added must be attrib-uted to construction output; in western Ger-many, this figure is just over 6
12%. That ex-
plains why developments in housing con-struction, for good or ill, have a considerableimpact on the overall performance of theGerman economy. While the boom in hous-ing construction in the first half of the nine-ties contributed, in arithmetical terms, almost
12percentage point to the annual growth of
real GDP , in the second half the net result wasa negative balance of almost
12percentage
point per annum.The construction sector is a major factor, not
only in aggregate output but also in employ-ment. In 2001 no less than almost 7% of thetotal labour force, corresponding to about2
12million persons, found employment in
that industry, which is one of the mostlabour-intensive in the producing sector. Justunder 30% of them came from the new Län-der. Particularly there, during the boom in thefirst half of the nineties, the construction in-dustry offered jobs to many wage and salaryearners who had lost their previous employ-ment. In many cases, however, those pos-itions were not permanent. Approximatelyone-third of the distinctly more than one mil-lion jobs have meanwhile had to be sacrificedto structural adjustment. In the old Länder,too, many jobs have been shed as a result ofthe slowdown in construction activity. In Ger-many as a whole, the size of the labour forcein the construction sector had decreasedby over half-a-million, or nearly 20%, bythe year 2001 since its peak in 1995, when3
14million persons were employed.
If the new residential construction orders
reaching the construction industry are takenas a yardstick, the downswing graduallyseems to be coming to a halt. At any rate,business has stabilised at a low level since themiddle of last year. That applies equally to theold and the new Länder. In particular, theconstruction of owner-occupied houses inwestern Germany is acting as a buttress ofconstruction activity. If, moreover, the rentedhousing market tightens further, especially inthe conurbations, and rent increases can beimposed, the nadir of construction activitymight gradually be reached, at least in the oldConstruction

39Credit institutions’
capital viewedfrom a businessand a regulatoryperspectiveRisk and equity capital are two key
concepts both in the management of abank’s business and in prudential regu-lation. With regard to creditor and sys-temic protection, they are closely andinseparably linked. Adequate capitalcover cushions individual banks againstlosses and contributes towards thestability of the banking system as awhole. At the same time, the amountof capital held limits the extent of risk-bearing operations. Hence an individ-ual bank’s risk position determines thelevel of capital it needs from both abusiness and a regulatory perspective.Regulatory and internal (economic)capital requirements differ, however.Although today’s prudential capitalrules are based on banks’ best prac-tices, they cannot be tailored to banks’individual circumstances. The declaredaim of the Basel Committee on Bank-ing Supervision is to closely align theregulatory capital requirements withbanks’ economic capital requirementsthrough new capital rules (Basel II).But for capital to perform the afore-mentioned protective functions, thedisclosed amount must be actuallyavailable. It is therefore crucial thatbanks’ assets and liabilities are valuedaccurately and do not contain any hid-den losses.

40Creditor and systemic protection
through capital
Stipulating the amount of capital which
banks are required to hold remains one of themain instruments of banking supervision witha view to upholding the soundness and abilityto function both of individual institutions andthe overall financial system. Adequate capitalcover is necessary to protect institutions incase they incur losses resulting from theirbusiness operations and to safeguard theirsolvency vis-à-vis customers and creditors.That is why section 10 (1) of the Banking Actrequires that: “In order to meet their obliga-tions to their creditors, and particularly inorder to safeguard the assets entrusted tothem, institutions must have adequate ownfunds.” Like the regulatory provisions of theBanking Act (BA), the accounting rules of theGerman Commercial Code (CC) are primarilygeared to protecting creditors.
Equity capital requirements directly limit the de-
gree of credit institutions’ debt financing. Tothe extent that losses can be absorbed by cap-ital, the institution’s continued existence, andthus its liquidity, are assured. In principle, abank could ensure its perpetual solvency byrelying totally on equity financing; by contrast,a certain degree of debt financing implies apositive default probability commensurate withthe credit institution’s risk position.
Components of capital
The Banking Act defines three categories of
own funds, which differ in their ability tocover losses: core capital, additional capital
(which together constitute the liable capital)and tier 3 capital. This regulatory definition ofcapital is broader than that contained in theGerman Commercial Code, although the lat-ter concept is the starting point. The ongoinginternational development of accountingstandards will therefore also have an impacton regulatory capital, since Basel II will leavethe recognised own funds components un-changed until further notice.
The equity capital measure which institutions
themselves use for managing their businessoperations bank-wide (economic capital) isusually not fully identical either to their cap-ital as shown in the balance sheet or to thedefinition of regulatory capital. A bank’s eco-nomic capital is inevitably shaped by the sub-jective judgements of its managers. The waybanks assess the risk-sustainability (maturity,valuation reserves) of their liabilities may dif-fer from the commercial-law provisions or theregulatory provisions. On the other hand,institutions are keen to clearly signal theircreditworthiness to outsiders, for instance bygaining a certain rating grade from one ofthe big agencies. The upshot of this is thatmost banks use a concept of capital for oper-ational purposes which is close to their bal-ance sheet capital or to the concept of corecapital as defined in the Banking Act (seechart on page 41).

42Balance sheet capital
Function and derivation of capital
under the Commercial Code
The definition of liable capital used in the
Banking Act creates a specific regulatory con-cept of capital which differs from the morenarrowly defined concept of balance sheetcapital as used in the German CommercialCode. According to the balance sheet classi-fication system defined in the CommercialCode, equity capital comprises subscribedcapital, capital reserves and revenue reserves,other reserves created by virtue of law orcompany statutes plus the net profit (or loss)for the year. From a regulatory point of view,these components constitute core capital.The fund for general banking risks, which forprudential purposes is likewise recognised as
core capital, is shown separately from theequity capital item in the balance sheet. Theregulatory category of additional capital, inthe form of participation rights and subordin-ated liabilities, is classified as debt in the bal-ance sheet.
The Commercial Code does not give a legal
definition for the equity capital to be shownin the balance sheet. Instead, the balancesheet (or implied) equity capital is derived as aresidual after subtracting total debt plus de-ferred income from total assets plus prepaidexpenses. The disclosure and valuation rulesmust be observed in the definition and valu-ation of the asset and debt items in the bal-ance sheet. There is a certain blurring of dis-tinctions, however. Firstly, not all of the cap-ital components that are effectively availableto the company are recorded under theequity capital item on the balance sheet. Sec-ondly, it is impossible in practice to cleanlydivide all liability-side items into equity ordebt. Thus items classified as debt in the bal-ance sheet may actually contain other equitycomponents (e.g. provisions for future ex-penses or the special reserves), or the dis-closed equity capital may contain capitaliseditems that are not assets at all but simplyaccounting conveniences (e.g. goodwill). Forbalance sheet analysis, in particular, such ef-fects on the disclosed capital therefore needto be taken into consideration in a separateaccount.

43through appropriate write-downs and value
adjustments is an indispensable condition forensuring that equity capital, computed in thebalance sheet as a residual item, is accuratelycalculated and so performs its function ofcreditor protection. This is assured by theproper application of the existing Germanand European accounting rules. An inter-national harmonisation of the concept ofcapital also requires the harmonisation of ac-counting rules as the basis for defining cap-ital. A methodology of valuing assets thatcontains no hidden losses has likewise alreadybeen conceptually implemented in inter-nationally accepted accounting standards.
Implications of the internationalisation
of accounting regimes
The Act to Facilitate International Equity
Financing (Kapitalaufnahmeerleichterungsge-
setz), which entered into force in April 1998,
introduced a new paragraph into the GermanCommercial Code in the form of section292a. It grants certain parent companieswhich compile consolidated accounts accord-ing to internationally accepted accountingstandards an exemption up to 2004 from therequirement to submit an additional set ofgroup-wide accounts according to Germanaccounting principles. This marked a turningpoint with regard to traditional German ac-counting practices based on the CommercialCode. From the present perspective it seemslikely that this new trend will continue. TheEU Commission has meanwhile submitted aproposal for the further harmonisation of EUaccounting rules. It would make the use ofthe International Accounting Standards (IAS),
1which are geared more to the concept of“fair value”, obligatory from 2005 for theconsolidated accounts of capital market-oriented firms
2(once the compatibility of
IAS with European accounting legislation hasbeen verified). In addition, the EU Commis-sion is envisaging the possibility of giving EUmember states the option of introducing thecompulsory or voluntary use of IAS for theconsolidated accounts of other firms (i.e.firms which are not publicly listed) and alsofor individual company accounts.
Under the IAS rules, as under the German
Commercial Code, capital is derived as a re-sidual after subtracting liabilities from totalassets. However, the assets and liabilities asshown in a set of annual accounts drawn upaccording to the Commercial Code may differsomewhat from the same accounts compiledin line with IAS – principally owing to meth-odological differences in distinguishing be-tween equity and debt items and to divergentdisclosure and valuation rules – which in turnleads to differences in the amount of equitycapital shown in the balance sheet (besidesvaluation at current or market or fair value,

The marking-to-market valuation method
used under IAS is currently applied especiallyto all financial instruments in the bankingbook and trading book apart from self-originated loans and refinancing liabilities inthe banking book, which have to be valuedat amortised cost.
Accounting for items at their “fair value” has
implications for the equity capital to beshown in the financial statements, as fluctu-ations in value are reflected in the net profitor loss for the period and/or equity. However,the option under IAS of disclosing such re-valuation amounts of financial instrumentsthat are available for sale either as a net gainor loss (i.e. in the income statement) or as aneutral event (i.e. under equity) must not re-sult in the identical economic situation of arevaluation reserve leading to different treat-ments as regards regulatory capital.

Given the traditional (and unquestioned) im-portance of preserving capital, it is importantthat market-related valuation changes haveno substantive impact on the level of equitycapital. This will continue to be ensured aslong as the payment and dividend distributionfunction is based on the parent company ac-counts rather than the group accounts andthe parent company accounts are not drawnup according to IAS. When calculating theregulatory liable capital, a similar solutionshould be applied to the treatment of liabilityitems included as the counterparts of marketprice-related write-ups (e.g. revaluation re-serves) or which result from unrealised gains.
This problem will arise already in connectionwith the 2001 financial year for consolidatedaccounts which, pursuant to section 292a ofthe Commercial Code, are drawn up accord-ing to IAS or US GAAP
4and which are used
as the basis for calculating regulatory capital.That is the case for internationally active insti-tutions which, in a voluntary agreement withthe Federal Banking Supervisory Office, havecommitted themselves to comply with theBasel Committee’s new capital recommenda-tions.
Capital requirements
The regulatory capital requirements are min-
imum requirements imposed on credit institu-tions by the banking supervisory authorities.By contrast, a bank’s economic capital re-quirements represent the equity capital whichthe credit institution itself deems necessary orwhich should be considered necessary in thelight of prudent risk management. Economicand regulatory capital requirements basicallycomprise three aspects:
– the definition of capital or own funds,– a measure of the exposure to risk, and
3It is likely that this option will be dropped and that such
revaluation amounts will then always be offset against
equity with no impact on the net profit or loss.
4Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) are
developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) in the USA and are binding on all firms that have
to draw up independently audited accounts in the United
States; some large companies in the EU and in Germany
also apply US GAAP , mainly prompted by the desire to be
listed in the US capital markets.Disclosure at

45– the relationship between capital and that
measure.
Economic and regulatory capital requirements
are normally not identical. For one thing, aswas pointed out in the section on capitalcomponents, the capital concept used intern-ally by banks tends to be narrower than theregulatory concept. For another, regulatoryand economic capital requirements differwith respect to the measurement of the risksthat are to be backed by capital. This con-cerns, for example, the choice of the relevantrisk factors. For example, so far the bankingregulators have not required institutions toback their operational risk with capital, eventhough most banks regard this as a significantrisk factor.
5Furthermore, there are also sub-
stantial differences when it comes to quanti-fying risks. For instance, some banks plan touse credit risk models in order to computetheir aggregate credit risk. But such modelsare not yet authorised for determining theregulatory capital requirement. A third pointis that the relationship between the riskmeasure and the required amount of capitalis not the same for the economic and regula-tory capital requirements. The level of capitalactually held is largely determined by theinstitution’s subjective risk propensity or therating it aspires to achieve. For this reasonthere is also no clear, objective level of eco-nomic capital. Many institutions actually holddistinctly more than the stipulated prudentialminimum of 8% (see table on page 46).
If the gap between the regulatory and eco-
nomic capital requirements is too wide, thismay lead to undesirable capital arbitrage byinstitutions. This means that banks favour
types of business which carry low regulatorycapital requirements compared with otherrisk-bearing operations or which reduce theiroverall capital requirements (e.g. securitisa-tions). Another danger is that credit risksmight be assumed by financial market playerswho are not subject to banking supervision.The goal of banking regulators and super-visors must therefore be to achieve a closeconvergence between regulatory and eco-nomic capital requirements without actingtoo prescriptively.
However, complete convergence between
regulatory and economic capital requirementsis impeded by the limitations arising from thedivergent goals of banking regulators andbanks in pursuing their commercial business.Owing to their binding nature, regulatorycapital requirements have to be
– objective and verifiable,– comparable for a wide array of credit insti-
tutions, and
– not too restrictive (regulatory capital re-
quirements are minimum requirements).
By contrast, economic capital requirements
are
– largely subjective, based on the risk as-
sessment made by the bank’s managers,

risk is more significant than market risk. However, reliable

Given the resulting constraints, the new ver-
sion of the capital rules which the Basel Com-mittee is currently developing (Basel II) seeksto achieve a convergence between regulatoryand economic capital requirements. The ob-jective, through adequate risk measurement,is to avoid misalignments in the financial sys-tem, to improve the supervisory authorities’assessment of the macroeconomic risk pos-ition and to safeguard the stability of thefinancial system.Computing economic capital
Quite apart from Basel II, growing competi-
tive pressures and declining profit marginsare likewise forcing many banks to allocatescarce capital to their individual business unitsmore efficiently and risk-sensitively than hith-erto. This necessitates above all a comprehen-sive evaluation of the classical banking risks(credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and op-erational risk) based on sophisticated financialmethods.
The real risk to banks comes from unexpected
losses, as the expected losses are usuallycovered by the contractual terms agreed withthe customer (e.g. through correspondingmargins in lending business). But capital buf-fers have to be created for unexpected lossesBanks’ balance sheet and regulatory capital ratios*

risk propensity. The expected loss is normallydefined via the expected value of the loss dis-tribution, while the unexpected loss is the dif-ference between the future (uncertain) lossand the expected loss. The unexpected loss iscustomarily quantified using the value at risk

or the standard deviation of the loss distri-bution.
Thanks not least to Basel II, credit risk is be-
coming the focus of banks’ risk managementstrategies. The following section is thereforeconfined to an outline of some state-of-the-art approaches to computing the eco-nomic capital requirement for backing creditrisk.
A key factor in computing economic capital is
the risk that the borrower will default. Themany different methods which banks use toforecast the default probabilities of their bor-rowers can be grouped into the followingthree categories:
– expert systems,– statistical models,– financial models.Historically, internal expert systems have been
the starting point of banks’ assessment oftheir borrowers’ creditworthiness. Expert sys-tems value the firm in question predominant-ly on the basis of accumulated knowledgeand experience. Among the main inputs arethe quality of the firm’s management, its cap-ital structure, its profit outlook, the volatilityof its earnings and the quality of its collateral.
At the end of the assessment process the firmis assigned a credit score. Default and migra-tion probabilities
7are derived from historical
default rates.
Statistical models determine the default risk
with the aid of complex econometricmethods, mainly using balance sheet andsectoral ratios as explanatory variables. Atleast four different approaches may be dis-tinguished: linear probability models, logitmodels, probit models and discriminant an-alyses. The most widely used system is dis-Loss 0Density

48criminant analysis. Essentially, this method
identifies the linear function in balance sheetratios and market variables that can mostclearly segregate firms into the categories of“default” and “non-default”. One perceiveddrawback of statistical models is that theychiefly rely on firms’ book values, which fre-quently fail to give a complete picture of thefirm’s real situation.
Financial models are based on quantitative
theories of firms’ default risk. Some of theestablished credit risk models regard a firm’sequity as a call option on its total assets. Thusthe firm becomes insolvent when the marketvalue of its assets falls below the value of itsdebt. According to the option pricing ap-proach, the probability that a firm will defaultdepends on the ratio of its liabilities to itsassets and on the volatility of its assets. Forpublicly listed enterprises, both parameterscan be inferred from the share price providedit represents an accurate indication of thefirm’s intrinsic value. For non-listed enter-prises, by contrast, proxy variables have to beused instead (e.g. EBITDA: earnings beforeinterest, taxes, depreciation and amortisa-tion). A different approach computes the de-fault probabilities from the yield spreads ofcorporate bonds. This is done by calculatingthe implied forward rates of risk-free andrisk-bearing bonds, from which the risk pre-mia to cover the likelihood of non-repayment can then be derived in relation tomaturity.
Based on the aggregate default probabilities
of its individual borrowers, a bank must thencalculate the economic capital requirementfor its loan portfolio as a whole. The tradition-
al approaches to managing credit risk at theportfolio level were often based on a subject-ive analysis of borrowers and of the generalrisk situation of a given sector or country to-gether with a system of limits which definedthe credit line for individual borrowers andsectors. At the same time, considerable ad-vances have been made in recent years in themeasurement of default risk and in the de-sign, calibration and implementation of creditrisk models. Since they are based on financialportfolio theories, they have the advantage –in contrast to the traditional practice of set-ting limits – of providing an objective frame-work for computing the economic capital re-quirement.
Some credit risk models are based on an actu-
arial approach which records only whether anobligor defaults (default mode) but not howhis creditworthiness changes over time. It isassumed that the default probabilities areknown. Under certain probabilistic assump-tions, a loss distribution is derived from whichthe required level of economic capital canthen be calculated (default mode models arediscussed in Annex 1 on pages 52 f.).
Other models, by contrast, are based on rat-
ing data. They model not only an obligor’s de-fault probability but also the possibility thathis creditworthiness may improve or deterior-ate. The loss distribution of the loan portfoliois usually computed by numerical simulation.The principal input is migration matrices,which map the probability that a borrowerwill migrate from one credit grade to another.

49Capital allocation and
bank-wide business management
Like any business undertaking, a bank seeks
to make a profit. To avoid misallocating its re-sources, it must consider the generated orprojected returns in relation to the expectedrisk. A number of banks now calculate ratiosfor risk-adjusted returns which are used asa decision-making basis for the institution’sstrategic orientation, for measuring the per-formance and managing the risk of the indi-vidual business units as well as for calculatingthe compensation of employees. Ratios suchas RORAC (return on risk-adjusted capital)and RAROC (risk-adjusted return on capital)have become standard market benchmarksused by advanced institutions and are increas-ingly replacing the traditional ratios such asROE (return on equity) or ROA (return onassets).
RORAC and RAROC are better gauges of
operational performance than the traditionalratios as they relate the return to the risk in-curred. On the other hand, rates of return saynothing about the absolute level of the ex-pected or generated profit. If RAROC is usedas the sole tool for measuring the commercialperformance of individual business units,there is therefore a danger that only the mostprofitable investments will be made. Yet busi-ness considerations mandate that every in-vestment is worthwhile as long as the mar-ginal return exceeds the marginal cost of therequired economic capital. Calculating theeconomic capital requirement for the bank asa whole is highly complex and varies fromone institution to another. Methods with dif-fering levels of sophistication are therefore
employed to allocate economic capital; themost advanced methods, in particular, takedue account of the diversification effects ofthe individual business units (see Annex 2,pages 53 ff.: Computing the bank-wide eco-nomic capital requirement).
Overview of the regulatory capital
requirements
The regulatory capital requirements are en-
shrined in the Banking Act and, in addition, inPrinciple I concerning the capital of institu-tions. The basis of these regulations is theBasel Capital Accord of 1988 (Basel I), whichhas been translated into German law throughthe national implementation of EU Directives.Principle I stipulates that at least 8% of theRisk-adjusted rates of return

The risk-adjusted return on capital additionally
takes account of the opportunity cost of carryingcapital:

In order to determine the risk-weighted ex-
posures, the risk assets (asset items and off-balance-sheet positions) are classified intorisk buckets subject to different prudentialweightings (0%, 10%, 20%, 50%, 70%,100%) pursuant to section 13 of Principle I.For example, claims on zone A central gov-ernments carry a zero weighting, claims oncredit institutions have a 20% weighting andclaims on enterprises (irrespective of theiractual credit standing) are weighted at a full100%. This regime of weighting exposuresirrespective of creditworthiness has led to amarked discrepancy between economic andregulatory capital requirements and hastherefore been criticised. There was a dan-ger that banks might tend to incur higherrisks since the capital charges are not risk-sensitive. This made it necessary to revise theBasel Accord.
Basel II aims to align the risk weightings with
the actual default risk. Moreover, for the firsttime the prudential capital requirements areto explicitly embrace not just credit and mar-ket risk but also operational risk. This resultsin the following prudential capital require-ments:

Basel II provides for a spectrum of approaches
to measuring credit risk with a view to givingbanks an incentive to progressively changeover to more advanced methods and thus to
align regulatory capital more closely with eco-nomic capital.
Under the standardised approach the credit
risk and the resulting capital charge are calcu-lated with the aid of external ratings. Differ-ent groups of borrowers (e.g. sovereigns,banks, corporates) are assigned standardisedrisk weightings depending on their credit-worthiness (0%, 20%, 50%, 100%, 150%,1,250%). Unrated claims are automaticallygiven a weighting of 100%.
In contrast to the rigid standardised ap-
proach, in which the risk weights are laiddown by the supervisory authorities, riskweights under the internal ratings-based (IRB)approach are computed on an exposure-specific basis subject to a regulatory risk-weight function. A bank’s exposures are div-ided into five classes (corporate, bank, sover-eign, retail and equity exposures). Banks canchoose between using the foundation ap-proach, under which they themselves maymerely assess the probability of default (PD)of their borrowers, and a more advanced ap-proach in which the bank itself is largely re-sponsible for assessing the other inputs, too(LGD, EaD, M).

51according to a set risk function laid down by
the regulators (see chart opposite).
There is only one approach for the retail cus-
tomer portfolio (which includes, for example,mortgage loans). The input parameters arePD and LGD; one of the parameters may bederived from the expected loss EL. As a gen-eral rule, exposures to retail borrowers willcarry a much lower capital charge.
Two parallel approaches to equity exposures
are being considered: the market-based ap-proach and the PD-LGD approach. For bothapproaches a simple method exists by whichset risk weights are laid down by regulators.Under the more advanced methods banksmay use their own estimates; under themarket-based approach internal models or ascenario approach may be applied.
A more risk-sensitive treatment of exposures
is additionally assured under Basel II bywidening the recognition of guarantees andcollateral. The range of eligible collateral andguarantees depends on which approach acredit institution opts to use. In the advancedapproach, which comes closest to the con-cept of economic capital, institutions maythemselves determine the range of their eli-gible collateral and the loss rates for collaterallosses.
Significance of credit risk modelsAs mentioned, credit institutions are increas-
ingly seeking to use credit risk models to cal-culate their economic capital requirements. Inprinciple, it is conceivable that such internalmodels could be granted prudential recogni-
tion, as is already the case for market risk.However, the use of credit risk models tocompute the regulatory capital requirementraises considerable problems which do notoccur, at least on the same scale, in the fieldof market risk. Therefore, it has hitherto beenrejected by the regulators. A key problem isvalidating the model being used. Unlike mar-ket risk models, there is still an insufficientpool of data for backtesting credit riskmodels. Particular problems are posed by themodelling of portfolio effects, the stability ofthe default correlations, the lack of marketdata on traditional lending business and theabsence of sufficient historical data on de-fault rates. The last-mentioned aspect islargely related to the long time horizon of

52one year that is customary in credit risk
models.
A certain convergence between regulatory
and economic capital requirements is never-theless achieved by Basel II in that the riskweights are derived from a simplified creditrisk model (see Annex 3, pages 55 ff.: Eco-nomic capital in a one-factor model). The key
assumptions are that firms’ returns are deter-mined by just one systematic risk factor andthat the loan portfolio is sufficiently granular.Under these (restrictive) assumptions, riskweights can be derived which are based onthe value-at-risk concept that is typically usedin credit risk models.
Annex 1
Economic capital in the default mode model
Default mode models basically capture borrower-
specific characteristics as well as systematic ormarket-wide factors in a statistical loss distributionof the loan portfolio. The loss distribution has thefollowing basic parameters:
– the exposure at default ( EaD),
– the borrowers’ probability of default ( PD),
– the loss given default ( LGD), and
– the correlation between the defaults of differ-
ent borrowers (
r).
The exposure at default is the sum of the current
exposure and the loan commitments taken upuntil the time of default. Most credit risk modelsassume a constant, i.e. non-stochastic, bankruptcyrate, with the most conservative assumption beinga rate of 0%. The loss given default is the counter-part to the bankruptcy rate, which is chiefly calcu-lated from the level and quality of the collateraland the bankruptcy costs incurred.If the loans remain in the banking book portfolio
throughout the contractually agreed period, thevalue of the loan claim when the contract expires– in relation to the present time – can be expressedas a binomially distributed random variable: with aprobability of (1- PD), the full loan amount will be
repaid; with a probability of PD,the bank will
receive only (1- LGD)·EaD. The loss ( L) on the
loan is likewise binomially distributed. It is custom-arily specified per unit of exposure at default. Theexpected loss on the loan is therefore expressed as:
EL = PD · LGD.The unexpected loss on the individual loan is usual-
ly expressed as the standard deviation of L:
UL = σKredit = LGD · √PD (1–PD)     
The loss on the overall loan portfolio equals the
sum of the weighted individual losses:
LPortfolio = ∑
iwi Li ,
where wi =EaD i
EaD k.∑k
The overall loss is likewise a random variable as it

53ual losses. However, the unexpected loss on the
portfolio as a whole is usually far smaller than thesum of the unexpected losses on the individualloans owing to diversification effects. Thus thestandard deviation for the portfolio loss is deter-mined not only by the standard deviation of the in-dividual losses but to a large extent also by correl-ations between the loans:
σPortfolio  =          w i wk σi σk ρik . Σ
iΣ
k
The risk contribution of an individual loan to a
portfolio is therefore smaller than its UL:
RBi=w isiri,
where ridenotes the correlation between the in-
dividual loss and the portfolio loss:
ρ i =     wk σk  ρ ik  /  σ Portfol io . Σ
k
The following holds for the risk contribution:
– The sum of the risk contributions equals the
standard deviation of the portfolio loss.
– The risk contribution increases as the ULrises
and as the weight of the individual loan in-creases.
– The smaller the correlation with the portfolio
loss, the smaller the risk contribution. (Theusual correlation is positive and, for a typicalloan portfolio, amounts to between 0.5% and3%).
TheULfor the overall loan portfolio is frequently
defined not by the standard deviation but by thevalue at risk (VaR). As a rule, however, the VaR ismuch harder to determine than the standard devi-ation and in many cases can be computed with
sufficient accuracy only via default simulations.
Annex 2
Computing the bank-wide economic capitalrequirement
Stand-alone approachUnder the stand-alone approach the individual
business units of a bank autonomously calculatetheir profit and the amount of capital required tocover their unexpected losses. In this approach thesum of the economic capital of all the businessunits determines the bank’s aggregate economiccapital requirement. The major disadvantage ofthis method is that it disregards diversification ef-fects between the business units. The stand-aloneapproach produces the correct capital requirementfor the bank as a whole only in the special casethat the returns of the individual business units areperfectly correlated. But if the correlation is lower(which is empirically likely), it produces an exces-sive capital requirement.
Proportional scaling methodSome banks seek to counter the shortcomings of
the stand-alone approach by resorting to the pro-portional scaling method, under which a businessunit’s capital requirement is scaled in line with thebank’s total capital as laid down by the central man-agement. If a business unit reports a capital require-ment of K

54where KBankdenotes the bank’s total capital. Yet
this method of capital allocation is also imperfectas it ultimately does not allocate capital accordingto the originator principle. A business unit whosereturns have a low correlation with those of thebank as a whole would be allocated too much cap-ital even under the proportional scaling method.
Internal beta methodThe internal beta method allocates capital to the in-
dividual units in line with their actual contributionto the bank’s aggregate risk; it expressly takes ac-count of correlations between the returns of theunits. Under this approach the bank’s aggregate riskis determined using the standard deviation of futurereturns. The marginal contribution of a given unit tothe bank’s aggregate risk is given by its “beta”:
Σ
kßi =A
σ2
Bankwk  cov ik  ,
where covikdenotes the correlation between the
returns of the units iandk, A denotes the bank’s
financial resources, wkis the share of unit kin the
financial resources and sBankis the bank’s aggre-
gate risk. The economic capital allocated to agiven unit is given by the equation
K
i=bi·wi·KBank.
The impact of diversification effects is clear under
this approach: the higher the correlation of the re-turns with those of the bank as a whole, the high-er the economic capital allocated to the businessunit. It should be noted that because
Σ
iß i w i = 1 
the sum of the economic capital of the individual
business units equals the economic capital for thebank as a whole stipulated by the central manage-
ment.
Theoretically, the internal beta method – as long as
certain assumptions hold – enables the bank to op-timise its profitability (see following section). Theimplementation difficulties associated with thishighly advanced approach are considerable, how-ever. A key requirement for being able to set thebetas objectively is the availability of a sufficientpool of data. As the betas largely determine theprovision with capital and hence the individualunits’ cost of capital, this method may be a sourceof considerable conflict.
9
The internal beta method from a theoreticalperspective
The internal beta approach has the advantage that
diversification effects are explicitly taken into ac-count in the allocation of economic capital to thebank’s individual business units. However, it mustbe demonstrated that this approach really doesmeet the aim of optimal risk diversification in thecontext of decentralised decision-making. Thisquestion is investigated below using a simplemodel.
Assuming the bank has an unlimited capacity to
procure capital, its profit maximisation problem,taking its risk costs into account, may be formu-lated as follows:
Σ
imax A · Ri (σi ) wi – rK
9Theoretically, the beta of a business unit may even be
negative, which would imply a negative cost of capital.
But this case is highly improbable as the units are subject
to common systematic (macroeconomic) risk factors.

55subject to the constraint that the economic capital
corresponds to the actual capital:

where the variables denote the following:

It is assumed that the expected return of a unit

optimum values are marked by an asterisk).
The crucial question is whether, in the context of
decentralised decision-making, the interests of theindividual business units can be harmonised withthose of the bank as a whole. In the model con-sidered here, this is possible if each business unit isallocated capital amounting to K

It can be shown that s*

misation problem; the optimum for the bank as awhole is therefore also achieved in the context ofdecentralised decision-making.
The above model is based on some simplifying as-
sumptions, especially that the bank is able to setthe betas and determine the optimal allocation ofthe resources. Normally, however, the central man-agement will be able to base its decisions only onhistorical data. Hence application of the internalbeta method presupposes that future returns willhave the same distribution as past returns.
Annex 3
Economic capital in a one-factor model
If the economic capital is computed with the aid of
a credit risk model, the capital charge to cover anindividual exposure depends not only on loan-spe-cific criteria (PD, LGD, EaD) but also on the charac-teristics of the overall portfolio (default correl-ations) of which the loan forms part. The economiccapital of a portfolio thus generally differs from thesum of the economic capital of the individualloans. By contrast, the regulatory capital (underboth Basel I and Basel II) is merely the weightedsum of the individual exposures and is thus port-folio-independent. However, it can be shown that,under certain assumptions, set risk weights can beharmonised with general VaR-based risk models.The two key conditions for this are:
– The obligors’ returns are determined by a sin-
gle systematic risk factor.

Deutsche

56– The portfolio is composed of a large number of
small loans – i.e. it is “infinitely granular”.
These assumptions are of course very restrictive
and can be considered good approximations for areal loan portfolio only in exceptional cases. For ex-ample, it is normally impossible to assume thatthere is just one systematic risk factor (such as gen-eral cyclical developments) because the cycles ofdifferent sectors are generally not congruent withone another. Moreover, the assumption of infinitegranularity is a mathematical limiting case whichonly imperfectly mirrors the features of a real loanportfolio. Putting aside these objections, VaR-based risk weights can be derived as describedbelow.
Most risk models based on a default-mode ap-
proach can be reduced to a simple basic formula.LetXdenote the systematic risk factor and let
PD
i(x) denote the default probability of the i-th
loan conditioned on a realisation xofX. It is as-
sumed that the future value of a firm idepends on
the systematic risk factor Xand also on the idiosyn-
cratic (i.e. diversifiable) risk eias expressed in the
following:10
Ri=xiei–wiX.
The parameters xiandwiare firm-specific weight-
ing factors which determine the influence of therisk factors on the default risk. It is assumed thatthe loan will default if the firm’s value falls below acertain level
gi. Conditioned on a realisation of the
systematic risk factor and assuming normal distri-bution of the idiosyncratic risk, the probability of aloan default is expressed as
PD
i(x) = Pr ( ei#(gi+xwi)/x i)=F((gi+xwi)/x i)where Fdenotes the distribution function of the
standard normal distribution. It should be notedthat the a priori unknown parameter
gican be in-
ferred from the unconditional default probability
PDiof the loan through gi=F-1(PDi) (given a nor-
mal distribution of Ri). IfAidenotes the amount of
the loan and the random variable Uithe random
loss ( LGD ifor a default, otherwise 0), the loss rate
of the overall portfolio is given by
Ln
  = Ui AiΣn
i=1
AiΣ i=1.n
Letaq(Y) denote the q-quantile of a random vari-
ableY. It remains to be demonstrated that the VaR
of the portfolio loss aq(Ln) for a sufficiently granu-
lar portfolio (large n, small Ai) depends solely on
the specific characteristics of the loans. The idio-syncratic risks do indeed cancel each other out atthe limit. The VaR of the portfolio loss thus con-verges towards E[L
n‰X=aq(X)]. This expression
is portfolio-invariant since the default probabilitiesconditioned on a realisation xare uncorrelated:
E[Ln | X = x ]  = LGDi  · PDi(x) · A Σn
i=1
AiΣn
i=1.
The above relationship suggests a simple capital rule:
let every loan ibe backed by LGD i·PDi(X=aq(X))
worth of capital per unit of money of the loan’s nom-inal value. If Xis normally distributed and if sis the uni-
form correlation of the firm’s value, the risk weightfunction of a loan with an LGDof 100% is given, de-
pending on the unconditional default probability, by
f(PD) = Φ [Φ–1(PD ) +1
√1 – s√s
√1 – sΦ–1(q)].
10Without loss of generality, it can be assumed that Ri,X
andeihave an expected value of 0 and a variance of 1.

*Long-run links among money, prices and
output: world-wide evidence
Discussion paper 14/01
by Helmut Herwartz andHans-Eggert Reimers
Many theoretical macroeconomic models are
underpinned by the belief that, in the longrun, inflation is a monetary phenomenon.Empirical tests of this thesis are overwhelm-ingly based on studies of national money-demand functions, supplemented by cross-sectional analyses in which the averagegrowth rates of monetary aggregates andprices, as well as those of real output andmonetary aggregates, are investigated for araft of countries. A comparison of the growthrates supports the initial hypothesis. In termsof their methodologies, though, such studieshave obvious shortcomings.
This research paper uses a P-star model to
analyse the relationship between monetaryaggregates, prices and output. This theoretic-al approach is based on the modern versionof the quantity theory and regards the currentinflation rate as being dependent on a “pricegap” which describes the relationship be-tween the current price level and an equilib-rium price level. The equilibrium price level isthe price level attained given normal capacityutilisation and the current supply of money. Anumber of theoretical restrictions may be de-rived from this theory, which are investigated

60using a panel cointegration approach. This
new approach combines a non-stationaritymethod for macroeconomic time series,which has become standard practice over thepast few years, with cross-sectional ap-proaches. In this paper, the error-correctionapproach for non-stationary time series is ap-plied to pooled data to yield more meaningfulresults. The chosen approach makes it pos-sible to test for cointegration and parameterrestrictions in the cointegration vector using asimulation approach (the “wild bootstrap ap-proach”).
It becomes apparent that, at the national
level, a cointegration relationship betweenmoney, output and prices is not found in allcases. Cointegration between these variables,however, can be confirmed for the pooledcountry analyses. Furthermore, the parameterrestrictions for the cointegration vector im-plied by the P-star model are tested consecu-tively. These individual restrictions must be re-jected if all countries are studied simultan-eously, regardless of whether the monetaryaggregate under investigation is broadly ornarrowly defined.
By contrast, if the restrictions implied by the
model are entered into the model wholesale,thus causing the inflation equation of theP-star model to be estimated as an error-correction model, it emerges that the coeffi-cients of the price gaps in the pool are, onthe whole, significantly different from zero. Inorder to refute the objection that the evi-dence is supported only by the parallel move-ment of monetary growth and inflation ratesin some high-inflation countries, the coun-tries in the pool are arranged according to
their average inflation rates. The greater thenumber of higher-inflation countries enteringthe pool, the stronger the rejection of the nullhypothesis will be, and the greater will be theimpact of the price gap on inflation.
On the whole, this study confirms the hy-
pothesis that monetary growth is a crucialelement in the long-term future developmentof prices. These findings thus support theview that a forward-looking stability-orientedmonetary policy has to take monetary devel-opments very seriously.
Currency portfolios and currency
exchange in a search economy
Discussion paper 15/01
by Ben Craig and Christopher J. Waller
In many developing and transitional econ-
omies, “safe” foreign currencies such as theUS dollar or the D-Mark (and probably alsothe euro in future) circulate as a medium ofexchange alongside the “risky” domestic cur-rency, which is subject to unexpected lossesof purchasing power. This phenomenon isoften called “dollarisation”. Furthermore,there is active domestic currency exchange.At first glance, the existence of these twotrading patterns may not appear to be un-usual, but it actually creates a puzzle: if bothcurrencies are accepted as media of ex-change, why are currencies exchanged? Evi-dently, agents are heterogeneous in some di-mension such that trading currencies im-proves the welfare of each individual agent.As a case in point, agents holding large

Deutsche
Bundesbank

61amounts of risky domestic currency may be
willing to give up multiple units of that cur-rency for a single unit of the safe foreign cur-rency.
In order to investigate more closely the ex-
change of currency, this discussion paperpresents a model of decentralised exchangewith two currencies circulating as media ofexchange. In addition, new aspects not exam-ined in previous studies have also been takeninto account, such as portfolio diversification,the endogenous determination of nominalexchange rates and the role of risk aversion inportfolio choice. In the model, dollarisation isthe natural outcome of optimising agents inthe face of risky domestic currencies.
Using this model, it is possible to study how
fundamental changes in the currency risk im-pact on the real exchange rate, the meannominal exchange rate, the cross-sectionalvariance of the nominal exchange rate distri-bution, the extent to which the dollar is usedin goods exchange (dollarisation) and the vol-ume of currency trading. However, due to thecomplexity of the model, the authors resortto numerical methods to study the equilib-rium behaviour of the economy and to ad-dress other issues.
If the domestic currency is subject to currency
risk, the value of the domestic currency as amedium of exchange falls. In other words,the risk is a kind of “tax” on the domesticcurrency. Furthermore, agents now have anincentive to diversify their portfolios by trad-ing multiple units of the risky currency for aunit of the safe currency if the opportunityarises. At an appropriate exchange rate, sell-
ers of the safe currency are compensated foraccepting the risky currency. The nominal ex-change rate observed in different matchesdepends on the relative portfolio positions ofthe currency traders who are paired together.Not surprisingly, therefore, increasing theriskiness of the domestic currency leads to adepreciation of the domestic currency relativeto the foreign currency (the mean of the dis-tribution shifts). More surprising is that theincrease in currency risk can increase or de-crease the variance of the nominal exchangerate distribution. Furthermore, by shuttingdown currency exchange, the authors wereable to demonstrate how the existence of acurrency market affects welfare in the econ-omy.
Rent indices for housing in West
Germany, 1985–1998
Discussion paper 01/02
by Johannes Hoffmann and Claudia Kurz
To a central bank, the correct measurement
of inflation is of major importance. This is es-pecially the case if, like the Deutsche Bundes-bank in the past and the European CentralBank in the present, the central bank is com-mitted to maintaining price stability. The cor-rect measurement is not a trivial task. In anumber of countries, studies have shown thatmeasurement errors can occur. An earlierstudy also confirmed this for Germany.

62did not consider expenditure on housing. The
new discussion paper studies the develop-ment of housing rents for potential distor-tions.
German price statistics record rents for three
types of apartments in the privately financedsegment and for three types of apartments inthe subsidised segment of the market. Theapartments in question have three or fourrooms. Smaller apartments and bigger dwell-ings, such as single-family houses, are nottaken into account. This raises the questionof whether the official figures for rent in-creases are representative of the entire uni-verse of dwellings.
To begin with, “hedonic functions”, which
explain rents in terms of the dwellings’ char-acteristics, are estimated on the basis of theSocio-Economic Panel (SOEP) – a regular sur-vey of a representative panel of householdsabout their living conditions. The results ofthese cross-section regressions are then usedto calculate quality-adjusted rent indices,which are subsequently compared with theofficial index of the Federal Statistical Office.During the observation period of 1985 to
1998, the rent index derived from the SOEPshows an annual average rise which is around1 percentage point faster than the officialindex. This indicates that the official con-sumer price index is likely to have understatedrather than overstated rental price inflation,unlike in the case of some industrial goodswhich were examined in the earlier study.
The deviations from the official rental price
index are concentrated on the 1991–1994period. In the years before and after that, themulti-year average of rental price inflation,according to hedonic estimates, matches thatmeasured by the official index.
The reason for that finding is not the relative-
ly narrow definition of dwellings in the officialindex; rather, calculating an index in accord-ance with the official definition using theSOEP largely confirms the revealed differ-ences. There are no clear indications that thedifferences are due to differing quality adjust-ment methods, either.

*These euro area retail bank interest rates should be used with caution and Member States. Furthermore, the national interest rates are not harmonised
for statistical purposes only, primarily to analyse their development over in terms of their coverage (new business and/or outstanding amounts), th e
time rather than their level. They are calculated as the weighted average of nature of the data (nominal or effective) or the compilation method. The
national interest rates provided by the national central banks. The national country weights for the euro area retail bank interest rates are derived from
rates represent those rates that are currently available from national MFI balance sheet statistics or close proxies. The weights reflect thesources and which are judged to fit the standard categories. These national country-specific proportions of the relevant instruments within the eur o
rates have been aggregated to derive information for the euro area, in area, measured as outstanding amounts. The weights are adjusted monthly,some cases relying on proxies and working assumptions due to the so that interest rates and weights always refer to the same month. —1En-
