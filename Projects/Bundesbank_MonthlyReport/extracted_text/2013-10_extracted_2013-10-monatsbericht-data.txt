Economic conditions
Underlying trends
German economic output is likely to have con -
tinued its rise in the third quarter, albeit not at 
the same level of the second quarter, which 
had been elevated by backlog and catch- up ef -
fects. Particularly construction, but also the in -
dustrial sector, recorded a more muted pace of 
growth. By contrast, industrial new orders and 
construction orders, as well as the Ifo measure 
of expectations for the coming period span -
ning the fourth quarter of 2013 and first quar -
ter of 2014, all indicate an acceleration of the 
cyclical trend. The fact that the framework con -
ditions for private consumption remain favour -
able is another indicator – the propensity to 
purchase is exceptionally high. In addition, 
households’ purchasing power is continuing to 
rise in terms of its underlying trend. The stag -
nation of growth in real wages in the second 
quarter should be regarded as temporary. Sal -
ary increases in key newly negotiated wage 
agreements were delayed, no new agreement 
has been reached in retail trade and bonus pay -
ments were generally smaller than a year earl -
ier. The continued increase in employment, 
with unemployment tending slightly upwards, 
should be seen in connection with the con -
tinued robust immigration, which offsets la -
bour market tightness. Corporate investment 
has thus far shown no signs of a marked re -
vival.
Industry
In August, industrial output rose by a season -
ally adjusted 2% month- on- month, thus more 
than offsetting July’s steep drop. Holiday ef -
fects are the probable cause of the pronounced 
monthly fluctuations, which were concentrated 
on the manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers 
and semi- trailers. On an average of July and August, industrial output was up by almost 
¼% from the second- quarter level. The pro -
duction of capital goods was up by ¾%, 
whereas that of intermediate goods was down 
by ½%. Consumer goods production remained 
largely unchanged.
Seasonally adjusted industrial sales on an aver -
age of the months of July and August were 
down somewhat from the previous quarter 
(-¼%). Domestic sales were up by 1%, whereas 
foreign sales fell by 1½%. Sales to non- euro-  
area countries were down particularly sharply, 
by 2½%; however, significantly more products 
had been delivered there in the preceding 
quarter. Sales to the euro area perpetuated 
their trend towards stabilisation, rising slightly 
by ½%.
Taking the two- month average of July and Au -
gust, the value of exported goods was slightly 
down from the average of the second quarter, 
at -¼%. By contrast, imports were continuing 
to tend upwards, though their growth weak -
ened to ¼%.
In August, too, new orders remained distinctly 
below their June level, which had been ele -
vated owing to numerous large orders; how -
ever, as in July already, they were still clearly 
higher than in April and May. On an average of 
July and August, they therefore exceeded their 
second- quarter average by ¾%. New orders 
for intermediate goods and capital goods each 
rose by 1%. Domestic orders, which had been 
hitherto weak, rose by a substantial 2¾%. 
Orders from non- euro- area countries, the 
underlying trend of which is quite dynamic, 
rose by a paltry ¼%. The particularly consider -
able influence of large orders on orders re -
ceived from euro- area countries made itself felt 
in the second quarter; in the reporting period, 
they were 2¾% down on their second- quarter 
average.Moderate eco-

Construction
Construction output held steady at a very high 
level in August despite a slight decline of 1%; 
this is reflected in the fact that construction 
equipment utilisation is far above average. Al -
though a marked decline in output was re -
ported for the construction industry as a whole, 
this is mainly attributable to reports on the fin -
ishing trades, which should be regarded as ex -
tremely provisional owing to their high suscep -
tibility to revision. On an average of July and 
August, overall construction output was up by 
2% from the second quarter. The increase was 
+1½% in the main construction industry and 
3% in finishing trades.
New orders in the main construction sector in 
July (more recent data are not yet available) 
were up by 3¼% on the month. The quarter-  
on- quarter increase was as much as 6%. This 
was due above all to the steep 10¾% rise in 
new orders in civil engineering. Building con -
struction improved by a mere 1¾%.
Labour market
Employment continues to rise. According to an 
initial estimate by the Federal Statistical Office, 
the seasonally adjusted number of employed 
persons in Germany rose in August by only 
13,000, and thus less strongly than on average 
over the past few months. Employment in jobs 
subject to social security contributions, how -
ever, rose very sharply in seasonally adjusted 
terms, by 47,000 persons, especially in business- 
related services and in the healthcare and social 
work sector (+9,000 each). Employment was 
up by 219,000 people, or 0.5%, from the pre -
vious year; employment subject to social secur -
ity contributions was up by 356,000 people, or 
1.2%. According to the Ifo Institute, enter -
prises’ willingness to recruit new staff in Sep -
tember maintained its rather high level of Au -
gust.Construction

The number of persons registered as un -
employed rose in September by 25,000 after 
seasonal adjustment, with the unemployment 
rate going up from 6.8% to 6.9%. Unemploy -
ment was up by 61,000 persons on the year. 
The more broadly defined category of under -
employment remained unchanged amidst the 
continuing scaling- back of labour market policy 
measures.
Prices
After rising sharply in August, the price per bar -
rel of Brent crude oil tended to decline over the 
course of September; at the end of the month, 
it had nearly returned to its July level in US$. 
The average price in September was up by ¾% 
from the previous month. Over the course of 
October so far, the oil price has risen slightly. As 
this report went to press, the price per barrel 
stood at US$109½%. The discount on crude oil 
futures was US$2¾ for deliveries six months 
ahead and US$5¾ for deliveries 12 months 
ahead.
In August, import prices rose once again by a 
seasonally adjusted 0.2% on the month only 
owing to the higher cost of energy products. 
Import prices and domestic producer prices 
(both excluding energy) remained unchanged 
on the month. Import prices were down 3.4% 
year- on- year following a decline of 2.6% in 
July, whereas producer prices fell by 0.5% on 
the year after remaining unchanged a month 
earlier. Beginning with the August reporting 
month, both import prices and commercial 
producer prices were re- based to 2010.
Consumer prices in September increased only 
minimally, by a seasonally adjusted 0.1% on the 
month. Food prices remained high, whereas 
the prices of industrial goods and energy rose 
somewhat again. Services prices and rents con -
tinued their moderate upward trend. Annual 
Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation fell from 
1.5% to 1.4%. Inflation according to the Har -
monised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) re -mained unchanged at 1.6%, although 0.3 per -
centage point of this figure was attributable to 
chain-  linking problems in accommodation ser -
vices.1
Public finances2
Local government finances
According to the latest cash statistics, local 
government fiscal balances (core budgets and 
off- budget entities) continued to improve in 
the second quarter of 2013. The surplus almost 
doubled year- on- year to €3½ billion. As in the 
previous quarter, revenue rose by 6% (or €3 bil -
lion). This high growth was driven in particular 
by revenue from current transfers by state gov -
ernment (+10½%, or €1½ billion), including 
general grants and funds passed on from cen -
tral government. However, the pace of the in -
crease in tax revenue slowed somewhat (+4%, 
or €½ billion; compared with +7½% in the first 
quarter) and local business tax receipts (after 
deduction of the revenue shares accruing to 
other government levels) stagnated. At 3% (or 
€1½ billion), the rise in expenditure lagged be -
hind revenue growth. Personnel costs (+2½%) 
and other operating expenditure (+1½%) in -
creased at a slower pace than spending on so -
cial benefits (+4½%), although growth in this 
item tailed off. After a weak phase at the be -
ginning of the year, fixed asset formation in -
creased again (+3%).
Local government thus posted a deficit of €1 
billion for the first half of 2013, which was €2 
billion down on the year. With a further sub -Marked rise in

2 In the short report on public finances, which regularly 
appears in the Monthly Report, the emphasis is on recent 
outturns. The quarterly editions of the Monthly Report 
(published in February, May, August and November), by 
contrast, contain a detailed description of general govern -
ment budget trends during the preceding quarter. For de -
tailed statistical data on budgetary developments and pub -
lic debt, see the statistical section of this report.Deutsche Bundesbank

stantial rise in revenue, not least due to higher 
transfers from state government (general 
grants as well as the relief provided by central 
government’s increased contribution to the 
basic allowance for the elderly, which is trans -
ferred to local government via state govern -
ment), this positive development is likely to 
continue until the end of the year. By contrast, 
despite further increases – not least in spend -
ing on personnel and social benefits – expend -
iture is expected to rise at a much slower pace 
than revenue overall. For the year as a whole, 
the surplus will thus probably be significantly 
above the figure of €1 billion recorded one 
year previously.
The fiscal surplus in the second quarter is re -
flected, at least in part, in the debt level of local 
government core budgets and off- budget en -
tities (including debt to general government). 
By the end of June, this was down just over 
€1½ billion on the end of March to €137½ bil -
lion. In addition to a further decline in credit market debt (-€½ billion), cash advances also 
fell significantly (-€1 billion) to €48½ billion. 
This indicates that local government debt relief 
programmes in individual federal states with 
high outstanding cash advances ( per capita ), in 
particular, have evidently come to bear. The 
federal state of Hesse alone recorded a sharp 
drop of almost €1 billion, probably as a result 
of such a programme.3 By contrast, the high 
level of outstanding cash advances in North 
Rhine-  Westphalia remained almost unchanged, 
and in Rhineland- Palatinate the figure even in -
creased further (as it did in Saxony-  Anhalt, 
which is, however, not as highly indebted). 
Overall, there has so far been no indication of 
any basic convergence between the local gov -
ernment budgetary situations in the individual 
federal states. The ultimate success of the debt 
relief programmes will hinge on compliance 
with the requirements regarding balanced 
budgets – which need to go hand in hand with 
the debt relief programmes – by implementing 
sustainable consolidation measures. Careful 
monitoring appears to be essential in this con -
text.
Securities markets
Bond market
In August 2013, the issue volume on the Ger -
man bond market stood at €118.9 billion in 
gross terms, down on the previous month’s fig -
ure (€143.3 billion). After deducting redemp -
tions, which also decreased considerably, and 
taking account of changes in issuers’ holdings 
of their own bonds, the volume of outstanding 
domestic bonds fell by €6.5 billion, compared 
with a drop of €28.3 billion in July. Foreign 
debt securities worth €6.9 billion were placed

3 In Hesse, assistance entitlements granted by the state 
government to local governments over a period of many 
years are to be sold to a state government bank and the 
funds used to reduce the debt level. While this will cause 
local government’s debt level to fall, but state govern -
ment’s to rise, these transactions are evidently not reflected 
in the revenue and expenditure figures reported in the cash 
statistics.Deutsche Bundesbank

on the German bond market, the majority of 
which were euro- denominated debt securities. 
On balance, the outstanding volume of bonds 
in Germany thus rose by €0.5 billion.
In the month under review, the public sector 
raised €6.4 billion on the capital market. This 
was largely attributable to central government 
(€5.1 billion), which, on balance, issued mainly 
two- year Schätze (€5.2 billion) and five- year 
Bobls (€2.8 billion). It principally redeemed 
10-year bonds and Treasury discount paper 
(Bubills) on balance, totalling €2.0 billion and 
€1.0 billion respectively. In the month under re -
view, the state governments tapped the capital 
market for €1.3 billion net.
In August, domestic enterprises issued bonds 
totalling €0.1 billion, compared with net re -
demptions of €2.6 billion in July. On balance, 
they only issued paper with a maturity of less 
than one year.
German credit institutions reduced their capital 
market debt by €13.0 billion in the month 
under review, redeeming primarily other bank 
debt securities which can be structured flexibly 
(€8.1 billion net) but also, to a lesser extent, 
mortgage Pfandbriefe (€2.6 billion) and public 
Pfandbriefe (€1.6 billion).
Non- resident investors were the main net 
buyers on the German bond market in August, 
adding debt securities with a total value of 
€2.5 billion to their portfolios. Domestic credit 
institutions likewise purchased bonds, amount -
ing to €1.4 billion net, whereas German non-  
banks and the Bundesbank sold debt securities 
with a net value of €2.0 billion and €1.6 billion 
respectively.
Equity market
In the month under review, domestic enter -
prises, most of which were listed companies, 
issued €0.2 billion worth of new shares on the 
German equity market. The volume of foreign shares on the German market increased by 
€0.7 billion at the same time. The vast majority 
of equities were purchased by non- resident in -
vestors (€1.2 billion). Domestic non- banks like -
wise added shares worth €0.6 billion to their 
portfolios. At the same time, domestic credit 
institutions sold shares in the amount of €0.9 
billion net.
Mutual funds
German mutual funds recorded a net inflow of 
€1.8 billion in August (July: inflow of €12.8 bil -
lion). The sole beneficiaries were specialised 
funds reserved for institutional investors, while 
retail funds saw a small outflow of €1.1 billion. 
Among the asset classes, mixed securities-  
based funds were the main issuers of new 
shares (€1.5 billion), but mixed funds also 
placed shares on the market (0.4 billion). Dur -

shares to the tune of €1.7 billion. German non- 
banks were the sole net buyers of mutual fund 
shares (€4.8 billion). By contrast, domestic 
credit institutions and non- resident investors 
sold mutual fund shares for €1.2 billion and 
€0.1 billion respectively.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur -
plus – in unadjusted terms – of €9.4 billion in 
August 2013. The result was €4.9 billion below 
the level of the previous month. This reflected a 
narrower trade surplus and the fact that invis -
ible current transactions, which comprise ser -
vices, income and current transfers, reverted to 
a deficit.
According to provisional figures released by the 
Federal Statistical Office, the foreign trade sur -
plus in August went down by €3.2 billion on 
the month to €13.1 billion. The marked decline 
was, however, due to seasonal variations as the 
surplus rose by €0.6 billion to €15.6 billion after 
seasonal and calendar adjustment. The increase 
in the value of exports, at 1.0%, was some -
what stronger than the 0.4% rise in the value 
of imports. Taking July and August together, 
seasonally adjusted nominal exports were mar -
ginally lower than the average of the second 
quarter of 2013, while imports were somewhat 
higher.
Invisible current transactions posted a deficit of 
€1.1 billion in August, compared with a surplus 
of €0.5 billion in July. This deterioration was 
mainly due to the fact that the services account 
deficit climbed by €1.7 billion to €3.8 billion. 
This was largely the result of the higher travel 
expenditure which is typical for this time of 
year. In addition, the deficit for current trans -
fers rose slightly from €3.5 billion to €3.6 bil -
lion in the reporting month. By contrast, net 
cross- border income grew by €0.2 billion to 
€6.3 billion.Current account

In August, German cross- border portfolio in -
vestment again resulted in net capital exports. 
However, at €5.5 billion, these were consider -
ably lower than in the previous month (€34.5 
billion). On the one hand, this sharp decline is 
attributable to the fact that German investment 
abroad in August, at €9.1 billion, was down on 
the month. On the other hand, the reversal in 
non- residents’ investment in Germany also 
contributed to this result, however. The period 
under review saw inflows to the tune of €3.7 
billion, contrasting with the large- scale out -
flows of funds in the previous months. The es -
calation of the crisis in Syria in August appears 
to have driven up the volume of safe haven 
flows. The buying interest of foreign investors 
was focused on secure forms of investment 
such as longer- dated government paper (€12.4 
billion). By contrast, they offloaded private 
bonds and money market paper of domestic 
issuers on balance. German investors predom -
inantly purchased foreign debt securities (€6.9 
billion), in particular bonds and notes. Further -
more, a small quantity of shares and mutual 
fund shares was also in demand.
Direct investment activity generated net capital 
exports of €6.7 billion in August after recording inflows of €3.3 billion in July. This turnaround 
was driven primarily by German enterprises al -
locating funds to their foreign subsidiaries 
(€8.6 billion), mainly by means of reinvested 
earnings and intra- group loans. By the same 
token, foreign proprietors also allocated funds 
to their German subsidiaries, albeit to a lesser 
extent (€1.9 billion).
In other statistically recorded investment, com -
prising financial and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank de -
posits and other assets, Germany saw net cap -
ital outflows of €14.9 billion in August. Govern -
ment bodies contributed €7.0 billion to this 
figure, predominantly by redeeming short- term 
foreign liabilities. By contrast, enterprises and 
households generated €3.9 billion. The bank -
ing system saw outflows of €11.7 billion, largely 
in response to all other balance of payment 
transactions. While credit institutions’ net ex -
ternal assets rose by €12.6 billion in August, 
the net external position of the Bundesbank fell 
slightly (€0.8 billion).
The Bundesbank’s reserve assets increased – at 
transaction values – by €0.4 billion in August.Net capital

The determinants and regional dependencies 
of house price increases since 2010
Residential property prices in Germany have been rising significantly since 2010, driven mainly by 
an increase in housing demand that has been greater than would be expected during an eco -
nomic upswing. This turnaround on the housing market has been due, in part, to sound economic 
growth and sustained improvements on the labour market in recent years, which have given rise 
to renewed confidence in the performance of the German economy. The impact of the financial 
and sovereign debt crisis should not be underestimated either. The extremely low interest rates for 
mortgage loans are likely to belong in this context. Real estate investments are also appearing in 
a different light owing to the very low returns on alternative investments and the heightened 
uncertainty in the financial markets. This has bolstered demand for apartments in particular.
So far, price increases have been concentrated on property markets in urban areas. Measured by 
the longer- term demographic and economic determinants, property in these areas is currently 
likely to be overvalued by between 5% and 10%. In the attractive large German cities, the upward 
deviations are, in some cases, as high as 20%, which is especially true of apartments. By contrast, 
the prices of single- family houses in both urban and rural areas do not appear to differ percep -
tibly from their fundamental level.
There are indications that the price rises are spreading from towns and cities to their surrounding 
areas. These spatial effects are, in part, due to determinants that have an impact going beyond 
regional borders. Given that there is also evidence of purely price- based transmission channels, it 
cannot be ruled out that overly optimistic expectations or speculation motives are fostering the 
regional dispersion of price impulses. Moreover, it is unlikely that the price pressure on the hous -
ing markets will ease in the short term. Despite the robust growth in housing construction, the 
expansion in the housing supply is still not sufficient to meet the additional demand for housing. 
Incentives to invest have to be in line with the market mechanism.
At present, no substantial macroeconomic risks are arising from the price structure on the hous -
ing market. The observed price movements reflect the lagged expansion of the housing supply. 
Possible price corrections could give rise to perceptible wealth losses for households, but growth 
in mortgage loans is still sluggish on the whole.
Finally, it should be noted that the results presented here are subject to considerable estimation 
uncertainty. First, available data for property markets still contain gaps, despite substantial 
improvements made over the past few years. Second, there is uncertainty regarding the price 
effect of key determinants. At the current end, this is mainly affecting interest rates.Deutsche Bundesbank

Pick- up in demand in the 
German housing market
The year 2010 saw a trend reversal in the Ger -
man housing market, which was reflected in a 
sharp rise in prices, a greater number of trans -
actions and buoyant construction activity. The 
trend reversal came at a time when the overall 
economic recovery was beginning to gain trac -
tion following the severe recession in the fourth 
quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, 
and optimistic economic and income expect -
ations were again prevailing throughout large 
parts of the country. Besides the cyclical mo -
mentum, there were structural factors, which either bolstered or, at least, no longer hindered 
an upturn in the housing market. The arduous 
adjustment process, for instance, which cor -
rected the exaggerations in housing construc -
tion following German reunification, was com -
pleted by the second half of the last decade, if 
not earlier.1 In addition, the side-effects of the 
structural reforms were no longer placing a 
strain on household incomes. Rather, the sus -
tained success in the labour market brought 
about by wage moderation and structural re -
forms have led to renewed confidence in the 
performance of the German economy.
Moreover, influences which are either directly 
or indirectly connected with the global financial 
crisis and the subsequent sovereign debt crisis 
in the euro area should also be borne in mind. 
Thus, the German property market, which had 
been calm for many years, suddenly became 
attractive for international investors after the 
bursting of the property market price bubbles 
in the US and a number of European housing 
markets. Furthermore, the incentives to invest 
in real estate also increased as the returns on 
financial assets decreased in relative terms, es -
pecially as investment decisions in an environ -
ment shaped by the crisis were characterised to 
a greater extent by a quest for safer assets. The 
belief that the value of assets can be best se -
cured by property ownership was, for many 
households, certainly an argument for con -
sidering the acquisition of property. The excep -
tionally favourable financing conditions are 
likely to have played a key role, even though 
the interest rates for mortgage loans have risen 
again slightly in recent months from their his -
toric low.
According to data provided by BulwienGesa 
AG, prices for houses and apartments have 
risen by a total of 8¼% over the past three 
years, or by an average of 2¾% per year. Al -

of stagnation spanning a decade and a half 
and has been exceptionally moderate to date 
compared with growth observed during boom 
periods in other countries, it has been attract -
ing a great deal of attention. This is likely to be 
due mainly to the marked difference in the dy -
namics of property prices between urban and 
rural areas. However, the finding that the price 
of apartments on an average of seven major 
German cities2 has risen in total by more than 
one- quarter since 2010, is giving rise to fears of 
a broad- based property price boom if the price 
impulses that are currently having an impact at 
the local level should spread across the entire 
country.
Price movements in the 
housing markets in light of 
demographic and economic 
determinants
The observed price movements do not, on their 
own, make it possible to derive any potential 
overvaluation or undervaluation. A benchmark 
would be required, but it cannot be specified 
unambiguously from a conceptual point of 
view, nor can it be observed directly. In prac -
tice, commonly used indicators, such as the re -
lationship between prices and rents or between 
prices and household incomes, often do not 
provide a uniform assessment. Furthermore, 
these indicators do not allow an overall assess -
ment, but throw light from different angles on 
whether the actual property price develop -
ments are justified by the fundamentals. In the 
case of assessment indicators based on econo -
metric methods the associated estimation un -
certainty has to be taken into consideration.
One problem is that, up until just a few years 
ago, the statistical recording of price develop -
ments in the German housing markets was 
flawed by a number of shortcomings, such as 
low observation frequency, limited representa -
tiveness and incomplete quality adjustment. 
Price data going far back into the past contain 
statistical breaks and, owing to a lack of re -gional coverage, are representative of the Ger -
man housing market as a whole only to a 
limited extent. This impairs the interpretation of 
the standard indicators, which, in a macroeco -
nomic context, are usually evaluated in relation 
to their long- term averages. Studies based on 
time- homogenous data, which can be carried 
out for short periods of time, are incomplete as 
they do not, or only inadequately take account 
of medium and long- term trends which are of 
major importance for property markets.
The theoretical basis of the price- to- rent ratio is 
the present value model of asset prices. In this 
model, the purchase price of a property is cal -
culated from the discounted expected (net) 
rent payments. Assuming that the discount rate 
is constant, housing prices and rents should 
follow the same trend over the long term and 
the ratio of the two variables should fluctuate 
around a constant average value over time. 
Under these circumstances, the purchase of a 
property is considered as an investment deci -
sion for which the no- arbitrage condition be -
tween buying and renting is decisive. However, 
given the many different motives that people 
have for buying property, this reasoning ap -
pears somewhat short- sighted. Furthermore, 
the assessment of profitability will depend on 
whether new or existing rents are being con -
sidered and which required interest rate is 
being used. There is much to suggest that re -
turn expectations on real estate investments 
may have fallen in light of the financial market 
setting in recent years.
That residential property prices as a whole have 
continued to develop largely in line with the 
prices of new lettings in recent years is, on the 
whole, a plausible assessment. Nevertheless, 
deriving a concrete longer- term yardstick for 
this relationship in order to assess current de -
velopments presents considerable problems.

be compared dating back to 1975. In the 
period prior to German reunification, the data 
only comprise information for 50 west German 
towns and cities. After reunification, survey 
data included 125 towns and cities, 99 of 
which are in west Germany. Data for the coun -
try as a whole have only been available since 
2004. The striking differences between urban 
and rural areas and the western and the east -
ern parts of the country raise doubts as to 
whether the heterogeneous data series can be 
linked together in order to calculate long- term 
averages. Interpretation difficulties also occur 
when comparing the price- to- rent ratio for 
Germany as a whole at the current end with 
the average calculated solely on the basis of 
selected data for west Germany.
Prices and rents play a role in establishing an 
equilibrium in the property and rental markets. 
Owing to the numerous different interactions 
between these market segments, both vari -
ables are generally influenced by exogenous shocks, macroeconomic trends, interest rate 
movements, expectation effects and economic 
policy measures. Overly optimistic expectations 
give rise to upward pressure, especially on 
prices. If, however, rents rise substantially 
against this backdrop as well, the price- to- rent 
ratio may remain largely unchanged. Con -
versely, the price- to- income ratio would shoot 
upwards. This variable can therefore be used to 
ascertain whether property prices are develop -
ing in line with households’ current economic 
situation. From a theoretical perspective, this is 
based on a simple test to assess the financial 
sustainability of home financing. Attempting to 
interpret the price- to- income ratio relative to its 
long- term average is complicated by the fact 
that this variable has – cyclical fluctuations 
aside – been trending downwards since the 
mid-1970s. It is fair to assume that the statis -
tical weaknesses, especially in earlier years, 
meant that the property price index used – the 
only index available for this period – did not Household

fully capture the long- term price trends in the 
housing market.3
Property price statistics have enjoyed better 
coverage over the past ten years. The price 
index for owner-  occupied housing, which is 
published by the Association of German Pfand -
brief Banks ( Verband deutscher Pfandbriefban -
ken or vdp), provides a quarterly indicator for 
the period from 2003 onwards, which is char -
acterised by a broad coverage, high represen -
tativeness and sound quality adjustment. This 
data source shows that property prices have 
developed in line with the disposable income 
of an average household. If the interest rate 
conditions for new mortgage loans, which 
have also been recorded since 2003, are taken 
into account when conducting a comprehen -
sive assessment of affordability, a substantial 
improvement can be observed since the out -
break of the financial crisis. Assuming that the 
downpayment share is constant, the annuity of 
a mortgage loan with a ten- year fixed interest 
rate and a hypothetical term of 30 years places 
one- quarter less of a strain on household in -
come at present than in the summer of 2008, 
even though the need for external financing 
has increased significantly owing to the rise in 
purchase prices.
This, however, is a special situation. It is highly 
unlikely that the interest rates for mortgage 
loans will remain at the current level through -
out – what is typically – a very long repayment 
period. Furthermore, extrapolating a historically 
favourable interest rate environment for prop -
erty purchases is not an appropriate way of ad -
equately portraying the risks stemming from a 
sharp rise in property prices. This is clearly dem -
onstrated by developments in the euro-  area 
member states in recent years. If the assess -
ment of affordability is therefore focused more 
on an interest rate level adjusted for cyclical 
fluctuations and special factors, the situation 
does not appear to be quite so favourable. 
Overall, however, purchasing property in Ger -
many – measured in terms of the strain exerted 
by the long- term debt service burden on cur -rent income – does not appear to have become 
more expensive of late than throughout long 
stretches of the past decade.
Comparatively simple indicators, such as the 
price- to- rent ratio or the price- to- income ratio 
often mask numerous factors that have an im -
pact on the housing markets. Econometric ap -
proaches can be used as a way of modelling 
these factors more explicitly. These allow a 
more comprehensive analysis of the extent to 
which current price developments have de -
parted from the historic fundamentals. Finally, 
regional developments can also be considered 
more specifically in this context. The main de -
terminants of the demand for property include 
current household income and the financing 
conditions. Given that buying an apartment or 
a house is a decision that households make as 
a medium to long- term commitment, expect -
ation variables also play a major role. Forward- 
looking effects can be modelled based on the 
growth or income expectations derived from 
surveys. In addition, demographic variables (eg 
number of inhabitants and households, age 
structure of the population) and macroeco -
nomic indicators (eg unemployment rate) 
should also be considered as demand- side de -
terminants in the housing market. The supply 
factors are generally reflected in residential 
construction, with availability and prices of 
building land and construction costs playing an 
important role. On balance, a stock- flow equi -
librium model can be specified for the housing 
market in which a large part of the short- term 
balancing of supply and demand occurs via the 
property price.
In the empirical implementation, an equation is 
usually estimated for the equilibrium property 
price using econometric procedures. In order

An approach to estimating fundamental house prices 
based on regional data
The theoretical framework for the econo-
metric estimations is a stock- fl  ow model for 
the real estate market.1 In this model, the 
current stock of housing is taken as the 
housing supply.2 Housing demand typically 
refl  ects households’ economic situation and 
prospects as well as fi  nancial parameters 
and demographic conditions.
Real rents – whether measured directly on 
the rental housing market or inferred in the 
case of owner- occupied homes  – bring 
about a periodical balancing of supply and 
demand on this market. Using the simple 
present- value asset pricing model, it is fur-
ther assumed that the price of residential 
property is equal to the sum of discounted 
expected future rent payments. Accord-
ingly, the price- to- rent ratio depends posi-
tively on expected future rent increases and 
negatively on real interest rates. A funda-
mental (partial) equilibrium on the real es-
tate market additionally requires that the 
ratio of rent payments to income should re-
main more or less constant.
Replacing equilibrium rent payments by the 
house price, taking account of long- term 
growth expectations and real interest rates, 
yields a fundamental equilibrium house 
price. For a given level of demand, a larger 
housing stock and higher real interest rates 
will dampen prices, while higher demand due to changes in current or expected fu-ture socioeconomic factors will tend to 
drive up residential property prices.
The theoretical model framework can be 
used to derive an equation for determining 
house prices, depending on a number of 
explanatory variables. The relationship can 
be estimated using a panel approach based 
on price information for apartments and houses at the level of Germany’s adminis-
trative districts:3pit =  β0 + β1 sit + β2 yit + β3 ait + β4 dit + β5 uit

The regional dataset makes use not only of 
the variation over time, but also of vari-
ations in the cross- section of German dis-
tricts to determine the relationship between 
house prices and their explanatory factors. 
Experience has shown that estimation  approaches based on the relatively short aggregate time series for the German real 
estate market do not provide suffi   ciently 
 reliable results. By contrast, the compara-
tively greater dispersion of prices and vari-

J McCarthy and R Peach, Monetary policy transmission to residential investment, Federal Reserve Bank of New York Economic Policy Review, May 2002, pp 139-158.2 The housing stock is assumed to be given in the ob-servation period. The housing stock may change from one period to another as a result of residential invest-ment or demolition and conversion.3 See F Kajuth, T A Knetsch and N Pinkwart, Assessing house prices in Germany: Evidence from an estimated

ables across districts is likely to lead to esti-
mated effects of the explanatory factors 
that are more in line with the basic struc-
tural relationships of the real estate market. 
In addition, the regional dataset opens up 
the possibility of determining fundamental 
equilibrium house prices not only for Ger-
many as a whole, but also for different re-gional subsets.
For a consistent aggregation of the estima-
tion results it is required that the regression coeffi   cients are invariant across districts and 
that the model equation is linear. District- 
specifi  c explanatory factors must, moreover, be included as per capita variables.
5
The estimation takes the form of a panel 
model with random effects using the instru-
mental variables estimator suggested by 
Hausman and Taylor.6 Explanatory variables 
that might be correlated with the unob-served effect are replaced by instrumental 
variables, which are based on suitable trans-
formations of the model variables. To this end, the means of the district- specifi  c re-gressors classed as exogenous are used alongside the deviations of the district- 
specifi  c variables from their mean.A fi  rst variant comprises house price data 
and explanatory factors at the level of the 
402 districts in the period from 2004 to 2010. For the subset of 93 towns and 
cities for which price information is avail-
able since 1996, additional estimations are 
carried out over this longer time horizon. 
This primarily serves to seek evidence as to 
whether the residential real estate markets 
were, on balance, undervalued in the years 
2004 to 2010.
The results based on both estimation periods suggest that the effects of demo-graphic variables such as the population’s 
middle- aged groups and population density 
are quantitatively signifi  cant. Per capita in-
come has only a moderate impact on prop-erty prices in the shorter estimation period, while no statistically signifi  cant effect is evi-
dent over the longer horizon. All other 
things being equal, a higher housing supply 
lowers prices signifi  cantly. The unemploy-

the estimation.6 See J Hausman and W Taylor, 1981, Panel data and

ities, which has been available on an annual 
basis since 2004, is used within the framework 
of a panel model for the purpose of the study 
presented here. The specification is chosen in 
such a way that the assessment of price trends 
in relation to the development of fundamental 
factors can be performed not only for Germany 
as a whole, but also for regional subaggre -
gates. (A more detailed description of the 
model structure and details of the econometric 
estimations can be found in the box on 
pages 18 to 20.)
Using the model structure, it is possible to de -
termine for each region to what extent prices 
of apartments and houses are related to the 
selected demographic and economic determin -
ants. The deviation of the observed prices from 
this reference value can be indicated as an over 
or undervaluation. The econometric procedure 
requires that the deviations for each district – 
and thus also for each aggregate – offset each 
other throughout the estimation period from 2004 to 2010.4 This makes it more difficult to 
interpret the results directly, as it cannot be 
ruled out a priori  that residential property was 
undervalued on an average of the past ten 
years.
If the empirical finding is initially assessed 
purely with regard to price dynamics, it is ap -
parent that the prices of houses in the past 
three years have risen broadly in line with 
changes in the fundamentals. This is not just 
the case for Germany as a whole, but also for 
those regions with an urban character. By con -
trast, prices of apartments have risen more 
strongly than the reference derived from the 
model. From 2010 onwards, and for Germany 
as a whole, the actual upsurge in prices in this 
segment exceeded the trend that can be ex -Broad regional

ments in cities stronger than development of fundamentalsment rate has a signifi  cant impact on house 
prices only in the longer sample period.
In the alternative calculations using the longer period, the weight of the informa-tion from the time- series dimension in-creases relative to that from the cross- section. In particular, the effect of growth expectations on house prices is now ap-
proximately fi  ve times higher, and the result 
is also more reliable as this variable does 
not vary across districts. By contrast, the ef-
fects of district- specifi  c regressors now ap-
pear less precise. The estimation fi  t is satis-factory overall, with the explanatory power for houses slightly better.
One remarkable fi  nding is that, in all esti-mations, real interest rates have no eco-
nomically plausible and statistically measur-able infl  uence. They closely shadow growth 
expectations in the sample period, which means that their partial effect on house prices cannot be determined with suffi   cient statistical accuracy.
7
On the basis of this econometric approach, 
house prices in Germany, which have risen 
sharply in some areas since 2010, can be 
compared with their estimated fundamen-
tal equilibrium levels. The district- specifi  c 
estimation residuals, which are aggregated 
to create different regional sub- aggregates 
and a fi  gure for the economy as a whole 
using population shares, serve as a measure of overvaluation or undervaluation.

cit, for an analysis of the effect of interest rates under a calibration approach.
8 For some explanatory variables, data are currently 
only available to end-2010. Figures for the years 2011 and 2012 were extrapolated by assuming that the rate 
of change for the district- specifi  c shares of the ex-
planatory factors in the economy as a whole recorded 
in 2010 continued to apply in the two subsequent years. Price data, by contrast, are available up until 
end-2012.
4 The estimation period is selected in a way which ensures 
that the property price rises in the years 2011 and 2012, 
the assessment of which is the focus of the analysis, are 
not already incorporated when determining the reference 
value.Deutsche Bundesbank

plained by demographic and economic factors 
by a total of 7½ percentage points. The in -
crease was, in fact, twice as high for the seven 
major German cities. This would suggest that, 
especially in the urban centres, price rises have 
occurred which are difficult to justify in terms 
of fundamental factors.5
The price dynamics would have led to a per -
ceptible overvaluation only if property prices in 
the urban centres were not significantly under -
valued in the second half of the past decade. 
One way of checking this condition is provided 
by the estimation of the model using data for 
93 towns and cities from 1996 onwards.6 To 
this end, part of the information has to be fore -
gone from a regional perspective. The ex -
tended estimation period does, however, allow 
a better assessment of the trend in property 
prices. The quite considerable decline in real 
property prices between 1996 and 2006 can 
thus be matched with the deterioration in long- 
term growth expectations that was also tend -
ing to occur during this period. The impact of 
expectations on house prices can also be dem -
onstrated using other model classes and with 
respect to other countries (see the box on 
pages 22 and 23).
Looking at the 93 urban municipalities, the 
model calculations show that apartments could have been overvalued by around 10% in 2012. 
In the seven major German cities, prices could 
even have exceeded their long- term equilib -
rium level by as much as 15% to 20% of late (ie 
including the price rises in the first half of 
2013). When classifying the results, it is import -
ant to bear in mind that the estimations are 
based on a model specification in which the 
real interest rate does not have any autono -
mous influence. When deriving property prices 
that are justified by the fundamentals, the con -
siderable interest rate reduction in recent years 
is of negligible significance, which makes the 
results all the more plausible against the back -
drop of the special situation reflected in this 
development. Furthermore, the estimations are 
subject to the empirically well- substantiated 
condition that apartment prices over the past 
three years have shifted significantly upwards 
from a largely balanced level.Reduced long-

The inﬂ  uence of growth expectations and interest rates 
on house prices in Germany
Growth expectations and real interest rates 
are key macroeconomic variables that should 
affect activity and prices on the real estate 
markets. However, causal relationships are 
often diffi   cult to identify in empirical analyses. 
First, these variables are forward- looking fac-
tors, which are diffi   cult to measure. Second, the endogeneity of the variables also makes the application of econometric estimation methods a challenging task. In a theoretical model, however, the effects of growth ex-
pectations and interest rates on house prices 
can be explicitly modelled and examined.
We present simulations based on a real sto-chastic growth model which focuses on 
households’ behaviour on the goods and real 
estate markets. Households demand con-
sumption goods and housing. They also differ in terms of whether they wish to be lenders or 
borrowers. Households may therefore lend directly to one another.
1 Furthermore, some 
house buyers are subject to credit constraints, which can be eased through the provision of collateral.
Households make their decisions in the light 
of anticipated future developments. A cen-
tral element of the model is that private con-
sumption will adjust in the current period if 
higher per capita income is expected, as 
households try to smooth consumption over 
time. Although a change in demand condi-
tions on the real estate market results in ad-
justments to housing stock, housing supply is 
typically less elastic than the provision of consumption goods, meaning that relative 
house prices rise. An increase in the value of 
collateral in the form of real estate assets 
provides credit- constrained households with 
a larger fi  nancing volume, thus leading to additional demand and heightened price pressure on the real estate markets. The 
model considers an open economy in which the real interest rate depends on exogenous 
factors, such as the world market interest 
rate or a monetary union’s key interest rate. 
An unexpected interest rate rise causes households to reduce their expenditure be-cause saving yields higher returns, thereby 
dampening demand and prices for houses.
Expected growth in per capita income is mainly determined by future productivity 
gains. In the model, households’ current de-
mand for housing depends on their assess-
ment of trend productivity growth. If they ad-
just their perception of this trend, prices on 
the housing markets will change. It is assumed 
that households initially base their expect-
ations on their assessment of trend growth in 
the previous period and adapt them taking 
into account the current change in productiv-ity. To form expectations, permanent changes must be separated from temporary effects.
2
A study3 shows that this approach can explain 
a signifi  cant portion of the evolution in house 
prices in the United States from 1991 to 
around 2005. In particular, a large proportion of the price increases during this period seems 
to be consistent with a reaction to improved 
growth expectations at the time. However, after 2005, house prices deviate from the 
path that would have been justifi  ed based on 
perceptions of productivity at the time. As-
pects that the model does not capture could 
play a role in these deviations. These aspects 
include  fi  nancing instruments that appeared 
very  liquid at the time, the easing of lending 
conditions and expectations that were no 
longer in line with fundamental economic fac-tors.
The same model framework can be used to analyse the extent to which house prices in Germany since reunifi  cation depend on eco-

nomic growth prospects. The model is 
adapted to the situation in Germany using data on hourly productivity. There is a high degree of co- movement between the trend 
growth in productivity derived from the model 
and survey- based growth expectations. This confi  rms the impression that per capita in-
come expectations continuously deteriorated 
until around 2006. Since then, they seem to 
have stabilised at a low level.
In a fi  rst variant of the model (baseline scen-
ario), the interest rate is assumed to be con-
stant in order to isolate the effect of growth 
expectations on house prices. According to 
the results, the model is able to replicate fl  uc-tuations in house prices fairly well on the basis 
of productivity expectations alone. While 
growth prospects appeared to have a smaller 
impact on house prices during the upturn of 
2006-07, the price index has largely moved in 
line with the model results since 2009. This suggests that the comparatively sharp in-
creases in house prices since 2009 are largely due to the trend reversal of declining product-ivity and income prospects.
To incorporate the effect of interest rates, the 
constant real interest rate used in the baseline scenario is replaced by a variable interest rate in a second variant of the model. This is based 
on a risk premium that fl  uctuates over time 
and can be derived from the model relation-
ships. In a third scenario, the model contains the actual real interest rates.
4 In this case, the 
interest rates may be affected by factors that 
originate outside the model framework, par-
ticularly since the beginning of the fi  nancial 
crisis. Although the interest rate paths in the 
three model variants differ signifi  cantly, from 
2010 onwards, there is practically no differ-ence between the house price increases de-
rived from the various scenarios. Thus, interest rates seem to play a subordinate role in deter-mining house prices in the  selected model ap-proach. Instead, the  recent price increases are more likely the  result of households’ product-ivity and income expectations.

interest rate on the German money market; from 
1999, the short- term real interest rate in the euro area 
is used.House prices and macroeconomic growth expectations

Spatial dependencies  
in  residential property price 
movements
The steep rise in prices – in some cases associ -
ated with a risk of overvaluations – has so far 
been largely confined to regions with an urban 
character. On the whole, apartments have 
been affected to a greater extent than houses. 
Price rises for apartments have typically been 
the highest in the urban centres, while in the 
surrounding areas, the largest price increases 
have often been those for houses. Further -
more, demand relative to supply seems to have 
been focused more on newly constructed 
housing than on resale property.
The spatial distribution of the rise in prices for 
residential property clearly shows a dispersion 
from towns and cities to their surrounding 
areas. With regard to the future stability of the 
residential property market as a whole, it is 
therefore of key importance to investigate the 
spatial transmission channels of price impulses 
in greater depth. Generally speaking, this ne -
cessitates a geographical breakdown of the en -
tire area, as well as the specification of an (ab -
stract) interrelationship between individual re -
gions. From a statistical perspective, the admin -
istrative regional breakdown of Germany 
into 402 administrative districts and urban mu -
nicipalities has the advantage that data on resi -
dential property prices and the existing housing 
stock as well as the main demographic and 
economic determinants are available. One dis -
advantage with regard to the economic inter -
pretation, however, is that the administrative 
units cannot be construed in every case as in -
dependent property markets. Ambiguities arise, 
for instance, when the residential outskirts of 
an urban municipality lie beyond its borders. 
Moreover, a spatial relocation of housing de -
mand might be accompanied by a shift in the 
preference for a particular type of property. 
However, this aspect is not taken into consider -
ation in the context of the spatial analyses 
documented in this article, which, owing to data restrictions, can only be analysed separ -
ately for apartments and houses.7
The spatial dependencies between districts are 
identified by the common assumption in the lit -
erature that there is a direct relationship be -
tween two regions if they share a common 
border.8 In the first round, the potential spill -
over effect of a city or a district is therefore 
solely restricted to its neighbouring districts. In 
the second round, the impact typically spreads 
in a weaker form to the neighbours of the 
neighbouring districts, which also includes the 
region of origin. The model therefore provides 
for the possibility of a spreading across the en -
tire area, and also accommodates feedback ef -
fects.
It stands to reason that it takes time for spill -
over effects to spread throughout a geograph -
ical area. Considering the spatial and temporal 
dimension of the spillover effects in an inte -
grated manner, however, presents an analytical 
challenge. Moreover, there are limitations with 
regard to data availability, as such complex 
model structures can be estimated with any 
reasonable degree of accuracy only if the stat -
istical basis is extensive along both dimensions. 
For reasons of simplicity, the temporal aspect is 
disregarded in the remainder of this article. In 
order to take account of the fact that, in reality, 
these spatial effects do not occur contempor -
aneously, the studies are based on data which 
span time periods of several years.
For the past three years, it can be confirmed 
statistically that there has been a positive cor -

7 It would, in principle, be possible to compare the prices 
of inner- city apartments with those of houses around 
inner- city locations. This would, however, shift the perspec -
tive towards a specific behavioural pattern. From an analyt -
ical perspective, the more convincing approach is to use 
regional price series, in which the individual data for apart -
ments and houses are weighted together using the re -
spective transactions. However, these data are not avail -
able.
8 The lengths of the borders and the population density 
along the border areas are not taken into account. There

given region and in its neighbouring regions. In 
considerably more than half of the administra -
tive districts and urban municipalities, the 
changes in prices and prices in the surrounding 
areas9 were together either above or below 
average (56% for apartments and 64% for 
houses), measured against the average for Ger -
many as a whole. Furthermore, statistical tests 
clearly reject the hypothesis that an above or 
below- average change in property prices in the 
neighbouring districts occurs independently of 
the respective price movements in the district 
itself, both for apartments and houses. The cor -
relations between the rates of price changes in 
a district and those in the surrounding areas are highly significant at 0.16 for apartments 
and 0.33 for houses. The seven major cities all 
show above- average price rises for resale apart -
ments and houses. In their surrounding areas, 
the prices of houses, in particular, have risen 
more strongly than the average for Germany as 
a whole. In the case of apartments, above-  
average price growth was recorded solely in 
the neighbouring districts of Berlin, Hamburg, 
Munich and Frankfurt am Main.Positive correl-

The positive correlation between residential 
property prices in towns and cities and their 
surrounding areas can be due to various fac -
tors. The district- specific characteristics of 
demographic and economic determinants can 
be significant for neighbouring regions. Such 
exogenous interaction effects in the geograph -
ical breakdown according to administrative dis -
tricts and urban municipalities could, for ex -
ample, be due to district borders intersecting 
regional property markets. As a result, income 
gains are also likely to drive up the demand for 
housing, not least in the attractive outskirts of 
the urban areas. If the spatial price relationship 
is purely the result of exogenous interactions, 
there is no danger that the overheating of local 
property markets will spread to other areas as 
long as the determinants themselves are char -
acterised by sustainable developments.
By contrast, endogenous interaction effects are 
referred to if property prices themselves are the 
transmission channel. For instance, the pricing structure in a district could be based on the 
price structure of the neighbouring districts. 
From an analytical perspective, this mechanism 
can hardly be separated from the case where 
common factors influence the property prices 
in neighbouring property markets. This could 
include interregional characteristics such as at -
tractiveness for tourists or transport infrastruc -
ture. The common price effect may also be 
caused by unobserved phenomena, such as 
overly optimistic expectations and growing 
tendencies to speculation, which are seen as a 
trigger of price exaggerations.
To investigate whether the regional dependen -
cies in the prices for residential property are of 
an exogenous or an endogenous nature or 
whether they are based on correlated effects, 
the model relationship between property prices 
and demographic and economic determinants 
presented in the previous section is estimated, 
taking account of spatial transmission chan -
nels. In econometric terms, it is a cross- sectional Interregional

analysis of property prices for the 402 adminis -
trative districts and urban municipalities, aver -
aged over the observation period of the years 
2004 to 2010.10 The exogenous interaction ef -
fects are captured in the model specification in 
such a way that the property price level can be 
influenced by the determinants of the neigh -
bouring districts. If the price in the surrounding 
area has a statistically significant explanatory 
power in the form of an endogenous spatial 
lag in the regression, there is evidence of an 
endogenous interaction and/or correlated ef -
fects.
Compared with a cross- section estimation ex -
cluding spatial effects, the endogenous and ex -
ogenous spatially lagged variables yield, in 
some cases, considerable improvements in 
terms of explaining district- specific property 
prices. In the case of houses, three- quarters of 
the regional price differences can be explained 
using the spatial model, compared with about 
two- thirds when using only the characteristics 
of the determinants from the district itself. For 
apartments, the explanatory power of the 
model increases only marginally to just under 
half of the observed price differences. The re -
sults support the hypothesis that exogenous 
interaction effects matter. Furthermore, it is 
shown that the prices that are attained in the neighbouring districts are also an important ex -
planatory factor.
Exogenous interaction effects form the basis of 
the price effects generated by the demographic 
and econometric determinants of the neigh -
bouring regions. These indirect effects aug -
ment the direct effects, which are caused by 
the same exogenous factors in the district itself. 
On the whole, the indirect effects are percep -
tible and are often of no less significance than 
the direct effects. This applies to the prices of 
houses,11 in particular, where half of the overall 
impact of the housing stock, the age structure 
and the unemployment rate can be attributed 
to direct effects, on the one hand, and half to 
indirect effects on the other. Per capita income, 
however, has neither a direct nor an indirect 
impact on the prices of houses. Per capita in -

10 In contrast to the panel approach described in the box 
on pp 18-20, population density is not applied as an ex -
ogenous factor. This is because population density gener -
ally correlates strongly with the housing stock per inhabit -
ant. The fact that these two factors temporarily exhibit 
different lines of development and can thus trigger price 
effects is one aspect which can be illustrated by the panel 
approach, but not by the cross- sectional analysis.
11 One reason for this could be that the search radius of 
households interested in single-  family houses tends to be 
greater than in the case of potential apartment buyers.Deutsche Bundesbank

nel.12 The impact of other exogenous variables 
on apartment prices seems to be primarily of a 
direct nature.
According to the regression results, property 
prices in the surrounding areas also play an es -
sential role. The econometric analysis leaves 
open the question as to whether this is to be 
regarded as more of a purely price- based trans -
mission channel or as a significant effect of in -
terregional, non- observable characteristics. The 
risk that expectation- driven processes and 
speculative behaviour foster the regional dis -
persion of price impulses cannot, therefore, be 
ruled out entirely. Consideration also has to be 
given to the fact that potential spillover effects 
weaken significantly. According to the estima -
tion results, the price impulses are weakened 
by around one- half each time a district- border 
is crossed. Furthermore, in line with the model 
structure, the impact of the effects decreases 
all the more, the greater number of regions it 
affects. For each round – on an average of all the districts under consideration – there is a 
spillover effect on five neighbouring districts. 
The considerable dampening impact in the re -
gional dispersion can be seen, inter alia , in the 
feedback effects. These are markedly small on

Outlook
The empirical findings indicate that, so far, 
there have not been any substantial overvalu -
ations in the German property markets as a 
whole. Prices in the urban housing markets at 
present could, however, be around one-  tenth 
higher than the level which can be explained 
by demographic and economic factors alone. Impact of purely

According to the model calculations presented 
in the article, the price deviations for the par -
ticularly attractive major cities are estimated at 
up to one- fifth.
It is nevertheless very unlikely that any substan -
tial macroeconomic risks are already emerging 
from the current price structure on the housing 
markets. The observed price movements are a 
reflection of the lagged expansion of the hous -
ing supply. Furthermore, the volume of mort -
gage loans granted to households has risen 
only moderately since 2010 and, according to 
the Bank Lending Survey, banks have reported 
a tightening of their lending standards in this 
line of business.
Price pressure is not expected to ease, at least 
not in the short term. The fact that 115,000 construction permits for new apartments were 
granted in the first half of 2013 points to a fur -
ther marked rise in residential construction ac -
tivity. The resulting expansion of the housing 
supply will, however, still not be sufficient to 
meet the anticipated additional demand for 
housing, especially in light of ongoing large-  
scale immigration. A housing supply imbalance 
already exists, especially in the case of apart -
ments. Robust growth in the construction of 
multiple- family houses beyond the base level 
reached at the end of the past decade will only 
take off when investors perceive enough yield 
potential in the buy- to- let market. Against this 
backdrop, restricting the amount by which 
rents can be increased is counterproductive.Regional price

Macroeconomic approaches to assessing 
price competitiveness
Real effective exchange rates are the foremost macroeconomic indicator of a country’s price 
competitiveness. They are particularly well suited to tracking changes in competitiveness. How -
ever, in order to assess the competitiveness position, ie the price competitiveness level, they must 
be referenced to an appropriate benchmark. In practice, various approaches based on different 
economic considerations are used to calculate such a benchmark.
This article presents some of the approaches commonly used to assess a country’s competitive -
ness position and discusses the extent to which they are suitable as indicators of competitiveness. 
It focuses on an indicator that is based on the productivity approach. If it is used in conjunction 
with the deviation of the price competitiveness indicator from its long- run average in order to 
determine the competitiveness position of the German economy, both indicators currently point 
to a competitive edge for Germany on the whole. However, this edge is not so large that the Ger -
man economy’s ongoing international competitiveness may be taken for granted without further 
efforts to maintain its position in what is a rapidly changing global environment.
An assessment of price competitiveness based on the productivity approach can be applied to a 
large number of countries, including the emerging markets that are currently in an economic 
catch- up process. By way of example, this article presents the results of a competitiveness assess -
ment of the world’s three most important economies outside the euro area – the United States, 
Japan and China.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction: real effective 
exchange rates as an indica -
tor of price competitiveness
Real effective exchange rates are the most 
common proxy used to assess an economy’s 
price competitiveness. The real exchange rate is 
calculated from the nominal exchange rate and 
the ratio of the domestic price or cost level to 
the foreign price or cost level. Thus, a real ap -
preciation can arise either from a nominal ap -
preciation of the domestic currency or when 
domestic inflationary pressure exceeds that 
abroad. Both effects make domestic products 
more expensive in relation to foreign products, 
thereby causing the international price com -
petitiveness of the domestic economy to de -
teriorate.
To obtain a representative assessment of an 
economy’s price competitiveness, real effective 
exchange rates are used rather than bilateral 
exchange rates, as the former log a country’s 
competitive evolution vis-  à- vis a large number 
of trading partners. The weight assigned to a 
particular trading partner is usually determined 
by the intensity of its trade links with the coun -
try in question, whereby consideration is also 
given to trade with third countries (third- market 
effects).
The evolution of the  
German economy’s price 
competitiveness
The Bundesbank calculates a variety of such in -
dicators of price competitiveness, publishing 
some of them on a regular basis.1 The calcula -
tion method used for this purpose is standard -
ised within the Eurosystem.2 Various price and 
cost indices serve as a measure of international 
inflation differentials, whereby indices that pro -
vide comparatively broad coverage of a coun -
try’s price or cost development appear to be 
particularly useful.3If one considers, for example, the indicator of 
price competitiveness for the German econ -
omy, which is calculated on the basis of the 
deflators of total sales vis- à- vis 24 trading part -
ners, it is immediately evident that Germany’s 
competitiveness increased significantly be -
tween 1995 and 2000 before receding again 
somewhat in the years that followed.4 More 
recently a second, less dynamic improvement 
in competitiveness took place between mid-
2008 and mid-2012. Since then, the indicator 
has pointed to a moderate deterioration in 
German competitiveness.
Some light is shed on the causes of these de -
velopments when the group of trading part -
ners is divided into two groups: euro- area 
member countries and non-  euro area trading 
partners. Since the introduction of the euro in 
1999 put an end to nominal exchange rate 
fluctuations among the trading parties belong -
ing to the euro area, the indicator shows a rela -
tively low level of volatility vis- à- vis those coun -
tries over the last one- and- a- half decades. This 
highlights the fact that the introduction of the 
euro actually reduced the price risk for German 
exporters’ deliveries to the other euro-  area 
countries.
Nevertheless, this indicator shows that German 
competitiveness in relation to the other euro-  
area countries improved continuously between 
1995 and 2008. At least in the period 1999 
to 2008, this resulted exclusively from the fact Real exchange

that inflation in Germany was consistently 
lower than the weighted average for Germa -
ny’s euro- area trading partners. While the trad -
ing partners’ annual losses in competitiveness 
were small, they increased cumulatively be -
cause they persisted for over a decade follow -
ing the euro’s introduction. This development 
played a crucial role in the dislocations that 
arose during the financial and sovereign debt 
crisis in Europe. Since 2008, the indicator has 
shown only minor changes in Germany’s com -
petitiveness position in relation to the other 
euro- area states. Above all, this is a reflection 
of a recession- induced weakening of inflation -
ary pressures in some euro- area countries.The indicator that measures Germany’s price 
competitiveness vis- à- vis non- euro- area trading 
partners is determined largely by nominal ex -
change rate movements, which makes it con -
siderably more volatile than the indicator de -
scribed above. Like the overall indicator, it was 
strongly influenced by the marked improve -
ment in German competitiveness between 
1995 and 2000. Germany’s relatively low infla -
tion played a part in this improvement in the 
case of non- euro- area trading partners, too. 
The key factor, however, was the nominal de -
preciation of the D- Mark against the currencies 
outside the euro area during the last years of 
the D- Mark and that of the euro in the first two Nominal 
 exchange rate movements and Germany’s price competitiveness1 Inverted scale: a rising curve (fall in values) denotes an increase in competitiveness. • = as at 17 October 2013, estimated.

years of monetary union. This was instrumental 
in facilitating the considerable improvement of 
the overall indicator of price competitiveness 
between 1995 and 2000 by up to 19½%. Con -
versely, the equally sharp nominal appreciation 
of the euro between 2000 and 2008 was 
barely reflected in the overall indicator because 
Germany’s competitiveness vis- à- vis the other 
euro- area countries continued to improve dur -
ing that time. And, finally, the subindicator like -
wise suggests that Germany’s gains in competi -
tiveness between 2008 and 2012, when the 
tensions caused by the financial crisis reached 
their peak, as well as the subsequent competi -
tive losses were largely driven by corresponding 
developments in the euro’s nominal exchange 
rate.
Assessing the competitive -
ness position on the basis  
of long- run averages
The rate of change of the described indicators 
can be simply interpreted as an improvement 
or deterioration in price competitiveness. By 
contrast, this initially tells nothing about the 
level of such an indicator. This is mainly be -
cause price or cost indices are normally used to 
calculate an indicator level, and these are re -
lated to a particular base year. Yet even if this 
were not the case, the indicator value would 
still have to be measured against a standard or 
benchmark signifying an appropriate level of 
price competitiveness before the indicator level 
could be interpreted.
One possible benchmark for indicators of price 
competitiveness which, like the one described 
above for Germany, are based on price or cost 
indices is their long- run average. Such a bench -
mark is derived using the relative purchasing 
power parity theory,5 according to which any 
international inflation differentials are offset in 
the long term by nominal exchange rate move -
ments as a result of arbitrage transactions.6 
Thus, the norm ultimately is that, according to 
the theory, the relative price of a domestic bas -ket of goods is constant in relation to that of a 
foreign basket of goods in the long term when 
calculated in a uniform currency. If the current 
relative price (the indicator value) is markedly 
below this benchmark because, for example, 
the domestic inflation rate is comparatively 
low, the competitiveness position is considered 
to be favourable.
To enable observers to directly gauge the price 
competitiveness level, too, the indicators are 
often benchmarked in graphical representa -
tions to the long- run average, which is given 
an indicator value of 100. Using this measure 
Germany’s price competitiveness currently ap -
pears more favourable than the long- run aver -
age. In fact, the benchmark was beaten in 
1999, when the euro was introduced, and has 
been outperformed ever since then.
The choice of the time period over which the 
long- run average is calculated has little bearing 
on the fact that Germany’s competitiveness 
position may currently be considered favour -
able. For instance, if this period is shortened 
from over 38 years (calculating from the begin -
ning of 1975) to just under 18 years (calculat -
ing from the end of 1995),7 the benchmark var -
ies by less than 3% at most, which does not 
impair the quality of the assessment of the cur -
rent indicator value.

divided into countries within and outside the 
euro area, Germany’s competitiveness position 
at present turns out to be particularly favour -Benchmark

6 In Germany’s case, the euro’s introduction abolished the 
nominal exchange rate for inflation differentials vis- à- vis 
the euro- area countries through which adjustments could 
have been made. The theory can nevertheless be applied in 
this case, too, if, instead, relative prices assume any neces -
sary adjustment burdens. Although a corresponding ten -
dency may indeed be expected if the market mechanisms 
are functioning properly, the adjustment process is then 
often rather sluggish.
7 However, it is important that the observation period 
chosen for such calculations is not too short; otherwise, 
the benchmark would not be representative and the calcu -
lated average could no longer be described as “long- run”.Deutsche Bundesbank

able vis- à- vis the rest of the euro area. This im -
plies that we cannot infer from Germany’s 
strong competitiveness position that price 
competitiveness for the euro area as a whole is 
strong.
Benchmarking to the long-  run average to as -
sess the current competitiveness position has 
proved its worth in a number of ways. For in -
stance, it can be quickly and simply calculated, 
and is readily understandable. Moreover, it has 
in the past produced quite robustly plausible 
results. Yet critics point to at least two disad -
vantages of the method, particularly when the 
competitiveness position of other countries, 
too, is to be assessed.
First, as an average over time the indicator is, 
by definition, equivalent to the benchmark for 
each country on the basis of long- run averages. 
This is in keeping with the notion that imbal -
ances do not persist in the long term. Yet in the 
case at hand, this equivalence also implies that 
the price competitiveness of all countries would 
have to be interpreted as being equally good 
on average over time. However, there is some 
disagreement as to whether this is true.
Second, this method can only be applied to a 
relatively small group of countries that are 
comparatively homogeneous in economic 
terms. Particularly for countries that are in an 
economic catching-  up process, this method is 
unsuitable as a basis for calculating an appro -
priate benchmark. This is because, if long- run 
averages were used as a benchmark, the com -
petitiveness position of such countries would 
be severely underestimated at the current end, 
as is shown in the next section.
Possible alternative 
 approaches to calculating 
a benchmark
In addition to the classical concept of the pur -
chasing power parity theory described above, 
there are a number of other approaches to cal -culating benchmarks for real effective exchange 
rates which are more or less theoretically well 
founded. In the following section, some of the 
most common concepts are introduced that 
are also mostly used by international institu -
tions. Given the wide range of approaches that 
exist – some of them competing, others com -
plementary – only a selection can be presented 
here.8 The productivity approach, the Behavio -
ral Equilibrium Exchange Rate (BEER) approach 
and two of the approaches used by the Inter -
national Monetary Fund (IMF) as part of its Ex -
ternal Balance Assessment (EBA) methodology 
are outlined below.9
The different concepts can be assigned to two 
general categories. On the one hand, there are 
those that model the real effective exchange 
rate directly on the basis of one or more deter -
minants to calculate a benchmark; these in -
clude the productivity approach, the BEER ap -
proach and, closely related to it, the Real Ex -
change Rate Panel Regression approach that 
the IMF uses for its EBA. On the other hand, 
there are those that derive an adjustment need 
for the real exchange rate from deviations in 
the current account balance from a benchmark 
that may be either calculated in a number of 
different ways or posited. These include all the 
concepts that are built on the Fundamental 
Equilibrium Exchange Rate (FEER) model.
As mentioned above, the purchasing power 
parity theory is suitable for calculating a bench -
mark only for a homogeneous group of coun -
tries. Otherwise, the results can prove mislead -
ing. Whereas the purchasing power parity the -
ory assumes a constant benchmark for the real German com-
petitiveness  position vis- à- vis euro- area coun-tries particularly strong at present

age as a bench-mark is readily understandable, easy to calcu-late and offers plausible  results, …

exchange rate, the productivity approach 
– which ultimately has its origins in the work of 
Harrod, Balassa and Samuelson  – takes ac -
count of the fact that the productivity of the 
countries observed can develop asymmetrically 
during a catching- up process, thus affecting 
the benchmark.10 This theory is based on the 
notion that international price differentials in 
the non- tradable sector – which often includes 
services such as the frequently cited visit to the 
hairdresser’s  – are negligible with regard to 
competitiveness. The model asserts that if an 
emerging economy’s productivity in the trad -
able goods sector rises – assuming free labour 
mobility between the sectors and tradable 
goods prices that are determined by the global 
market – the wage level will rise not only in the 
tradable sector of the country in question but 
also in the non- tradable sector as well. Given a 
broad- based price index, the price increase 
thus induced in the non- tradable sector is re -
flected in a higher general price level, and 
therefore also in real currency appreciation 
which, however, is attributable exclusively to 
the growth in productivity in the tradable 
goods sector. If the cause of the productivity 
rise were disregarded, real appreciation would 
appear as a deterioration in the competitive -
ness of the emerging economy in question. As 
a result, it would currently be considered less 
competitive than it actually is.
The BEER approach is largely empirical and is 
loosely based on the theory of uncovered inter -
est rate parity. The real effective exchange rate 
is understood to be the sum of two compon -
ents: a short- term component made up of the 
interest rate spread and a risk premium, and a 
long- term component that is dependent on 
other determinants. The relative change in the 
domestic economy’s productivity compared 
with that of its trading partners, the net exter -
nal asset position and relative government ex -
penditure are frequently used as long- term de -
terminants. Yet this does not exhaust the list of 
potential determinants. Different studies select 
different explanatory variables. This is problem -
atical in that the benchmark calculated on the basis of this approach largely depends on the 
choice of the determinants that are included in 
the estimation – often on an ad hoc  basis and 
without theoretical foundation. While this ap -
proach can better explain real effective ex -
change rate movements ex post  than can the 
purchasing power parity theory (and the con -
stant benchmark for the real exchange rate de -
rived from it) or the productivity approach, its 
theoretical foundation is flawed given the dis -
cretionary choice of the determinants, which 
casts doubt on whether the approach can 
really serve as a basis for a benchmark for the 
real effective exchange rate.
In addition to two rather normative ap -
proaches, the IMF also uses, for the EBA, an 
approach very similar to the BEER concept (Real 
Exchange Rate Panel Regression), which in -
volves regressing, in a panel estimation, real 
 effective exchange rates on a large number of 
determinants. Based on these estimations, 
benchmarks are then calculated for the real 
 effective exchange rates of the countries in -
cluded in the estimation according to the 
country- specific determinants.11
Besides the above regression- based approach, 
which derives the benchmark for the real ef -
fective exchange rate directly from an estima -
tion with that variable as a dependent variable, 
the IMF deploys two other, indirect approaches. 
These are used to calculate the adjustment re -
quirement for the real effective exchange rate Productivity 
 approach takes account of productivity growth differ-ences between countries in  calculating the benchmark

1964, Theoretical notes on trade problems, Review of Eco -
nomics and Statistics 46, pp 145-154. It is conceivable that 
other determinants besides relative productivity growth af -
fect the benchmark (see the BEER approach, which is de -
scribed in the following section). The results presented later 
in this article demonstrate, however, that no additional 
variables are necessary to calculate a theoretically and 
econometrically substantiated benchmark.
11 Since country- specific constants (fixed country effects) 
are included in the estimation, this approach implies for 
each individual country a real effective exchange rate 
which as an average is equivalent to the benchmark, ie 
international price competitiveness which as an average is 
to be considered neutral.Deutsche Bundesbank

from the deviation of the actual current ac -
count balance from a benchmark value that 
can be determined in a number of different 
ways. The observed real effective exchange 
rate together with the calculated adjustment 
requirement can thus also be used to calculate 
a benchmark for its level. Both approaches fol -
low in the tradition of Williamson’s FEER ap -
proach (1983, 1994).12 Unlike the approaches 
described above, they rather have a normative 
character.
Under the IMF’s Current Account Panel Regres -
sion approach, the current account balances 
are first regressed in a panel estimation on vari -
ous determinants which, with very few excep -
tions, correspond to those in the Real Exchange 
Rate Panel Regression approach. In this case, 
traditional determinants are used (including the 
economy’s expected growth rate or demo -
graphic factors), along with financial market 
variables such as reserve currency status or 
measures of global risk aversion and, finally, a 
number of policy- driven factors such as the fis -
cal policy stance. Generally speaking, the ex -
planatory power of these regressions is not 
particularly high, however, and varies depend -
ing on the model specification. This partly re -
flects the high degree of model uncertainty. 
The IMF uses the results of its current account 
regression to carry out a more detailed norma -
tive analysis. To this end, the values of those 
variables that are at least partly subject to pol -
itical influence are calibrated to desired target 
values. In a second step, the deviation of the 
thus calculated current account norm from the 
actual current account balance is measured. In 
order to determine the real effective exchange 
rate adjustment necessary for the current ac -
count to match its calculated norm, the elasti -
cities between exports and imports, on the one 
hand, and the real effective exchange rate, on 
the other, are estimated. Although the ap -
proach has a better theoretical foundation on 
the whole than, say, the BEER approach, its 
suitability for determining a benchmark for the 
real effective exchange rate is open to question 
given its high model uncertainty with regard both to the current account regression and to 
calculating the trade elasticities.13
Assessing Germany’s 
 competitiveness position 
using indicators based on 
the productivity approach
The multiplicity of the above theoretical and 
econometric approaches to calculating a 
benchmark for an appropriate level of price 
competitiveness already shows that such an as -
sessment entails a degree of uncertainty that 
generally exceeds the statistically derived error 
probability for a given approach. For this rea -
son, it makes sense to base an assessment of a 
country’s competitiveness position on more 
than one of those approaches wherever pos -
sible.
Against this background, the result obtained 
using long- run averages will now be compared 
with an assessment based on the productivity 
approach, which is particularly well suited to 
assessing a country’s competitiveness position 
for several reasons. First, it is based on a theor -
etical model, which means it can provide a ro -
bust foundation for a norm. Moreover, it can 
be calculated for a wide range of economies 
including (former) emerging and transition 
countries. The advantage with regard to the 
latter is that those countries’ share of trade

13 The third approach used by the IMF is open to similar 
criticism. While the External Sustainability Approach is not 
vulnerable to uncertainty in estimating the current account 
regression, the optimal level of external debt is set in a dis -
cretionary manner, which means that this approach, too, is 
less suitable as a norm on which to base the real effective 
exchange rate.Deutsche Bundesbank

The productivity approach- based method of 
calculating benchmarks is somewhat more 
complex than merely forming long- run aver -
ages, however. The real exchange rate used 
first has to be adjusted for productivity effects. 
An econometric estimation calculates how 
strongly a country’s relative productivity affects 
its real exchange rate.
When applying the productivity approach to 
calculate the benchmark it should be noted, 
moreover, that the theory gives rise to a rela -
tionship in levels. The higher a country’s prod -
uctivity level in relation to its trading partners, 
the higher its relative price level can be without 
its price competitiveness being impaired as a 
result. However, conventional real exchange 
rates which, as described earlier, are calculated 
using price or cost indices, provide no informa -
tion on price level differences between coun -
tries. For this reason, purchasing power parities 
are drawn on as an alternative data source for 
the purposes of this study. These indicate, for a 
given country and year, how many units of 
local currency it takes to buy a broad basket of 
goods that costs a fixed US dollar amount in 
the USA. The basket includes a large number of 
goods and services (around 3,000 consumer 
goods alone), the prices of which are collected 
by the national statistical offices using a con -
sistent methodology.14 The relationship be -
tween a purchasing power parity and the cor -
responding actual nominal bilateral exchange 
rate between the two countries gives the rela -
tive price level – a real exchange rate in (rela -
tive) levels. This, in turn, is matched with a rela -
tive productivity level calculated from inter -
nationally comparable productivity data. La -
bour productivity per hour is the preferred 
productivity measure.15
Thus, the estimation provides information as to 
what relative price level can be expected given 
a specific relative productivity level. As ex -
plained above, both the price level and the 
productivity level are defined bilaterally in rela -
tion to a specific base country. However, bilat -
eral ratios provide little information about a country’s overall competitiveness. For this rea -
son, the estimation is followed by the calcula -
tion of an effective benchmark by relating the 
two variables to the respective country’s trad -
ing partners (see the box on pages 39 to 41 for 
details on calculating the effective benchmark). 
The partner countries’ weighting rises in pro -
portion to the intensity of their trading links 
with the country in question.  Finally, in a third 
step the calculated deviation from the bench -
mark is extrapolated to the current end using 
data on productivity growth, inflation and 
nominal exchange rate changes.
The resulting benchmark indicates the relative 
price level of the country in question, which is 
explained by its relative productivity level when 
the weighted average of its trading partners is 
chosen as a yardstick. If the actual relative price 
level is lower than the average, the indicator 
shows a favourable competitiveness position 
for the country in question. Applying the above 
calculation method to the German economy 
shows that Germany’s price level, adjusted for 
productivity differences, was lower of late than 
the weighted average for its trading partners. 
This indicator therefore confirms the finding al -
ready made using long- run averages, ie that 
Germany’s competitiveness position can be 
considered relatively favourable at present. The 
indicator value, which is the difference vis- à- vis 
other countries in the relative price level ad -
justed for differences in productivity, may be 
due to the fact, for example, that wage growth 
in relation to productivity growth was greater 
in other countries than in Germany.
In qualitative terms, the competitive edge cal -
culated for Germany vis- à- vis its trading part -
ners is quite small, however. The calculated in -
dicator value underlines the fact that a given

On estimating a benchmark for the real effective exchange 
rate based on the productivity approach
This box describes the procedure used to 
determine the benchmark for the real ef-fective exchange rate based on the prod-
uctivity approach. It outlines the economet-
ric model, the panel composition, the esti-
mation method and the estimation results. 
The text closes by discussing how to deter-mine a multilateral benchmark on this basis.
To calculate the infl  uence of relative prod-
uctivity on the real exchange rate (ie the 
relative price level), the econometric model
qit = αi + βxit + εit
is estimated using a panel regression where the variable 
qit denotes the log relative price 
level of the respective country i compared 
with the otherwise unconsidered but in principle arbitrarily selected base country 
Columbia at point in time t, xit is the corres-
pondingly normalised log relative productiv-
ity level and αi stands for the country- 
specifi  c constants.1
The panel encompasses up to 57 countries, 
depending on the individual model specifi  -
cation. It therefore mirrors the group of countries referenced by the ECB and the Bundesbank when they calculate real ef-
fective exchange rates for a broad group of countries.
2 The data series needed to calcu-
late the relative price level are obtained from the World Economic Outlook (WEO) database compiled by the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF), while the productivity data are taken from the Conference Board’s Total Economy Database. The relative price levels are in each case calculated by dividing 
an implicit purchasing power parity ex-
change rate available in the WEO database by the matching nominal bilateral exchange 
rate. Two measures are used to gauge the productivity level; fi  rst, labour productivity per hour and second, labour productivity 
per employee. The fi  rst of these measures is 
generally preferable as it is very unlikely to 
be affected by differences between coun-tries in the average number of working 
hours per week which is infl  uenced, for in-stance, by the percentage of part- time em-
ployees. These data are, however, only available for 46 of the 57 countries under observation, meaning that it is always ne-
cessary to use the second measure of prod-
uctivity when making an estimate for the 
remaining 11 countries. For the majority of countries, data for the period 1980 to 2011 
are included in the analysis, but for a few countries only data from 1995 onward is used.
3 This causes the panel to be unbal-
anced.
Parameter β is of key importance when ad-
justing the relative price level to take ac-
count of the impact of the relative product-
ivity level. This parameter can be interpreted as elasticity because the dependent and the explanatory variables are both log variables. 
In the estimation, parameter β is assumed 
to be homogenous, in other words it is as-
sumed to be the same for all countries in-
cluded in the panel.
1 Columbia and Peru are the only countries not in-
cluded among the observed group of countries for 
which the preferred productivity data are available 
across the entire period of observation. As Peru experi-
enced hyperinfl  ation during the 1980s, Columbia is 
chosen as the base country.2 See M Schmitz, M de Clercq, M Fidora, B Lauro and 
C Pinheiro (2012), Revisiting the effective exchange 
rates of the euro, ECB Occasional Paper No 134.
3 Data for the period prior to these years are either 
unavailable or are excluded from the analysis owing to 
the distorting effect that such data are, theoretically, 
expected to have when estimating the coeffi   cients. Such anticipated distortion results from the lack of a 
functioning price mechanism due either to hyperinfl  a-tion or centrally planned economies.Deutsche Bundesbank

Prior to computing the above model, a pre-
paratory analysis is made which affects the choice of estimation method. As a fi  rst step, a suitable panel unit root test is used to es-tablish whether the variables are stationary 
or non- stationary.4 It is not possible to re-
ject the null hypothesis of non- stationarity 
for either variable. The fact that it is neces-sary to assume non- stationarity on the part 
of the log relative price level suggests that 
this group of countries and this estimation 
period require at least one additional vari-
able to determine a benchmark that can 
substantiate a norm and be interpreted in a 
meaningful manner. As the log relative 
productivity level is also non- stationary, it qualifi  es as an acceptable long- run deter-minant, not just in theoretical terms but 
also from a statistical perspective.
In order to avoid a spurious regression be-
tween non- stationary variables, panel coin-
tegration tests are conducted as a second 
step of the analysis. If a cointegrating rela-
tion is detected between the variables, no 
spurious regression exists. Use is made of a family of panel cointegration tests based on 
an error- correction model developed by 
Joakim Westerlund (2007).5 These tests all 
rest on the notion of the need for a signifi  -
cant adjustment towards long- run equilib-
rium if a long- run relationship between the 
variables exists. Unlike many other ap-proaches, the tests inter alia take into ac-
count dependencies between the different 
countries (ie cross- sectional dependence), 
as does the panel unit root test used above. 
Such dependencies are to be expected, not 
least because of the common base country. 
The test results point to the existence of a 
long- run relationship between the relative 
price level and the relative productivity level.
In a third step, the above model is esti-
mated using a simple panel fi  xed effects re-
gression,6 according to which the long- run elasticity of the relative price level vis- à- vis 
the relative productivity level is gauged at 
0.35 if the latter is approximated in terms of 
labour productivity per employee, and at 
0.47 if this is instead done based on labour productivity per hour. To test the robustness of the results, the estimation is alternatively conducted using the pooled OLS estimator 
along with the panel DOLS estimator de-
veloped by Mark and Sul (2003),7 in which 
case the point estimates diverge only 
slightly from the previous results. The table 
on page 41 provides an overview of the various estimated long- run elasticities, de-
pending on the choice of estimator and the 
variables used to approximate the relative 
productivity level.
As all the variables contained in the estima-
tion were placed in relation to the base 
country, thus rendering them bilaterally nor-
malised, they have to be placed in a multi-lateral context if a meaningful benchmark is to be determined. To this end, the weighted 
average of the partner countries is sub-tracted from the log relative price level of 
country i

it = qit − Σwij qjt ,
whereby wii = 0 and Σwij = 1. If the multi-
lateral normalised relative productivity level

time may not persist and that maintaining it re -
quires ongoing efforts both to foster techno -
logical progress, product and process innov -
ations so as to boost productivity and to keep 
wage and price developments in line with it. 
This is the only way that an open economy 
such as Germany can safeguard its market pos -
ition in a dynamic global economic environ -
ment and offer attractive employment oppor -
tunities.
The price competitiveness 
of other economies
As mentioned above, one of the advantages of 
the productivity approach-  based indicator of 
price competitiveness is that it can be calcu -
lated for a large number of countries; more -
over, it can be interpreted in economic terms. 
To illustrate this, results for the USA, Japan and 
China –  the three largest economies outside 
the euro area – are presented below.The indicator shows the United States to be in 
an exceptionally favourable competitiveness 
position. Whereas the price level in the USA is 
only marginally above the weighted average 
for its trading partners, US productivity exceeds 
that of its trading partners considerably. This 
positive assessment applies both to the current 
situation and to the year 2007, when the finan -
cial and economic crisis started.16 As the USA is 
one of the established advanced economies, 
an alternative indication can be provided for 
the USA in comparison with the long- run aver -
age. This indicator likewise points to a competi -
tive advantage.
This finding may initially come as a surprise 
given that the USA has posted a trade deficit Favourable com-
petitiveness pos-ition for the USAmultilateral benchmark q~
it* for the relative 
price level can be computed as

using the estimated slope coeffi   cient ^β. The 
(log) deviation from the benchmark d~
it is 
then conveyed as

it* .
If d~
it is positive, the actual price level in 
country i relative to the price levels in its 
partner countries exceeds the benchmark 
value that would have been expected given 
its relative productivity level. This would put the country in an unfavourable competitive position.Estimated long- run elasticities

16 Looking further back in time, however, there were also 
periods in which US competitiveness was low according to 
this indicator. This is especially true of the mid-1980s, be -
fore the G5 group of countries agreed under the Plaza Ac -
cord in September 1985 to take internationally coordinated 
economic and monetary policy measures aimed at weak -
ening the US dollar.Deutsche Bundesbank

Development of the indicator of Germany’s price 
 competitiveness based on the productivity approach – a graphical representation
A graphical representation of the indicator 
based on the productivity approach facili-
tates the interpretation of the results. Com-
binations of Germany’s relative price level 
and relative productivity are shown for dif-
ferent points in time. The variables are loga-
rithmised and shown in relation to the 
weighted average of the trading partners, with the result that Germany’s price and productivity level corresponds to the aver-
age in the partner countries at the origin of the coordinate system. By contrast, positive 
values imply a price or productivity level 
that exceeds the respective average of the 
trading partners. At the origin, where the 
German price and productivity level matches 
that of the other countries, the indicator shows a neutral price competitiveness for 
Germany. The same applies to all the dots 
on the dashed straight line from the origin 
with a positive slope, which indicates the price increase that would be justifi  ed for 
any given productivity growth according to the estimation. Dots above the straight line indicate a price level that is too high to be justifi  ed by productivity, and therefore point to an unfavourable competitive position.
However, the estimated current value for 
Germany lies below the straight line. There-fore, although the price level for Germany is 
above its trading partners’ weighted aver-
age, relative productivity is so high in Ger-
many that the indicator nevertheless points

to a favourable competitive position. The 
calculated competitive advantage is rela-
tively small, however.
The dots that are connected with a line in 
the chart show the development of the in-
dicator for Germany over time and repre-sent indicator values for successive years. The indicator shows a rather favourable 
price competitiveness for Germany for the 
1980s, and in particular for 1985, which was the year in which the US dollar re-corded an historical high against the D-Mark. However, in the fi  rst half of the 1990s, the relative price level increased 
quite sharply in Germany without this being 
accompanied by corresponding gains in 
productivity. This development is – despite 
the knock- on effects of German reunifi  ca-
tion – attributable only to a relatively small 
extent to infl  ation differentials with other 
countries. Instead, the key reason was the 
nominal exchange rate development of the D-Mark. During that period, the then Euro-
pean Monetary System entered a severe 
 crisis, in the course of which the currencies 
of several partner countries signifi  cantly 
 depreciated against the D-Mark.
For 1995, the chart suggests a marked year- 
on- year increase in both relative productiv-
ity and the relative price level in Germany. 
However, this development is due, in part, 
to a structural break. The group of partner 
countries included was extended in 1995 by 
a large number of – above all central and east European  – economies, which were 
undergoing a transition process at the time. 
This expansion had the effect of consider-
ably lowering the German trading partners’ 
average productivity level as well as their 
average price level. Germany’s relative price and productivity level therefore increased at 
that point. The transition countries could 
not be regarded as partner countries prior 
to this expansion. In some cases, there was a lack of adequate data, but above all the 
market mechanisms that would have 
allowed for a price adjustment in line with 
the theory were not in place in the centrally 
planned economies. In the 1990s, it was not only market mechanisms that became 
increasingly important in these countries in 
the course of the transition process; there 
was also a disproportionate growth in Ger-
many’s trade links with them. With regard 
to the indicator’s representativeness, this meant that these economies could no 
longer be disregarded. Due to the change-over, the in reality slightly more steady inte-
gration of economic structures is concen-
trated in one year for the statistics.
The fact that the indicator value for 1995 
shows a particularly unfavourable competi-
tive position for Germany is nevertheless 
well in line with conventional indicators of 
price competitiveness, for example. In its 
1995-96 Annual Report, the German Coun-
cil of Economic Experts also established a 
real appreciation, which could “not be ex-
plained by looking at the fundamental 
macroeconomic data”.1 It was not until the 
nominal effective appreciation of the 
D-Mark came to an end in the second half 
of the 1990s that – coupled with ongoing 
below- average infl  ationary pressures – the indicator came closer to its benchmark 
value again. Since then, changes to the in-dicator have been comparatively small, not least owing to Germany becoming a mem-ber of European monetary union.

for many years. However, it has to be borne in 
mind that the trade balance is determined not 
only by an economy’s international competi -
tiveness but by other determinants as well. Par -
ticular importance is usually attached to aggre -
gate demand in the countries in question. In 
fact, the combination of persistently strong 
price competitiveness and continued trade def -
icits in the USA could indicate that the cause of 
the latter lies less in the US dollar exchange 
rate and more in the fact that the US saving 
ratio has been rather low for a long time, which 
tends to encourage a high level of imports.In contrast to Germany and the USA, the prod -
uctivity approach- based indicator for Japan 
suggests an unfavourable competitiveness pos -
ition both in the recent past and when the cri -
sis began in 2007. It should, moreover, be 
noted that the marked depreciation of the yen 
observed for around a year now has already led 
to a substantial improvement in the inter -
national competitiveness of the Japanese econ -
omy; in other words, the indicator previously 
pointed to even more serious competitive dis -
advantages for Japan.
However, if an indicator that is calculated on 
the basis of the long- run average is applied in -
stead, the assessment of Japan’s competitive -
ness position changes perceptibly and currently 
indicates a relatively favourable competitive -
ness position for Japan. The reason for this ap -
parent discrepancy between the two indicators 
is that, with the concept of long- run averages, 
the main focus is on the time dimension. By 
historical standards, Japanese competitiveness 
is currently high according to both indicators. 
Despite this progress, the current indicator 
based on the productivity approach calculates 
a weak Japanese competitiveness position be -
cause the price level there continues neverthe -
less to exceed the average level for its trading 
partners. By contrast, the productivity level 
– seen from a macroeconomic perspective – is 
below the corresponding average. The fact 
that the price level in Japan has exceeded that 
of its trading partners for quite some time now 
without producing a sufficient, offsetting real 
depreciation could indicate that this situation 
was caused by structural factors such as high 
market access barriers.
China is one of those economies that have 
been undergoing an economic catching- up 
process for years. For this reason, it would not 
be appropriate to assess the country’s competi -
tiveness position using long- run averages. In -
stead, it makes sense to use a productivity-  
based indicator, which currently diagnoses an 
unfavourable competitiveness position for 
China. Moreover, the indicator points to a pro -US trade bal-

gressive deterioration in competitiveness over 
the last few years. This development is attribut -
able not only to a gradual nominal effective ap -
preciation of the renminbi, but above all to 
China’s high inflation compared with that of its 
trading partners. Although China has recorded 
continuous relative productivity gains, they 
have not been sufficient to offset the above ef -
fects on price competitiveness.
Summary
In many cases, real effective exchange rates are 
good indicators of changes in price competi -
tiveness. However, in order to shed light on a 
country’s level of competitiveness, the indicator has to reference a suitable benchmark. Various 
approaches to calculating the benchmark are 
possible. For this reason alone, caution is called 
for when interpreting the results.
Different indicators arrive at a uniform assess -
ment for Germany. Thus the competitiveness 
position of the German economy is currently 
somewhat more favourable than the long- run 
average. An alternative, productivity approach- 
based indicator likewise points to small com -
petitive advantages for Germany at present. 
However, these are not so great that Germany 
can afford to relax its efforts to boost innov -
ation and raise productivity as well as to pursue 
a wage and price policy geared to those desid -
erata and the opportunities they create.Alternative indi-

International cooperation in the area 
of financial sector policy – the Financial 
Stability Board (FSB)
On the Financial Stability Board (FSB), central banks, finance ministries and supervisory authorities 
of the most important economies work together with international financial institutions and 
standard setting bodies. The Bundesbank is a member of the FSB and already formed part of its 
predecessor, the Financial Stability Forum (FSF). The FSB continuously monitors the stability of the 
global financial system and promotes financial sector regulation. Following the mandate pro -
vided by the G20 heads of state and government, at the beginning of this year the FSB was 
placed on an enduring organisational footing, with legal personality, greater financial autonomy 
and strong internal governance. The FSB is the G20’s central point of contact for all financial 
 sector issues and therefore now forms an integral part of international financial sector policy 
making.
The G20 assigned the FSB a leading role in analysing and learning the lessons of the financial 
crisis and tasked it with regular reporting to the highest political level. Key FSB duties include deal -
ing with systemically important financial institutions and improving the oversight and regulation 
of the shadow banking system. To achieve these aims, the FSB has created a comprehensive regu -
latory framework and is rigorously promoting its implementation. The FSB’s role as a cross- sector 
coordinator has added a new dimension to international financial sector policy.
The members of the FSB have undertaken to apply international standards and implement agreed 
reforms consistently and on schedule. The FSB insists on compliance with this undertaking and 
monitors implementation by means of peer reviews, among other methods. Given that the FSB’s 
recommendations are not legally binding, political support from the G20 remains crucial to the 
body’s success and the regulatory response to the financial crisis in general.Deutsche Bundesbank

From the Financial Stability

The Financial Stability Board (FSB) coordinates

lished upon a proposal made by the Bundes -

meeting of the G7 finance ministers and cen -
tral bank governors in February 1999.2 The FSF, 
based at the Bank for International Settlements 
(BIS) in Basel, was founded on the idea of a 
permanent “round table” designed to address 
issues regarding the strengthening of the inter -
national financial system across national bor -
ders, sectors and institutions.3
The global financial crisis significantly increased 
the FSF’s importance. In response to the crisis, 
the G7 assigned the FSF a key role in reforming 
financial sector regulation. Owing to the global 
nature of the crisis, the G20, which also en -
compasses the key emerging market econ -
omies, superseded the G7 as the most import -
ant informal intergovernmental forum for inter -
national economic and fiscal policy cooper -
ation. Given this shift in informal international 
cooperation from the G7 to the G20 and the 
enhanced status of the FSF, associated with its 
role in analysing and learning the lessons of the 
crisis, it appeared advisable to fundamentally 
reform the FSF. This reform was fleshed out 
and implemented in several steps over the 
period between 2009 and 2013.
Following the bankruptcy of US investment 
bank Lehman Brothers in September 2008 and 
the dramatic intensification of the international 
financial crisis triggered by that event, a “world 
financial summit” at the level of G20 leaders 
was held for the first time in Washington DC in 
November 2008. At this summit, the G20 lead -
ers called for a larger FSF membership. In 
March 2009, the remaining G20 countries not 
represented in the FSF, as well as Spain and the European Commission, joined the FSF. At the 
April 2009 London summit, the G20 leaders re -
solved to re- establish the FSF as the Financial 
Stability Board (FSB). At the subsequent Pitts -
burgh summit in September 2009, the G20 
countries ratified the FSB Charter, based on the 
London summit recommendations, defining 
the objectives, mandate and membership of 
the FSB.
At their Cannes summit in November 2011, the 
G20 leaders resolved to give the FSB legal per -
sonality and greater financial autonomy. An 
FSB working group chaired by Bundesbank 
President Jens Weidmann was commissioned 
with developing recommendations to this ef -
fect.4, 5 The G20 leaders adopted these recom -
mendations at their Los Cabos summit in June 
2012. The FSB was founded as an association

Key elements of institutional 
improvements to the 
 Financial Stability Board
In order to maintain the FSB’s informal charac -
ter under the reform, it was deliberately not es -
tablished as an international organisation based 
on an intergovernmental treaty. Converting it 
into an association enabled the FSB’s formal 
role in the framework of international institu -
tions to be maintained without necessitating 
any fundamental change to its organisational 
structure and method of functioning. Its mem -
bers still have the final say on all major issues 
and also on the development of recommenda -
tions and standards. This is also appropriate 
given that sovereignty in the area of financial 
sector regulation has not been transferred, or 
has been transferred to only a limited extent, to 
the supranational level. This means that the FSB 
can still be classified as being engaged in infor -
mal international cooperation; it cannot adopt 
legally binding decisions, nor can it enforce its 
own decisions by taking coercive measures 
against its members. Its decisions are enforced 
instead through self- commitments by its mem -
bers. The FSB’s ongoing monitoring of imple -
mentation progress, its regular reports to the 
G20 and peer reviews all help in this regard.
The FSB has established procedures to promote 
contact with other countries outside the 
bounds of its membership (known as out -
reach). Non- members are integrated into the 
FSB’s work through Regional Consultative 
Groups, of which there are six at present.6 Re-
gional and global risks and vulnerabilities in the 
financial system and issues relating to financial 
sector regulation are discussed at their meet -
ings, which also provide non- members with a 
forum to put forward their own proposals and 
initiatives. Several Regional Consultative Groups 
have also set up working groups to study issues 
of particular relevance for their region more in -
tensively. All in all, the FSB’s outreach places its 
work on broader foundations without impair -
ing its ability to function with its relatively lean 
structures.In its new legal form, the FSB remains closely 
tied to the BIS. Under the BIS’s existing Head -
quarters Agreement, the FSB has the usual im -
munity and privileges for international organ -
isations based in Switzerland. Its relations with 
the BIS mean that it can continue to use syner -
gies associated with the “Basel Process” of in -
formal cooperation between central banks, 
supervisory authorities and standard setters in 
the area of supervision and regulation. The 
physical proximity of the numerous Basel- based 
bodies promotes the exchange of information, 
helps avoid overlaps or gaps in work pro -
grammes and thus makes the work of all par -
ties involved easier. This issues- oriented Basel 
Process is a very valuable tool for promoting 
international cooperation in the area of finan -
cial sector regulation.
By signing a temporary five- year service agree -
ment with the BIS, the FSB has achieved greater 
financial autonomy within an agreed budgetary 
framework. Its funding is being provided fully 
by the BIS for the time being; the FSB has opted 
not to collect membership fees at this stage. 
This ensures a reliable underlying source of 
funding. At the same time, this funding model 
is flexible enough to be adjusted to any future 
changes in the FSB’s tasks and also to compen -
sate for longer- run fluctuations in funding re -
quirements. The FSB’s staff is still employed by 
the BIS; however, the FSB is largely independ -
ent in its staffing decisions.
The FSB has also updated its internal govern -
ance structure. A Standing Committee on 
Budget and Resources, created in November 
2012, is now responsible for financial govern -
ance. This committee is tasked with assessing 
resource needs, preparing the budget, moni -
toring budgetary implementation, and financial 
reporting. In addition, the FSB’s internal work -
ing procedures have been standardised and Establishment as

streamlined. There are now guidelines which 
govern the preparation of meetings and specify 
how public consultation procedures should be 
implemented in practice. This therefore spells a 
provisional end to the evolutionary process 
from FSF to FSB.
Organisation and functioning 
of the FSB
Like its predecessor, the FSF, the FSB is set apart 
by its cross-  border, cross-  sector and inter-  
institutional character. Since all important fi -
nancial centres are represented on the FSB, and 
its members have a broad range of expertise, 
current issues are investigated from a variety of 
perspectives and can be brought to the atten -
tion of a wide array of stakeholders. Therein 
lies the FSB’s crucial advantage over other bod -
ies and institutions which are also active in the 
field of financial stability but have a more spe -
cific focus. The FSB Charter distinguishes be -
tween three categories of members.
– National and regional authorities.
– International financial institutions.
– International standard setting bodies.
Germany is represented on the FSB by the 
Deutsche Bundesbank, the Federal Ministry of Finance and the Federal Financial Supervisory 
Authority (BaFin). Its three FSB members liaise 
closely and continuously at both management 
and expert level.
The FSB plays a pivotal role in the framework of 
international institutions. It is firmly anchored in 
the central banking sphere thanks to the key role 
in its membership played by central banks, from 
which all FSF and FSB chairs have come thus far, 
and to the FSB’s close ties to the BIS. However, 
the FSB also relies on international standard set -
ting bodies, in which national supervisory au -
thorities play a crucial role, and coordinates their 
work. Moreover, the FSB has close contacts with 
political bodies, especially the G20.
The FSB works closely with the IMF. The funda -
mental division of tasks between the two or -
ganisations was laid out in November 2008 in 
a letter to the G20 finance ministers and cen -
tral bank governors written jointly by the FSF’s 
then- Chair Mario Draghi and the then-  
Managing Director of the IMF, Dominique 
Strauss- Kahn. The IMF is responsible for the 
surveillance of the global financial system and 
of its members’ macro policies. The FSB (like its 
predecessor, the FSF) is responsible for elabor -
ating international financial sector supervisory 
and regulatory policies and standards and co -
ordinating the activities of various international FSB unites key

standard setting bodies, as well as analysing 
potential vulnerabilities in the global financial 
system. The IMF provides relevant expert input 
as a member of the FSB and thus also has an 
advisory function in the standard setting pro -
cess. Overall, the division of tasks between the 
FSB and IMF has stood the test of time and is a 
successful example of the interplay between in -
formal and formal cooperation.
One major area of cooperation between the 
FSB and the IMF is the early warning exercises, 
which have been conducted twice a year since 
2009. These exercises unite traditional financial 
stability analysis with a global macroeconomic 
perspective. The FSB and IMF analyse macrofi -
nancial and financial sector- related systemic 
risks, with a particular emphasis on cross- sector 
and cross- border interlinkages. The results of 
the early warning exercises and consequent 
recommendations for further action are pre -
sented to the International Monetary and Fi -
nancial Committee (IMFC) of the IMF.The FSB also collaborates with the private sec -
tor, amongst other things by inviting private 
sector representatives to attend specific meet -
ings and participate in selected working groups. 
Involving the private sector at an early stage, 
including by means of public consultations, 
helps to ensure that the initiated financial sec -
tor reforms are built on broad foundations.
The FSB discharges its tasks through plenary 
meetings. The Plenary sets the strategic and 
business policy guidelines and regulates all 
working procedures and processes. It approves 
the work programme and budget and adopts 
reports developed by the FSB, including prin -
ciples, standards, recommendations and guid -
ance. The Plenary also decides on membership, 
appoints the Chair7 and decides on any amend -
ments to the FSB Charter. Decisions are taken … in semi-

vote.
Between the plenary meetings, the Steering 
Committee guides and monitors the progress 
of the FSB’s ongoing work, coordinates the 
work of the various committees and working 
groups and ensures the effective flow of infor -
mation. The Plenary’s decisions are prepared by 
Standing Committees. The four Standing Com -
mittees currently in existence are
– the Standing Committee on Assessment of 
Vulnerabilities (SCAV),
– the Standing Committee on Supervisory and 
Regulatory Cooperation (SCSRC),
– the Standing Committee on Standards Im -
plementation (SCSI) and
– the Standing Committee on Budget and Re -
sources (SCBR).
The Plenary may establish additional Standing 
Committees as necessary. Working groups can 
also be established to deal with specific finan -
cial sector issues. These working groups report 
either to the Standing Committees or directly 
to the Plenary or Steering Committee. The Sec -
retariat supports all FSB activities, including the 
work of the Standing Committees and working 
groups. The Secretariat is directed by a Secre -
tary General on a full- time basis.
Work areas
Ongoing analysis of the 
 stability of the global financial 
system
In its ongoing analysis, the FSB looks at the cur -
rent risk situation in the financial system, eg in 
relation to asset price bubbles, the build- up of 
excessive leverage, credit quality and the impli -
cations of a protracted period of low interest 
rates. These analyses also focus on risks result -
ing from longer-  term or structural develop -
ments in the financial system, such as changes 
in the refinancing behaviour of financial institu -tions, the emergence of new investment cat -
egories and the transfer of financial risks. The 
main focus of the analysis is always on systemic 
risks, ie endogenous mechanisms stemming 
from the financial system that can cause or 
amplify crises.
Regulatory policy
The FSB is now established as the central forum 
for converting the regulatory and supervisory 
lessons learned from the financial crisis into 
 reform measures at the global level. In this con -
text, the G20 has assigned the FSB a range of 
tasks with specific implementation deadlines. 
To fulfil these tasks, the FSB cooperates closely 
with national and international bodies and au -
thorities, including the responsible standard 
setters in particular.
Reducing the risks arising from systemically 
important financial institutions
A core area of the FSB’s regulatory work is a 
multi- layered approach to dealing with system -
ically important financial institutions (SIFIs). The 
aim is to reduce the systemic risks and incentive 
distortions (moral hazard) arising from these in -
stitutions. At their summit in Seoul in Novem -
ber 2010, the G20 leaders adopted a policy 
framework designed for this purpose by the 
FSB,8 which contains the following core elem -
ents.
– A resolution framework and other measures 
to ensure that all financial institutions can be 
resolved without destabilising the financial 
system or exposing taxpayers to the risk of 
loss
– A higher loss- absorbency capacity, initially 
for global SIFIs in particularSteering Com-
mittee, Standing Committees and working groups take forward FSB’s work

– More intensive supervisory oversight for fi -
nancial institutions that may pose systemic 
risk
– More robust financial market infrastructures 
to reduce contagion risk that may arise from 
the failure of individual institutions
Intensive work has since been carried out on 
the individual components of this SIFI regula -
tory framework. The central components in -
clude the FSB’s “Key Attributes of Effective 
Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions” 
published in November 2011, which established 
a new international standard.9 This standard 
applies not only to banks but also to insurers, 
financial market infrastructures and investment 
firms. Together with the responsible standard 
setters, the FSB is working on adapting the Key 
Attributes to each of the various types of finan -
cial institution. In order to support the imple -
mentation of the Key Attributes on the national 
level, the FSB published guidelines in July 2013 
on key aspects of the recovery and resolution 
of financial institutions.10 Global application of 
the Key Attributes should allow even complex, 
globally integrated financial institutions to be 
resolved without severe market turmoil.
Another core element of the SIFI framework is 
to make institutions more resilient by increasing 
their loss- absorbency capacity. Based on a 
methodology developed by the Basel Commit -
tee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), the FSB 
published a list of 29 global systemically im -
portant banks (G-  SIBs) in November 2011. The 
list was first updated in November 2012, revis -
ing the number of G-  SIBs to the current figure 
of 28. The FSB will continue to update the list 
once a year and publish it each November. De -
pending on the systemic importance of the in -
stitution in question, the requirements for core 
tier 1 capital will increase between 1.0 and 
2.5 percentage points (G-  SIB surcharge). This 
additional loss- absorbency requirement will be 
phased in over a three- year period, beginning 
in 2016.11Alongside G-  SIBs, stricter rules will also be im -
posed on banks that are systemically important 
at the national rather than the global level, 
known as domestic systemically important 
banks (D-  SIBs). In cooperation with the FSB, 
the BCBS has developed a framework of prin -
ciples for dealing with D-  SIBs, which was pub -
lished in October 2012 and is now being imple -
mented by the  responsible national author -
ities.12
Another key focus of the FSB’s current work is 
on the issue of insurers’ systemic importance. 
On behalf of the FSB, the International Associ -
ation of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) has de -
veloped an assessment methodology for identi -
fying global systemically important insurers (G- 
SIIs). Using this methodology, the FSB published 
an initial list of nine G-  SIIs in July 2013. This list 
will be updated once a year; a decision will be 
made on the G-  SII status of major reinsurers in 
July 2014. In future, insurers identified as sys -
temically important will be subject to specific 
regulatory requirements. This will involve more 
stringent supervision, along with measures 
 designed to improve resolvability. Capital sur -
charges are also planned from 2019 onwards.13
Finally, the SIFI framework will also apply to in -
stitutions outside the banking and insurance 
sectors. The FSB is working with the Inter -
national Organization of Securities Commis -
sions (IOSCO) to develop an assessment meth -
odology for identifying systemically important New inter-
national stand-ard for  resolution  regimes …

non- bank non- insurance financial institutions. 
In cooperation with IOSCO and the Committee 
on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS), 
work is also underway to extend the SIFI frame -
work to financial market infrastructures.
The SIFI work of the FSB and its members from 
the group of standard setting bodies is already 
well advanced in conceptual terms. The inter -
nationally agreed rules now have to be trans -
posed into national law. Until this happens, the 
systemic importance of financial institutions 
will continue to be a serious problem for the 
international financial system.
Oversight and regulation of the shadow 
banking system
In addition to addressing the SIFI problem, the 
FSB is also focused on improving the oversight 
and regulation of the shadow banking system. 
Prior to the global financial crisis, the shadow 
banking system played a crucial role in the 
build- up of vulnerabilities in the international fi -
nancial system. Moreover, the stricter regula -
tion of the banking sector initiated through the 
G20 reform agenda heightens the risk of fur -
ther activities being shifted to the shadow 
banking system.
The work of the FSB was initially concentrated 
on identifying and defining the shadow bank -
ing system. As a first step, the FSB published a 
definition of the term “shadow banking sys -
tem” in April 2011, describing it as “credit inter -
mediation involving entities and activities out -
side the regular banking system”. In this con -
text, risks may arise, above all, from liquidity 
and maturity transformation, flawed risk trans -
fer and high leverage.14 Since 2011, the FSB has 
carried out an annual exercise to monitor the 
risks resulting from global shadow banking sys -
tems, placing particular emphasis on the 
changes and innovations that could lead to an 
increase in systemic risks and to regulatory arbi -
trage. The FSB published its second annual 
Global Shadow Banking Monitoring Report in 
November 2012, having extended the exercise coverage from 11 to 25 jurisdictions. Conse -
quently, the exercise now includes all key finan -
cial centres.
As shadow banking spans a broad range of 
topics, the FSB has divided its regulatory pro -
posals into five work streams. In this area, the 
FSB cooperates closely with standard setting 
bodies, particularly the BCBS and IOSCO. This 
work covers not only the indirect regulation of 
the shadow banking system, which addresses 
the relationships between the regular banking 
sector and the shadow banking system, but 
also the direct regulation of shadow banking 
entities and activities. The work being carried 
out simultaneously in the various work streams 
aims to
– mitigate the spillover effect between the 
regular banking system and the shadow 
banking system,
– reduce the susceptibility of money market 
funds to “runs”,
– mitigate systemic risks posed by other 
shadow banking entities,
– improve transparency and align incentives in 
securitisation,
– dampen risks and procyclical incentives as -
sociated with securities lending and repur -
chase (repo) agreements.
The FSB put forward a preliminary integrated 
overview of policy recommendations for public 
consultation in November 2012, before pub -
lishing a revised overview in August 2013.15 
Using this as a foundation, the G20 leaders 
agreed at the September 2013 Saint Petersburg 
summit upon an action plan with further spe -
cific tasks. One of the action plan objectives – 
not least on Germany’s initiative – is greater 
transparency in hedge fund activities. The rec -

tem now need to be rigorously implemented. 
This should noticeably reduce the risks to the 
financial system that arise from shadow bank -
ing. It may be assumed, however, that there 
are still incentives for the financial sector – 
which has often proved very dynamic in the 
past – to legally circumvent the applicable 
regulation using new techniques and products. 
It is therefore important for the FSB to con -
stantly monitor the evolving shadow banking 
system. The annual reports can then be used to 
examine whether the regulations need to be 
adapted.
The projects to further develop the oversight 
and regulation of the shadow banking system 
and the multi-  layered SIFI regulatory frame -
work probably would not have been possible 
without the cooperation of the FSB across na -
tional borders, sectors and institutions. The 
support of the G20 will be crucial to the pend -
ing implementation process.
Further financial sector reforms
In addition, the FSB addresses a wide range of 
other regulatory issues with the aim of elimin -
ating weaknesses in the international regula -
tory framework.16 These include, for example, 
the reform of over-  the- counter (OTC) deriva -
tives trading. The FSB is working on improving 
the stability of these markets, in particular 
through the establishment of central counter -
parties (CCPs). What is more, the FSB is striving 
to achieve a higher level of standardisation and 
urging the closure of data gaps through the re -
porting of OTC transactions to trade repositor -
ies (TRs), and cooperation within the FSB has 
led to substantial progress in this area. How -
ever, some difficulties have now arisen in the 
implementation of international agreements. In 
particular, it appears that the specific rules of 
individual jurisdictions are not always suffi -
ciently compatible, which makes it difficult to 
achieve the necessary mutual recognition of 
the respective rules.Furthermore, the FSB is making efforts to re -
duce the financial system’s reliance on credit 
rating agencies (CRAs). One objective is to re -
duce references to CRA ratings in regulatory 
frameworks. At the same time, market partici -
pants should be provided with incentives to im -
prove their own credit assessment capabilities 
and not automatically rely on CRA ratings.
Transparency in the global financial system is 
another important issue. This is the objective 
of, amongst others, an initiative to uniquely 
identify the entities participating in the financial 
market. To this end, the FSB has drawn up 
comprehensive recommendations for a global 
legal entity identifier (LEI) system and is super -
vising its implementation. Greater transparency 
is also the goal of initiatives that the FSB has 
organised jointly with the BIS and the IMF, 
which are intended to close the data gaps that 
have come to light during the crisis. In particu -
lar, this includes data on SIFIs and interconnec -
tions within the financial system. Moreover, the 
FSB assists the International Accounting Stand -
ards Boards (IASB) and the Financial Account -
ing Standards Boards (FASB) in their efforts to 
converge global accounting standards as far as 
possible. Finally, the FSB is also addressing the 
issue of how to reduce the vulnerability of fi -
nancial benchmarks to manipulation. These 
issues of a rather technical nature usually re -
ceive far less public attention than the FSB’s 
SIFI lists, for example, yet the functioning of 
these elements is crucial to the stability of the 
global financial system. Like good supervision, 
these technical issues are therefore also part 
and parcel of crisis prevention.
Application of international 
standards

FSB is to promote the internationally consistent 
application of standards and codes. Its prede -
cessor, the FSF, had already compiled a com -
pendium of the most important standards for a 
sound financial system, which has since been 
regularly updated. The standards designated as 
deserving of priority implementation from a fi -
nancial stability perspective are identified as 
“key standards” and cover 12 policy areas.17
FSB member countries assess each other’s im -
plementation of internationally agreed stand -
ards and policies through a programme of peer 
reviews, which began in 2010. A distinction is 
made here between thematic and country re -
views. Thematic reviews examine whether FSB 
recommendations are being implemented con -
sistently in the member countries. The aim of 
these reviews is to identify typical difficulties 
and weaknesses in the implementation of each 
of the examined standards as well as problems 
caused by ineffective or internationally incon -
sistent implementation. The FSB has already 
carried out thematic peer reviews on the imple -
mentation of FSB principles and standards for 
compensation practices (in 2010 and 2011), on 
risk disclosure practices and mortgage under -
writing and origination practices (in 2011), on 
deposit insurance systems (in 2012), on risk 
governance at financial institutions, on reso -
lution regimes and on the reduction of “hard-  
wired” references to CRA ratings (in 2013).
By contrast, the assessment of individual coun -
tries serves to identify the progress made in im -
plementing selected recommendations of the 
IMF’s Financial Sector Assessment Programs 
(FSAPs) and its Reports on the Observance of 
Standards and Codes (ROSCs). FSB member 
countries have committed to undergo a FSAP 
review once every five years, followed by a vol -
untary FSB peer review within the subsequent 
two years based on the FSAP recommenda -
tions. The objective of the reviews is to share 
lessons and experiences, and – as far as pos -
sible – identify common behavioural principles 
(best practices). The FSB has already completed 
peer reviews on Mexico (in 2010), Italy, Spain, Australia (in 2011), Canada, Switzerland (in 
2012), as well as on South Africa, the United 
States and the United Kingdom (in 2013). The 
final report of the current peer review on Ger -
many is due to be presented in early 2014.
Additionally, the FSB is also engaged in dia -
logue and calls for action to ensure the applica -
tion of international standards in countries out -
side the G20. In this context, the FSB has initi -
ated a procedure that initially covers non- FSB- 
member jurisdictions that it regards as 
important to the international financial system. 
In this process, the FSB draws upon studies by 
the IMF and the World Bank, such as the RO -
SCs. Moreover, the FSB has compiled a list of 
measures to promote adherence and cooper -
ation, which not only features incentives for 
cooperative action but also a public list of non- 
cooperative jurisdictions.
Outlook
International cooperation in financial sector 
issues has become broader and more intensive 
since the establishment of the FSF in 1999. On 
the one hand, this reflects the generally in -
creased importance of the financial sector in 
economic developments. On the other hand, it 
also represents an appropriate response to the 
defining experience of the global financial crisis 
that broke out in 2007. Closer cooperation in 
this area extends to the ongoing monitoring 
and assessment of developments in the finan -
cial sector and to regulatory policy, which has 
now gone significantly beyond the develop -
ment and application of key standards. The FSB 
has placed this international cooperation on a 
sound institutional footing, which has proven 
to be very effective thus far.
The latest reforms have firmly established the 
FSB’s position within the framework of inter -
national institutions. Its revised mandate under -FSB promotes 
the application of international standards

lines the FSB’s role, as legitimised by the G20, 
as a key link between the regulatory and polit -
ical level. Its strengthened position, however, is 
not to the detriment of other bodies or institu -
tions active in this area. Given that the FSB’s 
decisions and recommendations are not legally 
binding, political support from the G20 remains 
crucial to the body’s success – especially as the 
FSB’s task of reviewing the implementation of 
internationally agreed reforms is becoming in -
creasingly important.
As the global financial system continues to 
change, the framework of the bodies and insti -tutions concerned with international financial 
stability policy will also continue to develop. 
Now that the FSB has been established as a 
separate legal entity, the foundations have 
been laid for a possible further increase in its 
importance and responsibilities in the future. If 
there are further changes to the FSB’s role in 
the future, which is conceivable, it will be es -
sential that the FSB maintains its unique feature 
of cooperation across national borders, sectors 
and institutions and does not compromise its 
efficient and goal- oriented way of working.… and lay the 
foundations for possible further development in the futureDeutsche Bundesbank
