5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Economy as a wholeThe stabilising of the economy as a whole,
which had become apparent towards the endof 2001, led into a slight recovery in the firstquarter of this year. After adjustment for sea-sonal and working-day variations, there wasa quarter-on-quarter increase of 0.2% in realgross domestic product (GDP). Adjusted forvariations in the number of working days,however, the figure – which had matched theprevious year’s level in the final quarter of2001 – was, for the first time, slightly down(by 0.2%) on the year. The significantly small-er number of working days this year than inthe comparable period of 2001 meant thatthere was, in fact, a decline of 1.2% incalendar-month terms.
The upturn in the first quarter was not broad-
based, with the main stimulus coming fromexports, which benefited rapidly from the in-cipient revival of the global economy. By con-trast, domestic end demand still tended to beweak overall. Especially in the case of con-sumer durables, households demonstrated adistinct reluctance to buy and continued tocut back their consumption in real terms.There was also a further reduction in invest-ment in machinery and equipment, whichwas more than one-tenth down on the yearin working-day-adjusted terms. The down-ward trend in construction investment record-ed up to the end of 2001 did not continue,however. The fact that stocks were consider-ably reduced in the first quarter of 2002,GDP in Q1

6which was also reflected by a perceptible de-
cline in imports, had an adverse impact.
IndustryIn industry, the subdued upturn of the past
few months continued in early spring. In sea-sonally adjusted terms, the volume of ordersreceived in April was, in fact, much higherthan in March. The seasonally adjusted figuredoes overstate the movement in business ac-tivity, however, since the start of the Easterholidays had fallen in March. For that reason,it is advisable to combine the months ofMarch and April when analysing how theeconomy has developed over the short term.
Seasonally adjusted and at constant prices,
demand for German industrial products andservices in the two-month period of April and
March rose by
12% compared with January
and February. In comparison with the averageof the autumn months of 2001, the increaseamounted to 1
12%. This also meant a reduc-
tion in the year-on-year decline from -5% inJanuary and February to -1% in March andApril. The recovery in the orders situation wassustained by the improved international envir-onment. There was a 2
12% increase in de-
mand from abroad compared with the twopreceding months, with the year-on-year riseamounting to 4
34%. Despite a certain revival
in April, domestic business activity lagged sig-nificantly behind this, with the volume ofdomestic orders in the two months under re-view being, on average, 1
12% down on the
start of the year. The year-on-year fall nar-rowed only marginally from 6
14%t o534%.
According to the provisional figures, the
month-on-month rise in seasonally adjustedindustrial output was no more than moderatein April. On an average of April and May,there was a
14% increase compared with
January and February. The year-on-year falldecreased from 5
12% in the first two months
of the year to 312% in April and May.
ConstructionIn March (more recent data are unavailable at
present), the volume of construction ordersshowed a sharp seasonally adjusted rise onthe preceding months owing to the place-ment of one major order for a commercialbuilding project. Demand for housing con-struction work persisted at a low level andpublic contractors reduced their orders fol-Real GDP

months of the year. Year-on-year growth was5
34%, due mainly to the large order men-
tioned above.
Seasonally adjusted construction sector out-
put fell sharply in the two-month period ofMarch and April, compared with no morethan a slight decline early in the year. Despitethis, there was a year-on-year increase of1
12%. While output in overground construc-
tion was 114% down on the year, output in
surface and underground construction wasup by almost 6%.
Labour marketIn early spring, the labour market was still
feeling the impact of the economic slow-down. Although the number of persons regis-tered as unemployed fell below four millionin May for the first time this year, there wasa seasonally adjusted increase of 60,000 to4.04 million compared with April. This was226,000 persons more than a year before. Ascalculated by the Federal Labour Office, theunemployment rate rose seasonally adjustedfrom 9.6% to 9.7%. The standardised ratewent up from 8.1% to 8.3%.
In the preceding four months taken together,
unemployment had increased by no morethan 40,000 persons in seasonally adjustedterms. This was due in large part to thelabour market policy reform measures intro-duced under the new Job-AQTIV-Gesetz.

8re-registered in May and are now included
again in the official statistics. Moreover, theparticularly large number of public holidays inMay and the pay disputes in some sectorsmay have had an adverse impact on enter-prises’ willingness to recruit new staff.
According to Federal Labour Office data, the
recorded fall of 45,000 to 200,000 in the fig-ures for persons on short-time work in Maywas mainly due to firms returning to full-timework. This may be taken as an initial, albeitweak indication of a gradual improvement onthe labour market.
According to the provisional figures of the of-
ficial statistics, there was a further slight sea-sonally adjusted decline in employment inMarch (more recent data are unavailable atpresent). This was 152,000 persons fewerthan in the same month of 2001, correspond-ing to a fall of 0.4%. The shedding of jobscontinued in both industry and construction.
PricesOwing to cheaper energy and food, con-
sumer prices showed a slight seasonally ad-justed fall in May. The year-on-year rate ofprice increase went down from 1.6% in Aprilto 1.1%, compared with a figure of 2.1%early in the year. In addition to current pricedevelopments becoming calmer, the mainreason for this reduction in the annual rate isthe gradual unwinding of the sharp price in-creases in energy and food prices in the firsthalf of 2001. New upward pressure on pricescame from the services sector, however. Forthe first time since mid-1996, prices fortelecommunications services were up over
12 months. Although prices for local callswere lowered, the basic telephone rentalcharges were increased.
Crude oil prices went back down again some-
what on the international commodities mar-kets, even though they remained at a highlevel compared with the start of the year. Onan average of May, a price of just underUS$26 was recorded for a barrel of North SeaBrent, ie around US$6 more than in January.The fact that the euro has appreciatedagainst the US dollar of late had a price-dampening impact for consumers in Europe.
Seasonally adjusted, there was no further in-
crease in import prices in April. The year-on-year rate increased to -2.8%. Although pricesfor imported energy in April were higher thanin the preceding months, they were morethan 11% down on the year. At the end ofthe period under review, prices for importedagricultural products were declining, after ex-ceptionally unfavourable weather conditionsin a number of countries in southern Europehad led to very sharp increases early in theyear. The domestic selling prices of Germanindustrial products showed a marked season-ally adjusted fall in April, with the year-on-year decline widening to 0.8%. Excluding en-ergy, producer prices increased slightly, how-ever, and were 0.2% up on the year.

Indebtedness of central, state and local
government
In April the indebtedness of central, state and
local government rose by 30.8 billion. This
rise was far smaller than that of March(+38.1 billion). This was due to the develop-
ment of central government debt (includingits assumed joint responsibility of the debt, inparticular, of the Redemption Fund for In-herited Liabilities), which declined by 37.6 bil-
lion, mainly because of the distribution of theBundesbank profit. While central governmentsharply reduced its money market indebted-ness by 39.9 billion, it drew on the capital
market to the amount of 32.3 billion net.
31.8 billion of the topping-up of the ten-year
Federal Bond (Bund) issue of January this yearaccrued to central government itself. In all,however, the joint issue raised 34.7 billion, of
which 32.9 billion was forwarded to the spe-
cial funds. The March issue of Federal Treas-ury notes (Schätze) was likewise topped up(34.4 billion). Including market smoothing
operations, the outstanding amount of thesesecurities rose by 34.9 billion. By contrast,
there was a (temporary) decrease in the out-standing amount of Treasury discount paper(Bubills) in April (- 35.3 billion) because this in-
strument is now being issued monthly insteadof quarterly and at half the previous issuevolume.
Net borrowing by state government was sig-
nificant, amounting to 35.5 billion. These re-
sources were raised mainly through the issueof Treasury notes which yielded 34.3 billiongross and 34.1 billion net. The most promin-
ent individual issue was the “Länder-JumboNo 13” launched jointly by seven federalstates with a value of 31.5 billion and a ma-
turity of five years. In addition the state ofBrandenburg launched a bond for 31 billion
with a maturity of seven years while NorthRhine-Westphalia raised 31.2 billion by issu-
ing several variable-rate short-dated Treasurynotes. Furthermore, cash advances rose by31.0 billion. The off-budget special funds like-
wise increased their indebtedness significant-ly in April. The main reason for this was theaforementioned participation in the Bundissue in which (alongside the “GermanUnity” Fund with 30.1 billion) the ERP Special
Fund was the principal co-borrower with32.8 billion. It should be noted in this context
that the ERP Special Fund faced a financingNet borrowing in the market

order to redeem the ERP bond issued in1992. Local government appears to haveagain marginally increased its indebtedness inApril.
Federal Government borrowingAfter making sizeable redemptions in April,
the Federal Government again expanded itsindebtedness by 31.8 billion in May. Its
money market debt decreased by 31.2 billion.
By contrast, the Federal Government drew33.0 billion net on the capital markets.
The most significant individual item of gross
borrowing by central government was a re-plenishing auction of five-year special Federalbonds (Bobls) which brought in 36.3 billion.Compared with the follow-up auction in Feb-
ruary, the Federal Government had to accepta lower selling price, which was, however,largely offset by calculating the accrued inter-est over nine months. The total volume of thecurrent series has now reached the recordamount of 318 billion (including an additional
31.7 billion set aside for market management
operations following the latest reopening ofthe issue). Since an old series with a volumeof36.6 billion matured in mid-May and fur-
ther repurchases were made, the net indebt-edness securitised by this instrument fell by30.5 billion on balance. The monthly issuance
of Bubills raised 34.9 billion. The outstanding
amount of Bubills increased by an identicalvolume because no redemptions had to bemade. The average yield in the May issue ofjust under 3.5% was somewhat higher thanin April. On balance, Bubills were the mostsignificant debt-financing instrument in May.By contrast, the outstanding volume of Bundswas reduced by 31.0 billion in the wake of
market management operations. Federalsavings bonds likewise recorded a furtherdecrease of 30.7 billion on balance.

11came to 315.5 billion, compared with 317.0
billion in March. The slight decline was mainlydue to lower net sales of bank debt securities.Only 33.7 billion worth of foreign bonds were
placed in the German market (previousmonth: 310.4 billion). On balance, these
bonds were denominated entirely in euro. At319.3 billion, the amount raised from sales of
domestic and foreign bonds in April wasroughly one-third below the March level(327.4 billion).
In April, most of the amount raised accrued
to the public sector. At 38.6 billion, net sales
by public borrowers were twice as high as inthe previous month. The Federal Governmentraised 34.5 billion net from sales of its own
debt securities and sold by a tender proced-ure34.8 billion net worth of ten-year Federal
bonds and 34.7 billion net worth of two-year
Federal Treasury notes (Schätze). On balance,sales of five-year special Federal bonds (Bobls)raised 30.2 billion. The outstanding amount
of Federal savings bonds and 30-year bondissues remained unchanged. The Land gov-
ernments increased their bonded debt by33.9 billion net.
In April, credit institutions increased their in-
debtedness in the bond market by only 33.9
billion, compared with 315.6 billion in March.
Other bank bonds, sales of which raised 35.4
billion, were again in the forefront. The out-standing amount of debt securities issued byspecialised credit institutions rose by 30.3 bil-
lion. 31.0 billion net worth of public Pfand-
briefe and 30.9 billion net worth of mortgage
Pfandbriefe were redeemed. In April, 33.0 bil-
lion worth of corporate bonds were sold,after they had been repurchased in the
amount of 32.9 billion in March.
In April, 34.0 billion worth of euro bonds
were issued by non-residents under the lead-management of German institutions. Owingto high redemptions, the outstanding amountof these bonds some of which are still denom-inated in Deutsche Mark, declined by 30.8 bil-
lion.
In April, bonds were purchased mainly by do-
mestic non-banks. They increased their bondportfolio by 311.0 billion. Non-banks invested
primarily in domestic debt securities ( 39.4 bil-
lion). They added 37.0 billion of private
bonds and 32.4 billion of public bonds to
their portfolios. Credit institutions purchasedbonds in the amount of 37.2 billion net, withSales and purchases of bonds

Foreign investors sold private debt instru-ments in the amount of 30.6 billion and in-

Equity marketIn April, issuing activity in the German equity
market continued to be clearly subdued. Port-folios of foreign equities increased by only32.3 billion net, having risen by 35.2 billion in
March. Domestic enterprises placed newshares to a market value of 31.0 billion,
which was less than in the previous month(31.4 billion). In April, 33.3 billion net worth
of domestic and foreign paper was sold in theGerman equity market.
In April, domestic non-banks bought equities
worth 37.8 billion net. On balance, they
added mainly foreign paper to their port-folios. Domestic credit institutions increasedtheir equity portfolios by 32.4 billion. They
purchased 36.4 billion of German equities
and sold foreign equities worth 34.0 billion.
Foreign investors, however, reduced theirportfolios of German shares by 37.0 billion
net. Only portfolio investments were affectedby the decrease.
Investment fund certificatesThe amount raised by domestic investment
funds came to 37.4 billion in April, compared
with only 30.8 billion in March, and focusedon specialised funds ( 36.2 billion). Mixed
funds attracted particular attention ( 33.3 bil-
lion). Share-based funds and bond-basedfunds sold 31.6 billion and 31.2 billion worth
of certificates. 30.1 billion net was invested in
open-end real estate specialised funds. InApril, 31.2 billion accrued to funds open to
the general public. As in the previous months,investments in open-end real estate fundspredominated, at 31.1 billion. Money market
funds, pension investment mutual funds(Altersvorsorgefonds ) and mixed funds at-
tracted inflows of 30.1 billion each. Share-
based funds, however, repurchased 30.1 bil-
lion of certificates. The capital invested inbond-based funds and funds of funds re-mained virtually unchanged. In April, sales offoreign investment fund certificates yielded31.4 billion. The total amount raised from
sales of domestic and foreign investmentfund certificates thus came to 38.8 billion.
As in the previous months, investment fund
certificates were bought mainly by domesticnon-banks ( 37.7 billion), which predominant-
ly favoured domestic fund certificates. Creditinstitutions’ holdings of investment fund cer-tificates increased by 31.5 billion. By contrast,
non-residents sold certificates of Germanfunds totalling 30.4 billion net.

13smaller trade surplus and a larger deficit on
current invisible transactions were contribu-tory factors.
According to calculations by the Federal Stat-
istical Office, trade in goods produced a sur-plus of 39.3 billion in April compared with
one of 311.7 billion in March. This was due
primarily to the sharp increase in imports;compared with their rapid growth in the pre-vious month, exports, by contrast, rose lessstrongly in April. The trade balance also de-teriorated after the elimination of seasonalfactors, falling to 39.1 billion compared with
311.2 billion in the previous month. If the last
three months (February to April) are taken to-gether, however, there is a parallel movement(of +2
12%) in both exports and imports com-
pared with the previous period (November toJanuary).
The other current transactions in April ran a
deficit that was somewhat greater than inMarch ( 35.5 billion compared with 34.3 bil-
lion). This was due mainly to the lower netfactor income emanating from abroad ( 30.2
billion in April compared with 31.7 billion in
March). In the case of current transfers netpayments to non-residents rose by 30.3 bil-
lion to 33.0 billion while in cross-border ser-
vices the deficit declined by 30.5 billion to
32.8 billion.
Net capital exports arising from cross-border
portfolio investment again increased in April(311.6 billion); in the previous month they
had declined substantially ( 31.5 billion). The
main reason for this was the sharp reductionwhich foreign investors made in their port-Major items of the balance

14folio positions on the German market in April
(36.3 billion). Investment in shares ( 37.0 bil-
lion) and money market paper ( 34.7 billion)
was particularly affected by this; however,non-residents also resold net amounts of in-vestment fund certificates ( 30.4 billion) and
private bonds ( 30.1 billion). On the other
hand, there was fairly heavy demand fromforeign buyers for public bonds and notes(35.8 billion) in April. In the period under re-
view German residents invested 35.3 billion
net in foreign securities; that was just under34 billion less than in March. Their interest
continued to be focused primarily on euro-denominated bonds ( 34.2 billion) and invest-
ment fund certificates ( 31.4 billion). Small
amounts of funds also flowed into foreignmoney market paper ( 30.9 billion) and shares
(30.2 billion) whereas there were net sales of
foreign currency bonds ( 31.3 billion).
In contrast to portfolio investment, direct in-
vestment resulted in net capital imports ( 37.7
billion) in April. Foreign proprietors providedtheir branches domiciled in Germany with34.6 billion in investable funds, almost exclu-sively in the form of short-term credits. Fur-
thermore, German enterprises recorded thereturn of funds from their subsidiaries domi-ciled abroad ( 33.1 billion). These were essen-
tially long-term credits which had been grant-ed to affiliated enterprises abroad and whichwere now being repaid.
There were net exports of funds through the
non-securitised credit transactions of non-banks ( 314.7 billion). Enterprises and individ-
uals, in particular, invested substantial fundsabroad ( 315.7 billion net), mainly by building
up their short-term balances with foreignbanks. By contrast, general government im-ported 31.0 billion net. 312.9 billion accrued
to the German banking system, whose ac-counts reflect, as it were, the remaining re-corded external payments. The net externalposition of the German credit institutions de-clined whereas the assets position of the Bun-desbank increased, essentially in connectionwith the payments system TARGET.

15Overall financial
flows in 2001The weak overall growth of the Ger-
man economy also had a marked im-pact on financial flows last year. Invest-ment in the real economy was reinedback across a broad front. The supplyof financing resources in the form ofsavings likewise declined, albeit not assharply as the domestic demand forfinancing. In 2001 – for the first timesince the reunification of Germany –there was no net inflow of funds fromthe rest of the world. The contractionof financial transactions was evenmore pronounced. Share purchasesand equity financing, in particular,were well down on the precedingyears, not least owing to the unfavour-able stock market trend. Cross-borderactivities, which had increased continu-ously in the second half of the 1990s,likewise declined in 2001. Thankslargely to the net financial flows of thehousehold sector, Germany was ablelast year to resume its traditional roleof being a net capital exporter. A keyreason for this was that households’borrowing declined significantly. Theirliabilities had grown steeply duringthe 1990s, however. An internationalcomparison shows that household in-debtedness in some other industrialnations was much greater and alsogrew much faster than in Germany.

16Domestic acquisition of non-financial
assets
Net investment by the domestic sectors in
fixed assets and inventories in 2001 totalled3100 billion or just under 6% of the national
disposable income. This was around one-thirdless than in 2000, when investment had beenat a comparatively high level. The size of thefall is underlined by the fact that last year’sfigure fell well short of the lowest totalsreached during the 1990s in both absoluteand relative terms.
The sharp decline in investment was not con-
centrated on one sector but rather wasrecorded across the board. The investmentrestraint was particularly evident in the caseof producing enterprises and households.Whereas such falls in investment habituallyoccur among non-financial corporations andquasi-corporations in response to a worsen-ing of the underlying business climate, house-holds had not shown such marked invest-ment restraint since the early 1990s. Last yearhouseholds invested almost one-fifth lessthan in 2000. This drop was due primarily toa significant contraction in housing construc-tion. Households’ share in overall fixed capitalformation nevertheless increased in 2001 toover one-half as the fall in net investmentby producing enterprises last year was evenmore pronounced than that of households.At not quite 340 billion, the creation of new
capital stock was little more than half of thefigure recorded in 2000. In nominal terms thiswas the lowest volume of fixed capital forma-tion registered since 1993, a year marked bya very slack cyclical momentum.The general government sector, too, contrib-
uted to the decline in overall investment lastyear. It invested 31
12billion or two-fifths less
than in 2000. In net terms the public invest-ment budget was only one-seventh of thelevels seen in the first half of the 1990s,which had been substantially boosted by therenewal of the east German infrastructure inthe wake of reunification.
National supply of savings
Domestic saving likewise slowed in 2001
compared with 2000. The level of savingsamounted to around 3110 billion or 6
12%o f
national disposable income, which was thelowest level seen during the past ten years. Incontrast to the investment trend, however,the saving trend presented a mixed picture.The low overall level of savings was primarilyattributable to the general government sec-tor. Its dissaving, excluding net capital trans-fers made, increased substantially by over330 billion to 355 billion. This deterioration
was due chiefly to the large revenue shortfallsensuing from the first phase of the tax re-form, although the less favourable economicdevelopment also played a role.
Although the enterprise sector, like general
government, registered negative savings in2001, it at least recorded a somewhat betterresult than in the previous year. For one thing,the net capital transfers received by non-financial corporations were higher than be-fore at 315 billion; for another thing, retained
profits (as defined in the national accounts)showed a slightly smaller deficit. The upshotLower

18of this was that the enterprise sector con-
cluded last year with a negative savings ac-count of - 310 billion. The household sector,
by contrast, lifted its savings total year onyear by approximately 310 billion. Inclusive of
the net capital transfers received amountingto320 billion, households generated a sur-
plus supply of funds totalling almost 3160 bil-
lion. This was the highest figure for manyyears.
Basic pattern of financial balances and
flows
In the light of the investment and saving
trends outlined above, Germany noticeablyimproved its financial position vis-à-vis therest of the world last year. It recorded netlending of 310 billion or
12% of the dispos-
able income of the domestic sectors. This wasthe first financial surplus generated since re-unification. Prior to that, however, financialsurpluses had been the norm.
At just short of 360 billion, the general gov-
ernment sector had the largest external fi-nancing requirement in 2001. In 2000 it hadbeen a net lender to the other sectors thanksto the one-off proceeds from auctioning theUMTS licences. Non-financial corporationsformed the second traditional group of netborrowers. In contrast to the general govern-ment sector, however, the enterprise sectorrecorded a much smaller deficit than in 2000.This was due not so much to the steep dropin the amount firms invested last year as totheir massive borrowing requirement in 2000associated with the purchase of the UMTSlicences. Between them, the general govern-
ment and enterprise sectors registered a com-bined funding shortfall of over 3100 billion or
6% of national disposable income. This high-er financing requirement was covered almostcompletely by the record financial surplus ac-cumulated by German households.
Given the subdued growth of the real eco-
nomic net variables investment and saving,the financial flows likewise contracted con-siderably in 2001 compared with the preced-ing years. That applies to cross-border trans-actions, too. The volume of financial assetsacquired by the non-financial sectors fellby more than one-third. External financingplummeted by as much as one-half to just11% of national disposable income, the low-est percentage recorded since 1991. Onemajor reason for this was the relatively lowrecourse of non-financial corporations toexternal resources. Firms’ external fundingneeds were less than half as large as in 2000(partly on account of baseline effects) andonly marginally exceeded the 1998 figure. Onthe positive side, households progressed fur-ther in 2001. Unlike the enterprise and gen-eral government sectors, they managed to in-crease their acquisition of financial assets andhence their share of financial asset formationby all non-financial sectors. Even so, the larg-est share was once again held by the enter-prise sector; it has been the main driver offinancial asset formation since 1998 aftersharply stepping up its external growththrough equity acquisitions.
The past year saw something of a change of
trend compared with the preceding years.

20Whereas between 1998 and 2000 there had
been a marked trend in investment towardsdirect equity acquisitions and in financing to-wards the procurement of resources via thestock market (both featuring intensive inter-national involvement), this process largelycame to an end in 2001 in the context of theongoing share price corrections and thegreatly increased nervousness on the stockexchanges. Financial intermediaries, especial-ly banks, did not lose any more ground onbalance. This was closely associated with pro-nounced shifts in the maturity of financialflows. This effect was particularly marked inthe case of financial asset formation. Where-as longer-term investments (especially in theform of equity) showed a much smaller in-crease than in 2000, short-term financialasset formation more than doubled in thewake of the rising preference for liquidity, al-beit from a relatively low level. In particular,short-term investment with banks, a categorywhich includes money market funds, wasstepped up noticeably. Both short and longer-term external financing vehicles met with afar smaller demand in view of the generalinvestment restraint, depletion of inventoriesand depressed turnover. Nevertheless, theGerman economy continued to show a biastowards long-term financing in 2001.
Firms’ uses and sources of funds
Whereas in 2000 firms’ demand for financial
resources had been massively inflated by ex-ceptional factors, in 2001 their combined ac-quisition of non-financial and financial assetsdeclined steeply by almost one-quarter. As aresult, their asset formation was on a par
with the level in 1998-99, although that hadfar surpassed the preceding multi-year aver-age. The period from 1998 to 2000 had beencharacterised throughout by the very vigor-ous internal and external growth of com-panies on the back of the increasingly bullishmood of the stock markets. Against thatbackground, the exceptionally high demandfor capital in 2000 had resulted from the pur-chase of UMTS licences and, specifically, fromthe acquisition of the German subsidiary ofa British enterprise in the wake of a cross-border take-over in the telecommunicationssector. Hence the decline in 2001 may beseen to some extent as a return to normal, es-pecially with regard to the financial compon-ent of the uses to which the funds were put.
Even gross capital formation by firms, which
accounted for about three-fifths of all ex-penditure on non-financial and financialassets last year, fell by over one-tenth to notquite 3220 billion. This decrease was caused
principally by destocking, after inventorieshad been sharply increased in 2000. In add-ition, construction shrank perceptibly; on bal-ance it declined by an even greater marginthan the procurement of machinery andequipment.
In connection with the slackening inter-
national business momentum and the weakstate of the stock markets, those financialasset items which had previously grown dy-namically developed moderately in 2001. Thiswas especially true of equity purchases andof lending to non-residents. Both activities,which also partly mirror a global corporate

22strategy, plummeted last year. Thus net lend-
ing to foreign enterprises plunged to zeroafter reaching a multi-year record level ofover 350 billion in 2000. Such a minuscule
level of cross-border lending and borrowingwas last seen in the recession of 1992-93.Firms’ willingness to acquire equity stakes inother enterprises also abated drastically lastyear; in fact, the year-on-year fall in equity ac-quisitions was even greater than in the caseof lending. This holds even if the average of
1998 to 2000 is taken as the reference periodrather than the year 2000 with its abnormallyinflated development. The acquisition of cor-porate shareholdings in 2001 amounted tobarely one-third of the average recorded dur-ing that three-year period.
Alongside these contractions, some financial
asset items showed an expansionary ten-dency, if only on a small scale. For example,the loans granted by enterprises to other do-mestic sectors expanded slightly after show-ing a sharp downturn in the two precedingyears. Time deposits also increased – for thefirst time since 1998. The same aim of tem-porarily parking liquid resources presumablyalso motivated the sizeable purchases ofmoney market paper.
Last year enterprises substantially raised their
share of internal financing in relation to theiroverall use of funds to just short of 50%,after the ratio had fallen in 2000 to one-third,the lowest level since the early 1990s. Besidesa smaller financing requirement, three factorscontributed to this optically favourable devel-opment. Firstly, firms’ consumption of fixedcapital increased further owing to their exten-sive capital formation in the preceding years.Secondly, their internally generated financialresources were boosted by increased capitaltransfers. Thirdly, the negative total of re-tained profits was not as large as the deficitin 2000, despite relatively large current losses.This is presumably due primarily to the factthat in 2000, for tax reasons, retained incomehad been released on a large scale ready fordisbursement in 2001.%

23By contrast, the amount of external resources
raised fell by about half in 2001 to the levelof 1998. Two of the financing sources whichremained strong were the markets for bondsand money market paper (although they areonly of minor importance for firms in Ger-many) and bank lending. Although credit pro-curement through banks receded slightly, itnonetheless made up almost one-quarter ofall external financing last year compared withlittle more than one-tenth in 2000. Moreover,bank credit exceeded borrowing from othersources for the first time since 1998.
Borrowing from non-banks declined substan-
tially compared with 2000. This applies espe-cially to foreign non-bank lenders; in 2000they had provided financial loans and tradecredits to German firms totalling almost 3160
billion, whereas last year they supplied onlyabout one-quarter of that figure. This add-itionally highlights the extent to which thefinancial flows of globally active enterpriseswere affected by the worldwide slowdownon the goods and financial markets. Thesame can be said of equity financing. It fell byhalf compared with 2000, although it wasstill greater than it had been in the precedingyears. Nearly two-thirds – a greater sharethan in the previous two years – was account-ed for by share issues, a development whichat first appears surprising given the lacklustrestate of the stock market last year. This in-crease was fuelled, in particular, by the acqui-sition of a US telecommunications companyby a German group. The foreign shareholdersreceived payment in the form of domestic se-curities and the transaction was booked as anexport of capital. If this exceptional factor isdisregarded, the level of share sales would
have been much lower.
Households’ investment and borrowing
behaviour
As in the case of the non-financial corpor-
ations, the volume of resources raised andused by households decreased in 2001 al-though it by no means slumped, as it did inthe enterprise sector; at 5%, the decreasewas actually far smaller than in 2000. Further-more, two key aggregates, namely savingand financial asset formation, expanded. Bycontrast, households’ acquisition of non-financial assets and their borrowing require-ments, which are closely connected with theformer, declined.
As stated above, households’ total amount
of available funds fell only marginally in 2001to3180 billion, although this was more than
one-fifth less than the previous highest totalrecorded in 1994. This marked declineis due to the sharp fall in households’ de-mand for credit. Last year borrowing frombanks and insurance corporations was barelyone-quarter of the corresponding total in1994, when their incurrence of liabilities hadreached a peak. Despite the relatively favour-able interest rate level, new borrowing byhouseholds in 2001 slumped to only half thevolume recorded in 2000, when householdborrowing had already dropped below itsmulti-year average. One reason why privatecitizens took up fewer loans last year, how-ever, was that their own investable fundswere far higher than in the mid-1990s. They

24amounted to 3160 billion, which was a rise
of nearly 20% compared with 1994. This waspartly attributable to the large net capitaltransfers received which, at 320 billion, were
five times as high as in 1994. A significantfraction of the transfers was made up of thehome buyers’ grant, which was introduced in1996 in place of the previous tax-deductibleallowance. In addition, household savings lastyear totalled almost 3140 billion, which was
the highest absolute figure recorded since thebeginning of the 1990s.
The saving ratio of 10.2% of households’ dis-
posable income was still considerably lowerthan it had been in the early 1990s, however.Nevertheless, it increased in 2001 for the firsttime in a long while. This can be explainedpartly by the tax reforms introduced on1 January 2001 and partly by the waningconsumer confidence as the year progressed.It is also possible that the intensive public de-bate about the need for greater private old-age provision may have prompted familiesand individuals to set aside more funds forthis purpose.
Households’ weak demand for credit in 2001
was closely connected with the decline intheir acquisition of non-financial assets,which was nearly one-fifth lower than in2000. As a result, households’ net investmentratio fell to a record low of 4
12% of their dis-
posable income; in the first half of the 1990sit had averaged 6
12%. This decrease was
caused first and foremost by reduced interestin purchasing dwellings, which accounted forsome four-fifths of the sector’s aggregate in-vestment. The decrease in construction activ-ity was even more pronounced than in 2000.
Purchases of machinery and equipment byself-employed persons and sole proprietorslikewise declined; such purchases had risenappreciably in the preceding years. They lastfell during the recession of 1992-93.
By contrast, the volume of financial assets ac-
quired by households expanded a little lastyear; but, at 3120 billion, it was still distinctly
below the average figure in the 1990s.Owing to the sluggish momentum on thestock market, some forms of investment ex-perienced a reversal of their previous multi-year trend. In particular, the demand for trad-itional bank products climbed steeply againor at least no longer contracted, whereashigher-risk investments proved significantlyless attractive.
For example, households’ willingness to buy
equities directly or indirectly or to keep themin their portfolios decreased substantially in2001. Whereas in the two years prior to thathouseholds had made direct share purchasesworth more than 330 billion, they sold shares
in roughly the same amount on balance in2001. This was the first time that they hadoffloaded equities on such a scale. Indirectshare purchases, too, slumped substantiallylast year. Measured by the sales volume ofshare-based mutual funds, indirect share pur-chases amounted to only one-eighth of thecorresponding total in 2000. Purchases ofshares of money market funds and open-endreal estate funds constituted something of acounterweight, however, with the result thathouseholds bought investment fund certifi-cates worth over 350 billion net, which was

26only a little less than in 2000. Thanks to their
ability to offer investors a choice of invest-ment vehicles with different risk profiles, mu-tual funds have proved a fairly stable invest-ment segment on the whole. They accountedfor around two-fifths of households’ total ac-quisition of financial assets in 2001; this wastwice as much as the average during the1990s.
Owing to tax incentives and the relatively
high degree of security provided, Germanhouseholds have for many years invested asignificant part of their investable funds in in-surance corporations, which then reinvestthese inflowing funds in various “instru-ments”. To the extent that insurance com-panies place their collected premiums inshares or share-based funds, however, thepart of profit-sharing attributed to insurees is
also subject to a certain risk, even though in-surance corporations overall still have consid-erable hidden reserves which they can mobil-ise in order to offset short-term fluctuationsin their income. In 2001 households toppedup their investments held with insurance cor-porations by not quite 360 billion following a
year-on-year fall in 2000. One explanation ofthat fall was that people were waiting untilthe details of the imminent introduction ofprivate pension plans (PPP) had been settled.That uncertainty has since been allayed ascertified PPP products eligible for governmentsubsidies have been available since 2002.
The poor performance of shares gave a par-
ticular fillip to saving with banks. While it isquite normal for the amount of short-term in-vestments placed with banks to fluctuatesubstantially, the injection of nearly 330 bil-
lion in 2001, coming after the withdrawal ofa similar amount in 2000, was unusual. Thisbig swing was attributable above all to sav-ings deposits, the volume of which stabilisedfollowing their large-scale liquidation a yearearlier. In addition, households increased theirtime deposits by the very large amount of al-most 320 billion. It is likely that households
chose to place their surplus funds in time de-posits as a temporary interest-earning invest-ment vehicle with a view to switching quicklyto equities as soon as share prices pick up.

27Households’ financial assets and
indebtedness
The weak share price trend in 2001 also
severely influenced households’ financialassets development. Whereas per se transac-
tions added 3120 billion to stocks, the latter,
measured at market prices, stagnated on ac-count of the lower valuation of households’equity portfolios. One direct consequence ofthis was that bank deposits reached aboutthe same level last year as equity, bonds andmutual fund shares combined. In the preced-ing couple of years much more money hadbeen invested in securities than in conven-tional bank products. If 2000 and 2001 aretaken together, the acquisition of financialassets amounted to 3240 billion, whereas the
stock of financial assets grew by less than380 billion. This equals a valuation-induced
“wealth reduction” of 3160 billion, or almost
70% of financial asset acquisition, in thespace of just two years. This unfavourable de-velopment is also reflected in the fact thatover the same period the ratio of financialassets to disposable income fell by as muchas 10 percentage points.
The decline in households’ net financial assets
was smaller, however, since their liabilitiesgrew only moderately, as described in an earl-ier section of this article. The expansion oftheir financial debt by little more than 320 bil-
lion in 2001 was the lowest increase in a longtime; consequently, the ratio of their out-standing debt to disposable income narrowedto just over 110%. Despite this recent decel-eration, however, indebtedness grew quitefast between 1991 and 2001 as a whole.Households’ debt virtually doubled during
that period, increasing at an annual averagerate of 6
12% and thereby easily outpacing
the growth of disposable income. This hasrecently been interpreted as constituting ahandicap for private consumption and hencefor real growth in Germany. Whether macro-economic problems can be deduced solelyfrom the level and rate of increase in house-holds’ debt is questionable, however. A moredifferentiated assessment of their liabilities isrequired. In particular, the maturity pattern ofhousehold loans and their purpose need tobe taken into account before possible nega-tive macroeconomic implications can be iden-tified. Furthermore, it is useful to compareGerman households with their counterpartsin other countries so as to place domestic de-velopments in an international context.
Regarding the maturity pattern of liabilities,
which plays a major role not least in connec-tion with changes in central bank interestrates, the debt of German households waspredominantly longer-term throughout theten-year period under review. In 2001 lessthan one-tenth of all liabilities incurred byhouseholds had a maturity of less than oneyear. At the beginning of the 1990s the per-centage had been a little higher. Outstandingshort-term credit – consisting mainly of bankloans – grew by one-fifth from 1991 to 2001,ie far more slowly than aggregate borrowing.This means that the expansion of overallcredit was driven by longer-term loans withinterest rates locked in for longer periods.These increased by over 90%.Stagnating level

28If household borrowing is broken down by
purpose, it emerges – notwithstanding all thecurrent statistical shortcomings – that hous-ing loans clearly predominate. As in the past,consumer loans used for purchasing durableconsumer goods are of far less significance. In2001 they accounted for little more thanone-tenth of all borrowing. They grew byaround 50% over the period under review,which was far less than the rate of expansionof household liabilities as a whole. This isequally true of the third component, namelyloans to sole proprietors. Their significancewithin overall household borrowing is muchgreater than that of consumer loans, how-ever. This mirrors the major importance ofself-employed entrepreneurs and small busi-nesses within Germany’s corporate land-scape: it is estimated that they account foraround two-thirds of all German enterprisesand for roughly one-sixth of corporate turn-over.
The liabilities incurred by households in con-
nection with housebuilding in 2001 made upalmost two-thirds of their total outstandingdebt. Thus for many families and individualshousing construction is the decisive motivefor resorting to external finance. Followingreunification there was a residential construc-tion boom in eastern Germany which wasparticularly marked in the early 1990s, al-though the level of construction activity re-mained high until the end of that decade. It istherefore not surprising that housing loans,which in the vast majority of cases are longer-term loans, recorded high average growththroughout the period under review. It wasnot until 2000 that the construction ofowner-occupied housing began to decelerate
noticeably, and this was also reflected in theincurrence of liabilities. On the whole, hous-ing loans doubled between 1991 and 2001.
The national financial accounts data, which
have to be reported each year to Eurostat,and are compiled according to ESA ’95, canbe used to make an international comparisonof household indebtedness in the EU memberstates. This ensures that the household sectoris more or less uniformly defined. Unfortu-nately, the corresponding time series are onlyavailable for the period 1995 to 2000; thismeans that the data for 2001 have to be cal-culated from national sources. Using thestandard international practice of measuringhousehold liabilities in relation to a country’snational output, Germany was far from hav-ing the highest debt ratio within the EU lastyear. Four countries (Denmark, the Nether-lands, Portugal and the United Kingdom) dis-played a distinctly higher degree of indebted-ness. Italy and Finland had by far the smallestdebt ratios at around 30% of GDP . Thisspread may be due to country-specific fac-tors, such as cultural differences in the prefer-ence for home ownership, the amount ofequity which banks require from borrowers asa down payment, the respective levels of con-struction costs and property prices as well astax-related factors.
Again, with regard to the evolution of house-
hold indebtedness over the period from 1995to 2001, Germany is in the middle of theleague table, with an increase of 10 percent-age points in the national debt ratio. The larg-est rise was recorded by Portugal, where in-

30debtedness more than doubled in absolute
terms; the corresponding debt-to-GDP ratiosurged by almost 40 percentage points. Spainand the Netherlands come some way behind,although the rise in their debt ratio was alsowell above average. The available informationsuggests that in most EU partner states, as inGermany, the rise in household borrowingwas largely related to housing construction.In the United Kingdom, by contrast, con-sumer credit accelerated disproportionatelyof late. Aggregate liabilities of UK householdsexpanded by half between 1995 and 2001.However, the concurrent rise of just over5 percentage points in the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio was rather moderate, partly as a re-sult of relatively high nominal GDP growth.Bilateral comparisons of German and US in-
debtedness, which have frequently beenmade during the past few months, are con-fronted with the statistical problem that thehousehold sector is defined differently in thetwo countries. Thus the definition of “house-holds” used in the United States does not in-clude sole proprietorships as in Germany andtherefore understates the level of liabilities incomparison with the European sectoral classi-fication. Conversely, the alternative US con-cept of the “personal sector” overstates bor-rowing since it includes not only sole propri-etors but also partnerships. According to ESA’95, the latter are assignable to the groupof non-financial corporations. Between 1995and 2001 the United States witnessed amarked rise in indebtedness which was morepronounced than in Germany – irrespectiveof the method of computation. If the broaderUS definition (“personal sector”) is comparedwith German households using the customar-ily defined figures, or if the incurrence of li-abilities by German households is adjusted forloans to sole proprietors (in line with thenarrow US definition of “households”), thedebt-to-GDP ratio of US households was dis-tinctly higher than that of German house-holds.
If the analysis is confined to the euro area,
the aggregate debt ratio of households roseby not quite10 percentage points during theperiod from 1995 to 2001. Most of this riseoccurred in the second half of the 1990s,since which time the rate of debt growth hasslowed in nearly all euro-area countries, insome cases quite perceptibly. The increase inindebtedness was attributable above all to a

31greater demand for housing loans; for the
most part these were loans with a fairly longmaturity and fixed rates of interest. Thismeans that long-term interest rates, notshort-term rates, constitute the principal costcomponent. In recent years long-term interestrates have been much lower on average thanthey were in the first half of the 1990s, andthis, in turn, has played a crucial role in keep-ing households’ interest burden manageabledespite a rising level of indebtedness. Thisowed much to the convergence of interestrates in the wake of the Maastricht processand, subsequently, the monetary policy pur-sued by the Eurosystem. A stability-oriented-monetary policy can keep down inflation ex-pectations and so make an autonomous con-tribution to positively influencing the interestrate level, which is ultimately determined inthe capital market. This also benefits house-holds when they come to build a home.
Moreover, an increase in borrowing for the
purpose of housing construction is to be as-sessed quite differently from a rise in con-sumer credit. For example, the mortgageinterest payments are offset at least in part bythe rent expense that is saved by an owner-occupier or the rent income that accrues tothe letter of a purchased dwelling. A risinginterest payment ratio for households result-ing from growing asset acquisition in theform of dwellings by no means implies a cor-responding contraction of their scope forspending. Furthermore, the acquisition of anasset with an enduring value constitutes tan-
gible collateral for the lender should the debt-or default. This holds, however, only as longas house prices do not rise excessively as this,in turn, will have an expansionary effect onthe demand for credit. No such excessiveproperty price increases are evident for theeuro area as a whole. Although asset pricesare not a focal point of monetary policy, aconsistent stability orientation can contributeto at least dampening such asset price infla-tion and thus to preventing potential distor-tions for households and banks alike as wellas for the economy as a whole.

39The evolution
of accountingstandards for creditinstitutionsAccounting practices in Germany are
undergoing a major change. A newregulation adopted by the EuropeanCommission requires that from 2005 alllisted companies in the EU file at leasttheir consolidated financial statementsusing International Accounting Stand-ards (IAS). The adoption and implemen-tation of this EU regulation are takingplace at a time when events such as thecollapse of US energy trader Enron havecast doubt on the reliability of account-ing practices. All parties involved havecome under fire: accountants, auditors,rating agencies and financial analysts.Even investors have drawn criticism forblithely accepting published corporateprofit figures at face value. Against thisbackground, it is important to carefullyweigh the benefits and disadvantagesof changing over from the tried andtested accounting rules of the GermanCommercial Code, with its emphasis oncreditor protection and capital preser-vation, to IAS rules, which are orientedmore towards investors and capital mar-kets. It is necessary to develop solutionsthat contribute to financial market sta-bility and ensure that reliable pruden-tial risk limitation standards are appliedin a manner that ensures a level playingfield. At present, it would appear in-appropriate to move too hastily to-wards abandoning the compilation ofsingle-entity financial statements ac-cording to German accounting stand-ards or abandoning the instrument ofundisclosed reserves.

40Change in the legislative framework
The last time the legislative framework for
credit institutions’ accounting practiceschanged in Germany was when the Bank Ac-counts Directive
1was translated into German
law by means of the 1991 Bank Accounts Dir-ective Act ( Bankbilanzrichtlinie-Gesetz ) and
the 1992 Accounting Regulation for Banks(Verordnung über die Rechnungslegung der
Kreditinstitute ). At that time, uniform ac-
counting rules for all credit institutions wereincorporated into the Commercial Code anda matching statutory ordinance, although thisdid not fundamentally change accountingpractices. In particular, the formation of un-disclosed reserves through the correspondingexercising of national options, even if in limit-ed form, remained a key aspect in banks’ ac-counting practices.
2However, the fact that
the Bank Accounts Directive permits numer-ous national options has thus far hamperedthe harmonisation of accounting rules in theEuropean Union.
To banking supervisors, the supervised institu-
tions’ annual accounts, drawn up in line withexternal accounting requirements, are a keyfoundation for assessing the institutions’ eco-nomic situation. For that reason, they are alsorequired by law to be audited. The reports onthe audits of the annual accounts by externalauditors or audit associations are an import-ant instrument of prudential supervision inGermany.
Banks’ capital plays a major role in supervi-
sion. The concept of regulatory capital de-fines how much capital is needed to back abank’s counterparty risk and market price
risk. The definition of capital under commer-cial law, or “balance sheet capital”, is close tothat of regulatory capital. However, while theprudential definition of “own funds” is basedon the commercial-law concept of capital, itgoes beyond the definition of the capital tobe reported on the balance sheet. Balancesheet capital always constitutes “core cap-ital” in prudential terms. Changes in the bal-ance sheet which alter the balance sheet cap-ital therefore also simultaneously affect thecapital recognised for prudential purposes.Moreover, changes in core capital also havean impact on the maximum permissible levelof “additional capital”, as the latter may notexceed 100% of core capital.
3
“Balance sheet capital” is a residual conceptarrived at after valuing and matching assets,liabilities and off-balance sheet business. Val-ues shown in the balance sheet are also thestarting point for defining the “risk assets” inthe prudential sense which need to bebacked by capital. That being the case, it isclear that an accurate valuation of assets is akey precondition for prudential risk limitationstandards to function properly.

41The principal information instrument of Ger-
man enterprises is the consolidated financialstatement based on the Commercial Code, ieGerman generally accepted accounting prin-ciples. However, the fact that German com-panies, too, are resorting increasingly to theinternational capital markets has causedmore and more companies active in foreigncapital markets to switch to disclosing infor-mation in their consolidated financial state-ments on the basis of international account-ing standards, which are more familiar tointernational investors than German GAAPbased on the rules of the Commercial Code.
The German parliament reacted to this devel-
opment in 1998 by adopting the Act to Facili-tate International Equity Financing ( Kapital-
aufnahmeerleichterungsgesetz )
4and a sup-
plemental provision in the Corporation Dir-ective Act ( Kapitalgesellschaften- und Co-
Richtlinien-Gesetz ). Listed parent companies
now have the option, in compliance with theEU accounting directives, of compiling theirconsolidated financial statements pursuantto section 292a of the Commercial Code inline with internationally recognised account-ing principles.
5Internationally recognised ac-
counting principles are the International Ac-counting Standards (IAS) elaborated by theInternational Accounting Standards Board(IASB), as well as, on account of their wide-spread international use, the US GenerallyAccepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP)developed by the Financial Accounting Stand-ards Board (FASB) in the United States; theirapplication is mandatory for companies wish-ing to be listed on a US stock exchange. Forinternationally operating credit institutionswhich have undertaken to comply with the
Basel Committee’s capital adequacy stand-ards, consolidated financial statements drawnup according to IAS or US GAAP pursuant tothe exemption option of section 292a of theCommercial Code may also be used as thebasis for calculating regulatory capital. Atpresent two of the 15 internationally operat-ing German credit institutions are making useof this option.
The exemption option granted by section
292a of the Commercial Code is only an in-terim solution, however, and is due to expireat the end of 2004. After that, it is likely thata regulation of the European Parliament andthe Council regarding the use of internationalaccounting standards will enter into force, re-quiring listed companies in the EU to draw upand publish their consolidated financial state-ments according to IAS from 2005. This EUregulation, the draft version of which metwith broad support, was recently adopted. To

national Equity Financing, the German parliament passed
the Act on Corporate Governance and Transparency
(Gesetz zur Kontrolle und Transparenz im Unternehmens-
bereich), 27 April 1998, Federal Law Gazette I, p 786. It
was on this legal basis that the German Accounting
Standards Committee was established; it is a publicly rec-
ognised private German accounting committee whose
job it is to develop generally accepted accounting prin-
ciples for consolidated financial statements, to advise the
Federal Ministry of Justice in drafting bills relating to ac-
counting, and to increase Germany’s influence on the
process of international standardisation, particularly in
the context of the IASB.

envisaged until the end of 2006 for com-panies which only trade in debt securities onregulated capital markets or which alreadyuse other internationally accepted standardsbecause they are listed in a country outsidethe EU. Basically, that relates solely to com-panies which are listed in the United Statesand therefore use US GAAP . Moreover, thedraft regulation gives member states an op-tion of allowing or requiring non-listed parent
companies to compile consolidated financialstatements in accordance with IAS or ofallowing or requiring all companies to drawup single-entity financial statements, too, inline with IAS. The German Commercial Code,IAS and US GAAP are compared in the boxon page 43.
International Accounting Standards (IAS)
The use of internationally uniform and appro-
priate accounting standards is intended to en-hance transparency in the enterprise sectorand promote the stability of the financial sys-tem. IAS is regarded as a crucial instrumentfor harmonising accounting practices world-wide. In October 1998 the G7 finance minis-ters and central bank governors called on theInternational Accounting Standards Commit-tee (IASC)
6to make further improvements to
the IAS. In return, they promised to promotethe national use of IAS.
Both the Basel Committee on Banking Super-
vision (BCBS) and the International Organisa-tion of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) haveassessed IAS, each from its own particularperspective. The BCBS thinks that IAS is gen-erally suitable for prudential supervisory pur-poses, although it felt that two standards(IAS 39 and IAS 30) required further com-ment. IOSCO accepted the IAS and recom-mended in May 2000 that its member organ-isations generally allow the use of IAS as a cri-DM bn  5 bn

The creation of a single European financial
market means that accounting practices willneed to be harmonised more extensively thanhas been achieved thus far by the accountingdirectives. IAS is an appropriate instrumentfor achieving that goal, particularly because ithas been designed for worldwide acceptabil-ity. The European Union’s strategy in account-ing practices follows along these lines. Withthe Fair Value Directive,
7which is scheduled
to be translated into German law in the nextlegislative period, the EU is seeking to enableIAS to be applied in conformity with the dir-ective as early as the 2001 financial year.Since the mandatory introduction of IAS from2005 will abolish existing accounting policyoptions, additional companion regulations
will be necessary. Given the probable ongoingdevelopment of IAS by the IASB, the EU willneed to put in place a continuous endorse-ment mechanism. In addition, EU interestsare to be asserted in the IASB already at thedrafting stage for new standards.

2001, to be applied in a manner complying with the dir-

46principle of prudence,8IAS (like US GAAP) is
geared towards informing investors, for whomthe balance sheet is primarily intended. Conse-quently, IAS contains more comprehensive bal-ance sheet formatting provisions than theCommercial Code, and valuation is extensivelygeared towards the concept of fair value, ex-pressed either as actual market value or esti-mated market value regardless of realisation.
Interest is currently focused on IAS 39, “Fi-
nancial Instruments: Recognition and Meas-urement”, a standard which is of primary im-portance to banks, and which has been ap-plicable since 2001. The vast majority ofitems in a bank’s balance sheet can be sub-sumed under “Financial Instruments”. Pursu-ant to IAS 39, the relevant financial assetsand financial liabilities are assignable to oneof four categories which are distinctly differ-
ent in terms of recognition and measure-ment. In addition, IAS 39 generally requireson-balance recognition of all derivatives, withspecial rules applying to structured productswith embedded derivatives. IAS 39 also de-fines hedge accounting principles.
The implementation of IAS 39 is fraught with
considerable difficulty for users of IAS. In thearea of hedge accounting, IAS 39 does notpermit strategies based on hedging entireportfolios (macro-hedges). Additional difficul-ties are created by the fact that under IAS 39only hedging transactions with third parties areeligible for recognition, and not those within acompany or group (internal contracts).
The BCBS has worked hard towards having the
issues relating to the application of IAS 39 ad-dressed in an IASB committee attended bybanks. The committee’s work on introducingthat standard produced comprehensive anno-tations in the form of a list of questions and an-swers. This, however, did not resolve all prob-lems deriving from the parallel use of fair valueand historical cost. The IASB will soon publish adraft amendment to IAS 39 for consultation.The most significant changes it proposes con-cern, firstly, available-for-sale instruments,changes in the value of which can no longer be
Hedge accounting under IAS 39
IAS 39 provides two key methods of hedge accounting:
Fair value hedge
Fair value hedges aim at hedging exposures to changes
in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability.
Cash flow hedge
Cash flow hedges aim at hedging exposures to variabil-
ity in future cash flows from the hedged item.
For both methods, IAS 39 requires a high degree of ef-
fectiveness and comprehensive formal documentationof the hedging relationship. In addition, fair valuehedging is permitted only for micro-hedges. For cashflow hedges, evidence must be furnished of a sufficientvolume of variable future cash flows for the hedgingrelationship.

8The annual accounts of credit institutions and financial
service institutions should provide a fair and accurate pic-
ture of the assets, financial position and profitability of
the enterprise in line with German generally accepted ac-
counting principles (section 340a of the Commercial
Code read in conjunction with section 264 (2) of the
Commercial Code). The specific regulations to be fol-
lowed here concern the itemisation, valuation and dis-
closure of the annual accounts positions, which in Ger-
many have traditionally been defined by the principles of
prudence and creditor protection. The main objective is to
ascertain profit available for distribution to shareholders.IAS 39Hedge account-

47posted to the profit and loss account but in-
stead must be exclusively posted directly toequity. Secondly, an extensive option to desig-nate any financial instrument as held for trad-ing and therefore to be measured at fair valueis being proposed. This presumably also repre-sents an attempt to find a solution to thehedge accounting problem. This is achieved ifnot only the hedging instrument but also thehedged item are valued at fair value and thecountervailing changes in value – in an idealcase – cancel each other out in terms of amount.It will depend greatly on the comments put for-ward in the consultation procedure whetherand how these proposals are implemented.
IAS 39 ultimately represents the first concrete
reflection of the efforts undertaken by theIASB to advance the use of fair value account-ing for financial instruments. The original all-embracing concept of full fair value account-ing had encountered open criticism and reser-vations. The more specific provisions in IAS 39were then developed as an interim solution,albeit without any set expiry date.
A further regulation with considerable rele-
vance for banks is IAS 30, “Disclosure in theFinancial Statements of Banks and Similar Fi-nancial Institutions”. This bank-specific stand-ard governing the information to be disclosedin credit institutions’ and similar institutions’financial statements is intended to helpstandardise and improve the disclosure, andthereby the transparency, of financial institu-tions’ financial situation. IAS 30 is being re-vised at present, with the IASB having actedon a proposal by the BCBS. In particular, a fu-ture version of IAS 30 may contain an exten-sion of the risk disclosure requirement. The
German Accounting Standards Committeehas already taken account of this develop-ment by adopting a standard for the risk dis-closure of credit and financial services institu-tions (DRS 5-10) which applies to financialyears beginning after 31 December 1999.
US GAAP
US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(US GAAP) have been gaining increasing signifi-cance for major German enterprises for two rea-sons. One is that the US Securities and ExchangeCommission (SEC) has made the application ofthese principles mandatory for listing on a USstock exchange. The other is that the pool ofpotentially worldwide investors has been ex-panding continuously in the wake of globalisa-tion. Important investors come from the Anglo-American countries and therefore prefer dealingwith familiar accounting and disclosure methodswhen making investment decisions.
The chief characteristic of US GAAP is its
dense mass of specific regulations. One couldsay US GAAP is a case-based system ratherthan a code-based system, reflecting the factthat US law is based on case law. Another fea-ture of US GAAP is its fluidity, for its rules areconstantly being amended or supplemented.
US GAAP generally lacks explicit options
owing to its plurality of individual provisions.That is intended to minimise the scope for in-terpretation. In practice, however, there is thegrowing danger of tailoring business transac-tions to a preferred rule or intentionally cir-

engineer the desired balance sheet result or toavoid an undesired reporting method. This canundermine the effect actually intended by arule.
US GAAP is often described as embodying
the principle of fair presentation, whose over-riding aim is to prevent the circumvention ofcase-by-case rules and thus to serve the inter-ests of those for whom the rules are intend-ed. Such a general clause is not expressly co-dified in the official sources of US GAAP .However, fair presentation is a principle ofauditing US financial statements, compliancewith which must be confirmed by the auditor.
US GAAP has achieved high esteem world-
wide, particularly because of the size and im-portance of the US economy. In the wake ofthe increasing efforts towards achieving inter-nationally accepted and applicable rules asembodied by the IAS, however, US GAAP isfacing serious competition which seeks toeliminate some of the shortcomings of GAAP .Recent events surrounding the collapse of theUS energy trader Enron have exposed suchweaknesses, leading to criticism which hasalso aroused international attention. The Ap-pendix at the end of this article will discussimportant aspects of the Enron case.
Prudential consequences
of the internationalisationof accounting practices
The prudential regulations in the German
Banking Act are based on the accountingrules contained in the Commercial Code
which apply equally to all credit institutionsand which are to that extent competition-neutral. They are based on banks’ single-entity financial statements and the underlyingaccounting and valuation decisions. The con-solidated supervision of banking groups isbased on the supervisors’ own consolidationrules as contained in section 10a of the Bank-ing Act. Consolidated financial statementsbased on the Commercial Code serve only in-formational purposes with regard to bankingsupervisors, too, with the exception of inter-nationally operating German institutions,which additionally calculate an own-fundsratio pursuant to the Basel Capital Accordbased on their consolidated financial state-ments. The application of different account-ing standards for consolidated financial state-ments (IAS or US GAAP) does not create acompetition-related problem since these insti-tutions are likewise required to comply withthe business and risk reduction standards ofthe Banking Act.
How the national options for applying IAS as
proposed by the European Commission willbe translated into German law is an issue thatwill be debated intensively. Before IAS can beapplied to the consolidated financial state-ments of non-listed enterprises or even to thesingle-entity financial statements of eitherlisted or non-listed enterprises, too, it will firstbe necessary to answer key questions relat-ing, above all, to the implications for the uni-formity of national accounting practices,creditor protection, or the requirement ofcapital preservation.

49national accounting standards by companies
to their single-entity financial statementsmust be rejected unless it is assured, in com-pliance with the tried and tested commercial-law principles of creditor protection, that thecomparability of single-entity financial state-ments is preserved, for they form the basisfor profit distribution, tax payments and pru-dential capital adequacy requirements.
The traditional German financial statement
based on the Commercial Code, by stressingthe prudent calculation of profit, is used todetermine both the distributable profit and,owing to the primacy of the commercial ac-counts, the amount of tax to be paid.
9Owing
to this methodological link between the com-mercial balance sheet and the tax balancesheet, all further considerations regarding fu-ture requirements for drawing up single-entity financial statements have implicationsnot only for commercial law but also for taxlaw. For Germany, therefore, the question willarise as to the calculation of profit for tax pur-poses and the consequences for the tax bal-ance sheet and whether dual accounting maybe tolerated for single-entity financial state-ments and consolidated financial statements.
In contrast to the German commercial bal-
ance sheet, a financial statement drawn upaccording to IAS or US GAAP does not serveto measure distributable profit, let alone toprudently measure distributable profit. Thetried and tested system of German GAAPbased on the Commercial Code prevents in-come from being reported before gains haveactually been realised or the risk of losses hasbeen permanently averted. Financial state-ments drawn up according to international
accounting standards are geared solely to-wards providing information considered rele-vant for investors’ decisions, in particular, andare designed to give a true and fair view of acompany’s assets, financial situation and prof-itability. Although this, too, can be seen asserving creditor protection interests, it is notfocused on recognition and measurementrules for purposes other than transparency. Atrue and fair view of the actual financial situ-ation requires a more extensive application ofmarket valuation and abandoning the histor-ical cost as the value ceiling as well as the uni-lateral recognition of only negative changesin value (unless the reinstatement of originalvalue is required). The principle of marketvaluation is not contained in German law.The different recognition and measurementrules under German GAAP and IAS thus giverise to at times major differences in the calcu-lation and disclosure of net profit or loss,which also affects the amount of balancesheet capital relevant for prudential purposes.
A key prudential problem with accounting
under IAS 39 is created by the recognition offair value in categories such as “available-for-
9For fixed assets and current assets the initial measure-
ment is at historical cost, and this historical cost is at the
same time the value ceiling for remeasurements. Current
assets have to be written down on the reporting date if a
lower value (stock exchange price, market price, fair
value) is determined (strict principle of lower of cost or
market). Fixed assets must be written down only if a last-
ing value impairment is likely (diluted principle of lower
of cost or market). According to the commercial-law prin-
ciples of German GAAP , only realised gains can be in-
cluded in the net profit or loss, whereas expenditure has
to be included in the net profit or loss even if it has not
yet been realised. The Commercial Code requires the
most objective valuation possible; discretionary scope
exists mostly regarding the valuation of assets for which
no stock exchange or market prices are available and for
transfers to provisions.Conceptual

50sale” financial assets. The corresponding
changes in the value of balance sheet assetsare posted directly to a separate equity itemwhich, as a revaluation reserve, can beequated to unrealised reserves and thereforeis classified as additional capital for prudentialpurposes. If, by contrast, the alternative ac-counting option is taken of posting suchchanges to the profit and loss account, thechange in the value of the asset flows directlyinto retained profits, which in prudentialterms are considered core capital. Supervisorsneed to find appropriate methods of treatingthe different outcomes of such valuations,also in comparison to other components ofthe various categories of regulatory capital.The same applies to the prudential treatmentof deferred taxes resulting from valuationpursuant to IAS.The international standard setters have a pref-
erence for full fair value accounting so as tomake it impossible to put a positive gloss onthe annual accounts by reclassifying assets toasset categories valued according to otherprinciples. The banking industry and bankingsupervisors, as well as the European Commis-sion and the European Central Bank, how-ever, all oppose the use of full fair value ac-counting for all financial instruments. Unlikefair value accounting for marketable financialinstruments, there are considerable problemsinvolved in calculating the fair value of instru-ments such as loans, for which no active andliquid market exists at present in Germanyand many other countries. The fair valuewould, in this case, have to be estimated, butthere is no recognised and reliable procedurefor doing so.

51methods (mark-to-model), as well as the as-
sumptions that would have to be made forthe estimate, would offer a considerableamount of discretionary scope for valuationwhich would seriously impair the reliability ofthe accounting items calculated in this man-ner. Moreover, full fair value accounting maybe expected to lead to a greater volatility of re-sults, which could affect the stability of the fi-nancial system and also trigger a change inbanks’ behaviour. To control the volatility oftheir results, banks might be prompted toshorten the length of time during which inter-est rates and capital are locked in, thus causingthe terms of long-term finance to deteriorate.At the same time, the incentive to transformmaturities will depend much more than in thepast on short-term capital-market conditions.
In fair value accounting, individual value ad-
justments and general value adjustmentshave no accounting importance whatsoever.They are automatically taken into account ifexpected future payment streams are dis-counted to their present value. In the “mixedmodel” of IAS 39, however, there are – asmentioned earlier – financial instrumentswhich are valued at amortised cost. They aresubjected to an impairment test and, if neces-sary, written down to the lower fair value. Inthis case the value adjustments are deductedfrom capital. Whereas this accounting ap-proach focuses more on the reporting dateand disregards potential value impairmentsrelated to future events, regulators have agreater propensity to take account of expect-ed negative future events. This is not contra-dicted by the calculation of general value ad-justments in practice, in the view of bankingsupervisors. Aspects of the internationally
widely discussed process of “dynamic provi-sioning”, in which provision is made for ex-pected losses based on solid past experience,can and should subsequently be taken intoaccount when calculating general value ad-justments. Such a practice of risk provisioningshould also be recognised for tax purposessince that would offer an incentive for ad-equate risk provisioning, give an accurate im-pression of taxability and contribute to re-inforcing the stability of the financial system.
German banks will face a major change when
they switch to using international accountingstandards in that they will no longer beallowed to include undisclosed contingencyreserves in their consolidated financial state-ments or, for all practical purposes, in theirsingle-entity financial statements, either.
10A
10The Commercial Code contains industry-specific regu-
lations for the accounting practices of credit institutions
and financial services institutions; these regulations sup-
plement and sometimes amend the generally applicable
principles. That is the background against which, in par-
ticular, the legal option of forming and releasing items
which make provision for general banking risks and
which constitute a special form of the principle of pru-
dence is to be seen (sections 340f and 340g of the Com-
mercial Code). These instruments may be used to set up
balance sheet reserves which, if necessary, can be subse-
quently mobilised to enhance disclosed profits. Transfers
to and the release of such reserves, which show up in net
profit or loss, and the existence of a reserve item under
section 340f of the Commercial Code, are generally not
apparent in the accounts since they are offset by other
items in the balance sheet or profit and loss account.
“Undisclosed contingency reserves” provide scope for
discreetly smoothing the result so as to avert a threat to
the company’s ability to continue as a going concern
caused by excessive market reactions such as a run by de-
positors to deteriorating profitability and in order to buy
time for corrective countermeasures. To that extent, this
instrument runs counter to the transparency espoused in
international accounting standards. Transfers to, the re-
lease of and the amount of the special item for general
banking risks pursuant to section 340g of the Commer-
cial Code are transparently listed in separate items of the
balance sheet or profit and loss account and so are easily
traceable for the observer.Value

52number of institutions which are already ap-
plying international accounting standardshave voluntarily abandoned this instrument.However, German banking supervisors con-tinue to regard undisclosed contingency re-serves pursuant to section 340f of the Com-mercial Code as being important for the sta-bility of the financial system. The Bundes-bank, for its part, advocates the continueduse of the undisclosed reserves instrument forall commercial single-entity financial state-ments. To that extent, it will be necessary totolerate a conflict of interest with the aim ofgreater transparency and market discipline(Pillar 3 of the new Basel Capital Accord).
Pillar 3 (market discipline) of the new Basel
Capital Accord (Basel II) is aimed at subjectingbanks to market discipline as a complementto banking supervision. Banks are required toinform current and potential investors, coun-terparties and customers as well as the gen-eral public of their capital base and their riskprofile. These extended transparency stand-ards for the supervised institutions are con-sonant with current accounting trends. By ex-panding the disclosure of information andbanking risks, as is envisaged by the IAS, mar-ket mechanisms and markets’ risk analysescan be used as an adjunct to prudential bank-ing supervision in order to reinforce the stabil-ity of the financial markets. To avoid placingundue strain on institutions and also to avoidconfusing analysts and observers with differ-ing data, it must be ensured that informationaccording to a revised IAS 30 and the require-ments of Pillar 3 are harmonised as far as pos-sible.
11Appendix: The international debateon the consequences of the insolvencyof the US energy trader Enron
The collapse of the US energy trader Enron in
late 2001 attracted international attention.The Enron case had consequences not onlyfor the company itself, its investors and itsemployees, but also for its auditing firm,which now is even on trial for its role in con-cealing Enron’s shady business practices.
The Enron case has triggered an international
debate on the causes and the necessary con-sequences in order to avoid future market dis-ruptions like those which ensued as a conse-quence of a general loss of confidence inpublished company financial statements.Fraudulent business activities and the wilfulviolation of rules may have been partly toblame for Enron’s collapse. However, somefundamental flaws and gaps in the account-ing, auditing and corporate governance prac-tices were brought to light, too.
US GAAP , being a large compendium of spe-
cific rules, created incentives for Enron to ei-ther circumvent or abuse them. Enron con-ducted many types of business for the solepurpose of being able to present a favourablefinancial statement according to US GAAP . Itestablished non-consolidated “special-pur-

Since the single-entity and consolidated financial state-
ments also provide information to banking supervisors, it
will be necessary to come up with solutions which ensure
that supervisors receive the information they need at a
sufficient level of disaggregation and that breaks in the

imum.Need to

53pose entities” to this end in order, for in-
stance, to remove debt from the balancesheet and to create financial turnover whichnetted to zero but conveyed to the markets afalse impression of growth and liquidity. Ba-sically, Enron was following the letter ofUS GAAP – yet violating the spirit.
The debate on Enron has also given rise to
critical questions regarding the increasingpractice of publishing “pro forma results”
12
which are often quite different from theaudited figures published in the certified fi-nancial statements. It is clear that pro formaresults are no substitute for a more preciseanalysis of a company’s financial situation.
Accounting rules which produce reliable fi-
nancial statements are by themselves insuffi-cient if there is no credible institutional pro-cedure for enforcing them. The SEC wasgiven this role in the United States. To that ex-tent, the USA now has a mechanism in placefor enforcing accounting standards, eventhough criticism has grown that the SEC isunderstaffed and underfunded. In Germany,only the activity of the court of registration(Registergericht ), if anything, can be seen as
performing a similar sovereign function of en-forcing rules. It may well make sense toexamine whether Germany, too, could use anexplicit enforcement mechanism. One idea inthis respect might be for the court of registra-tion and the German Accounting StandardsCommittee to join forces.
Moreover, in the Enron case – as well as simi-
lar problem cases in Germany (Balsam AG,Flowtex or Philipp Holzmann) – the auditingof corporate financial statements by individ-
ual external auditing firms has proved inad-equate. In the Enron case the auditors notonly tacitly approved dubious accountingpractices but seemingly even made it moredifficult to unearth them by destroying evi-dence. A general question in the field ofauditing is just how independent auditorsreally are, especially since often auditing firmssimultaneously provide auditing and consult-ancy services to the same client. It is true thatthere are already international standards suchas the International Standards on Auditing(ISA) or the Code of Ethics of the Internation-al Auditing Practices Committee (IAPC). How-ever, the use of these standards is not bind-ing, nor are auditing firms explicitly super-vised by government agencies. However, theauditing industry, as a consequence of pastshortcomings, has been conducting mutualpeer reviews. At the end of such reviews, theexamining firm can present recommenda-tions for implementation. Whether such peerreviews will suffice to restore the lost confi-dence is a matter for study. The industry isalso conducting international discussions onfurther quality assurance measures in audit-ing financial statements.
In the Enron case, as in many other problem
cases, deficits in corporate governance wereuncovered. Transparency in this area shouldbe increased across the board. The voluntarycorporate governance code for companiesintroduced in Germany at the end of

Althoughcompliance with these standards is voluntary,enterprises will be required to submit a writ-ten comment once a year in which any non-compliance with individual standards willhave to be explicitly stated.

Last but not least, Enron also triggered a re-
newed debate on the role of rating agencies.Not only the markets but also banking super-visors, who will need to rely on external rat-ings for enforcing the new Basel II rules, areparticularly interested in seeing the quality ofratings improve. In the Enron case, ratingagencies came under fire for having given theenterprise an investment-grade rating just be-fore its collapse. Wherever possible, the mar-kets should be able to obtain more up-to-date ratings. This does not necessarily have tolead to greater volatility since changes in rat-ings, and therefore also market swings, willprobably be fairly small. An improvement inrating quality by means of an explicit supervi-sion of rating agencies by a governmentagency is also conceivable – although super-
visors would have to confine themselves tomonitoring working procedures and compli-ance with generally accepted standards.However, this is something the industry coulddo itself at potentially lower cost.
There are already some initiatives both in the
United States and in the responsible EU insti-tutions to address the above-mentionedproblems as well as other issues. At presentthe FASB is revising some of the US GAAPrules so as, for instance, to reinforce the con-solidation requirement for special-purposeentities. The SEC has presented a plan tomonitor the independence of auditors at themajor auditing firms. The European Commis-sion has also been active in that area, recentlypublishing a recommendation containing cri-teria to ensure auditors’ statutory independ-ence. Moreover, there are comprehensiveplans at the EU level to improve accountingand corporate governance practices as well.Additional EU initiatives aim at improvingtransparency in the international financial sys-tem, avoiding conflicts of interest among fi-nancial analysts and also the possibility ofregulating the activities of rating agencies.These efforts on both sides of the Atlanticshould be welcomed and should therefore begiven continued political support.

55Consequences of
increasing capitalflows for exchangerate policy –observations andprospects worldwideExchange rate policy issues are at the
centre of the ongoing debate on pos-sible improvements to the way inwhich the international monetary andfinancial system works. With regard tothe recent debt and currency crises inemerging economies, it can be said inretrospect that all of the countries af-fected by the crises had more or lessfixed exchange rate regimes and thatmost of these had to give way, in thecourse of solving the crises, to systemswith substantially greater exchangerate flexibility. The leading industrialcountries are sometimes accused ofnot achieving sufficient stability in theexchange rates between their own cur-rencies and consequently of havingcontributed to the failure of fixed-ratesystems in the emerging economies. Inthe light of the rapid growth in capitalmovements both within the group ofindustrial countries and between theindustrial countries and the emergingeconomies, however, the call for fixedexchange rates has lost much of its pre-vious attractiveness. Where there areextensive flows of capital, a high de-gree of exchange rate stability canonly be guaranteed on a permanentbasis if the exchange rate target isgiven priority, rigorously and consist-ently, over a country’s own economicpolicy. This is an extremely demandingprecondition, which can be met only inexceptional cases in practice.

56Sharp rise in capital flows alters exchange
rate policy environment
The dramatic increase in capital flows both
within the group of industrial countries andbetween industrial countries and developingcountries is one of the most important devel-opments in recent international economic his-tory. The industrial countries had initially pur-sued a fairly protracted policy of gradually lib-eralising their financial transactions. Somecountries, including Germany, had acted aspermanent pacesetters here. For a long timethere was often not only a lack of the basicconditions that were necessary for buildingup confidence, most notably policies thatwere consistently geared to monetary stabil-ity, if these countries’ own financial marketswere to reach a considerable degree of open-ness. Frequently, awareness of the economicadvantages of free capital movements (whichwere taken for granted before the First WorldWar) also had to be given time to developagain. In some industrial countries, for ex-ample, the last restrictions on capital move-ments were not removed until the beginningof the 1990s. Since then, financial innov-ations and advances in data processing andcommunications technology have given fur-ther impetus to the integration of the finan-cial markets in the industrial countries andhave thereby also promoted the growth of fi-nancial flows within this group of countries.By contrast, a major liberalisation of inter-national financial transactions did not beginin the developing countries that have madethe most progress in the catching-up process(emerging economies) until the past decade.This was encouraged by a worldwide para-digm change in economic policy which re-
flected both the final collapse of the Socialisteconomic and social model and the successof the advancing supply-side policies in theindustrial countries. A substantial inflow ofdirect investment was the main result ofthese countries opening up their economiesfor financial transactions. Moreover, many ofthe commercial banks and enterprises in theemerging markets acquired the opportunityto obtain refinancing funds from foreign fi-nancial institutions on favourable terms, withimplicit government guarantees and sup-posedly fixed exchange rates making it diffi-cult for creditors and borrowers to make real-istic estimates of the risks associated withtheir decisions. Owing to instituted reformsand a corresponding amount of built-uptrust, many emerging economies were alsoable to obtain large amounts of fundingcapital on the international markets throughdirect government borrowing. To that extent,an unexpectedly strong renaissance of a de-velopment which had already emerged in1973-74 as a result of the oil price increasesat that time (marked by a recycling of theincome of oil exporters to the energy import-ing countries) re-emerged but subsequentlycame to a standstill for a while because of thedebt crisis which broke out at the beginningof the 1980s.
According to the IMF, the total net amount of
capital flowing into the developing countriesincluding the present countries in transitionrose from an average of US$45 billion perannum from 1980 to 1989 to US$167 billionannually in the subsequent period up to1997. Primarily as a result of the many other

57debt crises since then, however, capital in-
flows declined again to US$73 billion on anannual average between 1998 and 2001. Ifthe breakdown of capital flowing into the de-veloping countries since the beginning of the1990s is compared with that of earlierperiods, it emerges that, for one thing, therehas been a sharp rise in the share of privatecreditors and investors in overall capital im-ports. For example, this ratio rose to 81% inthe period from 1990 to 1999 compared withonly 42% in the previous decade. For an-other, it is remarkable that of the capital im-ports emanating from private sources foreigndirect investment has been by far the mostimportant component since the 1980s. Thissatisfactory tendency (which not only helps tocurb the risk of sudden withdrawals of capitalbut is also associated with the transfer oftechnological and organisational expertise)has recently been encouraged to some extentby privatisation measures that are not repeat-able on the same scale. By contrast, a highdegree of volatility marked the remaining fi-nancial transactions of the developing coun-tries and has given rise to the decline in thetotal net capital imports of this group ofcountries since 1998. However, the recent de-crease in the amounts of capital flowing intothe developing countries is not only an indica-tion of prolonged uncertainty on the part ofprivate creditors and investors. It is also a re-flection of a fair degree of restraint in borrow-ing. By means of necessary adjustment meas-ures many developing countries have now re-duced their current account deficits or haveactually gone into surplus, with the resultthat the international financing requirementsof this group of countries are decreasing.The rapidly advancing integration of the fi-
nancial markets of the industrial countriesand the increasing financial transactions be-tween industrial countries and developingcountries have had unavoidable conse-quences for the exchange rate policy of thecountries involved. Extensive financial inte-gration of different currency areas meansthat the countries involved have little diffi-culty in financing even large current accountdeficits as long as the creditors and investorsare convinced that they can service theirdebts. Under these conditions changes in theassessment of the economic situation in acountry or currency area can result in signifi-cant international shifts in capital, and not in-frequently these shifts take place rapidly if itis financial capital that is involved. In such acase capital inflows triggered by optimisticexpectations open up the prospect of greatereconomic growth with increased demand forforeign goods and services by local investorsand consumers. In these circumstances theappreciation of the local currency would be amarket-related lever to make imports less ex-pensive, curb exports and thereby also pro-mote price stability in the currency area of thecountry concerned. Conversely, the loss of apartner’s confidence in economic areas thatare closely integrated financially leads tomajor balance of payments problems if thepartner’s foreign creditors do not renew in-vestments on maturity and the economic pol-icy makers, on top of everything, continue tobe confronted with persistent current ac-count deficits. Here, at least, a depreciationof the currency can be a significant help in re-gaining as quickly as possible the necessarydebt servicing capacity through an improve-

59ment in international competitiveness. Con-
sequently, as a price for the advantage ofbeing able to achieve greater growth poten-tial on the basis of sound policies, extensiveinternational capital flows generally necessi-tate a large measure of exchange rate flexibil-ity of the currencies concerned. At the sametime a regime of floating rates then removesmost of the benefits resulting from suchfinancial transactions, which seem to beworthwhile only as long as dispensing with ahedging of the exchange rate risk appearsfeasible.
No alternative to floating
of key currencies
Transition to freely floating exchange
rates as a result of economic divergences
The US dollar, the euro and the yen play a
role of paramount importance in the presentinternational monetary system. According tothe latest sample survey coordinated by theBank for International Settlements (BIS) onglobal foreign exchange market turnover (in-cluding futures and swap transactions), thesethree currencies accounted for three-quartersof all doubly recorded transactions (each par-ticipating currency is included twice in thecalculation, firstly, as the currency being re-ported and, secondly, as the partner currencyof all other currencies being reported). TheUS dollar, the euro and the yen accounted for90%, 38% and 23% respectively (while themany other currencies recorded made up theremaining 49%).
1The system of freely float-
ing exchange rates that exists between thethree key currencies is the outcome of the
collapse of the fixed-rate Bretton Woods sys-tem which was triggered by economic diver-gences and, consequently, increased capitalmovements. The then crucial step towards anew world monetary system was taken inMarch 1973 when Germany, as one of thelast major industrial countries and under pres-sure from exceedingly large inflows of dollars,stopped the purchase of the US currency onthe foreign exchange market and subse-quently went over to joint floating along withother European countries. Subsequent eventshave shown that the relevant industrial coun-tries are not prepared and probably would notbe able to gear their monetary policy – not tomention their entire economic policy – to theservice of a new worldwide system of fixedexchange rates. Instead, policy makers every-where give domestic economic objectives pri-ority. The European Central Bank (ECB) is ac-tually explicitly required by the EU Treaty (inkeeping with the tradition of the BundesbankAct) to safeguard the internal purchasingpower of the euro as its primary monetarypolicy objective. The scope for an active ex-change rate policy in the euro area is there-fore considerably limited from the outset.
One common basis for the floating of key
currencies is the fact that the respective cur-rency area represents a large and thereforewith respect to the creation of the domesticproduct a relatively self-sufficient economicunit. The degree of openness of the euro area– in terms of the average volumes of export-

60ed and imported goods and services in rela-
tion to gross domestic product – is, at cur-rently 19%, significantly below the compar-able figure for Germany in the year beforethe start of monetary union (28%). The de-gree of openness of smaller euro-area coun-tries, such as the Netherlands and Belgiumwhose transactions in goods and serviceswith partners in other currency areas werepreviously very significant in relation to theiroverall economic output (50% and 73% re-spectively), declined even faster still. The cor-responding figures for the United States andJapan actually amount to no more than 12%and 10% respectively. Owing to the out-standing importance of the respective domes-tic economies, the movements in the ex-change rate associated with floating at leastpose no inordinate problems in the three larg-est currency areas of the world.
Undesirable exchange rate developments
not unusual
As critics of floating systems had expected,
rates determined by the market tend to beprone to sharp short-term fluctuations. How-ever, fears that were occasionally voiced tothe effect that the volatility of the euro wouldincrease significantly compared with that ofthe Deutsche Mark owing to the more limiteddegree of openness of the euro area anda consequent assumption of a pronouncedneglect of the exchange rate have not beenvindicated. Moreover, the short-term ex-change rate fluctuations of the major curren-cies tend to be at the lower end of the spec-trum when compared with other financialmarket variables such as bond yields andshare prices. Another point is that the highly
developed markets for hedging instrumentshelp to overcome this type of volatility.
Even so, fairly large exchange rate movements
within a short period can have serious reper-cussions even for the key currency countries.However, there is no generally accepted yard-stick for assessing in economic terms the ex-change rates that develop in the market placeunder the conditions of a floating system.Substantial deviations of the exchange ratefrom its purchasing power parity must not beseen automatically as an undesirable develop-ment (ie a misalignment). As explained above,exchange rate movements in response to in-flows and outflows of capital perform a usefulfunction and should therefore be included inthe assessment of any exchange rate level. Asfinancial market players are not infrequentlyprone to displays of herd behaviour, however,capital and exchange rate movements areoften accentuated as a result. The pro-nounced appreciation of the US dollar to-wards the middle of the 1980s and the exces-sive strength of the yen at the beginning of1995 are examples of this. In both cases inter-national monetary policy measures ultimatelyhelped to bring about the necessary reversal.By contrast, the current dollar value is moredifficult to assess. The extensive net capitalimports of the United States – which offsetsluggish US saving, thereby financing invest-ment, consumption and economic growthand thus making a correspondingly large cur-rent account deficit sustainable – could quick-ly recede if foreign creditors and investorswere to view the future economic prospectsof the USA less favourably than hitherto.

61US dollar would then lose more ground. To
that extent, the present exchange rate patternappears to have a certain similarity with previ-ous patterns. Indications that the US dollar isdeviating significantly upwards from a reason-able exchange rate level also stem from therevival of greater protectionism in the UnitedStates in connection with the recent cyclicalweakness.
Should a spanner be thrown in the
workings of the financial markets?
Even if no major body questions the sense of
free capital movements between the indus-trial countries nowadays, there is still a widelyheld view that at least short-term financialtransactions and the exchange rate effects as-sociated with such transactions could be sig-nificantly curtailed by the worldwide intro-duction of a relatively small tax on all foreignexchange market turnover, with the resultanttax revenue being allocated to developmentaid. Advocates believe that such normal mar-ket measures would throw a spanner in theworkings of the financial markets but only tothe detriment of allegedly “superfluous” and“harmful” capital movements. This idea,which dates back to a suggestion by theNobel prize winner James Tobin in the 1970s,is based on the expectation that foreign tradeand longer-term financial transactions wouldhardly be affected by a slight rise in transac-tion costs whereas short-term capital move-ments – a not unimportant component ofwhich is the “haggling” over positions ininterbank operations – would become dis-cernibly more expensive and would thereforebe uninteresting in many cases.Volatility of exchange rates*

62Measures of this kind do not stand up to scru-
tiny, however. It is true that priorities shouldindeed be set with respect to the furtherliberalisation of the financial transactions ofthe developing countries, with direct invest-ment and other long-term transactions rank-ing highest. However, one of the features ofthe highly advanced integration of the finan-cial markets in the industrial countries is thatshort-term international financial transactionscan ultimately fulfil the same role as thosewithin a country or a currency area. The intro-duction of a Tobin tax, by contrast, wouldrepresent a permanent discrimination againstshort-term international financial transactionsin favour of both long-term internationaltransactions and short-term domestic ones. Itmust also be remembered that any suppres-sion of short-term capital movements reducesliquidity on the foreign exchange marketsand that the exchange rate fluctuations maytend to be greater rather than smaller as a re-sult. Furthermore, all previous experience ofother forms of intervention in the field of fi-nancial transactions suggests that evasivemeasures with corresponding distortions incompetition can be expected to increase. Thisis all the more likely given the fact that theintroduction of such an instrument on aglobal scale does not appear to be feasible.The fact that short-term capital movementsoften have no real effect on problematical ex-change rate movements also argues againstthe proposed taxing of all foreign exchangemarket turnover. A topical example of this isthe flow of capital into the United States,which is responsible for the strength of theUS dollar and which in the past few years hasconsisted mainly of direct investment andpurchases of shares, corporate bonds and
mortgage bonds. Consequently, the impos-ition of only a small tax on foreign exchangemarket turnover would probably have had lit-tle effect in curbing capital imports into theUnited States and the corresponding strengthof the dollar. Nor would a Tobin tax havebeen a major impediment even for the ex-tremely problematical debt of emerging mar-kets in the form of short-term foreign cur-rency liabilities (and even far less so for theissue of longer-term bonds, which is becom-ing increasingly important) because borrow-ers and creditors alike had considerably great-er incentives for their frequently inappropri-ate actions. Despite all of these objections,both public and private sponsors of develop-ment aid, in their understandable quest fornew sources of funds, are among the mosttireless advocates of a Tobin tax. They shouldgive up such unrealistic ideas in order not toend up in a dead end with their legitimateinterest in increasing development aid.
Target zones would lack credibilityIn connection with the start of European
monetary union (EMU) new impetus was alsogiven to proposals that the key currencycountries should cooperate more closely onmonetary policy matters. Some players andobservers saw the communitisation of themonetary and foreign exchange policies ofthe euro-area countries as an opportunity toorganise the joint efforts of the relevantcountries more efficiently in the interests ofgreater global exchange rate stability. The rai-
son d’tre behind this was not least the con-
cern that the decreasing degree of real eco-

63nomic openness in Europe might ultimately
be reflected in further increases in exchangerate fluctuations (a development which didnot materialise). Greater monetary cooper-ation was also urged in view of those othercountries which pursue a policy of fixed ex-change rates against any of the key curren-cies. The suggestions aimed at stabilising ex-change rates between the main currenciesrange from rather loose forms of monetaryand foreign exchange policy cooperation toan agreement on target zones and even aglobal monetary union. Target zones here areseen by their advocates as an easy way oflimiting exchange rate fluctuations, on theone hand, while leaving the monetary andeconomic policy makers of the participatingcountries with a certain degree of latitude, onthe other. To safeguard the exchange rate inthe event of its approaching the upper andlower limits that would have to be set foreignexchange market intervention would have toplay a major role in addition to the monetaryand economic policy adjustment measures.The advantages of joint intervention by theauthorities in both partner countries are oftenmentioned in this respect because coordin-ated action not only demonstrates agreementbut also increases the room for manoeuvre.Intervention by a country with a weak cur-rency is limited by the extent of its foreign re-serves and its existing credit facilities. By con-trast, some proponents think that, in prin-ciple, there would actually be no limits to thepurchases of a currency that is prone toweakness by the partner country concerned(which is using its own currency for the pur-pose).Target zone approaches pose considerable
practical problems, however. In particular, thevery setting of equilibrium rates that are rela-tively narrowly defined would be very difficultunder the conditions of open financial mar-kets. Not the least of the problems herewould be that precisely the major and there-fore largely self-sufficient economic areasbarely show a high degree of economic con-vergence over lengthy periods. Fixed ex-change rate target zones would thereforehave to be continually adjusted in order toprevent their coming into conflict with diver-ging economic and structural developments.
Substantial reservations must also be ex-
pressed about the view that in the event offoreign exchange market tensions a countrywith a strong currency can purchase virtuallyunlimited amounts of a partner currencyunder pressure to depreciate, ie without in-curring damages itself. Regardless of the factthat intervention does not alter the funda-mental causes of such tensions and, in prin-ciple, is therefore to be rejected unless thepurpose of the intervention is simply to miti-gate the effects of certain excessive fluctu-ations, the problems for monetary policy thatare associated with foreign exchange pur-chases must not be underestimated either.The advocates of target zones point out thatan intervention-related rise in the liquidity re-serves of the banking system can be absorbedthrough fine-tuning measures. In many casesthere are actually no serious problems in thisrespect. The Bundesbank, too, was usuallyable in earlier currency crises to neutralisemuch of the expansionary impact of foreignexchange purchases on the banks’ central

64bank balances. In a number of currency cri-
ses, however, it was evident that the centralbank’s own monetary policy can indeed beadversely affected by foreign exchange pur-chases if the imported funds accrue to do-mestic non-banks but are subsequently notused in full to reduce domestic borrowingand therefore result in a corresponding in-crease in the money stock. If the events onthe foreign exchange market are not re-versed, such expansionary effects can bebrought under control only by tighteningmonetary policy although such a measurecould further accentuate existing foreign ex-change tensions and would therefore becounterproductive.
This means in short that target zones for the
world’s major currencies cannot be regardedas an alternative to freely floating exchangerates as long as a satisfactory convergence ofeconomic developments and of economicpolicy preferences is not in sight. To achieve asatisfactory degree of exchange rate stabilityit is necessary, instead, to recognise the pos-sible causes of excessive exchange rate move-ments as early as possible and to make mar-ket players fully aware of the risks associatedwith their behaviour. Under these circum-stances international monetary policy cooper-ation means above all that, on the basis ofjoint analyses, the participating countries sup-port and monitor each other in their effortsto keep or to put their “own house” in order.In isolated cases internationally coordinatedforeign exchange market intervention cantherefore be a useful signal to the markets,indicating policy makers’ intentions andthereby helping to steer rates in the desireddirection. However, it would be more import-
ant to support the exchange rate policy inten-tions by adjusting monetary policy appropri-ately. To that extent, more exchange rate sta-bility would be gained through greater volatil-ity in interest rates. This connection illustratesat the same time the limited scope for a rea-sonable intervention policy for currency areasin which the exchange rate is of secondaryimportance owing to the limited degree ofreal economic openness. It is not least theemerging markets, which depend on accessto the international markets, that would suf-fer if they were confronted with greater inter-est rate volatility for exchange rate reasons.
Emerging markets’ exchange rate
policies increasingly polarised in favourof “corner solutions”
Generally speaking, the exchange rate sys-
tems of the emerging markets can be classi-fied into three categories. “Hard” exchangerate fixings or comparable solutions, ie cur-rency board regimes or even the adoption ofa foreign currency, are the opposite of float-ing exchange rates. Between these “cornersolutions” there are, as a third variant, a largenumber of “soft” exchange rate regimes,which make it possible to adjust fixed rates ina relatively uncomplicated manner. Since thebeginning of the recent wave of internationaldebt crises in the mid-1990s it has emergedthat most of the countries involved had previ-ously maintained soft exchange rate fixingsbut subsequently, under the pressure of theirbalance of payments problems, switched tofloating exchange rates for the most part.

At the same time the number of hardexchange rate fixings also increased slightly inthe emerging economies under review. Thesetendencies are consistent with the view ex-pressed increasingly in the past few years,namely that countries which already partici-pate to a large extent in international finan-cial transactions or intend to do so shouldchoose either a floating exchange rate regimeor the very opposite solution of an extremelyhard fixed-rate system in the interests of pre-venting crises.
Soft exchange rate fixings such as the trad-
itional publication of a parity, the pegging toa currency basket or the fixing of a centralrate with an advance announcement of cen-tral rate adjustments have, in fact, inevitableweaknesses at a time of increasing capitalflows. As a rule, they are suitable only as “fairweather” systems. If the country concernedis in an apparently satisfactory economic situ-ation and if no potential source of disturb-ance is identifiable either internally or exter-nally, the markets do not question such ex-change rate regimes. An apparently reason-able economic policy can actually help softexchange rate fixings to gain a substantial de-gree of credibility. In cases of this kind, how-ever, there is a growing risk that exchangerate fixings become nothing more than acatalyst for the emergence of the rudimentsof a crisis. For example, a relatively expansion-ary economic policy or structural policy fail-ings can have significantly detrimental effectson the current account. If this is not also re-
flected in a deterioration in the exchangerate, the economic policy corrections that areinevitable in the longer term can easily takelonger to be fulfilled. A fixed or inadequatelyadjusted exchange rate can also be helpful inmaking it easy to attract foreign capital for fi-nancing balance of payments deficits becausethe usual international interest rate advan-tages are apparently not offset by a corres-ponding exchange rate risk (for example, theRussian debt crisis of 1998 was also precededby considerable investment by foreign in-vestment funds in government rouble-denominated debt securities). A developmentof that kind becomes particularly problemat-ical if financial institutions in the emergingeconomies are the main channel for capitalimports and incur debts in foreign currency inthe process. In such cases exchange rate fix-ings may be regarded both by the financial in-stitutions themselves and by the foreign cred-itors (these are likewise predominantly banksor other financial institutions) as a kind ofguarantee for the capital importer becausecurrency depreciations with the subsequentlysudden surge in repayment commitmentswould inevitably result in a disruption of thefinancial system and of the entire economy inthe debtor country. Interactions of this kindplayed a crucial role in almost all of the recentdebt crises. As numerous incidents haveshown, however, fixed exchange rates cannotbe maintained over the longer term if the for-eign creditors – for whatever reasons – havelost confidence in the economic policy of thedebtor country. Dramatic exchange ratemovements then prove initially to be apowerful means of accentuating crises

66whereas existing exchange rate flexibility
would have helped to prevent the crisis fromthe outset.
In the event of increasing international capital
flows a policy of fixed exchange rates there-fore makes special demands on the sound-ness and flexibility of economic policy inorder to function satisfactorily. In the light ofrecent experience not the least of these re-quirements is strict supervision of the coun-try’s own financial institutions so that there isabsolutely no chance of irresponsible cur-rency risks being taken in the first place. Hav-ing said that, fixed exchange rates can still bevery useful for small open economies whichhave little diversity in their production and ex-port structures, whose foreign trade is highlydependent on the currency area concernedand which have flexible labour markets. Even
so, it would be a good thing if the fixed ratesystem chosen were “hardened” throughspecial mechanisms. For example, arrange-ments such as currency boards, which are an-chored in a country’s own political systemthrough special institutional safeguards, maymake it easier under certain circumstances toimplement any necessary adjustments to eco-nomic policy fully and speedily. The typicalautomatisms which in the event of an out-flow of foreign exchange immediately reducethe level of liquidity in the domestic economyand thereby compel economic policy makersto take a course of action that counters themore fundamental causes of the balance ofpayments deficit are crucial here.

67ened and was subsequently disbanded in
December 2001, intention and reality are twovery different things even with systems ofthat kind. By contrast, countries such as theNetherlands and Austria were able, preciselybecause of their credible policies, to peg theircurrencies to the Deutsche Mark quite un-challenged over a lengthy period. At all costs,fixed exchange regimes of any kind should al-ways be regarded as an aberration from theflexibility that is recommendable, in principle,where integration into the international fi-nancial system is highly advanced. Respon-sible parties must always be fully aware ofthe repercussions of such deviations for eco-nomic policy and must not have any unrealis-tic perceptions about the actual adjustmentcapabilities of their own country as reducingnominal wages to offset setbacks in product-ivity growth would represent the crux of theproblem. Fixed rate systems which only ap-pear to be hard create far more problemsthan benefits in the long run.
The objections to fixed rate regimes apply
even more in situations where a country hascompletely given up its own monetary policyand, instead, has adopted a foreign currencyas its legal tender. The main examples of sucha scenario are cases of dollarisation. Now andagain, however, emerging markets are rec-ommended to dispense with their own cur-rency not just as an exceptional solution butactually as a generally advisable measure pro-vided their external debt is also denominatedpredominantly in the foreign currency con-cerned. Even so, the protection against thedestabilising effects of a depreciation-relatedincrease in debt servicing and price pressuresthat this approach is intended to provide pre-
supposes that the countries concerned willnever be in a position to rehabilitate theireconomic circumstances radically and per-manently so that they can raise most of theirloans at some later date in their own cur-rency. Considering the large number of coun-tries which have succeeded convincingly inmaking the necessary adjustments, such apessimistic attitude does not appear justified.Another point is that the disadvantages asso-ciated with the adoption of a foreign cur-rency are underestimated. In contrast to thesituation in an appropriately organised mon-etary union, it might be that, in the event of aloss of competitiveness, a unilateral entry intoanother currency area would not guaranteethe freedom of movement of labour as an ad-justment safety valve. Nor can access to fi-nancial transfers be expected. The possiblenecessity of reintroducing one’s own currencywould admittedly be associated with incom-parably greater economic costs and difficul-ties than the simple change from one ex-change rate regime to another.
Fundamental support for floating exchange
rates for countries which participate or intendto participate intensively in international fi-nancial transactions in no way rules out themanagement of the exchange rate by monet-ary policy means. It is, in fact, the case thatnumerous emerging markets still try to influ-ence the exchange rates of their currenciesthrough foreign exchange market interven-tion and changes in central bank interestrates after changing over to floating ex-change rates. This may be partly due to a fearof depreciation-related increases in the cost

68of debt servicing and of inflation risks (a phe-
nomenon known in the literature as “fear offloating”). However, caution in exchange ratepolicy does not change the inherent advan-tages of changing the regime in question to afloating system. What is crucial is that in crit-ical situations monetary policy can quickly re-spond to changing circumstances on the for-eign exchange market and that all marketparticipants are fully aware of this. A man-aged regime of floating exchange rates istherefore also completely capable of contrib-uting to crisis prevention and of helping toovercome crises. Furthermore, the exchangerate becomes a less important guideline forpolicy making as soon as the country con-cerned has succeeded in demonstrating itsability to formulate an economic policy that ispermanently geared to maintaining domesticstability. Monetary policy makers can play animportant role here by pursuing credible tar-gets in their fight against inflation. Majorcountries such as Mexico and Brazil that werepreviously in crisis have made considerableprogress in this respect and no longer regarda repeated fixing of the exchange rate oftheir currencies as an option.
The international debate on the problems
posed by soft exchange rate fixings was con-cerned for a time with a – partly defensive –attitude which essentially argued that therewas a tendency to recommend to virtually allemerging markets to switch to “corner solu-tions” in their exchange rate policy. However,this argument was based on misunderstand-ings. In reality the question of the chances ofsurvival of soft exchange rate fixings has al-ways been directed at those emerging mar-kets which are already playing a significant
role in international financial transactions orare working towards such a position. By con-trast, emerging markets that are economical-ly less advanced and even more so the largegroup of other developing countries continueto restrict their financial transactions by ad-ministrative means. Most of these countriesare not yet able to borrow on the internation-al financial markets or can do so only to avery limited extent. Under these circum-stances classic systems of fixed though adjust-able exchange rates may function perfectlysatisfactorily and are therefore capable ofperforming a useful service, for example, asan instrument for disciplining a country’s ownmonetary and fiscal policies. In the interestsof crisis prevention, however, it would be im-portant not to miss the right moment for achange of regime in the event of advancingintegration into the world economy.
Regional currency cooperation as a
compromise between floating and fixing
The countries of western Europe, which have
always been closely integrated with one an-other, responded to the collapse of the Bret-ton Woods system from the outset by step-ping up intra-European currency cooperation.They did so in order to protect their tradewith major partners in the region against thedisadvantages of volatile exchange rates asfar as possible. The EC countries at that time(the Community of Six) responded inApril 1972 to the Smithsonian Agreement ofDecember 1971 by narrowing the fluctuationmargins for their cross rates to only 2

69The aforementioned Smithsonian Agreement
had temporarily ended the dollar crisis, whichhad reached a peak in August 1971, by re-aligning the exchange rates of the G-10 cur-rencies and by widening the fluctuation mar-gins for the new dollar rates (from €1% to€2
14%).2The EC currencies thereby moved,
along with some other European currenciesthat subsequently became associated withthem, in parallel within the fluctuation mar-gins for the dollar rates (snake in tunnel). Thebilateral fluctuation margins chosen at thattime were retained when, after repeated cur-rency turbulence, a joint floating system forEuropean currencies was finally introduced inMarch 1973 (by which time there was a slightchange in the membership of the monetaryarrangement). From these first major steps onthe road to greater intra-European monetarycooperation to the introduction of Europeanmonetary union (EMU) in 1999, however, itwas not just a long journey. It necessarily alsoinvolved accepting many setbacks and con-flicts, which repeatedly called in question thevery survival of any broadly based intra-European monetary cooperation. A gradualimprovement in the functioning of Europeanmonetary cooperation was not possible until,with the coming into force of the EuropeanMonetary System (EMS) in March 1979, allconcerned slowly began to realise that a per-manently greater degree of intra-Europeanexchange rate stability was obtainable onlythrough sustained economic convergence.The agreements on which the EMS wasbased made it clear in this respect that thedesired convergence must aim at a high de-gree of domestic stability if it were to be suc-cessful. Accordingly, establishing EMU wouldnot have been possible either if the ECB’s ex-
ecutive bodies had not been committed un-equivocally to pursue price stability. Monetaryunion was, after all, the result of the politicalwill to achieve comprehensive economic inte-gration, which, quite without precedent, hadbeen set in motion with the creation of theEuropean Economic Community as far backas 1958 and had led to the completion of thesingle European market by 1992. Further-more, EMU can be regarded as a decisive stepon the road to political union.
Fixing the exchange rate of their respective
currencies against the euro as the currency ofthe dominant economic area in Europe is anatural option for the European countriesthat do not (yet) belong to EMU provided theprerequisites for a successful fixed rate policyappear to be met. Even among the three“outsider” countries of the European Union(EU), however, only Denmark has so farjoined the fixed rate system of the Europeanexchange rate mechanism (ERM 2) (with afluctuation margin narrowed to €2
14%).
Switzerland as a non-EU member and inter-national capital hub is a particularly long wayaway from giving up the flexibility of theSwiss franc.

lar rates meant that the cross rates could vary, in prin-

currencies concerned had held positions vis-à-vis the
dollar that were diametrically opposite and then had re-
versed their positions over time. With their decision of
April 1972 the EC countries had limited the maximum
volatility of their bilateral exchange rates to the same ex-
tent as that applying to the dollar market.EMU has not

70prevails among the 13 candidate countries
as well. A similar polarisation between freelyfloating rates and hard exchange rate fixingsto the one found in all emerging markets thatwere reviewed emerges within the context ofthis group of countries.
As all present and future EU countries have
the chance of becoming an EMU member atsome time, they are ultimately able to over-come the dilemma that they inevitably face indeciding on a regime of fixed or floating ex-change rates in a satisfactory manner. Beforetaking such a step, however, each individualcountry has to fulfil the convergence require-ments laid down in the treaty. The relevantcriteria demand, among other things, mem-bership of the exchange rate mechanism ofthe European Monetary System (ERM 2) forat least two years as a standardised testphase to ascertain to what extent the candi-date countries can meet the conditions ofmonetary union without incurring significantexchange rate tensions. The standard fluctu-ation margin of €15%, which was intro-duced, as a result of the lessons learned fromthe EMS crises of 1992-93, to the exchangerate mechanism at that time (ERM 1), empha-sises how important it is, regarding the liber-alisation of capital movements to be com-pleted as a prerequisite for accession to theEU, not to lull the markets into a false senseof security with respect to their exchange ratestability but, instead, to guarantee a substan-tial measure of exchange rate flexibility. Theagreement on narrower fluctuation marginsor even the unilateral retention of a currencyboard will only be considered as exceptionswhose justification would have to be thor-oughly examined in advance. EU accession
candidates should not introduce the euroas their own legal tender unilaterally either(euroisation) because “jumping the gun” onthe steps laid down in the treaty on the roadto full EMU membership might have a detri-mental effect on the euro.
Other regions might use the European model
of complete monetary integration of coun-tries that are closely linked economically, adevelopment which was partly a response tothe collapse of the Bretton Woods monetarysystem, as an example of how, in the event ofincreasing capital flows, the desire for stableexchange relationships for a major part oftheir foreign trade can be linked with the ne-cessary exchange rate flexibility, but this willnot happen for quite some time. It is unlikelythat other groups of countries might be in aposition in the foreseeable future to copy thehitherto unique European example of trans-ferring national areas of sovereignty in largemeasure to common institutions. Even so, vi-able intermediate steps are also conceivable,and these, in the light of European experi-ence, should be pursued as early as possibleas the road ahead is strewn with many obs-tacles and setbacks. It would be important inthis context to work initially towards achiev-ing a considerable degree of convergence ofeconomic policy and economic developmentsand also to establish appropriate institutionsfor this purpose.

form an appropriate framework once the cri-sis in Argentina has been overcome. Simul-taneous efforts to create a free trade zonecovering North and South America might fos-ter integration within the framework of Mer-cosur rather than hinder it. In South-East Asiathe Association of South-East Asian Nations(ASEAN) constitutes another mechanism ofeconomic integration but is one that is com-posed of a number of countries at very differ-ent stages of economic development. In2000, moreover, the ASEAN countries to-gether with Japan, China and South Koreabegan as “ASEAN+3” to extend a regionalsystem of short-term financing facilitieswhich is designed to foster the stability of ex-change rates. The extent to which the finan-cing agreements which are the main featureof the project will be useful remains to beseen. At all events, it must be said, partly inthe light of problematical European experi-ence, that generous “emergency assistance”can easily lead to the entrenchment of funda-mental problems instead of their solution.
As an immediate objective, regional groups
of countries outside Europe which are rapidlygrowing together economically and which atthe same time would like to become inte-grated into the world financial marketsshould initially attempt to float all partnercurrencies and make use of their regionaleconomic and monetary cooperation toachieve a certain degree of uniformity in theirexchange rate fluctuations if this seems rea-sonable economically. Such a procedurewould also help to ascertain which countriesare actually suited to working more closelywith each other on exchange rate policy mat-
ters. A realistic longer-term goal for countrieswhich are cooperating successfully mightthen be to combine freely floating exchangerates with a system of intra-regional centralrates, thereby duly taking account of theEuropean experience that the intra-regionalexchange rates should be given the chancefrom the start not only to be adjusted quicklybut, if appropriate, also to fluctuate widely incritical periods. This type of monetary cooper-ation was easier in Europe by virtue of thefact that the Deutsche Mark had set a yard-stick for price stability owing to the credible

72Swap agreements under the Chiang Mai Initiative
The recent debt crises in East Asian countries
gave renewed impetus to regional cooper-ation on monetary policy issues in the FarEast. The multilateral swap agreements con-cluded within the framework of the Associ-ation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)
1
as far back as 1977 by five of the associa-tion’s member states (Indonesia, Malaysia,the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand) arethe basis of this development. The five coun-tries committed equal amounts of foreign ex-change for these agreements. The total suminitially amounted to only US$100 millionand was increased in 1978 to US$200 mil-lion. In May 2000 the ASEAN countries to-gether with Japan, China and South Korea(“ASEAN+3”) agreed on the fringes of theannual conference of the Asia DevelopmentBank in Chiang Mai (Thailand) to extend theireconomic and monetary policy cooperationin the region. The first step to this end was toinclude all ASEAN countries in the existingswap network. The level of funds providedrose to US$1 billion at the same time. Fur-thermore, additional swap agreements wereconcluded within the framework of“ASEAN+3”. These were on a strictly bilat-
eral basis and provided for credit lines be-tween what has so far been US$2 billion andUS$7 billion if two special credit lines whichJapan had already approved in October 1998(the “new Miyazawa Initiative”) are also in-cluded. The conditions of access to the finan-cial aid available under “ASEAN+3” (exclud-ing special credit lines) state that only the first10% of the maximum credit limit may beprovided irrespective of the IMF programmeconcerned. The swap credits run for 90 daysand may be extended seven times. Remuner-ation is based on the London money marketrate (LIBOR) plus a premium of 150 basispoints (with increasing remuneration for ex-tended credits). In many cases, however, thenegotiations on corresponding swap agree-ments have either not yet been concluded orhave not even been initiated. Over and abovetheir financial cooperation the countries par-ticipating in the Chiang Mai Initiative havedeclared their intention to subject their eco-nomic policies to a joint surveillance proced-ure and to improve the exchange of informa-tion on financial transactions.

European partners therefore had a standardfor their domestic economic policy whichthey had to follow if they wanted to maintaina high degree of exchange rate stability. How-ever, the anchor function of the DeutscheMark was not based either on a Communitydecision or even a formal German demand.The Deutsche Mark gradually assumed therole of the leading European currency as Ger-many’s partners increasingly became con-vinced in their own minds that the primaryobjective of monetary policy was price stabil-
ity. Even if other regions do not currentlyhave currencies which might convincinglyperform a comparable anchor currency func-tion, the countries concerned, rememberingthat in Europe, too, the key role of theDeutsche Mark materialised only gradually,should not see this shortcoming as a reasonfor easing up on their efforts to create thepreconditions for regional exchange rate co-operation.

75Direct investment
in the real andfinancial sector –the BundesbankSpring Conference2002In May the Bundesbank held its trad-
itional Spring Conference. This year, itwas devoted to the subject of direct in-vestment. One of the main issues dis-cussed was why enterprises from thereal sector invest in other countriesand what implications this has for theeconomies concerned. The other maintopic of discussion concerned mattersrelating to international mergers inthe banking sector.
Greater international economic integration is
an important feature of our times. It is ac-companied by new development opportun-ities as well as challenges arising from theintensification of international competition.Both are aspects which affect a country’s eco-nomic policy and therefore the central banks,too. In particular, central banks need to ap-preciate the relevance for them of banksfrom different countries merging to formlarger, new types of institutions.
The increase in global economic integration
can be seen particularly clearly from cross-border investment. For example, the foreigndirect investment stocks of German enter-prises have more or less quadrupled in thepast ten years. Globally, direct investmentflows expanded in the 1990s at an annualrate of some 20%, which was far more thanthe increase in cross-border trading in goodsand services. It is also worth noting that theseinvestment flows are mainly between the in-dustrial countries. The Bundesbank confer-ence accordingly focused on direct invest-

76ment in industrial countries (see the confer-
ence programme on page 77).
In the past, the Bundesbank has repeatedly
looked at the extent to which German enter-prises invest abroad, the level of investmentby non-residents in projects in Germany andthe conclusions which can be drawn fromthese two developments. The aim is, first, toachieve a better understanding of what de-termines this behaviour – why, for example,enterprises prefer to invest in one countryrather than in another. The second aim is togain a better basis from which to estimatethe implications of direct investment for thetarget country and for the “exporting” coun-try. The Spring Conference 2002 attemptedto shed light on some of these aspects.
Professional research often cites two key mo-
tives for enterprises to invest abroad. Theywant either to gain a foothold on the marketin the country concerned or to exploit costadvantages. Whichever the predominant mo-tive, different factors are decisive and differ-ent consequences can be expected for thehome country and the host country.
On the basis of an analysis of US investment
in Europe, it was conjectured during the con-ference that both underlying motives comeinto play (rather than market-oriented directinvestment being predominant, as is some-times assumed). This also implies that thisdirect investment is particularly responsive togovernment-set parameters. Several studieswere presented which suggest that govern-ments have various means of influencing anenterprise’s choice of location.One parameter is fiscal policy. Earlier analyses
often showed that US investors respond totax incentives in the target country. On ac-count of the US tax system, this effect is lesspronounced in the United States than in agood many other countries. Profits earnedabroad by US investors are subject to domes-tic taxation but only if the foreign tax payableis less than that which would have been pay-able in the United States. By comparison withinvestors from countries such as Germanywhose external profits are in principle onlysubject to foreign taxation, this should reducethe tax sensitivity of US firms when selectingtheir location. In actual fact, empirical resultspresented at the conference which werebased on data from individual enterprisessuggested that the tax sensitivity of enter-prises outside the USA is significantly higherthan that of enterprises domiciled in the USA.In addition, tax considerations appear to be amajor factor for investors needing to decidebetween locations in Europe; given the com-paratively great similarity of these countries,this also seems logical.
Similarly to the structure of tax systems, sub-
sidies can also provide an incentive to selectone location rather than another. This relatesdirectly to the debate about the justificationfor and rationale behind subsidy competitionbetween countries. From an economic stand-point, this kind of assistance can be con-sidered justified if the investment has advan-tages for the economy concerned – advan-tages for which the enterprise in question isnot rewarded by the market; in other words,the situation gives rise to positive external-ities. This includes, for example, the transfer

78of knowledge and promoting competition in
a given country. The extent to which external-ities such as these are actually linked to in-vestment is the subject of heated debate. Itwould seem at any rate to depend very muchon the individual case. This in turn suggeststhat governments should exercise cautionand review investment projects very carefullybefore granting subsidies.
A presentation on German investors in other
European countries involved an empiricalstudy of how their choice of location is influ-enced by fiscal factors in the broader sense.This includes the relatively high tax rates andthe importance of spending on the infrastruc-ture in the country concerned. By nature,such global variables are of only limited suit-ability for empirical analyses. On balance,however, it is evident in this case, too, thatthese government parameters have an im-pact on an enterprise’s choice of location andthat taxation plays a greater role than invest-ment in infrastructure. By contrast, EU trans-fer payments to individual countries werefound to have no significant effect on thestanding of those countries as investment lo-cations. Nor could confirmation be found forthe assumption that the sensitivity of invest-ors to tax and subsidy incentives has in-creased.
Empirical analyses which have no alternative
but to draw on aggregate data are not alwaysable to provide evidence of significant con-nections normally expected by an economist.In some cases, more strongly disaggregatedsets of data can help. At the conference, dataof this kind on German direct investmentwere presented as material which researchers
will be able to use in the future, althoughconfidentiality requirements need to be ob-served.
Although most direct investment takes place
between highly developed industrial coun-tries, the conference examined the effect thatthis has on the countries of central and east-ern Europe that are in the process of catchingup. How can they attract the interest of for-eign investors? What types of direct invest-ment exist in these countries? The responses,of course, also concern the current EU mem-ber states. They can compete as the bestlocation for enterprises or they can benefitfrom such investment if, for example, it is amatter of gaining access to new markets.
A survey of the activity of German enterprises
in the accession countries revealed that theyhave a variety of different reasons for invest-ing in these countries. The distance from Ger-many was also a decisive factor. In neighbour-ing countries, vertical direct investment ismore important than in economies which arefurther away. All in all, the study in questioncame to a positive conclusion for the coun-tries of eastern Europe: they benefit from dir-ect investment by knowledge transfer andalso record a capital inflow because theinvestors frequently finance their projects inGermany.
What effect will the impending EU accession
have on direct investment in the easternEuropean countries? A presentation whichattempted to apply the lessons learned in Ire-land to the accession countries presented a

79clearly optimistic outlook and saw a promis-
ing future for the development of direct in-vestment in eastern Europe. Not least, theIrish example suggests that in the futurefunds will flow to technologically more de-manding economic sectors. However, someimportant preconditions such as low taxesand wages and efficient management werecited. By contrast, greater scepticism was ex-pressed in a presentation which endeavouredto estimate the extent to which British enter-prises will be prompted to invest more inthese countries solely as a result of their ac-ceding to the EU. It suggested that EU en-largement alone would have little effect; animpact is most likely to be felt in the servicessector. However, this does not rule out thefact that the associated growth effect couldgive a positive impetus to foreign investment.
When analysing the motives behind direct in-
vestment, it is frequently assumed that pur-chasing and monitoring a foreign enterpriseare synonymous. In actual fact, however, theconnections between ownership and moni-toring are complex. At the conference thethesis was put forward that “remote” com-pany monitoring is guided by other principlesthan when the monitoring of how the busi-ness is run is very direct. Which of the twomethods seems the more appropriate de-pends not least on the sector in which thegiven enterprise operates. For instance, whena bank grants loans to enterprises, detailedinformation is vital. In this instance, a clearcase can therefore be made for a “local”manager and owner. With regard to bankbusiness with a strong international bias,however, “remote” monitoring can have ad-vantages. This kind of approach can help to
understand whether or not direct investmentimproves management efficiency and therebyboosts the economy. Accordingly, such con-siderations can also be applied to the devel-opment of rules which should be observed inrespect of takeovers by non-residents.
In the example cited above, reference has al-
ready been made to direct investment in thebanking sector, which has some significancein terms of total German foreign direct invest-ment. Central banks have, in addition, a par-ticular interest in such developments in thefinancial sector since they may have a bearingon the monetary transmission process andmay be important for the stability of thefinancial sector. Against this backdrop, directinvestment in the banking sector – by meansof takeovers of non-resident banks, for in-stance – deserves particular attention.
Economic theory has listed various motives
for activities of this nature. It may be appro-priate for banks to undertake internationalmergers or acquisitions because they arelooking for new customers outside their owncountry or are following their customersabroad. The reason for these mergers and ac-quisitions may also be that banks are seekingto increase their efficiency or to diversify risk.The empirical findings presented at the con-ference gave certain indications that inter-national bank mergers bring about an in-crease in profits. However, experience showsthat such effects take hold only after a fairlylong period of time. Empirical studies aretherefore not always able to provide sufficientevidence of these effects. There are also indi-

80cations that it is more frequently large Euro-
pean banks from comparatively wealthycountries which buy up smaller institutions inpoorer countries. This can be taken as a signthat experienced banks with extensive expert-ise purchase foreign banks and thus enhancetheir efficiency. Overall, research does not ap-pear to have come up with a cogent theoryto explain the international bank mergers. Inaddition, there are as yet few indications thatthe start of monetary union has given a boostto the tendency for banks to merge acrossmember states.
The closing discussion with representatives of
commercial banks also conveyed the impres-sion that there is a whole range of motives
which lead banks to acquire other institutionsabroad or to merge with them. The ultimatesuccess of such mergers mainly depends, inour experience, on whether a clear overallstrategy is in place and whether the partnersare “well matched”. What this means inpractical terms can vary considerably fromone bank to another.
The conference showed the phenomenon of
direct investment to be multifaceted. All inall, however, a very positive picture was paint-ed. In particular, direct investment can help tostimulate the catching-up process of lessdeveloped economies.
