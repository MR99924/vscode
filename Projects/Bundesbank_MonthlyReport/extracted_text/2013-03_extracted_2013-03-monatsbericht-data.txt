Commentaries
Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The performance of the German economy at 
the start of the year did not live up to the ex-
pectations created by the calming of the situ -
ation in the financial markets and the improved 
business sentiment. Industrial output in January 
was unable to break free of its weak showing 
in the final quarter of 2012, and the volume of 
new orders was significantly down on this. This 
was, however, offset to some extent by the 
performance of the construction industry. Out-
put in the main construction sector failed to 
match its low December level, owing, in part, 
to the effects of the weather. There was a 
strong expansion in the finishing trades, how -
ever.
Nevertheless, the sluggish start to the year 
does not call into question the prospect of eco-
nomic activity picking up in Germany. The Ifo 
business survey indicates a further improve -
ment in the business climate in February. Export 
expectations, in particular, are clearly pointing 
upwards again. Output expectations are also 
signalling an expansion of activity. In line with 
this, imports went up substantially in January after two months of extremely weak growth, 
and firms are continuing to hire more workers. 
Consumers have also maintained their opti -
mism in light of positive developments in the labour market. There are still no signs of any significant improvement in business invest
-
ment, however.
Industry
According to provisional figures, seasonally ad-
justed industrial output in January was down 
¼% on its December level. This decline, how -
ever, is likely to have been underestimated due to an expansion of the reporting population in the consumer goods industry. While manufac -
turing of intermediate goods, at +½%, picked 
up slightly from its depressed level at the end 
of last year, the general downward tendency in 
capital goods output continued, with a fall of 
1½%. According to current data, industrial out-
put was up ½% overall on the final quarter of 
2012.
In January, industrial sales declined by a sea -
sonally adjusted ½% on the month and the 
preceding quarter. Domestic sales posted a 
slight increase of ½%, whereas export sales 
contracted by 1½%.
The seasonally adjusted value of exported 
goods rose slightly at the beginning of the year 
by 1½%. Exports were up ¾% on the fourth 
quarter. Imports showed strong month- on- 
month growth, going up by as much as 3¼%. 
The increase was, however, no more than 1% 
compared with the prior- quarter average, 
owing to a significant decline in the value of 
imports in the two preceding months.
German industry received significantly fewer 
new orders in January than in December. The 
decline was broadly based regionally and sec -
torally, standing at 2% after seasonal adjust -
ment. This sharp contraction was due, in par -
ticular, to the smaller volume of large- scale 
orders in the mechanical engineering sector and in the manufacture of other transport equipment compared with December. Hence, the month-  on- month comparison is likely to 
overstate the cyclical trend. A further important 
factor was the 7¼% drop in demand for cars 
from other euro- area countries. Consumer 
goods orders likewise fell perceptibly (-2¾%). 
By contrast, the decline in intermediate goods 
remained moderate at ½%. Compared with 
the final quarter of 2012, orders were down by 
a total of 2¼%. Excluding the manufacture of 
other transport equipment, however, which 
had benefited from a number of large orders, Muted growth

there would have been a decline of roughly the 
same size. Intermediate goods fell by 1¼%, 
and capital goods by 2½%.
Whereas domestic orders in January were 
down only slightly on the average of the previ-
ous quarter (-¼%), orders from the euro area 
fell by 2%. Orders from countries outside the 
euro area decreased by as much as 4¼%. The 
way in which the large- scale orders were 
spread over the course of the month played a 
part in this, however.
Construction
Construction activity recorded sharp seasonally 
adjusted growth in January according to the 
figures, which now comprise data for both the 
main construction industry and the finishing 
trades; the figure was up 3% on December and 2% on the previous quarter. A marked contrac-tion in output in the main construction industry 
– owing, in part, to weather- related factors – 
contrasted with a considerable expansion in 
the finishing trades. New orders were weak in 
the main construction industry in December –  more recent data are not yet available  – owing largely to a decline in new orders for 
public civil engineering work.
Labour market
The labour market situation showed a further 
improvement at the start of the year. Un -
employment declined, and there was con -
tinued expansion in employment. In January, the number of persons in work in Germany went up at roughly the same pace as in No
-
vember and December 2012. The year- on- year 
figure showed an increase of 239,000, or 
0.6%. According to initial estimates, December saw a substantial rise again in regular jobs sub-
ject to social security contributions. The year-  
on- year increase was 353,000, or 1.2%. The Ifo 
employment barometer is still pointing to a slight increase in employment. Quite a large Growth in con-

number of positions are still  vacant, which is 
also reflected in the Federal Employment Agen-
cy’s BA-X job index.
The unemployment rate (using the Federal 
Employ  ment Agency’s definition) remained at 
6.9% in February. The seasonally adjusted offi-
cial unemployment figure fell only marginally 
on the month. However, given that the winter 
effects did not come into play until after the 
January reporting date, the underlying trend is 
still likely to be downwards. Nevertheless, un -
employment was still up by 46,000 on the 
year owing to the increase over the previous 12 months. The number of unemployed per
-
sons claiming insurance benefits rose by 
104,000, while the number of longer- term job 
seekers receiving basic welfare benefits fell by 
58,000.
Prices
The price for a barrel of Brent crude oil in Feb-
ruary was up 3½% on the January average. It 
fell again perceptibly in the second half of Feb-
ruary, however, owing mainly to the antici -
pated budget cuts in the USA and the discus -
sions about a possible end to the Fed’s bond purchases. As this report went to press, the price stood at US$108¾. Crude oil futures 
were being quoted at a discount of US$2¾ six months ahead and US$5¾ 12 months ahead.
Import prices fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.4% 
in January compared with the previous month. This is likely to have been due, at least in part, to the appreciation of the euro in the last few 
months of 2012. Domestic producer prices in -
creased by 0.5%, with price rises for energy 
being particularly marked. Import prices fell by 
0.8% on the year, after rising by 0.3% in De -
cember, whereas the annual rate of increase in producer prices went up from 1.5% to 1.7%.
Consumer prices in February increased by a 
seasonally adjusted 0.2% on the month. The 
price of petroleum products rose perceptibly, whereas food prices went down. The prices of 
industrial products and services showed a mod-erate increase. The annual rate of consumer in-flation fell from 1.7% to 1.5% according to the national CPI and from 1.9% to 1.8% as meas-ured by the HICP .
Public finances1
Statutory health insurance 
scheme
The statutory health insurance institutions and 
the health insurance fund once again posted a 
very high combined surplus of €8½ billion in 
2012, compared with €9½ billion one year pre-
viously. Of this amount, the statutory health in-
surance institutions accounted for €5 billion (compared with €4 billion in 2011) and the health insurance fund for €3½ billion (com
-
pared with close to €5½ billion one year earl -
ier). In consolidated terms, the statutory health 
insurance system’s revenue increased by just 
over 2%, while its expenditure rose by slightly 
more than 2½%.
In 2012, the statutory health insurance institu-
tions’ revenue (primarily transfers from the 
health insurance fund) rose by just over 3% on 
the year. By contrast, expenditure growth was 
½ percentage point lower. In particular, the 
usual peak in spending at the end of the year 
was smaller. This is probably due partly to all of 
the Christmas bank holidays falling on week -
days (unlike in 2011) as well as the fact that the 
abolition of the surgery visit charge at the be -
ginning of 2013 prompted patients to post -
pone doctors’ appointments. Overall, the statu-
tory health insurance institutions’ spending 
was substantially below the original estimates Unemployment

1 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain a detailed description of 
the development of public finances during the preceding 
quarter. For detailed data on budgetary developments and public debt, see the statistical section of this report.Deutsche Bundesbank

made in autumn 2011 (+4½%), which were 
used as a basis when fixing the level of trans -
fers from the health insurance fund. Further -
more, the 2011 expenditure base turned out to 
be considerably lower than had been expected 
at the time. The statutory health insurance in -
stitutions’ high surplus is thus overwhelmingly 
due to this overestimation of its expenditure. 
The institutions’ reserves consequently swelled 
to just over €15 billion at the end of 2012.
The health insurance fund’s expenditure (mainly 
transfers to the statutory health insurance insti-tutions) was up by just over 3½% on the year 
in 2012, while revenue growth was 1 percent-
age point lower. However, at just over 3½%, 
contribution receipts increased rather sharply 
and exceeded expectations. This is largely due 
to the favourable employment and wage trends. By contrast, the fund received signifi
-
cantly lower transfers from the central govern-
ment budget. The grant was lower than in 
2011, when exceptional payments of €2 billion had been made to combat the economic crisis, 
falling from €15.3 billion to the long- term tar -
get of €14 billion. Thanks to the renewed sur -
plus, the health insurance fund’s liquidity re -
serve reached €13 billion at the end of 2012.
The 2013 central government grant to the 
health insurance fund has been cut by €2½ bil-lion to €11½ billion. For 2014, a further reduc-
tion to €10½ billion is currently planned. The 
transfers will not be put back up to their regu-lar level of €14 billion until 2015. The abolition 
of the surgery visit charge will further burden the system permanently by around €2 billion annually. The resulting revenue shortfalls for the statutory health insurance institutions are to be offset by the health insurance fund’s  reserves until the latter have been exhausted. 
The autumn 2012 projection envisaged that the 
statutory health insurance institutions would 
record a balanced result in 2013, ie the trans -
fers from the health insurance fund were set at 
a level that would just cover the health insur -
ance institutions’ projected spending needs.

enue would not quite suffice to meet its ex -
penditure commitments, so that it would have 
to draw on its reserves. Overall, this would 
 result in the statutory health insurance system 
as a whole posting a slight deficit. However, a 
much brighter outturn currently seems likely 
given that the level of contribution receipts at 
the end of 2012 was higher and the institu -
tions’ spending was considerably lower than 
had been forecast in the autumn. This is set to 
persist as a baseline effect beyond the end of 
the year, despite some relative changes, pro -
vided that policymakers resist the perennial 
temptation to siphon off better- than- expected 
results for other purposes. The foreseeable sur -
plus will probably nevertheless be much lower 
than the 2012 figure.
Under the Act to promote competition among 
statutory health insurance institutions (GKV-
Wettbewerbsstärkungsgesetz), central govern -
ment’s share in the financing of the statutory 
health insurance scheme was envisaged to be 
€14 billion per year. The justification given for 
the rule- based central government grant was 
that it would enable the statutory health insur -
ance institutions to finance tasks relating to so-
ciety as a whole, although these tasks were not listed in detail. Any cuts in the defined level of 
these transfers help to ease the strain on the central government budget, but – bearing in 
mind the legislative intent – they also result in 
non- insurance- related benefits being financed 
by contributions to the statutory health insur -
ance scheme, at least temporarily. Such meas -
ures can provide real relief for the central gov-
ernment budget in structural terms only if the 
grants are reduced permanently.2 The resulting 
financing burden would then have to be borne collectively by the pool of publicly insured per -
sons. In this context, a clear and detailed list of 
the non- insurance- related benefits being paid 
for by the central government grant would help to create a reliable planning basis. This 
would decouple the contribution burdens from the central government budget and protect in-
surees from the frequent ad hoc interventions 
by central government.Public long- term care 
 insurance scheme
The public long- term care insurance scheme 
posted a slight surplus in 2012, which amounted 
to a minor financial deterioration in year- on- 
year terms. At 3½%, revenue increased rather 
sharply, but not as fast as expenditure (4½%). 
The strong growth in employees’ contributions 
(just over 4%) was in line with the favourable 
employment and wage trends. By contrast, 
pensioner contributions for the year as a whole saw significantly weaker growth, although they gained momentum in the wake of the pension 
increase in mid-2012. The raising of benefit 
rates by nearly 2% on average at the beginning Cuts in Federal 
grant should be explained better
Slight financial deterioration  
in 2012
2 Under the central government debt brake, however, 
one-off relief measures are also taken into account when 
calculating structural borrowing and thus when assessing 
compliance with the constitutional borrowing limit.Log scale

of 2012 was a major factor in the accelerated 
growth of expenditure.
A financial improvement is expected in 2013 as 
the additional revenue from raising the contri -
bution rate from 1.95% to 2.05% (plus an extra 
0.25% in each case for childless persons) is 
likely to be initially higher than the additional expenditure resulting from broadening the range of benefits, particularly for individuals suffering from dementia. In the longer term, however, the recent reform increases the al
-
ready emerging structural pressure to further 
raise the contribution rate for the public long- 
term care insurance scheme.3
Securities markets
Bond market
Issuing activity in the German bond market 
 almost doubled in January 2013 compared with the previous month. Overall, domestic debt 
 securities worth €128.2 billion were issued, 
compared with €74.1 billion in December 2012. 
However, after deducting redemptions, which 
were considerably higher than in the previous 
month, and taking account of changes in 
 issuers’ holdings of their own bonds, the vol -
ume of outstanding domestic bonds decreased 
by €14.3 billion. Foreign debt securities worth 
€15.8 billion net were placed in the German 
market, so that the outstanding volume of 
debt securities in Germany increased overall by €1.5 billion.
In the month under review, the public sector 
barely increased its stock of bond market liabil-
ities (€0.1 billion), after having redeemed debt 
securities amounting to €24.8 billion net in De-
cember. Central government (including the 
resolution agency which is classified as part of it) tapped the capital market for €1.6 billion net 
in January. It issued mainly five- year Federal 
notes (Bobls) worth €5.1 billion, but also two- 
year Federal Treasury notes (Schätze) worth 
€4.7 billion and 30-year Federal bonds (Bunds) worth €0.9 billion. At the same time, however, 
it redeemed 10-year Bunds and Treasury dis -
count paper (Bubills) totalling €6.0 billion and 
€1.2 billion respectively. The Federal states  redeemed debt securities with a net value of 
€1.5 billion.
In January, credit institutions further reduced 
their domestic capital market debt, albeit by a 
lower amount (€8.9 billion) than in the previ -
ous month (€20.1 billion). On balance, the larg-
est redemptions were in public Pfandbriefe 
(€13.5 billion), the outstanding volume of 
which has been on a downward trend for some 
years, and other bank debt securities that can 
be structured flexibly (€1.6 billion). New debt securities issued by specialised credit institu

tions to the tune of €6.5 billion net were placed 
in the market.
Domestic enterprises reduced their capital mar -
ket debt by €5.5 billion in net terms, after hav-
ing financed themselves through debt secur -
ities by the same amount in the previous 
month. The largest drop was displayed by other 
financial institutions in long- term bonds (€3.9 
billion).
Domestic non- banks stepped up their pur -
chases of debt securities by €7.7 billion in Janu-
ary. By contrast, foreign investors disposed of 
interest- bearing paper amounting to €1.7 bil -
lion. German credit institutions’ bond holdings 
declined by €2.6 billion; they sold domestic 
paper worth €7.5 billion and purchased foreign 
debt securities totalling €4.9 billion.
Equity market
In January 2013, new shares worth €0.7 billion were issued in the German equity market, pre-
dominantly by listed companies. In addition, 
foreign shares totalling €3.9 billion were sold in 
Germany. German credit institutions domin -
ated the buyers’ side of the market in the month under review, purchasing €5.8 billion worth of equities. Domestic non- banks also 
added €4.6 billion net to their equity holdings. 
By contrast, non- resident investors reduced 
their portfolios of German shares by €5.8 bil -
lion.
Mutual funds
In January 2013, €11.9 billion flowed into do -
mestic mutual funds, down on the €19.1 billion 
in the previous month. The inflows principally 
benefited specialised funds reserved for institu-
tional investors (€10.5 billion). Of the mutual 
funds open to the general public, it was mainly 
mixed securities- based funds and open- end 
real estate funds that recorded inflows (€0.9 
billion and €0.7 billion respectively). Foreign mutual funds sold fund shares worth €3.3 bil -
lion in the German market. Mutual fund shares 
were acquired by domestic non- banks and 
credit institutions, totalling €12.4 billion and 
€2.9 billion respectively. Foreign investors sold 
German mutual fund shares with a value of 
€0.1 billion on balance.
Balance of payments
In January 2013, the German current account 
recorded a surplus – in unadjusted terms – of 
€11.3 billion, which was €9.0 billion lower than 
the level of the preceding month. This was at-
tributable to the fact that invisible current 
transactions, which comprise services, income 
and current transfers, reverted to a deficit. By 
contrast, the trade surplus showed a slight in -
crease.
According to provisional figures from the Fed -
eral Statistical Office, the foreign trade surplus 
in January rose by €1.6 billion on the month to 
€13.7 billion. By comparison, after adjustment 
for seasonal and calendar variations, it was 
€1.2 billion down at €15.7 billion. The value of 
exports increased by 1.4%, while the value of 
imports climbed by as much as 3.3%. Season-
ally adjusted exports and imports each ex -
ceeded the average of the final quarter of 2012 
by around 1%. In this context, the price of ex-port and import goods declined slightly.
Invisible current transactions recorded a €0.6 
billion deficit in January, compared with a sur -
plus of €10.1 billion in December. Significant 
deteriorations in all three sub- accounts played 
a part in this. The most substantial factor at 
play here was the shift in current transfers from 
a surplus of €0.4 billion in the preceding month 
to a deficit of €5.1 billion. This reflects the fact 
that the revenue side is usually very high in De-
cember owing to EU subsidy payments. The services sub- account deteriorated by €4.0 bil
-
lion month- on- month and amounted to a def-
icit of €0.9 billion. This development was chiefly 
driven by the reduction in the very high income … and corpor-

from IT services in December, but also by a 
fairly large decline in insurance services and in 
the foreign travel account. The surplus in cross-  
border income worsened from €6.6 billion to 
€5.4 billion, primarily due to higher dividend 
payments on portfolio investment.
Sentiment in the international financial markets 
remained quite upbeat in January 2013. Conse-
quently, cross-  bor der portfolio investment saw 
net capital exports of €30.1 billion, after €36.8 
billion in December, principally on account of German investors acquiring bonds and notes and shares worth €22.4 billion outside Ger -
many. Their demand was mainly focused on 
debt securities (€15.8 billion). Some €11.3 bil -
lion of this figure was invested in bonds and notes, which were almost entirely denomin-
ated in euro, while €4.5 billion was used to ac-
quire money market instruments. In addition, they added foreign shares and mutual fund 
shares to their investment portfolios (€3.3 bil -
lion in each case). Conversely, foreign portfolio 
investors offloaded €7.7 billion worth of Ger -
man securities. They primarily sold shares (€5.8 
billion) and – predominantly long-  term  – debt 
securities (€1.7 billion).
Similar to portfolio investment, direct invest -
ment also showed net capital exports in Janu-
ary (€3.8 billion), after €4.4 billion worth of 
capital imports had been recorded one month 
earlier. This reversal owed something to Ger -
man enterprises expanding their foreign invest-ment (€3.5 billion). They channelled funding to their branches in the form of equity capital and 
reinvested earnings (€6.3 billion and €4.2 bil -
lion respectively). By contrast, intra-  gr oup credit 
transactions resulted in an inflow of funds to 
the parent companies located in Germany (€7.0 billion); the repayment of financial loans previ-ously taken up by the branches played a prom-inent role in this respect. The reversal was also 
driven by foreign enterprises slightly reducing 
their direct investment in Germany by €0.3 bil-
lion, after expanding it by €2.8 billion in De -
cember 2012. In this context, the €2.3 billion in capital withdrawn by way of intra-

Germany’s balance of payments in 2012
Amid a challenging external environment, Germany’s current account surplus grew distinctly in 
2012 to 7% of gross domestic product (GDP), which was only slightly below its previous record 
high of 2007. On the export side, this rise was attributable to the German economy’s ability to hold its own in markets outside Europe despite the significant slowdown in the pace of growth in 2012. This is partially due to the attractive product range offered by German exporters, although 
the euro’s lower external value also played a role during the period under review. Germany’s strong export performance vis- à- vis non- euro- area countries greatly outweighed the weak 
demand that its enterprises faced in the euro area.
The import side, too, contributed considerably to widening the current account surplus. In par -
ticular, the uncertainties emanating from the crisis in the euro area prompted German firms to 
hold back on their domestic investment, which adversely affected imports. While noticeable pro-
gress has been made in terms of correcting the current account imbalances within Europe, the 
2012 surplus underlines the fact that, owing to the greater uncertainty it has engendered, the 
crisis has also hampered efforts to reduce the overall German current account surplus. The 
increased desire for safe investments has played a role in this. Safe- haven effects helped to boost 
the net inflow of investment income over and above the structural surplus which is generally gen-erated thanks to Germany’s high level of net external assets.
According to the recent data release, Germany’s current account surplus has exceeded the thresh-
old of 6% of GDP – which is a benchmark score under the EU procedure for the surveillance of macroeconomic imbalances – for more than five years now. In view of the determinants of this 
development, however, it would be inappropriate to take short- term measures to stimulate 
domestic demand in Germany. Instead, there is a need for political efforts geared to continuing the necessary adjustment processes in the crisis countries and creating a sustainable institutional architecture for monetary union as a whole. This would lead to a permanent reduction of uncer-tainty, which would help to lower the German current account surplus.
In 2012, Germany’s financial account with the rest of the world was likewise chiefly influenced by 
the financial and sovereign debt crisis and the steps taken to alleviate it. Overall, the account 
recorded high net capital exports of €235 billion in 2012, most of which stemmed from public 
sector financial transactions. This was driven by a further increase in claims under the TARGET2 
payment system together with government assistance to the programme countries. The portfolio investment account also saw capital outflows. The high demand for German government bonds was more than offset by countervailing transactions in other securities segments. Lastly, the direct 
investment sub- account – which is generally guided by longer- term considerations – likewise 
recorded a net capital outflow. Moves by German firms to further expand their presence abroad were the main reason for this.Deutsche Bundesbank

Current account
Underlying trends
Germany’s current account surplus increased 
again in 2012. It rose by €24 billion during the 
period under review, which was considerably 
more than in the two preceding years. This 
three- year upturn completely reversed the con-
traction of the current account surplus that oc-
curred in 2008 and 2009 in the wake of the 
severe recession. In absolute terms, the surplus 
stood at €185½ billion in 2012 and was thus 
slightly above its previous peak of 2007. In rela-
tive terms, the surplus amounted to 7% of GDP , which was ½ percentage point below its 2007 level.
Faced with a difficult global economic environ-
ment and lacking any discernible tailwind from 
global trade, German enterprises still per -
formed well on foreign markets overall. This at-
tests to their strong market position and at -
tractive product range. Moreover, Germany’s 
net foreign assets, which have meanwhile 
swelled to a volume of €1,000 billion, yielded a 
substantial income surplus. Both of these fac -
tors underline the strength of the German 
economy.
The sovereign debt crisis in the euro area is 
 affecting the German current account balance 
through various channels. The demand from 
euro- area partner countries for German goods 
and services clearly declined as a result of the 
severe recessions in some countries. This was 
the main reason for the sharp fall in Germany’s 
current account surplus vis- à- vis its euro- area 
partner countries. The adjustment of current 
account positions within the euro area as a 
whole again made further progress last year.
However, other effects which arose as the crisis 
escalated last year have hampered the correc -
tion of the German current account surplus. 
For instance, the crisis in the peripheral euro-  
area countries was doubtless partly respon -
sible, via the uncertainty channel, for the re -
straint that prevailed among German investors. 
Through the related squeeze on investment in 
machinery and equipment, this affected a de -
mand component which includes an above-  
average share of imports. An additional coun-
tervailing factor was the euro’s lower external 
value, which made it easier for German firms to 
sell their goods in markets outside the euro 
area. The positive differential in cross- border in-
vestment income rose not just on account of 
the accumulated net foreign assets but also be-
cause of the widening yield spreads between 
domestic and foreign assets generated by safe- 
haven flows. The upsurge in the TARGET2 bal-
ance which was evident up to mid-2012 tended Marked rise in

to lower cross- border investment income, inas-
much as it related to a reduction in interest-  
bearing claims on non- residents.
Goods flows and balance  
of trade
Germany’s foreign trade momentum weak -
ened considerably in 2012. Goods exports grew 
by a nominal 3½%, which was 8 percentage 
points less than in 2011. Goods imports were 
only slightly up on the year (+¾%), after having risen by more than one- eighth in 2011. Real im-
ports are in fact likely to have shrunk during the 
year under review. During the same period, growth in external trade prices was relatively 
moderate on both the import and export side. 
Unlike in 2011 and 2010, when import prices increased considerably, no notable shifts oc
-
curred in the terms of trade in 2012. As a con-sequence, the sizeable surplus in volume terms was fully reflected in the trade balance. In 2012 the foreign trade surplus went up by €29½ bil-
lion to €188 billion, following significantly smaller increases in the two preceding years, which were greatly dampened by terms- of- 
trade effects.
The slowdown of global economic activity in 2012 was reflected in the reduced growth of 
goods exports, which came to a complete halt at the end of the year. The regional export pat-
tern likewise tended to mirror the marked growth disparities in the various international markets in which German firms are active. In 
the euro area, the value of goods deliveries in 
2012 was down on the year by 2¼%. This was mainly due to a fall of around one- tenth in de-
mand for German products in the southern 
peripheral countries, which are undergoing 
 severe recessions. The other euro- area coun -
tries, which are having to deal with the nega -
tive cyclical fallout of the sovereign debt crisis, 
could not offset this decline, even though ex -
ports to France rose by 3%. However, it should 
be noted that, statistically, this rise was solely 
attributable to shipments of goods associated with Franco- German aerospace joint ventures, 
which shot up by more than one- third.
By contrast, exports of goods to non- euro- area 
countries rose significantly in 2012. Revenue 
from this area went up by 7%, though this was 
only half the 2011 growth rate. However, given 
the pronounced slowdown in the pace of 
growth in markets outside the euro area, Ger -
man exports held up very well. Efforts to attract and retain customers – in what was a challen-ging economic environment – also by means of price concessions were aided by the sharp drop 
(up to the turning point in mid-2012) in the 
euro’s nominal effective exchange rate, which Big rise in trade

for a time sank to around 7% below its 2011 
average. This is consistent with the compara -
tively large expansion in goods exports to the 
United States, Canada, Japan and the United 
Kingdom. The rise in exports of goods to Asia 
(excluding Japan) in 2012 fell short of the rates 
recorded in 2011 and 2010. This was probably mainly due to the cooling macroeconomic con-ditions in China. Sales to that country rose by a 
mere 2¾%, following increases of one- fifth 
and more than two- fifths in 2011 and 2010 re-
spectively. By contrast, exports to the energy-  
rich OPEC nations, as well as to Russia and Nor -
way, flourished, whereas exports to central and 
east European EU member states grew only 
moderately during the period under review.
In 2012, capital goods made in Germany were 
in higher demand than one year earlier, led by exports of aircraft and spacecraft as well as of computers, electronic and optical products and 
electrical equipment. Manufacturers of ma -
chinery and equipment, however, had to con -
tent themselves with a small increase in foreign 
sales. Conversely, exports of consumer goods 
rose markedly during the period under review, 
primarily on account of strong demand for pharmaceutical products. Overall, motor  vehicle exports increased only moderately in 
2012, albeit with clear regional differences. Automobile groups sold record numbers of  vehicles, in particular, in the USA, Russia and 
China, while sales within the euro area con
-
tinued to fall perceptibly. Foreign sales of inter -
mediate goods expanded only marginally dur -
ing the reporting period owing to their rela -
tively strong dependence on global industrial 
activity, which was particularly hard hit by the 
prevailing cyclical slowdown.
Imports were clearly affected by investors’ re -
straint, which was reflected inter alia in a de -
clining volume of imported machinery and 
sluggish growth in imports of information and 
communication technology (ICT). Imports of consumer goods continued to grow moder

intermediate goods (excluding energy prod -
ucts) in 2012 was no higher than in 2011. En -
ergy imports rose by one- eighth in terms of 
value. While this rise was largely attributable to 
a renewed significant increase in import prices, 
the volume of energy acquired from abroad also grew distinctly. This primarily benefited 
Norway and the OPEC countries, but also Rus-sia to some degree. Overall, the regional break-
down of imports showed much less diversity 
than that of exports. This is not just a reflection 
of the German economy’s strong links with other countries in international value chains 
but also a result of long- standing supplier rela-
tionships which are also comparatively resistant to exchange rate fluctuations.
Breakdown of invisibles
Last year, revenue from and expenditure on 
cross- border service transactions both went up 
by around 7%, which was a somewhat larger 
increase than in 2011. On balance, the services 
deficit expanded marginally to €3 billion in 2012. The large sums of money customarily spent by German residents on foreign travel 
were not the sole reason for this widened def-
icit. An additional factor was the smaller sur -
plus earned from business- related services, whereas financial services generated a distinctly higher positive result.
The slowdown in industrial activity had a strong 
impact on cross- border services, which are 
closely associated with the production and dis-
tribution of goods. Transport transactions were particularly hard hit, with revenue and expend-iture growing by only 3% in each instance. By 
contrast, services indirectly connected with production activity continued to expand ro
-
bustly, and domestic providers of research and 
development (R&D) services, ICT applications 
and business- related services met with buoyant 
foreign demand. Similarly, non- resident firms 
greatly upped their provision of such services in 
Germany. With respect to the individual net balances, there are certain specialisation ten
-
dencies in the R&D segment that are favouring 
a German surplus, whereas foreign providers are becoming increasingly dominant in the 
commercial services segment.
Persistently buoyant construction demand prompted German building firms to continue 
to concentrate their production capacity more 
on Germany. As a result, revenue from con -
struction work, assembly and repairs carried out abroad fell by €1 billion in 2012 after 
 already having decreased by €2 billion over the Services deficit

preceding three years.1 Foreign construction 
firms likewise reaped additional gains from 
strong domestic demand. Expenditure on con-
struction work provided by foreign firms rose 
by almost half, albeit from a very low baseline. 
Moreover, expenditure on cross-  border engin -
eering and other technical services saw a fur -
ther large increase. Given the only marginally 
improved revenue situation, this component 
ceased to run a surplus for the first time in ten years.
In 2012, income from cross- border financial 
and insurance services increased by a compara-
tively moderate 2½%. In stark contrast to the 
result in 2011, expenditure in this sector de -
clined substantially by one- eighth during the 
reporting period. The surplus generated by bank commission income and insurance fees 
expanded by close to €2 billion last year.
German residents’ expenditure on foreign 
travel rose by almost 6% in 2012,2 which out-
stripped the already substantial increase of around 5% seen in 2011. This was primarily driven by German residents’ evidently strong 
propensity to spend, fuelled not least by their 
continuing high income expectations, which was also mirrored in their foreign travel 
budgets. Private travel expenditure went up by 
almost 7%, mainly owing to a higher use of 
travel services related to foreign vacations and individual visits.
3 This contrasted with spending 
on business trips, which shrank by 2% in 2012 after having already fallen by 4% in 2011. Look-
ing at the period of economic recovery as a 
whole since 2010, it is striking that expenditure on business travel is still falling far short of the pre- crisis levels. This is presumably due to cost- 
cutting measures by many enterprises which 
adjusted their business travel guidelines during the 2009 recession.
Spending by German tourists and business trav-
ellers in other euro- area countries rose at a well 
above- average rate (+6½%). Among the Medi-
terranean countries, Italy and France were the 
main beneficiaries of this greater readiness to spend. In Spain, however, travel expenditure stagnated, while in Greece it experienced a 
steep decline. Following a temporary upturn in travel to Greece in 2011, the country’s increas-
ingly tense political and economic situation clearly deterred many potential visitors last 
year. By contrast, the boom in travel to destin-ations in Turkey, Croatia and Bulgaria persisted. 
Furthermore, more German residents returned 
to holidaying in Egypt and Tunisia during the reporting period after visitor numbers had 
plummeted in 2011 because of the political un-rest. Following a sharp fall in 2011, spending on travel to Switzerland was down slightly again in 2012, which in large part was probably due to the Swiss franc’s persistent strength against the 
euro. To a certain extent, tourists traditionally 
favouring Switzerland as a holiday destination 
are likely to have chosen to visit resorts in Aus-
tria instead. However, this only partially ex -
plains the large 6% increase in spending on 
travel to this destination. Long distance travel 
to America and Asia gained greatly in popular -
ity in 2012 compared with 2011.
The turnover generated by domestic hotels and 
restaurants with non- residents continued to 
develop strongly in 2012, growing by 6%. Even 
so, the negative net balance of expenditure on 
and income from travel activity widened by 
 almost €2 billion to €35½ billion in 2012.
The surplus earned from cross- border invest -
ment income in 2012 was up by €5½ billion, 
which was caused by a decline on the expend-
iture side. The fact that Germany’s investment 
income account meanwhile shows a sizeable

2 Alongside vacation travel, this category includes business trips, private visits and shopping trips, journeys for educa-
tional and health reasons and excursions not involving an 
overnight stay.
3 Individuals’ propensity to spend more money on travel 
was not confined to foreign destinations. For example, ac-cording to data contained in the accommodation statistics, there was also a 2¾% rise in the number of overnight stays 
in Germany by residents, which was a similar rise to that 
seen in 2011.Deutsche Bundesbank

period) is attributable to the continuous build- 
up of its external net asset position over the 
past decade and a half. Nevertheless, total rev-
enue in 2012 did not quite match the prior- year 
figure; it was particularly dampened by lower interest payments from cross- border lending. 
Earnings from portfolio investment abroad re -
mained virtually unchanged in 2012, while earnings from direct investment were slightly up on 2011. Domestic borrowers paid almost 5% less interest on investments by non-  
residents in 2012 than one year earlier. Expend-
iture on servicing loans declined sharply. In 
addition, issuers of securities paid much lower 
dividends to non- residents. On the other hand, 
the latter obtained higher yields on their direct 
investments in Germany than in 2011. Labour 
income, which plays a minor role compared 
with investment income, recorded only a small 
year- on- year increase in both revenue and ex -
penditure.
Current transfers to the rest of the world 
amounted to €55½ billion in 2012. This ex -
ceeded the previous year’s total by €2 billion, 
mainly due to larger transfers to the European Union. By contrast, the value of corresponding transfers from the rest of the world to resident 
recipients fell by €1 billion to €19 billion. This 
decline was chiefly connected with lower net 
income from tax transfers which, however, had 
increased quite strongly in 2011. On balance, 
the deficit on current transfers widened to €37 
billion during the reporting period. The public 
sector accounted for nearly two- thirds of this 
deficit which, as usual, mainly arose from net 
transfers to the EU budget.

(€235 billion).4 Just under half of this sum was 
attributable to other investment. The Bundes -
bank’s accumulating claims under the TARGET2 
large- value payment system were once again a 
crucial factor in this. Additional capital out -
flows occurred inter alia in the portfolio invest-ment and direct investment accounts.
In 2012, Germany’s financial account with the 
rest of the world was again much affected by 
the sovereign debt crisis in several euro- area 
countries and the steps taken to alleviate it. Market activity was initially dominated by lin
-
gering concerns among market participants about the economic outlook in the euro area and doubts about the willingness of some member states to carry on reforming, which 
led inter alia to sharply widening government 
bonds spreads within the euro area. In the 
second half of the year, the Eurosystem’s nas -
cent Outright Monetary Transaction (OMT) 
bond purchase programme, together with the 
decisions regarding the establishment of a sin-gle supervisory mechanism (SSM) for banks 
under the aegis of the European Central Bank, 
served to calm the markets. Added to this, the 
crisis countries made visible progress towards 
improving their external position. On balance, 
financial transactions to and from Germany 
were partly influenced by countervailing devel-
opments during the fairly turbulent first six 
months of 2012 and the calmer second half of the year.
Portfolio investment
Amid a persistently very low turnover level on 
account of the crisis, portfolio investment, 
which as a rule is particularly quick to react to 
changes in sentiment on the financial markets, 
saw net capital exports amounting to €65½ 
billion last year, compared with net capital im-ports of €27 billion in 2011.
The swing in portfolio investment was predom-
inantly attributable to a marked lift in German 
investment abroad. Domestic investors pur -
chased foreign securities worth €108 billion net (2011: €22½ billion), with a particular emphasis 
on interest- bearing paper. German investors’ 
demand for fixed- interest securities from the 
rest of the euro area picked up again after 
plummeting in 2011; this led to net purchases 
in excess of €37 billion in 2012. Given the con-
siderably reduced yields available in Germany, institutional investors, in particular, demon
-
strated a growing interest in euro- area debt 
 securities. Above all, there was a strong de -
mand in Germany for bonds issued by the 
European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSF) 
(€23½ billion).
By contrast, purchases of foreign currency 
bonds issued by non- residents were very limited 
(€6 billion). Net demand was strongest for High net capital

 securities denominated in Danish krone and 
Swiss francs. Acquisitions of bonds denomin -
ated in US or Australian dollars, which had dominated purchasing activity in 2011, 
amounted to less than €½ billion in each case after deducting the corresponding sales.
Prompted by declining risk aversion, domestic 
investors showed a growing interest in foreign 
shares. They purchased equities worth €11 bil-
lion net in 2012, after offloading foreign shares 
on balance in 2011. The comparatively favour -
able share price trend prevailing in many for -
eign stock markets is likely to have contributed 
to this turnaround. This is also underlined by 
the regional breakdown of share purchases. All 
in all, investors sought to acquire shares in companies domiciled outside the euro area, 
which were less affected by the crisis within the 
euro area. Conversely, Spanish and Italian 
shares were sold on balance.
Aside from direct exposures to foreign equities, 
indirect investment in equities through foreign 
investment (asset management) companies 
probably also played a key role. In any case, 
across 2012 as a whole, German investors pur -
chased foreign mutual investment units to the 
tune of €21½ billion after close to balanced 
sales and purchases of these instruments in 2011.
In the reverse direction, foreign investors ac -
quired German securities worth just over €42 
billion in 2012, which was slightly less than in 
2011. However, at a volume of €79 billion, pur -
chases of public debt securities – €27 billion worth of which were issued by resolution agencies  – once again exceeded the already 
high net volume of such purchases in the pre-
ceding years of the crisis. This underscores 
how, in view of the further sovereign down -
grades of other countries by the big rating 
agencies, the search for safe havens remained 
a key criterion for foreign investors. The full-  
year outcome described above is, however, 
wholly attributable to the buoyant purchasing 
activity seen in the first five months of 2012, which then lost much of its steam in the second 
half of the year.
Unlike in the case of public debt securities, 
cross- border trading in private bonds and notes 
resulted in net sales and redemptions over the year as a whole (€26 billion). Foreign investors’ 
restraint in acquiring German private bonds 
with an original maturity of over one year was, however, not just demand- related but also sup-
ply- driven. Structural factors are partly behind 
this. For example, the outstanding volume of bank debt securities issued by residents has 
been waning for several years. Last year alone, this figure declined by around €100 billion.… and in for-

International investors also made net disposals 
of domestic money market paper (€8 billion). 
However, as with bonds, they drew a clear dis-
tinction between public and private issues. 
Hence, money market paper issued by the Fed-
eral government remained very much in de -
mand, whereas privately issued instruments 
were offloaded by foreign investors (or re -
deemed) on balance.
Cross- border turnover in German shares re -
ceded in 2012 as a result of the crisis. Seen over 
the year as a whole, foreign investors pur -
chased German equities for €1 billion net. 
However, this contrasted with an outflow of 
foreign capital from German mutual funds 
amounting to just under €4 billion. As a conse-
quence, the capital flow trends recorded in 
these two segments in 2011 underwent a com-
plete reversal in 2012.
Financial derivatives (which are aggregated to 
form a single item in the balance of payments) showed net capital exports, as in the two pre-
ceding years. At €18 billion, the 2012 outflow 
was somewhat lower than the prior- year level, 
however.
Direct investment
The financial and sovereign debt crisis, which has now been going on for several years, is clearly impinging on the direct investment 
 account as well. After expanding by one- sixth 
in 2011, global foreign direct investment (FDI) 
inflows declined by 18% to US$1½ trillion last 
year according to UNCTAD estimates.5 UNC -
TAD attributes this to macroeconomic fragility 
and policy uncertainty for investors. The impact 
consequently varied according to country 
group and region. The developed countries saw a drastic decline in inward direct invest
-
ment, with a majority of the euro- area coun -
tries experiencing particularly sharp falls. By 
contrast, foreign direct investment flows to the 
emerging and developing economies, which 
are at most only indirectly affected by the crisis in Europe and whose growth prospects are 
comparatively favourable, were only marginally 
down. On balance, the level of direct invest -
ment in developing countries surpassed inward 
FDI in the developed economies for the first 
time, according to UNCTAD data.
The cross- border direct investment activities of 
German enterprises abroad and those of non-  
resident enterprises in Germany developed 
along different lines in 2012. While German 
companies increased their foreign direct invest-
ment compared with 2011, foreign investors 
markedly reduced their investment in Germany. 
All things considered, direct investment flows to and from Germany resulted in net capital 
outflows of €47 billion in 2012.
The net outflow was primarily due to the cross- 
border activities of companies domiciled in 
Germany. While the magnitude of their foreign 
investment (€52 billion) surpassed the 2011 fig-ure, it was still well below the volume recorded in 2010. On the one hand, domestic enterprises 
supplied their foreign subsidiaries with add -
itional equity capital and strengthened their capital base by reinvesting earnings. On the other hand, German parent companies saw 
capital inflows in the form of intra- group credit 
transactions, whereby they borrowed on a 
large scale from their foreign affiliates (reverse 
flows).
The rising level of direct investment – also dur -
ing the crisis – underlines the significance for 
German firms both of foreign business and of 
maintaining a market presence abroad. In a 
survey conducted by the Association of Ger -
man Chambers of Commerce and Industry 
(DIHK) investigating the motives behind foreign 
investment, almost half of the respondent 
companies in 2012 specified the promotion of marketing and customer services as the driving … in domestic

Acquisition of real estate by non-residents in Germany
Non-residents’ acquisition of German real 
estate has recently been a recurring central 
topic of public debate. This has led to the 
impression that non-residents have been 
buying more and more property, especially 
in urban centres. The cross-border acqui-
sion of real estate is captured statistically in 
the German balance of payments. The 
available data do not support the assertion 
that buyers from other countries have 
stepped up their activities, however. Last year, non-resident owners
1 reduced their 
real estate portfolio by more than €0.8 bil-lion net. Recorded purchases of €0.7 billion contrasted with sales of just under €1.6 bil-
lion. This means there was no qualitative 
change in the situation compared with the 
previous year. In 2011, too, sales out-
weighed purchases (by €0.1 billion).
This was not always the case in the past. 
From 2006 to 2008, non-residents bought 
real estate in Germany on a major scale. Ac-quisition peaked in 2007 at €8.6 billion net. This involved transactions that were small in number, but on a very large scale. This was 
due, for one thing, to the privatisation of public housing stocks. For another, this 
period saw the sale of one big retail enter-
prise’s properties to a foreign asset man-
agement company. Within the same period, the 25 largest transactions alone accounted for almost two-thirds of the real estate ac-quired.
A look at the regional distribution of the (direct) buyers of real estate in Germany 
shows that most of them come from other countries in Europe. In this context, Luxem-bourg and the Netherlands traditionally play 
a signifi  cant role, not least as a result of 
transactions by the mutual funds and hold-ing companies domiciled there. Lately, there 
has been a moderate rise in purchases, from Russia and China in particular. For 
some years now, investors from the United 
States have been selling more than they have bought. For the United Kingdom and 
Denmark, this has been the case since 2008 and 2009 respectively.
All things considered, the volume of cross-border real estate transactions re-corded in the balance of payments has 
been rather small compared with the value 
of the stock of German real estate or the 
annual turnover of this sector. According to 
the overall balance sheet, the value of all 
real estate in Germany in 2011 amounted to 
€9.8 trillion,2 and sales on the German 
property market at the end of the period under review amounted to roughly €148 billion.
3 The share of purchases by non- 
residents was therefore just under ½% in 
mathematical terms.
Caution is nevertheless warranted in inter-
preting this fi  gure. Specifi  cally, there are a 
number of points in connection with the re-
cording of the balance of payments statis-
tics that have to be taken into consider-ation. For example, the acquisition of real 
estate by a non-German citizen residing in 
Germany or by an enterprise located in Ger-many, which is itself in foreign ownership, is deemed to be a domestic transaction and is 
not entered into the balance of payments. 
Actual cross-border acquisition of property 
is indeed to be reported by the resident buyer or seller from an exemption limit of 
€12,500 upwards. Despite this low report-
ing threshold, however, purchases (and sales) of real estate by non-residents are 
1 The deciding criterion, as in the balance of payments 
generally, is the buyer’s or seller’s place of residence or 
where the enterprise is offi   cially registered, not their 
nationality.2 Residential property, public and commercial real es-tate as well as building land.3 According to data from the report on the real estate 
market in 2011 by the working group of senior com-
mittees of surveyors in the Federal Republic of Ger-many. See Arbeitskreis der Gutachterausschüsse und Oberen Gutachterausschüsse in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, Immobilienmarktbericht 2011 (available

factor.6 While this objective gained in import -
ance compared with 2011, German enterprises 
were warier of the costly business of establish-ing production plants outside Germany. Of late, 
the acquisition of foreign enterprises played 
only a minor role in the expansion of German 
direct investment abroad.7
In 2012, German direct investment abroad was 
mainly concentrated on the industrial coun -
tries, which accounted for more than two-  
thirds of the total volume. This focus contrasted with the situation in 2011, when the emerging and developing countries were the main target. 
In the period under review, German direct in -
vestors’ interest within the euro area was pri -
marily focused on the Netherlands and Luxem-bourg. Both of these countries are major loca-
tions of international holding companies, 
meaning that the funds invested there do not 
have to remain within those countries’ national 
borders. Within Europe, additional investment 
was channelled to the United Kingdom. Out -side Europe, China was the most sought- after 
investment location. In terms of volume, Ger -
man private equity companies proved to be the 
biggest investors in 2012, followed by the 
 financial sector.
Unlike German proprietors, non- resident in -
vestors sharply scaled back their net direct in -
vestment in Germany from €35 billion in 2011 
to €5 billion in 2012. This drop reflects the 
global downturn in direct investment in the in-
dustrial economies that was described at the 
beginning of this section, although this is sur -
prising in Germany’s case because its economy has fared relatively well compared with the rest Regional and 
sectoral break-downForeign direct investment in Germanyprobably underreported in the data as the 
agencies responsible for collecting the data 
are scarcely able to identify instances of fail-ure to submit a report, especially in the case of resident private individuals. As a rule, the 
Bundesbank is able to ascertain failure to 
comply with the reporting requirement only in the case of large-scale transactions (by 
means of press analyses), while conducting separate examinations of the business activ-ity of large reporting bodies (banks, mutual 
funds, insurers) or in the context of plausi-
bility studies (comparing rent payments to 
non-residents with the reported purchases). 
For any additional measures to improve 
data quality, the Bundesbank is reliant upon 
the voluntary cooperation of others. To 
close the reporting gaps, it would be help-ful if fulfi  lment of the reporting requirement could be made part of the notarised docu-mentation process, for example.
Against this background, the now currently 
available data on non-residents’ purchases 
and sales of domestic real estate for 2012, 
as well of those of the past few years, 
should be regarded as the lower limit for 
the transactions that actually took place.Acquisition of real estate by

of Europe. While disinvestments and disposals 
lowered the amount of equity capital in for -
eign- owned German enterprises, reinvested 
earnings served to bolster their capital base.
The financial funds channelled to German en -
terprises predominantly came from parent 
companies in the United States, France and the 
Netherlands, and in each case were almost ex-
clusively provided via intra- group credit trans -
actions. Conversely, primarily investors based in Belgium and the United Kingdom withdrew dir -
ect investment from Germany on balance, with 
a strong focus on liquidating equity holdings. 
While German subsidiaries in the financial sec-
tor were supplied with additional funds, the domestic affiliates of foreign chemical com
-
panies were particularly affected by capital 
withdrawals.
Other investment
Other investment, comprising financial and trade credits (where these do not constitute 
direct investment) as well as bank deposits and 
other assets, saw net capital exports of €103 billion in 2012. However, the overall figure masks completely divergent developments in 
the first and second half of the year: while the 
January-  June period (excluding the change in 
TARGET2 balances) resulted in massive net cap-
ital imports owing to the high level of uncer -
tainty on the international financial markets, sizeable outflows of funds to the rest of the 
world occurred during the ensuing six months. 
In each case the TARGET2 balances moved in 
the opposite direction.
The cross- border transactions of domestic non- 
banks generated net capital outflows amount-
ing to €84 billion in 2012. Government entities, 
which accounted for €79 billion of this total, 
mainly increased their long and short- term ex-
ternal claims, but they also reduced their exter -
nal liabilities. The increase in claims was largely triggered by loans extended to Greece and, to 
a lesser extent, to Portugal and Ireland by the EFSF as well as by the increase in funding for 
the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which 
was executed in two tranches. The decline in 
external liabilities was attributable in no small 
part to transactions executed by FMS Wert -
management, a public resolution agency.8 En-
terprises and households recorded additional 
capital exports totalling €5 billion. This owed

financial enterprise that performs a central 
counterparty function in financial transactions.
Unsecuritised cross-  border activities within the 
banking system likewise resulted in net capital 
outflows However, credit institutions reported 
net inflows of funds worth €113½ billion. On 
the one hand, this was due to the fact that 
German institutions continued to deleverage, 
thereby reducing their unsecuritised foreign ex-posure by a further €62 billion in 2012, mainly 
shrinking their portfolio of long- term financial 
loans. On the other hand, the heightened un -
certainty in the euro area channelled large net 
inflows of funds from abroad to domestic banks (€51½ billion), especially at the begin
-
ning of the year.
In 2012, the Bundesbank recorded net capital 
exports of €132½ billion. As in previous years, 
these ultimately stemmed from transactions executed via the TARGET2 payment system. 
The TARGET2 balance grew by €192½ billion in 
the reporting period. However, the increase 
 occurred mainly in the first half of 2012 in the 
context of the escalating sovereign debt crisis, 
as already stated;9 at the end of the year, the 
balance was tending to fall a little. By contrast, 
moves by non- residents to augment their bal -
ances with the Bundesbank led to capital in -
flows in the amount of €60 billion. Besides the 
credit balances of the ESM and the EFSF, this mainly related to temporary deposits parked at the Bundesbank by other central banks.
Reserve assets
Transaction- related changes in the reserve 
assets are shown as a separate item in the bal-ance of payments. In 2012, these amounted to around €1½ billion on balance and were prin-
cipally the result of a slight increase in foreign 
currency reserves.
As in past years, the international reserve hold-
ings were also influenced by balance sheet ad-
justments which, in line with internationally agreed accounting standards, are not recog
-
nised in the balance of payments. The end- of- 
year revaluation of the reserve assets at market 
prices resulted in an increase of €2½ billion (2011: €19½ billion), due mainly to gains on 
gold. This result was, however, offset by an ex-
change rate-  related decline in the foreign cur -
rency reserves as well as in the reserve position 
in the IMF. All in all, Germany’s reserve assets 
rose by €4 billion in balance sheet terms to 
€188½ billion at the cut- off date of 31 Decem-

Banks’ internal methods for assessing and 
maintaining internal capital adequacy and their relevance to supervision
Capital adequacy as well as effective management of banks’ internal capital adequacy are mater-
ial preconditions for financial system stability. Supervisors therefore attach considerable import -
ance to ensuring internal capital adequacy. Germany’s internal capital adequacy requirements 
are based on the relatively small number of principles- based standards laid down in Pillar 2 of the 
2004 Basel II Framework. The core requirement to be met by institutions is the establishment of 
an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) with the goal of ensuring capital 
adequacy. Under the ICAAP, the institution is required to identify the material risk types, to quan-tify them using its own methods and to maintain adequate capital to back them; this capital must be of sufficient quality to absorb any losses that may arise. In order to maintain internal capital adequacy on an ongoing basis, it must be enshrined in banks’ decision- making processes, their 
business and risk strategies and their risk management and control processes. This requires the 
ICAAP to be, amongst other things, an integral part of banks’ limit systems and internal reporting frameworks.
As part of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP), banking supervisors regularly 
review and evaluate the suitability of banks’ methods and processes, as well as their capital 
adequacy. Experience has shown that the methodology of German credit institutions’ ICAAP has evolved significantly since 2004. However, there is still room for improvement – as a case in point, risks should be assessed in a more comprehensive, forward- looking manner than they have been 
up to now. Moreover, institutions should examine the limits of the methods used for quantifying risks more intensively. Supervisors have at their disposal a broad toolkit of measures for remedy-
ing potential deficiencies in the ICAAP; for example, they can order institutions to rectify meth -
odological or process- related deficits or can especially impose higher capital requirements.
As regards the ratio of available financial resources to risk, the deep scars left by the financial 
market crisis are currently still visible across institutions and groups of institutions. Although many institutions have recovered from the critical condition they were in at the height of the crisis, fur-ther efforts are still necessary to ensure that institutions’ internal capital adequacy remains sus-tainable in the long term.Deutsche Bundesbank

Ongoing dialogue between 
institutions and supervisors
Section 25a of the German Banking Act (Kredit -
wesengesetz) forms the legal basis for dialogue 
between institutions and supervisors on issues 
relating to business organisation and risk man-
agement. In the Minimum Requirements for 
Risk Management (Mindestanforderungen an 
das Risikomanagement), supervisors lay out 
the details of the provisions of that legislation. 
Many meetings with senior management, as well as on- site inspections, centre on the dis
-
cussion of banks’ internal capital adequacy ap-
proaches: in contrast to the much more highly 
norms- based approach of Pillar  1, the prin -
ciples- based design of the Pillar 2 requirements 
gives institutions great latitude in implementing 
the methods they are using. This freedom to 
choose their own methods initially made insti-
tutions quite visibly uncertain as to whether the design of their internal procedures would meet 
supervisory requirements. The publication of the paper, the English version of which is en
-
titled “Supervisory assessment of bank- internal 
capital adequacy concepts” (ICA Manual),1 in 
December 2011 provided the necessary trans -
parency regarding supervisory assessments and created a comprehensible, uniform framework 
for administrative actions. The Manual illus -
trated that supervisors, in their case- by- case as-
sessments, adhere to the precept of complete 
risk mapping, procedural consistency and the 
principle of prudence. Specifically, with regard 
to numerous frequently and hotly debated issues, the Manual drew a clear line between permissible discretionary scope in choosing 
methods and arbitrariness which leads to out -
comes that are no longer objectively verifiable.
The two most recent revised versions of the 
Minimum Requirements for Risk Management 
(2010 and 2012) also fleshed out the provisions 
governing internal capital adequacy. Institu -
tions’ uncertainty has receded markedly in the 
meantime. Dialogue between institutions and 
supervisors is ongoing because the ICAAP 
needs to be revised and adjusted regularly to accommodate changes in internal and external 
framework conditions.
This article will initially discuss the relationship 
between Pillar 1 and Pillar 2, before going into 
the fundamental approaches which exist in 
practice to assess and maintain internal capital adequacy and how, in these approaches, risk is quantified and the available financial resources 
(AFR) are determined. This article largely con -
fines itself to the methodological aspects con -
cerning the quantitative part of the ICAAP . A 
few examples of some of the methodological 
deficiencies in institutions’ management of in -
ternal capital adequacy frequently observed in 
supervisory practice will be described. This will 
be followed by a section on how supervisors 
deal with such flaws under the SREP .
Pillar 1 versus Pillar 2
Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 of the Basel Framework dif-
fer fundamentally in terms of their focus. The 
objective of Pillar 1 is to define internationally 
harmonised own funds requirements that cover 
as many institutions worldwide as possible. 
This regulatory perspective is complemented by 
Pillar  2, which follows a more individualised, but also more comprehensive, approach that 
looks at all risks and at the resources available to cover them.
To achieve an extensive standardisation of cap-
ital requirements under Pillar 1, supervisors fol-
low a rules- based supervisory approach which 
sets forth how credit institutions are to calcu -
late the required amount of own funds. Even where institutions decide to use internal risk 
measurement approaches approved by super -
visors, such approaches are guided to a large extent by supervisory rules and regulations. Pillar 1:  
extensive  standardisation

Monthly Report 
March 2013 30

Supervisors define not only counterparty credit 
risk, market risk and operational risk, the three 
types of risk to be included in the calculation, 
but also the own funds deemed appropriate to 
absorb losses; they also stipulate the overall 
amount of own funds to be held.
The standardised rules of Pillar 1 are intended 
to make own funds requirements internation -
ally comparable. However, these supervisory 
guidelines are limited in their ability to do just-ice to the vastly different risk situations of indi-vidual institutions. They are, therefore, supple-mented in Pillar 2 by institution- specific assess-
ments of capital and risk situations. It is primar -
ily the obligation of the institutions themselves to identify all material risks in a forward- looking 
holistic approach, to use appropriate methods 
to quantify them and to hold sufficient capital 
to back them. This, in principle, purely eco -
nomic view of risk and capital is obscured in 
practice, however, by the regulatory standards of Pillar 1 and accounting requirements, which likewise have to be fulfilled. Depending on indi-
vidual institutions’ preferences, the methods adopted range from the “Pillar  1 Plus ap
-
proach”, which merely supplements the Pillar 1 
calculation with risks and risk concentrations 
not covered under Pillar 1, to procedures which are largely divorced from the guidance given by Pillar 1 and accounting standards.
Under Pillar 2, institutions have very wide lati -
tude in the choice of methodology and are called upon to define suitable processes and 
procedures themselves, thus “pushing the en -
velope” of the Pillar  1 standardisation limits. 
Pursuant to the principle of proportionality, it is up to each individual institution to develop the methods and processes it uses in line with the 
nature, scope, complexity and riskiness of its 
activities. Institutions’ freedom to choose their own methodology ends wherever methods are 
applied arbitrarily and inconsistently, thus ren -
dering appropriate and effective risk manage -
ment impossible.A considered approach to risks is not only in 
the own best interests of any institution seek -
ing sustainability but is also the precondition for preventive banking supervision, which re
-
quires an undistorted view of institutions’ risk 
profiles. This is why supervisors examine 
whether every individual institution’s methods 
for assessing and maintaining internal capital 
adequacy are suitable, applying the principle of 
proportionality in doing so. Only if the material 
risks have been captured and mapped fully, the 
assumptions in the ICAAP are inherently con -
sistent and coherent and the ICAAP may be re-
garded as appropriate given the institution’s 
business activity will supervisors approve the 
procedures defined by the institution.
The two Basel Pillars differ not only in terms of 
the type of regulation, the comprehensive cov-
erage of all material risks and the transition 
from a supervisory to an institutional perspec -
tive, but also with regard to another major as-pect. Whereas the focus of Pillar 1 is on current 
business activity, under ICAAP institutions are 
required to factor in how changes in their own business activities as well as in their market en-
vironment could impact on risks and internal 
capital adequacy in future.
This pronounced forward- looking perspective, 
in conjunction with a holistic approach and the 
many methodological questions that require 
appropriate responses from credit institutions, 
make the ICAAP a major challenge.
Different approaches  
to assessing and maintaining internal capital adequacy
In practice, two fundamental approaches to as-
sessing and maintaining internal capital ad -
equacy used by institutions have evolved: going 
concern approaches and gone concern ap -
proaches. What both approaches have in com-
mon is that all of an institution’s material risks 
are measured and managed over a risk hori -
zon – usually one year. Strict risk measures and Pillar 2:

parameters assuming rare loss situations must 
also be used to quantify these risks. These cal-
culated risks are then offset against the AFR 
suited to covering losses that materialise. In 
addition to these similarities, there are consid -
erable differences in the fundamental thrust of 
the two approaches and the objectives that 
they each pursue.
The aim of going concern approaches is to en-
sure the institution’s survival even if losses 
occur over the risk horizon. Since such survival 
is predicated on the fulfilment of the Pillar 1 
regulatory own funds requirements, it is neces-
sary for institutions to set aside the requisite 
capital components for Pillar 1. This capital is 
consequently not available to absorb potential 
losses for internal capital adequacy purposes, 
which means that it cannot be part of the AFR.
By contrast, gone concern approaches do not 
focus on protecting proprietors but rather cred-itors. The aim of such approaches is that, even in extremis, ie if all of the risks factored into the 
management of internal capital adequacy ma -
terialise, the institution’s creditors can be paid 
from what is left of the institution’s assets, thus shielding them against losses. The fundamental 
assumption is not that liquidation will actually 
occur but, instead, that future losses which 
arise over the risk horizon may possibly lead to liquidation in the future.
Going concern and gone concern approaches 
are two different perspectives which are both 
suitable for ensuring internal capital adequacy. Rare losses are to be modelled in risk measure-ment in both approaches; in gone concern ap-
proaches, low- probability (but with a higher 
severity) events are captured since, in these ap-
proaches, no additional reserves are available to satisfy creditor claims beyond the AFR. By 
contrast, if going concern approaches are used 
and the risks which materialise are so great that they devour the AFR entirely, the capital 
needed to meet the regulatory minimum cap -
ital requirements is still available to fund any 
restructuring or resolution which might be ne-cessary. The possibility of saving capital by means of arbitrage between the two ap
-
proaches is, therefore, restricted.
It is natural that supervisors have an interest in 
both keeping institutions going and protecting 
creditors. They have, therefore, laid down this 
fundamentally desirable duality in the ICA Man-
ual and, since the 2012 revisions to the Min -
imum Requirements for Risk Management, have also enshrined therein the requirement 
that internal capital adequacy approaches must 
ensure both an institution’s ability to continue 
as a going concern and the protection of cred-
itors against economic losses.2 The internal 
capital adequacy toolkits of all institutions must 
take account of both objectives. Institutions 
choosing a gone concern approach must, at all 
events, set up supplementary procedures with 
which they can ensure compliance with the 
 Pillar 1 capital requirements since a gone con-
cern approach by itself is insufficient to achieve this objective. By contrast, for the numerous in-
stitutions applying a going concern approach, 
this approach may suffice on a stand- alone 
basis. However, an institution using the ap -
proach has to ensure that the capital set aside 
for compliance with the minimum capital re -
quirements is effectively available in full to sat-isfy creditors’ claims.
In practice, institutions’ internal capital ad -
equacy toolkits differ from one another not 
only with regard to these two fundamental ap-proaches but also in how the AFR are derived. 
A large percentage of institutions derive their AFR from balance sheet items or the P/L ac
-
count as part of their primarily management-  
related procedures; some institutions derive 
their AFR on the basis of full fair values. These 
two options for determining the AFR and the 
two basic internal capital adequacy approaches 
can be used to create four different combin -
ations, in theory.Going concern

It is methodologically consistent to derive the 
AFR in a balance- sheet- based manner in going 
concern approaches and on a full fair value 
basis in gone concern approaches. In these 
two cases, the method of determining the AFR 
is directly compatible with the basic internal 
capital adequacy approach. Going concern ap-
proaches are especially geared towards ensur -
ing long- term compliance with the Pillar 1 cap-
ital requirements. As the latter are derived from 
the balance sheet, it is only logical to base the 
definition of the AFR on balance sheet items. In 
gone concern approaches, however, the issue 
at stake is the institution’s capital in the case of 
a notional liquidation. As this capital that can 
be used to satisfy creditor claims corresponds 
exactly to the value of the institution’s assets, 
determining the AFR using full fair value criteria is consistent in such approaches.
Using balance sheet values as the basic vari -
ables in a gone concern approach initially rep-
resents a methodological inconsistency. The only way to establish consistency with the 
underlying idea behind the approach is to ad -
just these values adequately, and ultimately to 
calculate the enterprise’s present value indir -
ectly. Supervisors are aware of the methodo -
logical complexity faced by institutions using 
this approach. The assessment of such an ap -
proach hinges crucially on the impact of these 
methodological inconsistencies on how in -
ternal capital adequacy is determined.
What is likewise methodologically problematic 
is a combination of determining the AFR on a 
full fair value basis and a going concern ap -
proach, since compliance with the Pillar 1 cap-
ital requirements is, in this case, no longer a 
given. The reason for this is that the Pillar 1 cap-
ital requirements are based on balance sheet 
values, while the AFR in the internal capital ad-equacy plan are derived from the present value. Practice has shown that it is impossible to find a 
consistent method of reconciliation in such 
cases. Such approaches, therefore, require the 
creation of an additional, methodologically con-sistent risk management steering approach.Risk types and quantification 
of risk
The measurement and management of all ma-
terial risks first requires a risk inventory, ie a full stocktake of the risks to which an institution is exposed. In such an inventory, institutions gen-
erally capture, at the very least, counterparty credit risk, market risk (including interest rate 
risk in the banking book), operational risk and 
risk concentrations. However, the risk of a rise 
in funding costs remains insufficiently ac -
counted for in many cases. Additional types of 
risk that tend to be more difficult to quantify, 
such as strategic risk, business risk and reputa-
tional risk, are measured using scenario ana -
lyses by methodologically advanced institutions 
and, otherwise, are often included through a 
lump- sum amount covering other risks. As Ger -
man credit institutions’ business models are highly heterogeneous, the Minimum Require
-
ments for Risk Management can provide only 
general examples of material risks. Owing to a 
lack of generally applicable definitions for the 
other types of risk, institutions face the task of 
independently identifying their risks in a com -
prehensive and clear manner. Institutions need 
to have such flexibility, too, in order to delin -
eate those risk types which are consistent with their internal management philosophy.
Although the choice of the appropriate method 
of risk measurement should be made according to the principle of proportionality, this principle 
can play only an extremely limited role in the actual application of a certain risk measure
-
ment method, however. If an institution with 
manageable, simple and low-  risk business ac -
tivities opts for an advanced method of quanti-fying risk, it cannot put forward its small size or 
the low complexity of its business with regard 
to the benchmarks for the method’s applica -
tion. Instead, what proportionality means here is that this institution, too, is required to meet the demanding prerequisites and conditions for the proper use of its chosen risk quantification method.Consistent

This can be illustrated particularly well in the 
example of using credit portfolio models to measure counterparty credit risk (see the box 
on page 35). Whereas large, methodologically 
advanced institutions are more likely to be in a 
position to meet the extensive requirements and to procure the resources needed to ad
-
equately apply, parameterise and validate a 
credit portfolio model, small and medium- sized 
institutions often have problems with the  critical analysis of risk quantification methods 
 required by the Minimum Requirements for 
Risk Management. Institutions must always be 
aware of the limits of a complex method which 
result, above all, from simplifying model as -
sumptions and from the underlying data used 
to estimate the parameters. The Bundesbank’s on- site inspections of banking operations have 
shown that many banks have not yet subjected their key model assumptions, input data quality or model results to sufficient critical review. In-
stitutions which lack adequate risk manage -
ment resources to fulfil the required precondi -
tions for using complex models have either to 
build up the methodological expertise needed 
for complex methods or to choose more simple methods commensurate with the limited scope of their business activities and risk situation, the 
appropriate application of which they can 
guarantee.
A further challenge facing institutions is how to 
adequately capture credit spread risk and mi -
gration risk. The credit spread, as a risk pre -
mium for credit risk exposures to the risk- free 
and maturity- matched interest rate, also con -
tains expected migrations, and so it is impos -
sible to avoid overlap entirely when determin -
ing credit spread risk and migration risk in risk 
measurement. Consequently, institutions can 
adjust the value- at- risk (VaR) to be recognised 
for internal capital adequacy purposes to factor 
in this overlap. However, this procedure must 
be supported vis- à- vis supervisors through a 
well- founded approach which also takes due 
account of the stability of the effect over time. 
Supervisory practice has shown that the methods used by institutions for this purpose usually fail to fulfil these requirements at 
present.
When quantifying market risk, German institu-
tions use established methods with which they 
have accumulated experience across various market phases. Although these methods en
-
abled reliable risk management in the past, 
they came up short in the financial market cri-
sis. When integrating complex products into market risk measurement, too, the methods used often show material deficiencies. The 
Minimum Requirements for Risk Management 
therefore embody the principle that, prior to 
purchasing or issuing such complex products 
for the first time, institutions must already con-
sider how to model them in their risk manage-
ment and risk control processes. This also ap -
plies to mutual fund investments which need to be transparent through to the individual positions in order to be recognised by super
-
visors. The box on the risk horizon on page 37 
discusses the methodological hurdles to inte -
grating market risk into internal capital ad -
equacy approaches.
Interest rate risk in the banking book has a par -
ticular significance for many institutions owing 
to its concentration in lending and deposit 
business and the associated maturity trans -
formation, which is economically important. 
The methods and procedures chosen to meas-ure and manage interest rate risk in the  banking 
book must be consistent with the internal cap-
ital adequacy management approach.  Either 
accounting- based approaches or present value 
approaches can be used. The present value 
 effects on own funds of a sudden, unexpected 
shift in interest rates of ±200 basis points 
 already have to be calculated and reported to 
supervisors pursuant to Circular 11/2011 (BA).3

Managing counterparty credit risk with credit portfolio 
models
For many credit institutions, credit portfolio 
models are a key tool for quantifying and man-
aging their counterparty credit risk exposure. 
As can be expected, these are chiefl  y large 
credit institutions which use advanced method-
ologies. However, a large number of savings 
banks and credit cooperatives, too, are opting 
to deploy systems developed within their re-
spective associations.
Credit portfolio models serve to quantify po-tential unexpected losses within the risk hori-zon, ie losses that exceed expected levels. In these models, comprehensive simulations or 
analytical approximations are conducted so as 
to determine the probability distribution of fu-
ture creditworthiness- related changes in the 
value of the credit portfolio. Depending on the 
type of model used, the observed movements 
in value might be changes either in the present 
values or in the balance sheet valuations of credit risk positions owing to the accounting standards used. The values in question must, 
however, be consistent with the methodology 
of the institution’s management approach.
For many credit institutions, value- at- risk (VaR) 
is still the only risk measure used for quantify-
ing the unexpected loss. Alternative risk meas-
ures, such as the expected shortfall (ES), have 
not yet gained a foothold in the banking indus-try. VaR designates the potential loss which will not be exceeded with a certain degree of prob-
ability (namely, the chosen confi  dence level) and thereby completely disregards the poten-tial loss above this threshold. ES, meanwhile, denotes the loss that is expected to occur if 
VaR is exceeded. The established models used 
within the banking industry, which are mostly 
based on approaches known from the litera-
ture such as Credit Metrics, CreditPortfolioView 
or Credit Risk+, differ conceptually in terms of 
the aspects of counterparty credit risk they 
model, their underlying assumptions regarding the distribution of the number of defaults and 
the loss given default (LGD). However, the 
commonly used approaches all assume condi-
tionally independent default or migration 
events.Inputs not only include the relevant position 
data but also, depending on the model in ques-tion, a wide variety of parameters which need 
to be estimated appropriately. These param-eters include default and migration probabil-ities, the LGD and its distribution parameters, 
cash fl  ow structures for the individual positions 
and discount rates that adequately refl  ect risk 
and, fi  nally, correlation parameters. A number 
of models source some of these inputs from 
complex pre- processing systems.
Many institutions have found that the raw data 
remain the most signifi  cant obstacle to apply-
ing the model properly. Where the majority of 
German institutions have made the greatest 
strides is in estimating parameters such as probabilities of default (PD) and LGD, which also form part of the Internal Ratings- Based 
(IRB) approach. However, owing to the require-
ments for the length of the time series, the 
greatest challenge lies, as hitherto, in defi  ning 
the correlation parameters, particularly so if 
they are to be estimated on the basis of default data.
Much like the IRB approaches introduced by Pillar 1, pooling solutions are likewise com-monly used in credit portfolio models. They 
offer the advantage of reducing the time and 
effort involved in developing and maintaining 
the systems, and of expanding the meagre raw data. It should, however, be borne in mind that 
a meaningful estimation of parameters is only 
possible if the input data and the underlying credit processes are adequately transferable. 
The fi  rst diffi   culties arise in uniformly defi  ning 
and recording defaults and losses as well as 
comparable procedures for determining collat-
eral value. Many other questions also need to 
be tackled, such as whether the same correl-
ations can be used for credit portfolios in differ-ent regions. Addressing such problems notably 
necessitates a comprehensive and prudent 
quantitative and qualitative validation by insti-
tutions and model developers alike. Further-
more, the parties involved and supervisors need 
to engage in an intensive dialogue in order to 
facilitate an appropriate assessment.Deutsche Bundesbank

should also cover other scenarios apart from 
this interest rate shock. In most cases, it is 
probably not enough to capture only a parallel shift in the yield curve.
Operational risk, too, is a material risk for most 
institutions. The very recent cases of losses 
caused by legal risk and internal fraud show 
the need to tackle this type of risk not only at a 
procedural level but also by reserving capital 
within an internal capital adequacy framework. 
Following a clarification to this effect in the 2009 version of the Minimum Requirements for Risk Management,
4 nearly all institutions 
factor operational risk into their internal capital adequacy plans as a material risk.
Institutions generally identify the existence of 
additional types of risk above and beyond the 
“classic” risks already mentioned. They define 
these risks very differently, however. Occasion-
ally, additional risks are recorded as a sub-  
category of another type of risk (such as part of 
operational risk). For additional types of risk, 
too, institutions are required to use a risk inven-
tory to determine whether they are material 
within the meaning of the Minimum Require -
ments for Risk Management. If they are, insti -
tutions have to ensure that these risks, like the 
other material risks, are properly modelled in their internal capital adequacy assessments. Supervisors are aware that not all institutions 
have fully perfected methods or sufficient raw 
data to quantify these risks for now. However, 
the complete omission of the relevant risks 
from the internal capital adequacy framework 
for this reason is not an option; rather, in such 
cases, it is necessary to set aside a lump sum based on a plausibility check. The plausibility 
check can be conducted, for example, using a 
qualified expert assessment or by means of 
stress tests. Should it be impossible to include 
individual types of risk in the internal capital ad-
equacy framework owing to their specific na -
ture, the institution must plausibly substantiate 
any exclusion. This concerns, for instance, li -
quidity risk in the narrower sense, which in -
cludes the threat of insolvency. By contrast, re-financing risk, ie the risk arising from increased 
funding costs, needs to be factored into the 
internal capital adequacy framework if it is ma-terial owing to its potential to cause losses and negative effects on the present value. Irrespect-ive of inclusion in the internal capital adequacy 
framework, institutions need to cover all risks adequately in their risk management and risk 
control processes.
The Minimum Requirements for Risk Manage -
ment stipulate that, based on the overall risk 
profile, institutions must make sure that mater -
ial risks are constantly covered by AFR, thus en-
suring internal capital adequacy. For this pur -
pose, the contributions of the various material 
risks need to be aggregated consistently and systematically into an overall risk and offset 
against the AFR.
In the past, risk-reducing diversification effects 
between risk types factored into institutions’ 
internal capital adequacy approaches have often proved to be insufficiently robust when the risk event actually materialised. In fact, Bundesbank analyses show that, especially in 
times of economic strain, contagion effects can cause overall risk to exceed the sum of individ-
ual risks. Supervisors’ expectations regarding the factoring in of diversification effects were 
already incorporated into the 2010 revision of 
the Minimum Requirements for Risk Manage -
ment. Risk-reducing diversification effects must 
accordingly be based on assumptions stem -
ming from an analysis of an individual institu -
tion’s circumstances, be calculated on the basis 
of representative data and be estimated con -
servatively enough to be assumed to be suffi -
ciently stable even in economic downturns and 
under unfavourable market conditions. Recent 
findings from practical experience show that 
those few institutions seeking to claim diversifi-
cation effects between risk types fail by not 
providing empirical evidence of the presumed Operational risk

Risk horizon
The aim of all processes to ensure internal cap-
ital adequacy is to safeguard the institution’s via-
bility over the entire risk horizon, which is usually 
set at one year for all types of risk.
In the fi  eld of market risk, this means that, even 
if the holding period for individual positions is 
shorter due to trading or temporary closing out, 
overall AFR utilisation must not exceed the AFR 
allocated to such risk as a whole for the entire 
risk horizon. Because this economic principle 
was often disregarded by institutions, super-
visors clarifi  ed the issue in No 95 of the ICA 
Manual.
For banking practice, this means that holding 
periods can be less than 250 trading days and 
that such an assumption can be in line with an 
economic view over a one- year horizon. How-ever, if holding periods are assumed to be 
shorter than the internal capital adequacy as-
sessment horizon, institutions must make appro-
priate assumptions as to how their market risk 
will evolve throughout the remainder of the risk 
horizon. The chart below shows several proced-
ures to consistently map the holding period to the risk horizon seen in practice. The most fre-
quently used procedure is to scale the risk of in-
dividual positions to a one- year horizon. Meth-
odologically advanced institutions attempt to 
model their concrete limit structure, recognition and response times, market liquidity aspects and 
the trading strategies pursued in a simulation. 
Based on the Pillar 1 process of using the incre-
mental risk charge to measure default and mi-
gration risk, institutions can also use the under-lying “constant level of risk” methodology.
A fi  nal possibility would be to assume deleverag-
ing (or hedging) before the end of the risk hori-
zon. This scenario implies an abrupt reduction or 
termination of business and therefore requires close analysis of the institutions’ own business 
models and sources of income. Institutions 
would have to justify such less- than- conservative 
assumptions not only theoretically but also 
based on real- world situations. Recent experi-
ence from the fi  nancial market crisis raises 
doubts concerning the necessary will and eco-
nomic ability of many market participants to use such a procedure.
Four methods of integrating market risk into a standardised risk horizon
Deutsche BundesbankRisk horizon (internal capital adequacy) of one year– Complete deleveraging before the end of the risk horizon (exception):
Risk is reduced or hedged long before the end of the risk horizon, resulting in a loss of potential earnings.– Simulation:
Realistic portfolio shifts during the risk horizon are included, as are anticipated measures by the institution if the current risk level
exceeds a previuosly defined risk limit (limit breach).– Scaling risk for individual positions to 250 trading days:
Individual positions in a portfolio are assumed to remain unchanged over the entire risk horizon and the value at risk, measured on the
basis of a shorter holding period, is multiplied by a given factor.
– Constant level of risk:
New investment in individual positions of similar risk following the sale of the original positions is assumed.

diversification. Supervisors therefore see this as 
a vindication of their restrictive approach.
Available financial resources
The volume and composition of the AFR are closely connected to the approach chosen to ensure internal capital adequacy. Institutions 
choosing a gone concern approach can include in the AFR all capital components which would absorb losses in the assumed case of a poten-
tial liquidation. By contrast, the definition of 
the AFR for institutions using a going concern 
approach is based on the concept of “own funds” originating in Pillar 1 (implemented in 
Germany through the Solvency Regulation (Sol-
vabilitätsverordnung)). Therefore, for the pur -
poses of internal risk management, at most 
only that part of capital left over after deduct-
ing prudential capital requirements and avail -
able in a going concern may serve as AFR.
In connection with the balance sheet method 
of deriving the AFR, experts have devoted par -
ticularly intense discussion to how to deal with 
expected earnings from already contracted 
business and with hidden losses. In going con-cern approaches, the practice of also using po-
tentially loss- absorbing components of pro -
jected earnings to offset quantified risks is widespread. There is initially an inconsistency 
between an internal capital adequacy approach 
which rests entirely on currently available cap -
ital – as is, by the way, also the case in the pru-dential Pillar 1 – and regarding expected asset growth as a suitable buffer for the materialisa-
tion of risks. In the context of the economic 
view in Pillar 2, however, it can be acceptable 
to recognise conservatively calculated earnings 
components in the AFR when using going con-
cern approaches. Conservative calculation is 
predicated on appropriate recognition of po -
tential fluctuations in earnings, for example, by applying suitable haircuts or by explicitly mod-elling business risk.Whatever management procedure they choose, institutions have to deal with the hidden losses resulting from the discrepancy between market 
values and balance sheet values in their ac -
counting. Hidden losses signal a mismatch be-tween balance sheet valuation and the current 
economic situation. Following the logic of a 
gone concern approach, it is absolutely impera-
tive for hidden losses to be factored into in -
ternal capital adequacy, as either a risk-  
increasing or an AFR- reducing component, in 
order to ensure that the desired goal of cred -
itor protection can be met at all times. With 
respect to going concern approaches, by con -
trast, hidden losses do not have to be factored 
in initially if the institution has, without any 
doubt, the will and ability to hold to maturity 
and the assumed reinstatement of value is 
guaranteed. However, Pillar 2 goes above and 
beyond the definition of methodologically con-
sistent approaches to pursue, above all, the aim of an economic view of institutions’ in
-
ternal capital adequacy. The Minimum Require-ments for Risk Management therefore demand 
not only that the limits and constraints arising 
from the methodologies and procedures used 
are made visible but also, explicitly, that credit-ors are protected against losses. It is, therefore, only logical to require institutions with consid-erable hidden losses to also factor these losses 
into their going concern approaches for in -
ternal capital adequacy purposes if a manage-
ment- relevant gone concern approach, in 
which hidden losses need to be factored in per 
se, has not been implemented at the same time. The ICA Manual throws light on how supervisors expect hidden losses to be dealt 
with in terms of methodology.
Following the economic approach of Pillar 2, 
there is a symmetrical relationship between 
hidden losses and hidden reserves. In balance- 
sheet- based approaches, the latter can, in prin-
ciple, be assigned to the AFR. However, super -
visors expect institutions to take due account of the imponderables and limits of unlocking 
hidden reserves within the internal capital ad -
equacy approach used by the institution.Components

Capital planning
Through the call for material risks to be covered 
by AFR, capital planning has become an indis-
pensable element of securing internal capital adequacy over the medium to long term. 
Supervisors have accordingly set requirements 
for a forward- looking multi- year capital plan -
ning process as an addition to the internal cap-
ital adequacy plan (with its horizon of usually one year), thereby underscoring institutions’ 
obligation and responsibility to ensure regula -
tory and internal capital adequacy.
In the capital planning process, institutions 
must identify their regulatory and internal cap-
ital requirements in a timely manner and take 
appropriate measures to cover the require -
ments at an early stage, even in an unfavour -
able environment. Since an analysis such as 
multi-  year capital planning which stretches far 
into the future is fraught with all sorts of uncer -
tainties, the capital planning process does not 
need to be as all- encompassing as the internal 
capital adequacy analysis and, instead, often 
ends up becoming more of a rough estimate of capital requirements above and beyond the in-
ternal capital adequacy horizon. Institutions 
must include changes in their own business ac-
tivities, strategic objectives and the economic environment as key aspects of their capital planning. Unexpected, adverse developments 
also need to be included in capital planning in order to increase institutions’ sensitivity to crit-
ical situations and to give them the necessary 
management stimuli. Various scenarios should 
accordingly also look at those developments 
which deviate from expectations and assump -
tions in the planning processes.
A forward- looking capital planning process is 
not only international standard practice but is, particularly also at major German credit institu-tions, an integral part of medium- term business 
planning and the basis for fundamental stra -
tegic thinking. Institutions are not capitalising 
fully on the option of using capital planning for 
medium to long-  term risk analysis, too, from which they can obtain management stimuli for 
their risk situation. It has continued to be 
shown in practice that not all institutions at -
tach adequate importance to potentially ad -
verse developments in their capital planning 
and, therefore, do not take sufficient account 
of limiting factors when raising capital.
In practice, the capital planning is usually put into operation for regulatory capital require
-
ments through a definition of minimum capital 
ratios (such as the tier 1 capital ratio); for in -
ternal capital requirements, it is done through a 
definition of minimum risk coverage ratios to ensure internal capital adequacy. Owing to 
their standardisation and comparability, regula-
tory capital ratios are increasingly coming to 
the attention of external observers such as the 
European Banking Authority (EBA) or rating 
agencies. Institutions must ensure that they meet the requirement stipulated in the Min
-
imum Requirements for Risk Management of 
giving equal and adequate treatment to regula-
tory capital requirements and internal capital 
requirements in their capital planning process.
Prudential measures  
in the SREP
Alongside the ICAAP requirements that institu-
tions must meet, Pillar 2 of the Basel Frame -
work contains a second key element: in the 
SREP , supervisors have to look intensively at in-
dividual institutions’ methodologies, processes, 
procedures and strategies and to assess their 
suitability with regard to ensuring internal cap-
ital adequacy over the long term. German supervisors are convinced that the SREP must 
be based on an analysis and assessment of the 
institution’s own information and methodolo -
gies as well as the risk metrics derived from 
them. The institutions themselves ought to be 
best placed to know and evaluate their risks. 
However, this in no way means that supervisors rely solely on the institutions’ figures and meth-odologies. Rather, they subject this information 
to intense scrutiny and, in their assessments, Commitment to

take into account deficiencies in institutions’ 
methodologies and processes. Supervisors are 
attaching growing importance to data storage 
and management information systems as cen -
tral prerequisites for a functioning risk manage-
ment framework and will also increasingly 
shine a spotlight on these factors when assess-
ing the ICAAP .5
Under the SREP , supervisors also take appropri-
ate prudential action to remedy deficiencies in 
institutions’ individual risk measurement and risk management practices. In total keeping 
with the preventive, qualitative character of Pil-
lar 2, German supervisors have always held that 
deficiencies identified in an institution’s risk 
management have to be rectified in a timely 
manner. Experience in the area of internal mar -
ket risk models, for instance, has also shown that imposing accompanying capital add- ons 
provides an incentive for institutions to remedy 
deficiencies in methodologies or processes 
quickly. Moreover, in these cases, the additional 
capital can be used to absorb potential losses 
caused by process- related deficits. It is addition-
ally a risk mitigant as this capital cannot be used 
to back new business. The use of capital add-  
ons makes sense particularly as long as deficien-cies exist which impact directly on internal cap-ital adequacy, such as not factoring in all risks.
Based on this experience and thinking, German 
supervisors are already applying capital add-  
ons more frequently than before and intend, in 
future, to use this instrument systematically, 
but without abandoning their fundamental 
focus on the quality of processes. Supervisors 
are not planning to implement a supervisory 
risk measurement model. Their goal, rather, is 
for institutions to holistically identify, measure 
and manage their risks in the ICAAP independ-
ently and out of their own economic self-  
interest: after all, a functioning internal risk 
management system is a key factor in the sta-bility of the banking system.
However, with regard to Pillar 2, German super -
visors are operating within an increasingly Europeanised regulatory framework. The EBA 
has already published guidelines on ICAAP-  
related issues in the past. It is additionally working on guidelines to harmonise Pillar  2 
supervisory processes. These efforts also need 
to be seen in connection with the forthcoming 
Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) to be domiciled at the European Central Bank. The 
national Pillar 2 supervisory processes still vary 
considerably across Europe at present. Many 
countries are pursuing something more akin to a “Pillar 1 Plus approach”, in which the SREP is 
designed to quantify risks not captured by  Pillar  1 with the help of supervisory models, 
and to impose capital add- ons on institutions. 
It is currently impossible to say how the Euro -
pean convergence efforts will impact on the 
SREP for German institutions.
Conclusions and outlook
In the past few years, institutions have made 
great strides towards consistent procedures for 
ensuring internal capital adequacy. Supervisors 
have observed that greater consistency in de -
riving the AFR has meanwhile been achieved across the entire banking sector. The discus
-
sions held during on- site inspections of bank -
ing operations and normal meetings with se -
nior management therefore nowadays hardly touch upon basic methodological issues but 
cover, above all, detailed issues specific to indi-vidual institutions, as well as the integration of 
internal capital adequacy methodologies into 
business and risk management processes.
Owing to the general freedom to choose methods, a wide variety of risk measurement 
and risk management procedures exist. Unlike 
with regard to the composition of the AFR, it is much more difficult to set forth universally ap-plicable basic methodological considerations in this area. In the past few years, the events dur -Measures in the

ing the financial market crisis, the intensive dia-
logue between institutions and supervisors and the extensive allocation of institutions’ internal 
capacities have caused the internal capital ad -
equacy management practices of German insti-
tutions to evolve significantly; these practices 
hold up well in a comparison with the rest of 
the world, too.
Institutions’ toolkits are now in much better shape than before the financial market crisis. However, institutions still have some catching 
up to do with regard to reflecting critically on 
the limits and constraints of risk quantification 
methods. What supervisors expect of institu -
tions above all is that they examine more closely the fact that, while risks are always forward- looking, many of the risk quantifica
-
tion methods used are still mostly or exclusively backward- looking.Whereas there has been progress regarding in-ternal capital adequacy methods on the whole, 
in terms of the ratio of AFR to risk the deep scars caused by the financial market crisis are 
still clearly visible across institutions and groups of institutions alike. Each individual institution’s internal capital adequacy situation depends not 
only on the efforts of the institutions them -
selves and of supervisors but, not least, also on 
future developments in the financial markets. For institutions, this uncertainty means that they must work to improve their capital base 
on a long- term and sustainable basis while, at 
the same time, pressing on with forward-  
looking risk measurement. Supervisors, for their 
part, are called upon to create internationally 
comparable requirements and to demand com-parable capital levels for similar or equal risks.Progress in
