Economy as a wholeIn the summer months, output again showed
only a slight increase. According to the initialcalculations of the Federal Statistical Office,real gross domestic product (GDP) in the thirdquarter, after adjustment for seasonal andworking-day variations, was 0.3% up on thepreceding three-month period. Growth wasthus roughly in line with that of the two pre-ceding quarters. Adjusted for working-dayvariations, the figure was 0.4% up on theyear. The corresponding calendar-month fig-ure was +0.9%.
In terms of domestic demand, households’
consumption picked up in particular. The re-tail trade benefited very little from this, how-ever, while the motor vehicle trade flourished.There was a perceptible increase in thenumber of new car registrations. By contrast,business investment in both machinery andequipment and in buildings showed a furtherdecline with a year-on-year fall of 7
12% and
around 612%, respectively. There was a
marked expansion in exports. Despite a sharprise in imports, net exports provided a slightlypositive contribution to growth.
IndustryBusiness developments in industry did be-
come less favourable in early autumn. Thecauses of this were not only cyclical, however.The public holidays and days taken off workto make up a long weekend (known as“bridge days”), which have a marked damp-Overall output

6ening effect on production, were also a major
factor. According to the provisional officialstatistics, seasonally adjusted output in Octo-ber was perceptibly down on the level of thepreceding months.
The intake of industrial orders, which is much
less affected by the number of “bridge days”,showed a clear improvement in October. Sea-sonally adjusted new orders were a good
34% higher than on an average of the pre-
ceding quarter. The year-on-year figure, at4
14%, showed a rise which was far sharper
than it had been in the third quarter (some-what more than 1%).
There was an increase especially in domestic
demand, which was a seasonally adjusted1
12% up on the average of the July to Sep-tember period. For the first time in one and a
half years, a year-on-year increase of 112%
was achieved. There was an expansion inorders in all the major sectors, ranging fromintermediate to consumer goods industries.By contrast, seasonally adjusted new exportorders stagnated at a level which, at the endof the period under review, was around 8%up on the year.
ConstructionThe situation in the construction sector re-
mained depressed in the past few months.The seasonally adjusted level of orders re-ceived did, in fact, go up somewhat in Sep-tember. When taken together with the twopreceding months, however, new orderswere just over 3% down again on the secondquarter, which had already brought a nega-tive development. The figure was almost 6%lower than in the comparable period of 2001.
Despite a slight improvement in September,
all three construction subsectors were tend-ing to show a decline in business. While thefall in public sector construction – seasonallyadjusted and on a quarterly basis – was stillcomparatively moderate at 1
14%, residential
construction again suffered a loss of no lessthan 8
14%.
There was a further marked fall in construc-
tion output in October. Taking into accountthe fact that the results of this year’s overallsurvey, with its sharp upward revision for themonths from March to September, have notyet been included, the current seasonally ad-Real GDP

7justed broad level of parity between Septem-
ber and October becomes a sharp fall.
Labour marketThe situation on the labour market has deteri-
orated over the past weeks. There has been afurther sharp reduction in employment andthe rise in unemployment has accelerated.According to the calculations of the FederalStatistical Office, the number of persons inwork in September fell to a seasonally adjust-ed 38.56 million, ie around 45,000 fewerthan in August and not quite 340,000, or0.9%, fewer than one year before. In mid-year, the decline had been 0.6%.
The seasonally adjusted number of persons
registered as unemployed with the FederalLabour Office rose to 4.16 million at the endof November. Compared with September,when a period of temporary stagnationended, this signifies an increase of around60,000. This gives a year-on-year rise of over235,000. The unemployment rate, as calcu-lated by the labour exchanges, went up to10.0%; the corresponding figure using inter-national methods rose to 8.4%, comparedwith 8.3% in the previous five months.
PricesAfter accelerating for a short time, the rate of
consumer price increase slowed down againin November. In seasonally adjusted terms,prices fell back to their early-spring level. Theyear-on-year rate, which had risen to 1.3% inOctober, went down to 1.1%.Economic conditions in Germany*

8This dampening of prices was due, not least,
to seasonal foodstuffs, refined petroleumproducts and package holidays. Price adjust-ments in the case of industrial goods werealso moderate.
In seasonally adjusted terms, import prices,
whose most recent low had been in July, hadbeen rising well into October, however. Forthe first time in some while, they were alsoshowing a slight year-on-year increase again.In the case of industrial producer prices, too,the upward trend continued well into Octo-ber and, at the end of the period underreview, they were likewise somewhat higherthan 12 months previously.
Public finance
Indebtedness of central, state and local
government
In October the indebtedness of central, state
and local government expanded sharply by37.2 billion after increasing by 32.3 billion in
September. However, the liabilities of centralgovernment went up only by 31.9 billion.
Whereas the volume of its outstandingmoney market loans rose by 31.1 billion up to
end-October, its net inflows from the capitalmarket amounted to 30.8 billion. The Federal
Government raised 35.6 billion from the sale
of two-year Federal Treasury notes (Schätze);this was chiefly attributable to the topping-up of the September issue by 34.3 billion. In
addition, five-year Federal notes (Bobls) weresold to the net value of 30.6 billion. By con-
trast, the outstanding volume of long-termFederal bonds (Bunds) fell by 33.7 billion. The
proceeds from the topping-up of the ten-yearBund launched in July 2002 ( 36.7 billion) and
the income yielded by market managementoperations ( 31.4 billion) were offset by con-
siderably higher redemptions ( 311.8 billion),
including the repayment of a TreuhandAgency bond and a Federal Railways bond.Significant net redemptions were also record-ed for Federal savings notes (- 31.7 billion).
The growth of state government debt accel-
erated markedly in October. After procuring atotal of 317.6 billion in the first three quar-
ters, 34.9 billion was recorded for net bor-
rowing in October. Short-term cash advancesfrom banks and the issue of Treasury noteseach accounted for almost half of the netborrowing requirement ( 32.4 billion). The vol-Net borrowing in the market

9ume of loans against borrowers’ notes re-
mained virtually unchanged. The largest sin-gle issue among the Land Governments was
a four-year floating-rate bond amounting to31.5 billion launched by the state of Lower
Saxony. The trend of bond issues denomin-ated in foreign currencies continued in Octo-ber: the state of Hesse announced that itraised CHF 0.5 billion and also issued a bondamounting to NOK 0.5 billion. The liabilitiesof those special funds not integrated intocentral government debt went up marginallyby30.1 billion.
Federal Government borrowingIn November the Federal Government ex-
panded its net indebtedness by 35.8 billion,
drawing almost exclusively on the capitalmarket. Overall, it had raised 334.8 billion net
(actual cash inflow) on the capital market bythe end of November, whereas it was only au-thorised to borrow 321.1 billion in the whole
of 2002. Since its borrowing is now far high-er, the Federal Government has adopted asupplementary budget which will raise theauthorised level of net borrowing this year by313.5 billion to 334.6 billion.
1The rise in bor-
rowing in the last quarter of 2002 is reflected,in particular, in the topping-up of issues ofBobls and Bunds (November) and Schätze(December) by 32 billion each as envisaged in
the issuance calendar.
In November gross Federal Government bor-
rowing on the capital market amounted to323.1 billion and was made up primarily of
Bunds ( 38.9 billion), Bobls ( 38.6 billion) and
Treasury discount paper (Bubills - 34.4 billion).In the case of Bubills, the average yield of the
monthly issue was 2.94%, which was a fur-ther 11 basis points below the previousmonth’s level. After deducting redemptions,the outstanding amount of Bobls increasedby30.5 billion, whereas the outstanding vol-
ume of Bubills decreased by 30.5 billion. No
Bunds were redeemed. A rise of 30.5 billion
in the outstanding amount of Schätze offseta combined decline in Federal savings notesand Federal Treasury financing paper of30.2 billion. Bank loans against borrowers’
notes were reduced by 33.5 billion.Federal Government borrowing in the

10Securities markets
Bond marketOverall, hardly any new funds were raised in
the German bond market in October. Al-though domestic borrowers issued 382.7 bil-
lion worth of debt securities, only slightlyfewer than in the previous month ( 383.4 bil-
lion), redemptions during the same periodcame to 382.2 billion. When adjusted to take
account of changes in issuers’ holdings oftheir own bonds, domestic bonds outstand-ing consequently rose by only 32.9 billion. In
total, 31.6 billion (net) worth of foreign
bonds were sold. The amount raised fromsales of domestic and foreign bonds wastherefore 34.5 billion in October.
The public sector increased its indebtedness
in the bond market by 34.2 billion net in Oc-
tober (September: 37.0 billion). The Federal
Government alone accounted for 37.3 billion,
raising 35.7 billion net from the sale of two-
year Treasury notes (Schätze), followed by32.9 billion from sales of ten-year Federal
bonds (Bunds). The sale of five-year Federalnotes (Bobls) raised 30.1 billion. The amount
of Federal savings notes outstanding, how-ever, fell by 31.7 billion.
2TheLand govern-
ments issued 33.1 billion (net) worth of their
own bonds. An overall reduction of 36.2 bil-
lion was made in the liabilities of the Treu-hand agency and the former Federal Post Of-fice.
Enterprises sold 33.0 billion net worth of
bonds in October, compared with 32.6 billion
in the previous month. By contrast, the creditinstitutions redeemed bonds amounting to
34.3 billion overall, after having expanded
their bonded debt by 322.2 billion in Septem-
ber. On balance, the main repurchases wereof public Pfandbriefe (- 33.5 billion), followed
by other debt securities (- 32.4 billion) and
mortgage Pfandbriefe (- 30.7 billion). By con-
trast, debt securities issued by specialisedcredit institutions were sold for 32.3 billion
net.

11folios, almost entirely by purchasing domestic
paper issued by private borrowers ( 314.1 bil-
lion). Foreign investors reduced their holdingsof German bonds by 31.1 billion, this being
accounted for by shifts from private bonds(-38.2 billion) to public bonds (+ 37.1 billion).
On balance, credit institutions sold 39.7 bil-
lion of fixed-interest securities, most of whichwere bank bonds (- 38.7 billion). Their hold-
ings of foreign bonds and notes thus con-tracted by 31.2 billion.
Equity marketSales in the German equity market remained
subdued in October. Domestic enterprisesplaced new shares to a market value of 30.6
billion (September: 30.7 billion), almost all
these shares being in unlisted enterprises. Onbalance, foreign investors were the main pur-chasers of shares in German enterprises ( 30.8
billion); a somewhat smaller amount was in-vested by domestic credit institutions ( 30.3
billion), while, overall, non-banks sold thiskind of paper (- 30.5 billion). At the same
time, the banks upped their holdings of for-eign shares by 31.0 billion, the corresponding
increase at non-banks being 31.6 billion.
Mutual fund sharesDomestic mutual funds recorded considerably
larger net inflows in October ( 36.1 billion)
than in the previous month ( 32.7 billion). This
was accounted for primarily by institutionalinvestors increasing their investment in spe-cialised funds ( 35.4 billion), especially share-
based funds ( 32.8 billion). By contrast, mu-
tual funds open to the general public raisedonly 30.7 billion from the sale of additional
shares. Private investors continued to show apreference for open-end real estate fundsand money market funds, which are con-sidered to be less risky; they invested 30.9 bil-
lion net in the former and 30.6 billion net in
the latter. On balance, no resources were in-vested in share-based funds in October.Funds of funds and mixed funds had to repur-chase shares ( 30.1 billion and 30.2 billion re-
spectively). Bond-based funds also recordednet outflows ( 30.4 billion). Sales of foreign
fund shares raised 31.1 billion net. Mutual
fund shares were purchased mainly by resi-dents ( 37.4 billion), almost all of the pur-
chases being made by non-banks. Non-residents surrendered 30.1 billion worth of
shares in German investment companies.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account ran a surplus of
35.4 billion in October, which was 31.2 billion
less than in the previous month. The declinewas due to a larger deficit on invisible currenttransactions with non-residents, which is thatpart of the current account comprising ser-vices, factor income and current transfers. Bycontrast, the trade surplus was almost thesame as in September.
According to figures from the Federal Statis-
tics Office, the surplus on foreign tradeamounted to 311.1 billion in October com-
pared with 310.9 billion in September. After
the elimination of seasonal influences, how-ever, there was a month-on-month fall of 32
billion to 310 billion, which was due to a

12much sharper fall in exports of goods than in
imports. Seasonally adjusted terms exports inOctober were approximately 5
12% down on
the previous month while imports declined by2
12%. As exports in the two previous months
(August and September) had increased fairlystrongly, however, the aggregate of thethree-month period of August to Octobershowed a significant 6
12% rise over the previ-
ous period; imports of goods also rose dis-cernibly on a three-month comparison(5
12%).
The remaining current transactions with non-
residents ran a deficit of 34.9 billion in Octo-
ber, which was 31.2 billion more than in Sep-
tember. That was due both to a 30.8 billion
rise in the deficit on services, which amount-ed to 33.4 billion, and to a net increase of
30.7 billion in payments to non-residents in
the case of current transfers, which amount-ed to 33.2 billion net in October. At 31.7 bil-
lion, however, net factor income from abroadwas somewhat greater than in the previousmonth.
October saw a sharp shift in portfolio transac-
tions. This resulted in net capital outflows of35.9 billion through portfolio investment
compared with net capital imports of 39.9
billion in September. In October German resi-dents invested 35.5 billion net in securities is-
sued by non-resident borrowers; in each ofthe two previous months they had withdrawnfunds from foreign securities markets. In themonth under review they acquired foreignequities worth 32.8 billion as well as foreign
bonds and investment fund certificates worth31.1 billion in each case. Non-residents, whoMajor items of the balance

main constituents of their net sales were Ger-man bonds and notes ( 30.6 billion) and
money market paper ( 30.5 billion). By con-
trast, they invested 30.8 billion in the German
share market.
There were likewise net capital exports ( 32.7
billion) in the field of direct investment in Oc-tober. German enterprises provided their sub-sidiaries abroad with 34.0 billion in additional
investable funds. Foreign proprietors also im-proved the financial provision of theirbranches and subsidiaries domiciled in Ger-many ( 31.4 billion). In both cases most of the
transfers were in the form of intra-groupcredits.
The non-securitised credit transactions of
non-banks with non-residents led to a verymoderate inflow of funds in October. Enter-prises and individuals imported 30.4 billion
net and general government 30.6 billion. By
contrast, the cross-border operations of thebanking system led to exports of funds. Thiswas due primarily to the transactions of thecredit institutions (net capital exports of310.0 billion), which had stepped up their
short-term lending to foreign borrowers sub-stantially. Mainly as a result of balances aris-ing within the payments system TARGET,there were also exports of funds ( 35.8 billion)
through the non-securitised credit transac-tions of the Bundesbank.
Consequently, total net capital exports far ex-
ceeded the concurrent surplus on current ac-count. This resulted in a (positive) balancingitem in the German balance of payments of318.9 billion.
The foreign reserves of the Bundesbank fell –
at transaction values – by 30.6 billion in Octo-
ber.

15Recent tax
revenue trendsFollowing a period of strong growth
between 1998 and 2000, tax receiptsfell considerably from 2001 onwardsowing to large shortfalls in the wakeof the tax reform and the more un-favourable economic climate; this wasthe main reason for the steep rise inthe general government deficit in Ger-many. Whereas the direct tax burdenhas recently been eased noticeably, therelative weight of indirect taxes hastended to increase. This reflects themeasures aimed, on the one hand, atlightening the tax load on incomesand, on the other, at increasing the taxcharge on consumption – primarily ofenergy – with a view to providing add-itional government grants to the statu-tory pension insurance fund so as tocurb non-wage labour costs. With agrowing share of pensions now fi-nanced out of general taxation, thetaxes and social security ratio was oflate much lower than in 1997. In 2003,however, the levy burden will increaseagain significantly as a result of therise in social security contributions andthe announced tax measures.
Underlying trends
The tax revenue trend in the last four years
may be divided into two distinct phases. Inthe period between 1998 and 2000 tax re-ceipts recovered noticeably after being wellbelow expectations for several years prior to

161998.1The increase in revenue exceeded
nominal economic growth, which alsostrengthened; this was attributable to a highrevenue inflow from profit-related taxes – inpart due to a tightening of tax concessionsfor the promotion of investment in easternGermany – and the rise in indirect taxes.Since 2001, by contrast, tax receipts have de-clined noticeably. Besides the large tax short-falls in the wake of the tax reform, this mir-rors the worsened overall economic situation.The revenue trend has been additionally de-pressed, of late, by structural effects and de-clining back payments in respect of earlieryears, whereas previously it was buoyed byfavourable assessment outturns.
Total tax receipts – as defined in the govern-
ment’s financial statistics – grew in the lastfour years at an average rate of only 2
14%,
which was somewhat weaker than nominalGDP (+2
12% per annum). The overall tax
ratio – ie the ratio of tax receipts to nominalGDP – fell substantially in 2001 after record-ing a significant rise up to 2000 (see chart onthis page). In 2001 the tax ratio, as defined inthe government’s financial statistics, amount-ed to 21.5% – somewhat less than in 1997(21.8%) – and consequently recorded its low-est level since the late 1950s. However, ac-cording to the definition used in the nationalaccounts, the overall tax ratio marginally in-creased (by 0.2 percentage point to 23.6%)in the period under review.
2This shows grow-
ing discrepancies compared with the ratio asdefined in the financial statistics, which to anincreasing extent understates the tax burdenin Germany through the deduction of trans-fers – such as child benefit and the grant tohome buyers. In this sense, the tax ratio asdefined in the national accounts is also moremeaningful when comparing tax burdens atan international level. However, over time itsdevelopment is likewise distorted somewhatby certain substitution processes.

2This is based on the definition chosen by the European
System of Central Banks, which, contrary to ESA 95, fully
includes the tax shares paid to the EU in national tax rev-
enue because from an economic viewpoint these tax lev-
ies, like other tax receipts, are to be regarded as a burden
on the tax payers of the country concerned. This ap-
proach has the additional advantage that the tax ratio
trend is not distorted upwards over time by the shifts in
the method of financing the EU from VAT to GNP re-
sources.

like the tax ratio – fell below its level in 1997by 1 percentage point. In 2000, by contrast, ithad reached a high of 43.9%. The ratio of so-cial security contributions to GDP was reducedsignificantly by the greater co-financing ofpensions out of general taxation; it came to18.5% in 2001, compared with 19.7% in1997. Although the German tax ratio is rela-tively low by international standards, since inother countries (such as the UK and someScandinavian countries) social benefits are fi-nanced to a greater extent out of tax revenue(see table on this page), the overall taxes andsocial security ratio in Germany, despite itsmarked decline in 2001, was only marginallybelow the EU average and was still well abovethe figures for the United States and Japan.
Positive revenue trend between 1998
and 2000
After the tax reform concept of the previous
government coalition foundered in the Bun-desrat (upper house of parliament) in autumn1997, tax policy was limited, at first, to partialtaxation and tax relief measures which broad-ly balanced out. Thus trade capital tax wasabolished at the beginning of 1998, confiningthe levying of trade tax to income and earn-ings. The associated relief for enterprises was,however, offset by tightening the regulationsgoverning the determination of profit. In add-ition, the solidarity surcharge on income taxand corporation tax was also lowered at thebeginning of 1998 by 2 percentage points (to5.5%). Conversely, the standard rate of turn-over tax was raised on 1 April 1998 by 1 per-centage point (to 16%) to enable the Federal
Government to make an additional grant tothe statutory pension insurance fund, insteadof having to increase the contribution rate.
Tax receipts went up by 4
12% in 1998 in the
context of stronger economic growth. Al-though the rise in nominal GDP in 1998 byjust over 3% was still somewhat lower thanexpected (based on the comparable officialestimate from autumn 1997), tax receipts ex-ceeded this figure by 35 billion. The main rea-
son for this was the favourable developmentof profit-related taxes which resulted – partlywith a considerable time-lag – from the im-proved profitability of enterprises and wasalso supported by the reduction of tax con-cessions for the promotion of investment ineastern Germany.International comparison of the tax

18Following the change of government in au-
tumn 1998, new tax reform projects were ini-tiated. Besides new arrangements concerninglow-paid part-time work, these projects com-prised an “ecological tax reform” and a re-form of income taxation. Under the “eco-logical tax reform”, the existing tax on energyconsumption was increased further fromspring 1999 and supplemented by a newelectricity tax, which – like the tax on motorfuel – was raised in stages over the subse-quent years. One of the aims was to intro-duce an environment policy steering function,although the producing sector was broadlyexempted on the grounds of internationalcompetitiveness. The other aim was to boostemployment by using the revenue from theadditional taxation of energy consumption tolower the contribution rate to the statutorypension insurance scheme and simultaneous-ly reduce non-wage labour costs. The incometax reform envisaged raising child benefit,gradually reducing income tax rates up to2002 (to a bottom rate of under 20% and atop rate of 48.5%) and lowering the corpor-ation tax rate applying to retained profits to40% (as from 1999). However, since the rulesfor determining profits were severely tight-ened, the first stage of the reform had virtual-ly no impact on overall revenue and, in fact,resulted in considerable extra burdens on thecorporate sector.
Although nominal GDP growth slackened
somewhat in 1999, tax revenue went upeven more sharply (by 6
12%) than in 1998,
mainly as a result of the rises in consumptiontaxes and a stronger concentration of eco-nomic growth on domestic demand, whichyields greater tax revenue than external activ-
ities. In addition, profit-related taxes con-tinued to develop favourably, partly thanks todeclining shortfalls resulting from tax conces-sions for the promotion of investment in east-ern Germany. The upshot was that revenueexpectations were exceeded by an evengreater margin than in 1998, namely by 36
12
billion.
In 2000 the income tax rates were lowered
further and child benefit – following a rulingby the Federal Constitutional Court – was in-creased again. Revenue from energy taxationalso grew far less than in 1999 – despite fur-ther increases in the tax rates – as a result ofmarked consumer restraint in response to therise in oil prices. Furthermore, the weakergrowth of private consumption dampenedthe increase of turnover tax receipts. By con-trast, profit-related taxes, for the most part,still produced abundant receipts owing tocontinuing robust profitability, the broaden-ing of the tax assessment base and high backpayments in respect of earlier years. Total taxrevenue exceeded the previous year’s level byjust over 3% and was again noticeably higher(by almost 34 billion) than the expectations,
even though nominal economic growth waslower than expected.

20of the income tax rates, which was initially
envisaged for 2002, was brought forward byone year and supplemented by further de-clines in tax rates planned for 2003 and2005; this should significantly reduce margin-al tax rates, particularly at the bottom andtop end of the income scale (in the final stageto 15% and 42%, respectively, excluding thesolidarity surcharge). Enterprises were alsogiven considerable relief by a cut in the cor-poration tax rate to a uniform 25% at the be-ginning of 2001 and the introduction of a fa-cility which allows non-corporations to partlyoffset trade tax against their income tax liabil-ity. This largely abolished the previous add-itional tax burden relating to the profits ofnon-corporations resulting from this levy.
4In
addition, the corporation tax regime under-went a systemic change from the previousimputation system to a system of income tax
relief on dividends, which included, as from2002, tax exemption for corporations on cap-ital gains from the sale of domestic participat-ing interests. However, tax depreciation ruleswere concurrently made much more restrict-ive.
On balance, the reform to this extent im-
proved the macroeconomic framework inGermany, since it reduced the existing loca-tional disadvantages for enterprises and cre-ated additional performance incentives bylowering tax rates and introducing the partialtrade tax offsetting facility.
5Furthermore, the
tax exemption granted to corporations forcapital gains from the sale of participatinginterests encouraged restructuring in the cor-porate sector. However, the marked deterior-ation in the tax depreciation rules made do-mestic fixed capital formation less attractive,including vis-à-vis financial investments. Also,the sharp lowering of the corporation tax rateand the changeover to a system of incometax relief on dividends reinforced the tax biasin favour of profit retention over distribution– which already existed in the previous imput-ation system – for shareholders with highmarginal tax rates and tended to weaken theallocation function of capital markets. Bear-ing in mind that the distributed profits of cor-porations are taxed far more heavily, they ul-timately fare little better after the reformthan non-corporations charged with the toptax rate.

not come into force until a later date and thattheir tax relief from restructuring is lowerthan the corresponding relief granted to cor-porations.
The overall tax ratio went down by 1
12per-
centage points in 2001, mainly as a result oflarge revenue shortfalls (of just over 1% ofGDP) ensuing from the first stage of the taxreform. Furthermore, tax receipts, which de-clined by 4
12%, also fell well short of the ex-
pectations for the first time since 1997 (by al-most 313 billion). This was mainly attribut-
able to the worsened economic situation.Profit-related taxes were additionally affectedby the turnaround on the stock markets,which led to high write-downs. Furthermore,structural factors also had an impact on turn-over tax, while profit-related taxes were ad-versely affected by smaller retrospective pay-ments in respect of earlier years as well astemporary influences caused by the tax re-form (for details, see page 23).
Further decline in the importance
of direct taxes
Receipts from direct taxes
6have grown over
the last four years by little more than 1% onaverage, thus continuing the decline – whichbegan at the beginning of the 1990s – in theshare of this tax category in overall tax rev-enue. In 2001 direct taxes constituted 49%of total tax receipts, compared with 51
12%i n
1997 and around 56% in 1991. Besides apolicy-induced rebalancing of the relativeweights, this development was also attribut-able to the fact that receipts from direct taxes
were increasingly depressed by offsettingtransfers.
In relation to income, too, the overall direct
tax burden fell somewhat in the last fouryears. If the sum of gross wages and salaries,plus civil servants’ pensions, entrepreneurialincome and investment income are taken as arough indicator of aggregate income, directtaxes amounted to just over 16% of that sumlast year, compared with just under 17% in1997. Solely on account of the in part consid-erable time lags between the generation ofincome and the resulting tax payments, thisgeneral ratio is not, however, identical to theeffective tax burden from direct taxes, towhich income was subject on average. More-over, with regard to the marginal tax burden,income is subject in some cases to tax ratesthat are still relatively high.
Revenue from wage tax – which is by far the
most important direct tax – grew only by anaverage of 1% in the last four years. Thiswas, however, partly attributable to the factthat child benefit, which is booked againstwage tax receipts, was raised twice duringthis period. But even before deducting childbenefit, wage tax receipts still grew far moreslowly, at an annual average rate of 1
34%,
than gross wages and salaries and civil ser-vants’ pensions (+2
12% per annum), from
which wage tax is deducted at source. Themain reason for this was the increasing im-

22pact of tax relief measures, particularly in the
past two years. If tax legislation had not beenamended, wage tax receipts would havegone up by around 4
12% on average be-
tween 1998 and 2001, ie almost twice as fastas the underlying income base. This mirrorsthe high revenue elasticity of this tax, derivingfrom the progressive tax scale.
7In the individ-
ual years the revenue trend of wage tax wasalso distorted, at times, by the postponedpayment of Christmas bonuses for tax rea-sons. In 2001 this somewhat moderated thefall in revenue brought about by the tax re-form.
Assessed income tax picked up markedly
from 1998 onwards after revenue from thistax had fallen sharply in the years prior to1998, not least owing to extensive tax con-cessions for the promotion of investment in
eastern Germany. Receipts from this statistical“residual”, which primarily reflects the differ-ence between the final tax liability and thetax receipts that are deducted at source (inthe case of wage tax, corporation tax and in-vestment income tax), quadrupled by 2000(to just over 312 billion), compared with the
low they had reached in 1997. However, theyfell again considerably in 2001 as a result ofthe more unfavourable economic climate andthe tax reform. The level of revenue from thistax was increasingly dampened by the factthat the method of promoting home owner-ship was changed in 1996 from a tax-deductible facility – which, for the most part,had depressed wage tax – to a grant which isoffset against assessed income tax. On theother hand, revenue from assessed incometax was no longer reduced by growing re-funds to employees, which had been the casebetween 1992 and 1996. This was attribut-able to income tax rate cuts and declining taxallowances, not least in connection with thepromotion of investment in eastern Germany.Gross revenue from assessed income tax – be-fore deducting refunds, the grant to homebuyers and investment grants – nonethelessamounted to just over 338 billion last year,

7This elasticity has even tended to increase somewhat
with the latest adjustments to the tax regime because, on
the one hand, the basic tax-free allowance was progres-
sively raised, thereby lowering the average burden and,
on the other, the marginal tax rate in the lower income
bracket now increases more rapidly than before.Sharp pick-up

23Revenue from tax on interest income rose
steeply from 2000 after developing ratherweakly prior to that; it reached 39 billion in
2001 – just over 1
12times as high as in 1997.
Firstly, savers’ tax-free allowance was halvedat the beginning of 2000, which, owing tothe delay in collecting this tax, also had animpact at the beginning of 2001 vis-à-vis thesame period in the previous year. Secondly,the massive portfolio shifts in favour of main-ly short-term interest-bearing investments,such as money market paper, also played arole following the sharp decline of shareprices since spring 2000.
Revenue from corporation tax grew steeply
between 1998 and 2000 (to 323
12billion,
compared with 317 billion in 1997) as a result
of improved corporate profitability and tight-er regulations governing the determination ofprofit. In 2001, however, receipts collapsed tozero; in fact, refunds actually somewhat ex-ceeded tax payments. This result stemmedfrom various causes. Owing to the steep cutin the corporation tax rate and a more un-favourable profit situation, firms made farsmaller advance payments than before, andretrospective payments also fell markedly. Inaddition, several exceptional factors resultingfrom the tax reform also had a major impact.For example, it was the last chance for enter-prises to claim tax write-downs on their par-ticipating interests before the tax exemptionof capital gains from the sale of equity stakescame into force.
8Moreover, under the transi-
tional arrangements pending the changeoverto the new system, firms could reduce theirtax burden by distributing profits retained inearlier years that had incurred a higher cor-poration tax rate. Since the associated tax re-
fund claim (compared with the old distribu-tion rate of 30%) was partly restricted at theturn of 2001-02, there was a strong incentivefor firms to quickly claim this tax credit. All inall, profit distributions further depressed cor-poration tax receipts in 2001 by an estimated321 billion, following almost 314 billion in
2000 and a more or less normal level – basedon the previous split corporation tax scheduleDM bn  5 bn

24Reduction in tax bill ensuing from a distribution of earnings retained in past years
Under the imputation system which prevailed
prior to the tax reform, profits earned and re-tained by corporations were initially taxed atthe rate applicable to retained earnings. Upondistribution, such earnings were taxed at thelower corporation tax rate applying to distrib-uted earnings (corporation tax reduction). Fur-thermore, the tax already paid – along with theinvestment income tax levied in addition – wasoffset in full against the income tax liability of(domestic) shareholders, for which the tax al-ready paid constituted an advance tax payment.This meant that the distributed profit was ultim-ately always taxed at the personal rate of in-come tax applicable at the time of distribution.
The tax reform replaced that imputation system
(for shareholders) by a system of income tax re-lief on dividends in which the now uniform cor-poration tax rate applicable to both retainedand distributed earnings has a definitive charac-ter; as a quid pro quo, only half of the dividendis liable to the shareholder’s personal income taxrate. The “tax credit” vis-à-vis the distributiontax rate which accumulated at the enterpriselevel prior to the change in the tax regime canbe claimed by firms for the next 15 years upon adistribution of earnings retained in past years.
If government were to refuse to accept such a
reduction of tax liability in respect of tax pay-ments already made, this would be questionableon both tax-systematic and constitutionalgrounds, as enterprises and shareholders wouldbe “misappropriated” in the amount of theforegone tax credit and the distributed profitwould ultimately be overtaxed because, on topof the high rate of corporation tax levied on theretained earnings, the shareholder’s personal in-come tax rate would be additionally charged onhalf of the dividend. This would also be prob-lematical because in the past firms sometimesdeliberately refrained from neutralising profitdistributions through a simultaneous capital in-crease as they could rely on the fact that thetaxes already paid on retained earnings wouldyield a tax credit upon distribution owing to thelower applicable tax rate; their faith in this on-going possibility thus needed to be respected bygovernment.
Hence the transitional arrangement for the
change of tax regime regarding the distributionof profits retained in earlier years is quite appro-priate. Moreover, it leads to no (or only verysmall) revenue shortfalls if all tax categories areconsidered together. Thus although corporation
tax receipts are thereby reduced sharply, morerevenue will be received (at least from domesticshareholders) in the form of investment incometax and possibly – given correspondingly high in-come tax rates – slightly more revenue from as-sessed income tax. Even if some tax shortfallsshould result on balance, this would be due tothe fact that the rate of corporation tax paid inthe past on retained earnings was higher thanthe personal income tax rate of the shareholder(until 2001) or the marginal overall tax rate pay-able on the dividend (as from 2002). This wouldthen likewise be quite appropriate.
The aforementioned situation may be summar-
ised in the following table (which for the sake ofsimplicity omits trade tax and the solidarity sur-charge):
For a distribution of “EK 45” in 2001 the tax of-
fice sustains a loss in corporation tax revenue of15 units of currency (CU) on a gross profit of 100CU as a negative offsetting item to the 45 CU ofcorporation tax received in the past. But it gainsan extra 17.50 CU in investment income tax.Similarly, the claiming of the tax credit resultingfrom the “EK 40” in 2002 leaves the tax officewith a positive balance in the year of distribu-tion from investment income tax and the corpor-ation tax reduction. Whether and to what ex-tent this balance remains positive after takingaccount of the (residual) assessed income tax de-pends on the individual income tax rate of the(domestic) shareholders. However, this revenueeffect occurs only at the assessment stage andthus later.

25– of around 312 billion in 1999.9The transi-
tional arrangements were, however, justifiedboth on systemic and constitutional groundsand had only a very small influence on overalltax revenue (see box on page 24).
Conversely, the corporation tax shortfalls re-
lated to these high one-off profit distributionswere largely counterbalanced by considerableadditional revenue from investment income taxon dividends (see chart on page 23). Thanks tothese extraordinary dividends, a record outturnof nearly 321 billion was recorded in 2001 for
non-assessed taxes on earnings, after consider-able revenue growth (by one-fifth to 313
12bil-
lion) had already been recorded in 2000, whenthe tax reform was adopted. Revenue fromthis tax category almost tripled vis-à-vis thelevel in 1997. The combined revenue from cor-poration tax and non-assessed taxes on earn-ings declined in 2001 by 316
12billion to 32012
billion; around half of this drop was attribut-
able to the corporation tax rate cut.
Trade tax receipts rose strongly until 1999,
even though since the beginning of 1998 thistax has only been levied on trade earningsand no longer on trade capital. Besides backpayments in respect of earlier years, the tight-er regulations governing the determination ofprofit and the improved profitability of enter-prises also had an impact. This rising tendencywas, however, superseded by a stagnation in2000 and a steep decline in revenue (of justover 9%) one year later. The main reason forthis was declining tax receipts for earlier yearsas well as a marked fall in advance tax pay-ments in 2001 as a result of the deterioratedearnings situation. Besides the worsenedmacroeconomic setting, tax write-downs on
participating interests and restructuring meas-ures in the corporate sector – such as the in-creased formation of interdependent corpor-ate groups (Organschaften) to facilitate the
intercompany offsetting of losses – likewiseled to considerable revenue shortfalls, whichwere also associated with severe distortionsbetween individual local authorities. Of late,trade tax revenue, at 324
12billion, fell mar-
ginally below the level of 1997.
Of the other direct taxes, wealth tax recorded
only a small residual amount of revenue afterthis tax ceased to be levied as from 1997. Bycontrast, receipts from inheritance tax wentup considerably, mainly because of the tax in-creases adopted to compensate for the lostwealth tax.
10Receipts from taxes on land and
buildings, which are levied at the local level,increased relatively steadily, not least as a re-sult of higher collection multiplication factors.

special factors (“EK 56” and “EK 50” distribution ef-

the abolition of wealth tax, in response to a ruling of the

26age in the wake of various tax increases. Con-
sequently, their share in overall tax revenuerose. Turnover tax and taxes on energy con-sumption, in particular, were raised with theobjective of limiting the contribution rate tothe statutory pension insurance fund throughadditional Federal grants to that fund.
Receipts from turnover tax increased at an
annual average rate of 3% between 1998and 2001; this was
12percentage point more
than the growth of nominal GDP and domes-tic demand, which is more relevant for taxrevenue purposes. Without the rise in thestandard rate which came into force on1 April 1998, turnover tax receipts would not,however, have kept pace with nominal eco-nomic growth. Although the flow of revenueaccelerated until 1999, in part owing to thestronger growth of domestic demand, rev-enue developed considerably less favourablythan domestic demand in the last two yearsunder review – particularly in 2001, when itdeclined by 1
12% (see box on pages 28 and
29). This was partly due to the fact that tax-free components of private consumption(such as housing rents and financial services)grew disproportionately strongly. In addition,consumers have been spending an increasingproportion of their income on food (which issubject to a lower rate of VAT), not least be-cause of the rise in prices in the wake of BSEand foot-and-mouth disease. Other factorsthat had an impact in 2001 were the strainedliquidity situation of some enterprises and theincreased number of insolvencies. Yet thesefactors do not per se fully explain the recentdisappointing revenue trend. It appears ratherimplausible that the extent of turnover taxfraud surged under a legal framework which
remained broadly unchanged until 2001.
Among excise taxes, the receipts from the
taxes on energy consumption – ie mineral oiltax and the new electricity tax – have grownsteeply since 1999 as a result of the multi-stage “ecological tax reform”. Receipts fromenergy taxes reached 345 billion in 2001,
compared with just under 334 billion in 1997.
The revenue level of these taxes was, how-ever, depressed somewhat by the consumerrestraint in response to the tax increases andthe rise in the price of crude oil. This was ac-tually consistent with the policy goal of curb-ing energy consumption. Non-wage labourcosts, too, were simultaneously reduced a lit-tle. Even so, the “double dividend” whichwas hoped for from the “ecological tax re-form” is likely to have been very modest.Moreover, the use of these tax receipts to fi-nance the statutory pension insurance fundtended to conceal the fund’s need for adjust-ment.
Receipts from the other indirect taxes only in-
creased by an annual average of 1
12% in the
last four years. The decline in revenue fromsome excise taxes was offset by partly sharpgrowth in motor vehicle tax, real estate trans-fer tax and tobacco tax as a result of (or in an-ticipation of) tax increases.

27iously undershot. Tax receipts (excluding re-
ceipts from local government taxes, whichare not recorded monthly) between Januaryand October were 2
12% lower than the cor-
responding level in 2001. According to thelatest official estimate, a shortfall of 1
12% vis-
à-vis 2001 is anticipated for 2002 as a whole.Tax revenue will consequently be 327 billion
down on the estimate from autumn 2001, onwhich the budgets were largely based; thiscorresponds to 1
14% of GDP . One reason for
these huge shortfalls is that the cyclical slow-down, which has persisted for longer than ex-pected, is having a surprisingly strong impacton profit-related taxes and has also resultedin sizeable write-downs. Furthermore, turn-over tax receipts are still developing unfavour-ably, mainly due to the decline in retail tradeturnover. In addition, considerable wage taxshortfalls have ensued from the smallergrowth in gross wages and salaries. Althoughthe rises in excise taxes (energy taxes, to-bacco tax and insurance tax), which wereintroduced at the beginning of 2002, haveoutweighed the additional tax relief grantedin the form of child benefit, the overall taxratio, according to the recent official esti-mate, will show another marked drop of 0.8percentage point (as defined in the govern-ment’s financial statistics) to 20.8%.
Conversely, a bigger inflow of revenue is an-
ticipated in 2003 in the light of the expectedupturn in economic growth as well as the fur-ther tax increases and measures designed toclose special tax loopholes. According to thelatest tax estimate, a revenue increase of justover 4% is expected for 2003, given nominaleconomic growth of 3
12% and real growth of112%, which would push up the tax ratio to
21% (and to just over 2212% before deduct-
ing child benefit). These figures include thetax measures adopted to finance aid to theflood victims, ie postponing the next stage ofthe tax reform to 2004 and temporarily rais-ing the corporation tax rate to 26.5%. How-ever, they exclude the tax package adoptedby the Federal Government after the Germangeneral election – which envisages revenueimprovements of 35 billion for 2003
11grow-
ing considerably in subsequent years (to justover 318 billion or around
34% of GDP in
2006).
The planned tax measures comprise curtailing
existing turnover tax and energy tax privil-eges, axing subsidies, extending the taxationof private capital gains and introducing re-strictive measures in the enterprise sector,which will primarily reduce firms’ ability tooffset losses and further lessen the scope forclaiming tax depreciation allowances (see boxon page 31). The envisaged measures merit adifferentiated assessment. From a tax system-ic and macroeconomic perspective, the ef-forts to reduce or eliminate some privileges –such as the grant to home buyers and variousturnover tax reductions which are also con-tained in the Subsidy Report – are to be wel-comed.

28Deutsche BundesbankDevelopment of turnover tax receipts vis-à-vis the national VAT assessment base
The national VAT assessment base may be approximately de-
duced from the national accounts using the subtractive oradditive procedure. According to the subtractive method –which, with the aid of certain assumptions about the futureexpenditure structure of GDP, is also used for the official taxestimates – the most important tax-free components (net ex-ports, business investments resulting in a tax credit to VAT,including changes in inventories) are deducted from nominalGDP. Turnover tax receipts are then estimated based on theremaining “modified domestic expenditure”. A comparisonof the correlation between these two variables for the past
shows, however, that the growth of turnover tax receipts –adjusted for the increase of the standard rate in 1998 – hasremained lower than the growth of this rough approxima-tion for the national VAT assessment base almost continu-ously since the mid-1990s.
This may suggest an erosion of turnover tax receipts in rela-
tion to the national VAT assessment base that is tending to
1Statistical inaccuracies arise, firstly, from the rough disaggregation
of the figures in the national accounts. Secondly, for the sake ofsimplicity this calculation ignores the implicit taxes which burden tax-free components of private consumption where there is no tax credit

30proposals – can be justified systemically with-
in the framework of a comprehensive incometaxation approach, in accordance with theprinciple of taxing all accretions to wealth.However, there is a danger that this may ad-versely affect domestic capital formation and,if applied retroactively, public confidence inthe stability of the overall taxation regime.Furthermore, the package largely exemptsprivileges relating to employee compensa-tion.
The package of measures also encroaches on
areas which rightfully form part of the tax sys-tem as an integral whole. The envisaged cur-tailing of firms’ ability to offset losses againstprofits will tend to weaken entrepreneurialrisk propensity and dampen the investmentclimate. In a neutral tax system governmentshould participate equally – ie on a full andtimely basis – in both profits and losses. In-vestment risks for residential constructionand the overall economy will also ensue fromthe planned reduction of depreciation allow-ances for buildings, which would worsen theinvestment conditions for enterprises at aninternational level, too. In addition, theplanned restrictions on intercompany nettingwould make Germany less attractive as a lo-cation for group holding companies, after itslocational attractiveness had been enhancedby the tax reform 2000, which granted taxexemption to corporations’ capital gains fromthe sale of participating interests. Hence,some elements of the tax package are prob-lematic under longer-term growth and em-ployment aspects. Moreover, the changes willalso make German tax legislation more com-plicated.Further tax policy reforms are planned for the
coming years in the areas of municipal fi-nance and the taxation of retirement income.The reform of local authority finance primarilyconcerns trade earnings tax, which is prob-lematic both at the municipal level (becauseof its high elasticity to cyclical developments)and for tax systemic reasons (owing to thedisadvantage imposed on a specific type ofincome and the resulting distortions). It is es-sential to replace this tax with a source of in-come which – without entailing macroeco-nomic drawbacks – would again provide localauthorities with a steadier revenue trend.There are two conceivable approaches in thiscontext: firstly, broadening the trade tax as-sessment base by including elements that areindependent of earnings and extending it tofree-lance professions and, secondly, com-pletely abolishing this tax and compensatingthe local authorities through a municipalmultiplier or add-on facility on income taxand corporation tax as well as possibly givingthem a larger share of turnover tax. From atax systemic and macroeconomic perspective,the second approach is preferable.
12Abolish-
ing trade tax would make the taxation systemmuch less complicated and would bringabout a more even taxation of different typesof income. “Revitalising” trade tax by includ-ing elements which are independent of earn-ings would, by contrast, represent a return totaxing firms’ capital reserves and would thuspartly cancel some earlier reform steps.
12So as not to handicap cities vis-à-vis their rural catch-
ment area, income tax could in future be coupled partly
to the place of employment instead of the place of resi-
dence.Reform of

32Following a constitutional ruling, a new
method has to be found for taxing retirementincome, since the present practice of taxingonly the notional accrued interest componentof normal pensions represents an unfair ad-vantage with respect to the taxation of civilservants’ pensions. The ruling made in Marchcould be seized as an opportunity to changeover to taxing general pensions, too, at thebenefit rather than the contribution stage.Given the problems of double taxation and ofrevenue shortfalls which would stem from aprogressive tax exemption of contributions,the transition will have to be phased, how-ever, over a longer period. The reform shouldalso be used to harmonise the tax treatmentof different old-age provision instruments;various privileges should also be reviewed inthis context.Further reforms are required to make the tax
system less complicated, more neutral from amacroeconomic point of view and, ultimately,more geared to performance incentives. Akey need is to further lower the marginal taxrates on the factor labour, which are alsohigh by international standards. This wouldnecessitate additionally lowering the tax ratesfor medium incomes, too, while at the sametime reducing existing tax breaks for employ-ees. Significant tax cuts can, however, only bemade after the government budgets havebeen consolidated. Moreover, the marginalrates of tax and social security contributionson labour income can only be reduced last-ingly if the social security systems, too, arethoroughly reformed.
Annex
Major tax policy measures since 1998
Act to Continue the Business Tax Reform
(Gesetz zur Fortsetzung der Unternehmens-steuerreform) of October 1997
This Act abolished trade capital tax at the begin-
ning of 1998 and stipulated that, in eastern Ger-many, it was also not to be levied in 1997. The netannual shortfalls in tax revenue of around 32 bil-
lion which resulted from the abolition of this taxwere financed predominantly by stipulating that,-from 1997, tax provisions for anticipated lossesfrom uncompleted transactions were no longer tobe set up and that existing provisions were to bereversed within six years, thus boosting the dis-closed profit. The Act further put an end to abusive
practices with regard to carrying forward lossesand reduced the previous tax concession for extra-ordinary income. From 1998, local authorities weregiven a share of just over 2% of turnover tax rev-enue as a substitute for trade capital tax.
Act to Lower the Solidarity Surcharge (Gesetz
zur Senkung des Solidaritätszuschlags) of

Act concerning the Financing of an Additional
Federal Grant to the Statutory Pension Insur-ance Scheme (Gesetz zur Finanzierung eines
zusätzlichen Bundeszuschusses zur gesetz-lichen Rentenversicherung) of December 1997
To avoid raising the contribution rate to the statu-
tory pension insurance scheme, an additional Fed-eral grant to this social security fund was intro-duced in 1998 and financed by raising the stand-ard rate of turnover tax by 1 percentage point to16% (with an unaltered reduced rate of 7%) as of1 April 1998. The expected revenue increase fromthis source was just under 35 billion for 1998 and
rose to 38 billion in 1999.
Tax Relief Act 1999 (Steuerentlastungsgesetz
1999) of December 1998 and Tax Relief Act
1999/2000/2002 (Steuerentlastungsgesetz
1999/2000/2002) of March 1999
These Acts, which were passed following the Ger-
man parliamentary election of 1998, initiated a re-form of the income tax regime in three stages be-tween 1999 and 2002. In its first year, the reformgranted gross tax relief totalling around 327 bil-
lion, of which almost 317 billion was to be fi-
nanced by widening the tax assessment base. Thefirst two stages were designed to have virtually noeffect on revenue. The tax relief consisted, aboveall, of an increase in child benefit in 1999 of DM30per month to DM250 per month for the first andsecond child and a gradual lowering of income taxrates up to 2002 to a bottom rate of 19.9% and atop rate of 48.5%, coupled with an increase in thebasic tax-free allowance to around DM14,000 peryear. Furthermore, the top rate of income tax forbusiness earnings was reduced from 47% to 45%
in 1999 and to 43% in 2000, while the corpor-ation tax rate applicable to retained earnings waslowered by 5 percentage points to 40% at the be-ginning of 1999. The widening of the assessmentbase focused primarily on tightening the tax regu-lations governing the determination of profits byrestricting existing facilities to set up provisions, towrite down assets to their going-concern value(with the simultaneous introduction of a require-ment to reinstate original values) and to transferhidden reserves. The tax package also restrictedthe possibility of offsetting losses between varioustypes of income and of carrying back losses, abol-ished the tax rate reduction for extraordinary in-come, halved savers’ tax-free allowance (as of2000) and extended the applicable “speculationperiod” for taxing private capital gains to one yearfor securities and ten years for rented property.
Act Revising the Arrangements for Low-Paid
Part-Time Workers (Gesetz zur Neuregelung
der geringfügigen Beschäftigungsverhält-nisse) of March 1999
The tax exemption ceiling for low-paid part-time
workers was set at DM630 per month for bothwestern and eastern Germany as of 1 April 1999and not increased thereafter. In addition, a com-pulsory contribution was introduced for thesepart-time low-paid jobs consisting of a basicemployers’ contribution of 12% of the wage to bepaid to the statutory pension insurance schemeand 10% of the wage to be paid to the statutoryhealth insurance scheme. Earnings of employeesreceiving income solely from one part-time low-paid job were exempted from tax (whereas previ-ously wage tax had been imposed at a flat rate of20%).

34Act Initiating the Ecological Tax Reform
(Gesetz zum Einstieg in die ökologischeSteuerreform) of March 1999
The first stage of the “ecological tax reform” –
which sought, on the one hand, to curb statutorynon-wage labour costs and, on the other, to makeenergy consumption dearer – was introduced on1 April 1999. It increased the existing mineral oiltax by 6 pfennigs/l for petrol and diesel, by 4 pfen-nigs/l for heating oil and by 0.32 pfennigs/kWh fornatural gas, and introduced a new electricity tax of2 pfennigs/kWh. The tax increase was moderatedin the case of the producing sector, the farmingsector and the railways. The expected additionalrevenue of just over 34 billion in 1999 was ear-
marked to finance the simultaneous lowering ofthe contribution rate to the statutory pension in-surance scheme by 0.8 percentage point.
Act Continuing the Ecological Tax Reform
(Gesetz zur Fortführung der ökologischenSteuerreform) of December 1999
This Act encompassed further increases in mineral
oil tax on fuel of 6 pfennigs/l per year as well as arise in electricity tax of 0.5 pfennig/kWh per yearfor the years 2000 to 2003. The resulting addition-al revenue, which was forecast to grow from 32
12
billion in 2000 to almost 311 billion in 2003, was
earmarked to finance a further increase in the Fed-eral grant to the statutory pension insurancescheme.
Family Assistance Act (Gesetz zur
Familienförderung) of December 1999
The minimum subsistence level for children, below
which tax exemption applies, was substantiallyboosted in line with a ruling of the Federal Consti-tutional Court. In the first stage, which came into
effect at the beginning of 2000, the revised familyassistance arrangements included the introductionof a child-minding allowance of DM3,024 per child(under 16 years of age) and a further increase inchild benefit of DM20 per month to DM270 permonth for the first and second child. The resultingshortfalls in tax revenue amount to almost 33 bil-
lion per year.
1999 Tax Adjustment Act (Steuerbereinigungs-
gesetz 1999) of December 1999
This Act, which entailed annual shortfalls in tax
revenue of around 31
12billion, was designed inter
aliato adjust several counterfinancing measures
concerning the business sector laid down in theTax Relief Act 1999/2000/2002.
Act Amending the Housing Allowance Act
and other Acts (Gesetz zur ¾nderung des
Wohngeldgesetzes und anderer Gesetze) of
December 1999
This Act lowered the income ceiling for entitlement
to the home buyer’s grant at the beginning of2000 from DM240,000 to DM160,000 for singlepersons (double amount for married couples) inthe relevant two-year tax period. The new incomeceilings are raised by DM60,000 for each child.
Tax Reduction Act (Steuersenkungsgesetz) of
October 2000 and Supplementary Tax Reduc-tion Act (Steuersenkungsergänzungsgesetz)
of December 2000
These Acts, which entail additional tax relief total-
ling332 billion up to 2005, involve a further reduc-
tion in income tax rates and a reform of businesstaxation. The reduction in income tax rates

35planned for 2002 was brought forward by one
year; income tax rates are to be reduced further inthe years 2003 and 2005 (to a starting rate of15% and a top rate of 42%), with a simultaneousraising of the basic tax allowance to DM15,000.The reform of business taxation lowered the cor-poration tax rate to a uniform 25% at the begin-ning of 2001. Moreover, the existing imputationsystem for corporation tax was replaced by a sys-tem of income tax relief on dividends, and corpor-ations’ capital gains from selling domestic equitystakes were exempted from tax as of 2002. In-come tax for non-corporations was reduced from2001 by 1.8 times the trade tax assessment base.Furthermore, the halving of the tax rate upongiving up the business was reintroduced (as ofthe age of 55) and the tax-free amount on sellingthe business was raised from DM60,000 toDM100,000. The counterfinancing measures fo-cused on lowering the declining-balance depreci-ation rate for investment in machinery and equip-ment from 30% to 20% per year, cutting thestraight-line depreciation rate for commercialbuildings from 4% to 3% per year and adjustingthe official depreciation tables to “more realistic”write-off periods (the latter by administrative regu-lation).
Act Introducing a Standard Travel Allowance
(Gesetz zur Einführung einer Entfernungs-pauschale) of December 2000
At the beginning of 2001, in response to the steep
increase in crude oil prices on the world markets,the existing petrol allowance of 70 pfennigs perkilometre claimable by commuters was convertedinto a standard travel allowance independent ofthe means of transport used and increased to 80pfennigs per kilometre for that part of the distancebetween a commuter’s home and his/her place ofwork which exceeds 10 kilometres (resulting in an-
nual shortfalls in tax revenue of around 3
12billion).
Act Promoting Private Pension Plans
(Altersvermögensgesetz) of June 2001
This second part of the pension reform constituted
a first step towards funded pensions by promotingcertain forms of supplementary old-age provisionthrough grants and tax allowances from 2002. Upto 2008, the Act lays down the progressive intro-duction of a basic grant of 3154, plus a supple-
mentary grant of 3185 per child, for contributions
to private pension plans that meet certain criteria.Instead of the grant, a tax allowance can beclaimed which will increase in stages to a max-imum amount of 32,100 in 2008. The later pen-
sion payments resulting from these tax-free savingswill be taxed in full (taxation of benefits). The taxenvironment for company pension schemes waslikewise improved. The Act entailed shortfalls intax revenue which will increase progressively fromaround 3
12billion in 2002 to over 310 billion as of
2009.
Second Family Assistance Act (Zweites Gesetz
zur Familienförderung) of August 2001
This Act – which entails annual shortfalls in tax rev-
enue of around 3212billion from 2002 – is the
second step in fulfilling the Federal ConstitutionalCourt’s stipulations of 1998 concerning extendedtax exemption up to the minimum subsistencelevel for children. For this purpose, the child bene-fit granted for the first and second child was in-creased at the beginning of 2002 from DM270 to3154 per month for each child and the tax allow-
ance for children was raised to 33,648. Further-
more, a child-rearing component was added to theexisting child-minding allowance of DM3,024, as a

32,160 since 2002. Moreover, a deduction for
proven employment-induced child-minding costswas introduced for children under 14 years of ageup to a ceiling of 31,500 per child where such
costs exceed the existing child-minding allowance.On the other hand, the household allowance isbeing reduced gradually and the special allowancefor household employment was abolished.
Act to Curb Illegal Employment in the Con-
struction Industry (Gesetz zur Eindämmung
illegaler Betätigung im Baugewerbe) of
August 2001
In order to curb illegal employment in the con-
struction industry, awarders of construction con-tracts are required to deduct 15% of payments tocontractors above a certain threshold as a with-holding tax and to transfer this to the tax author-ities if the contractor in question does not have anexemption certificate (this is expected to yield add-itional revenue of around 3
14billion as of 2002).
Act on Financing Activities to Combat
Terrorism (Gesetz zur Finanzierung der
Terrorbekämpfung) of December 2001
In order to finance the additional expenditure on
internal and external security amounting to 3112
billion, this Act increased tobacco tax in two stages
(by 1 cent per cigarette at the beginning of both2002 and 2003) and insurance tax (by 1 percent-age point to 16% at the beginning of 2002).Act for the Further Development of Business
Tax Law (Gesetz zur Fortentwicklung des
Unternehmenssteuerrechts) of December
2001
This Act, which has little effect on revenue, is de-
signed primarily to facilitate the restructuring ofnon-corporations and, secondly, to end certain ac-counting options in respect of trade tax with aview to improving the financial position of local au-thorities.
Act to Combat Tax Evasion (Steuerverkür-
zungsbekämpfungsgesetz) of December 2001
This Act is designed to curb turnover tax fraud
through improved monitoring procedures (this isexpected to yield additional revenue of around32
12billion per year as of 2002).
Flood Victim Solidarity Act (Flutopfer-
solidaritätsgesetz) of September 2002
The costs of overcoming the flood damage caused
predominantly in eastern Germany are being fi-nanced by postponing the income tax reliefplanned for 2003 by one year and by temporarilyraising the corporation tax rate by 1.5 percentagepoints to 26.5% in 2003 (this is expected to yieldadditional revenue of around 36
12billion in 2003).

development ofearnings and costssince the early 1990sCorporate profitability is a key indica-
tor in free market economies. The pro-spect of larger profits is the primestimulus for the expansion and mod-ernisation of fixed assets and employ-ment opportunities. This article ana-lyses the development of macroeco-nomic earnings and costs in Germanyin the period since German reunifica-tion, taking as its basis the data in thenational accounts. The analysis revealsthat the general economic slowdownin Germany over time and comparedwith other countries has also had animpact on the aggregate profit indica-tors. The negative repercussions of thisprocess on the outlook for profits arelikely to have increased the longer itlasted. The high and rising number ofcorporate insolvencies, in particular, isa clear indication that resilience acrossthe whole corporate spectrum hastaken a knock. The data on returns de-rived from the national accounts musttherefore also consistently be viewedagainst a backdrop of the current riskprofile. One main factor to which at-tention should be paid is the extent towhich economic and fiscal policy meas-ures can be used to encourage thegeneration of income and the willing-ness and ability to incur and withstandcorporate risks within Germany.

38Difficult issues of delineation
Both at a national and an international level, a
number of criteria, measurement approachesand indicators have been developed and arein use for the purpose of measuring andevaluating the profitability of economic activ-ity. These vary in terms of the choice of resultand reference variables, the degree of aggre-gation, the underlying empirical data and thelength of the review period. Under free mar-ket conditions, an ultimately decisive factor ishow successful efforts are in effecting a per-sistent increase in corporate worth. Takingthis capital theory approach, profitability in aspecific period is the difference between thenet value at the start and at the end of thatperiod, taking account of the concurrent netdisbursements to capital investors. Irrespect-ive of whether the economic advantage de-rives from the internal use of productiveassets or from the transfer of usage rights tothird parties, it can therefore take the form of“distributed” market income or of growth inthe net value. This view applies not only to anindividual enterprise but also to economicsectors or to a whole economy.
It is admittedly more difficult to measure or
assess the earnings component “change inthe net value” for “Germany plc” than the(current) earnings over a given period. Forearnings in a given period, however, the na-tional accounts, including the financial ac-counts, provide important indications, at anaggregate level, of development trends andfactors relating to earnings and costs in theeconomy in general and in the corporate sec-tor in particular. This permits conclusions tobe drawn about the general investment and
financing terms determining economicgrowth and the pace of technical progress.Furthermore, the results in the national ac-counts (including the financial accounts) aresufficiently harmonised in the methodologyused in the ESA 95 to allow internationalcomparison. Corresponding data from thenational accounts are now available for Ger-many from the beginning of the 1970s.
The rules governing the collection, evaluation
and periodisation in the national accounts dif-fer in several ways from those of the systemof corporate accounting in accordance withGerman trade and tax law or the internation-ally recognised accounting standards (USGAAP , IAS) used to compile the consolidatedfinancial statements of listed enterprises.
1
One major difference is the treatment of im-puted items and the issue of corporate assetwrite-downs. Accordingly, the annual resultsprepared by the Bundesbank in accordancewith standard criteria and published in linewith the method used in its corporate bal-ance sheet statistics are comparable with na-tional account variables to a limited extentonly. Additional empirical and statistical prob-lems associated with a national profit andloss account are often reflected in the re-siduals and therefore in the profit statement,too. In particular, the high degree of aggrega-tion also needs to be borne in mind. Al-though the data can thus be presented in acompact, manageable form, they do not pro-
1However, owing to the different specific application or
weighting of the prudence or realisation principle, even
the different rules for the calculation of profit at the cor-
porate level result in significant material differences in

The total earnings from commercial activity inan economy in a given period depends, first,on the extent to which the available resourcesand (primary) factors of production can be in-cluded in the labour-related value added pro-cess in that period and, second, on the rela-tionship between transformation and trans-action costs and productivity profits and gainsfrom trade. The national accounts follow aproduction-based income approach which isalso geared to the current value of net assetsand establishes the methodological basis formeasuring profitability in a given period inthe overall economy and in the corporate sec-tor. In a macroeconomic circular flow model,the production sphere and the process of in-come generation are thus at the core of theex post analysis.
The corporate sector as defined in the ESA 95
does not include all production activities ofan economy but only those of corporationsand quasi-corporations. These include publiclimited companies, private limited companiesand partnerships with extensive decision-making autonomy, such as general partner-ships and limited partnerships and derivativelegal forms of business organisation. How-ever, both as investors and as consumers, soleproprietors, members of the professions andother self-employed persons are classifiedunder households. If one considers that some87% of all enterprises employ fewer than tenpersons and that there are around two millionsole proprietorships, defining the corporate
sector in this way creates major problems foran analysis of the German economy.
Some stylised facts on factor income
The 1990s had got off to a very promising
start for Germany. German reunification, forexample, was broadly expected to produce asecond “economic miracle”. Furthermore,Germany hoped to benefit from the integra-tion of central and eastern Europe into theinternational labour force, not least becauseof its geographical proximity to the countriesin that area. The swiftly advancing economicintegration within the EU, aimed at introdu-cing a single currency and a single monetarypolicy as well as at eliminating exchange raterisk for important export markets, should alsobe mentioned in this context. In particular,the rapid spread of new technologies in thelatter part of the 1990s fed expectations inGermany of persistently higher productivityand profit growth.
In retrospect, however, those hopes were
clearly short-lived – apart from the favourablemarket developments in central and easternEurope. In the 1990s income in Germany gen-erally grew far less than had been anticipatedat the start of the previous decade. This is im-mediately apparent from an analysis of grossdomestic product (GDP), which encompassesall the income generated within Germany and

40consumed by private and public households,
used for the purpose of maintaining or ex-panding tangible assets in Germany, trans-ferred abroad in the form of income andassets or invested outside Germany with aview to generating revenue. The annual aver-age increase of 1.5% in real GDP in the periodfrom 1991 to 2001 was well below the figuresfor the 1970s and 1980s, when annualgrowth rates of 2.8% and 2.3% respectivelywere recorded.
In order to determine market income, write-
downs first have to be deducted from GDPas, in the system of national accounts, theyrepresent an advance distribution benefitingthe real value of the stock of fixed assets. Inthe past decade investment shifts in favour ofshort-term capital goods and the relative age-ing of fixed assets in the wake of a decline inthe accumulation of capital meant that moreand more value added had to be used. Since1991 the real net domestic product has there-fore risen by only 1.2% per annum.
The real income generated in Germany,
which can be taken as a benchmark for realdisposable income, can also be affected bychanges in the real trading relationships withother countries. For example, a relative im-provement in export prices over import pricesgenerates additional purchasing power forconsumption or investment purposes in Ger-many as, at a given output, more goods canbe imported without worsening the externaltrade position. Although the average gains orlosses in purchasing power brought about bychanges in the terms of trade over the pastten years have largely cancelled each otherAt 1995 prices

41out, with the real net domestic income there-
fore also rising by 1.2% per annum, someyears nonetheless experienced a notableterms of trade effect. This was particularly soin 2000, when, despite the largest economicgrowth since German reunification, the 60%increase in the dollar price of crude oil andthe depreciation of the euro, in particular vis-à-vis the US dollar, resulted in a decidedlymodest increase of 1.0% in the real incomegenerated within Germany (including netproduction costs). All in all, although outputwas extremely high in 2000, relatively littlewas earned.
In order to obtain the factor income gener-
ated in Germany, account needs to be takenof the net taxes on production paid over tothe state.
3Owing to the increase in various
indirect taxes and the introduction of theecology tax, these taxes on production,which in 1991 amounted to roughly 11% ofthe marked-to-market domestic product, rosefar more sharply in the course of the 1990s –by 4
14% – than the domestic product. Over-
all, the nominal average 3% annual growthin factor income generated in Germanylagged somewhat behind the increase in thedomestic product.
In 1991 almost three-quarters of this factor
income was accounted for by employee com-pensation, which includes employers’ socialcontributions as well as gross wages and sal-aries. Calculated on an hourly basis, employ-ee compensation rose by just over 3
12% per
annum between 1991 and 2001. One con-tributory factor was that the state noticeablyincreased the contribution rates for social se-curity funds, thereby expanding the tax
wedge for the production factor “labour”.
4
The annual increase in hourly labour costsduring that period thus exceeded the rise infactor income generated in Germany by morethan
12percentage point. The effective wage
trend, which, calculated on an hourly basis,lagged well behind the increase in the agreedrates of pay (negative wage drift), thus actedas a certain corrective. The remaining pres-sure on costs led to an intensification of cor-porate rationalisation endeavours. Rising cap-ital intensity, for instance, was used to in-crease productivity. In order to maintain jobcompetitiveness, between 1991 and 2001(the period under review) capitalisation peremployee (excluding new housing) was in-creased by more than 2% per annum from3118,000 to 3145,000.
This left well over one-quarter of total earn-
ings as the operating surplus including the in-come of self-employed persons. In the periodfrom 1991 to 2001 it went up by an annualaverage of 3
14%. As, in the system of nation-
al accounts, the overall operating surplus stillincludes the total income of self-employedpersons, it is of only limited value as an indi-cator of the operating profit in the economyas a whole. At least the imputed entrepre-neurs’ income needs to be deducted as itbasically represents compensation for labourand, strictly speaking, may not be taken asprofit.

42The technical assumption normally employed
to this end is that the average compensationfor labour of self-employed persons (includingmembers of the family who work in the busi-ness) was just as high as employee compensa-tion. This assumption draws implicitly on theview that the proportion of a self-employedpersons’ earnings which is above the averagecompensation of a dependent employee rep-resents compensation for the effort and risksinvolved in being self-employed. Owing to thelack of relevant data, no account is taken ofthe possible differences in qualification levelsbetween self-employed persons and employ-ees. However, in order to take account of thedifferent length of time worked by self-employed persons and employees, with re-gard both to volume and to its development,it is better to base the calculation on the hour-ly rate of pay rather than the monthly com-
pensation. Self-employed persons worked anaverage of 2,200 hours in 1991, almost 50%more than the mean working hours of em-ployees. The average working hours of em-ployees declined more abruptly (by 7% over-all) between 1991 and 2001 than the workinghours of self-employed persons (-2
12%), re-
flecting the increase in part-time work amongemployees and the sharp rise in low-paidpart-time jobs. As an average of the totalperiod under review, the imputed entrepre-neurs’ compensation, as calculated here, ac-counted for 12
12% of the factor income gen-
erated in Germany. Adding this variable tolabour’s share in domestic income producesthe overall employee compensation rate (onan hourly basis), which accounts for roughlysix-sevenths of all factor income.
Macroeconomic profit ratio

a rough indicator, the share of profits (includ-ing the costs of equity capital) in the macro-economic income and thus the relative in-come position of capital, was 14

5The macroeconomic profit is derived by adding the bal-
ance of investment income received from and disbursed
to the rest of the world. In the case of households, how-
ever, only the interest paid and received in the context of
operations is to be included. Owing to the difficulty of
making an appropriate distinction between these oper-
ationally determined flows of interest and households’
other net interest inflows, no attempt is made to deter-
mine this variable. The balance of the total income invest-
ed abroad worsened distinctly in the period under review.
Although a surplus of 316 billion was recorded in 1991, a
deficit of 39 billion was recorded in 2001. This develop-
ment reflects the decline in Germany’s net investment in-

43the longer term, the profit ratio can be said
to be very stable. However, shocks can causedeviations from the “norm”, which it cantake years to correct. An expansionary wagepolicy, entailing initially small rises in un-employment, for instance, can have, overtime, an impact on the functional distributionof income in favour of labour. Over the longerrun, however, that kind of wage policy, byweakening development investment and in-creasing capital intensity, leads to a worsen-ing of the employment situation and the dis-tribution of income is finally adjusted back infavour of capital.
6That kind of pattern of
response was observable in Germany in the1970s, for example.
Profit is thus an endogenous variable – and
not solely in accounting terms. At the corpor-ate level there are a number of adjustmentparameters which are geared to restoring anappropriate return. Closures, the relocationand outsourcing of parts of the value addedchain, the exploitation of leverage effects andrationalisation investment all help to ensurethat the “norm” will be restored over thelonger run. However, the basic macroeco-nomic problem is no longer to be foundamong ex post returns but in the negative cir-cumstances accompanying the stabilisationof returns.
Especially in the first half of the last decade
the profit ratio followed a pattern that wasvery similar to that seen in the 1970s. Markedincreases in the negotiated rates of pay inwestern Germany together with the swiftharmonisation of agreed compensation ratesin eastern Germany with correspondingstandards in western Germany, largely dis-
counting the sectoral and regional differencesin productivity, put profits under strong pres-sure against the backdrop of a clear overalleconomy slowdown. The profit ratio thus de-clined by more than 3 percentage points from15
14% in 1991 to 12% in 1993.Million

44Rationalisation investment and the elimin-
ation of low-profitability companies served toadjust labour productivity to the higher wagecosts by means of staffing cuts, which con-tinued into 1997. As the economy picked upagain, the profit ratio improved; it reached16% in 1998, exceeding its level at the startof the 1990s by just over
12percentage point.
Enterprises also benefited from the fact that,all in all, the social partners pursued a moder-ate wage policy during that period, with theexception of 1995.
The profit ratio declined again in the follow-
ing years, however, and was just under 14%in 2001, nearly
12percentage point down on
its average level of the previous ten years. Atfirst glance, the considerable decline in theprofit ratio in 2000, in particular, may comeas a surprise, since the economy was expand-ing fairly strongly. That profits nonethelessdeclined not only in relation to factor incomebut also in absolute figures is due primarily tothe massive worsening in the terms of tradeat that time, as has already been mentioned.This led to an income transfer out of Ger-many and thus to a reduction in domesticearnings and purchasing power by a good1
12% of the net domestic product. Although
all residents had to cope with real incomelosses arising mainly from the dramatic rise inenergy prices, factor income relating to cap-ital bore a disproportionate burden.
Enterprises were also burdened by the fact
that an inventory expansion amounting tomore than 35 billion was recorded in 2000;
this increased the domestic product in the na-tional accounts in line with the productionconcept and also had a positive effect on the
profit shown in the income accounts. How-ever, de facto, this was merely warehoused
production, which generated no income onthe market. In terms of the development ofthe profit ratio in 2001, although it was help-ful that no follow-up wage claims weremade, the sluggish economy in 2001 putgreater pressure on performance.
Profitability in the corporate sector
In 2001 more than three-fifths of the factor
income generated within Germany camefrom non-financial corporations (includingquasi-corporations). After employee compen-sation had been deducted, this part of thecorporate sector was left with an operatingsurplus of 3237 billion. Compared with 1991,
the operating surplus (before tax) went up by4% per annum. In terms of profitability, per-formance in the corporate sector was thusabove average. A key reason for this is prob-ably that this sector is heavily involved in theexport trade. Since the early 1990s, exportsgrew far more than the domestic economy;this was reflected not least in an expansion ofthe real balance of net exports, which wentup by 343.7 billion overall between 1991 and
2001 and amounted to more than 3% of realGDP by the end of the period under review.The German economy thus improved its pos-ition on the world market since the mid-1990s, after a distinct decline in Germany’sreal global market share in the first half of thelast decade.

in eastern Germany.7
For the same reason, the turnover of the non-financial corporations in the period from1997 to 2001, measured as a share in the op-erating surplus at production value, was9
34% on average, around 1 percentage point
higher than halfway through the period from1991 to 1996. The sales structure of inter-nationally operating enterprises, which hassince become regionally very diversified, islikely to have been a stabilising element inthe development of profitability. The clearlypoorer economic performance by enterprisesin the household sector than that of the cor-porate sector as defined in the national ac-counts is likely to be linked not only to thefact that that sector’s activities focus mainlyon the more difficult area of domestic trade,but also to the fact that smaller enterprisestend to have fewer diversification and adjust-ment opportunities available to them.
However, corporations were only able to
draw on a small part of the net corporateprofits
8for internal financing purposes. On
average, between 1991 and 2001 the divi-dends paid by corporations and withdrawalsfrom the quasi-corporations absorbed morethan nine-tenths of the earnings. Between1999 and 2001 dividends and withdrawalseven exceeded total profits. The negative fig-ures for retained profits admittedly do not re-flect a sudden worsening of the profitabilityoutlook. Instead, fairly large amounts of re-tained income were released for tax reasonsand in order to permit dividends to be paidout.
9In 2001 only 3167 billion was thereforeavailable to enterprises for internal financing
purposes, including capital transfers andwrite-downs. With an overall borrowing re-quirement of 3325 billion, the internal finan-
cing rate was scarcely above 50%. This wasfar less than the average in previous years.Overall, between 1991 and 2001 internal fi-nancing resources went up by 19%, ie by1
34% each year. With regard to the use of
funds, enterprises ploughed more into finan-cial capital than into tangible assets. Halfway%

46through the period under review gross fixed
capital formation by the corporations in-creased by only 1
14% per annum at current
prices. In terms of constant prices it was only
12% per annum and thus even less than in
the overall economy.
When deciding whether or not to invest in an
enterprise, the expected internal rate of re-turn is of ultimate relevance, as is the possibil-ity – compared with the “guaranteed return”of an alternative form of investment – of ob-taining an appropriate remuneration for therisks associated with the corporate invest-ment. It is important to consider the returnson investment achieved to date in that an ex-tended period of insufficient returns is likelyto dampen profit expectations and thus thepropensity to invest. In addition, the incomesurplus or cash flow is an important source of
financing for enterprises with external finan-cing restrictions.
However, owing to the lack of statistical data,
no information can be given at present onthe development of the return on fixed assetsin the corporate sector. In particular, inter-national comparisons of returns also showthe lack of appropriate variables on the com-mercial capital stock to be a key restrainingfactor. An interim solution, however, may beto draw on results in the national financial ac-counts. If the ratio of the operating surplus tothe total capital is used, a distinctly negativeunderlying tendency is evident throughoutthe period under review. What is striking isthat the return on capital in 2001, the lastyear covered by the statistics, was, as a cor-porate average, still below the figure for1993, the economic downturn year. This canbe taken as evidence that the economy start-ed 2002 from an unsatisfactory profitabilitysituation.
The pressure on profitability has increased
further in the current year. Contrary to origin-al expectations, economic growth has beeneven weaker than in the previous year andthe output-capital ratio declined further forcyclical reasons. Although the yield in the fi-nancial markets reached a historical low andthe monetary framework conditions are con-ducive to fixed capital formation, it is mainlya general poor underlying sentiment in an en-vironment of marked uncertainty that is cur-rently impeding a rapid recovery of invest-ment.

number of company closures which is shownin the statistics is a clear sign of this.
Without doubt, a high risk premium is cur-
rently blocking the realisation of investmentprojects; in a phase of increased uncertainty,it is worth the individual investor waiting. This“wait-and-see” option appears to be worth alot at present and thus raises the usual profit-ability threshold.
10As a decision variable,
interest rates recede into the background.What is needed, therefore, are stable, calcul-
able framework conditions. Economic policy,and especially fiscal policy, and the socialpartners are presented with a particular chal-lenge. Greater financing flexibility for enter-prises on the basis of longer-term dependablecalculation principles are the market-relatedanswer if the corporate risk-return ratio is tobe put back on a more even keel.

49Developments
in the externaleconomic relationsof the EU accessioncountries in centraland eastern EuropeThe European Union’s negotiations
with the accession countries in centraland eastern Europe are now well ad-vanced. It is expected that eight of theten candidates will join the EU as earlyas 2004. These countries would then beable to join the Eurosystem two tothree years later at the earliest. How-ever, this depends on their achieving ahigh degree of sustainable conver-gence by that time. The provisions laiddown in Article 121 of the EC Treatystipulate that, in assessing the sustain-ability of convergence, due consider-ation is to be given not only to thequantified convergence criteria in thestricter sense of the term but also tothe “situation and development of thebalances of payments on current ac-count”. This raises the question as tothe sustainability and evaluation ofthese developments. In the light ofthis, the following article begins bydescribing the external position of theaccession countries concerned
1and
the underlying macroeconomic savingsand investment decisions. This is fol-lowed by an examination of the struc-ture of the financial account and ananalysis of developments in externaldebt as further indicators for assessingthe current account situation in thevarious countries.

50Preliminary remarks
Current account deficits tend to be the rule
rather than the exception for countries in theprocess of transformation and are not to bejudged a priori as a negative factor. Even so,
the risks which can emanate from current ac-count deficits in connection with currencyand financial crises have frequently been evi-dent in the past. For example, countries withcurrent account deficits that are deemed tobe unsustainable are more vulnerable toswings in financial market sentiment andtherefore more prone to speculative attacks.Current account deficits may also be symp-tomatic of other external and internal eco-nomic imbalances such as a real overvalu-ation of the domestic currency, an inadequatesaving ratio or an excessive state deficit. It isnot least for that reason that current accountdeficits often prove to be an important lead-ing indicator in currency crisis models. Finally,it should be noted that an abrupt reduction inan excessive current account deficit – trig-gered, for example, by a currency crisis – isgenerally associated with high real adjust-ment costs.
There are a number of theoretical and empir-
ical approaches for determining the sustain-ability of current account deficits. The factthat the results of these have to be interpret-ed with caution means that their informativevalue is limited, however.
2For example,
models based on the intertemporal balanceof payments theory generally show unrealis-tically large values for sustainable deficits.While the results do improve if credit restric-tions and portfolio adjustment processes aretaken into consideration, even minor changes
in portfolio preferences lead to substantialchanges in the sustainable deficit.
3Further-
more, these models, on the whole, are verysensitive to the choice of parameters, and es-timating the relevant coefficients is fraughtwith a high degree of uncertainty. Added tothis is the – in some cases – problematicaldata provision with respect to the countriesof central and eastern Europe, which makesit even more difficult to define these ap-proaches empirically.
Consequently, another way of assessing a
given country’s external economic positionhas to be found below.
4Given the major role
that foreign trade and, in particular, the rapidgrowth in import demand play in the acces-sion countries’ current account deficits, amore precise examination will first be madeof the development and structure of foreigntrade and an account will be given of therelative significance of the remaining currentaccount transactions. Light will then be shedon the decisions on saving and investmentwhich ultimately constitute the domestic eco-

Development and structureof the current accounts
Since the mid-1990s the aggregate current
account deficit of the accession countries incentral and eastern Europe has been runningat between 4% and 6% of gross domesticproduct (GDP) although some countries, on
an individual basis, have at times been record-ing a significantly larger deficit. In the major-ity of cases the deficit is due to the large netimports of goods, which, on an aggregatebasis, have amounted on average to justunder 7% of GDP . The reason for this is thegrowth in the accession countries’ import de-mand, which has been running at double-digit figures on average since the mid-1990s.
The high rate of growth in imports is typical
of countries in the process of transformation.This is a result of the real transfer of resourcesfrom the highly developed industrial coun-Aggregated balance of payments of the EU accession countries

52tries, notably those in western Europe, to the
transition countries in central and easternEurope. This transfer of resources promotesand accelerates the process of reconstructionin those countries. That much is obvious aslong as these countries import capital goodsto be used in building up a competitive cap-ital stock. However, such goods have ac-counted for only about one-fifth of the totalimport turnover on average. The share of im-ported consumer goods – which can also
underpin the transformation process if theyrelease a greater amount of domestic re-sources for creating and modernising therelevant production capacity – has been on asimilar scale. However, more than half of theaccession countries’ total imports are inter-mediate goods and primary commodities,which are further processed in the countriesconcerned and in many cases then re-exported. This is a very clear indication of thehigh degree of integration into the inter-national value-added process alreadyachieved by these young market economiesduring the past decade or so.
The energy and raw material imports of the
central and east European accession countriesrecently averaged 14% of their total imports.However, the ratios vary fairly widely fromone country to another as international trad-ing in raw materials plays a major role insome of them, notably Bulgaria and Lithu-ania. For example, the share of imported en-ergy commodities in 2000 amounted to 27%and 22% of total imports in Bulgaria andLithuania respectively, and energy commod-ities also play an important role on the exportside in those countries at 15% and 21% re-spectively.
Foreign trade relations have become a key
driving force in the development and growthof most of the central and east Europeaneconomies. Their export sectors are thereforeof vital importance. For example, the ratio ofexports to GDP in the majority of these coun-tries is considerably above 50%; this ratio isactually much higher in the smaller countries

53in this group, at 60% to 90%. With ratios of
approximately 30% and 34% respectively,only Poland and Romania exhibit a compara-tively low degree of openness in this sense.
The impressive export success achieved by
the majority of the accession countries there-fore puts into perspective the heavy demandfor foreign resources which is satisfied by therelatively high level of and rapid growth in im-ports. At all events, the exports of the centraland east European accession countries havealso been increasing strongly during the pastfew years, namely at an average of 11%.Consequently, they have increased their shareof world trade from 1.8% (mid-1990s) to2.4% recently.
The high degree of openness, however, also
increases their dependence on external fac-tors and their susceptibility to exogenous dis-turbances. This is particularly true if a high de-gree of openness is accompanied by a con-centration of exports on only a few exportmarkets where the level of demand is per-haps also very volatile. In particular, a concen-tration of export business on the formerComecon countries (excluding EU accessioncountries) could harbour risks in this connec-tion because most of these countries are notyet so far advanced in the transformationprocess and have still to overcome enormousimbalances. This is true of Russia, for ex-ample, whose economic growth is very muchdependent on oil price movements andwhose susceptibility to crises was evident inthe financial crisis of 1998. However, Russia’sshare of the exports from the accession coun-tries now amounts to no more than 2% onaverage. Only Lithuania, which sends 11% of
its exports to Russia, has a higher degree ofdependence in this respect.
The central and east European accession
countries’ trade relationships with each other,which may represent a certain risk potentialowing to possible contagion effects, are onlyof limited significance for each of the coun-tries in this region. With the exception of theSlovak Republic (30%) and Lithuania (23%)the corresponding shares of exports are sig-nificantly below the 20% mark.
By far the biggest customers of exporters in
the central and east European accessioncountries are the EU countries, which absorbbetween 48% (Lithuania) and 74% (Hun-gary) of the accession countries’ exports and

54whose relative importance as a market for ac-
cession country exports is growing continual-ly. This level of absorption by the EU membercountries actually exceeds the importance ofintra-EU trade for the EU states themselves.Of the EU countries Germany is the most im-portant trading partner for the majority ofthe accession countries. The outstanding roleplayed by EU trade is a major stabilising elem-ent given the large extent to which the econ-omies in central and eastern Europe are de-pendent on exports.
Even so, countries with a large export ratio
may also incur risks if the range of goods theyhave to offer is limited. For example, a veryopen economy with a one-sided export baseor one that is dependent mainly on exports ofraw materials is more vulnerable to shifts inthe terms of trade and demand shocks involv-
ing specific goods. This applies, for example,to two of the Baltic states, large percentagesof whose exports, as already mentioned, con-sist of raw materials (Latvia: 34%) and fuel(Lithuania: 21%). A large part of Lithuania’sfuel exports evidently consists in transferringRussian energy commodities. Apart from ex-ceptions of this kind, however, the break-down of the central and east European acces-sion countries’ exports of goods does not dis-play any clear indications of very obvious mar-ket risks arising from an insufficiently variedexport structure.
A major factor determining the structure of
goods in foreign trade – in addition to geo-graphical location and natural supplies of rawmaterials – may, of course, be seen in theRegional structure of the exports of the EU accession countries

55relative cost advantages stemming from the
fact that wages paid in central and easternEurope are lower than those in the EU coun-tries. For example, Romanian and Bulgarianexports consist of a large proportion of tex-tiles and clothes. The exports of the other ac-cession countries are marked by large per-centages of mechanical engineering productsand motor vehicles. These amount to be-tween 34% for Poland and 60% for Hungary.In the case of Hungary, the figure is actuallymuch higher than the EU average of 43%.These countries’ growing integration into theworld economy is also evident in the increas-ing significance of intra-industrial trade com-pared with inter-industrial trade.
6This means
that the accession countries have a broad andvaried export base, which is undoubtedly anadvantage for the countries concerned interms of the sustainability of their foreigntrade deficits.
An increasing strain is being imposed on the
foreign trade balances of the central and eastEuropean transition countries not only by thehigh level of net imports of goods but also bythe rising interest payments on their growingexternal debt. The total deficit on factor in-come for this group of countries was latterlyrunning at 1.4% of GDP . In some cases thenet payments (as a ratio of GDP) were of aneven greater magnitude. That is true, for ex-ample, of Estonia (5.2%), the Czech Republic(2.7%) and Hungary (2.9%).
By contrast, the central and east European ac-
cession countries have been running sur-pluses on their services accounts with non-residents in recent years. These surpluseshave amounted to an average of 2% of GDP
and have been due mainly to foreign traveland transport. The external balance sheets ofthe accession countries have also been re-lieved by the receipt of current (unilateral)transfers amounting to about 1.4% of GDPover the past few years. Capital transfers, al-though not classified as current accounttransactions, were a factor only during theinitial phase of the transformation processand then mainly in the form of debt forgive-ness.
Savings and investment
By definition, the current account balance
corresponds to the difference between do-mestic savings and investment. Thus, a sur-plus on current account means that nationalsavings in the country concerned are greaterthan the simultaneous amount of investment.“Surplus” output, ie that part of outputwhich is not consumed at home, is suppliedto customers abroad. Conversely, a currentaccount deficit is to be seen as a correspond-ing excess of domestic investment, which hasbeen “made good” through recourse to for-eign goods. A rise in the current account def-icit which can be attributed to an increase ininvestment is generally regarded as less prob-lematical than an increase in the deficit dueto a reduction in saving. This is particularlytrue in the case of the accession countries,which are disadvantaged by a small and out-dated capital stock. However, this appliesonly if investment is not being misdirected

57through government intervention, distorted
incentive schemes, false expectations andother market imperfections. The manner inwhich the reform process continues is there-fore of paramount importance.
In the light of this, developments in invest-
ment and saving in the central and east Euro-pean accession countries in the past may bejudged as rather unfavourable in severalcases. For example, there was a pronounceddecline in the saving ratio in Romania up to1998 and in Bulgaria and Lithuania in thesecond half of the 1990s. Although theiroverall savings level was higher, the savingratio also declined in the Slovak and Czech re-publics. The propensity to save also declinedin Poland last year.In the majority of the cases under review the
adverse development in national savings isclosely linked to the simultaneous deterior-ation in public finances. Half the accessioncountries in central and eastern Europe (theCzech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romaniaand the Slovak Republic) had governmentdebt ratios (government budget deficit/GDP)of more than 3% last year; the Czech andSlovak deficits actually amounted to morethan 5% of GDP .

58structuring of the banking and corporate sec-
tors, the modernisation of infrastructure andthe reform of the social security systems; onthe other hand, there have been substantialamounts of proceeds from privatisation evenif this income is available only for a limitedperiod and its availability does not always co-incide with corresponding outgoings. The cre-ation of a sufficiently broad tax base and theavoidance of expenditure commitments thatare unsustainable over the long term there-fore remain a key task for many of the acces-sion countries.
Development and structure
of the financial account
The type and composition of cross-border fi-
nancial transactions, which are ultimatelyused to finance the deficits on current ac-count, are of paramount importance for thesustainability of current account deficits. For-eign direct investment is generally regardedas the most favourable and, above all, mostreliable form of funding whereas capital in-flows through short-term portfolio and credittransactions are regarded as more volatile.This is particularly true if direct investment in-volves not only financial participation in en-terprises but is also associated with real in-vestment for the purposes of creating andmodernising the productive capital stock ofthe host country. It thereby contributes to po-tential growth and in many cases facilitatesthe transfer of technological and managerialexpertise.However, it is often very difficult to distin-
guish between such direct investment andportfolio investment. First, it is not alwayspossible to make a distinction between the– sometimes only temporary – acquisition ofparticipating interests and a long-term finan-cial investment; for the purpose of analysis itis therefore prudent to combine direct invest-ment and equity investment. Second,changes in the cross-border financial oper-ations between affiliated enterprises are fre-quently of a fairly short-term nature and cor-respondingly volatile.
Despite these qualifications with respect to
the informative value of data, the high ratioof direct investment (including equity invest-ment) to the total capital inflows into thecentral and east European accession countriesis striking. On an average of the past eightyears, cross-border corporate participatinginterests and lending to affiliated enterpriseshave accounted for more than two-thirds ofthese countries’ net capital imports. Of theaccession countries, the Czech Republic hasrecorded the largest inflows of direct invest-ment (in relation to GDP) followed, albeit atsome distance, by Hungary and Poland. Dir-ect investment also plays a relatively import-ant role in the Baltic states whereas the Slo-vak Republic did not begin to record signifi-cant capital inflows of this kind until 1999.With the exception of Slovenia, which has at-tracted little foreign capital so far owing todelays in privatisation, those transition coun-tries which have made most progress in theprocess of reform appear to have attractedmost of the direct investment. Extensive pri-vatisation measures and the liberalisation of

59cross-border financial transactions have been
particularly instrumental in promoting this de-velopment. However, the geographic proxim-ity to the single European market has alsomade economic and financial integration eas-ier.
Owing to the large share of direct investment
in the total capital imports of the central andeast European accession countries, their ex-ternal debt has increased relatively little des-pite the large current account deficits. For ex-ample, these countries’ total external liabil-ities, ie including the foreign financial claimsarising from direct investment and share-holding, increased from an average of 54%of GDP in 1997 to 72% in 2000. However,external debt in the stricter sense of the term– ie the sum of securitised and non-securitised credit liabilities excluding the liabil-ities arising from the ownership of participat-ing interests and equities – increased muchless rapidly and, at an average of 41%, wasno more than just over half as large at theend of 2000. The fact that it is mainly thecountries with relatively extensive inflows ofdirect investment capital that have compara-tively low levels of external debt is consistentwith this picture. For example, the relevantfigure for the Czech Republic was no morethan 33% whereas countries such as Bulgariaand Latvia, which likewise enjoy comparative-ly large inflows of capital but whose direct in-vestment ratio is much lower, have debtratios that are approximately twice as high.On the other hand, there are also central andeast European accession countries whichhave a level of external debt (in relation toGDP) that tends to be below average be-cause, overall, they have received much
smaller capital inflows than other countries.In relation to their exports of goods and ser-vices the external debt level of this group ofcountries, at 93%, was not very high eitherwhen compared with the corresponding fig-ures for other transition and developingcountries.
Short-term liabilities, which may lead very
quickly to undesirable capital outflows intimes of crisis and therefore deserve particularattention with respect to sustainability, ac-count for only about 22% of the averagelevel of external debt of the group of coun-tries under review; the ratio was actuallybelow 15% for most of these countries. Onlythe Baltic states and the Czech Republic havehigher ratios with Latvia and the Czech Re-public, at 38% and 42% respectively, havingthe highest ratios of all, and these are tendingto rise even further.
The features of the accession countries’ exter-
nal debt mentioned above are also reflectedin a relatively favourable cost of debt ser-vicing. According to the World Bank defin-ition, countries whose present level of debtservice is between 132% and 220% of thevalue of their exports of goods and servicesand between 48% and 80% of gross nation-al income are moderately indebted. Countrieswith larger debt coefficients are deemed tobe severely indebted. On the basis of this clas-sification, none of the central and east Euro-pean countries is to be regarded as severelyindebted. Bulgaria, Estonia and Hungary,however, are classified as moderately indebt-ed by the World Bank.

60In some cases the external debt of the transi-
tion countries in central and eastern Europe ispartly offset by not insignificant externalassets. In net terms, therefore, the total exter-nal debt of this group of countries was onlyjust under half as large as in gross terms(32% compared with 72% of GDP).
In some cases, however, the value of the cor-
responding external assets should not be ex-aggerated, especially if these assets stemfrom the Comecon era. Even so, about halfof the assets held are in the form of foreignreserves. All of these countries built up for-eign reserves during the 1990s, in some caseson a considerable scale.Summary and conclusions
In view of the sizeable ratio of direct invest-
ment to total capital imports and the, on thewhole, not excessively high level of net exter-nal debt, the large current account deficits ofthe accession countries may be regarded asless problematical than they may initially ap-pear. However, as privatisation is already welladvanced in some countries and a smalleramount of direct investment may be expect-ed from this source in future than in the past,ensuring a favourable environment for invest-ment will be even more important than be-fore. To this end the planned reforms shouldbe pursued with determination and the com-petitiveness of these young market econ-omies should be safeguarded by a stability-oriented monetary policy and sound govern-International investment position of the EU accession countries

*Monetary and fiscal policy rules in a
model with capital accumulation andpotentially non-superneutral money
Discussion paper 22/02
by Leopold von Thadden
Building on the work of John Taylor, the ad-
vantages of an “active” interest rate rulehave featured in many empirical and theoret-ical studies over the past decade in connec-tion with the debate on appropriate strat-egies for central banks. Taylor-type interestrate rules react to inflationary pressures bytemporarily raising the real interest rate. Froma theoretical perspective, the particular char-acteristic of such rules in many model situ-ations is that equilibrium dynamics are deter-minate. More recently, however, several stud-ies have indicated that simple interest raterules which (have to) respect the zero boundon nominal interest rates may indeed lead tomultiple steady states and globally indeter-minate adjustment processes.

In the light of this ongoing debate, the aim ofthis discussion paper is to indicate a furtherpotential source of multiple steady states andglobally indeterminate adjustment processes,under a simple interest rate rule within amodel framework that models the process ofcapital accumulation endogenously and also

70includes flexible prices and the dynamics of
government debt as elements of a long-runapproach. A further particular feature of themodelling is the paper’s assumption of anoverlapping generations economy in whichthe real long-run interest rate is not constantbut depends instead on the arrangement ofmonetary and fiscal policy and the long-runinflation rate. In general, it becomes apparentthat, given an interdependency of the long-run real interest rate and the long-term infla-tion rate, even a linear interest rate rule cangenerate globally indeterminate dynamics,whereas a simple policy of monetary target-ing – assuming a correctly predicted changein the velocity of circulation – is accompaniedby a unique steady state and determinate ad-justment dynamics.
This finding is illustrated for two different
monetary and fiscal policy arrangements inwhich fiscal policy is fundamentally subordin-ated to monetary policy. In the former case, itis assumed that fiscal policy aims for a con-stant debt level ratio. In the latter case, a con-stant deficit ratio is assumed.
When interpreting the model results, it
should be noted that the model disregards anumber of short-run frictions (especially nom-inal rigidities) which are typically taken intoaccount in the literature inspired by Taylor.For that reason, it is proposed that futurework expanding the findings of this papershould also, when discussing properties ofmonetary policy rules, go into short-run prop-erties of the modelling in greater depth thanhitherto.Time variation in the tail behaviour of
Bund futures returns
Discussion paper 25/02
by Thomas Werner and Christian Upper
For the purpose of estimating market risks, it
is important to know how probable extremeprice fluctuations in the financial markets are.Essentially, account needs to be taken ofprice movements in both directions as a sharpincrease in prices affecting holders of shortpositions can imply large losses just as muchas sharply falling prices among investors withlong positions. If the probability of extremevalues occurring is greater than implied bythe normal distribution, the term “fat tails” isused. Recent developments in extreme valuetheory enable this phenomenon to be ana-lysed without explicit assumptions having tobe made about the distribution of returns. Atail index can be used to measure the fatnessof the tails.
The literature on extremes of the distribution
of returns has so far dealt primarily with ex-change rates and share prices. By contrast,hardly any consideration has yet been givento the prices of bonds and notes or futurescontracts on bonds. This is surprising asbanks, in particular, often hold fairly largeopen positions in interest rate futures duringa trading day. This discussion paper endeav-ours to fill this gap. To this end, high fre-quency data for the Bund future – especiallyfive-minute returns – are analysed. Threequestions are at the forefront of the analysis:(i) Does the distribution of Bund futures re-turns have “fat tails”?; (ii) Is the probability of

time?; (iii) Can a tail index provide informa-tion about the degree of market uncertaintywhich cannot be gained using classical indica-tors such as volatility?
We were able to show that the “fat tails”
phenomenon does occur in the distributionof Bund futures returns. A tail index of ap-proximately 3 implies that the fourth and allhigher moments of the distribution do notexist. This shows kurtosis-based analyses tobe problematic and justifies the use of the ex-treme value theory. Recently developed testshave revealed breaks in the fatness of thetails in the distribution of returns. The tailindex does not always move in the samedirection as volatility. The two indicators maywell even send different signals at times. For
instance, a decline in volatility might be offsetby an increase in the fatness of the tail. Forthis reason, risk estimates based solely onvolatility are to be viewed with extreme cau-tion. Observing the tails of the distribution ofreturns thus provides information relevant torisk management which cannot be derivedusing conventional methods.
The results of this research project may be
viewed as the first step towards modellingthe fatness of tails. Future research projectscould identify factors affecting the fatness ofthe tails in order to gain a better understand-ing of its development over time and, whereappropriate, to enable measures to be takento influence it.
