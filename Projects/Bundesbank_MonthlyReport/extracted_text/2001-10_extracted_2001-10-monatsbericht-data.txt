In seasonally adjustedterms, incomingorders, which had decreasedstrongly in July, werealmost at the same levelasattheendofthesecondquarter.However,if the two summer months are taken to-gether, orders continued to fall by around1% from the previous quarter. Comparedwith the previous year, orders were down byjust under 4

has thus become perceptibly greater in thecourseoftheyear.

7lower than in the previous month, the under-
lyingtrendinemploymentisdownward.
In September, unemployment rose again
slightly in seasonally adjusted terms, afterstallingas a result of the special timingof thesummer holidays, particularly in eastern Ger-many. At the end of September the seasonal-ly adjusted number of jobless persons regis-tered at the Federal Labour Office was 3.88million – some 20,000 more than in the pre-cedingmonth and almost 60,000 more thanone year previously. In the second quarter of2001, the figure for the previous year wasdistinctly undershot. As calculated by the La-bour Office, with adjustment for the usualseasonal variations, the unemployment raterose to 9.4%. Accordingto the standardisedcalculation method based on the ILO con-cept,itwas7.9%.
PricesThe price environment eased further. The
year-on-year increase in the consumer priceindex fell from its peak in May (+3.5%) to2.1% in September. A base effect in the fieldof refined petroleum products made a sub-stantial contribution to moderatingprice in-creases in the period under review. In thecomparable period in 2000, the prices ofthese products had increased far morestrongly. Excluding energy, the gap comparedwith the previous year narrowed slightly from2.3% to 2.2%. Price movements in manu-factured goods and house rents remainedcomparatively moderate. By contrast, theprice decreases in services and food whichare usual at this time of the year were morestrictly contained than usual. The seasonal
food supply, in particular, suffered from in-clementweatherconditions.
International oil prices have been falling
stronglyinrecentweeks.Onaverage,abarrelof Brent oil still cost over US$ 26 in Septem-ber; when this Monthly Report went topress,it cost around US$ 22 only. This is likely to bereflected clearly in import prices. In August(the last date for which official data are avail-able) energy prices had already eased thepressure on import prices. Overall, importswere a good 1% cheaper in seasonally ad-justed terms; at 0.9%, they were down onthe comparable position in the previous yearfor the first time for a longwhile. Domesticindustrial sellingprices in Germany also de-creased slightly in August. The year-on-yeargapnarrowedfrom3.1%to2.7%.
Publicfinance
Government indebtednessIn August, the central, regional and local au-
thorities stepped up their indebtedness onlyslightly by 31.3 billion. The Federal Govern-
ment’s net borrowingdropped by as much as31.0billion.Although,bytheendofAugust,
the volume of outstandingmoney marketloans had increased by 32.7 billion, the in-
flow of capital from the capital market wasdown by 33.7 billion against the volume of
repayments. Notably, the Federal Govern-ment recorded a mere 31.1 billion through
the reopeningof five-year special Federalbonds (Bobls)while refinancingrequirements

market management operations, the FederalGovernment recorded a 34.5 billion decline
in borrowingfrom these securities. The re-mainingFederal securities (market manag e-ment and ongoing sales) generated 30.8 bil-
liononbalance.
The indebtedness of the LIMJJ8nder governments
continued to increase significantly. However,the 31.9 billion increase was smaller than
that of July. In August, credit financing re-quirements were almost exclusively coveredby Treasury note issues which yielded 32.6
billion net – two-thirds of this amount cameinto the longer-term maturity categories.Only a small amount ( 30.1 billion) of short-
term cash advances from banks was bor-rowed. Loans against borrowers’ notes were,on balance, repaid ( 30.8 billion). The special
funds stepped up their debt marginally by30.2 billion. The German Unity Fund had a
34.0billionstakeinthereopeningof Boblsin
order to finance the repayment of a loanwhich matured in August. The local author-ities appear to have made only small de-mandsonthecreditmarketinAugust.
Federal GovernmentborrowingIn September, the Federal Government again
marginally decreased its indebtedness by30.2 billion. Government gross borrowing of
317.7 billion from the capital market served
almost exclusively to satisfy the refinancingrequirements of 317.4 billion which arose
from the relatively high repayments sched-uled for this month. In the money market,the volume of outstandingloans decreasedby30.5billion.Governmentgrossborrowing
inthecapitalmarketconsistedmainlyoftwo-year Treasury notes and Federal bonds(Bunds).Theformeramountedto 38.7billion
which was mainly accounted for by a newtender ( 37.4 billion). The amount outstand-
ingincreased, on balance, by 33.9 billion. In
the case of Bunds, the second increase in the
May issue raised gross receipts of 36.3 bil-
lion, 30.6billionofwhichwasattributableto
borrowingfor the ERP Special Fund. By con-trast, the 8.25% bond of 1991 ( 39.2 billion)
was redeemed which, together with the saleof stocks set aside for market managementoperations ( 31.1 billion), led to a decline of
32.3 billion in the outstandingvolume of

9net. For loans againstborrowers’ notes, 31.0
billionnetwasrepaid.
From January to September 2001, total in-
debtedness of the Federal Government de-creasedby 317.6billion.Netborrowing–ex-
cludingadditional redemptions of equalisa-tion claims out of UMTS proceeds – amount-ed to 315.4 billion or just over two-thirds of
the 322.3 billion budgeted for 2001 as a
whole. In the same period, gross borrowing,by contrast, accounted for more than three-quarters of the amount envisaged in the Fed-eral budget. This reflects the relatively smallredemption requirement in the fourth quar-ter. As far as the structure of capital marketindebtedness was concerned, Bunds– whose
amount outstandingrose by 313.6 billion –
constitutedalmost60%oftotalFederalGov-ernment indebtedness. In the case of five to
seven-year maturity categories, the amountoutstandingof Boblsdecreased by 32.8 bil-
lion and that of Federal savings bonds by asmuch as 37.2 billion (or 20% of the total
amount outstanding). By contrast, shorterterm maturities in the form of Federal Treas-ury notes and Treasury discount paper(Bubills)expanded by 38.8 billion and 36.3
billion, respectively. The volume of new directlendingby banks continued to be lower thanthatofredemptions.The 36.2billionincrease
in money market indebtedness should beseen in the light of the virtually complete re-ductionin the useofthis form offinancingattheendof2000.

In August, the public sector sold its own
paper in the bond market to the extent of30.1 billion. The Federal Government issued
bonds to the value of 30.5 billion net and
launched a five-year special Federal bondissue by tender, at 4.5%, with a total volumeof37 billion. On balance, five-year special

1Ten-year Federal bonds and
two-year Federal Treasury notes were sold inthe amount of 31.1 billion and 30.6 billion
net, respectively. The outstandingvolume of30-year Federal bonds and Federal savingsbonds remained unchanged, however. Bondsissued by the “German Unity” Fund were re-deemed to the extent of 33.6 billion. In Au-gust, the LIMJJ8nder Governments sold bonds to-
talling 32.8 billion net;thatwas justasmuch
asinthepreviousmonth.
In August, credit institutions reduced their
bondeddebtby 33.6billionnet.Bothsmaller
gross issuance and higher redemptions con-tributedtothisresult,comparedwiththepre-vious month. The outstandingamounts ofcommunal bonds (/C214ffentliche Pfandbriefe)
and bonds issued by specialised credit institu-tions fell by 32.3 billion and 30.7 billion, re-
spectively. Other bank bonds and mortgagebonds (Hypothekenpfandbriefe) were repur-
chasedtotheextentof 30.3billionand 30.2
billion net, respectively. In August, sales ofcorporate bonds, at 32.0 billion net, were
markedly below the record level of the previ-ousmonth( 35.2billion).
In the market for Deutsche Mark/euro bonds
issued by non-residents under the lead-management of German syndicates, the issu-ingvolume (at 30.1 billion) was again lower
in August than amonth before( 30.5 billion).
After deduction of redemptions, the out-standingamount declined by 32.0 billion
(July:– 31.9billion).
On the buyers’side of the bond market, for-

funds came to 33.9 billion in August, com-
pared with 36.0 billion in the previous
month. The funds open to the general publicsold certificates totalling 32.3 billion. As in
July, the money market funds received themajor part of this sum ( 31.5 billion). Bond-

Balance of payments
Germany’s current account – the combined
outcome of foreign trade, services, factor in-come and current transfers – ran a surplus of33.3 billion in August following a deficit of
almost the same proportions in July. This wasdue mainly to a surplus on factor income,which had been in deficit a month earlier,and to a reduction in net expenditure on cur-renttransfers.
Accordingto calculations by the Federal Stat-
istical Office, the surplus on trade in goodsamounted to 38.2 billion in August and was
therefore 30.5 billion lower than in July.Share sales

12After the elimination of seasonal factors,
however, the trade surplus exceeded the pre-vious month’s level by approximately 32.5
billion. The reason for this was a sharp rise of4% in the export of goods in August com-pared with July and a simultaneous price-related decline of just under 1% in the valueof imports. German exports have now risenfor the third consecutive month; the overallincrease amounts to just under 3% com-pared with the previous three-month period(March to May). Duringthe same period im-portswentupby1%.
At34.5billion,thedeficitoninvisiblecurrent
transactions with non-residents was signifi-cantly smaller in August than it had been inJulywhenthedeficithadamountedto 311.3
billion. This was largely due to the trend infactor income, which recorded net income of31.6 billion in August whereas in July ex-
penditure had exceeded income by 33.5 bil-
lion. Furthermore, fewer current transferswere made to non-residents on balance withthe result that the deficit in this segment,which had amounted to 32.9 billion in July,
declined to 31.3 billion in August. By con-
trast, the deficit on services was largelyunchanged from the previous month at34.8billion.
Allinall,cross-bordercapitalflowswerefairly

demand from non-resident investors for Ger-man securities rose somewhat duringthemonthunderreview(from 38.2billioninJuly
to311.9 billion in August). The main reason
for this was that foreign investors were againactive in acquiringGerman bonds and notes(38.5 billion compared with minus 30.1 bil-

holdings of German money market paper by32.2billion.

16Thestateoftheaccessionprocess
The EU enlargement process, which began in
Luxembourg in December 1997, was given amajor boost by the meetings of the EU Headsof State and Government in Nice in Decem-ber 2000 and in Gothenburg in June 2001.The European Council (EC), convening in Nicefrom December 7 to 9, 2000, approved anew strategy, suggested by the Commission,for expediting the accession negotiations.The “timetable” drawn up thereafter, cover-ing a period of 18 months, mapped out theframe of reference within which the Uniondefines in concrete terms its attitude to theproblems encountered, including the applica-tions for transitional periods. At the sametime, the “timetable” forms a flexible frame-work for the accession preparations of thecandidate countries – a framework that canbe adjusted to the progress made by the indi-vidual states.
Another major outcome of the EC meeting in
Nice was the launch of an economic policydialogue with the candidate countries on thetopic of macroeconomic and financial stabil-ity. The EC approved a corresponding state-ment by the ECOFIN Council. That dialogue,and the efforts to achieve macroeconomicand financial stability, are designed to fostersustainable economic convergence. This newinstrument is intended to prepare the candi-date countries for their future economic andmonetary policy cooperation in the EU, aftertheir accession. At the same time, majorfoundation stones are laid for their subse-quent participation in European MonetaryUnion (EMU).
1In particular, the Intergovernmental Confer-ence (IGC) beginning in February 2000 servedto prepare the Community for enlargement;it was wound up by the Heads of State andGovernment of the EU following the Nicemeeting of the EC. The primary aim of thosedeliberations was to amend the Communitytreaties, so as to ensure the EU’s ability totake action in a Union enlarged to up to 27countries and, at the same time, to safeguardthe due representation of all current and fu-ture member states in the Community institu-tions. However, the agreed institutional re-forms, viewed as a whole, fell short of ex-pectations. That applies especially to thedecision-making procedure in the Council,and to the size and composition of the Com-mission. With regard to ensuring the Eurosys-tem’s ability to take action and its efficiency,an enabling clause was added to the Treaty ofNice incorporating a simplified amendmentof the voting procedure in the ECB GoverningCouncil.
2According to the presidency conclu-
sions of the Nice EC meeting, the Treaty ofNice paved the way for enlargement. In viewof the unsatisfactory results of the Nice con-ference, institutional reforms will continue toplay a key role in the already-agreed “post-Nice process”.
On the basis of the progress made to date by
the candidate countries and the continuationof the ratification procedure for the Treaty ofNice, the EC agreed in Gothenburg on

17June 15–16, 2001 on a time frame for the
completion of enlargement. The EC thinks itfeasible to complete the negotiations forthose countries which are adequately pre-pared for accession by the end of 2002, pro-vided that the progress made by the candi-date countries towards meeting the accessioncriteria is maintained. The intention is thatthose countries should be able to participate,as members, in the elections for the EuropeanParliament held in 2004. But the crucial factorgoverning the further course of events andthe completion of the accession negotiationsis the actual headway made by the variouscandidate countries.
Accession to the EU is conditional upon com-
pliance with the political and economic cri-teria laid down by the EC in Copenhagen in1993, as well as upon the adoption and im-
plementation of Community law (the so-called“acquis communautaire” ). At the
present moment, all the countries with whichnegotiations are being conducted
3satisfy the
political criteria, but only Malta and Cyprusmeet the economic criteria.
The negotiations on the adoption of the
acquis communautaire, which have been
subdivided into 31 chapters, have made goodprogress of late; in the process, the secondTheCopenhagencriteria
The Copenhagen criteria demand, as a pre-
requisite for membership:
– the stability of institutions guaranteeing
democracy, the rule of law, human rights,respect for and protection of minorities(political criteria);
– the existence of a functioning market
economy as well as the capacity to withstand competitive pressure and market
forces within the Union (economic cri-teria);
– the ability to take on the obligations of
membership, including adherence to theaims of political, economic and monetaryunion (criterion of adopting the acquis
communautaire).

18group of candidates has largely caught up
with the first one. Among the countries thathave made the most headway, more thantwo-thirds of the chapters have already beententatively closed.
Despite the progress made to date, however,
it must be borne in mind that the negotiationof the most difficult chapters – especially EUfinancing, agricultural policy and structuralpolicy – is still pending. In those areas, theCommunity, too, still has to define its pos-ition. Moreover, numerous calls for transition-al periods, which the Community intends toaccept only in justified exceptional cases, arehampering the negotiations. Another sourceof great controversy is the transitional ar-rangement sought by the EU with regard tothe free movement of persons.The monetary integration of the candidate
countries will take place in stages. The pre-accession phase will be followed by the post-accession period, which will be completed bythe introduction of the euro. As early as thepre-accession phase, ever-closer cooperationwill occur between the EU and the candidatecountries in the fields of economic, fiscal andmonetary policy. On the basis of the Euro-pean Treaties, the Community supports thepolicies of the candidate countries to fostermacroeconomic stability, as well as real andnominal convergence. By means of partner-ships with individual candidate countries, aprocedure to monitor budget policies hasbeen introduced.

19of the newly introduced dialogue on macro-
economic and financial stability, in whichhigh-level representatives of the governmentsand central banks of member states and can-didate countries participate; the first dialoguemeeting took place in Stockholm on June 27,2001. At a second such meeting towards theend of this year, the macroeconomic stabilityof the candidate countries and the stability oftheir financial sectors, including their progresstowards structural reforms, are to be assessedon the basis of a report by the Commission.In future, both meetings are to be held at an-nual intervals. Once a year, the dialogue willtake place at ministerial level. The Commis-sion will notify the Council about the conclu-sions reached at the high-level meetings and,every year, about the appraisals of budgetstatements and of the pre-accession econom-icprogrammes. By virtue of this newly intro-duced macroeconomic and financial dia-logue, the ECOFIN Council will play a moreand more important role in the final phase ofthe accession process.
Sustainableconvergencerequirements
After joining the EU – which presupposes
compliance with the accession conditions andthe completion of the accession negotiations,including ratification, in all the countries con-cerned – the candidate countries will partici-pate in Stage Three of EMU as “memberstates with a derogation” (Article 122, sub-section 1, EC Treaty); that is to say, they willnot immediately be member states of EMU.During that period, the candidate countrieswill have to make greater efforts to achieve ahigh degree of sustainable economic conver-
gence.
As a yardstick, the Treaty of Maastricht lists
the four so-called “convergence criteria”,and defines them in an accompanying proto-col. In its report to the EC in Nice on the ex-change-rate aspects of enlargement, theECOFIN Council confirmed that the same cri-teria as for the present euro-area countriesare to be applied to the candidate countries’full participation in EMU by the introductionof the euro. Specifically, the requirements arethat
– the inflation rate is to be not more than
one and a half percentage points abovethe average inflation rate of the threebest-performing member states of theEurosystem;
– long-term interest rates are to be not
more than two percentage points abovethe corresponding level in those threecountries;
– the public sector deficit is to be equivalent
to not more than 3%, and the level ofpublicdebt to not more than 60%, of thegross domesticproduc t;
– the country must have participated for
not less than two years in the EuropeanExchange-Rate Mechanism (ERM II) withinthe normal margins of fluctuation, with-out any devaluation being required.
Besides these quantified convergence criteria

20sions of Article 121, EC Treaty, “... the results
of the integration of markets, the situationand development of the balance of paymentson current account, and ... the developmentof unit labour costs and other price indices”are to be taken into account in the assess-ment of the sustainability of the convergenceachieved. Moreover, the candidate countrieshave to bring their statutory provisions intoline with the EMU regulations of the Treaty.Such legislative convergence, which is calledfor by Article 109, EC Treaty, is to be achievedbefore accession to the EU, with the amend-ment of the central banking laws and statutes– especially with respect to the independenceof the central bank – playing an importantrole.
All the convergence criteria specified are de-
signed to forestall inflationary tendencieswithin the monetary union and to avoid thetensions which may arise if the unified andcommon monetary policy fails to meet theneeds of all member states.
To that end, a strengthening of real conver-
gence is required, especially by means ofstructural adjustments and reforms. Progressin that area may be measured to a certain ex-tent by the movement of per capita GDP rela-tive to the EU average.
To date, developments in the candidate coun-
tries have shown a mixed picture. As regardsnominal convergence, a number of countrieshave made substantial headway in recentyears. However, there have also been somecontrary trends and setbacks of late. In par-ticular, inflation is proving to be more intract-able than was expected. That is due, firstly, to
rises in oil prices; furthermore, the price pres-sure has been reinforced by the low externalvalue of the euro, since most of the candidatecountries gear their exchange-rate policies tothe euro. Secondly, in a number of countries,domesticc ost pressures have been pushed upon the wage side. For instance, certain coun-tries, including Poland, recorded double-digitinflation rates again in the year 2000. Butsince the above-mentioned external factorshave dwindled in significance of late, theprice pressures have been tending to slackensomewhat most recently. On the other hand,the increase in the prices of non-tradables(such as services), which is typical of an eco-nomic catching-up process, persists, implyingthat inflation rates above the Communitylevel are likely in the medium term.
In the field of reducing public sector budget
deficits, more progress was generally made inthe year 2000. In Slovenia and the Czech Re-public, by contrast, a significant deteriorationin budgetary positions was registered. In Pol-and, the current year has witnessed a danger-ous imbalance in public finances. In view ofthe global slowdown in economic growth,though, rising budget deficits are to beexpected in other countries as well. Butthe level-of-debt criterion is currently beingmet by all the candidate countries exceptBulgaria.
As far as real convergence is concerned, a
lengthy catching-up process by the candidatecountries is to be expected. Measured interms of purchasing-power standards, percapita GDP, taking the average of all candi-

21date countries, stands at just over one-third
of the Community level. Only Cyprus and Slo-venia have reached a degree of prosperitymatching, or slightly exceeding, that of theeconomically weaker Community memberstates; the great majority of the candidatecountries are still distinctly below that level.What is needed in the long run in those re-gions is a significantly higher rate of realgrowth, relative to the Community, in orderto narrow the gap sufficiently to ensure thatno undue tensions arise among the partici-pating countries.
The persistent inflation in the candidate
countries owes something not only to exter-nal constraints, such as the rise in oil pricesand the strength of the US dollar, but also tounwelcome macroeconomic developments.Such developments result from the interplay
of the competing demands of consumers, in-vestors and the government on potential out-put, which, despite expanding strongly, is stillrather limited in level. As suggested above,increased cost pressure owing to excessivewage rises has likewise been felt in a numberof countries. Wage-indexation clauses andthe extrapolation into the future of the highrates of inflation observed in the past havealso contributed to such developments.
More recently, besides these familiar causes
of inflation, attention has likewise been fo-cused on more structural factors which en-gender a certain degree of inflation in thecandidate countries. A commonly mentionedfactor of this type is what is known as the“Balassa-Samuelson effect”, which arises be-Theeconomicdataofthecandidatecountriesfortheyear2000

23cause, in the economic catching-up process,
productivity in the manufacturing sector ofthe candidate countries goes up dispropor-tionately fast, and gradually approaches thelevel prevailing in industrialised countries. Butthe resultant upturn in earnings is often notreflected in corresponding cuts in the pricesof the industrial products concerned. This isbecause the candidate countries, without ex-ception, are small open economies whoseprices are oriented to the world-market pricesof the respective industrial goods. That af-fords leeway for wage increases in the indus-try in question, which give rise to matchingwage demands in other sectors of the econ-omy, whose productivity has not improved somuch. Since productivity gains in the servicessector, for instance, are typically lower than inthe field of industrial production, wage risesthere result in higher prices. On balance,therefore, the general price level in thosecountries goes up faster than in the more de-veloped economies, and the upshot is a realappreciation. According to Bundesbank esti-mations, taking the average of the past fewyears, this effect seems to have run at a mag-nitude of two to two and a half percentagepoints a year. Other computations come tosimilar conclusions (see the box on page 25).This is equivalent to roughly one-half of theaverage real appreciation against the EU re-corded by the candidate countries in recentyears.
In addition, a number of other factors are re-
sponsible for real appreciation in the transi-tion countries. First among these are shifts inthe structure of (product) demand, in favourof the tertiary sector. At the beginning of thetransition process, that sector often account-
ed for only a small share of aggregate de-mand. It gained greater significance only inthe wake of economic liberalisation. One ofthe reasons for that is the agricultural and in-dustrial bias of production structures, whichgoes back in part to the days of centralisedeconomic planning in those countries. More-over, on past experience, the demand for ser-vices rises disproportionately fast as incomesgrow. Both phenomena result in price rela-tionships shifting; specifically, services be-come more expensive relative to industrialgoods, which, given the often manifestdownward price rigidities, reinforces infla-tionary pressures, and is ultimately reflectedin a real appreciation.
Capital inflows from abroad likewise tend to
cause the domestic currency to appreciate inreal terms. That goes particularly for foreigndirect investment, which is of considerableimportance in many transition economies.Insofar as it is mainly the relatively capital-intensive industrialised sectors that benefitfrom the enhanced supply of capital, as isoften supposed, the improved capital flowfosters the productivity gain, and thus re-inforces the above-mentioned Balassa-Samuelson effect.
Thetaskofstabilisation
The task of stabilisation makes heavy de-
mands on candidate countries’ monetary pol-icy. Ultimately, what is needed is to devise aconvincing strategy, with the aim of loweringinflation rates in a reasonably predictable

24fashion to the level of those in the euro area,
thereby simultaneously reducing adjustmentfrictions, in the form of employment andgrowth losses, to an unavoidable minimum.This presupposes that the authorities are suc-cessful in shifting the inflation expectations ofall those concerned in the desired direction,while not only avoiding disappointments andunwelcome evasive reactions in the processbut also providing a sustainable basis forstrong and tension-free growth by ensuringsufficient predictability and dependability onthe monetary side.
Those aims are sometimes contrasted with a
scenario focusing on the short-term trade-offbetween the wish for a swiftly-movingcatching-up process and the objective ofmonetary stabilisation. In this context, mon-etary discipline is often seen as an unneces-sary “constraint on growth”. Corresponding-ly, a monetary policy strictly oriented towardsthe objective of stability is viewed as hostileto growth and employment. However, this isto disregard the fact that, judging by past ex-perience, attempts at monetary stimulationat best generate short-lived successes; overthe somewhat longer term, the expansionarystimulus fizzles out in a further accelerationof inflation, with the implication that the taskof stabilisation will subsequently be evenharder to perform – often, in fact, only at theprice of profound and sustained stabilisationcrises, with heavy losses of growth and pros-perity in real terms. At any rate, empiricaleconomic research has found distinct evi-dence that insufficient stability gives rise toreal growth losses in the longer run. Price sta-bility is an essential precondition for sustain-able growth. As a matter of fact, empirical
studies by the IMF substantiate the findingthat precisely those transition economies thathave pressed ahead most energetically withmonetary stabilisation
4have made the great-
est progress.
A problem which has attracted greater atten-
tion more recently is that of the implicationsof the above-mentioned structural price shiftsand their potential impact on inflation for theefforts at convergence. In principle, effects oninflation can be neutralised by a correspond-ingly restrictive stance on the part of monet-ary policy. On the external flank, the competi-tive advantages deriving, other things beingequal, from stronger productivity gains in theindustrial sector would be offset over thelonger term by a (nominal) revaluation (or re-duced devaluation) of the national currency.In other words, sufficiently flexible exchangerates would facilitate the catching-up pro-cess, in conformity with stability. They safe-guard the requisite monetary room for man-oeuvre. The unavoidable real appreciationwould then come about through an adjust-ment of the nominal exchange rate – ratherthan through inflation differentials vis-7MyyH-visthe more developed countries.
But a particular problem would be posed by
the emergence of structural inflation differen-tials if their impact on macroeconomic infla-tion rates were suppressed only temporarilyby a restrictive monetary policy, in order for-

25ThescaleoftheBalassa-SamuelsoneffectincentralandeasternEurope
In the debate on the accession of future EU
member states to the Eurosystem, the likelyscale of future inflation differentials is a cru-cial factor. Among the possible causes ofstructural inflation in developing countriesand emerging economies, most attention ispaid to the Balassa-Samuelson effect. How-ever, empirical studies measuring the contri-bution of productivity increases to real appre-ciation in the candidate countries of centraland eastern Europe are of only limited valuefor predictive purposes. Since membership ofthe EU may have a major impact on the fu-ture movement of the real exchange rate,historical contexts yield, at best, no morethan initial indications of the likely magni-tude. The table below provides an overviewof current studies of the Balassa-Samuelson
effect in the candidate countries.
The results vary according to the observation
period and the choice of country group, buta magnitude of one to three percentagepoints appears to be plausible. In the periodfrom 1997 to 1999, the currencies of the tencentral and eastern European candidatecountries, on an (unweighted) average, ap-preciated in real terms by just under 4 % ayear. Excluding Bulgaria and Romania, thatrate came to approx. 3.3 %. Hence theBalassa-Samuelson effect is responsible forroughly one-half of the average real appreci-ation rate in central and eastern Europe.

26mally to satisfy the inflation criterion set by
the EC Treaty. In the extreme case, it wouldeven be conceivable for economic reformsthat might temporarily entail price rises, butwould exercise a stabilising effect in the longrun, to be deferred, so as not to imperil ac-cession to monetary union. In this connec-tion, the decontrol of administered prices or alowering of income tax financed by raising in-direct taxes might be contemplated. At anyrate, after its hypothetical accession to theEurosystem, the country concerned would nolonger have a free hand to keep the second-round effects of such moves towards liberal-isation, or other structural tendencies to-wards price increases, under monetary con-trol. A progressive loss of competitivenesswould be the inevitable consequence.
Essential prerequisites of tension-free price
stabilisation are, however, a moderate andsophisticated wage-rate policy and sufficient-ly flexible prices. Failing this, combating infla-tion will succeed only via the “costly” routeof temporary employment losses. In particu-lar, decentralised wage bargaining, whichfrom the outset takes account of differencesin productivity between the various industriesand sectors, counteracts any price rises in theservices sector. Moreover, it may help to re-duce the social cost of adjustment arisingfrom the fact that productivity gains withinthe industrial sector by no means occur uni-formly, but may be enforced only by theshedding of labour or by factory closures.Stabilisationstrategiesandexchange-
ratepolicy
In the quest for a convincing stabilisation
strategy which gives the necessary guidanceto market players’ expectations and curbs theleeway for price rises on the monetary sidewithout impairing longer-term growth poten-tial, there are, however, no “patent remed-ies”. Monetary policy strategies with which acentral bank has enjoyed success need not bereadily transferable to conditions in anothercountry. For instance, the monetary targetingstrategies practised by the Bundesbank forover 25 years presuppose stable structural re-lations between changes in the money stockand price movements, and such relations can-not be taken for granted in most transitioncountries. Moreover, the strategy of “infla-tion targeting” employed today by a numberof central banks calls for a minimum of struc-tural stability between monetary policy instru-ments and price movements that does not al-ways obtain. For that reason, the majority ofcandidate countries made use, especially inthe early stages of the adjustment process, ofsome anchoring of their national currenciesto one or more stable key currencies. The de-gree of linkage ranges from a strict CurrencyBoard via pre-announced exchange-rate tar-get zones and “crawling pegs” to rather in-formal and highly flexible arrangements. Theanchor currencies used are likewise by nomeans uniform, even though, on account ofthe growing economic and financial integra-tion with western Europe, the role of theeuro is prominent, and tending to increase.

27Judging by past experience, exchange-rate
orientation proved its worth, especially duringthe nineties, as a major element in the stabil-isation policy of most transition countries.However, they were not able to dispense al-together with exchange-rate adjustments tooffset the cumulative loss of competitivenessresulting from inflation differentials, especiallyvis-7MyyH-vis the west European industrialised na-tions, which, although they have contracted,still continue to exist. Only small open econ-omies, such as – notably – Estonia, constitutean exception to this rule; it has consistentlyabided by the anchoring of the Estoniankroon to the Deutsche Mark and the eurounder the Currency Board.
For a number of candidate countries, a cer-
tain degree of exchange-rate flexibility seemsto remain necessary. Although the associatedcurrency risks must not be disregarded, theyare at the same time an effective protectionagainst speculative attacks – and one that isquite compatible with market conditions.That applies particularly if limited exchange-rate flexibility is accompanied by a steadystrengthening of the domesticpurc hasingpower of the national currencies concerned.The dilemma existing between exchange-rateflexibility and exchange-rate stability (whichcharacterises periods of relatively high infla-tion) resolves itself, so to speak, as conver-gence progresses: the growing internal stabil-ity of the respective national currencies sub-stantiates the greater stability of exchangerates. It is then, at the latest, that it seems tobe obvious why the candidate countries inquestion are adjusting their exchange-rate re-gimes to the requirements of participating inERM II. This is particularly true in the case of
completely flexible rates or of “crawlingpegs”.
According to the ideas of the Community,
which were approved by the EC most recentlyin Nice, the selection of the exchange-rate re-gime during the pre-accession phase is at thediscretion of each candidate country. In theprocess, care must be taken to ensure thatthe regime is consistent with the country’seconomic policy strategy, which, in particular,should serve macroeconomic stability andfoster lasting convergence. With their acces-sion to the EU, the new member states are re-quired, under Article 124, EC Treaty, to treattheir exchange-rate policy as a matter ofcommon interest. That means, among otherthings, that the exchange-rate links with cur-rencies other than the euro cannot be re-tained in the long run. In any case, participa-tion in ERM II is expected in due course. Cur-rency Board arrangements, buttressed by theeuro as the anchor currency, and imposingcorresponding commitments unilaterally onthe member state in question, are not neces-sarily at variance with that.
Incidentally, the candidate countries, by their
future participation in ERM II, are not merelyfulfilling a formal condition, without which,under the terms of the Treaty, subsequent ac-cession to the Eurosystem will not be pos-sible. Instead, such participation provides theappropriate monetary policy framework forthe phase of increasing convergence, in bothnominal and real terms. On the one hand,that mechanism certainly permits continuedexchange-rate adjustments, either by exploit-

28ing the margins of fluctuation (which, at
€ 15%, are decidedly wide) or by means offormal realignments. On the other hand, forthe currencies concerned, participation af-fords a certain protection against overly pro-nounced swings in short-term rates.
By contrast, any premature unilateral intro-
duction of the euro (“euroisation”) would beunwelcome in the eyes of the Community. Itwould run counter to accession to the Euro-system under the Treaty, which envisages theintroduction of the euro at the end of a struc-tured convergence process, and also presup-poses a mutual agreement on the appropriateexchange rates. Hence, after such a unilateralstep, the countries concerned could notcount on the support of the Eurosystem. Theywould therefore run the risk of relinquishingmonetary policy sovereignty without beingable to rely on the confidence-enhancing im-plications of participation in the Eurosystem.
From time to time, as an alternative strategy,
early accession to monetary union is pro-posed – earlier, that is, than is possible if theconditions set under the Treaty are compliedwith strictly. That – it is alleged – might great-ly expedite the convergence process. The sta-bilizing anchoring in the Eurosystem would– it is claimed – effectively protect the youngfinancial systems from monetary crises; itwould facilitate the deepening of economicand financial relations with other countriesand would assist the transition countries incombating inflation all round. Structurally-in-duced price rises in the catching-up processdue to productivity gains in the tradable-goods-producing sector pose, in the opinionof the advocates of this strategy, no risk to
the countries themselves, since they do notaffect the international competitiveness ofthe economy concerned. As regards price sta-bility in the euro area, they are negligible any-way, given the limited scale of the Balassa-Samuelson effect and the low economicweight of the candidate countries. From vari-ous quarters, it has therefore even been sug-gested that the road to monetary unionshould be “facilitated” by easing the require-ments for convergence under the Treaty.
Quite apart from the fact that inflation is nox-
ious even if it has no direct effects on inter-national competitiveness, this line of argu-ment is correct only in part. It is true that risesin the prices of non-tradables do not directlyimpair the international competitiveness ofthe country concerned. But, as the tertiarysector supplies intermediate inputs for indus-trial production, such rises play a role thatmust not be underrated in international com-petition between locations. Hence there areno grounds for being indifferent to pricerises, even if the underlying reasons aretraced back to sectoral productivity gains,which are characteristic of the real conver-gence process. For the rest, it should beborne in mind that inflation differentials be-tween catching-up economies and highly de-veloped economies cannot be ascribed to theaforementioned Balassa-Samuelson effectalone.
By a careful review of the sustainability of the
progress made towards convergence, thecandidate countries must therefore be pre-vented from “paying for” premature acces-

29sion to monetary union by means of lasting
competitive disadvantages. This implies, inter
alia, that price adjustments which may result
from essential reforms should have beencompleted by the time of accession to monet-ary union.
5In particular, care should be taken
to ensure that any transitional arrangementsexpire in good time, or are reviewed carefullyin the light of their potential implications forprice stability.
Furthermore, if the convergence were insuffi-
ciently sustainable, it would be difficult, oreven impossible, for a single monetary policyto do justice, at the same time, to the inter-ests of both the more mature economies andthe transition countries. This might engendertensions in the monetary policy decision-making process. That might well hamper asingle interest-rate policy oriented towardsthe needs of the entire monetary area.
It is also questionable whether premature ac-
cession to monetary union could really affordthe hoped-for protection from speculative at-tacks on the financial markets (not all ofwhich are fully developed) in some of thecandidate countries. Participation in thelarger currency area of the Eurosystemwould, by definition, avert the risk of crisesfor an individual national currency, as well asthe associated monetary risks. But the corres-ponding risk premiums would be reflected inthe interest-rate level, and possibly also in fi-nancing difficulties besetting the candidatecountry in question, rather than in the ex-change rate.Moreover, support and aid measures would
be possible at national level only on a verylimited scale. And, if the European authoritiesfelt obliged to counteract crisis-like develop-ments in one of the participating countries bymeans of appropriate liquidity assistance, aloss of reputation by the entire monetaryarea, and therefore by the euro as well, couldhardly be avoided. Within a monetary union,in particular, the risk of the contagion of re-gionally engendered financial market crisesappears especially great. Consequently, theability of individual member states to copewith the demands of the single monetary pol-icy becomes a matter of common concern.The convergence criteria of the MaastrichtTreaty take specific account of this conflictpotential, and thereby strengthen not onlycohesion in the monetary union but also in-vestors’ confidence in the common currency.This is why the Eurosystem makes particulardemands on the competitiveness and func-tionality of member states’ banking systems.
Summary
Being predominantly small open economies,
which already conduct more than half oftheir foreign trade with the European Union,the candidates for accession have a stronginterest in the stabilisation of their nominalexchange rates against the euro. However,exchange-rate stability that is to prove sus-tainable must be based on domesticstability.Premature accession to the Eurosystem thatwas not backed by adequate convergence

30might pose substantial risks to all those con-
cerned. It is essential, for the sake of all thoseinvolved, to prevent such consequent poten-tial tensions.
The application of the existing treaties – with-
out any further amendments – not onlyseems advisable on grounds of equity prior tothe selection of future members, it alsomakes economic sense. The Treaty providesfor clearly-defined steps towards integration,which build on one another, and for theimplementation of which specific conditionsmust be fulfilled. For instance, the so-calledCopenhagen criteria regulate accession tothe EU, but at the same time they must beviewed against the backdrop of subsequentparticipation in the joint monetary union. Thenominal convergence criteria, as conditionsfor participating in monetary union, supple-ment the political and real economic criteriaof the EU accession process, which must bemet beforehand.Real and nominal convergence must go hand
in hand in order to ensure, as far as possible,the tension-free functioning of the singlemonetary policy in an enlarged EMU. That isexpressly confirmed by the Treaty. Article 121of the EC Treaty not only lists the four often-specified nominal convergence criteria butalso covers the results of the integration ofmarkets, the situation and development ofthe balances of payments on current account,and the development of unit labour costs andother price indices. Thus, the criterion of suf-ficient real convergence does not constitutean additional obstacle to accession. In thefinal analysis, it is a matter of ensuring thesustainability of the convergence achieved,under the conditions of a unified monetarypolicy. The road to monetary union is mappedout clearly in the Treaty: just like the success-ful steps towards integration taken hitherto,the next steps, too, should be geared to thesame objectives.

ultimately concerned with evaluating finan-cial assets and liabilities. For their currentinvestment and portfolio decisions, marketparticipantsdevelop notionsof how price-relevant factorsare likely to change, res ultingin the expectationsbeing incorporated in thecorresponding direct quotations. Let us take,for instance, the case of an investor whoneedsto decide between two inves tmentseach of which isin a different currency. Hehasto take account in hiscalculationsnotonly of current domestic and foreign interestrates for the foreseeable investment period;he also needs to give due consideration tofuture exchange rateswhich might applywhen an investment denominated in a for-eign currency isexchanged back into hisdo-mestic currency. To hedge the foreign cur-rency risk, various instruments are availableon the forward and optionsmarketsat priceswhich represent, in essence, a market evalu-ation of that risk. Given certain conditions, in-formation on the density function can bederived from the direct quotationsfor thes einstruments. This makes it possible not onlyto determine the mean of the expectations,but also to assess market players’ expect-ationsthat a variable will exceed or fall belowspecific reference values.
Derivativefinancialinstrumentsand
indicators
Derivativesare normally defined asfinancial
instruments the prices of which are derivedfrom the value of a financial asset called theunderlying asset (in this case the US dollar/
euro exchange rate, see the box on page 33).
Common to derivative instruments is a con-
tractual clause which specifies the conditionsaccording to which the underlying trans-action will be processed in the future. Deriva-tives are classified according to whether thefuture transaction is definitive or optional.
The former category consists of forward
transactions in which the two contractingparties commit themselves to buy or sell theunderlying asset (in the example given here,the US dollar) at the agreed price when thecontract reachesmaturity. Depending on theactual spot rate development up to theagreed maturity date, this results in the risksof making a loss being balanced out againstthe chancesof making a profit. The agreedforward rate can be interpreted under specificconditionsasthe value of the future s pot rateexpected by the market.
The second category covers call options (put
options), by which the options buyer acquiresthe right (but not the obligation) to purchasethe underlying asset (here, the US dollar)from the option seller (to sell the underlyingasset to the option seller) at a price fixed inthe contract and at a specific date in thefuture. The market putsa value – the optionpremium – on the unilateral price change riskthus assumed by the option seller; the optionbuyer then paysthispremium to the optionseller. The amount of the premium is, ceteris
paribus , determined by the difference be-
tween the guaranteed strike price and the ex-pected change in the market price of the

33Optionprices–aglossary
Along with financial futuresand forward rate agree-
ments(FRAs ), optionsare a member of the family of
derivative instruments whose prices are “derived”
from changesin the price of another financial ins tru-
ment, called the “underlying” asset. Options are
traded either on exchanges under standardised terms
and conditionsor over the counter (OTC) with terms
and conditions tailored to customer needs. Deriva-
tives can be used for hedging, arbitrage or specula-
tive purposes, depending on market players’ inten-
tions and risk preferences. Option prices – also called
option premiums– are calculated us ing complex
mathematical formulae (option pricing models) which
are derived from hedging strategies and the absence
of arbitrage opportunities.
Call/put option: An option confersthe right, but
not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put op-
tion) a fixed amount of an underlying asset at a price
fixed in advance.
Strike price: The price fixed in the option at which
the option holder may exercise his/her option to buy
(sell) the underlying asset.
European/American option: In a European option,
the holder of the option may exercise it only on the
fixed expiry date. By contrast, the holder of an Ameri-
can option hasthe right to exercis e it on any day over
the entire duration up to the fixed expiry date.
In-the-money (ITM): A call (put) option isin-the-
money if the spot price of the underlying asset is
higher (lower) than the strike price. In this situation
the holder of a call (put) option can buy (sell) the un-
derlying asset from the option writer at the strike
price and then resell (buy) it on the spot market at
the current price, thereby making a profit.
Out-of-the-money (OTM): A call (put) option is
out-of-the-money if the spot price of the underlying
asset is higher (lower) than the strike price. For the
option holder it isnot worthwhile exercis ing the op-
tion.
At-the-money (ATM): A call (put) option isat-the-
money if the strike price is exactly equal to the spot
price of the underlying. The holder of the option
stands to neither gain nor lose from exercising the
option.
In the case of foreign exchange options where the
value of the underlying asset is a certain amount of
foreign currency, the ATM strike price often refers not
to the spot price of the underlying asset at the time
the deal isclos ed but to the current forward price of
the currency in question (“at-the-money forward”).Combinations
Call and put optionsare s tandard option contracts
which can be used to devise more complex combin-
ation strategies. Two widely used combined foreign
exchange instruments are the risk reversal and the
strangle.
Riskreversal : A combination of the parallel purchase
of an out-of-the-money call option and the sale of an
out-of-the-money put option. Both optionsexpire on
the same date and have strike prices which are equi-
distant in percentage terms from the forward rate at
the time the agreement isconcluded. The market
price of the risk reversal can be used to determine
whether market players’ assessments of the apprecia-
tion and depreciation potential of the exchange rate
are symmetrical.
Strangle: A combination of an out-of-the-money call
option and an out-of-the-money put option, with
both being held by the bearer. As in the risk reversal,
both options expire on the same date and have strike
priceswhich are equidis tant in percentage terms
from the forward rate at the time the agreement is
concluded. The quotation of the strangle may serve
asan indicator of extreme exchange rate fluctuations
compared with the log-normal distribution.
Implied volatility: In standard option price models,
the option premium for European optionscan be cal-
culated asa function of contractually s pecified vari-
ables(duration and s trike price), data obtainable di-
rectly from the market (interest rates and the spot
price of the underlying asset) and the expected vari-
ance of the underlying asset, which is not directly ob-
servable.
Under a given set of parameters, the price of an op-
tion in currency unitscorres pondsto exactly one vola-
tility value, which meansthat one variable may be
unambiguously derived from another. Implied volati-
lity is that particular volatility which – using the stan-
dard calculation method asa bas is– iscompatible
with the observed market price of the option. It
measures the expected price dispersion of the under-
lying instrument during the option’s duration. The
distinct mutual convertibility of option premium and
implied volatility using the standard option pricing
model led, in the special case of OTC foreign ex-
change options, to the convention of negotiating
implied volatilitiesdirectly ins tead of via option
premiums. In OTC trading, therefore, quotations are
given directly in unitsof implied volatility, or “vols ”,
which then imply a specific option premium.

34underlying asset over the time to maturity of
the option in line with the forward rate. Thisdifference is also called the intrinsic value ofthe option. Both call and put optionscan beclassified according to whether the currentconstellation of the expected future spot andstrike prices on the maturity date is associatedwith a profit or a (naturally, not realised) lossfor the option holder. In the first case an op-tion isreferred to asbeing “in-the-money”;in the second it is said to be “out-of-the-money”. If the expected spot price, or thespot price realised at maturity, is equal to thestrike price, the option is said to be “at-the-money”.
The method of deriving a density function
over the future exchange rate presented inthisarticle isbas ed on the pricesof four over-the-counter (OTC) derivative financial marketinstruments; the information content of eachinstrument is dealt with separately. This in-volvesquotationsfor the forward exchangerate, the at-the-money call option, the risk re-versal and the strangle (for the definition ofthese terms and the content of the respectivecontracts, see the box on page 33). Thesefour OTC market instruments are – unlikefloor-traded contracts, which have standard-ised maturity dates – all newly concludedcontracts with constant residual times (of, forexample, one or three months) to their ma-turity or settlement dates. As a general rule,new contractscan be concluded on any trad-ing day, meaning that the settlement date isdeferred by one day for each additional trad-ing day. The residual times to maturity inmost OTC contracts are specified in wholemonths up to one year. It is possible for alonger residual time to the settlement date to
be agreed but it israther unus ual. There isnomarket for contracts with a diminishing resi-dual time to maturity and no direct quota-tionsare therefore available for them. How-ever, offsetting transactions can be used toclose out the position during the residual ma-turity period.
“Classic” foreign exchange forward contracts
have long been used as a hedge against therisk of foreign exchange rate changes overthe term of a foreign currency investment. Ina perfect market, the principle of the absenceof arbitrage opportunitiesof internationalfinancial transactions leads to a forward ex-change rate which isfully determined by thecurrent spot rate and the difference betweeninterest rates in the domestic and externalmoney markets. Moreover, if investors arerisk-neutral, the forward rate determined inthismanner reflectsthe future s pot rate ex-pected by market players. If this were not thecase, foreign exchange dealers would resortto corresponding speculative transactions totry to absorb the difference between the for-ward rate and the expected spot rate until itiscompletely eradicated.
The foreign exchange forward rate may
therefore be used appropriately as an indica-tor of the expected future exchange rate.However, viewed retrospectively, for mostcurrency relationsthe correlation betweenthe expected exchange rate changesmeas -ured in thisway and the actual exchange ratechangesobs erved later israrely more thanweak.

content of market expectationsalone – con-densed by the forward rate to one point – islimited.
One explanation for thismay be that time-
varying risk premiums or the likelihood ofstructural shifts in the interrelation of curren-cies– which in a backward-looking analys isappear to be systematic – possibly play a rolein determining the forward rate.
One indicator which goesbeyond the point
forecast of the forward rate and provides in-formation about the relative dispersion of thefuture spot price of the underlying asset is theimplied volatility derived from the optionprices, of which it is an integral part, that areobservable on the market. This is based onthe calculation method used by market par-ticipantsto compute a no-arbitrage price foroptionswith a fixed exercis e date (Europeanoptions). To give a basic example, to calculatethe option premium the price volatility of theunderlying financial asset expected by marketparticipantsisincluded alongs ide negotiatedcontractual elements, such as time to matur-ity and the strike price, and variables directlyevident on the market, such as zero-risk inter-est rates and the current spot price of theunderlying asset. Conversely, it is thus pos-sible to calculate the implied volatility – whichcannot be ascertained directly but which is in-herent in the option price model – by usingthe option premium and the known variables.Asa general rule, although the calculation ofthe option premium isdependent on themethod used, for OTC currency options thereis a convention among dealers which consistsin the implied volatilitiesbeing cited directly
instead of the corresponding option prices orpremiums, with the requested option pre-miumstherefore being indicated only indir-ectly. Thisquotation practice isbas ed on theBlack-Scholesmodel adapted to calculate theforeign interest rate (although the validity ofthismodel isnot neces s arily accepted).
2The
indicator of expectation thusobs erved in themarket isa meas ure of the s ymmetrical per-centage fluctuation marginsof the future ex-change rate expected by market participants.The implied volatilitiestherefore provide in-formation about another important featureof the expectationsprevailing in the market.In addition to the information specific to theforward rate, the implied volatility isa meas -ure of the average future dispersion.

36be used by market analysts to gauge market
sentiment in this respect. This is a strategycombining standard option contracts, i.e. theparallel purchase of an out-of-the-money calloption and sale of an out-of-the-money putoption. If market participantscons ider itequally likely that the exchange rate couldmove by a specific percentage in either direc-tion, the risks incurred at both positions can-cel each other out, leaving the risk reversalprice at zero. By contrast, if the players on theforeign exchange market estimate the poten-tial loss incurred by a put option as a result ofthe exchange rate moving below the strikeprice asbeing higher than the potential profitincurred by a call option asa res ult of the ex-change rate moving above the strike price,the risk reversal has a negative value. In fact,it isclear that, over time, pricesquoted forthe risk reversal are frequently different fromzero, which meansthat expectationsofexchange rate changesmoving to a s pecificextent in one direction or another are asym-metrical.
Asexplained above, the implied volatility in
an at-the-money call or put option isa s tand-ardised parameter which, in the context oflog-normal distributed price changes, ad-equately describes the average deviation ofthe exchange rate from itsmean movement.However, if one triesto des cribe the totalrelative dispersion of the price changes in fi-nancial market data by thisvariable only, theimplied volatility of an at-the-money call op-tion, for instance, is inadequate because inreality extreme exchange rate volatilitiescanbe observed more frequently than might besuggested by the log-normal distribution.This can also be seen from the fact that the
implied volatility – contrary to the assump-tionsof the s tandard option price model – isa variable which changeswhen the under-lying conditions are otherwise constant andthe strike price varies, therefore preservingonly a local volatility measure dependent onthe strike price rather than a general meas-ure. Asa rule, the implied volatility increas esthe more remote the strike price, as estab-lished in the option, is from the forward rate(“volatility smile”). The inference is that mar-ket participantsexpect an exchange rate fluc-tuation margin above that which iscompat-ible with the implied volatility of an at-the-money call option. The direct quotationsofthe combination of simultaneously acquiredout-of-the-money call and put options,known asthe s trangle, are a meas ure ofthese major exchange rate fluctuations ex-pected by market participants. The holder ofthisins trument only receivesa pay-off at ma-turity if the exchange rate isabove the s trikeprice of the call option or below that of theput option. Because the options considered inthe context of the strangle are out-of-the-money at the time of purchase (i.e. in thecase of call options, the forward rate is belowthe strike price), the presupposition is that ex-change rateswill have changed markedly bythe exercise date. The willingness to pay forthe strangle therefore increases with the riskperceived by market playersof an exceptionalexchange rate development up to maturity,with the result that the uncertainty assess-ment based on the observed implied volatilitymay be appropriately supplemented by theinformation which can be derived from theprice quotationsfor thisins trument.

37Impliedrisk-neutraldensityfunctions
The bitsand piecesof information contained
in the price quotationsof the aforementionedderivative foreign exchange instruments canbe gathered together by calculating an im-plied density; it is not necessary to resort tothe use of structural information such as acertain random process for the price develop-ment of the underlying asset or a certain op-tion pricing model.
3This is possible since, as-
suming that investors are risk-neutral, thevalue of an option corresponds to the currentvalue of the expected payment to the holderof the option discounted at the risk-free inter-est rate. Thus, an option premium implicitlyreflects the probability assumed by marketplayersthat the s pot rate of the underlyingasset will be higher or lower than the fixedstrike price at the expiry date. If at a certainpoint in time there are several quotations foroptionswith varying s trike pricesfor a certainunderlying asset, each of the implied individ-ual probabilitiesmay be us ed to approximatean implied density; the precision of these esti-matesincreas esproportionately to the num-ber of options with varying exercise prices. Inan ideal case, a continuum of different optionpremiumscan be extracted from the marketand used to derive the exact implied densityfunction.
In the real world of OTC foreign exchange

All densities presented in the chart have the

The advantage of representing these simul-
taneously captured market quotations as animplied density function is that complex infor-mation can be presented in a comprehensiblemanner. Not only the mean market expect-ation but also the potentially asymmetrical or– in termsof the log-normal dis tribution – ex-treme range of the expectationsaround theexpected value are filtered out of the data.Those using the implied risk-neutral densitythusno longer need to res ort to interpretinga point expectation but can see the overallpicture of market opinion at a glance.
However, caution iswarranted when inter-
preting risk-neutral density functions andtheir significance. It must not be forgottenthat the relative unavailability of optionswithvarious strike prices and the consequent needto resort to an interpolation procedure con-siderably reduce the informative value of themethod. When choosing the option prices tobe used for the computation, it should be en-sured that the quotations used are actuallysufficiently liquid and therefore representa-tive. In addition, it would be desirable to basethe computation on the widest possiblerange of observations. Particularly the deriva-tive pricesof optionsthat are far out-of-the-money or far in-the-money – called “wingoptions” – could improve the informationcontent of the calculated density functions.But this is often where the trouble lies, sinceit is precisely those wing options that are like-
ly to be best suited to more accuratelygauging market expectationsof potential ex-treme swings which are either not availableat all or contain high liquidity premiumswhich distort market expectations of futureprice developments. When using the methodexplained here to calculate density functions,therefore, often the only available avenue isto use relatively closely at-the-money optionpremiumswhich are generally comparativelyliquid, making it possible to disregard thedistortions they cause. However, caution iswarranted when making interpretationsthatrelate to probabilitiesouts ide the range of thedensity function spread out by the strikeprices of the strangles and risk reversals used.
The calculation and interpretation of risk-
neutral density functions could also lead toproblemsif, in certain market s ituations , thereare sudden surges in demand which are re-flected in sharp fluctuations in the premiumsfor standard option contracts. As a case inpoint, there isa s trong reciprocity betweenstandard derivatives and specialised or “exot-ic” optionswhich cover price ris k only up tocertain upper or lower limits(“knock-out” or“knock-in” options) and cease to function asinsurance once the spot rate reaches the bar-riersfixed in the contracts . If a large numberof these thresholds are close together at agiven point in time because, for instance,they match certain technical-analysis-based“resistance lines”, then, if the borderline isunexpectedly exceeded, the dealers, nowopenly exposed to price risks, may well de-mand such a large quantity of hedging instru-ments that the prices in question will rise

of these instruments. In such a situation boththe holdersof the knock-out options , es pe-cially the option sellers in question, who, bybuying standard option contracts in such asituation, are trying to cap the potential lossof the hedging positions they entered into inconnection with the sale of the knock-outoptions. The meaningfulness of the derivativefinancial market pricesand the dens ity func-tion extracted from them islimited in timesofsuch “technical” market disruptions.

When interpreting the risk-neutral densitiesaspure meas uresof probability, however, thesame caveats apply as those that need to beobserved when interpreting the forward rateasan expected value of the future s pot rate.As the name suggests, these are density func-tions derived under the assumption that in-vestors are risk-neutral. This ignores the factthat investors will generally demand a pre-mium for incurring risk and tend more to-wards risk-aversion rather than risk-neutrality.Only under the assumption of market partici-pants’ risk-neutrality, however, are the“pure” probabilitiesof future exchange ratedevelopmentsreflected in the calculateddensities. Otherwise, they additionally con-tain a component influenced by the individualrisk preferences, which cannot be separatelycaptured and isolated. In practice, the quanti-tative importance of risk premiums tends tobe small and quite possibly affects the meanbut not the form of the density, so the distor-tionsthat could occur in the ris k-neutraldensities when calculating according to themethod described here are not very large.That is especially the case if one focuses lesson the specific density function and more on
itschange over time.
Possibleuse
Taking the aforementioned limitationsinto
account, however, the implied risk-neutraldensity functions and their changes can un-doubtedly be used to derive important infor-mation on the pattern of the market players’expectations and risk assessments. Four ex-amples have been selected to illustrate thisphenomenon. They concern the influence onmarket players’ exchange rate expectationsof

comparison of the two risk-neutral densitiesbefore and after intervention shows that theprobability of extreme events(meas ured intermsof the value of the s trangle) wasnot af-fected by the intervention operations, where-as the market players’ assessment of the gen-eral dispersion of the future exchange rate(in the sense of the implied volatility of theat-the-money call option) rose slightly; therightward-leaning density prior to interventionon the foreign exchange market (captured bythe negative price of the risk reversal)straightened up and had a mean value thathad shifted distinctly to the right. Thus, afterintervention – given the virtual absence of anincrease in uncertainty – the market playersexpected the exchange rate of the euro to besomewhat higher one month later than in thepre-central bank intervention scenario anddid not rate the risk of a pronounced devalu-ation of the euro any higher than that of theeuro appreciating by the same amount.

42dayslater, the aforementioned changesin the
calculated density had already receded.
The expectations indicator, besides studying
how the central bank’sown ins trumentswork, also affords the possibility of studyinghow other market-relevant factorsand eventsinfluence market players’ assessments. In Oc-tober 2000, ass ignsof a gradual economicslump in the United states were mounting,provisional data on US economic growth inthe third quarter of 2000 were published. At2.7%, growth lagged far behind the 3.5%expected by market analysts. The chart onpage 41 shows the change in the impliedrisk-neutral densities under the cloud of thisnew information. On the day after the an-nouncement, the mean expectation of the USdollar/euro exchange rate one month laterwass omewhat higher than that prior to pub-lication. At the same time the market assess-ment of price risks on both sides – after hav-ing been biased more towards depreciationthan towardsappreciation by the s ameamount – tended to be symmetrical. Themeasures of the mean fluctuation marginsand of extreme price fluctuations, however,remained unaffected.
On this side of the Atlantic, it was possible to
observe a similar yet opposite reaction to theannouncement of unexpectedly bad businessfigures. In March 2001 the Ifo Institute an-nounced that the German Business ClimateIndex had dropped by a surprisingly largemargin (3.1 index points, although analystshad predicted that the drop would only be0.5%). This distinct worsening of the assess-ment of the business situation in Germanyalso left its mark on market expectations of
the outlook for exchange rates. In concreteterms, the mean expectation for the US dollarrate waspus hed s lightly downward, and therisk-neutral density tended to continue tolean more closely towards devaluation. More-over, market playerss eemed to be generallyless certain, since the mean range of futureexchange rate fluctuationsexpanded s lightly.Only the fatness at the tails, and thus theassessment of extraordinary exchange ratemovements, remained unchanged followingthe announcement of the index value.
The 11 September terrorist attack in the
United Stateshad a s evere impact on marketplayers’ US dollar/euro exchange rate expect-ations. In the period prior to the attack theUS dollar regained some of the ground it hadlost owing to the gloomier outlook for eco-nomic growth in the United States. This wasthe environment shaken by the news of theattacksin New York City and Was hington.The chart on page 41 containsthe impliedrisk-neutral density function computed fromoption pricesimmediately preceding the at-tacksand from market pricesone week after-wards(s ince US financial marketshad beenclosed for a time immediately after the at-tack). Unlike in the pre-terrorist attack assess-ment, after 11 September market playersex-pected the spot rate of the euro to be higherone month later. The general assessment ofrisk shot upwards at the same time. In purelyarithmetic termsthe value of the impliedvolatility was30% higher than before the at-tack. In the chart thisisevident in the “moreducked” and wider span of the density. Theprobability of extreme exchange rate fluctu-

43ationsincreas ed aswell. That isevinced by
the density having fatter tails. Moreover, themarket, which even before the attack hadtended to expect the euro to appreciate dis-tinctly rather than to depreciate by the sameamount, gave a higher assessment of the po-tential for asymmetrical exchange rate move-ments. The value of the risk reversal, whichdeterminesthe extent of the s ymmetry break,doubled asa res ult of the events . In the chart,this is shown by the density leaning morestrongly to the left.
At the same time, though, this example
makesit clear that caution iswarranted wheninterpreting thisindicator. Asmentionedabove, risk premiums, which are factored outwhen calculating the densities, may haveplayed a considerable role in the days follow-ing 11 September. Moreover, even one weekafter the attack, the liquidity situation in theOTC market for foreign-exchange optionsinLondon had not returned to normal – the ra-ther high bid-ask spreads for otherwise quiteaccessible instruments were a visible sign ofthis – meaning that the market assessmentscould not be es timated as“accurately” asis
usually possible.
Summaryandevaluation
Financial market pricesgive a central bank ac-
cess to information about how the marketplayers assess the future at any given time.Thisknowledge isimportant to monetary pol-icy practitioners. However, it is neither usefulnor possible to apply indicators mechanistical-ly. Uncertainty surrounding the capture andconversion of the observed market prices intoexpectation indicators argue against such anapproach; financial market data are at timesbuffeted by special institutional factors or canbe distorted by market tension. It will there-fore be necessary to continue to reassess themeaningfulness of the presented risk-neutraldensity function and to apply it to other fi-nancial markets. Experience with it will permiteconomists to make a more broadly based as-sessment of the instrument described in theforegoing and itsability to des cribe marketexpectations.

OTCquotations
In OTC trading, pricesof foreign exchange options
are expressed as implied volatilities, which are thenconverted by dealersus ing the Garman-Kohlhagenformula (the Black-Scholesformula adapted to cal-culate foreign currency interest) into the price incurrency units, called an option premium, to settletheir transactions. The use of the Garman-Kohlhagen formula ismerely a market conventionand doesnot imply that market participantsneces -sarily accept the validity of the underlying model.Thisconvention enhancesmarket trans parency andsimplifies settlement since – in contrast to quota-tion using currency units – the exchange rates onthe spot market, which change minute by minute,do not necessarily cause the price expressed involatility unitsto react. Ideally, the option pricesquoted in thisfas hion merely reflect dealers ’ chan-ging subjective volatility assessments. The Garman-Kohlhagen option pricing formula can be writtenasfollows :
c(S
t,t,X ,s,r ,r * )=e–r*tStF(d1)–e–rtXF(d2)
where (1)
d1 = ln(St / X) + (r – r* +      ) τ
σ√τσ2
2
d2 = d1 – σ√τ
where S tisthe s pot rate at the time the option
contract isconcluded, tthe time to maturity, X the
strike price of the option, r the domestic interestrate and r* the foreign currency interest rate. F(.)
is the cumulative standard normal distribution. Theparameter ssymbolises the expected price volatil-
ity of the underlying asset of the option duringtime to maturity t, and c(.) isthe option premium
to be agreed given thisexpected volatility. Asthecontract-specific elements S
t,t, X, r and r* are
known when the contract isconcluded, the optionpricing formula, given the option premium c(.), im-pliesprecis ely one value for swhich can solve
equation (1). Therefore the variable sisals o called
implied volatility, although the term may in somecases be misleading in connection with OTC for-eign exchange options, since in that case dealersnegotiate sdirectly and thusconvers ely imply an
option premium c(.).
According to conventionsamong dealers , the
strike price is likewise not expressed in currencyunits but in deltas, which measure the sensitivity ofoption pricesto changesin the price of the under-lying asset, which in this case is the exchange rate.Since, ceteris paribus , the option’sdelta decreas es
continuously as strike prices rise, the strike priceand the option’sdelta are unambiguous ly connect-ed, which meansone can be trans formed into theother using the Garman-Kohlhagen formula. Theadvantage of expressing the strike price as delta isthat the “distance” between the strike price andthe current forward rate isnormalis ed. Thismeansthat contracts with the same delta always showforward rate/strike price constellations with, intermsof the forward rate, the s ame percentagedistance between the strike price and the forwardrate. Specifically, in out-of-the-money call options(in-the-money call options) the contracting partiesmostly select strike prices such that they corres-

1.
OTCquotationsforcombinationsThisquotation convention exis tsnot only for
standard option contracts (call and put options)but also for various combinations such as the riskreversal and the strangle.
A risk reversal is a combination of the purchase of
a call option and the sale of a put option, the strikeprice deltasof which (here: d= 0.25 for the call
option, d= – 0.25 for the put option) are equidis-
tant from the forward rate. Itsprice therefore cor-responds to the difference, expressed in impliedvolatility units or “vols”, between the two instru-ments used to construct it (see the glossary onpage 33). The formula for the quotation of a riskreversal is expressed as:
RR
td=0.25=std=0.25–std=0.75,
where std=0.25(std=0.75) represents the implied
volatility price of a call option (put option) with adelta of 0.25 (– 0.25).
8
A strangle is the parallel purchase (or sale) of a calland put option with – in absolute terms – thesame delta (see the glossary on page 33). The price
of this combination is expressed as the deviation ofthe average of the call and put optionscontainedtherein from the price of an at-the-money call op-tion.
The formula is:
ST
td=0.25=0 . 5( std=0.25+std=0.75)–st“at-the-money”,
where st“at-the-money”isthe implied volatility price
of an at-the-money call option.
Rearranging termswill enable usto take the mar-
ket prices of the risk reversal and the strangle andto deduce from them the implied volatilitiesof thecall options underlying those combinations, thedelta of which is0.25 and 0.75, res pectively:
s
td=0.25=S Ttd=0.25+st“at-the-money”+0 . 5R R td=0.25
std=0.75=S Ttd=0.25+st“at-the-money”–0 . 5R R td=0.25
Besides the quotation of the at-the-money call op-
tion ( st“at-the-money”) with a delta of around 0.5,
there are now two additional option pricesex-pressed in implied volatilities with strike pricesexpressed in delta.

46sumed that the non-observed volatility prices of
optionswith differing levelsof delta form a s ickle-shaped pattern around the at-the-money call op-tion, so they can be approximated by a parabola.Thisnon-linear arrangement of the implied volatil-ity prices is also called the volatility smile. In alge-braic terms, this phenomenon can be expressed asa second-order polynomial:
s
d
t=a0+a1d+a2d2,
where sd
tdenotesthe implied volatility price of a
call option with a delta d. Since thisequation only
containsthree variables a0,a1,a2, it can be unam-
biguously solved at any point in time using thethree simultaneously observed OTC quotations ofthe at-the-money call option, the risk reversal andthe strangle.
II. Transformation into an option price function
where the strike price is continuous
Using the Garman-Kohlhagen formula in (1), every
d/squotation can be numerically assigned to a
pair consisting of the strike price X and the optionpremium c(.) with the same informative value. Inthe following, it will be shown that numerically dif-ferentiating the option premiumstwice with re-spect to the strike price will lead to the desired im-plied probability distribution.
III. Implied risk-neutral density functionThe option premium c(t, X, T) of a European call
option with the strike price X and time to maturityt= T-t at time t isthe res ult, if market playersare
risk-neutral, of discounting the expected value ofthe option’spay-offsat the date of expiry T by theinterest rate r of a risk-free investment. Since a calloption isonly exercis ed if price movementsare fa-vourable, i.e. only if the exchange rate S
Tishigher
than the strike price X, the value of the option isbetween zero and the difference between the ex-change rate S
Tand the strike price X on the date
of expiry. The formula for thisis :
c(t, X, T) = e–rτ E[max (ST – X), 0]
= e–rτ ∫(ST – X) π(ST) d(ST),      (2)∞
X
where p(ST) isthe probability dens ity function over
the set of potential realisations of S Tassumed by
dealersat the time of the trans action. Thismeansthat the observable option prices c(.) imply infor-mation on the density functions assumed by deal-ers. The information content increases in line witha rise in the number of independent option pre-miumsfor optionswith varying s trike priceswhichmay be taken from the market. In an ideal case, acontinuousfunction isavailable. In that cas e, it ispossible to extract the implied probability densityfunction by numerically differentiating (2) twicewith respect to the strike price X. Taking the firstderivative of the option price function yieldsthefollowing relationship:
= – e–rτ ∫π(ST) d(ST)
= – e–rτ [1– Π(X)]
= – e–rτ P(ST > X),∞
X∂c(t, X, T)
∂X
where P(ST) isthe cumulative dis tribution function
over the set of possible realisations of S Tand
P(ST> X) the probability that the exchange rate
will exceed the strike price X on the day of matur-ity. If the first derivative is evaluated at two differ-ent pointsX
1and X 2, the difference between P(X 1)
and P(X 2) (where P(X 1) > P(X 2)) may be used to cal-
culate the probability implied by market playersthat S
Twill be between X 1and X 2. For infinitesi-
mally small variations in the strike price this prob-

ing the option price function twice with respect tothe strike price
= e–rτ π(X).      (3)∂2c(t, X, T)
∂X2
The second derivative of the option price function
therefore corresponds to the (discounted) value ofthe probability density function over the set of real-isations of S
T, evaluated at strike price X.
Asmentioned above, the practical implementation
of thisapproach to calculating the implied ris k-neutral probability density functions causes a prob-lem: there exists neither a uniform analytical op-tion price formula nor a large number of marketprices for options with different strike prices.Through the interpolation in I and the step-by-stepmathematical transformation in II, a continuum ofoption premiumsc(t, X, T) at varying s trike pricesXis established. By forming the difference quotientfor, in principle, infinitely small step sizes, the dif-ference quotient in (3) isapproximated. The nu-merically derived cumulative distribution function
Pˆ(X) iscalculated asfollows :
Πˆ (X) = 1 + erτ [                          ]c(t, X, T) – c(t, X – ∆X, T)
∆X
wherec(t, X, T) – c(t, X – ∆X, T)
∆X isthe firs t-order difference
quotient of the numerically existing option pricefunction and DX the step size of the discrete differ-
ences(which can be made infinitely s mall). Thefirst-order difference quotient of the cumulativedistribution function pˆ (X) then yieldsthe des ired
implied risk-neutral probability density functionPˆ(X):
πˆ(X) = Πˆ (X) – Πˆ (X – ∆X)
∆X
When interpreting the implied probabilities
gleaned in thismanner, however, it mus t be bornein mind that information on the mass of probabil-itiesbetween and beyond the areasdefined by thestrike prices of traded options is chiefly dependenton the method of interpolation. That isparticularlytrue of the two endsof the probability dens ityfunction.
