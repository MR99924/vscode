Economic conditions
Underlying trends
Economic output in Germany in the final quar -
ter of 2012 is unlikely to match the level of ac-
tivity in the summer months. Following a sea-
sonally adjusted 0.2% rise in gross domestic 
product (GDP) in the third quarter, the current 
indicators point to a marked fall in overall out-
put towards the end of the year. The current 
general tendency to weakness is due mainly to industry, which cut back its production consid-
erably during the period under review. This is 
true, above all, of capital goods manufacturers, who are suffering from a marked reluctance on 
the part of domestic and export customers to 
buy new machinery and equipment. While home and euro-area demand for industrial 
goods is still pointing downwards, significantly 
more orders have come from non-euro-area 
countries lately, among which were a number 
of large-scale orders. One positive factor is that 
export expectations have moved back into positive territory again. Along with the im
-
provement in enterprises’ business expect -
ations, this might indicate that the dip in eco -
nomic activity in Germany could soon be over -
come.
Industry
After what was already a large fall in Septem -
ber, industrial output fell again sharply in Octo-
ber by a seasonally adjusted 2½% on the month. This was 3¾% down on the average 
output of the third quarter, which showed an 
elevated level owing to the fact that a number 
of automotive manufacturers did not shut 
down their plants during this period. Output of capital goods in October was as much as 6½% 
down on the third quarter. This was not due 
solely to the exceptional development in the 
automotive industry, however; there was a considerable decline (-4%) in the other capital 
goods industries, too. Producers of intermedi -
ate goods cut back their production by 2½%, 
while consumer goods output was only slightly 
down on the average level of the third quarter (-½%).
Following a decidedly poor figure for Septem -
ber, however, German industry’s intake of 
orders showed a sharp seasonally adjusted in -
crease of 3¾% in October. This was 2% higher 
than the average level of the third quarter. This 
growth was admittedly concentrated on non-
euro-area countries’ demand for intermediate 
and capital goods, in which large-scale orders 
were also a factor. This contrasted with domes-
tic orders and orders from other euro-area 
countries, which persisted on a downward trend. Orders from the rest of the euro area were 2% down on their average level of the 
preceding quarter; domestic orders were down by 1½%. Overall, due in part to the large-scale 
orders, there was a sharp 3¼% decline in de -
mand for capital goods. Intermediate goods 
orders were slightly higher (+¼%) than in the 
third quarter, and orders of consumer goods 
went up by 1%.
Domestic and export sales of German industrial 
goods showed a month-on-month fall in Octo-ber. The figure was 2½% down overall on the 
average of the third quarter. There was an es -
pecially sharp decline of 4½% in sales of capital goods. Sales of intermediate goods were down 
by 1½%, but consumer goods showed a 1% 
rise. Although the value of exported goods was somewhat higher in October than it had been 
in September, it was still ¾% down on the 
average of the previous quarter. In contrast to 
exports, nominal imports showed a sharp in -
crease on their weak September figure at +2½%, and there was also a significant in
-
crease of 1¾% compared with the average of 
the third quarter.Decline in GDP

Construction
According to the official statistics, the level of 
construction activity in October was 5¼% 
lower than in September after seasonal adjust-
ment. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the 
October figure is based on a new reporting 
population, which means that it is not directly 
comparable with the data for the preceding 
months. There was a sharp decline in the in -
flow of orders in September (more recent data 
are not yet available), mainly in building con -
struction. In the third quarter as a whole, build-
ing construction still showed a marked increase on the second quarter, however, while civil en-gineering orders fell sharply.
Labour market
The labour market has been characterised by a 
sideways movement since the summer. The 
seasonally adjusted number of persons in work 
in Germany in October remained at the same 
level as in the previous month. The year-on-
year figure showed an increase of 279,000, or 0.7%. In September, the figure for employment 
subject to social security contributions was 
exactly the same as in July and August. As be-
fore, a sharp decline in temporary unemploy -
ment contrasted with positive developments in 
business-related services (excluding temporary 
agency employment) and in the health and education sectors. Employment was largely stable in the manufacturing sector. The year-on-year increase in employment in the econ
-
omy as a whole was 407,000, or 1.4%. So far, there has been only a slow rise in the number 
of registrations for short-time working. The outlook for the labour market did not show any further deterioration at the end of the 
period under review. According to the Ifo em-
ployment barometer, firms’ willingness to re -
cruit new staff increased considerably in No -
vember, and there was no additional fall in the Federal Employment Agency’s BA-X job index.Construction

The official unemployment figure went up 
again slightly to a seasonally adjusted 2.94 mil-
lion in November. The unemployment rate 
(using the Federal Employment Agency’s defin-
ition) remained at 6.9%. The rise was concen-
trated on short-term unemployment. The re -
porting period saw a seasonally adjusted in -
crease in total underemployment (excluding short-time work) as recorded by the Federal 
Labour Agency for the first time since summer 
2009, however. In the reporting month, the 
relevant figure was as much as 113,000 down 
on the year, while the official unemployment figure showed a year-on-year increase of 
38,000.
Prices
The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil was steady during the month of November. At US$108¾, it was 2% below the previous 
month’s average. There was hardly any change 
in the first half of December either. A likely additional factor is that Saudi Arabia is ex
-
pected to have a stabilising role in the oil mar -
ket even in an environment of weak demand. 
The latest information from OPEC is that Saudi 
Arabian production has already been cut back 
again recently. As this report went to press, the price of a barrel of crude oil stood at US$107¾. 
Crude oil futures were still being quoted at 
marked discounts of just under US$4 for deliv-eries six months ahead and US$6½ for deliver -
ies 12 months ahead.
Import prices fell in total by a seasonally ad -
justed 0.2% on the month in October. Domes-tic producer prices likewise declined somewhat (-0.1%). While the price of energy came down, 
industrial goods became more expensive. The 
overall annual rate of increase for both import and producer prices fell to 1.5%.
Seasonally adjusted consumer prices showed a 
moderate increase of 0.2% in November com-pared with the previous month. Whereas fuels 
became cheaper, foods became more expen -sive owing to prices for dairy and meat prod -
ucts. The prices of other goods and services increased somewhat. According to both the national CPI and the HICP , the annual rate of inflation fell to 1.9% after 2.0% and 2.1% re
-
spectively.
Public finances1
Statutory health  
insurance scheme
In the third quarter, the statutory health insur -
ance institutions and the health insurance fund 
posted a combined surplus of €2 billion, com-
pared with a positive result of nearly €2½ bil -
lion one year previously. Almost €1½ billion of 
the current surplus was posted by the statutory 
health insurance institutions (as at the same stage in 2011), while the health insurance 
fund’s positive result was halved to €½ billion. 
The statutory health insurance system as a whole recorded noticeably weaker growth in 
revenue (just over 2%) than in expenditure (just over 3%).
At just over 3%, the statutory health insurance 
institutions’ revenue (predominantly transfers 
from the health insurance fund) grew at almost 
the same rate as their expenditure. After a tem-porary slowdown in the second quarter, spend-
ing thus accelerated somewhat in the third 
quarter. This notably concerned expenditures in 
areas such as home nursing, medication and medical aids as well as transportation costs. 
Outlays on hospital treatment went up sharply, not least owing to an ongoing steep rise in the number of cases treated. By contrast, spending 
on pharmaceuticals remained subdued. This 
was due in part to discount and new fixed-
amount agreements with manufacturers. But Continuing

phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain a detailed description of 
the development of public finances during the preceding 
quarter. For detailed data on budgetary developments and public debt, see the statistical section of this report.Deutsche Bundesbank

as the total growth in spending in the first nine 
months of 2012 (just over 3%) was distinctly 
lower than the figure (+4½%) projected by the 
group of statutory health insurance estimators 
in autumn 2011, which determines the level of 
transfers from the health insurance fund, the 
statutory health insurance institutions were able to accumulate a surplus of just over €4 
billion by the end of the third quarter. As a re-
sult, the statutory health insurance institutions 
currently hold reserves of €14 billion.
As in the first two quarters, the health insur -
ance fund’s expenditure (primarily transfers to 
the statutory health insurance institutions) 
grew significantly faster (3½%) than its revenue 
(2½%). Although contributions increased by 
3½% thanks to the continuing favourable em-ployment and wage trends, transfers from the central government budget fell markedly. They will decrease from €15.3 billion in 2011 to €14 billion in 2012 as a whole. With a virtually bal-
anced result after the first three quarters, the health insurance fund’s reserves stood at 
around €9½ billion at the end of September.
In light of the expenditure trend in the third 
quarter, the statutory health insurance institu -
tions look likely to record a slightly lower 
full-year surplus than in 2011 (€4 billion). Owing to the traditional large contribution receipts at the end of the year, the health insurance fund 
is expected to post a considerable surplus, al -
beit noticeably lower than in 2011 (almost €5½ 
billion). The overall statutory health insurance 
system is therefore likely to once more record a very large surplus, though it will be somewhat smaller than the record result achieved in 2011 (+€9½ billion).
In 2013, the Federal Government will reduce its 
transfers to the health insurance fund by €2½ billion. Even if, in line with the government co-alition’s agreements of November, the transfers 
are increased again by €½ billion in 2014, the 
fund will still be €2 billion down compared with the long-term target of €14 billion. Fur
-
thermore, as of 2013, the financial burden will rise by almost €2 billion owing to the abolition of the surgery visit charge for outpatient treat-ment, which is to be offset through higher allo-
cations to the statutory health insurance insti -
tutions from the health insurance fund. More -
over, as the expenditure of the statutory health 
insurance system, if further countermeasures are not taken, could rise faster than gross 
wages and salaries and hence contribution re-ceipts, the surplus position is likely to be quickly 
eroded. For the time being, however, the health insurance fund’s current large reserves 
will enable it to fully cover the statutory health insurance institutions’ expenditure. Yet over the 
medium term, pressure to raise the general 
contribution rate or to levy additional contribu-tions will increase again.Health fund’s

Public long-term care 
 insurance scheme
The public long-term care insurance scheme 
posted a slight deficit in the third quarter, 
which was somewhat up on the year. This de-
velopment was brought about by a significant 
increase of almost 4% in total receipts and a 
spending rise of a similar magnitude. Employ -
ees’ contributions grew by 4% as a result of the favourable pay and employment trends. Pensioner contributions went up faster than 
before by almost 2% owing to the higher mid-year pension adjustment. The raising of benefit rates by nearly 2% on average at the beginning of 2012 was a major factor in the acceleration of expenditure.
Despite a deterioration in the financial situation 
up to the end of September, a surplus – albeit a small one – could be posted again for the full 
year. A temporary improvement is expected in 
2013 as the additional revenue from raising the contribution rate from 1.95% to 2.05% (plus an extra 0.25% in each case for childless persons) is likely to be initially higher than the additional 
expenditure resulting from broadening the 
range of benefits. However, against the back -
drop of an ageing population, a structural def-
icit in the financial position of the public 
long-term care insurance scheme is likely to de-velop in the longer term.

Securities markets
Bond market
In October 2012, the issue volume in the Ger -
man bond market stood at €120.9 billion in 
gross terms (previous month: €105.2 billion). 
After deducting redemptions, which were 
down slightly, and taking account of changes 
in issuers’ holdings of their own bonds, the vol-
ume of outstanding domestic bonds increased by €2.9 billion. In addition, foreign debt secur -
ities worth €3.8 billion net were sold in the 
German market.The public sector issued €12.5 billion worth of 
bonds in the capital market in the reporting month. Central government (including the 
resolution agency which is classified as part of central government) accounted for €6.5 billion of this figure. It issued mainly ten-year Federal 
bonds (Bunds) and two-year Federal Treasury 
notes (Schätze) for €7.1 billion and €6.4 billion 
respectively, but also Treasury discount paper 
(Bubills) worth €2.5 billion. This contrasted with 
net redemptions of five-year Federal notes 
(Bobls) for €11.3 billion. In the month under re-view, the state governments tapped the capital market for €6.0 billion net.
On balance, the outstanding amount of debt 
securities issued by domestic credit institutions 
decreased by €4.0 billion in October. Public Gradual worsen-

Pfandbriefe, in particular, were redeemed for 
€6.0 billion and also, to a lesser extent, mort -
gage Pfandbriefe and other bank debt secur -
ities (€1.2 billion and €0.8 billion respectively). 
Only debt securities issued by specialised credit 
institutions were sold in the market (€4.0 bil -
lion net).
Domestic enterprises redeemed €5.7 billion net 
worth of own bonds in the month under re -
view. This amount was divided almost evenly 
between bonds with a maturity of more than 
one year and those with less than one year.Domestic non-banks were the main purchasers 
in October. They added, on balance, €12.1 bil-lion worth of bonds to their portfolios. Foreign securities accounted for €6.9 billion of this fig-
ure. Non-resident investors’ purchases of do -
mestic debt securities totalled a net €4.9 bil -
lion. By contrast, domestic credit institutions 
divested themselves, on balance, of €8.8 billion worth of bonds, mainly domestic securities.Equity market
In October, domestic enterprises issued new shares for €0.1 billion in the German equity market. The outstanding amount of foreign 
shares in the German market also increased, by 
€7.8 billion. Equities were purchased by all groups of purchasers, on balance. Above all, domestic non-banks, but also German credit institutions, added equities to their portfolios (for €4.4 billion and €3.0 billion net respect
-
ively). Foreign investors purchased equities is -
sued by domestic enterprises for €0.6 billion on balance.
Mutual funds
In October, domestic mutual funds sold shares totalling €6.5 billion net in the German market 
(€3.0 billion in the previous month). On bal -
ance, fresh funds were injected mainly into specialised funds reserved for institutional in
-
vestors (€6.1 billion). Of the mutual funds open 
to the general public, it was mainly mixed 
funds (€0.3 billion) as well as open-end real es-
tate funds and mixed securities-based funds 
(€0.2 billion and €0.1 billion respectively) which 
recorded net inflows. In the reporting month, 
foreign funds traded in the German market 
sold shares to the tune of €3.4 billion. Domes-
tic non-banks were the sole net purchasers, 
adding on balance €10.3 billion in mutual fund 
shares to their portfolios. By contrast, foreign investors and resident credit institutions dis
-
posed of shares with a value of €0.3 billion and €0.1 billion net respectively.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur -
plus – in unadjusted terms – of €13.6 billion in

tions, which comprise services, income and 
current transfers.
According to provisional figures released by the 
Federal Statistical Office, in October the foreign trade surplus went down by €1.1 billion on the 
month to €15.8 billion. After adjustment for 
seasonal and calendar variations, it decreased 
by €1.6 billion to €15.2 billion. The value of ex-
ports rose only marginally, by 0.3%, while the 
value of imports climbed at a much stronger 
rate of 2.5%. Compared with the third-quarter 
average, seasonally adjusted nominal exports 
fell by 0.6% whereas imports were up by 1.7% 
in October. Price effects, both in terms of rev -
enue and expenditure, played only a minor 
role.
Invisible current transactions posted a modest 
surplus of €0.1 billion in October, compared with a figure of €2.7 billion in September. All 
three sub-accounts contributed to this contrac-tion, albeit to varying extents. The biggest drop 
was seen in the services sub-account, where the surplus of €0.3 billion in September re
-
versed to a deficit of €1.9 billion in the month 
under review. This was caused, inter alia, by 
the decline in the previous month’s high level 
of income from research and development as 
well as lower receipts from merchanting trade. 
The surplus in cross-border income narrowed 
by €0.4 billion to €5.2 billion. The deficit in cur -
rent transfers, meanwhile, widened slightly, by €0.1 billion, to reach €3.3 billion in October.
In October, the easing tensions on the financial 
markets encouraged domestic investors to 
make new investments abroad. All in all, cross-border portfolio investment gave rise to 
net capital exports of €6.4 billion, mainly as a 
result of domestic investors buying €11.8 billion 
in securities issued by non-residents. Their de -
mand was particularly strong for foreign shares (€4.6 billion) and mutual fund shares (€3.4 bil-lion) – financial products that domestic invest-ors had mostly shunned in the previous month 
(combined total of €1.2 billion in September).

curities to their portfolios. Foreign portfolio in-
vestors purchased securities to the tune of €5.4 
billion on the domestic markets where they 
mainly opted for domestic debt securities (€4.9 billion), with a preference for bonds and notes 
(€3.5 billion) over money market instruments 
(€1.4 billion).
Direct investment, like portfolio investment, 
generated net capital outflows (€3.0 billion) 
primarily due to new investment by German 
enterprises abroad (€7.4 billion). These firms mostly provided more equity capital for their foreign affiliates (€4.5 billion), whose capital 
base was additionally strengthened by re
-
invested earnings (€2.6 billion). Foreign parent 
companies likewise provided funds for their 
German affiliates (€4.5 billion), largely via intra-
group credit transactions (€4.4 billion) which 
comprised trade and financial credits in roughly 
equal measure.
By contrast, other statistically recorded invest -
ment, comprising financial and trade credits 
(where these are not allocated to direct invest-ment) as well as bank deposits and other 
assets, saw net capital imports of €7.9 billion in 
October. Non-banks, however, recorded net 
outflows of €1.1 billion, largely on account of 
capital exports in the amount of €9.6 billion by 
general government. The provision of capital 
for the newly created ESM played a key role in this respect. By contrast, the activities of enter -
prises and households resulted in capital im -
ports totalling €8.5 billion, mostly owing to re-
ductions in their bank deposits abroad. The German banking system experienced inflows 
amounting to €9.0 billion, €4.8 billion of which was attributable to transactions by credit insti-
tutions. A further €4.1 billion was accounted for by the Bundesbank, chiefly as a result of 
higher deposits, particularly by international or -
ganisations, with the Bundesbank (€28.0 bil -
lion) which outweighed the increase in claims 
within the TARGET2 large-value payment sys -

Outlook for the German economy –  
macroeconomic projections  for 2013 and 2014
The cyclical outlook for the German economy has dimmed. There are even indications that eco-
nomic activity may fall in the final quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013. The main factors in this are the adjustment recessions in the euro area, which are severe in some countries, and the slowing of the global economy. However, there are sound reasons to believe that the phase 
of weak economic momentum will not last very long and that Germany will soon return to a 
growth path. This presupposes that the global economy will pick up, that continued progress will be made under the reform process in the euro area and that no new major negative shocks will 
occur. But in view of the difficult economic situation in parts of the euro area and widespread 
uncertainty, economic growth is likely to be slower than previously expected. Nonetheless, the 
sound underlying health of the German economy suggests that it will overcome the temporary lull without major damage to the labour market, in particular.
Following a 0.7% expansion in real gross domestic product (GDP) in the current year, or 0.9% 
after adjustment for calendar effects, economic growth could decline to 0.4% on an annual aver-age in 2013 (0.5% after adjustment for calendar effects), before strengthening to 1.9% in 2014. Subject to these prerequisites and assuming a slight downward path for crude oil prices, inflation in Germany should remain at a moderate level. An inflation rate (measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices) of 2.1% in 2012 could be followed by rates of 1.5% in 2013 and 1.6% in 2014. Excluding energy prices, the inflation rate would rise from 1.6% in 2012 to 1.8% in 2014 because of higher wage agreements. The general government budget looks set to be more or less balanced in the current year for the first time since the onset of the economic and financial crisis in 2008. It is likely, however, to show a marked deficit again next year in the wake of the eco-
nomic slowdown. In cyclically adjusted terms the deficit ratio in 2013 and 2014 will probably 
remain more or less constant at around ½%.
The current projection is characterised by a high degree of uncertainty. It is quite conceivable that 
the euro area will recover sooner and the world economy will accelerate faster than assumed in this projection. In this case, the German economy, in view of its sound underlying health, may be expected to utilise the additional growth opportunities that arise. Downside risks nonetheless pre-dominate. Should global economic growth remain below expectations or the debt crisis escalate further in some countries, it is probable that the German economy may follow a weaker course than the one assumed in the baseline scenario.Deutsche Bundesbank

Current situation
The expansion of real gross domestic product 
(GDP) in the second and third quarters of 2012, 
at a cumulative 0.5%, did not fully meet the 
expectations of the projection published in June.
1 This means that, since the sovereign 
debt crisis in the euro area worsened in the 
summer of 2011, economic growth in Germany 
has on average remained slightly below its esti-
mated potential rate of 1¼%, despite exports 
continuing to rise markedly.2 While goods ship-
ments to euro-area partner countries stag -
nated, deliveries to countries outside the euro 
area rose by just under 5% in price-adjusted 
terms. Exports to the United States and to south and east Asian emerging economies 
were once again particularly dynamic. Without the strong market position enjoyed by German 
enterprises in these countries, German eco -
nomic growth would thus probably have been still weaker.Regardless of buoyant overall export activity, enterprises have reduced their investment 
budgets considerably, shrinking them by almost 5% in real terms over the course of the second and third quarters. This doubtless owes some-
thing to the accumulation of negative news 
from the euro area for a time and to the spill-
over of increased uncertainty into business in -
vestment decisions. As global growth likewise 
showed signs of slackening, a number of in -
vestment projects were postponed or cancelled altogether, despite the extremely favourable fi-nancing terms.
Enterprises’ recruitment plans were also marked 
by a greater degree of restraint. Employment 
growth weakened distinctly in the second and 
third quarters of 2012, and the demand for 
staff, measured by the number of new vacan -
cies, declined considerably. Indeed, seasonally 
adjusted unemployment has even been going 
back up slightly since April.In notable contrast to business investment, ex-
penditure on housing construction rose consid-
erably, although renovation projects were 
probably held back in anticipation of additional 
tax incentives. The construction of new build -
ings remained overwhelmingly focused on blocks of apartments. This accords with price 
trends on the property markets, which show a significant rise for flats in urban centres in par -
ticular. Demand in this segment is being bol -
stered by low interest rates in combination 
with the current climate of uncertainty.Waning dynam-

e1 See Deutsche Bundesbank, Outlook for the German 
economy – macroeconomic projections for 2012 and 2013, Monthly Report, June 2012, pp 15-26.2 It should be noted that the national accounts, unlike the 
foreign trade statistics, include non-cross-border transac -
tions between residents and non-residents in exports and 
imports. This applies in particular to electricity and gas transactions (with the point of delivery in Germany or 
abroad involving no crossing of borders), which in the bal-
ance of payments are booked as supplementary trade 
items. The volume of such transactions has expanded con-
siderably of late. However, the finding that exports have 
continued to rise markedly is also supported by the foreign trade statistics.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report 
December 2012 14

On the other hand, private consumption, 
owing to weak growth, has fallen short of the 
expectations in the current year. Besides the 
ongoing problem of imprecise statistical re -
cording of such spending, it should also be 
noted that disposable incomes have grown less 
strongly than was anticipated in the spring. 
Government consumption, too, is likely to have expanded more weakly in real terms than pre-viously assumed.
Collectively agreed wages should rise by 2.6% 
in the current year, as anticipated in the June projection. This represents a distinct acceler
-
ation over 2011, when they went up by 1.7%, and reflects the healthy overall situation of the 
economy and the labour market. The wage drift could turn out to be largely neutral, as fewer but in some cases larger bonuses have been paid than in 2011. The rise in consumer 
prices in 2012, at 2.1%, will probably be in line with the June projection. In addition to energy, it is mainly food that is driving the price rises. In services and rental housing, the rate of inflation has remained very muted.
Despite the negative influence of the adjust -
ment recessions in the euro area, some of them severe, and the uncertainties resulting from the 
debt crisis, the German economy remains in 
good health. According to the autumn survey 
of the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry (DIHK), almost nine 
out of ten enterprises rate their business situ -
ation as good or satisfactory. Neither house -
holds nor businesses have amassed debts to an 
extent which might cause concern, and the government budget is almost balanced. Ger
-
man firms have a presence in all major markets, 
and their cost/income ratios are satisfactory. 
The unemployment rate, at 6.9%, remains very 
much lower than in the previous decade, and 
employees, with a distinct increase in their dis-
posable income, are participating in the busi -
ness success. This would suggest that the Ger -
man economy is well placed to see through the looming economic lull.Major assumptions
This projection is based on assumptions made 
by the Eurosystem’s experts concerning global 
trade, exchange rates, commodity prices and 
interest rates. The assumptions are based on in-
formation available up to 16 November 2012. 
The assumptions regarding sales markets in the 
euro area are derived from projections for the 
other euro-area countries which are drawn up by the relevant national central banks.
Growth in the world economy has weakened 
further in the current year. This is probably the 
result of global and, particularly, country-specific factors. First, the aftermath of the 
sharp rise in crude oil prices in 2011 is still being felt. The unresolved problems in public finances 
in a number of major industrial countries, as 
well as geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East 
and the Far East, have heightened uncertainty 
and dampened investment. The catch-up pro -Consumption

cess in the emerging market economies ap -
pears to have slowed somewhat, at least for 
the time being, and also seems to be turning 
inward to an increased extent. However, given 
that some of the negative factors are of a tem-
porary nature, global growth should slowly strengthen again. Leading indicators, such as 
the results of business surveys, also suggest this is the case. Nonetheless, the rate of expansion 
in the global economy, at 3¼% in 2013 and 
4% in 2014, is likely to remain below the rates 
prevailing before the financial and economic 
crisis began.
The economic evolution of the euro area con-
tinues to be shaped by the adjustment pro -
cesses which are necessary in some countries. 
The contraction in economic activity threatens 
to be more severe and to last longer than pre-
viously anticipated. Furthermore, a crisis of 
confidence and financing problems in some countries are depressing business investment. 
Nonetheless, there are some clear signs of pro-
gress in the adjustment programmes of states 
particularly affected by the debt crisis. Current 
account deficits have shrunk markedly, and not 
simply because domestic demand in the crisis 
countries has been significantly constrained.3 
Adjustment in cost structures is also progress -
ing, and there are increasing indications that 
enterprises in these countries are tapping new 
export markets. It therefore appears probable that the economic situation in the euro area will stabilise over the course of the coming 
year, and that a nascent recovery will follow, if only hesitantly at first. The precondition for this is that the sovereign debt and banking crises in the euro area do not further intensify and that consolidation and reform efforts continue.
World trade is currently being dampened by the global economic slowdown and a low trade intensity of growth. This is likely to be closely connected to the global weak cyclical momentum of industrial activity. World trade 
will probably expand in 2012 by no more than 
3%. Over the projection horizon, the trade in-
tensity of growth is expected to recover, though without returning to the very high level 
which prevailed before the financial and eco -
nomic crisis. Thus, the volume of world trade 
may rise markedly, at rates of 4% in 2013 and 
7% in 2014. The expansion of German export-
ers’ sales markets will continue to be con -
strained by weak growth in the euro area. After expanding by 1% this year, market growth may 
strengthen to 2¼% next year and 5½% in 
2014, although this would still be far less than anticipated in the June projection.
The euro depreciated significantly during the summer months but later recouped most of 
these losses. The single currency was trading at 
US$1.28 in the period relevant to the deriv -
ation of the exchange rate assumptions, which 
constitutes a depreciation of no more than 
1½% as against the June projection. Compared 
with other currencies that are relevant to for -
eign trade, the euro was 1¾% lower than the assumptions of the June projection.
After the situation on the crude oil markets had 
eased, for a time distinctly, oil prices began to pick up again. Forward prices continue to point downwards, as they have done for some time now. The assumptions of US$111¾ for a barrel 
of Brent in the current year, US$105 in 2013 
and US$100½ in 2014 are around 2½% lower than the assumptions made in the June projec-
tion. This equates to a decline of ¾% in euro 
terms.
By contrast, the increase in the prices of food, 
beverages and tobacco as well as agricultural 
commodities in the past few months was 
higher than projected in June. The price trend 
looks set to remain unfavourable in the near 
future, too. In the case of other commodities, 
however, the weaker economic activity is mak-ing itself felt. Overall, the prices of other com-
modities are likely to follow this year’s steep 
falls by declining a little more next year. Only in Euro area still

2014 can prices be expected to rise again mark-
edly on an annual average.
Weak economic activity in the euro area and the disruptions caused by the sovereign debt crisis prompted the Governing Council of the 
ECB in July to cut its key interest rates to a new historical low. As a result, expectations for the 
future path of short-term interest rates were 
lowered as well. The three-month interest rate derived from market data for unsecured trans-
actions on the interbank market is 0.6% on average for the current year, 0.2% for 2013 
and 0.3% for 2014. This is 20 basis points (for 
the current year) and no less than 50 basis 
points (for next year) lower than the assump -
tions made in the June projection. Owing to 
the strong demand for secure and liquid paper, the yield on German government bonds with a 
residual maturity of nine to ten years was 
pushed down further still. It had already fallen significantly below the assumptions of the June 
projection in the third quarter. Although the yield curve implies that interest rates will re
-
sume an upward path starting in the final quar -
ter of 2012, the yields of 1.5% on average this year, 1.6% for next year and 1.9% for 2014 fall short of the assumptions of the June projection 
by 30 and 50 basis points for the years 2012 
and 2013 respectively.
Lending rates of German banks also eased fur -
ther in the past months. Although a slight rise 
in bank interest rates over the projection hori -
zon can be derived from the projected yield 
path for long-term government bonds, lending 
rates for business loans and consumer credit 
nonetheless look set to remain at very low levels in historical terms. Credit standards for 
loans to enterprises were tightened slightly in 
the third quarter, and the results of the Bank 
Lending Survey indicate that banks will tighten 
them further in the fourth quarter. The Ifo Credit Constraint Indicator, too, has risen 
slightly in the past months. However, the per -
centage of enterprises reporting that banks 
were restrictive in their lending is still very low, and the Credit Constraint Indicator is not far off its historical low. Overall, therefore, financing 
conditions can continue to be regarded as ex-ceptionally favourable and can be expected to 
remain highly supportive of economic activity 
over the projection horizon as well.
In the field of public finances, the projections 
take into consideration all measures which had 
either been adopted when the projection was 
finalised or which had already been specified in detail and are likely to be approved.
4 The meas-
ures considered here will place a limited but 
perceptible strain on the government budget in 
2013 and 2014. The most substantial measure 
in terms of its impact is the lowering of the 
statutory pension contribution rate from 19.6% 
to 18.9% next year. Tax revenue is also set to 
drop slightly on balance owing to the assumed raising of the basic income tax allowance up to the minimum subsistence level. On the expend-
iture side, the measures tending to ease and Marked further

4 The recent decisions on the assistance programme for

curtail cold progression, tax incentives for the restoration 
of buildings, and the granting of pension top-ups for low

agreement with Switzerland and the regular dividend pay-

strain the budget will virtually balance each 
other out in 2013 and 2014. A capital transfer 
related to the resolution of the regional public 
bank WestLB has inflated expenditure in the current year, whereas no further transfers in support of German financial institutions have been assumed for the period thereafter. And the budgetary impact of the abolition of the 
homebuyer’s grant for new homebuyers back 
in 2006 is continuing to decrease. By contrast, 
the latest government initiatives, such as the abolition of the quarterly charge for seeing a doctor or dentist and the introduction of the 
childcare supplement, will increase expenditure permanently.Cyclical outlook5
Business prospects in the corporate sector have 
taken a turn for the worse over the past 
months, not just in the export-oriented sectors 
but also in those focused on the domestic economy. Firms’ lowered expectations have 
been matched by a distinct drop in the volume 
of new industrial orders. The global economy 
has not provided any major impetus for some 
time now, demand from the euro area is dimin-
ishing considerably, and domestic orders are 
being squeezed by the fall-off in investment, in 
particular. Against this backdrop, a decline in 
aggregate output is therefore to be expected 
for the final quarter of 2012. Recently, how -
ever, expectations in the corporate sector have 
stabilised at a low level and even picked up 
again in some cases. Although this will prob -
ably not yet translate into an upturn in eco -
nomic output in the first quarter of 2013, it might be possible to avoid a further decline. This assessment is based on the assumption 
that the winter will not be exceptionally harsh.
Assuming that the global economy overcomes 
the dip in growth and there are no major nega-tive shocks in the euro area, confidence should 
gradually be restored and demand from the 
euro area should at least not drop any further. 
Under these conditions, growth in Germany ought to pick up pace again. An increase in 
output of 0.7% over the course of 2012 could 
be followed by fourth-quarter annual rates of 
change of 1.1% in 2013 and 2.1% in 2014. This 
would equate to average annual GDP growth 
rates of 0.7% in the current year (working-day-adjusted: 0.9%), no more than 0.4% next year on account of the weak fourth quarter of 2012 and first quarter of 2013 (working-day-adjusted: 
0.5%), and 1.9% in 2014. Compared with the 
June projection, the growth expectations for both the short and medium term have thus 
been clearly reduced.Weak Q4 and

Monthly Report 
December 2012 18

Economic growth over the entire projection 
horizon could be roughly as strong as the in -
crease in potential output over the same 
period, namely 1¼% per year. The rate of util-isation of production capacities would thus re-
main more or less normal. The expansion in 
potential output is based, not least, on the in-
flux of labour from abroad. Growth rates are slightly lower than the estimate contained in the June projection owing to weaker invest
-
ment.
The expected upturn in economic activity will be fuelled by higher demand for German in
-
dustrial goods from non-euro-area countries. A 
marked rise in demand from euro-area coun -
tries is only expected to materialise over the 
medium-term horizon. In particular, an upturn 
in investment should benefit the German econ-
omy. The anticipated dip in exports in the 
fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013 could limit export growth to 2% next year 
as against an increase of 4% in the current year. However, exports should rise by 6% in 
2014, driven not only by expanding sales mar -
kets but also by the likelihood that the price competitiveness of German enterprises will 
probably not deteriorate significantly. The share 
of exports to non-euro-area countries should 
continue to increase over the entire projection horizon.
Key assumptions behind this baseline scenario 
are that the debt crisis in the euro area does 
not escalate further, that the reform efforts are 
continued and that the adjustment recessions 
in the euro area come to an end soon. Under 
these conditions, confidence can be expected 
to gradually return. The exceptionally favour -
able financing conditions would then enable 
businesses to lift their investment levels. Hous-
ing investment would probably continue to 
benefit for a time from the heightened uncer -
tainty, fuelling a further discernible increase in 
construction activity in 2013.6 After that, the 
low interest rates would continue to have an expansionary effect, while the uncertainty ef

fect that has been driving demand should be -come less pronounced. Under these conditions, housing construction in 2014 would grow only 
moderately from an elevated level. After con -
tracting distinctly this year and stagnating next year, total fixed capital formation might expand sharply in 2014. Investment in inventories, too, 
is likely to make a marked contribution to 
growth in 2014.
Private consumption should pick up in the next 
two years after recording rather moderate 
growth of ¾% this year. While net wages and 
salaries in 2013 and 2014 will probably not rise as sharply as they have in 2012 on account of a 
slackening labour market, monetary social 
benefits look set to grow at a much faster rate 
owing chiefly to higher pension adjustments. 
As a result, the increase in households’ spend-
ing power, measured in terms of their dispos -
able income, is set to rise to 2½% and 3% in 
2013 and 2014 respectively, thereby clearly out-pacing this year’s rise of 2%. Assuming that the 
saving ratio remains largely unchanged at 
10¼% and price inflation eases, private con -
sumption would rise in 2013 and 2014 by 1% 
and 1¼% respectively in real terms.Largely normal

The import volume has probably risen this year 
by no more than 2¼%, which is well below the growth in exports. This unexpected weakening of the import momentum is chiefly attributable 
to curtailed investment. Imports account for 
around half of domestic investment in machin-
ery and equipment. Inventory destocking was 
probably an additional factor. The expected rise 
in domestic investment and exports should, in 
turn, boost imports. Added to this, the trend towards greater import intensity looks set to 
continue, particularly in the case of exports and of machinery and equipment. In contrast to its falling share of German exports, the euro area 
should maintain its relative share of German imports. The lack of domestic sales prospects is likely to motivate enterprises in the other euro-
area countries to step up their export drive. 
Also, the unused capacities in these countries 
offer procurement possibilities for German en-terprises. This is likely to be bolstered by an im-
provement in the euro-area states’ price com -
petitiveness. The calculated contribution of net exports to GDP growth, which will be very high 
in 2012 on account of the fall-off in domestic 
investment and inventory destocking, should 
turn negative in 2013 due to the relatively weak 
export dynamics and stabilising investment, and could prove neutral in 2014. The current 
account surplus, having risen to 6½% of GDP 
in 2012, would then narrow to 5¾% in the fol-lowing years.
Labour market
The looming economic slowdown is not ex -
pected to lead to a considerable increase in un-
employment. For one thing, the factors which 
led firms to maintain employment levels during 
the 2008-09 financial and economic crisis are 
largely still in place. Maintaining a force of 
highly skilled and motivated workers continues 
to be of major significance. For another, the collectively agreed mechanisms for reducing 
working hours can be activated by firms if ne-cessary. Forgoing overtime, running down flexi-time account balances, reducing regular work-
ing hours and, if need be, also resorting to 
short-time working will probably cushion much of the economic slowdown. This projection as-
sumes that average working hours will be re -
duced by ¾% in 2013 but will then go back up by ¼% in 2014.
The increase in employment is likewise not ex-
pected to continue at the robust pace seen in 
the past few years in isolation from the macro-
economic setting. Some of the exceptional fac-tors that had supported the labour market dur -

tional and nursing care facilities, no longer 
apply to the same extent. Cyclical factors will 
therefore probably have an increasing influence on the labour market. Under the assumed eco-
nomic scenario, the number of employed per -
sons, after rising sharply again this year (+1%), 
could stay flat in 2013 and then grow moder -
ately in 2014 (+½%).
Net immigration is likely to have once again 
risen markedly in 2012 to around 350,000 per -
sons. More people have immigrated than last 
year; in addition, fewer people have emigrated from Germany in the light of the difficult eco-
nomic situation in many European countries. Since the economic situation, and particularly 
the labour market situation, in the crisis coun-tries is unlikely to drastically improve in the near term, continuing high levels of net immigration 
may be expected. In addition, in 2014 com -
plete freedom of movement within the EU will be extended to cover Bulgarian and Romanian 
citizens as well. This projection therefore as -
sumes a net influx of around 250,000 persons 
in both 2013 and 2014. Since migratory flows 
are usually oriented to the labour market, they are likely to offset partial shortages in the Ger -
man labour market and thus stimulate poten -
tial growth.
Against this background, unemployment could 
initially continue to rise slightly, though the in-
crease is likely to mainly affect the first tier of 
unemployment benefits. The average un -
employment rate for 2013 could run to 7.2%. 
That would be 0.4 percentage point above the cyclical low of 2012. As the economy improves, 
the unemployment rate should then drop 
to 7.0% in 2014. The standardised unemploy -
ment rate calculated according to the ILO con-
ventions would first rise to 5.8% before then 
dropping back to 5.6%.
Labour costs and prices
The gloomier business outlook will probably 
have a tempering effect on the coming year’s pay bargaining round. However, there will not 
be a return to the very low wage agreements 
of the past decade, given the considerably im-proved labour market situation. This projection 
presumes that negotiated wages will grow in 
the coming year by 2.7%, a rate similar to the current year. Only in 2014 might wage growth, 
at 3.0%, turn out to be more substantial. The 
wage drift on a monthly basis could well re -
verse and turn negative in 2013 owing to fall -
ing bonus payments and working hour reduc -
tions, which will involve losses in wages. A slightly negative wage drift could be in store 
for 2014 as well. Since social contributions will 
be lowered on balance in 2013, the rise in 
wage costs, measured as compensation per 
employee, will be limited to 2¼%. In 2014, it 
could then accelerate markedly to 2¾%.

economic growth alongside still strongly ex -
panding employment, productivity is declining

back up somewhat in 2013 as employment is 
likely to follow a flat path; in 2014, as eco -
nomic activity picks up, productivity will partly 
make good the losses of the two preceding 
years compared to the trend. Unit labour costs 
are therefore likely to rise by 2½% this year. In 
the next two years their rate of growth will 
then subside to 1¾% followed by 1¼%.
Profit margins will once again contract mark -
edly in 2012 and possibly tighten even further 
in 2013. For 2014, a recovery is expected, how-
ever. The GDP deflator could therefore rise 
both this year and next year by 1½%. In 2014, 
with the economy improving, the increase in 
the prices of domestically produced goods and services would accelerate to 1¾%.
Whereas domestic inflation will probably slowly 
accelerate, the external component will prob -
ably ease under the impact of the assumed 
slightly declining path of crude oil prices. En -
ergy prices will rise considerably, however, owing to the one-off strain imposed by the 
change of course in energy policy. Electricity 
prices are expected to shoot up by around one-tenth at the beginning of 2013, which will add 
0.3 percentage point to consumer price infla -
tion. The development of food, beverage and 
tobacco prices is likewise expected to remain 
unfavourable. Alongside rising price trends on 
the international markets, the further stages of 
the tobacco tax increase, scheduled for 1 Janu-
ary 2013 and the same date in 2014 as well, 
will tend to push up prices. Although a certain 
relief from external price pressures may be ex-
pected for other goods, increased pressure is 
likely to ensue from distribution costs owing to bigger pay increases in the retail trade. The re-markably low rates of price increase for services 
are initially expected to continue. This will re -
flect the impact of abolishing the surgery visit 
charge as of 1 January 2013, which per se will 
reduce inflation by 0.2 percentage point. The 
price trend for air travel and package holidays 
will also be more favourable than in 2012. On the other hand, inflation will probably acceler -
ate in the case of domestic market-related ser -
vices and housing rents. Overall HICP inflation 
could fall from 2.1% in 2012 to 1.5% in 2013 
before then going back up slightly to 1.6%. Ex-
cluding energy, a 1.6% rate of inflation in the 
current year could be followed by 1.4% next 
year and 1.8% in 2014.
Public finances
The general government budget is expected to 
be close to balance in 2012 (2011: deficit of 
0.8% of GDP) for the first time since the finan-cial and economic crisis began in 2008. A chief 
reason for this is that, on an annual average, 
the economic slowdown has barely impacted 
on public finances, since two key variables 
–  unemployment and employee compensa -
tion – have been affected only slightly by the 
slowdown so far. On balance, the markedly 
positive cyclical influence will not change in the 
current year, thus reducing the general govern-
ment deficit level by an amount roughly similar GDP deflator

to 2011.7 One reason for the decline in the cyc-
lically adjusted deficit is that revenue from 
profit-related taxes is rising much faster than is 
arithmetically implied by the current cyclical de-velopment (legislative changes are of lesser im-
portance in this context). For another thing, 
low interest rates, moderate pension increases 
on the whole, further falling labour market 
spending and the expiry of the 2009 economic 
stimulus programme are curbing expenditure growth, thus offsetting burdens elsewhere, 
particularly the transfers in connection with the resolution of the public regional bank WestLB.
The crisis-related developments since 2008 are 
continuing to make a distinct mark on govern-ment debt, however. The debt ratio is likely to 
once again rise perceptibly from its already high level of 80.5% in 2011 to somewhere 
around the 82% mark. This is due to the meas-ures to contain the euro-area debt crisis and in 
connection with the liquidation of WestLB, 
though uncertainty about the exact effects on the public debt remains high. While gross debt 
in connection with financial market support 
measures in Germany and the euro-area assis-
tance mechanisms is largely backed by claims, 
they are subject to marked risk.
In the wake of the economic slowdown that is 
currently expected, a general government def-icit is likely to reappear already in 2013. It might reach around ¾% of GDP and is mainly related 
to the disappearance of the positive cyclical 
component that has prevailed in 2012. By con-
trast, no significant change in the structural 
deficit is evident from a current viewpoint. On 
the one hand, the pension contribution rate 
will be lowered significantly owing to the con-
siderable overshooting of the upper reserve 
limit at the end of 2012 and the moderate fiscal easing is being continued through new budget-ary burdens that are not counterfinanced, such as the abolition of the surgery visit charge. On the other hand, interest expenditure is likely to 
fall, and no new capital transfers to prop up 
German financial institutions are currently 
planned. No major improvement in the struc -tural deficit is in the offing for 2014 either. 
However, in the wake of accelerating economic growth, the deficit could go back down some-
what. Interest expenditure is likely to continue 
to decline, whereas fiscal measures will once 
again put a slight burden on public budgets.
In the coming two years, public budget devel-
opments will diverge. The currently high sur -
pluses of the social security funds are likely to 
be depleted. One reason for this is the end of 
the positive cyclical impact. Another is the in -
cremental reduction of the high statutory pen-
sion insurance fund reserves as the contribu -
tion rate will be reduced markedly at the begin-
ning of next year, and expenditure is expected to grow faster. Signs point to renewed deficits 
in the statutory health insurance scheme, too. 
By contrast, the structural fiscal positions of 
central, state and local government are likely to 
improve, not least in the light of the require -
ments imposed by the national debt brakes. 
The reduction in central government grants to 
the social security funds will also cause a shift 
in burdens within general government.
Despite the temporary economic lull, there are 
signs that the debt ratio will fall in the coming 
two years, since the state “bad banks” are to 
reduce their liabilities (and risk assets) and the 
budget deficits are likely to be relatively small. 
However, this is predicated on the assumption that there will be no additional support meas-
ures for German financial institutions or the 
euro area. All in all, public budgets and – as the 
past few years have shown – particularly the 
debt ratio are subject to considerable risks.

ing to the DIHK autumn survey, firms see the 
economic policy framework as one of the big-
gest risks to their activity. This could indicate 
that uncertainty will not diminish quickly and 
that it may affect the behaviour of enterprises 
and households more substantively than as -
sumed in this projection. In that case, although 
the real estate market boom could further in -
tensify, the effect of this uncertainty on corpor -
ate investment, which is more important for 
medium-term potential growth, could be even stronger. There is no denying the possibility, ei-ther, that the painful adjustment processes in 
individual euro-area countries could last longer, 
with apathy spreading and the will to reform 
dissipating. In order to combat these dangers, 
it would certainly be helpful if further confi -
dence-boosting decisions were to be taken 
soon. This applies to the euro area as a whole as well as to its individual member states. In the 
light of its high degree of openness and spe -
cialisation, Germany cannot prosper on its 
own; it has a particular interest in the prosper -
ity of its partners.
However, a scenario in which good news pre -
vails and confidence is regained more quickly than assumed in the baseline scenario is also 
quite conceivable. There are good grounds for 
believing that German enterprises would then 
use their good market position to capitalise on 
the resulting opportunities and that domestic 
investment would then pick up more strongly.
This projection is based on the assumption that 
the energy-intensive growth of the emerging 
market economies in the past will rebound 
strongly. This expectation stands somewhat in 
contrast to the slightly declining path of crude 
oil prices derived from forward prices. An in -
crease in oil prices would have a direct impact on consumer prices and also cause production costs to rise. A depreciation of the euro, which could occur if doubts about the euro area’s fu-ture viability increase, would have a similar ef-fect. By contrast, a relatively lengthy slack eco-nomic period would dampen upward pressure on wages and prices.Risks to price

German enterprises’ profitability  
and financing in 2011
For German enterprises, 2011 was calmer than the period of turbulence which preceded it. Sales 
expanded as substantially as they had in 2010, although a rise in costs meant that profitability did not quite match its level at the beginning of the recovery, when it had shot upwards. Unlike in 2010, the sharply increasing cost of materials was not the only factor to weigh on income. In the reporting year, there was accelerated growth in personnel costs and, for the first time since 
2008, a year-on-year increase in write-downs occurred. In a setting marked by very buoyant 
activity in their sectors, construction firms and car manufacturers as well as their suppliers were able to make up ground in terms of profitability. By contrast, balance sheet provisions for risks in connection with the energy U-turn and losses in energy trading pushed the revenues of the energy supply companies to a decidedly low level.
In 2011, no major shifts were identified between central balance sheet items at the aggregate 
level. Non-financial assets and financial assets expanded at nearly the same pace and, on the 
liabilities side, equity capital growth only marginally outpaced that of debt. Nevertheless, it is 
likely that the threat of insolvency has been diluted further for non-financial enterprises as a 
whole. This was mainly because, above all, construction and trade enterprises as well as firms in the transportation and storage sectors managed to effect a marked improvement to what had been their rather weak capital base.
Given declining economic optimism and a renewed intensification of the euro-area sovereign 
debt crisis, 2011 witnessed a noticeable decline not only in enterprises’ propensity to invest but also in their long-term equity investments. With internal financing options remaining favourable, 
this was coupled with a cutback in injections of external funds. Enterprises are currently faced 
with a number of substantial uncertainties, which is probably prompting them to defer far-reaching decisions – such as major investment projects. Trade and industry on the whole have structurally buoyant profitability and sound balance sheet structures, essential preconditions for a long-term forward-looking corporate policy.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report 
December 2012

Underlying trends
Non-financial enterprises1 were not quite able 
to sustain the high level of profitability of 2010 
in 2011 in spite of the continuously strong 
growth in sales. This was mainly due to the fact 
that intermediate goods became more expen -
sive and personnel expenses rose considerably. 
Unlike at the beginning of the recovery, firms 
required a marked enlargement in staff num -
bers in order to step up their output. In add -
ition, employees were more closely involved in 
corporate success as a result of major increases 
in negotiated wages, in some cases supple -
mented by large bonus payments. In the pre -
ceding year, a number of collective wage 
settlements, which were agreed during the re-
cession with the aim of securing jobs and in -
volved relatively low wage increases, continued to have an effect. With this in mind – following the jump in profits in 2010 – the yield develop-
ments in the reporting period may be inter -
preted as stabilisation at a level commensurate with good economic years.
All major production subsectors once again led 
the rest of the corporate sector in 2011 with 
regard to sales growth. In particular, construc-
tion and some branches of manufacturing, 
such as the automotive industry and its sup -
pliers, were able to convert this development 
into a very good overall result. In the chemical industry, it was not only high commodity prices that weighed on profits; this branch also lagged 
far behind the average of the manufacturing 
sector with regard to sales growth. The profits 
of energy companies even took a massive hit, 
connected in part with the high losses incurred 
in the energy trading business. Added to this were the effects from the energy U-turn. Al
-
though sales in most of the services sectors did not expand more sharply than in 2010, this was 
generally enough to further boost profitability 
as the strains imposed by costs remained rela-tively limited.
Enterprises re-entered noticeably calmer waters 
in 2011 after a turbulent phase marked by ex-ceptionally strong cyclical fluctuations. (Ex -
planatory notes on the differences in the prof-
itability and financing of large enterprises on 
the one hand and small and medium-sized en-terprises on the other in 2009 and 2010 can be 
found on pages 27-31). Moreover, enterprises 
mostly still expected there to be good eco -
nomic times ahead. Shifts in the major balance sheet ratios therefore remained minimal on the whole. For instance, non-financial assets and fi-
nancial assets expanded by the same margin and only comparatively moderate changes in 
the equity to debt ratio were noted. Irrespect-
ive of this development, the normalisation of 
individual items, in which the reduction of 
 crisis-induced safety buffers was still inhibited 
in 2010, made greater headway. For example, 
in 2010, as a result of the surprisingly strong 
pick-up in demand, industrial enterprises sold 
so many goods that they were not able either to raise their stocks of finished goods to a cyc-lically balanced level or to run down the cash at 
bank and in hand balances they had accumu -
lated as a liquidity measure during the crisis 
year. In the meantime, however, both of these asset items have been scaled back discernibly in 
relation to the balance sheet total, approach -
ing the values recorded before the recession in 2009.
In 2011, enterprises were more cautious with 
regard to investing in tangible fixed assets than they had been in the first year of the recovery. By mid-year, the renewed intensification of the 
euro-area sovereign debt crisis caused uncer -
tainty to grow considerably, putting an initial 
damper on previously very optimistic economic 
expectations. This was just as harmful to the 
investment climate as the fact that key export 
markets within the euro area were drifting into 
recession. Given normal capacity utilisation, the Profitability in

How did large enterprises and SMEs weather the fi  nancial 
and economic crisis?
The fi  nancial and economic crisis cut a deep 
score into business performance at German 
non-fi  nancial enterprises in 2009. Sales slipped by around a tenth compared with 2008, whilst income collapsed by more 
than a quarter. However, this was followed by a swift and substantial revival in demand, enabling fi  rms to return rapidly in 2010 to a 
performance approaching or even exceed-
ing their average for 2006-08. In addition, 
the deep recession gave rise to marked pro-
cyclical trends across a number of balance 
sheet items, such as inventories, cash re-sources and short-term receivables and li-abilities. Overall, equity capital formation 
slowed considerably in the crisis period. As 
an addition to the information provided in 
previous reporting, which for lack of suffi   -
ciently extensive sampling covered only the 
corporate sector as a whole, the present special study breaks the corporate sector 
down into two size categories. The aim is to point up any differences, based on income 
statement and balance sheet ratios, in the 
way large enterprises on the one hand and 
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) 
on the other responded to the recessionary shock which occurred in the fi  nal quarter of 2008 and the fi  rst quarter of 2009.
1
In 2009 and 2010, sales and income fi  gures 
at large enterprises fl  uctuated to a much greater extent than those at SMEs. For in-
stance, large enterprises, which account for just over three-fi  fths of total sales in the eco-
nomic sectors included in the analysis, re-
corded a drop in profi  ts of more than one-
third in 2009, whilst the corresponding con-
traction at SMEs was one-quarter. This was 
attributable, fi  rst, to the fact that large fi  rms are more heavily focused on exports, which were hit particularly hard by the global col-lapse in demand. Second, most domestically oriented sectors, particularly construction 
and the services sector, have a greater pre-
ponderance of relatively small fi  rms than is 
the case in the manufacturing sector, in wholesale trade or in freight and forward-
ing, and these felt the recession very keenly. Interestingly, the return on sales achieved by 
both large enterprises and SMEs fl  uctuated 
to a very similar extent in 2009-10. This ratio contracted by around 1¼ percentage points in the recession – irrespective of the general level of enterprises’ return on sales, which is 
affected by differences in their legal form2 
amongst other things  – before swiftly re-
turning almost to its previous level in 2010.
The very muted fl  uctuation in personnel ex-
penses overall in comparison with other 
cost items is due not least to considerable 
labour hoarding during the crisis period. 
Aside from the more urgent need for staff-
ing adjustment measures at large enter-
prises in view of the greater drop in their 
sales fi  gures, the reduction in this cost item 
in 2009 is likely to have been the result of 
increased lay-offs and the more extensive use of temporary cost-cutting measures 
such as short-time working and reductions 
in working hours with partial loss of pay. In 
addition, the depletion of overtime bal-ances helped to pare down personnel ex-
penses by the amount of the reduced num-ber of hours – despite pay being geared to

basis of a sales threshold of €50 million.2 The return on sales at SMEs (before taxes on income) 
averaged 5¼% in 2006-10, around 1¼ percentage 
points above the return recorded by large enterprises 
in the same period. However, it needs to be borne in 
mind that a much larger proportion of SMEs operate 
as non-corporations, which means that  recorded profi  t also includes imputed entrepreneurial income. An un-distorted comparison of profi  tability between large en-
terprises and SMEs includes only small and medium-
sized corporations. Pre-tax profi  t at the latter came to just under 3½% of sales over the period in question.Deutsche Bundesbank

standard working hours – because it meant 
that fi  rms were able to reverse correspond-
ing provisions on their books. By contrast, 
personnel expenses at SMEs moved very 
steadily in 2009-10. In the year of the crisis, 
they fell by just over 1% compared with 
2008, but were still about 2½% above the 
average for 2006-08. When the recovery 
came, large enterprises experienced a jump in costs, no doubt the result of the tempor-ary crisis measures being discontinued.In line with sales and income fi  gures, in 
 recessionary 2009 operational cash fl  ow 
contracted much more substantially for large enterprises than for SMEs. However,

cash fl  ow fi  gure was made good in the fi  rst 
year of the ensuing recovery, as it was for 
SMEs, which had experienced a cash fl  ow 
contraction only half as steep.4 Although 
the very large reduction in cash fl  ow also 
narrowed large enterprises’ internal funding options considerably in 2009, the shrinkage 
in external funds was three times as great. 
A key factor in this was the scaling down of 
trade payables – including to enterprises belonging to the same group and associ-
ated enterprises.5 The other side of the coin 4 In calculating the cash fl  ow for 2010, estimated ad-
justments were made for the effect of the German Act

cations to the booking of pension provisions. How-ever, the payment streams were unaffected by the changes in accounting methodology. The effects of

was a reduction in uses of funds owing to a 
cyclically induced drop in trade receivables.6 
Large enterprises also cut back their invest-
ment in tangible fi  xed assets to a greater extent than SMEs. One factor in this was 
that large enterprises clearly attached more 
weight to the danger of liquidity bottle-
necks and, therefore, for precautionary rea-
sons, built up their cash holdings much more amply than SMEs did, adding more 
than a quarter compared with the average 
for 2006-08 (SMEs added just over one-
tenth). In 2010, large enterprises imple-
mented a range of capital investment pro-
jects, assisted by access to substantial in-
ternal funds and by favourable fi  nancing terms on the credit markets. By contrast, 
additions to tangible fi  xed assets at SMEs in 
2010 remained distinctly down on 2009, when such investment was already de-
pressed by the recession.
However, more moderate investment activ-
ity at the start of the recovery does not 
mean that SMEs were employing less cap-
ital than previously: the share of total assets 
accounted for by tangible fi  xed assets re-
mained practically unchanged over 2009 and 2010, making up around one-third in 
line with the average for 2006-08. By con-
trast, tangible fi  xed assets at large enter-
prises comprised only 19½% of total assets in 2010, after an average of 21% in the pre-
ceding upturn. These differing trends can 
be explained by the fact that, both during 
the upturn years of 2007 and 2008 and 
during the 2009 recession, SMEs engaged 
in a higher level of net capital investment 
relative to their stock of tangible fi  xed assets than was the case at large enterprises. This 
enabled SMEs initially to derive better cap-
acity utilisation as the recovery got under 
way, avoiding the need for new investment. 
The sharp rise in depreciation expenses at 
large enterprises in 2008 and 2009 was not caused to any notable extent by an increase in the need for unscheduled write-downs in 
the stock of tangible fi  xed assets, but in-stead was the result of the recognition in 
their accounts of lower valuations for their 
long-term equity investments, put in place 
for precautionary reasons in view of the economic downturn. Such considerations 
hardly impacted on SMEs because of their 
low level of interlinkage.
In the crisis year 2009, total assets at large 
enterprises and SMEs were 4% greater than 
the average for 2006-08. However, in the 
fi  rst year of the recovery, the expansion in 
large enterprises’ balance sheets acceler-ated much more substantially. Their total 
assets and liabilities exceeded the 2006-08 average by almost 13%; at SMEs, the com-parable fi  gure was 7½%. Whilst SMEs suc-
cessfully boosted their equity resources 
even during the recession, large enterprises 
increasingly had to draw on borrowed 
funds for a time. This took the form partly 
of long-term bank loans, whilst more bonds 
are also likely to have been issued either 
 directly or through affi   liated companies. 
The trend towards cutting back fi  nancing via short-term bank loans continued in 2009-10, both at large enterprises and at 
SMEs.
Non-fi  nancial enterprises of all sizes en-joyed substantially greater fi  nancial resili-
ence in 2010 than in the upswing years of 
2006-08. At SMEs, equity made up 22¼% 
of total assets, a rise of 4 percentage points on the 2006-08 period. The ratio of equity to total assets at large enterprises, at 29%, 
was just over 1 percentage point higher in 
2010 than the 2006-08 average.

ance of trade credit for corporate fi  nancing in Ger-

need for business expansion investment fell, 
which meant that gross additions to tangible 
fixed assets exceeded depreciation by a consid-
erably smaller margin than in 2010. Further -
more, enterprises limited the acquisition of 
long-term equity investments to some extent. 
Nevertheless, in 2011, the interlinkages among 
enterprises, which can be modelled as 
long-term equity investments as a percentage 
of the balance sheet total, once again attained the pre-crisis peak value recorded in 2007.
The slowdown in enterprises’ propensity to in-
vest along with the still generous scope for in-ternal financing was a key reason why liabilities 
and provisions rose at a considerably more 
modest pace than at the beginning of the re -
covery. Moreover, increasingly stable growth in 
export sales led to a less pronounced expan -
sion in the volume of trade credit as a result of agreements on new payment terms as well as 
a considerable amount of redemptions. Given 
that capital injections, too, were declining, the overall increase in external financing in 2011 
was only half as strong as in the previous year.
The accumulation of reserves, together with 
the bolstering of funds by owners, was never -
theless large enough to push up equity in rela-tion to the balance sheet total. The strengthen-
ing in balance sheet resilience observed over 
the past few years therefore continued in the 
reporting period. Although the expansion was 
rather modest on average for all non-financial 
enterprises, the threat of insolvency is likely to 
have been further diluted noticeably from a macroeconomic perspective due to the fact that particularly construction and trade firms 
strengthened their capital base.
In actual fact, there were once again fewer cor -
porate insolvencies in 2011. In relation to the 
number of enterprises, the figure was almost back at its very low level of the last pre-crisis 
year. The decline in the insolvency rate in sec -
tors such as manufacturing and “transportation Rise in liabilities

in 2011All in all, both large enterprises and SMEs 
weathered the severe recession of the fi  nal 
quarter of 2008 and the fi  rst quarter of 
2009 successfully enough to ensure that, in 
2010, their sales and income fi  gures were 
not appreciably lower than the average for 
the upturn years of 2006-08. As large en-
terprises suffered a signifi  cantly heavier im-
pact from the temporary collapse in de-
mand, however, they implemented more 
extensive adjustment measures to cut costs 
and safeguard liquidity. The options they 
had available for adjusting staff deployment 
fl  exibly in line with order books is likely to 
have played a key role in enabling the en-
terprises to respond in this way. SMEs with-stood the period of recession without hav-
ing to curtail their aim to strengthen their equity resources. Furthermore, capital in-
vestment activity at SMEs was less affected by the prevailing cyclical factors. SMEs were 
assisted in this by the fact that their cash fl  ow did not shrink as substantially in the 
crisis year 2009, and their scope for draw-
ing on internal funds was thus much less constrained. Meanwhile, large enterprises 
took advantage of the highly favourable in-ternal and external funding options offered 
up by the ensuing recovery to make new 
investments.Deutsche Bundesbank

and storage”, which are particularly sensitive to 
the business cycle, was comparatively marked; however, in the recessionary phase, these sec-
tors had had to endure a noticeable rise in business closures. A visible improvement was 
also achieved in the trade sectors, with motor 
vehicle sales leading the way. In construction, 
insolvencies in 2011 were a lot less common 
than they had been in the preceding years as a 
result of favourable demand in this sector. In business-related services, the insolvency rates 
were down by a smaller margin and pre-crisis 
levels were significantly exceeded again in 
2011.
Sales and income
As in the preceding year, in 2011 non-financial 
enterprises’ sales figures went up by almost 
one-tenth. In terms of costs, however, the situ-
ation for the majority of firms was nowhere 
near as favourable as it had been at the begin-ning of the recovery. Amid a continued strong expansion in the cost of materials, the increase 
in personnel expenses accelerated distinctly in 
the reporting year and, for the first time since 
2008, higher year-on-year depreciation was re-
corded. Hence, the annual result before taxes 
on income grew by only 5% compared with 
2010 following a jump in profits of almost half of the strongly depressed level of the severe re-cession caused by the substantial revival in eco-nomic activity. The gross return on sales fell by 
a moderate ¼ percentage point to 4¼% in 2011, thus remaining at the level of similarly 
good economic years.
With a growth in sales of one-ninth, manufac-
turing was not in the lead among the major 
economic sectors, unlike in 2010; instead, it 
was clearly surpassed by energy and water sup-
ply. The very steep rise in sales of close to one-
fifth was, however, not solely attributable to the traditional business of energy companies, 
which is based on energy production including 
delivery to industrial and retail clients. The hike 
in sales was linked, above all, to the sharp in -crease in domestic enterprises’ activities in the 
international electricity trade. The growing im-portance of this high-selling, but not very prof-
itable, business area is illustrated by the fact that sales, for example, have doubled since 
2006 while gross income – gross revenue less 
the cost of materials – has merely gone up by one-eighth in the same period.
Within the manufacturing sector, the metal and metal processing industry once again re
-
corded the strongest pick-up in sales, growing 
by one-sixth. In second place were the large sectors of capital goods manufacturing, the 
proceeds of each of which rose by one-eighth 
in 2011. Whereas this implied an acceleration 
for the electrical engineering industry and the 
mechanical engineering sector, the automotive industry was no longer able to keep pace with the hike in sales of 2010. It was, however, the 
motor vehicle sector that occupied the peak position within the industry in terms of profit growth. Combined with the income leap of 
2010, this sector managed to catch up with the 
manufacturing sector’s average level of profit -
ability of 5%; in 2009, car manufacturers had 
still recorded overall losses. The electrical en -
gineering industry and the mechanical engin -
eering sector, with a return on sales of 6% and 
6½% respectively, remained clearly above the 
average of all branches of industry in 2011. The best value (+8½%) was once again attained by 
the chemical industry, although its profits de -
clined as a result of high commodity prices.
With regard to sales growth, the third key sec-
tor of the production industry – construction – also reached a top position. In 2011, all subsec-
tors of construction saw high demand owing to the distinct revival in commercial and resi
-
dential construction during the cyclical recov -
ery as well as the fact that public sector con -
struction benefited from the lagged effects of 
the economic stimulus packages from the period spanning the fourth quarter of 2008 
and the first quarter of 2009. The proceeds in 
the reporting period were one-tenth higher 
than in 2010, in which there had already been Sales growth

an increase of 4¼%. The fact that construction 
firms reached a new sales record is just as much a reflection of buoyant sectoral activity in 2011 as the substantial rise in profitability. In the four 
decades since the introduction of financial statements statistics, this sector had never 
managed to generate a 6½% return on sales.
The fact that, amid the substantial cyclical up-
turn, the wholesale sector generated 8½% 
more sales in 2011 than in 2010 is less surpris-
ing than the likewise extensive increase in sales of 7¼% on the part of car dealers. This meant 
a sudden rebound of motor vehicle sales to 
their 2006 level following four weaker years. 
The increase in proceeds, which is likely to have 
been based on very dynamic fleet business as 
well as higher margins from sales of privately 
owned cars, was – together with the compara-
tively modest rise in personnel expenses – an 
important prerequisite for further strengthen -
ing profitability. By comparison, the retail sector witnessed only a moderate gain in sales. Higher buying prices even caused profits to contract in the reporting year. Nevertheless, at 4%, the re-turn on sales among retailers remained the best of all trade sectors.
The less cyclically sensitive services sectors such 
as “information and communication” and 
“business services” recorded stable growth in 
sales at quite a high level in 2011. However, this resulted in a considerable increase in profit and 
a marked improvement in the return on sales 
only in the communications sector. By contrast, 
the profitability of the business services sector 
fell moderately, albeit to a level which was still 
adequate. The “transportation and storage” sector was able to further push up sales and 
income in the reporting period, although prof-
itability remained extremely modest.
Income and expenses  
in  detail
Aside from the proceeds from goods sold and 
services rendered, enterprises’ gross revenue also includes a small item which comprises 
changes in self-manufactured goods and other 
own work capitalised. In 2011, however, gross revenue experienced only a minor shift, as op-
posing trends originating from manufacturing 
and construction largely offset each other. For 
example, industrial firms built up their stocks of 
finished goods, which had a bolstering effect 
on income. By contrast, construction firms cap-
italised fewer unfinished goods and services than in 2010. In this context, the fact that a variety of sizeable public-sector projects, the 
funding of which was based on resources from 
the stimulus packages launched at the turn of 
2008-09, were completed in the reporting year is likely to have played a role. On balance, gross revenue and sales both expanded at the same pace.
Like gross revenue, interest and similar income 
grew by one-tenth in 2011 and thus almost en-
tirely offset the decline in the preceding year. 
Against the backdrop of an extensive increase 
in the stock of interest-bearing assets over the 
past years, however, this mechanically implied 
only a very meagre average return of just under 
2%. Long-term equity investments likewise produced only a modest yield. These invest
-
ments – in line with other operating income and extraordinary income  – made a sub-par 
contribution to improving corporate surpluses.
The cost of materials was up by one-eighth in 
2011. The rise in this expense item thereby ex-ceeded both the growth figure of a year earlier 
and the hike in sales in the reporting period. This can mainly be attributed once again to  surging intermediate goods prices. On the 
 import side, commodity price inflation again 
accelerated markedly (27¼%); meanwhile, semi-finished goods prices continued to rise substantially (15½%), but at least were down by half compared with 2010. Domestically-purchased intermediate goods went up by 
5¼% in 2011, after 4% in the previous year. All 
major economic sectors – excluding the com -
munications sector – suffered as a result of the 
cost of materials and buying prices increasing Motor vehicle

more sharply than the proceeds from goods 
sold and services rendered. For example, at 
5¾%, gross income in the manufacturing sec-tor expanded by only half as much as sales; the growth gap was smaller in construction as well as in the transport sector and the business ser -
vices sector. In the trade sectors, however, the 
increase in gross income fell even further be -
hind the corresponding hike in sales than in the 
industrial sector.
With this in mind, it is not surprising that retail-
ers could allow only very subdued growth in 
personnel expenses. Although the collectively agreed wage increases in 2011 were slightly higher than the corresponding rates in the 
manufacturing sector and the business-related 
services sector, firms in the latter sectors sup -
plemented their employees’ wages with 
one-off payments and bonuses – in some cases substantially. Construction experienced a com-paratively robust expansion in wages in 2011 as a result of the persistently good business condi-
tions throughout the preceding years. On the 
whole, the fact that firms increased staff num-
bers also contributed to the rise in personnel expenses. No major sectoral differences were 
visible, aside from energy and water supply as well as business services providers, where costs were more noticeably lower or higher. Overall, 
personnel expenses were up by 4½% in 2011 
after already having risen by 2¾% a year earl-ier.
A year-on-year increase in depreciation (+2¾%) 
was recorded again in the reporting period for the first time since 2008. This turnaround was not, however, caused by higher depreciation of 
tangible fixed assets but was attributable to 
substantial write-downs of financial assets. This 
category also covers profitability reassessments 
of participating interests in enterprises. Accord-
ing to balance sheet statistics, firms in manu -
facturing, communications, and also energy 
and water supply identified a need for correc -
tion in this area. In the energy and water sup-
ply sector, the effects were also linked to the

ing of eight relatively old nuclear power plants 
led to only a rather moderate occurrence of 
special depreciation among energy companies. 
This affected nuclear fuels, among others. The 
nuclear power plant facilities themselves were 
mostly recorded only as memo items in the bal-ance sheets.
The energy U-turn has driven up, above all, the 
item “Other expenses” in the profit and loss ac-
counts of energy companies. The foreseeable 
additional costs associated with this have made 
it necessary to build up appropriate provisions 
for which the offset entries are recorded as other operating or extraordinary expenses.
2 This category generally also comprises the cost of temporary workers. In 2011, temporary em-ployment no longer increased to the same ex-tent as it had when the recovery began, which 
is consistent with the fact that “Other ex -
penses” – especially in the industrial and trans-
port sectors, in which temporary workers are 
often employed  – went up a great deal less 
than in 2010.

which expanded by about the same rate on 
average over the year, they amounted to 4½%. 
Hence, the implied interest yield was just as 
high as in 2010.
Sources and uses of funds
Enterprises’ sources of funds declined by 
around one-quarter in 2011 compared with the 
previous year. The fall partly represented a re -
turn to normal in contrast to the phase at the 
beginning of the recovery when companies, in 
strongly growing their economic activity, had 
once again made extensive use of trade credit, which had been heavily reduced during the re-
cession. In addition, during the reporting period, companies even redeemed long-term 
liabilities on balance. The rather modest trans-fers of capital from partners and shareholders, 
too, indicate that enterprises gave priority to 
using their existing scope for internal financing. 
A good basis for this purpose was provided both by retained profits (including contribu
-
tions to the capital of non-corporations), al -
though they fell short of the level of 2010 by 
two-fifths, and by the development of non-cash expenses. Hence, enterprises preserved additional funds through greater depreciation 
paired with increases in provisions.Sources of funds

The fact that enterprises no longer had to pro-
cure as much capital externally was also linked to a reduced willingness, compared with 2010, 
to build up new non-financial and financial 
assets. Waning economic optimism from mid-
2011 onwards as well as unresolved problems 
in connection with the euro-area debt crisis are 
the main reasons why the increase in short-
term receivables was substantially smaller than 
in 2010. Cash balances were, in fact, reduced 
in 2011, reflecting enterprises’ efforts to scale 
back the liquidity buffers that had ballooned in 
the course of the severe recession. This oc -
curred with a time lag owing to surprisingly dy-
namic revenue growth in 2010. In connection 
with the robust resurgence of demand when 
recovery began, stocks of finished goods could 
initially not be expanded to levels desired by 
enterprises. Together with the changes in work 
in progress as well as raw materials, consum -
ables and supplies, the accumulation of stocks in 2011 was yet again almost as substantial as in the preceding year.
Somewhat fewer funds were also deployed for 
investment purposes in the reporting period. 
The gross increase in tangible fixed assets ex -
ceeded depreciation of tangible fixed assets by one-tenth, which suggests a further expansion 
in production capacity. However, the rise had still been 15% higher in 2010. This develop
-
ment was attributable, in part, to construction 
and the trade and transport sectors, in which 
the need for additional plant and equipment 
was found to no longer be as high as in 2010. 
It was also attributable to energy and water 
supply companies which – possibly in response 
to uncertainty linked to the energy U-turn  – 
scaled back their ambitions to expand although 
they were still in the lead regarding the tan -
gible fixed asset accumulation factor, ie the 
gross increase in tangible fixed assets over de-preciation of tangible fixed assets.
3 As in 2010, 
this ratio remained moderately above the ex -
pansion limit in the manufacturing sector. 
Meanwhile, a sizeable hike in investment activ-
ity was recorded in the business services sector. 
In 2011, the acquisition of long-term equity in-vestments by non-financial enterprises was 
marginally smaller than the volume of the year 
before. Securities holdings were even reduced 
slightly.
Balance sheet developments
The balance sheet total of the recorded sectors 
rose by 4% in 2011, following an increase of 
just under 7% in 2010. On the assets side, non-financial assets and financial assets ex
-
panded at nearly the same pace whereas, on the liabilities side, equity growth once again outpaced that of debt. However, compared with a year earlier, the growth gap narrowed 
significantly over the reporting period. One fac-tor in this development was that the first-time 
application of the German Act to Modernise 
Accounting Law (Bilanzrechtsmodernisierungs-gesetz) in 2010 had the one-off effect of redu-cing the balance sheet value of provisions.
4 Fur-
thermore, growth in equity capital was less pronounced in 2011. This was essentially also due to the fact that resilience, which may be 
assessed from different angles using a range of balance sheet ratios, was further strengthened 
but actually improved only rather modestly 
compared with the most recent economic up -
swing years.
An important indicator is that equity went up 
only slightly in terms of assets in 2011. On an 
average of all enterprises, the share of equity 
capital in the balance sheet total amounted to around 27%, following 26¾% in 2010. Against 
this backdrop, construction firms and retailers 
were able to make significant strides. Amid un-
remarkable balance sheet growth, in 2011, equity expanded by more than one-tenth in construction and retail, while motor vehicle Reduced 
non-financial and financial assets primarily affected external financing

and wholesale trade performed above average, 
too. The manufacturing sector settled at mid-
table in terms of equity capital growth and 
there was no improvement in the equity ratio. 
With the exception of trade, equity capital 
growth was below average in the services sec-
tors, and likewise in energy and water supply. 
Given ongoing balance sheet consolidation ef-
forts, however, this was sufficient for transpor -
tation and storage companies to once again 
distinctly boost their equity ratio. Whereas no 
change was recorded in the business services sector and the communications sector, the 
equity ratio of energy companies dropped.If equity, long-term liabilities, provisions for 
pensions and the special tax-allowable reserve 
are grouped together under the heading long-term equity and liabilities, there was a 
marked decline in this item as a percentage in 
the balance sheet total in 2011. A key factor 
was that long-term bank loans were redeemed 
on balance, while short-term contracts were 
renegotiated on a large scale. Enterprises’ pref-erence for longer loan maturities – observed in 
the crisis period – could no longer be ascer -
tained in the second year of the cyclical upturn 
owing to the weakening propensity to invest.

pace with balance sheet growth even though 
this item had seen a double-digit rise in 2009 
and 2010. Furthermore, enterprises’ provisions 
for pensions fell in 2011, too.
In balance sheet terms, long-term equity and 
liabilities still “funded” fixed assets by almost 110% despite the subdued growth in the re
-
porting period. The soundness that can be de-
rived from this ratio was built up persistently 
over the past decade. This trend could not be 
continued in 2011 owing to enterprises’ will -
ingness – especially in the case of longer-term financial investments such as the acquisition of long-term receivables, long-term equity invest-
ments and securities  – to forego, in some cases, liability-side hedging of equivalent size and maturity. For this reason, the share of long-term equity investments, including long-term receivables from affiliated com
-
panies, in the balance sheet total increased substantially. However, the expansion in tan
-
gible fixed assets failed to match total asset growth in 2011. In addition, intangible fixed assets were capitalised less frequently than in 
2010.
The cash resources and short-term receivables 
available to meet short-term liabilities in 2011 
did not quite match their levels of the previous 
year. However, when assessing this develop -
ment, it should be borne in mind that the re -
duction in cash at bank and in hand balances 
from the high levels of 2009 and 2010 was, in fact, desired so as to make the holding of cash 
more efficient irrespective of low opportunity costs. Inventories were also built up increas
-
ingly. These inventories – as successfully dem -
onstrated during the 2009 recession – can also be reconverted comparatively quickly to secure liquidity. In terms of debt and redemption pay-ments outstanding, the solvency of enterprises 
was still well ensured. Hence, although the ratio of cash flow to debt fell between 2010 and 2011, it still signals an eased situation in 
the reporting period compared with the longer-
term average.Trends for 2012
Since mid-2011, the upswing in the German 
economy has slowly but, as a whole, notice -
ably lost momentum. Slower global economic 
growth and the severe adjustment recessions in 
some euro-area countries had a visible impact 
on enterprises’ export business. Moreover, en -
terprises gradually lowered their economic ex -
pectations as they found themselves in an en -
vironment characterised by great uncertainty 
– in particular with regard to the euro-area sov-
ereign debt crisis – and therefore did not ex -
pect business to improve in the short term. All … but fixed

of this caused investment to weaken. The con-
solidated financial statements statistics, which 
cover the non-financial groups of enterprises 
listed in the DAX and the MDAX and which are 
currently available up to the third quarter of 
2012, have captured a slight decline in the share of tangible fixed assets in the balance 
sheet total. In addition, the net increase in tan-
gible fixed assets has fallen in absolute terms 
compared with the 2011 figure. There is a gen-eral tendency for larger enterprises in particular to try to consolidate their presence on flourish-
ing export markets by acquiring and founding 
companies abroad. This can be seen in the stat-
istics evaluated here, for instance, in the fact that the tangible fixed asset ratio, which is based on the extrapolated individual financial statements, has been falling significantly for 
quite some time.5
According to preliminary information from the consolidated financial statements statistics, the increase in the capital base was not quite able 
to keep pace with balance sheet growth in 
2012. Besides the substantial write-downs on 
the foreign long-term equity investments of 
some groups of enterprises, this was also at -
tributable to valuation effects in connection with group accounting, which, however, do 
not affect individual enterprises’ financial state-
ments. In that vein, the valuation of pension obligations on the given balance sheet date 
played a key role. The resulting increase in pro-
visions was coupled, in balance sheet terms, with a corresponding decline in equity. A  counter-effect for equity emerged from the 
euro depreciation, which led to higher book values in non-euro-area subsidiaries’ balance 
sheet consolidation.6 With regard to the equity 
ratio of all non-financial enterprises, due ac -
count should be taken of the rising trend of the 
past few years that was sparked primarily by 
small and medium-sized enterprises.
Corporate groups are unlikely to have outper -
formed the high profitability of 2011 in 2012. 
Measured in terms of the selected consolidated 
statements’ nine-month results, the return on 
sales, at 6%, is lower than the annual values 
recorded for 2010 and 2011. Moreover, the re-
sult for the final quarter of 2012, which will 
probably be poor in real terms, is likely to push the annual results down even further. However, 
this has little bearing on the observation that, 
for the third year running, corporate groups 
have achieved a return on sales that is roughly Valuation effects

Calendar effects on economic activity
Calendar configurations can have a marked impact on economic activity. In the case of the quar-
terly rate of change in real gross domestic product (GDP), they account for as much as 1 percent -
age point. In the monthly movements of industrial output, calendar effects are often on a scale of more than 5 percentage points.
With regard to statistical measurement of calendar effects, a distinction should be made between 
two aspects. Following European recommendations, patterns that recur annually and are typical 
of a given month or quarter are assigned to the seasonal component of a time series. In a month with 31 days, more work is performed and more is consumed on average than in a month with 
30 days, let alone a month with 28 days. This should be differentiated from effects that result, 
say, from the shift in the number of working days within the same given month or quarter. In the context of official seasonal adjustment, these are recorded separately as calendar effects.
The forms in which calendar effects appear are manifold and vary depending on the economic 
sector and the type of economic activity which is measured. For a large number of German eco-
nomic indicators, the working-day model has proved to be effective in quantifying calendar 
effects. This model takes account of the fact that a working week of five days is usual in Germany, but that production is sometimes continuous, ie takes place even on public holidays. In the manu-
facturing sector, for example, one additional working day in the months January to November 
thus leads, on average, to a 3.4% higher monthly output. The effect is less pronounced in Decem-ber, since production is cut back anyway in the period around Christmas. The scale of activity in 
other sectors of the economy, such as transport, likewise follows a working-day pattern. Retail 
sales, on the other hand, are influenced more by the number of days on which outlets are open for business. However, these effects are not equally strong in every month. For GDP, the calendar effect is derived by aggregation across all sectors of the economy. A 1% increase in the number of working days leads, on average, to a 0.3% rise in overall output.
Such calendar effects prove to be largely stable across time. The increased use of working time 
accounts and of more flexible working hours has no noticeable impact on this. Furthermore, the estimated relative effects are virtually independent of the cyclical situation.
In principle, the effects on output of “bridge days”, the timing of school holidays or of weather 
conditions can also be estimated by calendar adjustment methods. For example, industrial out -
put on such a bridge day is, on average, about one-third lower than on a normal working day. This effect is not independent of the cyclical situation, however. Difficulties in determining a stable correlation also arise when estimating the effects of school holidays. And, in assessing the effects 
of the weather using calendar models, subsequent catching-up effects are not clearly quantifi -
able. Accordingly, in official statistics, such effects are not assigned to the calendar component, but are shown instead in the collective item “irregular effects” of the relevant seasonally adjusted time series.Deutsche Bundesbank

The importance of calendar 
effects
Calendar configurations have a marked impact 
on economic activity. For example, real GDP in-
creased at an annual rate of 1.7% in the first 
quarter of 2012. However, this growth received a boost from the leap year effect (29 February) 
and from the early Easter business season, 
which began in March. Calendar influences 
probably contributed an estimated 0.5 percent-
age point, so that the calendar-adjusted output 
rose by “only” 1.2%. A counter-movement took place in the second quarter: at 1.0% up 
on the previous year, the calendar-adjusted in-
crease was 0.5 percentage point higher than 
that of the original values. Moreover, since the third quarter of 2012 had one working day less than the corresponding quarter one year previ-ously, the growth rate of the original values in this case, too, is, at 0.4%, below the calendar-adjusted increase of 0.9%. Output in the manu-
facturing sector and construction output de -
pend to a very large extent on the calendar. It is not uncommon for working-day deviations in a given month to amount to 5%, or even more, of the series level.
Calendar patterns not only affect flow variables 
(which are measured over a period of time), 
however, but also stock variables (which are measured at a point in time). The prices of some services, such as package holidays, de
-
pend positively on the timing of movable public 
holidays such as Easter or Whitsun, around which times demand for travel usually in
-
creases. And the volume of overnight deposits held by credit institutions at the end of a month is lower when the day of observation is shortly before the weekend, as this is when many indi-viduals withdraw cash for the weekend ahead.
Moreover, the calendar affects seasonal behav-
iour. In months with 31 days, for instance, 
more work is performed and more is consumed 
than in a February with 28 days, and Christmas 
shoppers push retail sales to seasonal peak 
levels every December. Following European rec-Macroeconomic

ommendations,1 effects that recur annually 
and can be allocated to a particular month or 
quarter are assigned to the seasonal compon -
ent of a time series. Only the other calendar 
influences that result, for example, from the 
shift in the number of working days (and there-fore in the number of weekends or public holi-
days) within the same given month or quarter 
are recorded in the context of official seasonal 
adjustment as calendar effects. These effects 
are examined in greater detail below.
Estimating calendar factors
In order to quantify calendar effects precisely, it 
would actually be necessary to conduct daily 
statistical surveys, as then it would be possible 
to precisely measure production volume on 29 February, for instance, or retail sales on a 
given day before Easter.
But because often only monthly data are avail-
able, the relevant calendar effects cannot be 
calculated directly. Instead, the Easter effect in 
March or April of each year becomes blurred 
with all the other effects in the month in ques-
tion. For this reason, it is only possible to con-
duct estimates based on comparable calendar 
configurations that have occurred sufficiently 
often in the past.
In the case of quarterly data, for instance, the 
Easter effect, which sometimes occurs in the 
first quarter and sometimes in the second, 
overlaps with all the other effects that arise be-tween 1 January and 30 June. As a result, dir -
ect quantification on the basis of quarterly time series leads to greater uncertainties than when 
using comparable monthly data. The quarterly 
approach is therefore generally considered dif-ficult. For the same reason, the calendar adjust-ment of the quarterly national accounts (QNA) 
in Germany is also carried out using monthly 
indicators that are closely related to the corres-
ponding QNA variables. These indicators are 
used to derive monthly calendar factors2 which 
are condensed with variable weights into quar -terly factors and are consolidated in the na -
tional accounts according to the importance of 
the individual series. The most accurate statis -
tical quantification of calendar effects is pos -
sible following this procedure. Moreover, the 
consistent treatment of monthly and quarterly 
indicators of sectoral and macroeconomic out-put is assured; this is very important in analys-ing and forecasting economic activity.
RegARIMA models have prevailed internation -
ally for estimating calendar influences (for de -
tails, see annex with methodological notes on 
pages 59-60). These models can be used to 
 determine semi-elasticities which, for example, 
indicate the average percentage effect of an 
additional working day (compared with the 
month-specific average) on monthly output.
In Germany the working-day model has proved 
to be effective for a large number of economic 
indicators. It is based on a five-day working week and takes into account that, in some 
cases, production is carried out continuously – meaning even on public holidays. Since an add-
itional working day in a month with a fixed 
duration always means a weekend day or pub-lic holiday day less in that month, the estimated 
working-day effect reflects exactly the differ -
ence, for example, between production on a normal working day and production on a 
weekend day. A distinction needs to be made 
between two extreme cases. In an economic 
sector with purely working-day production (ie 
without continuous production), the working-
day effect is proportional. Assuming a month 
to have 20 working days on average, one add-
itional working day would lead to an increase 
in production of 5%. On the other hand, if pro-duction is continuous and consistent across all the days of the week, there is no difference be-Quantification of

tween the level of production on a working 
day and a weekend day. In such a case, there-
fore, no working-day effect is measured. The 
calendar effect is then fully included in the sea-
sonal component.3
In the manufacturing sector an additional 
working day usually leads to 3.4% higher pro-
duction in a month. However, the effect is 
lower in December (2.6%) because many firms cut back production in the time around Christ-mas in any case, irrespective of the number of working days.
4
In calculating the number of working days, 
both national and regional public holidays have 
to be taken into account. The latter are con -
sidered on a pro rata basis according to the share of employees in the federal states af
-
fected in each case. For example, Ascension 
Day, which is not a statutory public holiday in 
all states, counts for Germany as a whole as 
0.3 of a working day. In sectors in which pro -
duction is highly region-specific, only the re -
gional calendar patterns are relevant, of course. 
That is why only the working days in North 
Rhine-Westphalia are used for the adjustment 
of mining and quarrying production. In this case, an additional working day results in an average monthly increase in production of 
2.2%.The working-day effect is lower in the energy 
supply sector, which largely produces on a con-
tinuous basis. An additional working day 
(meaning one weekend day less in a month of 
fixed duration) raises output by only 0.8% on 
average. Thus, the continuous production base 
is relatively high. This is reflected in the esti -
mate of the leap year effect. Regardless of whether 29  February is a working day or a weekend day, continuous production on that day leads to an average increase of 2.8% for the month; the pure working-day effect de
-
scribed above applies in addition if 29 February is a working day.
In the construction sector the working days 
have an almost proportional effect in the warm 
season. Generally speaking, little work is per -
formed at weekends. By contrast, the calendar 
effects on output are less pronounced in the months November to March, when output is 
primarily driven by weather conditions. When it is very cold for a prolonged period of time, and 
ice or snow hinders construction, one add -
itional working day has less of an impact than 
in the rest of the year. For the quarterly sales figures in specialised construction activities, 
such month-specific considerations cannot be 
taken into account when calculating the calen-
dar effects. Converted to a monthly basis, an 
additional working day leads to an increase in 
turnover of 1.9% on average.
Amongst other things, the weighting of both 
indicators for the construction sector in the na-tional accounts (on the supply side, gross value 
added in the construction sector; on the de -
mand side, construction investment) takes into consideration the fact that the results from the first quarter are more strongly affected by spe-
cialised construction activities owing to the Working-day 
 effects in the 
manufacturing sector

weather-related output losses in outside pro -
duction. Moreover, specialised construction ac-
tivities have risen steadily in importance com -
pared with construction over the last few dec-
ades given the growing volume of renovation 
and modernisation work carried out on existing 
buildings.
Whereas monthly production in most sectors is 
mainly affected by the working days from 
Monday to Friday, retail turnover is influenced 
more by the number of days on which outlets 
are open or closed for business. Calendar ef -
fects are not equally strong in each month in 
the retail trade. One Sunday more (and there -
fore one shop opening day less) in the months 
January to November means, on average, a 
3.1% drop in sales. In December, the number of 
shop opening days shows no significant im -
pact, however, because Christmas trade, the 
predominant factor, takes place regardless of 
the number of days on which retail outlets are open for business. An additional shop opening 
day as a result of a leap year, on the other hand, leads to an increase in February retail sales by 4.2%. In the case of retail sales of food, beverages and tobacco products, con
-
sumers do more of their shopping on Thurs -
days and, in particular, on Fridays compared 
with the other weekdays.
Public holidays also affect aggregate retail 
trade turnover. On the one hand, Good Friday 
and Easter Monday reduce turnover in the re -
spective March or April. On the other hand, 
Easter stimulates sales on the days prior to the Easter period. The bulk of Easter purchases are made during the last two weeks before Easter. Depending on when Easter falls, this results in additional sales proceeds in March and/or April.
The first of May (if it does not fall on a Sunday), 
Ascension Day or Whit Monday have a damp-
ening effect on turnover in the months May 
and June by an average of 1.7% in each case. German Unity Day has to be taken into consid-
eration in October. If this national public holi -day does not fall on a Sunday, the result is a 
1.6% drop in retail sales.
In the national accounts, trade includes retail and wholesale trade as well as the sale of 
motor vehicles. For the latter two components, 
only the number of working days in the five-
day week is of significance according to empir -
ical studies. Although many motor vehicle 
traders are open for business on Saturdays as 
well, it is possible that the sales generated on a 
Saturday are not entered into the accounts until the following Monday, so that they are statistically allocated to the respective month under that day. Another factor could be that new vehicles are mainly picked up from the 
dealer on the day they are registered – which 
can only be on a normal working day. With re-gard to the aggregation of the calendar factors 
for gross value added in the trade sector as a 
whole, it may be seen that the importance of 
wholesale trade is greatest, accounting for al -
most 50%. Retail trade follows (over 35%), 
with the sale of motor vehicles accounting for 
around 15%. Only in the fourth quarter is the 
retail trade’s share roughly two percentage 
points higher than usual due to the Christmas 
effect, while the weights of the other segments are correspondingly lower.
Activities in other economic sectors such as transport also follow a working-day pattern (transport production is measured by person 
kilometres and net tonne kilometres recorded 
by the railways, buses and trains as well as by 
net tonne kilometres for trucks). The exports 
and imports recorded in the national accounts are based, respectively, on the indicators of the 
exports and imports of extra trade and intra 
trade in goods as well as revenue and expend-
iture from cross-border trade in services. The quarterly series currently show an average 
working-day elasticity of around 0.4 for exports and around 0.3 for imports.
The calendar factor for real GDP is ultimately 
derived from all these components. Macroeco-nomic working-day elasticity is currently around Retail trade

0.3. This means that one percent more working 
days leads to an average increase in overall 
economic output by 0.3%, whereby the calen-
dar effect is usually somewhat lower in the 
fourth quarter because of the Christmas effect.
The introduction of working time accounts and 
of more flexible working hours has no notice -
able impact on the calendar effects described 
above. As stipulated in the collective wage 
agreements, credit hours are mainly to be ac -
cumulated and used up during the normal 
working week from Monday to Friday. This pro-
vision therefore does not affect the average 
gap between the economic activity on a work-
ing day and a weekend day, which is the only 
factor responsible for the effects within the 
working-day model.
The estimated relative calendar effects (semi-elasticities), too, are virtually independent of 
the cyclical situation. Output per working day is 
greater during boom periods than recessions. 
However, as long as the continuously produced 
goods rise by the same extent, the relative 
working-day effects do not change (compared 
with the weekend day effects). This makes it 
possible to predict them accurately.
Nevertheless, the relative importance of calen-
dar effects does change over time. This can re-sult in aggregates from shifts in the importance 
of economic sectors with strong or weak 
working-day effects. For example, the working-
day elasticity of gross value added in the con -
struction sector is decreasing in the long term 
because specialised construction services, 
which show relatively little calendar impact, are gaining in importance.
Special aspects: bridge days, 
school holidays and weather conditions
In addition to the effects described above and 
taken into account in the official seasonal ad -
justment, there are other calendar effects whose impact is verifiable as an average. How-
ever, quantifying this impact causes problems.
One such example is the bridge day. This term 
refers to a day that falls between a statutory 
public holiday and the weekend. Bridge days are counted as normal working days for pur
-
poses of the working-day model. However, 
employees increasingly take advantage of them 
to use up flexitime credit hours or for a long 
weekend. For this reason, output in the manu-
facturing sector is, on average, around one-
third lower on a bridge day than on a normal 
working day. At the turn of the year, however, 
when many firms reduce production in any 
case, the bridge-day effect is lower. Of course, a series that is additionally adjusted for bridge days is smoother than a series that is only cal-
endar and seasonally adjusted because some variance is assigned to the bridge-day effects 
and filtered out.
Quantification difficulties arise, however, due 
to the fact that the effect of bridge days is not 
proportional to their number. The effect is smaller in months with two bridge days, be
-
cause in many cases only one of the two days is used for a long weekend. Thus, automatically taking the one-bridge-day effect into consider -
ation twice would lead to an over-adjustment. On the other hand, an estimate that took all of 
these special factors into consideration would 
not be statistically secured due to the small 
number of observation values, nor could it be 
carried out on a disaggregated level. Moreover, 
it has to be borne in mind that an additional 
day of holiday taken on a bridge day implies a 
day of holiday less over the rest of the year, 
which means that a counter-entry is necessary 
in order to avoid distortions that affect eco -
nomic analysis in the seasonally and calendar-
adjusted series. However, indirect effects and their temporal distribution cannot be reliably 
ascertained.
In addition, bridge-day effects are not stable 
over time. On the one hand, they have been 
growing in importance for decades; on the Calendar factors

other, the extent to which they are used de -
pends on the economic situation. In phases of 
weak economic activity or crisis, bridge days 
tend to be used more as a means of quickly 
bringing production into line with an unfavour -
able orders situation. Conversely, somewhat 
less use seems to be made of bridge days, on 
average, during boom periods.
Whether and how much work is performed on 
a given day does not depend solely on whether that day is a normal working day, a national or 
regional public holiday or a bridge day, how -
ever. The timing of school holidays is also of relevance. Many employees have school-age children, and so interrupt their work during the 
school holidays. Businesses, too, temporarily 
stop production. Since school holidays do not 
fall at the same time throughout Germany and their timing varies from year to year in the indi-
vidual federal states, the effect is not com -
pletely captured by seasonal adjustment. For this reason, it could be modelled within the 
scope of calendar adjustment in principle, as it 
is also treated in this context by European rec-
ommendations.5
It becomes evident that the strength of the im-
pact caused by a shift of holidays greatly de -
pends on the individual months. The effects of 
the movement of holidays are strongest in July 
and August. There is little or no evidence of such effects in other months. The month-
specific estimate is based on a very small num-
ber of observation values, meaning that the 
result is not stable over time: further individual observations may have a strong impact on the estimated result.
As with the adjustment for bridge days, the 
economic situation here, too, has an impact on 
the size of the effect. In the years 2011 and 
2012, many firms in the car manufacturing in -
dustry refrained from cutting back production 
during the summer holidays to be able to meet the growing demand.
In connection with calendar adjustment, Euro-
pean statistical recommendations
6 also address 
the question of weather effects on construc -
tion output such as those that result from dif-
fering numbers of ice or snow days, as the 
same method can be used to measure all these 
effects. Because weather conditions can vary 
greatly from one region to the next, local wea-
ther data have to be weighted according to their importance in explaining construction

Annex
Methodological notes
From an estimation point of view, calendar effects 
cannot be determined using simple regression analy-
sis models in which, for example, only the number 
of working days explains economic activity. Such an 
approach would be misspecified, as it would not 
take the systematic trend-cyclical and seasonal influ-
ences into account.8 In order to avoid false conclu -
sions, these time series components therefore have to 
be integrated. This is done with the help of RegARIMA 
models by using regular and seasonal differences as well as ARMA parameters. As the abbreviation 
“ RegARIMA” suggests, this model class combines a 
regression model with ARIMA techniques.

 calendar effects using a  RegARIMA modeloutput and aggregated. It would actually be 
necessary to use data that cover the location of 
each building site. But since such data are not 
available, use is made of a breakdown of em -
ployees in the construction sector by company 
domicile as an approximation for weighting 
data from selected meteorological offices.
According to the above method, construction 
output falls considerably as a result of one add-
itional ice day.7 The effects are strongest in Feb-
ruary and March. The series which is addition-
ally adjusted for weather conditions is, of 
course, also smoother than the series which is 
only adjusted for calendar and seasonal effects, 
because the additional variable explains part of 
the variance. Nevertheless, a number of months still show remarkably high residual weather ef-
fects in series that are actually weather-
adjusted. In other months there is more of an 
over-adjustment.
But the list of problems in quantifying the wea-
ther effect does not stop there. The days on 
which ice and snow days fall have a varying 
impact not only between, but also within, indi-
vidual months. For example, work is discon -
tinued at many building sites between Christ -
mas and New Year in any case, so that the weather conditions are only of minor import
-
ance on those days. Moreover, sustained periods of cold and the weather-related pro
-duction backlogs are made up for in subse -
quent periods; statistically, however, these 
catching-up effects cannot be satisfactorily 
quantified. For these reasons, the official sea -
sonal and calendar adjustment does not give 
special consideration to non-seasonal weather 
effects.
Conclusion
Calendar configurations affect economic activ-
ity in many different ways. A varying number of 
working days has a particularly strong impact 
on sectoral and macroeconomic output, and 
the effect is greater the less continuous pro -
duction is. The estimated calendar effects are 
not dependent on the economic situation; nor 
has the introduction of working time accounts 
had any impact. Retail sales are primarily af -
fected by the number of days on which outlets are open for business. Easter plays a particular role in this context. On the other hand, special 
problems arise with respect to the quantifica -
tion of bridge days, school holidays or the 
 effects of weather conditions. Official statistics 
are therefore not adjusted for such effects. 
 Official calendar adjustment filters out only 
those influences that are statistically significant, 
can be explained in economic terms and are

Here, i=1,…,S (with S=12  representing monthly data 
and S=4 representing quarterly data) and j stands for

ference operator of order d and (1–BS)D denotes a

ki is the k-th regressor, which is defined as the 
deviation of the monthly value from the long-term 
month-specific average, which as a part of the sea-
sonal component is not assigned to the calendar 
factors. βk is the corresponding regression coeffi -
cient, which can be interpreted as semi-elasticity. φp, 
ΦP, θq and ΘQ represent polynomials of grade p, P, q 
or Q. ai, j is assumed white noise.
This yields, as the estimated calendar component,
(2) ĉi, j = exp (∑n
k = 1 βk (xki, j – x_
ki)).
To derive quarterly calendar factors from monthly 
time series, the following model for decomposing 
time series is assumed for both the monthly and the corresponding quarterly time series.
(3) 
yt = tt · st · ct · it .
The original values y can be expressed as a product 
of the unobservable components trend cycles ( t), 
season ( s), calendar ( c) and irregular influences ( i). 
The index t beside the original values and the com-
ponents stands for the time. The corresponding sea-
sonally and calendar adjusted series is defined as
(4)  yt
st · ct = tt · it .
As a simple example, it is assumed for flows that the 
quarterly original value ( Y ) results from the sum of 
the relevant monthly values ( y(1), y(2) and y(3)):9(5) Yt = yt(1) + yt(2) + yt(3).
Using (3), it follows that(6) 
Yt  = Tt · St · Ct · It 
=  tt(1) · st(1) · ct(1) · it(1) + tt(2) · st(2) · ct(2) · it(2)  
+ tt(3) · st(3) · ct(3) · it(3).
Thus, the required quarterly calendar factor can be 
represented as
(7)Ct =tt(1)·st(1)·it(1)
 · ct(1) +tt(2)·st(2)·it(2)
 · ct(2)
Tt · St · It Tt · St · It
+tt(3)·st(3)·it(3)
 · ct(3).Tt · St · It
The calendar factor of the quarterly series is there-
fore a weighted arithmetic average of the monthly 
calendar factors, where the monthly share of the 
quarterly calendar-adjusted data serves as the 
weight. If it is postulated that relationship (5) is sat-isfied even when there is no calendar influence, then
(8) 
Tt · St · It =  tt(1) · st(1) · it(1) + tt(2) · st(2) · it(2)  
+ tt(3) · st(3) · it(3).
Ct can therefore be determined on the basis of 
monthly data by inserting equation (8) into equation 
(7). This takes the varying month-specific importance 
of the calendar effect in the quarterly series into ac-
count. Thus, the share of a monthly calendar factor in the quarterly factor generally does not correspond to one-third.Deriving quar-
terly calendar factors from monthly time series
9 Depending on the index type, in some cases considerably 
more complex mathematical relationships can result be -
tween the monthly and quarterly values. When this is the 
case, the following remarks are to be adjusted accordingly.Deutsche Bundesbank
