Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The available indicators show that the German 
economy probably grew at a moderate pace in 
the second quarter. Industrial output is unlikely 
to have fully matched its first-quarter level, al -
though this was probably more than offset by 
buoyant construction activity and the continu -
ing upturn in the services sector. Despite the 
persistent economic difficulties in the euro area 
and the global slowdown, German exporters 
were able to expand their business. Import ac -
tivity, too, has picked up again. The consumer 
climate and households‘ propensity to pur -
chase received major stimulus from rising 
wages and growing employment.
The outlook for future economic growth is 
marked by great uncertainty. German industry 
received a higher volume of orders in April and 
May, but enterprises sharply scaled back their 
business expectations in June.
Industry
Industrial output in May was 1¾% up on the 
month in seasonally adjusted terms. In this 
context, it should be noted that production in 
April was depressed by a “bridge day” at the 
end of the month. On an average of April and 
May, output was ½% down on the first three 
months of the year, although the figure for the 
first quarter was admittedly overstated owing 
to a large number of late reports in the mech -
anical engineering sector. lf the various special 
factors are left aside, a sideways movement in 
economic activity is revealed. The slight losses 
in the capital goods sector were chiefly due to 
car production. Intermediate goods output was 
expanded again somewhat, while there was a 
further cutback in the production of consumer 
goods.Orders received by German industry in May 
were slightly (½%) up on the month. The aver -
age for April and May was 1% higher than the 
average of the first quarter, mainly on account 
of increased orders for capital goods. In re -
gional terms, the rise in orders from non-euro-
area countries continued, albeit at a slower 
pace. As in the preceding months, there was 
little change in the volume of domestic orders. 
This contrasted with a sharp increase in orders 
from the rest of the euro area, behind which 
were sizeable aircraft orders from non-euro-
area countries, however, which led to orders 
being subcontracted to Germany. If these were 
to be assigned to the country of the party that 
originally placed the order, the increase in euro-
area demand would be considerably lower. 
Even so, there was no continuation of the cri -
sis-related downturn in orders from the euro 
area.
Industrial sales in May were 1% up on the 
month. There was an especially sharp increase 
in consumer goods, while growth in intermedi -
ate and capital goods was subdued. Industry 
achieved only a small increase in domestic 
sales, but exports showed growth of 1½%. 
There was a 4% increase in the value of exports 
compared with April. Imports showed a very 
sharp rise of 6¼%, in fact. While a moderate 
upward trend in exports continued in April and 
May, the weak figure in April led to a slight fall 
in the value of imports compared with the first 
quarter, although there was an increase in real 
terms.
Construction
After construction activity had been depressed 
in April by the “bridge day” towards the end of 
the month, it expanded by 3% in May. On an 
average of April and May, output was 5% up 
on the first quarter with only minor differences 
between general building and civil engineering. Moderate

Construction orders in April – more recent data 
are unavailable at present – were 1¾% down 
on the first quarter. This mainly affected build -
ing construction (-3%), while there was hardly 
any change in civil engineering (-½%).
Labour market
The positive trend in employment continued in 
the second quarter. The month-on-month in -
crease in the number of persons in work in 
Germany in May, at a seasonally adjusted 
37,000, was roughly as strong as in the period 
from February to April. The year-on-year in -
crease was 561,000, or 1.4%. In the case of 
employment subject to social security contribu -
tions, on which interest is focused, the annual 
figure was up by as much as 666,000, or 2.4%. 
The number of persons solely in part-time 
low-paid work declined again slightly, however. 
According to the ifo employment barometer, 
firms‘ willingness to recruit new staff has stabil -
ised in expansionary territory after declining in 
previous months. The Federal Employment 
Agency‘s BA-X job index fell again somewhat 
from an already elevated level.
In June, the official unemployment figure went 
up slightly to a seasonally adjusted 2.88 mil -
lion. By contrast, the unemployment rate (using 
the Federal Employment Agency‘s definition) 
remained at 6.8%. Underemployment as calcu -
lated by the Federal Employment Agency shows 
a slight seasonally adjusted increase for the first 
time since 2009, in fact. Even so, it was 
246,000 lower than one year previously, com -
pared with a fall of 84,000 in registered un -
employment. The decline in underemployment 
is therefore still clearly lagging behind the rise 
in employment.
Prices
The price for a barrel of Brent fell sharply again 
in June following the global deterioration in the 
outlook for the economy and was 13% down Continued

on the average for May. Latterly, it has been 
rising again owing to geopolitical tensions in 
the Persian Gulf, however. As this report went 
to press, the price stood at US$107½. Crude 
oil futures were being quoted at marked dis -
counts (US$2¼ six months ahead and US$4½ 
12 months ahead).
Overall import prices in May were 0.7% down 
on the month in seasonally adjusted terms 
owing to lower energy prices. Prices were un -
changed if energy is excluded. The energy-
related decline in domestic sales was 0.4%. 
Here, too, prices were stagnating if energy is 
excluded. The year-on-year figures went down 
to 2.2% in the case of import prices and 
to 2.1% in the case of producer prices.
Seasonally adjusted consumer prices in June 
were unchanged on the month. Fuel prices fell 
perceptibly in the wake of declining crude oil 
prices, but food prices accelerated owing to 
the weather. Services became more expensive, 
too, although the prices of industrial goods 
showed little change if energy is excluded. An -
nual inflation declined from 1.9% to 1.7% in 
the national CPI and from 2.2% to 2.0% in the 
HICP .
Public finances1
Local government finances
According to the latest cash data from the Fed -
eral Statistical Office, in the first quarter of 
2012, local governments’ deficit (core budgets 
plus off-budget entities which belong to the 
general government sector)2 fell by just over 
€½ billion on the year to just under €5 billion. 
Revenue rose by 2½% (or €1 billion). General 
grants from state government made the largest 
individual contribution to this increase (+5½%, 
or €½ billion). Tax revenue rose by 2½% over -
all, while gross business tax revenue virtually 
stagnated. Expenditure was up by only just 
over ½% (just under €½ billion) on the year. 
Personnel costs even decreased slightly owing to a one-off payment to salaried employees in 
2011 and to the fact that the pay rise of 3.5%, 
which was negotiated at the end of March 
2012, had yet to be paid. Growth in other op -
erating expenditure (½%) and spending on so -
cial benefits (1½%) remained subdued overall. 
There was a notable decline in fixed asset for -
mation (-6½%, or just under €½ billion) due to 
the phasing out of central government’s invest -
ment programme, which was initiated in 2009 
during the economic crisis.
According to the May 2012 tax estimate, local 
government tax revenue is expected to increase 
significantly (+5%) in 2012. Current transfers 
from state government budgets are also ex -
pected to rise markedly as a result of the fa -
vourable development of state government tax 
revenue as well as central government’s as -
sumption of a higher share of the costs of the 
basic allowance for the elderly and disabled 
since the beginning of 2012.3 Court rulings 
stipulating that state governments have to as -
sume an increased share of the payments im -
posed on local government (such as childcare 
costs for infants) could further reinforce this 
development. As the fall in fixed asset forma -
tion, which is expected to continue throughout 
2012, is largely connected to declining invest -
ment grants, the resulting net relief for local 
government budgets is likely to remain limited. 
The foreseeable notable rise in personnel ex -
penditure as a result of the wage agreement is 
not likely to exceed the relief mentioned above. International

1 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Reports (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain a detailed description of 
the development of public finances during the preceding 
quarter. For detailed data on budgetary developments and 
public debt, see the statistical section of this report.
2 In 2011, the Federal Statistical Office’s reporting popula -
tion was extended to include these outsourced entities. 
This change means that marked distortions in the data, 
which had previously arisen as a result of organisational 
reforms, can, in principle, be avoided.
3 The decisions taken by central and state government on 
the implementation of the fiscal compact at the end of 
June 2012 additionally comprise, inter alia, a modification 
to this cost accounting, which is intended to provide add -
itional relief for local government of €½ billion per year 
during a transitional period.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
July 2012

Consequently, at least a further distinct decline 
in the deficit is on the cards.
Credit market debt increased moderately to 
€85½ billion, which was €½ billion higher than 
the figure posted at the end of 2011. By con -
trast, growth in outstanding cash advances (€3 
billion) was once again considerably stronger. 
This form of financing, which is actually only 
intended to bridge short-term liquidity short -
falls, thus once again increased significantly to 
€48 billion at the end of March 2012. As be -
fore, the increase focused particularly on local 
governments in the federal states of Hesse, 
North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate 
and Saarland. The increase per capita  in this 
group of states was almost eight times as high 
as in the other non-city states. The level of just 
over €1,300 per inhabitant (the equivalent of 
90% of regular credit market debt per capita  in 
this group of states) was also far above the fig -
ure of around €200 recorded on average in the 
other non-city states. There is thus clearly an urgent need for action in this respect. In the 
many local governments that have had 
long-term budgetary constraints imposed upon 
them by the supervisory bodies, one would ac -
tually expect the potential for consolidation to 
have largely been exhausted. Central govern -
ment’s assumption of a greater share of the 
costs for the basic allowance or – as recently 
announced in connection with the implemen -
tation of the European fiscal compact – for in -
tegration assistance for disabled persons pro -
vides marked relief. However, at the same time, 
it increases the financial strength of many local 
governments with surpluses. It is ultimately up 
to state parliaments to provide appropriate 
support to those local governments that prove 
that they have done all that can be reasonably 
expected of them but are still at risk of becom -
ing overindebted. Some states have at least 
taken the first steps in this direction by introdu -
cing partial debt assumption programmes.
Statutory health  
insurance scheme
In the first quarter of 2012, the health insur -
ance institutions and the health insurance fund 
combined recorded a surplus of €½ billion, 
which was half the size of the figure recorded 
one year previously. While the health insurance 
institutions saw virtually no change in the level 
of their surplus (€1½ billion), the health insur -
ance fund’s deficit doubled to €1 billion. At just 
over 3½%, overall expenditure once again in -
creased at a faster pace than revenue (2½%).
Health insurance institutions’ revenue (in the 
form of transfers from the health insurance 
fund) rose by 3½%, as did its expenditure. In 
year-on-year terms, expenditure once again 
grew at a faster pace than in the previous quar -
ters. This affected spending on pharmaceut -
icals in particular, which rose by just over 3½%. 
In this context, the higher manufacturer dis -
counts, which have been in force since August 
2010, now have hardly any dampening effect 
on the rate of change. However, during the Worrying devel-
opments in cash advances in some states2012 Q1 surplus down by half on the year

first quarter, expenditure increased less strongly 
than forecast for 2012 as a whole by the group 
of statutory health insurance estimators in au -
tumn 2011 (+4½%). As the pre-defined trans -
fers from the health insurance fund are made 
on a continual basis irrespective of develop -
ments in expenditure, and the health insurance 
institutions’ own revenue (eg from additional 
contributions) currently plays only a minor role, 
the health insurance institutions consequently 
also posted a more favourable-than-expected 
financial result.
The health insurance fund’s expenditure (pri -
marily transfers to the health insurance institu -
tions) grew at a distinctly stronger pace (3½%) 
than its revenue (2½%). As there was no 
change in the contribution rate, contribution 
receipts increased considerably more sluggishly 
(3½%) than in 2011, when the general contri -
bution rate was raised from 14.9% to 15.5%. 
Employee contributions recorded particularly 
strong growth (almost 5%). This reflects the 
ongoing favourable employment and wage de -
velopments. Weaker growth in pensioner con -
tributions (just over +1%) and the continued 
decline in contributions for recipients of un -
employment benefits (almost -4½%) both had 
a dampening effect. Central government grants 
for 2012 have been reduced considerably to 
€14 billion (2011: €15.3 billion) as planned and 
are to be kept at this level on a permanent 
basis. Despite posting a deficit in the first quar -
ter, the health insurance fund is expected to re -
cord a surplus for the year as a whole, owing 
to higher contribution receipts, particularly to -
wards the end of the year. These are currently 
likely to be markedly higher than forecast by 
the group of statutory health insurance estima -
tors in autumn 2011 (just over +€¼ billion).
For 2012 as a whole, both the health insurance 
fund and the health insurance institutions are 
expected to record renewed surpluses, al -
though these are likely to be distinctly lower 
than in 2011. In 2013, the planned one-off €2 
billion reduction in central government grants 
to the health insurance fund will also restrict the financial scope of the health insurance in -
stitutions somewhat. However, given the fa -
vourable starting position, this will probably be 
offset by large reserves. Nevertheless, looking 
ahead, it appears likely that over the coming 
years healthcare expenditure will regularly rise 
at a faster pace than income subject to com -
pulsory insurance contributions. The currently 
high level of reserves will therefore probably be 
depleted in the foreseeable future.

lion were issued. The outstanding amount of 
foreign debt securities in Germany increased by 
€9.7 billion during the month under review, 
with the result that the total volume of debt 
instruments in the German market went up by 
€17.0 billion.
In May, the public sector issued debt securities 
worth €18.1 billion net (after issuing €4.1 bil -
lion in April). The bulk of this paper (€13.6 bil -
lion) was issued by central government. Its 
main borrowing conduit was two-year Schätze 
(€5.8 billion). Furthermore, central government 
increased the outstanding amount of five-year 
Bobls by €4.4 billion as well as ten-year and 
thirty-year Bunds by €3.4 billion and €0.2 bil -
lion respectively. The resolution agency, which 
is classified as part of central government, re -
deemed a small amount of securities. The state 
governments tapped the capital market for 
€4.5 billion on balance.In the reporting month, domestic credit institu -
tions further reduced their capital market bor -
rowing by €9.9 billion (after cutting it back by 
€5.7 billion in April). They primarily redeemed 
public Pfandbriefe (€5.9 billion) and other bank 
debt securities (€4.9 billion). In addition, the 
outstanding amount of debt securities issued 
by specialised credit institutions, which include 
public promotional banks, for example, de -
creased slightly (€0.4 billion). This contrasted 
with net issuance of mortgage Pfandbriefe 
(€1.4 billion).
Domestic enterprises, too, redeemed €0.9 bil -
lion worth of own bonds in net terms in May, 
compared with net issuance of €0.5 billion in 
April. On balance, these were exclusively debt 
instruments with a maturity of more than one 
year. By contrast, short-dated bonds and notes 
with a maturity of one year or less were issued 
in the amount of 1.9 billion net, almost exclu -
sively by non-financial corporations.
Foreign investors were the sole purchasers in 
May (€29.6 billion). Residents disposed of 
interest-bearing securities for €12.5 billion net 
across all sectors, with these sales being 
roughly divided between domestic credit insti -
tutions (€6.5 billion) and other sectors (€5.8 
billion). The Deutsche Bundesbank was likewise 
among the sellers (€0.3 billion).
Equity market
In the month under review, domestic enter -
prises placed a higher volume of new shares in 
the German equity market (€0.7 billion) than in 
April (€0.1 billion). The volume of foreign shares 
in the German market increased by €3.6 billion 
over the same period. Equities were purchased 
solely by foreign investors on balance (€11.0 
billion). Residents sold shares to the net value 
of €6.8 billion. However, there was a certain 
divergence between the sectors. Thus whereas 
domestic credit institutions offloaded equities 
totalling €13.7 billion from their portfolios, do -Increased use of

(€3.4 billion) and specialised funds reserved for 
institutional investors (€1.5 billion) benefited 
from this. Of the funds open to the general 
public, it was primarily equity funds that sold 
share units (€2.5 billion). Bond-based funds 
and mixed funds also encountered some de -
mand (together €0.9 billion). The outstanding 
volume of foreign mutual fund units traded in 
Germany decreased by €0.6 billion in the re -
porting month. On balance, mutual fund shares 
were bought exclusively by foreign investors in 
May (€5.0 billion). Residents disposed of mu -
tual fund shares to the value of €0.7 billion net. 
These disposals were accounted for exclusively 
by resident credit institutions, which sold off 
both domestic and foreign mutual fund shares 
(€3.4 billion and €0.8 billion respectively).
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur -
plus – in unadjusted terms – of €9.0 billion in 
May 2012. The result was thus €2.1 billion 
lower than in the previous month. This de -
crease was due to the fact that the improve -
ment in the trade surplus was more than offset 
by the increase in the deficit on invisibles, 
which comprise services, income and current 
transfers.
According to provisional figures from the Fed -
eral Statistical Office, in May the foreign trade 
surplus rose by €0.8 billion on the month to 
€15.3 billion. However, after adjustment for 
seasonal and calendar variations, it went down 
by €1.1 billion to €15.0 billion. Following a pro -
nounced fall in the previous month, the value 
of both exports and imports grew strongly, at Inflows to

3.9% and 6.3% respectively. In April and May 
as a whole, seasonally adjusted nominal ex -
ports were 1.3% above the first-quarter aver -
age, although price effects are unlikely to have 
played a role here. Imports declined slightly by 
0.3%, although in price-adjusted terms they 
actually saw an increase on account of an ap -
preciable drop in import prices.
In May, Germany’s deficit on invisibles widened 
to stand at €3.5 billion, following a deficit of 
€1.2 billion in April. This was largely attribut -
able to the turnaround in cross-border income, 
which recorded net expenditure of €0.8 billion 
in the reporting month after posting net in -
come of €0.9 billion in the previous month. The 
main causal factor were the generally relatively 
high dividend payments made to non-residents 
in May of each year. The services sub-account 
likewise recorded a deficit which amounted to 
€1.0 billion, following a net surplus of €0.6 bil -
lion in April. By contrast, the deficit in current 
transfers decreased by €1.0 billion to a total of 
€1.7 billion.
In May, cross-border portfolio investment re -
sulted in net capital imports (€34.4 billion), af -
ter generating outflows in April (€13.4 billion). 
This shift was mainly due to foreign investors 
becoming net buyers (€45.6 billion) instead of 
sellers (€20.0 billion). They acquired not just 
debt securities (€29.6 billion) but also shares 
(€11.0 billion) and mutual fund shares (€5.0 bil -
lion). German investors also returned to pur -
chasing securities on a cross-border basis (€11.1 
billion), after selling paper in the previous 
month (€6.6 billion). In addition to acquiring 
bonds worth €6.2 billion, particularly those de -
nominated in euro, they bought foreign money 
market paper (€3.6 billion) and shares (€2.1 bil -
lion).In May, direct investment again resulted in net 
capital exports (€1.4 billion, down from €7.0 
billion in April). At the same time, German en -
terprises boosted their foreign investment by 
€2.2 billion, which, on balance, was achieved 
exclusively in the form of equity capital trans -
fers. Foreign proprietors provided their branches 
in Germany with funds amounting to €0.8 bil -
lion; in net terms, this was achieved exclusively 
by means of financial loans.
Other statistically recorded investment, com -
prising financial and trade credits (inasmuch as 
these do not constitute a part of direct invest -
ment) as well as bank deposits and other as -
sets, saw net capital exports of €45.5 billion in 
May. Non-banks reported outflows of funds 
worth €9.7 billion, of which €4.2 billion were 
accounted for by the activities of enterprises 
and households and €5.5 billion resulted from 
the operations of general government. The 
banking system likewise recorded outflows of 
funds (€35.8 billion), with cross-border transac -
tions by credit institutions generating net capi -
tal exports of €20.0 billion. The Bundesbank’s 
external position rose by €15.8 billion as a re -
sult of transactions. Two divergent develop -
ments were instrumental here. On the one 
hand, the Bundesbank’s claims arising from 
transactions executed using its TARGET2 pay -
ment system saw a sharp increase (€54.4 bil -
lion). At the same time, however, the Bundes -
bank’s liabilities grew considerably in May 
(€38.6 billion), primarily on account of in -
creased deposits by non-euro-area central 
banks.

The euro as an anchor currency  
and core of a currency bloc
The global monetary system comprises a variety of exchange rate arrangements. These range 
from floating exchange rates, more or less strictly fixed exchange rate pegs, to the use of a single 
currency, as in a monetary union. However, the official exchange rate regime does not always 
match the arrangements actually in place.
Two major currency blocs have emerged in the global monetary system. In addition to the US 
dollar, it is above all the euro that is used in many countries as legal tender or as an anchor cur -
rency. The two currency blocs embrace a similar number of countries and dependent territories 
(around 60) although, measured by gross domestic product, the euro bloc is slightly smaller. In 
terms of its composition, however, the euro bloc has proved to be exceptionally stable.
This article gives an overview of the exchange rate arrangements in common use and discusses 
some of the implications of selecting a particular regime. It analyses the economic determinants 
that are conducive to membership of the euro or US dollar bloc. In this context, the article also 
considers whether a country’s economic structure may make it appear expedient to abandon its 
existing monetary regime. This turns out not to be the case for any of the European countries in 
the euro bloc. However, countries’ underlying structural suitability for using or being pegged to 
the euro cannot per se ensure an ongoing friction-free exchange rate regime. Instead, this requires 
national economic policies to be stringently adapted to the conditions of a fixed exchange rate 
system or monetary union.Deutsche Bundesbank

Overview of different 
 exchange rate arrangements
Under the statutes of the International Monet -
ary Fund (IMF), member states have been free 
since the late 1970s to select which exchange 
rate regime they use, although they must re -
port their current arrangements to the IMF 
once a year. However, various studies have re -
vealed a discrepancy in many cases between 
the officially reported exchange rate regime 
and the arrangements actually in place.1 In the 
meantime, a number of schemes have been 
developed to classify exchange rate arrange -
ments based on actual practice rather than the 
countries’ official notifications.2 The IMF 
reacted by drawing a distinction between de 
jure exchange rate systems, ie those reported 
by the member states, and de facto  arrange -
ments, ie those actually in use, and in Novem -
ber 1998 began publishing a de facto  classifi -
cation of each member state’s regime.3
A fundamental distinction can be drawn be -
tween fixed exchange rate regimes, under 
which domestic monetary policy is subordin -
ated to the external primacy of the fixed ex -
change rate target, and floating or flexible ex -
change rate arrangements, which allow mon -
etary policy to have a domestic focus. The most 
stringent form of a fixed exchange rate regime 
is a system under which countries completely 
refrain from having a legal tender of their own 
and instead adopt the currency of the anchor 
country. In regimes which keep their own legal 
tender, the fixation of their currency’s exchange 
rate is particularly strict in the case of a cur -
rency board. A law is passed stipulating that, 
first, the exchange rate against the anchor cur -
rency is irrevocably fixed and, second, that the 
monetary base may vary only in line with the 
foreign currency reserves. At the opposite end 
of the spectrum to fixed exchange rate ar -
rangements are floating exchange rate regimes, 
in which parities are determined by the market.
Between the two above extremes is a con -
tinuum of exchange rate arrangements with a varying degree of exchange rate flexibility. 
Under conventional arrangements with fixed 
exchange rates, monetary policy is geared pri -
marily to defending the fixed exchange rate 
parity, although the central rate may be ad -
justed in certain circumstances – ie in the event 
of a fundamental balance of payments disequi -
librium. A distinction may be made between 
fixed central rates with and without a horizon -
tal band, whereby band regimes – such as the 
European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) II 
(see page 17) – allow the exchange rate a mar -
gin of fluctuation either side of the fixed central 
rate and therefore permit a greater degree of 
flexibility. This must be distinguished from ex -
change rate regimes with a crawling peg, in 
which inflation differentials between the coun -
tries concerned are offset by pre-announced 
systematic realignments of the central rate.
Of the 190 IMF member countries in total, at 
last count (April 2011), 92 had opted for fixed 
exchange rate regimes.4 32 states had various 
hybrid systems, and 66 flexible exchange rate 
arrangements. The IMF classifies all euro-area 
countries that let the euro float freely against 
other currencies as being in the group with 
flexible currency arrangements. Insofar as this Classification

the study of G A Calvo and C M Reinhart (2002), Fear of 
floating, Quarterly Journal of Economics 117, pp 379-408, 
which concluded that the “official” classification was often 
incorrect, especially for those countries reporting flexible 
exchange rate regimes.

4 For the purpose of this classification, the IMF categories 
“No separate legal tender”, “Currency board”, “Conven -
tional peg”, “Stabilized arrangement” and “Pegged ex -
change rate within horizontal bands” were assigned to the 
group of fixed-rate systems, while the categories “Floating” 
and “Free floating” were allocated to the group of flexible-
rate regimes. See IMF (2011), Annual Report on Exchange

also applies to the other major global curren -
cies, such as the US dollar and the yen, the cur -
rent global monetary system is dominated by 
flexible-rate regimes. Between one another, 
however, the euro-area countries apply the 
most stringent form of exchange rate fixation 
as they comprise a joint monetary union. Hence 
while the euro area as a whole, with its freely 
floating external euro, is at one end of the 
spectrum of exchange rate regimes, its individ -
ual member states, by surrendering their re -
spective national currency and communitising 
monetary policy, are at the other end of the 
spectrum as regards their mutual internal cur -
rency relationship.The wide range of exchange rate arrangements 
indicates that no regime is intrinsically superior 
to the rest. This is confirmed by the fact that 
many countries have adopted different ex -
change rate regimes in the course of time. 
Whether a fixed or a flexible exchange rate sys -
tem is better suited to achieving the macroeco -
nomic goals of price stability, high employ -
ment, steady and appropriate economic 
growth and external equilibrium depends on 
the particular constellation of circumstances, 
which can change over time. Klein and Sham -No exchange

The implications of alternative exchange rate regimes
In accordance with the trilemma of monet-
ary policy, which became clearly evident fol-
lowing the collapse of the Bretton Woods 
global fi  xed exchange rate system, it is im-
possible to freely combine fi  xed exchange 
rates, free movement of capital and inde-
pendent monetary policy. Ultimately, fi  xed 
exchange rate regimes only work in a fi  nan-
cial system with free capital fl  ows if a do-
mestically oriented monetary policy is aban-
doned in the event of a confl  ict of aims in 
favour of the monetary policy of the anchor 
currency country.
An externally oriented monetary policy and 
the associated loss of independence can, 
however, be justifi  ed if the effectiveness of 
a domestically oriented monetary policy is 
limited and the price stability of the anchor 
currency country can be “imported” by 
means of a fi  xed exchange rate peg. A fur-
ther major advantage of fi  xed exchange 
rates is seen in the decline in exchange 
rate uncertainty and volatility. This presup-
poses, however, that monetary policy is 
geared to defending the exchange rate tar-
get and that the fi  xed exchange rates are 
credible. Krugman,1 for instance, used a 
theoretical model to show that the cred-ible announcement of an exchange rate target can per se have a stabilising effect 
on the exchange rate. The logic behind this is that the exchange rate is not determined solely by fundamentals and random fl  uctu-
ations but also by expectations regarding 
exchange rate changes. Such expectations have a destabilising effect – via speculation 
– if the central bank’s forex market inter-
ventions are not credible and market play-
ers anticipate a realignment or a regime change towards greater exchange rate 
fl  exibility.As a result of the legally binding pegging to 
an internationally recognised anchor cur-
rency, a currency board immediately creates 
confi  dence in monetary policy, which is why it enjoys a relatively high degree of 
credibility. In regimes that have a looser ex-change rate peg, however, the credibility of the exchange rate targets is limited and ex-change rate risk cannot be eliminated com-pletely. On the one hand, the option of ad-
justing the central rate has the advantage that fundamental macroeconomic imbal-
ances can be reduced by adjusting the ex-
change rate. At the same time, however, defending the central rate becomes less credible. If an exchange rate band is add-itionally set up around the central parity rate, within which the exchange rate can 
fl  oat freely, the central bank can, albeit to a 
limited extent, pursue an independent 
monetary policy. Safeguarding the credibil-
ity of the regime does, however, require 
that the monetary policy scope be used to 
stabilise infl  ation expectations. The success 
of such a policy ultimately depends on the 
national central bank’s monetary policy 
reputation. Finally, for a transitional period 
during which infl  ation differentials between 
the individual countries are very large, crawling-peg regimes may be suitable for 
stabilising the real exchange rate and thus 
price competitiveness.

baugh,5 who examined the exchange rate ar -
rangements of a total of 125 countries from 
1973 to 2004, found that, on average, these 
countries changed their exchange rate regime 
every five years. Eichengreen detects a trend in 
the 1980s and early 1990s towards abandon -
ing regimes with adjustable fixed rates or with 
fluctuation bands in favour of irrevocably fixed 
or freely floating exchange rates.6 He expressly 
welcomes this development, given the preced -
ing crises within the European Monetary Sys -
tem and the destabilising danger of specula -
tion. By contrast, Frankel is of the opinion that, 
given sufficient convergence and credibility, 
currency arrangements that permit a certain, 
but limited, degree of exchange rate flexibility 
can be a viable alternative, and that the re -
gimes at the two opposite poles of the cur -
rency policy continuum can themselves come 
under pressure as a result of speculation.7
The euro bloc
The euro bloc may be defined as comprising all 
the countries and regions that use the euro as 
legal tender or whose currency is pegged to it. 
This area is shown in the maps on pages 18 
and 19. The core of the euro bloc comprises 
the 17 euro-area member states: Austria, Bel -
gium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France (includ -
ing a number of French overseas territories)8, 
Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, 
Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, the Slovak 
Republic, Slovenia and Spain. Furthermore, the 
euro is used as legal tender in four European 
micro-states and three additional French over -
seas territories.9 The same is true of Monte -
negro and Kosovo, which have opted for uni -
lateral euroisation. In return for adopting the 
euro, they have waived the right to issue their 
own currency without the Eurosystem having 
entered into any obligations with them.
ERM II currently comprises the three countries 
Denmark,10 Latvia and Lithuania.11 ERM II mem -
bers have pegged their currencies to the euro. 
Their central banks, together with the Eurosys -tem, prevent the bilateral exchange rate of 
their currency against the euro from departing 
from a fixed band around the central rate by 
pursuing a stability-oriented monetary policy 
and – if necessary – by intervening on the for -
eign exchange market. For the Danish krone, 
this band is set at ± 2.25%; for the other cur -
rencies at ±15%. Both the Latvian and the 
Lithuanian authorities have committed unilat -
erally to a much stricter euro peg which places 
no additional obligations on the ECB. Thus Lat -
via ensures that the euro exchange rate does 
not fluctuate more than ±1% from the central 
rate. The Bank of Lithuania stabilises its central 
euro exchange rate by means of a currency 
board arrangement.
Outside of ERM II, two other countries have 
pegged their currencies to the euro via a cur -
rency board arrangement: Bosnia and Herze -
govina, and Bulgaria. A number of African 
states12 as well as the French territories of the 
CFP franc zone13 have pegged their currencies 
to the euro via conventional fixed exchange

public of Macedonia formally lets its exchange 
rate float freely, in practice it is likewise pegged 
to the euro.
The monetary policy of two other countries is 
less stringently based on the euro, meaning 
that they cannot actually be included in the 
euro bloc and hence are not to be found on 
the maps shown.14 For a time, Croatia stabil -
ised its currency against the euro; however, in 
other phases, it also allowed a gradual shift in 
value. The IMF recently classified the Croatian 
exchange rate regime as a crawl-like arrange -
ment.15 At the start of September 2011, follow -ing a considerable appreciation of the Swiss 
franc in the wake of the debt crisis that befell 
certain euro-area countries and the resulting 
capital inflows into Switzerland, the Swiss Na -
tional Bank set a minimum euro exchange rate 
for the Swiss franc and announced that it Special cases:

14 The euro exchange rate also plays a certain role in the 
monetary policy of those countries that have pegged their 
currencies to a currency basket that includes the euro. As 
far as is known, this is true of all currency baskets currently 
in use, with the exception of Tonga. As the monetary policy 
of these countries is also influenced by exchange rates 
against currencies other than the euro, they cannot be as -
signed to any currency bloc. Countries in this group are 
listed in ECB, The International Role of the Euro, July 2011,

rency to defend it. So far in 2012, the exchange 
rate has always been close to this floor. The 
euro reference exchange rate published by the 
ECB has remained between the minimum ex -
change rate of CHF 1.20 and CHF 1.22.
The euro bloc as defined above comprises 59 
countries and regions. Its economic focus is in 
Europe but it also includes, above all in Africa, 
a number of states and areas that, until the 
second half of the twentieth century, were or 
still are politically dependent on what are now 
euro-area countries or on Denmark. In 2010, 
the euro bloc earned one-fifth of global value added or, in terms of purchasing power par -
ities, one-sixth.16

definition as that applied to the euro bloc, the 
US dollar bloc comprised 63 countries and re -
gions at the end of April 2011.18 Although this 
is a similar number to that of the euro bloc, the 
aggregate gross domestic product (GDP) of the 
US dollar bloc was one-third larger (one-half 
larger measured by purchasing power parities). 
When making such comparisons, it should be 
borne in mind, first, that the economic output 
of the US dollar bloc is generated to a large ex -
tent by one country alone, namely the United 
States, whose GDP on its own exceeds that of 
the euro bloc. Although the euro area similarly 
dominates the euro bloc economically, it differs 
markedly in that it comprises 17 sovereign states. Second, the definition of the currency blocs can have a notable impact on such a 
comparison. In the case of the US dollar bloc 
this is particularly true of China, whose cur -
rency system, following the renminbi’s gradual 
appreciation against the US dollar, is now no longer classified as being pegged to the US 
dollar, as it was in prior years. If it included 
China, the US dollar bloc’s GDP would have 
been much larger still.
A comparison of the geographical composition 
of the two currency blocs initially reveals simi -
larities. Thus like the euro, the US dollar is used 
extensively as an anchor currency on a regional 
basis, chiefly by a number of West Indian is -
lands and in Central America. Unlike the euro, however, the US dollar is also used globally as 
an anchor currency by many oil-exporting 
countries, presumably because oil prices are 
quoted in US dollars. This is especially true of 
the Middle East and Central Asia. But a number 
of other countries around the world also peg 
their currency to the US dollar, such as the 
countries of Indochina (Vietnam, Laos, Cambo -
dia) and Ukraine, which is currently the only 
European country to do so.… compared

A longitudinal study for the period since 1999 
shows that the composition of the euro bloc 
has remained exceptionally stable when com -
pared with the US dollar bloc. Based on the 
IMF’s de facto  classification, only Hungary and 
Croatia have loosened their currency’s tempor -
ary peg to the euro since the launch of monet -
ary union. By contrast, the degree of currency 
fluctuation of the countries belonging to the 
US dollar bloc was much more pronounced. 
However, this by no means implies that the US 
dollar has since become less important as an 
anchor currency. In actual fact, more currencies 
were newly pegged to the dollar in this period 
than were made more flexible.
Criteria for choosing  
the exchange rate regime
The academic literature began back in the 
1960s to identify the conditions under which a 
fixed exchange rate regime is particularly bene -
ficial. Its pioneers were Mundell, McKinnon 
and Kenen.19 Their theory of optimum currency 
areas compares the costs and benefits of mon -
etary integration in relation to structural fea -
tures of the participating economies. The prin -
cipal benefit of monetary integration is that it 
eliminates exchange rate uncertainty and the 
transaction costs that are incurred when ex -
changing currency, hedging exchange rate risks 
and procuring information about future ex -
change rate developments.
Unlike the benefits, which do not fully unfold 
until a single currency has been introduced, the 
costs of monetary integration are also incurred 
if the respective national currencies are main -
tained and their exchange rates are fixed. The 
costs stem from the fact that the option of ad -
justing exchange rates is no longer available as 
an instrument to overcome external macroeco -
nomic disruptions. This can be particularly 
problematic if the countries concerned are af -
fected by these disruptions to varying degrees. 
The size of the costs from these asymmetrically distributed shocks depends on the availability 
of alternative adjustment mechanisms.
Countries with a fixed exchange rate regime or 
in a currency union whose levels of price com -
petitiveness differ no longer have the option of 
counteracting any resulting real economic im -
balance by adjusting the nominal exchange 
rate as this cannot be done without abandon -
ing the exchange rate target or the single cur -
rency. However, instead of varying the nominal 
exchange rate, a country’s price competitive -
ness can generally also be brought into line by 
adjusting wages and product prices. But this 
requires a relatively high degree of wage and 
price flexibility to enable the adjustment pro -
cess to take effect quickly enough. Alterna -
tively, such regional imbalances can also be rec -
tified by means of a cross-border migration of 
production factors, especially workers. Overall, 
countries with flexible labour markets and 
highly mobile production factors are better 
able to cope without exchange rate adjustment 
and are thus better suited to adopting fixed ex -
change rate arrangements.
In a small, open economy, the development of 
domestic prices and costs is highly dependent 
on the exchange rate; hence the exchange rate 
instrument has only a limited effect on chan -
ging the relative prices of domestic and foreign 
goods. For instance, a nominal devaluation of 
the domestic currency often results in a corres -
ponding increase in domestic costs and prices, 
which weakens the effects of the nominal ex -
change rate variation on cross-border relative 
prices. The theory of optimum currency areas 
thus suggests that fixed exchange rates are Composition of

suited rather to very open economies.20 In ac -
tual practice, where several currencies could, in 
principle, be considered as an anchor, this ar -
gument implies that the currency best suited to 
be a country’s anchor currency is that of the 
currency bloc with which the country has close 
trade ties. In addition, given small economies’ 
relatively shallow and narrow financial markets, 
larger cross-border capital flows could lead to 
volatile exchange rate swings. This is another 
reason in favour of fixed exchange rates.
Economies that are strongly diversified and, at 
the same time, have high factor mobility can 
adjust relatively easily and are relatively well 
placed to absorb sector-specific shocks through 
production shifts within the internal economy. 
Asymmetric shocks thus affect only economic 
sectors inside the country in question and do 
not necessarily result in an external imbalance 
that would require the exchange rate to be ad -
justed. Thus the need for exchange rate flexibil -
ity tends to fall with an economy’s rising level 
of diversification.
If economic agents’ behaviour or their eco -
nomic policy preferences are heterogeneous, 
symmetric shocks can likewise result in asym -
metric increases in wages and prices. For in -
stance, weak cross-border demand can mean 
that wage restraint is more pronounced in one 
country than in others. This could be counter -
balanced by adjusting the exchange rate. A 
similar case arises if different inflation rates are 
targeted owing to heterogeneous inflation 
preferences. It follows that fixed exchange 
rates require the countries in question to have 
similar economic structures and preferences.
An empirical study into the 
choice of the euro as legal 
tender or anchor currency
An empirical study examined the fundamental 
structural determinants of choosing the euro as 
the legal tender or anchor currency.21 This an -
alysis methodologically determined the prob -ability of each country and dependent territory 
belonging to the euro bloc (as defined above), 
the US dollar bloc or neither of these blocs.22 
No distinction was made as to whether a coun -
try is a member of the euro area, has unilat -
erally opted for euroisation or has convention -
ally pegged its currency to the euro.
This is because variables from the above-  
mentioned theory of optimum currency areas 
were used as determinants, which, in turn, 
have a bearing on all intensities of currency 
pegging. The importance of these criteria for 
the choice of exchange rate regime has been 
examined and confirmed in many studies.23 
However, the concrete choice of anchor cur -
rency, which is the focal point of the Bundes -
bank discussion paper cited, has mostly been 
disregarded in the literature to date.24
The estimations described in the study find that 
a country with a large real GDP is relatively un -
likely to peg its currency to the euro or another 
currency. Smaller economies are usually more 
dependent on cross-border trade, which gener -
ally entails a higher degree of openness. In 
comparative terms, they also have fewer op -
tions for pursuing an independent monetary 
policy, meaning that the opportunity cost of a 
fixed exchange rate is low. By contrast, the … as well as

study found that a country’s greater relative 
wealth measured in terms of per capita  GDP 
raises the probability of adopting a fixed ex -
change rate regime.25
The likelihood that a country belongs to the 
euro bloc grows with the extent of its trade ties 
to (other) euro bloc countries. This does not 
mean just its trade ties to the euro area itself 
but also to other countries that have pegged 
their currency to the euro. A shorter geograph -
ical distance between the country in question 
and the monetary policy centre of the euro 
area (Frankfurt am Main) proved to be another 
key fundamental indicator of a higher likeli -
hood of its membership of the euro bloc. Rela -
tive geographical proximity, in turn, can be ex -
pected to imply relatively high factor mobility 
plus a higher correlation of economic cycles 
and consumption habits. Furthermore, the esti -
mation shows that many of the countries that 
were dependent at least into the 1960s on one 
of the current members of the euro bloc like -
wise use the euro as an anchor currency.26
Comparing these results with those for the US 
dollar bloc, it likewise turns out that a country 
with a relatively close trade focus on countries 
and regions belonging to the (rest of the) US 
dollar bloc is more likely to belong to the bloc 
itself. However, unlike the euro bloc, the geo -
graphical distance to the US monetary policy 
centre has no significant impact on whether 
the US dollar is adopted as an anchor currency. 
A detailed analysis shows, however, that this 
applies solely to a group of countries that peg 
the exchange rate of their currency to the US 
dollar only temporarily. For countries with a 
permanent peg to the US dollar, geographical 
proximity to the United States plays a similarly 
important role as for countries in the euro bloc. 
The existence of a group of countries that use 
the US dollar as an anchor currency at times 
although most of them are fairly remote from 
the USA distinguishes the US dollar bloc from 
the euro bloc. With regard to this group of 
countries – but only this group of countries – the US dollar can be termed a global anchor 
currency and the euro more as a regional one.
One last variable that was examined in terms of 
its impact on the choice of anchor currency is 
the share of oil exports in total exports. As 
crude oil is traded in US dollars internationally, 
it may be presumed that oil-exporting countries 
prefer to peg their currency to the US dollar so 
as to stabilise the domestic value of their oil 
export revenues. While the estimation does in 
fact show that such a connection exists, it turns 
out to be barely statistically significant.
As the study examines the extent to which 
each country’s economic structure points to 
the likelihood of a euro peg, a US dollar peg or 
a flexible exchange rate regime, the underlying 
model can also indicate whether there are vi -
able alternatives to the regime actually adopted. 
In view of the recent dislocations affecting 
parts of the euro area, such possible alterna -
tives have recently been mooted for individual 
euro-area member states. However, the rele -
vant academic literature on the optimality of a 
single currency area in Europe dates back to 
the early 1990s.27 Such literature usually fo -
cuses on using just one criterion from the the -
ory of optimum currency areas to examine 
whether the conditions in European countries, 
for instance, compared with those in other 
large currency areas such as the USA favour a 
monetary union. This was confirmed for some 
criteria (for instance, for the degree of open -
ness and the diversification of production and 
consumption) but not for others (including Determinants of 
euro bloc mem-bership
Comparison

25 This finding, which was already current in the literature, 
is in line with the above-mentioned classical theory of opti -
mum currency areas insofar as production and consump -
tion structures in richer countries are generally relatively 
diverse. See, for example, M W Klein and J C Shambaugh, 
op cit.
26 In the literature, this finding is justified inter alia by the 
hypothesis that former colonial powers continue to provide 
financial support to their ex-colonies and in this way help 
to smooth cyclical fluctuations. See M W Klein and 
J C Shambaugh, op cit.

An estimation approach to determining the probability 
of joining a currency bloc
A country’s choice of exchange rate regime 
is determined by a number of political and 
economic factors. Using econometric esti-
mations it is possible to calculate the prob-ability that a country will use the euro or US 
dollar as its legal tender or anchor cur-
rency.1 To this end, each country’s exchange 
rate regime is assigned to one of the fol-
lowing four rough categories: euro as legal 
tender or anchor currency (regime 1), US dollar as legal tender or anchor currency 
(regime 2), pegging to a third currency or a currency basket (regime 3), and fl  oating ex-
change rates or hybrid system (regime 4). The choice of one of the aforementioned regimes involves decision-making at two different levels. First, the country must choose the type of exchange rate regime 
(fi  xed or fl  oating exchange rates). If it opts 
for a fi  xed exchange rate regime (and only 
in such cases), it then has to select an an-
chor currency. The “nested logit” approach represents a suitable method for estimating 
such a hierarchically structured decision-
making process.
When applying this approach, it is fi  rst of all 
necessary to distinguish between the prob-ability 
p that a country i will opt for a fi  xed 
exchange rate regime P, piP, and the prob-
ability that it will select a regime based on 
fl  oating exchange rates F, piF = 1 – piP,. If 
the country in question opts for a fi  xed ex-
change rate regime, it is then possible to defi  ne the (conditional) probabilities 
pi1|P 
(euro), pi2|P (US dollar) and pi3|P = 
1 – pi1|P – pi2|P (another currency), depend-
ing on the anchor currency used. Using a nested logit approach, the following (un-conditional) probabilities for the four re-
gimes, pi1, pi2, pi3 and pi4, described above 
are: (1)
 (2)
 (3)
 . (4)
In these equations, z denotes a vector of 
determinants for the fi  rst decision level, ie the choice between a fi  xed exchange rate 
regime and one based on fl  oating exchange 
rates, x1 (x2) a vector of variables that de-
termine the choice of the euro (US dollar) as the anchor currency, and 
α, β1 and β2 the 
corresponding coeffi   cient vectors.2 The ex-
planatory variables used for the estimation 
are derived directly or indirectly from the 
optimum currency area theory described in 
the main text. Vector z contains the loga-
rithmic real GDP of country i and its loga-
rithmic per capita real GDP , vector x1 a 
measure of the trade integration of country 
i with (other) euro bloc countries, the dis-
tance of that country’s capital city from the 
monetary policy-making hub of the euro 
bloc, Frankfurt am Main, and a dummy vari-able which assumes the value of one if the country in question was dependent on one 
of the countries belonging to today’s euro 
bloc up to the 1960s or still is dependent. 
Similarly, vector x2 comprises a measure of 
the level of trade integration with the 
(other) countries in the US dollar bloc and 
the country’s distance from Washington, 
DC. The share of net oil exports in the total

exports of the country in question is fac-
tored into both x1 and x2.
Using a maximum likelihood approach, the 
econometric model can be estimated either in cross-sectional analyses for several differ-ent years or, alternatively, by pooling all the 
data of the entire period. These estimations 
generally deliver statistically signifi  cant coef-
fi  cients for all the variables, except for oil 
exports as a share of total exports and dis-
tance from Washington, DC. Since the 
nested logit model is non-linear, it is easier 
to interpret a table showing the average 
marginal impacts than one detailing the co-effi   cients. For each explanatory variable, the 
adjacent table shows the marginal impact 
of its variation on the probability of opting 
for a given regime or anchor currency. 
Since, in a non-linear model, the size of this 
impact differs for each observation, in this 
case for each country and each year, an 
average value is given.
The table reveals that the signs of the esti-
mated average marginal impacts all corres-
pond to the theoretical expectations. For 
instance, a 1 percentage point increase in a 
country’s share of trade with (other) euro 
bloc countries increases the probability that the country in question is itself a member of 
that bloc by ½ percentage point, whereas 
the likelihood of this being the case for 
each of the three other regimes decreases. Similarly, a high share of trade with (other) 
US dollar bloc countries boosts that coun-
try’s probability of joining the dollar bloc. If 
a given country’s capital city is located 1% 
further away from Frankfurt am Main, then 
the chances of that country being pegged 
to the euro decline by just under 2½%, 
whereas the odds increase for the other re-
gimes. The impact of a country’s distance 
from Washington, DC, along with that of 
oil exports as a share of total trade, turn out 
to be small. Moreover, the likelihood of a given country having a fi  xed exchange rate 
regime rises with greater per capita GDP 
and with smaller real GDP . Last but not 
least, the probability of a country belonging 
to the euro bloc increases by more than 
33 percentage points if an otherwise identi-
cal country once was or still is dependent 
on a (former) European colonial power.Estimated average marginal impact

price and wage flexibility as well as labour mar -
ket integration).28
On the basis of the model presented here and 
considering the impact of all the criteria con -
tained therein, it is also possible to determine 
whether a different monetary system from the 
one currently in place would be preferable.29 It 
transpires that this is not the case for any of the 
countries that currently belong to the euro 
area. However, the robustness of these findings 
needs qualifying because fundamental struc -
tural suitability alone cannot guarantee 
problem-free membership of a monetary union; 
other factors are required, such as responsible 
economic and fiscal policies that take sufficient 
account of the demands of a single currency 
and a single monetary policy in the euro area. 
This is the only way to secure the imperative 
requirement of avoiding excessive tensions in 
the single currency area.
As for the euro-area countries, the findings for 
all other European countries and almost all 
other non-euro-area countries in the euro bloc 
indicate that more flexible exchange rate ar -
rangements would not significantly better fit 
their economic structure. By contrast, the esti -
mations for a number of European states 
whose currency is currently not pegged to the 
euro suggest that their economic structure im -
plies that it would make sense to fix their ex -
change rate against the euro. Of the European 
Union countries, this particularly applies to the 
Czech Republic but also Sweden. Outside of 
the European Union, this is especially the case 
for Switzerland, Iceland, Croatia and Albania.
A caveat applying to all these findings is that 
they are based on a relatively simple approach 
which can by no means take account of all as -
pects of regime choice. For instance, expect -
ations about the internal and external stability 
of a currency also play a role when deciding 
whether to adopt it as an anchor. Persistent failure to achieve the price stability target 
would considerably lessen the attractiveness of 
an anchor currency.30 Another key consider -
ation is the economic policy consequences of 
anchor intensity, which the estimation did not 
differentiate. Defending conventional currency 
pegs has proved, at times, to be difficult, espe -
cially during crises featuring large inward and 
outward capital movements. Finally, in many 
cases the choice of exchange rate regime in -
volves political decisions, and these were like -
wise not captured by the model.
Summary
The euro is the central currency of a major cur -
rency bloc, currently comparable only with the 
US dollar. In addition to the euro-area coun -
tries, this currency bloc includes many other 
countries that use the euro as legal tender or 
that have pegged their own currency to it. An 
empirical study shows that membership of the 
euro bloc, irrespective of whether the country 
in question also belongs to the euro area, can 
be well explained by long-term variables of the 
country’s economic structure. Besides funda -
mental structural suitability of the participating 
economies, persistently responsible wage and 
fiscal policies, in particular, are essential pre -
requisites for ongoing tension-free member -
ship of a currency bloc. The current sovereign 
debt crisis in a number of euro-area countries, 
which was preceded by a phase of growing 
macroeconomic imbalances, has graphically 
underscored this.Economic struc-

Deutsche Bundesbank Spring Conference 
2012 – monetary policy, inflation and 
 international linkages
This year’s Bundesbank Spring Conference, which was co-organised with the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Philadelphia, dealt with the interplay between inflation, international macroeconomic 
linkages and the concomitant challenges for monetary policy. Among other things, the contribu -
tions to the conference illustrated that the welfare gains created by the steadily increasing glob -
alisation of product and financial markets depend heavily on the characteristics of those markets. 
Existing market imperfections and frictions need to be eradicated to the greatest possible extent 
in order to capitalise on increasing international interdependencies.
Constantly growing global integration also has feedback effects on monetary policy. For instance, 
highly volatile prices in the energy and commodity markets or contagion effects in interlinked 
financial markets are presenting new challenges for monetary policy. At the same time, however, 
monetary policymakers also have access to additional information, and thus can make sounder 
judgements. Changes in nominal and real exchange rates, for example, provide important infor -
mation for a monetary policy that is geared towards price stability. The papers presented at the 
conference also looked at various ways in which monetary policy impacts on international capital 
markets. The conference showed how central banks can achieve more accurate forecasts where 
observers are highly unsure about future trends in the international product and financial mar -
kets. The final point of discussion in this context was the contribution that monetary policy can 
make towards stabilising market participants’ expectations regarding future inflation paths in an 
environment of heightened uncertainty.Deutsche Bundesbank

Background
Shaped by the financial and economic crisis, 
the interactions between globalised product 
and capital markets on the one hand and infla -
tion developments and monetary policy on the 
other have come under the spotlight once 
more. In particular, the fact that the economic 
downturn in the fourth quarter of 2008 and 
the first quarter of 2009 spread quickly to 
many countries and affected the economies of 
most industrial countries almost simultaneously 
has reawakened interest in issues concerning 
the international linkages in the product and 
financial markets and the resulting implications 
for economic policy. Central banks around the 
world are also facing new challenges owing to 
increasing levels of international integration. 
There is, moreover, a tendency to assign central 
banks more and more tasks that extend be -
yond their core mandate of maintaining price 
stability. The Bundesbank therefore dedicated 
its Spring Conference this year to the topics of 
monetary policy, inflation and international 
linkages.1
The contributions to this year’s Spring Confer -
ence were pooled around the following ques -
tions.
– What role does the increasing international 
integration of the product markets play in 
factor price movements?
– What bearing does the increasing globalisa -
tion of the financial markets have on a coun -
try’s economic policy and especially on the 
free movement of capital flows?
– To what extent is monetary policy affected 
by strong price fluctuations in the product 
and financial markets in an integrated global 
economy?
– How does monetary policy impact on inter -
national capital markets and exchange rates?– What form should monetary policy take in 
an international environment of heightened 
uncertainty?
International product 
 markets and factor prices
The contribution to the conference by Burstein 
and Vogel2 answered several questions about 
the impact of product market integration on 
factor price movements, especially relative 
wage differences. The authors use a general 
equilibrium model for a variety of countries to 
examine how lower international trade costs 
affect the relative wage developments of skilled 
to unskilled workers (the “skill premium”, the 
wage mark-up for more qualified workers). The 
empirical analysis shows that real wages rise 
for all workers when trade costs fall, but that 
the increase in the relative wages of well-
qualified workers is two to three times greater. 
The authors also show that the intensity of 
relative wage growth depends on country-
specific characteristics. For example, the skill 
premium increase is stronger for more qualified 
workers in small open economies, in particular. 
Furthermore, the rise in the skill premium is not 
necessarily linked to a skill-abundant produc -
tion sector.
This finding suggests that the integration of 
international product markets can be beneficial 
to both qualified and less qualified workers. 
However, the welfare gains from increasing 
globalisation may be unevenly distributed. 
Moreover, Burstein and Vogel observe that, in a 
highly integrated global economy, central 
banks should have an even more differentiated 
view of what is causing wages to grow.Particular chal-
lenges in the light of global-ised product and capital  markets

Economic policy in  globalised 
financial markets
Product and labour markets are characterised 
by a range of market imperfections. For ex -
ample, wage flexibility is generally limited on 
the labour markets, especially if wages need to 
fall in order to create full employment. What 
are the consequences of this in an environment 
of highly integrated product and financial mar -
kets?
In their paper, Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe3 ana-
lyse the interactions between free capital flows 
and fixed nominal exchange rates when wages 
are downwardly rigid. The authors use a selec -
tion of small European economies to show 
that, during an economic upturn, nominal 
wages and current account deficits in these 
countries increased sharply, while unemploy -
ment figures went down. After the onset of the 
crisis, the current account improved and un -
employment rose. However, the latter did not 
lead to a reduction in nominal wages. The 
authors explain this phenomenon using a dy -
namic model of a small open economy with 
downward nominal wage rigidity. They show 
that the combination of fixed exchange rates 
and free capital mobility can have a negative 
income effect on economies if nominal wages 
do not fall following an economic downturn. If 
wages are not adjusted, the consequences 
 include high levels of unemployment, over -
borrowing and an economic depression. 
Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe point out that, to 
counteract these negative economic effects, 
optimal capital controls can increase welfare. 
During expansionary phases, capital controls 
restrict capital inflows and slow the pace of 
economic activity, while they subsidise external 
borrowing during economic downturns.
The conference contribution suggests that the 
potentially negative consequences of the inter -
action between downward wage rigidity and 
increasing financial market integration can be 
economically cushioned using capital market 
controls and macroprudential regulations. However, it should be noted that, for the most 
part, it is not globalised financial markets but 
rather frictions on the labour markets that are 
responsible for a situation of this kind. The ul -
timate aim should therefore be to address the 
root of the problem instead of the symptoms, 
especially as the question of how such capital 
controls could be implemented in a globalised 
economy remains unanswered.
Price fluctuations in the 
product and financial 
 markets in an integrated 
global economy
Presentations by Bodenstein, Guerrieri and Kil -
ian,4 Perri and Quadrini5 as well as Eickmeier 
and Ng6 provided new insights into the ques -
tion of a monetary policy response to strong 
price fluctuations in the product and financial 
markets in an interconnected global economy.
Bodenstein, Guerrieri and Kilian’s conference 
paper examines whether and how monetary 
policymakers should respond to oil price fluctu -
ations. In their analysis, the authors conclude 
that a more detailed analysis is required to de -
termine whether shocks on the supply side or 
on the demand side of the world market are 
the predominant cause of strong oil price fluc -
tuations.7 Demand-led oil price shocks gener -

fects on the potential oil supply at least partially 
cancel each other out. As structural changes 
are difficult to identify promptly and economic 
fluctuations are often the result of several dif -
ferent shocks occurring simultaneously, the 
authors once again emphasise that monetary 
policymakers are reliant on careful analyses of 
underlying causes when deciding how they 
should respond to oil price fluctuations.
Perri and Quadrini highlight the significance of 
credit supply shocks in a globalised economy. 
The authors show that, under these conditions, 
local restrictions in lending –  as observed in 
many countries during the financial crisis – can 
have global real economic effects leading to an 
international recession. Using a two-country 
general equilibrium model, they demonstrate 
that the tightening of credit conditions in one 
country can lead to a state of equilibrium in 
which fully rational economic agents have pes -
simistic expectations of economic growth at 
home and abroad and therefore curtail their 
economic activity. The outcome is a recession 
which is driven by expectations rather than by 
production and which may spread to other 
countries as a result of financial integration. 
Furthermore, the paper shows that the severity 
and duration of a recession caused by the 
tightening of credit conditions is determined by 
the level of borrowing in the preceding upturn.
The paper presented at the conference by Eick -
meier and Ng also deals with the real economic 
effects of credit supply shocks in an integrated 
global economy. The authors use an extensive 
multi-country dataset to produce an empirical 
analysis of the international propagation of 
credit supply shocks to the private sector. The 
focus is on the effects of such shocks originat -
ing in the USA, Japan and the euro area on the 
real economy and the financial sector in these 
three regions as well as on the entire world 
economy. The results show that financial mar -
ket integration can expedite the transmission 
of disturbances in a country’s supply of credit 
to the global real economy. The international 
transmission of US credit supply shocks to for -eign GDP has been observed to be particularly 
strong. However, regardless of the quantitative 
differences revealed, there are qualitative simi -
larities in all three cases.
The aforementioned two presentations suggest 
that global financial and product market inte -
gration combined with country-specific restric -
tions in the supply of credit (as seen in recent 
years) has furthered the current recession in 
some countries. When setting a monetary pol -
icy that directly influences a country’s lending, 
policymakers must therefore bear in mind that 
their measures may also impact on other coun -
tries. The conference contribution by Perri and 
Quadrini in particular illustrates the effects of 
regulating lending. This paper therefore also 
adds to the current discussion about the poten -
tial implications of macroprudential supervi -
sion.
International capital markets 
and exchange rates
The fourth issue discussed at the Spring Con -
ference concerned the impact of monetary pol -
icy on international capital markets and ex -
change rates. In order to stabilise the real econ -
omy, the monetary policy of many countries 
became extremely expansionary during the fi -
nancial crisis. Short-term interest rates fell to 
historic lows in the major currency areas.
In this context, the paper by Backus, Gavaz -
zoni, Telmer and Zin8 provides new answers. 
The theory of interest rate parity on which the 
paper is based (and the observation that this 
theory does not appear to hold true unre -
servedly) has long been a subject of intense de -
bate in macroeconomics, and a large number 
of questions remain unanswered. The confer -
ence paper’s key finding is that different na -
tional monetary policy rules may lead to higher Global real eco-
nomic effects as a result of national credit tightening

inflation and interest rate differentials between 
countries and regions as well as to increasing 
foreign currency risk premiums where monet -
ary policy is less stability-oriented. A further im -
portant conclusion is that monetary policy ac -
tion can trigger high volatility and currency 
flows on the international capital markets, es -
pecially in times of heightened uncertainty.
Another fundamental theoretical issue relates 
to the correlation between savings behaviour 
and stock market returns. The understanding 
of these correlations has an impact on the in -
terpretation of international capital and prod -
uct flows. In their research paper, Albuquerque, 
Eichenbaum and Rebelo9 attempt to reconcile 
conventional asset pricing theories with the 
data available. Using a dynamic equilibrium 
model, the authors present a new, demand-
oriented explanatory approach. In particular, 
they analyse how changes in market partici -
pants’ time preference affects their consump -
tion and savings behaviour and what effects 
this has on asset price developments.
Crucini, Shintani and Tsuruga10 likewise exam -
ine the importance of exchange rate volatilities 
and analyse the relationship between price 
stickiness and exchange rate fluctuations 
against the backdrop of the Law of One Price. 
In particular, the paper brings out the relation -
ship between price stickiness and exchange 
rate volatility using sector-level real exchange 
rate data. In contrast to the conclusions in the 
existing literature, the authors find that an in -
crease in price stickiness is accompanied by a 
decrease in sector-level exchange rate volatility. 
They attribute this result to the predominance 
of real shocks over nominal shocks in explain -
ing the volatility of real exchange rates at the 
sector level. The authors conclude that their re -
sult is contrary to the literature because real 
shocks in prices disappear at the aggregate 
level, meaning that nominal shocks are over -
weighted.
In this context, a deeper understanding of real 
exchange rate data behaviour at the aggregate and the disaggregated level helps to shed light 
on the significance of price stickiness and mon -
etary shocks for exchange rate fluctuations.
Monetary policy in an inter -
national environment  
of heightened uncertainty
The aforementioned research papers presented 
at this year’s Spring Conference provided a 
good basis for the final question raised at the 
conference: what form should monetary policy 
take in an international environment of height -
ened uncertainty? The recent crisis highlighted 
how uncertainty on the financial and product 
markets influences market participants’ expect -
ations and makes it more difficult to process 
new market information systematically. The un -
certainty surrounding future economic devel -
opments in general and inflation in particular 
places high demands on a forward-looking 
monetary policy. Central banks should there -
fore not only take account of the most likely 
future event on average, but should also in -
corporate all possible future real economic and 
inflation developments into their decisions.
Andrade, Ghysels and Idier11 compare the task 
of monetary policy with that of risk manage -
ment. Where risk considerations become in -
creasingly significant, monetary policymakers 
also need suitable measures of risk for the im -
plementation of their policies. This relationship 
is illustrated using the example of inflation risk. 
The authors examine in detail the inflation and 
deflation risks derived from the expectations of 
market participants and then calculate the 
asymmetries of these risks. They show that, in 
the case of the USA, these asymmetries contain The effect of

important information about future inflation 
and that they help to explain monetary policy 
decisions.
Melosi12 demonstrates how monetary policy 
decisions can be better formulated and signal -
ling effects developed if the macroeconomic 
environment is characterised by a large number 
of market participants with different microdata. 
In the model used, the central bank, through 
its actions, signals its expectations about eco -
nomic developments to the market partici -
pants, who have varying degrees of informa -
tion. The impact on the market participants 
depends on the ability to influence expect -
ations. Signalling effects can dampen the re -
percussions of an unexpected monetary policy 
change with regard to inflation. The author 
also illustrates that, in a rapidly changing eco -
nomic environment, such signals help to 
strengthen a central bank’s systematic stabilisa -
tion policy.
In his speech “Macro Models and Monetary 
Policy Analysis”, Charles Plosser, President of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, ad -
dressed various issues which monetary policy -
makers are facing, in particular against the 
backdrop of recent experiences. He called on 
researchers to intensify their efforts to improve 
the way in which today’s conventional models 
approximate underlying rigidities and, in par -
ticular, to better analyse the consequences of 
monetary policy on wage-setting and pricing 
processes. In addition, he suggested that more 
thought be given to realistic monetary policy 
rules and how to ensure their credibility.
In this context, he also pointed out that macro -
economic models should examine both the po -
tential systemic role of a lender of last resort and the institutional environment of monetary 
policy in a more credible manner. Both can lead 
to moral hazard problems with regard to mon -
etary policy, which central banks must bear in 
mind when taking action.
Conclusions
This year’s Spring Conference provided a good 
overview of the current academic debate about 
international macroeconomic linkages and 
their consequences for inflation and the role of 
monetary policy. In particular, the advantages 
and disadvantages of highly integrated product 
and financial markets were presented and the 
challenges for monetary policy associated with 
this were discussed and analysed in the context 
of the core monetary policy mandate of price 
stability. In addition, however, the limits of 
monetary policy and its traditional instruments 
were discussed in the light of the current crisis, 
for example, as a result of the zero lower 
bound on interest rates. In this context, new 
instruments currently under discussion as part 
of macroprudential supervision were also the 
topic of debate.
The conference illustrated that monetary policy 
is facing new major challenges in the wake of 
the recent crisis. Some central banks are en -
countering increasing demands to take on add -
itional tasks, such as ensuring financial stability 
and economic growth. Both the research 
papers presented and the accompanying dis -
cussions highlighted the associated risks of an 
overload.Monetary policy

The new CPSS-IOSCO Principles  
for financial market infrastructures
In April 2012, the Basel Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the Inter -
national Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) published their Principles for financial 
market infrastructures. These principles are designed to make financial market infrastructures 
(FMIs) more stable and more resilient to financial crisis in future. In this respect, the principles 
support the G20 countries’ agreements on reforming the financial markets. The principles are tar -
geted at systemically important payment systems, central securities depositories (CSDs), securities 
settlement systems (SSSs), central counterparties (CCPs) and trade repositories (TRs). From the 
German perspective, this means above all the TARGET2 payment system, which is operated by the 
Eurosystem, the central securities depository Clearstream Banking AG and the central counter -
party Eurex Clearing AG. The currently valid international standards have been harmonised and 
tightened considerably and expanded to cover new aspects. The FMIs are expected to implement 
these principles as soon as possible. Central banks and supervisory authorities are to integrate 
them into their supervisory regimes by end-2012. FMIs and regulatory bodies are currently looking 
into the need for adjustment. The investments that will be necessary and the resultant cost 
increases for FMIs and market participants are the price for the improved safety. Besides the rea -
sons for amending the principles, the present article examines the main elements as well as the 
supervisory authorities’ role. The new principles will further strengthen the role played by the 
Bundesbank in payment and settlement system oversight.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

New challenges face FMIs
FMIs play a central role in the settlement of fi -
nancial transactions, including securities and 
derivatives, or in payments. They are the back -
bone of national and international financial 
markets. FMIs support the real economy and 
facilitate the monetary policy transmission pro -
cess. They are systemically important because 
of the large turnover typically settled via such 
systems, the monopolistic position these sys -
tems often hold and the close interdependen -
cies that exist with market participants and 
other FMIs. If not properly operated and regu -
lated, they can pose serious risks for the finan -
cial system and affect other parties in the event 
of a crisis. The general public is familiar with 
institutions such as stock exchanges, whereas 
those that perform downstream settlement-
related tasks often receive less public attention. 
This article will focus on the latter and look at 
payment systems, CSDs, SSSs, CCPs and TRs. 
For a definition of the individual FMIs, see 
page 35.
Central banks and the supervisors of markets 
and banks have an outstanding interest in miti -
gating risks and remedying weaknesses in sys -
temically important FMIs. This is why, several 
years ago, CPSS and IOSCO drew up their 
“Core principles for systemically important pay -
ment systems”, “Recommendations for secur -
ities settlement systems” and “Recommenda -
tions for central counterparties”.1 Whereas 
CSDs, SSSs and CCPs are presumed to be sys -
temically important, this is true of payment sys -
tems, for instance, only when the payment sys -
tem is the sole system in a country, or, when a 
system handles time-critical payments, large-
value payments or payments are used to effect 
settlement for other FMIs. Above all, this ap -
plies to the real-time gross settlement (RTGS) 
systems that the central banks themselves op -
erate, such as TARGET2.
For the most part, FMIs have functioned 
smoothly during the latest financial crisis. How -
ever, the financial crisis has heightened risk awareness and highlighted the need to take 
acute stress situations into consideration. The 
lessons from the financial crisis and experience 
gained over the last few years in implementing 
the existing oversight standards prompted cen -
tral banks and supervisory authorities to think 
about more stringent requirements for FMIs. 
CPSS and IOSCO therefore proceeded to exten -
sively revise the old standards and merge them 
into a single set of standards. In the process, 
individual standards were tightened, and new 
standards were introduced to cover areas of 
risk that had previously not been addressed. 
The recommendations (“soft laws”), mean -
while, were developed into (minimum) prin -
ciples which the institutions involved in draw -
ing them up have committed to observe.
These new CPSS and IOSCO “Principles for fi -
nancial market infrastructures”, referred to in 
the following as “principles”,2 support the G20 
reform agreements according to which all fi -
nancial markets must be subjected to regula -
tion and adequate oversight. For instance, the 
functioning, transparency and oversight of the 
markets for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives 
are to be improved by the end of 2012. Behind 
these objectives lies the requirement that trad -
ing in standardised OTC derivatives be trans -
ferred to regulated markets. Moreover, as many 
standardised OTC derivatives as possible are to 
be cleared through CCPs in future. Given these 
requirements for mandatory centralised clear -
ing, it is crucial that CCPs achieve a very high 
level of safety. This is particularly true when a 
CCP is used by other national markets. In add -
ition, all OTC derivative contracts are to be re -
ported to TRs so that regulatory authorities can 
obtain a comprehensive overview of the risk FMIs are the 
backbone of na-tional and inter-national finan-cial markets

Overview of fi  nancial market infrastructures included 
in the principles
Payment systems
Payment systems are procedures used by 
participants (as a rule banks) to process payments for themselves or for their cus-
tomers. A distinction is generally made be-
tween retail payment systems and large-
value payment systems (LVPSs). Retail pay-
ment systems normally process a large vol-
ume of relatively low-value payments. By contrast, high-priority or large-value pay-ments, along with settlement of the cash leg of transactions processed by other 
 fi  nancial market infrastructures, are handled by LVPSs.
Central securities depositories
Today, securities are only in very rare cases 
held in physical form by the investors them-
selves or in bank safe deposit boxes. Secur-
ities are nowadays more likely to be either 
immobilised through a central securities de-pository (for example, as a global certifi  cate 
in a vault) or kept in dematerialised form 
(entered in a register with, for example, the 
German Finance Agency). Investors receive 
the ownership rights associated with a se-
curity through a safe custody account, held by the investor’s bank at the respective cen-
tral securities depository. Central securities  depositories thus have a kind of “notary 
function”.
Securities settlement systemsCentral securities depositories also generally 
provide securities settlement systems that 
enable securities to be processed and set-tled by book entry. Securities transactions 
can be settled either “free of payment” or 
“against payment”. In Germany, the central securities depository and securities settle-
ment system functions are performed by a 
single institution, Clearstream Banking AG.
Central counterparties
A central counterparty interposes itself be-
tween two contractual counterparties to 
 fi  nancial market operations transacted 
 either on a stock exchange or over the 
counter (OTC). It thus becomes the buyer 
for every seller (and vice versa) and ensures 
the performance of open contracts. When 
central counterparties apply effective risk management procedures, such as timely 
valuation of risk positions and collateralisa-
tion, they potentially reduce counterparty risk and systemic risk in the fi  nancial mar-
kets.
Trade repositories
A trade repository keeps electronic records 
of fi  nancial transactions. Trade repositories 
are a new type of fi  nancial market infra-
structure, in particular in the OTC deriva-tives market. Supervisory authorities, mar-ket participants and the public have an interest in reliable trade repositories: 
through the centralised collection, storage 
and dissemination of data, they contribute 
to  fi  nancial market transparency. In many  instances, central counterparties receive 
their data about the fi  nancial market trans-
actions to which they are principals from 
trade repositories.Deutsche Bundesbank

Overview of potential risks
Systemic risk
Systemic risk can refer to the inability of in-
dividual system participants to meet their 
contractual obligations, thereby resulting, in turn, in other system participants being 
unable to meet their obligations when due (domino effect). Such a chain reaction could mean that many or even all of the transac-tions in a system cannot be settled properly. This can, in turn, have severe adverse  effects 
on fi  nancial markets and the economy. 
However, systemic risk may also be due to 
infrastructures being linked to one another. 
If, for example, a securities settlement sys-
tem is linked to a payment system for the 
booking of cash fl  ows, a disruption in one 
system can disrupt the other and vice versa. 
FMIs are unavoidably exposed to systemic risk, but they should be set up in such a 
way that this risk is reduced.
Legal risk
Legal risk is the risk of the unexpected ap-
plication of a law or regulation, meaning, 
for example, that individual contractual conditions could become illegal or unen-forceable. This applies in particular to 
cross-border contexts, where different bod-ies of law can apply to a single transaction, activity or market participant.
Credit riskCredit risk is the risk that a counterparty will 
be unable to meet its fi  nancial obligations 
when due, or at any time in the future. 
Credit risks can have various sources and 
appearances. A credit risk in the narrower 
sense exists if short-term loans are granted by the infrastructures themselves or among the participants in order to assist a smooth payment settlement. Settlement risk is the 
risk that, when settling transactions against 
payment, one party meets its contractual 
obligation but the other does not. This risk 
is generally eliminated by settling transac-tions on a payment-versus-payment (PVP) 
basis. Replacement risk is the risk that one 
counterparty is unable to meet its payment 
obligation and the other is then unable to 
deliver on its end of the originally envisaged 
PVP settlement. Both parties (or possibly a 
central counterparty that has entered into a 
bilateral transaction) are then exposed to risk of loss because they must replace the original transaction at a less favourable 
market price.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk of a counterparty 
being unable to meet its fi  nancial obliga-tions as and when expected, although it 
may be able to do so in full in the future. In 
the case of a securities transaction, for 
 example, both the buyer and the seller can 
be exposed to this risk, albeit in different 
ways. For the buyer, liquidity risk is the risk that it will not receive the purchased secur-ities when due and will have to borrow the 
securities on the market in order to com-
plete its own delivery obligations. If a seller does not receive the agreed payment when due, it may have to acquire funds by other 
means in order to fully meet its payment obligations. Liquidity problems have the 
 potential to create systemic problems, par-
ticularly if they occur when markets are 
tight or illiquid, or if they create concerns 
about a counterparty’s solvency.Deutsche Bundesbank

potential in those markets based on quickly 
available and accurate data. These measures 
are intended to help enhance transparency, re -
duce systemic risk and prevent market abuse. 
On behalf of the G20 the Financial Stability 
Board (FSB)3 is monitoring the implementation 
of the agreed measures by soliciting semi-annual 
progress reports.
The principles are applicable to all systemically 
important FMIs. When they were being formu -
lated, considerable attention was paid to the 
differences between the various types of FMIs 
with regard to organisation, functions and de -
sign; moreover, not all principles can be applied 
to all types of FMI. In addition, they are flexible 
in that they can be observed in different ways 
and by different means. The individual prin -
ciples follow on from one another logically and 
are mutually complementary. They represent 
minimum requirements which may be ex -
ceeded both by the FMIs and by their national 
supervisors. In some cases, the principles also mention best practices which FMIs may add -
itionally use as a guideline should that seem 
appropriate in their particular situation.
The principles apply to FMIs whether they are 
owned by the private sector or by central 
banks. Central banks should ensure that the 
systems they operate comply with the prin -
ciples in order to remain competitively neutral. 
On the other hand, central banks have scope in 
implementing the principles to take their status 
as public authorities and their monetary and li -
quidity policy responsibilities into consider -
ation. Thus, in the Eurosystem, with regard to 
hedging risks arising from the provision of in -
traday credit in the TARGET2 payment system, 
the same collateral framework applies as for Formulation  
of the principlesEqual treatment 
of FMIsGeneral business risk
General business risk comprises all risks 
 related to the business operations of a  fi  nancial market infrastructure, excluding those related to the default of a counter-
party. For example, changes in the market 
or competition can result in reductions in 
earnings or increased costs and thus jeop-
ardise an infrastructure’s continued exist-
ence.
Custody and investment riskCustody risk is the risk of loss on assets held 
in custody in the event of a custodian’s in-
solvency, negligence, fraud, poor adminis-tration or inadequate recordkeeping. By contrast, investment risk is the risk of loss faced by a fi  nancial market infrastructure 
when it invests its own resources or those 
of its participants. Both risks can result in credit and liquidity bottlenecks as well as 
damage to the infrastructure’s reputation.
Operational riskOperational risk is the risk of disruptions to 
daily operations due, for example, to IT sys-
tem errors or failures, human error or 
 external events. These can impair fi  nancial 
market infrastructures’ provision of services 
or even bring operations to a complete standstill. Operational risk can spread and impact on the participants in a fi  nancial market infrastructure or associated infra-
structures and thereby cause systemic risk.

The principles: an overview
The 24 principles can be broken down into 
nine separate categories (see the chart on 
page 39). The core principles are those that are 
designed to facilitate the efficient management 
of the various risks, notably credit and liquidity 
risk. Moreover, arrangements are to be made 
to prevent the default of a participant. The 
principles also deal with questions of transpar -
ency, efficiency and access. In the following, 
those principles which significantly tighten the 
currently applicable rules or introduce new 
rules will be examined. In particular, these in -
clude the accompanying measures for the obli -
gation to have standardised OTC derivative 
contracts cleared via CCPs.
Principles 1 to 3 deal with the general organisa -
tion of FMIs, which, in all of the jurisdictions 
concerned, ought to have a well-founded, 
clear and enforceable legal basis. Their govern -
ance structure should be clear and transparent, 
and ought to promote their safety and effi -
ciency. One new and more stringent rule re -
quires that the public interest and the stability 
of the financial system be supported. A further 
new principle states that FMIs ought to have a 
comprehensive framework for managing all in -
dividual risks.
Principles 4 to 7 lay down requirements with 
regard to managing the credit and liquidity 
risks that both an FMI and participants may 
incur during the settlement process.
Under principle 4, all FMIs are required to iden -
tify, measure, monitor and manage their credit 
risks. In particular, an FMI should maintain suf -
ficient financial resources in the form of equity 
and collateral (eg pledged securities) to cover 
its own exposure to each individual participant 
with a high degree of confidence. In this con -text, the old standards have been tightened 
considerably, as now the entire risk position 
must be covered in full.
A number of special rules apply to CCPs. Be -
cause CCPs act as counterparty towards both 
buyer and seller, theirs is generally speaking a 
matched position. As soon as a participant de -
faults, however, open positions arise, the size 
of which depends not least on market price de -
velopments during the life of a transaction. 
CCPs are expected to fully cover these expos -
ures to each participant using financial re -
sources with at least a 99% level of confidence. 
As a rule, contributions by the participants are 
called for in the form of margins (principle 6). 
Moreover, CCPs should be able to cover the 
default of the largest participant – including its 
affiliates – in the event of extreme (ie with a 
probability of less than 1%) yet plausible mar -
ket price changes. For CCPs that have a par -
ticularly complex risk profile or are systemically 
important for a number of countries, this re -
quirement is extended to include the default of 
the largest two participants (including their af -
filiates). Stress tests and validation of the math -
ematical models deployed should be conducted 
regularly to provide evidence of the appropri -
ateness of the financial resources.
Principle 7 concerns liquidity risk and is de -
signed to ensure that FMIs are able to meet 
their payment obligations punctually in all rele -
vant currencies. The requirements here are 
modelled on the corresponding rules for credit 
risk management; they also take into consider -
ation the default of one or two participants 
and call for similar stress tests. Not only are the 
liquidity risks resulting from a possible default 
of participants to be included, but also the de -
fault of banks which perform special functions 
for the FMI (like the settlement of payments or 
the binding provision of liquidity, if needed). 
Moreover, the principles tighten the require -
ments governing eligible liquid resources and 
now seek to ensure that the liquid resources 
are readily available and reliably prearranged.General

Principles 8 to 10 address reconciling payment 
and delivery obligations. FMIs should ensure 
clear and certain settlement finality by the end 
of the business day at the latest. Where prac -
tical and available, money settlement should be 
conducted in safe central bank money; other -
wise, the credit and liquidity risks stemming 
from settlement in commercial bank money 
have to be controlled. The risks associated with 
obligations to deliver physical instruments or 
commodities, such as counterfeits, should be 
monitored and controlled.
Principles 11 and 12 address CSDs and 
exchange-of-value settlement systems. CSDs 
depositories are expected to facilitate elec -
tronic securities bookings by immobilising se -
curities or dematerialising securities. Exchange-
of-value settlement systems are used to settle 
two linked performance obligations, for ex -
ample the delivery of securities against pay -
ment. When settling transactions of this kind, 
FMIs should eliminate the principal risk by con -ditioning the final settlement of one obligation 
upon the final settlement of the other.
An FMI should have effective and clearly de -
fined rules and procedures to manage a par -
ticipant‘s default (principle 13). These rules and 
procedures should be designed to ensure that 
the FMI can take timely action to contain losses 
and liquidity pressures and continue to meet its 
obligations. The new principle 14 addresses 
CCPs only and reflects the need to protect in -
direct clearing participants given the manda -
tory centralised clearing for OTC derivatives. 
Since the high access requirements for CCPs in 
many cases make direct participation econom -
ically unattractive, many market participants 
use another (direct) clearing participant through 
which they hold their trading positions and the 
collateral to be posted in respect of the market 
risk. For this reason, the principle provides that 
the positions and collateral of the indirect par -
ticipant should be segregated legally and ef -
fectively from those of the direct clearing par -Settlement

ticipant. In the event of a direct clearing par -
ticipant’s insolvency, this ensures the portability 
of the positions and collateral to another direct 
clearing participant.
Principles 15 to 17 concern general business 
and operational risks. FMIs are to manage their 
general business risks, which may take the 
form, for example, of falling demand when 
major clients are lost or as a result of general 
market developments. Moreover, they should 
have sufficient equity and liquid funds so that 
they can continue providing services as a going 
concern even under such circumstances. This 
new principle was added because FMIs have 
no or very few competitors, meaning they can -
not be readily replaced. Furthermore, FMIs 
should invest their own assets and the assets 
they hold for their participants safely and in a 
way that assures high availability and access in 
order to mitigate custody and investment risks. 
In future, more stringent requirements will 
apply to operational risk management as well. 
Potential internal and external sources of oper -
ational risk are to be identified and their impact 
mitigated through the use of appropriate sys -
tems, policies, procedures and controls. The 
design of the technical systems should ensure a 
high degree of security and operational reliabil -
ity and allow scalable capacity. It should be 
possible to resume operations in a timely fash -
ion in the event of major disruptions.
Principles 18 to 20 address, in the broadest 
sense, access to FMIs. Principle 18 sets forth 
objective, risk-based and transparent participa -
tion requirements. Under principle 19, which is 
new, risks that may potentially result from a 
tiered participation structure with direct and in -
direct participants are likewise to be managed. 
Principle 20 concerns links between FMIs.
These three principles are important, too, in 
light of the mandatory centralised clearing for 
standardised OTC derivatives and the increas -
ing trend towards globally operating FMIs. 
Many countries do not have CCPs for their own 
domestic market nor any plans to establish in -frastructures of this kind as they would not be 
economically viable. In such cases, non-
discriminatory direct access to foreign CCPs, 
and therefore the definition of the participation 
criteria, are essential. Sometimes, a direct link 
between CCPs can facilitate this access. In such 
a case, two trading partners in two different 
countries can use the services of their domestic 
FMIs without having to join a foreign FMI as a 
direct participant. Here, the FMIs assume an 
intermediary function. Principle 20 focuses on 
managing the risks that such links entail and 
preventing potential spillover.4
Principles 21 and 22 lay down standards for ef -
ficient business operations. FMIs should be ef -
fective and efficient in meeting the require -
ments of their participants and the markets 
they serve. In particular, they should use or ac -
commodate internationally accepted proced -
ures and standards of communication.
The objective of principles 23 and 24 is to im -
prove transparency. FMIs are expected to dis -
close all relevant rules and important proced -
ures, and enable their participants to precisely 
evaluate their participation-related risks and 
costs.
Principle 24 is new and addresses solely TRs, 
which are to make timely and accurate data 
available to supervisory authorities, central 
banks and the public. However, the level of de -
tail of the information provided must reflect 
the confidential nature of trading partners’ 
business data. A joint CPSS-IOSCO working 
group is currently examining the question as to 
what data, and to what degree of aggregation, 
individual supervisors such as banking super -
visors or central banks with a macroprudential 
mandate should have access. The general min -

fied in greater detail.5
Responsibilities of  
central banks, market 
 regulators and other  
relevant authorities
To ensure that all FMIs implement the new 
principles with maximum consistency, the prin -
ciples contain five so-called responsibilities (A 
to E). These take into consideration the fact 
that the comprehensive implementation of the 
principles can only be assured by effective 
regulation, supervision and oversight by the 
relevant authorities. Thus, they address central 
banks, market regulators and other relevant 
authorities. These new rules represent a further 
step in the standards which previously applied 
only to systemically important payment sys -
tems.
Under responsibility A, central banks, market 
regulators and other relevant authorities should 
ensure appropriate and effective regulation, 
supervision and oversight of FMIs. They are ex -
pected to base their decision regarding the 
FMIs to be regulated, supervised or overseen 
on clear and publicly disclosed criteria. Respon -
sibility A recognises that the distribution of 
powers between central banks, market regula -
tors and other relevant authorities may differ 
according to the applicable national legislation.
According to responsibility B, the authorities 
charged with the regulation, supervision or 
oversight of FMIs should have sufficient powers 
and resources. These include the power to ob -
tain in a timely manner the information needed 
to assess the FMIs and the authority to induce 
change or enforce corrective measures, if ne -
cessary, as well as to receive the requisite ma -
terial and personnel resources.
Responsibility C states that central banks, mar -
ket regulators and other relevant authorities 
charged with the regulation, supervision or oversight of FMIs should clearly define and dis -
close their policies with regard to the objectives 
and instruments their activities entail. This pub -
lic disclosure of their activities makes it clear to 
the FMIs what requirements they have to meet.
Responsibility D requires the central banks, 
market regulators and other relevant author -
ities charged with the regulation, supervision or 
oversight of FMIs to adopt and apply the prin -
ciples consistently. The requirements of the 
principles have been worded in the most gen -
eral language possible so that the substance of 
the principles can be applied consistently in all 
the countries and for all the FMIs concerned. 
Above all, this is necessary in the global context 
in order to maintain a level playing field for the 
various FMIs.
Under responsibility E, the central banks, mar -
ket regulators and other relevant authorities 
charged with the regulation, supervision or 
oversight of FMIs should cooperate with each 
other domestically and internationally to pro -
mote the safety and efficiency of FMIs and to 
support each other in performing their tasks. 
Such cooperation is called for in normal cir -
cumstances and in crisis situations as well as 
during the potential recovery or resolution of 
an FMI. The responsibilities allow for a certain 
degree of flexibility in the form cooperation 
may take. For instance, if international cooper -
ation is deemed appropriate, the FMI’s home 
supervisor can assume a coordinating role. 
Where FMIs settle transactions in several cur -
rencies, the respective issuing central banks’ 
views should be considered. Furthermore, the 
principles explicitly state that the envisaged co -
operation does not in any way prejudice the 
duties and responsibilities assigned to an au -
thority as part of its statutory mandate.Guidance for

Application of the principles
Central banks, market regulators and other 
relevant authorities have until the end of 2012 
to integrate the principles into their legal and 
regulatory framework. The FMIs are expected 
to apply the principles as soon as possible.
To ensure the consistent implementation of the 
principles when assessing FMIs, the CPSS and 
IOSCO have, in addition, developed an assess -
ment methodology. It comprises the 24 prin -
ciples, which are aimed at the FMIs, and the 
five responsibilities of central banks, market 
regulators and other relevant authorities. This 
methodology takes the form of an extensive 
questionnaire and is designed to evaluate indi -
vidual aspects. It can be used by FMIs to con -
duct a self-assessment or by national supervis -
ory authorities to assess FMIs. It is left to the 
supervisory authorities’ discretion whether they 
use the methodology as written or develop an 
in-depth methodology of their own.
The methodology also encourages international 
organisations such as the World Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) to apply the 
principles when assessing the stability of a 
country’s financial sector (Financial Sector As -
sessment Program).
In addition to the principles, the CPSS and 
IOSCO have devised a framework along the 
lines of the principle of transparency, which is 
intended to promote the rigorous disclosure of 
information by FMIs themselves. FMIs are to 
present an explanatory, continuous text con -
taining a coherent and lucid account of the as -
pects dealt with in the principles. Thus, this 
framework offers participants, central banks, 
supervisory authorities and the public greater 
insight into the organisation and functioning of 
an individual FMI, and makes it possible to 
compare FMIs of the same type.
Although the principles aim to ensure the sta -
bility of the relevant FMIs, the possibility of an 
FMI experiencing distress cannot be eliminated with certainty. For this reason, in the same way 
as for financial institutions, thought is being 
given to putting robust recovery and resolution 
regimes for FMIs into place so that they can 
perform their main functions even in the event 
of a crisis. To address this point in particular, in 
a few weeks’ time the CPSS and IOSCO will 
present the core elements of restructuring and 
resolution regimes for FMIs for public consult -
ation.
Implementation  
in Europe and the role  
of the Bundesbank
As part of its statutory mandate and as an inte -
gral part of the Eurosystem, the Bundesbank 
contributes to the stability of payment and 
settlement systems. The Bank fulfils this man -
date by, among other things, engaging in over -
sight activities which, in line with the relevant 
European rules, include all FMIs as well as pay -
ment instruments, correspondent banking and 
relevant non-bank service providers.6 A key 
oversight instrument is the assessment of FMIs 
in accordance with the CPSS-IOSCO principles.
Both globalisation and integration within the 
euro area as well as the overall regulatory 
framework in Germany necessitate close co -
operation with other authorities. For instance, 
within the Eurosystem the Bundesbank plays a 
part in the cooperative oversight of the system -
ically important payment systems TARGET2 and 
EURO1. In this context, the Eurosystem-
operated TARGET2 system is subject to the 
same oversight regime as the EURO1 system, 
which is run by large European banks. At the 
international level, the Bundesbank is actively 
involved in the joint oversight of the Continu -
ous Linked Settlement System, which handles 
the majority of global foreign exchange trans -
actions.Assessment

Moreover, the central securities depository 
Clearstream Banking AG and the central coun -
terparty Eurex Clearing AG are of systemic im -
portance to Germany. Because both FMIs have 
a banking licence, the Bundesbank cooperates 
closely with the Federal Financial Supervisory 
Authority (BaFin) to ensure the effective super -
vision and oversight of German FMIs. This co -
operation allows the Bundesbank as overseer 
to call on FMIs to change their behaviour, if ne -
cessary.
Whereas Eurosystem central banks are still dis -
cussing the implementation of the principles at 
systemically important payment systems, fur -
ther progress has been made with legislative 
initiatives regarding their application at CCPs 
and CSDs in Europe.
In the European Union, the G20 agreement on 
the mandatory centralised clearing of OTC de -
rivatives and on improving transparency is to 
be implemented by a legal act, as it has already 
been in many other countries. The Regulation 
of the European Parliament and of the Council 
on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and 
trade repositories (European Market Infrastruc -
ture Regulation, EMIR) will probably be pub -
lished in the Official Journal of the European 
Union in August 2012. The EMIR also reflects 
the requirements set forth in the principles per -
taining to CCPs. In addition, it contains provi -
sions for participation by the central banks as 
overseers and as issuers of the settlement cur -
rencies. The proposal adopted by the Commis -
sion for a Regulation on improving securities 
settlement in the European Union and on cen -
tral securities depositories seeks to establish a 
similar framework for CSDs with regard to 
safety, efficiency and supervision. The Bundes -
bank has been and still is involved in negoti -
ations at Commission and Council level con -
cerning both regulations.Outlook
The implementation of the new principles repre -
sents a significant step forward in further increas -
ing the resilience of the financial infrastructure. 
Not least of all, this is also in the interests of mar -
ket participants. The competent regulatory au -
thorities and the FMIs themselves are currently 
examining the specific effects the new principles 
will have and the potential need for adjustments. 
For FMIs which are both licensed as banks and 
regulated, some of the principles exceed the 
supervisory requirements in respect of credit and 
liquidity risk management. Some of the require -
ments have been tightened considerably, which 
means that additional costs are to be expected. 
What is more, market participants will face 
higher costs because they will have to furnish 
more collateral which, in turn, will become scar -
cer and more expensive. In addition, future bank -
ing supervisory requirements will call for higher 
capital backing for banks’ exposures to CCPs.
The new principles do not necessitate a com -
plete overhaul of the oversight of payment and 
settlement systems. Nevertheless, more com -
plex rules place greater demands on oversight. 
In the last decade, oversight was already evolv -
ing from an initially rather informal, voluntary 
approach to a formal and more strongly 
regulation-driven activity. Henceforth, the Bun -
desbank will have to concern itself much more 
intensively than in the past with extensive mi -
croprudential and macroprudential analyses on 
the FMIs being overseen. Furthermore, given 
the advance of integration within Europe and 
the fact that the structures of many financial 
market segments are already very globally ori -
ented in any case, the requirements set forth in 
international cooperation agreements to which 
the Bundesbank is party are going to rise. This 
applies both to the participation in the over -
sight of foreign FMIs, which the Bundesbank 
wants to see operate safely and efficiently, and 
to the participation by foreign authorities in the 
Bundesbank’s oversight activities, inasmuch as 
the respective FMIs in Germany also become 
systemically important abroad.Implementation
