Economic conditions
Underlying trends
German economic output is likely to have de -
clined considerably more sharply in the second 
quarter of 2020 as a result of the coronavirus 
pandemic than in the first quarter. This looks 
set to be the sharpest decline in real gross do -
mestic product (GDP) since the beginning of 
the quarterly time series published by the Fed -
eral Statistical Office for the period from 1970 
onwards. However, economic activity is likely 
to have already bottomed out in April. The de -
crease in the number of new infections allowed 
for a gradual but substantial easing of the 
measures taken to contain the virus, starting in 
mid- April. Subsequently, the economy began 
to recover.
The economic indicators paint quite a hetero -
geneous picture. Retail sales, in particular, rose 
considerably in May and were even significantly 
higher than at the beginning of the year. Catch- 
up and substitution effects probably also played 
a role here. Nevertheless, economic activity re -
mained well below its pre-  crisis level overall. 
Compared with the previous dramatic slump, 
the recovery in German industrial output was 
relatively moderate, as was the case with goods 
exports. Manufacturing firms were still assess -
ing their current business situation as very poor 
in June, too.1 This also applies to some services 
sectors, such as the hotel and restaurant sector, 
which are still particularly affected by the con -
tainment measures. By contrast, timely, high-  
frequency indicators suggest a relatively rapid 
improvement following the trough in April. The 
Bundesbank’s weekly activity index has risen 
significantly in recent weeks, but was still dis -
tinctly negative in mid-  July.2 The economic re -
covery is expected to continue in the second 
half of the year, with the recently adopted eco -
nomic stimulus package also contributing to 
this.Industry
German industry emerged from the trough of 
the coronavirus crisis in May 2020. Industrial 
output grew by just over one- tenth (+10¼%) 
on the month in seasonally adjusted terms. 
However, it has so far recouped only about 
one- quarter of the losses from the preceding 
slump in March and April. On an average of 
April and May, industrial output was therefore 
still down on the first-  quarter level by almost 
one- quarter (-23¼%). The situation in the dis -
proportionately hard- hit automotive industry, in 
particular, weighed on the overall result, with 
production falling by much more than half. At 
the lowest point of the crisis in April, car manu -
facturers had to bring production to a virtual 
standstill, before slowly resuming activity in 
May. According to data provided by the Ger -
man Association of the Automotive Industry 
(VDA), the numbers of manufactured passen -
ger cars continued to recover in June, but still 
remained below their pre- crisis level from Feb -
ruary by just under one- quarter. Dampened by 
this slump in the automotive sector, the overall 
output of capital goods fell by almost one- third 
(-32%) on the quarter, averaged across April 
and May, which is a far greater decrease than 
in other sectors. Even so, manufacturers of 
intermediate and consumer goods likewise re -
ported very sharp drops in production (-17½% 
and -12½%, respectively).
Demand for German industrial goods experi -
enced a turnaround in May, in step with indus -
trial production. Industrial orders climbed by 
around one- tenth (+10½%) on the month in German eco -

seasonally adjusted terms. However, on an 
average of April and May, they were still down 
on the quarter by just under one- third (-30¾%). 
This decline was broadly based regionally. Ger -
man industrial firms reported that domestic 
orders were down by one- quarter (-24¾%). 
Even fewer new orders were received from the 
euro area and non- euro area countries (-34¼% 
and -35¼%, respectively). Broken down by sec -
tor, the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic 
took a particularly heavy toll on demand for 
capital goods (-37½%). The slump in orders re -
ceived by the automotive sector, which fell by 
around half, had an especially dampening ef -
fect. Equally, though, manufacturers of inter -
mediate and consumer goods also had to cope 
with sharp declines in new orders (-25¼% and 
-10%, respectively). However, evidently there 
were no large- scale cancellations of existing 
orders during the crisis up to that point, which 
had a stabilising effect overall.3 In May, the 
stock of industrial orders was, comparatively 
speaking, moderately lower than the level of 
the last pre- crisis month of February (-2¾%).
Nominal industrial sales also followed the turn -
around in output in May. Compared with the 
previous month, they likewise increased by just 
over one-  tenth (+10¼%). Nevertheless, the 
average of April and May was also down mas -
sively on the previous quarter’s level (-24¾%). 
Broken down by region, sales in Germany de -
clined somewhat less than sales in the euro 
area and non- euro area countries. Looking at 
the sectors individually, there was a particularly 
sharp slump in capital goods sales, driven by 
the temporary standstill in the automotive sec -
tor. Even so, manufacturers of intermediate 
and consumer goods also suffered huge de -
clines in sales. In line with this, nominal exports 
of goods increased considerably in May by a 
seasonally adjusted 9% on the month. By con -
trast, averaged across April and May, they were 
just over one- quarter lower than the average of 
the first three months of the year in nominal 
and price- adjusted terms. Against the backdrop Industrial sales 
and exports of

of the global spread of coronavirus, this slump 
was very broadly based. However, business 
with China bucked this general trend, contract -
ing only marginally in value. This is probably 
due to the fact that the Chinese economy 
emerged from the trough of the pandemic-  
induced recession earlier than most other trad -
ing partners. Nominal imports in May saw a 
significant seasonally adjusted rise on the 
month (+3½%). By contrast, as an average of 
April and May, these figures fell massively short 
of the previous quarter’s level (-18½%). Even 
so, the very substantial increase in imports from 
China had a stabilising effect here, too. Deliver -
ies of medical protective equipment and catch- 
up effects following the strict containment 
measures in February, which had led to a par -
tial standstill in Chinese production, probably 
played a role in this. After adjustment for price 
effects, the decline in imports was somewhat 
smaller overall (-14¾%). This discrepancy was 
related to the continued drop in energy prices 
in the period under review.
Construction
The German construction industry has so far 
proved to be exceptionally robust in the face of 
the coronavirus crisis. Seasonally adjusted con -
struction output grew somewhat in May 2020 
compared with the previous month (+½%). On 
an average of April and May, it was significantly 
down on the first quarter (-4¾%), but con -
struction output during the winter months was 
greatly bolstered by the mild weather condi -
tions. Therefore, a decline in the second quar -
ter would have been expected, even without 
pandemic- induced effects. In April and May, 
the quarter- on- quarter drop in activity in the 
main construction sector (-2%) was signifi -
cantly smaller than that in the finishing trades 
(-7%). By contrast, more effects of the corona -
virus crisis could be felt in new orders in the 
main construction sector. In April and May 
– the most recent months for which statistics 
are available  – incoming orders were down 
sharply on the previous quarter after seasonal adjustment (-9½%). This was largely due to the 
decrease in new orders in commercial building 
construction, as well as in housing construc -
tion, which is dependent on consumers’ labour 
market and income prospects. By contrast, a 
small number of large orders in the area of 
public civil engineering work and road con -
struction had a stabilising effect. In addition, 
the overall decline was from a very high level, 
following the exceptionally strong and broad-  
based inflow of orders in the fourth quarter of 
2019 and first quarter of 2020. In view of this, 
construction firms’ order books are likely to still 
be well filled. According to surveys by the ifo 
Institute, equipment utilisation in the main con -
struction industry remained well above its long- 
term average.
Labour market
Although the use of short- time work schemes 
reached unprecedented levels, employment re -
cently fell very significantly and unemployment 
rose markedly. Between March and May 2020, 
notifications of short- time work had been filed 
for more than 11 million employees subject to 
social security contributions. In June, however, 
notifications were filed for just 342,000 add -
itional persons. According to initial assessments 
by the Federal Employment Agency, the scheme 
was used by 6.8 million persons in April. This 
equated to one in five employees subject to 
social  security contributions being in short- time 
work. On average, short- time workers worked 
half of their regular working hours. In May, the 
number of short-  time workers may have risen 
slightly, but it is likely to have thus reached its 
maximum level.
As in April, employment declined very signifi -
cantly in May. The number of persons in work 
in Germany fell by 314,000, or 0.7%, on the 
month in seasonally adjusted terms. In addition 
to the steep drop in exclusively low-  paid part-  
time employment in April, the number of jobs 
subject to social security contributions also 
shrank considerably. All sectors were affected, Construction

with the exception of public administration, 
banking and insurance services and agriculture. 
The decline in the hotel and restaurant sector 
and in temporary agency employment was par -
ticularly steep.
The number of persons officially registered as 
unemployed rose much less sharply in June 
than in the previous two months. The increase 
in June amounted to just 69,000 persons on 
the month in seasonally adjusted terms. This 
brought the number of unemployed persons to 
2.94 million; the unemployment rate grew by 
0.1 percentage point to 6.4%. In March, it had 
still been 5.0%. Other indicators likewise point 
to fewer adjustment requirements in the com -
ing months. Recruitment indicators are recover -
ing from their record lows. While the number 
of existing vacancies still declined somewhat, 
the number of new vacancies improved again 
significantly.
Prices
In June 2020, crude oil prices continued to 
recover  owing to production cutbacks and a 
marked pick- up in global demand, which was, 
however, still subdued. Prices were up on the 
month by just under one- third, but were still 
around 35% lower on the year. This upward 
trajectory is continuing in July, albeit at a slower 
pace. As this report went to press, the price of 
a barrel of Brent crude oil stood at US$43. 
Crude oil futures were trading at a slight pre -
mium. The premium on crude oil futures was 
US$1¼ for deliveries six months ahead and 
US$2½ for deliveries 12 months ahead.
Import prices picked up again somewhat in 
May owing to higher energy prices. By con -
trast, there was little change in the prices of 
other imports. In industrial domestic sales, for 
which data up to June are already available, 
prices went down further on an average of the 
two months. Energy prices, in particular, fell 
significantly. Excluding energy, the decline was 
smaller. Much like in April, import prices and industrial producer prices recently fell short of 
the prior- year level, by 7% and around 2%, re -
spectively.
Having been declining since March, consumer 
prices as measured by the Harmonised Index of 
Consumer Prices (HICP) rose again significantly 
in June after seasonal adjustment.4 This was 
mainly on account of the renewed rise in en -
ergy prices. Food prices were higher, largely 
due to tobacco. Prices for services were also 
distinctly higher. By contrast, consumers had to 
pay the same amounts as in the previous 
month for non- energy industrial goods. Annual 
headline HICP inflation rose overall from 0.5% 
to 0.8%.5 The core rate, which strips out en -
ergy and food, remained at 1.1%. Owing to the 
temporary lowering of value added tax in the 
second half of 2020, negative inflation rates 
are likely from July onwards, although the im -
pact on consumer prices is likely to be delayed 
in some cases and, in some areas, the reduc -
tion will probably not be passed on to con -
sumers in full. Nevertheless, when the cut in 
VAT rates is rescinded in January 2021, the rates 
should become clearly positive again. As things 
currently stand, very high inflation rates are 
even likely from the second half of 2021 on -Rise in

Public finances7
Local government finances
In the first quarter of 2020, the deficit of local 
government (core and off- budget entities) 
doubled on the year to €10 billion. In many 
cases, reserves were released. However, debt 
also increased by a total of €1½ billion com -
pared with the end of 2019, reaching €137 bil -
lion. Cash advances rose significantly (+€3 bil -
lion to €38 billion), whilst other debt decreased.
Revenue was significantly weaker in the first 
quarter than previously. The impact of the 
coronavirus pandemic and the measures taken 
in connection with it was still limited at this 
time. Nevertheless, tax revenue fell by 5%. 
Transfers from state government all but offset 
this decline, though, with total revenue dipping 
only slightly as a result. Expenditure rose sharply, 
by just over 7% (€4½ billion). Personnel costs 
and other operating expenditure recorded re -
newed dynamic growth. In addition, spending 
on fixed asset formation was again stepped up 
significantly (19%). By contrast, expenditure on 
social benefits declined slightly, primarily due to 
the continued decrease in accommodation 
costs for persons in receipt of unemployment 
benefit II. This means that there were still no 
signs of pandemic- related expenditure pres -
sures at this point in time.
The pandemic will have a strong impact on 
local government budgets in the year as a 
whole. On the revenue side, local business tax 
will be particularly affected. On the expend -
iture side, the costs of accommodation for re -
cipients of the basic allowance could be one 
particular spending item to increase markedly. 
It is still difficult to put a number on the costs 
attributable to the crisis, but it seems certain 
that they will be considerable. Moreover, there 
is currently no evidence to indicate that local government finances will rapidly recover on 
their own.Sharp increase

6 If the VAT cut were passed on to consumers immediately 
and in full, annual headline HICP inflation would be 
1.8 percentage points lower between July and December 
2020. With the renewed rise in tax rates from January 
2021, the HICP rate would initially increase by 1.8 percent -
age points until June, meaning that the dampening VAT 
effect would be eliminated again. From July 2021 until the 
end of 2021, a base effect would then come into play, 
which would push the inflation rate up – in purely mechan -
ical terms – by another 1.8 percentage points. Based on 
the June projection, in which an inflation rate of 1½% was 
expected, the HICP rate could therefore climb to just over 
3% in the second half of 2021 – looking at the VAT effect 
in purely mechanical terms – until the base effect is elimin -
ated in January 2022. In fact, the VAT reduction is likely to 
be passed on to consumers with a time lag and will prob -
ably not be passed on to them in full, meaning that the 
tax- related temporary volatility in the inflation rate should 
be lower than if viewed from a purely mechanical perspec -
tive.

Reform of local government fi  nances: making fi  nancing 
crisis- proof and stable
The fi  nancial situation of many local gov-
ernments is in critical condition as a result 
of the pandemic, and short- term support 
from central and state governments is ne-
cessary. The problems seen during the crisis 
show once again that local government fi  -
nancing is in need of reform. There is much 
to be said for making a fresh attempt at re-
form so as to increase the fi  nancial resili-
ence of local governments. While this is 
quite complex, and there is political resist-
ance from many quarters – also at the local 
government level – it is precisely at this level 
that having a stable and reliable budgetary 
policy would be desirable, not least in order 
to stabilise investment. Having to repeat-
edly adopt ad hoc emergency measures, 
sometimes following lengthy negotiations, 
appears rather ineffi   cient.
A key problem is the high degree of local 
government dependence on the highly 
volatile local business tax. And it is this tax 
for which the shortfalls are currently ex-
pected to be the largest. Local business tax 
also makes corporate taxation much more 
complex, with a different assessment basis 
to those of income and corporation tax. For 
example, interest, rents and licence fees 
(i.e. costs) are also taxed to some extent to 
provide a certain degree of stability. How-
ever, this can result in an excessive tax bur-
den relative to any profi  t. This can exacer-
bate crises for enterprises. Moreover, Ger-
many in particular is pushing for a common 
corporate tax base in Europe, and this is 
also made more diffi   cult by the particular 
nature of the country’s local business tax.A previous fundamental reform 
proposal 
One obvious starting point for a fundamen-
tal reform of local government fi  nances 
would be to abolish local business tax al-
together. It could be replaced by a local 
government surcharge (with a locally set 
multiplier) on corporation and income tax. 
This would simplify corporate taxation con-
siderably. The last time such a reform was 
seriously examined was in 2011 by the local 
government fi  nance commission, acting on 
a proposal from the then Federal Govern-
ment. This reform was known as the “test 
model” (Prüfmodell). As a stabilising elem-
ent, local governments were to be given a 
greater share of turnover tax revenue.1 
Under this approach, tax revenue would be 
distributed less according to where busi-
nesses are registered and more in line with 
population distribution. The proposal ultim-
ately failed due to political resistance, and 
such resistance is still to be expected.
A modifi  ed approach
However, other approaches could conceiv-
ably deliver signifi  cant improvements. For 
example, local business tax could be main-
tained whilst abolishing the peculiarities of 
its assessment basis. Aligning the assess-
ment bases of corporate taxes in this way 
would simplify the taxation procedure. 
Moreover, it would make it easier to estab-
lish a common corporate tax base at the 
European level. In such a case, local govern-
ments would retain local business tax with 
a locally set multiplier. Through this modi-
fi  ed local business tax, local enterprises

would continue to bear the costs of the in-
frastructure they use.
However, without any asset- taxing elem-
ents, revenue from local business tax would 
fl  uctuate even more sharply than before. In 
order to stabilise local government fi  nan-
cing, it would therefore be necessary to sig-
nifi  cantly reduce the weight of local busi-
ness tax and introduce revenue- stabilising 
elements. It is possible for this rebalancing 
to be structured in such a way that general 
government revenue and its distribution be-
tween central, state and local government 
ultimately remain largely unchanged. If de-
sired, the burden on enterprises can also be 
largely maintained by combining a lower 
local business tax with higher corporation 
tax.2
In order to stabilise revenue, a second com-
ponent could see local governments receive 
a greater share of wage tax revenue than 
before.3 As in the case of the part of local 
business tax that would cease to apply, the 
link to economic power could be estab-
lished here. Each local government would 
receive an amount refl  ecting the share in 
the national wage bill attributable to the lo-
cally employed labour force (“business loca-
tion” principle). This reform element would 
not change the burden on employees or 
enterprises. Available wage tax revenue 
would merely be distributed differently do-
mestically.
As a possible third component, the revenue 
autonomy of local governments could be 
strengthened through general income tax-
ation. To this end, local governments’ exist-
ing residence- linked share could be supple-
mented by giving each municipality the 
power to set its own local multiplier. This 
could be based on the local government 
share of income tax,4 and there are already 
provisions for this in Article 106(5) of Ger-many’s Basic Law (Grundgesetz). Together 
with real property tax, this would provide a 
clearer link between the funding of local 
government services and the population of 
a given municipality.
Limiting volatility in local government 
fi  nancial equalisation schemes
The changes described above would in-
crease the ability of individual local govern-
ments to collect revenue in line with their 
needs. At the same time, revenue fl  uctu-
ations would be limited. However, fl  uctu-
ations in local government fi  nancial equal-
isation schemes should also be reduced. 
Where these schemes are set up to provide 
local governments with fi  xed shares of state 
government tax revenue, state government 
transfers to local governments will plummet 
next year unless ad hoc countermeasures 
are taken. Such a volatile development 
could be avoided if, besides local demo-
graphic trends, state government alloca-
tions were no longer linked to the tax rev-
enue of the federal states but, say, to the 
smoother growth trend of the economy as 
a whole. In addition, the allocations could 
include more needs- based elements.
2 A balance could also be struck between local gov-
ernments, possibly involving the local government fi  -
nancial equalisation schemes. Modifying revenue 
shares or tax burdens – for enterprises, for example – 
is also a conceivable option. This is not discussed in 
this box, however.
3 The three components mentioned here are based on 
the four- pillar model; see Market Economy Foundation 
(2020). Another pillar is real property tax, which is al-
ready being reformed following a ruling of the Federal 
Constitutional Court in 2018.
4 In principle, the local government share of income 
tax is distributed among local governments according 
to the proceeds collected within their respective 
boundaries. However, income is only taken into ac-
count up to an upper limit. This limit is currently a tax-
able income of €40,000 for individuals and €80,000 
for couples who are assessed jointly for tax purposes. 
If such a limit is maintained, it would be logical to 
apply the local multiplier only up to this limit. This 
would mean that the differences in fi  nancial capacity 
between local governments would be of only limited 
consequence.Deutsche Bundesbank

Local governments are not as well placed as 
central government and state governments to 
cope with sharp economic downturns in their 
budgets because it is not as easy for them to 
take out loans. Central and state governments 
are therefore planning to make support pay -
ments to local governments this year. For ex -
ample, they intend to compensate for the ex -
pected €12 billion shortfall in local business tax 
for 2020 included in the tax estimate (com -
pared with the figure estimated in autumn 
2019). Each federal state will then distribute 
the funds to its local governments. In addition, 
it is envisaged that central government will per -
manently assume a significantly larger share of the costs of accommodation for those in re -
ceipt of unemployment benefit II. The share as -
sumed by local governments is to fall from 
slightly more than half to just over one- quarter. 
This should lighten the load on local govern -
ment budgets by a further €3½ billion this year. 
The various assistance measures put in place 
could, by and large, offset the crisis- related 
strain on local government budgets this year. 
Modernisation and expansion of local govern -
ment infrastructure can thus continue for the 
time being, which should provide support – 
not least to the local economy.
However, local governments will be faced with 
new budgetary problems next year already. Ac -
cording to the May tax estimate, the revenue 
shortfalls will have a much greater impact in 
the medium term, too, than the planned relief 
in the area of accommodation costs. In add -
ition, local governments will be affected by 
new tax cuts for a number of years – first and 
foremost by the temporary expansion of depre -
ciation options. Lastly, regular transfers from 
state government are at risk of shrinking signifi -
cantly. Most federal states finance their local 
government financial equalisation schemes by 
means of fixed shares in their tax revenue. The 
tax estimate includes significant downward re -
visions for these, too. In the absence of further 
adjustments, this would put pressure on local 
governments with a time lag from 2021 on -
wards. However, some federal states have al -
ready announced plans to provide additional 
support to their local governments. The crisis 
once again reveals the need for a reform of 
local government financing (see the box on 
pp. 10 f.).
Statutory health  
insurance scheme
In the first quarter of 2020, the statutory health 
insurance (SHI) scheme (comprising the health 
insurance institutions and the health fund)

ure. The sharp rise in spending by the health 
insurance institutions was the main reason for 
the increase in the deficit. Expenditure on 
pharmaceuticals was particularly high, rising by 
11½%. Given the uncertainty surrounding the 
pandemic, it appears that prescriptions were 
filled ahead of time. Moreover, the initial ef -
fects of the pandemic could be seen in the 
health fund’s revenue, which appears to have 
already been curbed markedly back in March.
The health fund was originally expected to re -
cord a deficit of €2 billion for the year as a 
whole and to draw on reserves accordingly. 
This was intended for transfers to the innov -
ation and structural funds as well as a lowering 
of contributions for occupational pensions. The 
economic slump caused by the pandemic now 
implies a significantly higher deficit. However, 
revenue shortfalls will be limited by the fact 
that contributions are still levied when short-  
time working or unemployment benefits are 
drawn. On the expenditure side, the health 
fund will come under particular pressure due to 
having to make a number of compensation 
payments and expand testing in connection 
with the pandemic. In order to support the 
health fund, central government plans to pro -
vide an additional grant of €3½ billion for the 
current year on top of liquidity loans running 
less than one year. This is likely to only partially 
offset the fund’s additional costs this year, 
however.
Last autumn, the group of estimators had pre -
dicted a rise of 4½% in spending by health in -
surance institutions for the year as a whole. 
Assuming an unchanged supplementary contri -
bution rate –  which has been the case to 
date – calculations at the time put the institu -
tions’ deficit at €1½ billion. However, the fact 
that hospitals are postponing procedures as far 
as possible in order to keep sufficient beds free 
for COVID-  19 patients is now affording relief. In 
addition, there may be lower demand for other 
services provided by health insurance institu -
tions during 2020 as a whole owing to con -
cerns about possible infection. However, the negative result that the health insurance fund is 
expected to post is likely to be a major factor in 
the SHI scheme closing the year as a whole 
with a significantly higher deficit than in the 
previous year.
Financial pressure is set to increase next year, 
especially among the health insurance institu -
tions. Transfers from the health fund will con -
tinue to be significantly subdued by the crisis: 
these will be determined in autumn, primarily 
on the basis of the estimated employment and 
wages for 2021. Moreover, there will presum -
ably be a period of catch- up with respect to 
procedures that had previously been post -
poned. In addition, a vaccine against the novel 
coronavirus is expected to be available next 
year. Purchasing vaccine doses will then entail 
additional expenditure. The Federal Govern -
ment wishes to prevent economic growth from 
being hindered by sharply rising social contri -
bution rates. To this end, the agreements on 
the economic stimulus package also contain 
arrangements for central government assis -
tance to be provided next year, if necessary.
Public long- term care 
insurance  scheme
The core area8 of the public long- term care in -
surance scheme recorded a small surplus in the 
first quarter of 2020. This was somewhat lower 
than it was a year ago. Revenue as a whole still 
increased significantly, by 5%: this was due to 
the raising of the contribution rate from the 
start of 2019, which was not yet in full effect 
for pension recipients in the same quarter of 
the previous year. At just over 6½%, expend -
iture growth was slightly stronger. While spend -
ing on full inpatient care, a particularly large 
expenditure item, continued to stagnate, other Health fund def -

non- cash and cash benefits increased very 
sharply.
Contribution shortfalls as a result of the pan -
demic will be observed as the year progresses. 
As with the SHI scheme, these will be damp -
ened, but not fully offset, by contributions pay -
able on wage substitutes provided by the Fed -
eral Employment Agency. On the expenditure 
side, additional non- cash benefits in connec -
tion with the pandemic as well as premiums for 
care staff are on the horizon. In its second sup -
plementary budget, the Federal Government is 
planning transfers of €2 billion for the long-  
term care insurance scheme in order to com -pensate for the costs stemming from the crisis. 
With these funds, it appears possible for the 
long- term care insurance scheme to close the 
current year with a surplus, albeit a markedly 
smaller one (2019: €3½ billion). Its financial 
situation is likely to massively deteriorate next 
year, when the next regular expansion of long- 
term care benefits will then come on top of 
general growth in expenditure. As things cur -
rently stand, it seems likely that there will be a 
limited deficit overall that can be covered by 
the relatively high general reserves.
Securities markets
Bond market
At €172.8 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in May 2020 was down slightly 
on the previous month (€176.8 billion). After 
deducting the lower redemptions and taking 
account of changes in issuers’ holdings of their 
own debt securities, net issuance of domestic 
debt securities came to €78.6 billion. The out -
standing volume of foreign debt securities in 
Germany rose by €0.3 billion during the report -
ing month, boosting the outstanding volume 
of debt instruments in the German market by 
€79.0 billion overall.
The reporting month saw the public sector 
issue a record €64.2 billion net in debt secur -
ities, up from €12.8 billion in April, as the 
coronavirus assistance measures and action to 
support the economy sent public sector bor -
rowing significantly higher. Central government 
was the main issuer of new securities (€55.2 
billion), chiefly in the form of Treasury discount 
paper (Bubills: €24.9 billion) and ten- year Fed -
eral bonds (Bunds: €11.3 billion). It also issued 
the new seven- year and 15- year Federal bonds 
for the first time (totalling €3.4 billion and €6.6 
billion, respectively). State and local govern -
ments issued bonds worth €9.0 billion net.

compared with €16.0 billion one month earlier, 
with non- financial corporations accounting for 
the bulk of this issuance, on balance.
Domestic credit institutions reduced their cap -
ital market debt by €2.4 billion net in May, fol -
lowing net issuance of €2.4 billion in April. De -
clines were mainly seen in the outstanding vol -
ume of mortgage Pfandbriefe (€3.5 billion), of 
other bank debt securities that can be struc -
tured flexibly (€2.0 billion) and of public Pfand -
briefe  (€1.7 billion). Only debt securities issued 
by specialised credit institutions, a category 
which includes public promotional banks, saw 
net issuance (of €4.8 billion net).
The main buyers of bonds in May were non-  
resident investors (€38.3 billion), while the 
Bundesbank acquired bonds in the net amount 
of €35.2 billion, for the most part under the 
Eurosystem’s asset purchase programmes. Resi -
dent credit institutions purchased bonds worth 
€9.7 billion on balance, focusing their attention 
primarily on domestic securities. Domestic non- 
banks, by contrast, scaled back their bond 
portfolios by €4.2 billion net; here, too, the 
focus was on German paper.
Equity market
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
placed new shares worth €1.4 billion net in the 
German equity market. The volume of foreign 
equities in the German market rose by €5.7 bil -
lion over the same period. On balance, shares 
were purchased chiefly by domestic non- banks 
(€8.7 billion), but domestic credit institutions 
were likewise active in the market (€0.4 billion). 
By contrast, foreign investors reduced their 
equity exposure in Germany by €2.0 billion on 
balance.
Mutual funds
In May, German mutual funds recorded muted 
net inflows of €3.4 billion (April: -€1.8 billion). On balance, retail funds were the chief benefi -
ciaries (€2.9 billion). In terms of asset classes, 
new shares were sold mainly by mixed 
securities- based funds (€1.4 billion), whilst 
equity funds and open- end real estate funds 
each acquired inflows totalling €1.1 billion on 
balance. Bond funds, on the other hand, regis -
tered minor outflows of €0.9 billion. The out -
standing volume of foreign mutual fund units 
distributed in Germany rose by €5.9 billion in 
the reporting month. On balance, domestic 
non- banks were virtually the only purchasers of 
mutual fund shares in May (€9.6 billion). The 
bulk of these were foreign securities. Domestic 
credit institutions purchased mutual fund 
shares for €0.1 billion net, while foreign invest -
ors reduced their fund portfolio in Germany by 
€0.5 billion.Fall in credit

Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €6.5 billion in May 2020,9 putting it €2.6 bil -
lion below its level in April. This result was 
driven chiefly by the sharp plunge into a deficit 
for invisible current transactions, which com -
prise services as well as primary and secondary 
income. By contrast, the surplus in the goods 
account saw a more moderate increase over 
the reporting month.
The surplus in the goods account rose by €4.3 
billion on the previous month to €8.5 billion in 
May. Following the slowdown in April as a re -
sult of the coronavirus pandemic, economic ac -
tivity in Germany and many partner countries 
gradually picked up in May. Goods exports and 
imports were both up again, with exports of 
goods recording a noticeably sharper increase 
than imports.
By contrast, the balance of invisible current 
transactions fell steeply by €6.9 billion in May 
and recorded a deficit of €2.0 billion in the re -
porting month. This was primarily because the 
surplus in the primary income account con -
tracted by €8.1 billion to €0.4 billion. The key 
driver here was the increase in dividend pay -
ments on portfolio investments in the area of 
investment income, which is typical for May. In 
the secondary income account, however, the 
deficit narrowed by €0.9 billion to €3.5 billion. 
The receipts side increased more strongly than 
the expenditure side due, in particular, to 
higher general government tax revenue from 
non- residents as a result of increased dividend 
payments on portfolio investment. In the ser -
vices account, the surplus widened slightly by

Deutsche Bundesbank9 Owing to measures taken to contain the coronavirus 
pandemic, public life has been subject to considerable re -
strictions since mid- March 2020. These restrictions have 
not had any noticeable negative impact on the process of 
preparing the balance of payments and thus on the overall 
quality of the results. However, the data sources for the 
“travel” and “income from direct investment” items are 
very limited or subject to greater uncertainty than normal. 
These items could therefore potentially undergo significant

expenditure usually recorded at this time of 
year was virtually absent as a result of the pan -
demic.
In May 2020, international financial markets 
showed recovering prices and volatility de -
clined in response to the fiscal and monetary 
policy measures taken to combat the economic 
fallout of the coronavirus pandemic (SARS-  
CoV- 2). These developments were also re -
flected in Germany’s cross- border portfolio in -
vestment, which recorded net inflows of €23.5 
billion in May (April: net capital exports of 
€26.2 billion). Foreign investors acquired Ger -
man securities worth €35.8 billion net, pur -
chasing – in particular, public – bonds (€28.9 
billion) and money market paper (€9.4 billion). 
These stem from the high level of public sector 
borrowing in the primary market to fund the 
coronavirus assistance measures and the eco -
nomic support package. By contrast, foreign 
investors parted with German shares (€2.0 bil -
lion) and mutual fund shares (€0.5 billion). 
Overall, domestic investors also added secur -
ities issued by non- residents to their portfolio 
(€12.3 billion), favouring shares (€6.1 billion), 
mutual fund shares (€5.9 billion) and – almost 
exclusively euro- denominated  – bonds (€4.0 
billion), but offloaded money market paper 
(€3.7 billion).
Financial derivatives recorded net capital ex -
ports of €5.9 billion in May (April: €13.7 bil -
lion).Direct investment saw net capital exports of 
€8.6 billion in May (following net capital im -
ports of €1.9 billion in April). This was largely 
attributable to the fact that domestic enter -
prises increased their direct investment abroad 
by €11.3 billion, expanding both their equity 
capital (€7.7 billion) as well as their loans to 
branches abroad (€3.6 billion). Foreign enter -
prises also upped their direct investment in 
Germany by €2.7 billion, raising both their 
intra-  group lending (€1.6 billion) as well as 
their equity capital (€1.1 billion).
Other statistically recorded investment – which 
comprises loans and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank de -
posits and other investments – registered net 
outflows amounting to €22.6 billion in May 
(following inflows totalling €25.6 billion in 
April). This was mainly the result of the activ -
ities of enterprises and households, which led 
to capital exports of €26.8 billion. Further cap -
ital outflows were recorded by the Bundesbank 
(€0.8 billion), with non- euro area residents, in 
particular, reducing their deposits with the Bun -
desbank. By contrast, monetary financial insti -
tutions and the general government recorded 
inflows of €3.1 billion and €1.9 billion, respect -
ively.

The German current account surplus 
through the lens of macroeconomic models
For some time now, the German current account surplus has been the subject of intense discus -
sion both at home and abroad. This article presents a number of model- based analyses that look 
at this topic. With regard to the long- term drivers of the German current account balance, it is 
revealed that demographic change in Germany is perceptibly fuelling long- term savings and 
thereby having a positive impact on the current account balance. The labour market reforms 
implemented in Germany in the early 2000s are also likely to have contributed to the rising cur -
rent account balance. However, the recently very large surplus is attributable not only to struc -
tural factors. Macroeconomic models that explain short- term to medium- term deviations from 
long- term structural current account positions attribute the rise to a variety of influencing factors. 
These include increased domestic savings, particularly amongst enterprises. Although the sub -
dued investment activity also played a role, it was less significant in quantitative terms. Further -
more, external factors, including heightened foreign demand for German products, were a key 
factor. Before the 2008 global financial and economic crisis, the surplus was growing mostly in 
trade with euro area countries. Thereafter, growth was driven by demand from countries outside 
Europe.
In addition, policy measures to reduce the current account surplus are examined using simula -
tions featuring multiple macroeconomic models. It is shown that fiscal expansion in Germany 
would reduce the current account surplus. However, most of the models only point towards 
limited effects. While structural reforms in the German services sector would generally also lead 
to a reduction in the current account balance, their impact would be even less pronounced. The 
simulations suggest that changes in the international environment can have a significant impact. 
For example, an appreciation of the euro or an economic downturn in China would have a 
marked dampening effect on the German current account. In light of this, purely national meas -
ures on any plausible scale are unlikely to be sufficient to bring about a distinct reduction in the 
surplus. In order to reduce the surplus by any substantial degree, there would also have to be 
changes in the international environment. In the case of Germany, it is not obvious whether policy 
errors are to blame for the large surplus. For this reason, it is not constructive to introduce tar -
geted measures to reduce the balance.
Nevertheless, fundamentally sensible and appropriate measures could also reduce the surplus. 
Against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic, the Bundesbank’s current forecast estimates 
a considerable decrease in the German current account surplus from more than 7% to less than 
5% of gross domestic product this year. According to the projections, the surplus will not exceed 
the 6% threshold of the EU imbalance procedure again before the end of 2022. Although the 
model scenarios did not simulate the COVID-  19 shock, these projections are generally consistent 
with the model simulations. For example, global economic output weakened significantly as a 
result of the pandemic, international trade collapsed, Chinese economic growth slowed consid -
erably, and German fiscal policy switched to a highly expansionary path in order to tackle the 
fallout of the pandemic.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
For the German economy, current account sur -
pluses are more the rule than the exception. 
One special case was the years following Ger -
man reunification: the current account was in 
deficit and its balance fluctuated around -2% 
of gross domestic product (GDP) over the next 
ten years. This led to net external assets being 
almost completely exhausted. The current ac -
count balance then bounced back into positive 
territory; the surplus subsequently saw strong 
growth. Before the 2008 financial and eco -
nomic crisis, it reached 7%. The global crisis 
interrupted this trend for just a short while. As 
early as 2015, the surplus widened to more 
than 8% and did not come down much until 
the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. This 
led to discussions both at home and abroad. In 
many other countries, there have been signifi -
cant adjustments to current account balances 
over the past two decades. Current account 
imbalances, which had still been under intense 
discussion before the 2008 global financial and 
economic crisis, narrowed considerably (see 
the box on pp. 21-24). However, the German 
current account surplus remained at a high 
level until recently. Furthermore, it is difficult to 
explain on the basis of fundamentals.1
Against this backdrop, the German current ac -
count surplus has been repeatedly criticised by 
organisations such as the IMF and the Euro -
pean Commission, which both called for fiscal 
and economic policy measures to reduce the 
surplus. These included more expansionary fis -
cal policy and structural reforms in the services 
sector.2 In response, the German Federal Gov -
ernment argued that the current account bal -
ance was difficult to control as a variable be -
cause it reflected a range of economic decision- 
making processes at the micro level both in 
Germany and abroad.3 In addition, there were 
no known major policy errors in Germany that 
could have explained the high surpluses. Fi -
nally, there was insufficient evidence for the ef -
ficacy of the proposed measures in reducing 
the surplus.Answers to such questions cannot be found 
solely by describing the development of the 
current account or domestic saving and invest -
ment. However, this is a sensible starting point 
for more in- depth analyses. Ultimately, the driv -
ing forces behind the current account surplus 
and the efficacy of policy measures can only be 
identified and analysed within a consistent 
macroeconomic framework. Such a framework 
can be provided by macroeconomic models. 
They present a simplified depiction of complex 
economic relationships. This reduction in com -
plexity allows for a greater focus to be placed 
on the relationships that are of particular inter -
est in each case. This is especially helpful when 
analysing the current account balance, as it is 
the result of a multitude of economic decisions 
and policy measures both at home and abroad. 
The current account balance is therefore a 
highly endogenous variable within an intricate 
network of macroeconomic interrelationships. 
However, the necessary reduction in complex -
ity in the models comes at a cost: all of the 
potentially relevant aspects can no longer be 
equally represented. For this reason, the 
Bundes bank’s toolset for macroeconomic ana -
lyses includes a variety of models in order to 
take account of the widest possible range of 
potentially relevant factors and to take advan -
tage of the relative benefits of each individual 
model type.
This article will begin by describing the devel -
opment of the German current account over 
the past three decades. Then, it will present the 
results of an analysis on the driving forces be -
hind the current account. This will be followed 
by an investigation into the possible impact of 
demographic trends and labour market re -
forms. Lastly, the outcomes of selected policy High surplus on

and European Commission (2020). In its External Sector Re -

the German current account surplus exhibits a positive 
deviation  of around 4½% of GDP over its value according 
to the underlying fundamentals.

The evolution of global current account balances
Time and again, the international debate 
shines a spotlight on current account bal-
ances. This was notably the case in the mid- 
2000s, when current account surpluses and 
defi  cits in relation to gross domestic prod-
uct (GDP) rose sharply in many countries, 
reaching considerable heights in some in-
stances. However, surpluses or defi  cits in 
the current account are not problematic per 
se. Current account defi  cits give developing 
and emerging market economies the op-
portunity to accelerate the pace of catch- up 
by taking on higher external debt. Con-
versely, current account surpluses enable 
advanced economies to invest assets 
abroad. In this respect, differences in cur-
rent account positions can be an expression 
of rational asset decisions. However, high 
negative and potentially unsustainable bal-
ances risk giving rise to abrupt adjustments 
and subsequent economic crises.
In general, current account imbalances 
have become less important in recent 
years.1 In 2018-19, the weighted average 
current account balance amounted to 3¼% 
of GDP for surplus countries and to 2½% of 
GDP for defi  cit countries.2 Prior to the 
global fi  nancial crisis, in 2006-07, the fi  gure 
had stood at 7% and 4½%, respectively. 
This observation is also backed up by an an-
alysis of unweighted balances, which places 
greater emphasis on developments in 
smaller economies.3 In the same vein, par-
ticularly pronounced defi  cits are shown to 
have decreased signifi  cantly.4
The scale of the adjustment varied quite 
considerably within the individual groups of 
countries. The surpluses of emerging mar-
ket economies contracted to a much 
greater extent than those of industrial 
countries. Declining commodity prices had a major part to play in this. By contrast, def-
icits were reduced only slowly in recent 
years, unlike in the group of industrial coun-
tries.5 However, particularly high defi  cits 
that could be considered unsustainable, as 
were widespread prior to the global fi  nan-
cial crisis, also decreased markedly amongst 
emerging market economies.6
Looking at individual countries and regions, 
the discussion has focused time and again 
on the current account defi  cit of the United 
States. Up until the mid- 2000s, its defi  cit 
steadily expanded to almost 6% of GDP . 
This development was attributed, amongst 
other things, to the role of the United States 
as a major recipient of rapidly expanding 
1 The analysis included the 70 most economically im-
portant countries, as measured by purchasing power 
adjusted GDP in 2019, plus seven smaller euro area 
countries. Together, they account for more than 95% 
of global GDP . The data were taken from the World 
Economic Outlook published by the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) in April 2020.
2 GDP adjusted for purchasing power is used to 
weight national current account balances.
3 Unweighted average defi  cits have decreased since 
the mid- 2000s from just over 6% to 3% most recently. 
Over the same period, average surpluses fell from just 
under 9% to 5½%.
4 In the mid- 2000s, the unweighted average current 
account balance of the fi  ve countries with the largest 
surpluses stood at around 27% of GDP; at last count, 
it amounted to 12½%. The average defi  cit of the fi  ve 
countries with the largest defi  cits decreased from 15% 
to 7%.
5 The divergent courses taken by the surpluses and 
defi  cits of industrial and emerging market economies 
in recent years are also likely to mirror changes in price 
competitiveness. In the wake of the global fi  nancial 
crisis, the Chinese currency appreciated distinctly in 
real terms against a broad range of trading partners’ 
currencies, which was also refl  ected in a deterioration 
in China’s price competitiveness, amongst other 
things. This facilitated a narrowing of the current ac-
count surplus. The currencies of major industrial re-
gions, such as those of the euro area and Japan, 
tended to depreciate in real terms over the same 
period, making it diffi   cult to reduce current account 
surpluses. See International Monetary Fund (2019).
6 The average defi  cit of the three countries with the 
largest defi  cits among the emerging market econ-
omies was still 9½% in 2007 but had shrunk to just 
6¾% by 2019.Deutsche Bundesbank

global savings at that time.7 Following the 
considerable contraction of the current ac-
count defi  cit during the fi  nancial and eco-
nomic crisis, it stabilised at around 2½% of 
GDP in the 2010s and has not declined any 
further since 2018 despite far- reaching 
trade policy measures taken by the US Ad-
ministration.8,9
The euro area countries, in particular, con-
tributed to the decline in global defi  cits. In 
the course of increased economic integra-
tion, some economies had built up current 
account defi  cits – some of which were sig-7 See Bernanke (2005) as well as Hoffmann et al. 
(2019).
8 For an overview of the measures and their conse-
quences, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2020a). Starting 
in 2018, the United States’ highly expansionary fi  scal 
stance in the wake of the country’s tax reform prob-
ably also made it more diffi   cult to further narrow its 
current account defi  cit (see Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2018a)).
9 The United States’ special role with regard to global 
risk sharing probably goes some way towards explain-
ing its persistent current account defi  cit. The bulk of its 
external assets consist of relatively risky assets such as 
equities, while most of its external debt is made up of 
US dollar- denominated and fi  xed- rate bonds. In nor-
mal times, the United States thus generates positive 
risk premia, which is why its persistent negative net 
external position is also likely to be sustainable to some 
extent (see Gourinchas et al. (2017)).Current account balances of selected economies and groups of countries

nifi  cant – by 2008.10 These were deemed 
unsustainable by the markets and led to 
capital outfl  ows from the countries con-
cerned. Owing to the massive damper on 
domestic demand resulting from the global 
fi  nancial and economic crisis, the defi  cits 
decreased signifi  cantly. This continued in 
many countries even after the European 
sovereign debt crisis had come to an end.11 
In addition, the marked nominal and real 
effective depreciation of the euro and the 
associated increase in the euro area coun-
tries’ price competitiveness helped improve 
their current account balances.12 The cur-
rent account balances of Spain and Italy 
even moved perceptibly into positive terri-
tory, as did that of the euro area as a whole.
One surplus country to attract signifi  cant 
attention is China, whose current account 
balance has experienced major ups and 
downs since the 2000s. Owing to the Chi-
nese economy’s longstanding export- led 
growth model, the current account surplus 
as a percentage of GDP increased from 
around 1½% to almost 10% between 2000 
and 2007. However, this surplus trended 
signifi  cantly downwards in the wake of the 
global fi  nancial and economic crisis. Indeed, 
most recently, the current account was al-
most balanced. A key factor in this is likely 
to have been that Chinese exporters’ sales 
potential on the global markets has been 
largely exhausted and economic growth 
has increasingly shifted to the domestic 
economy.13,14
By contrast, surplus positions narrowed very 
little in most industrial countries. Prior to 
the outbreak of the current crisis, the Neth-
erlands and Germany continued to run high 
surpluses. Outside the euro area, the same 
was true for Denmark, Taiwan and Switzer-
land, amongst others. Japan and South 
Korea were likewise running persistent, al-
beit not so pronounced, surpluses. This was due to export- promoting factors such as 
their role in regional production networks, 
a high degree of competitiveness in some 
cases and global demand for certain 
country- specifi  c products.15,16 Other likely 
important factors were population ageing 
and accumulated external assets, the in-
come from which contributed to the sur-
pluses. Estimates in the IMF’s External Bal-
ance Assessment indicate that the surpluses 
of Japan and South Korea, for example, can 
be explained quite readily in this way. The 
same cannot be said for the pronounced 
balances in Germany, the Netherlands and 
Switzerland.17
As a result of the massive turmoil set in mo-
tion by the coronavirus pandemic, there 
could be quite signifi  cant adjustments to 
current account balances worldwide this 
year – much like there were in the wake of 
the 2008-09 global fi  nancial and economic 
crisis. A signifi  cant adjustment is on the 
horizon in oil- exporting countries owing to 
10 In 2008, the current account defi  cit in Greece 
stood at around 14% of GDP , while Portugal’s 
amounted to almost 12%, Spain’s to 9% and Ireland’s 
to roughly 6%.
11 See also European Central Bank (2017).
12 The aforementioned nominal effective depreciation 
of the euro in the aftermath of the European sovereign 
debt crisis also improved Germany’s price competitive-
ness. This probably contributed, inter alia, to the growth 
in Germany’s current account surpluses up to 2015 as 
well.
13 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2018b).
14 Additionally, the sharp growth in imports of travel 
services as a result of booming Chinese overseas tour-
ism is also having a dampening effect. See Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2015a).
15 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2015b).
16 In this context, another reason is that trade barriers 
for goods are much lower than for services. For ex-
ample, one former governor of the Bank of England 
argued that countries with comparative cost advan-
tages in trade in services, such as the United States and 
the United Kingdom, would tend to generate defi  cits 
owing to this asymmetry, while goods exporters such 
as Germany and China would tend to run surpluses 
(see Carney (2017)). However, the extent to which 
such asymmetries actually matter is disputed (see Boz 
et al. (2018)).

scenarios from simulations featuring up to 
seven macroeconomic models will be dis -
cussed. An overview of the models used in the 
analysis can be found in the box on pp. 27-29. 
The scenarios examined cover fiscal policy 
measures in Germany, structural reforms 
through the liberalisation of the goods market, 
as well as certain changes on the part of key 
trading partners, including a sharp downturn in 
growth momentum in the Chinese economy.
Development of the German 
current account
In recent decades, the German current account 
has recorded surpluses with very few excep -
tions.4 Only in the 1990s was there a longer 
period of negative balances as a result of Ger -
man reunification (see the chart on p. 25).5 This 
phase came to an end at the turn of the millen -
nium, with the current account surplus grow -
ing to 8½% of GDP by 2015. Since then, the surplus has seen a slight decline; however, last 
year, it still amounted to more than 7% and 
therefore remained above the 6% threshold 
value stipulated by the European Commission’s 
procedure for preventing and correcting macro -
economic imbalances. Among the sub- accounts 
of the current account, the trade balance made 
the largest contribution to the positive balance. 
During the period of persistent current account 
surpluses, however, the net external position 
also saw strong growth. As a consequence, 
cross- border flows of investment income made 
up an increasingly significant portion of the 
total current account surplus.
The current account balance is a nominal vari -
able that is affected by price and volume ef -
fects. The widening of the surplus after the A long history of 
current account 
surplusesthe slump in the crude oil price.18 Econ-
omies that generate substantial revenue 
from travel services under normal circum-
stances will also suffer considerable losses. 
In view of the major setback to the inter-
national trade in goods, the same applies to 
countries specialising in the export of indus-
trial goods. The groups of countries affected 
include both economies with current ac-
count surpluses in recent years and those 
with defi  cit positions. Overall, however, 
there is likely to be a marked narrowing of 
surpluses and defi  cits. The risk of abrupt 
corrections associated with the adjustment 
appears to be lower than during the global 
fi  nancial and economic crisis, not least be-
cause of the improved starting position.
18 The IMF expects Saudi Arabia, Norway, Nigeria and 
Iran, for example, to run defi  cits in 2020. See Inter-
national Monetary Fund (2020).

tailed report on the developments in the balance of pay -
ments. See, for example, Deutsche Bundesbank (2020b).

turn of the millennium could, up until the 2008 
global financial and economic crisis, largely be 
explained by the strong quantitative growth in 
exports. For the period from 2011 to 2015, this 
does not apply to the same extent; during this 
time, price effects played a key role.
When looking at the development of the cur -
rent account balance in regional terms, marked 
differences over time can be observed: up until 
2008, the surplus with euro area countries in -
creased sharply – particularly with those that 
were hit especially hard by the subsequent 
debt crisis. Since then, the surpluses with those 
countries have almost completely disappeared. 
After 2011, surpluses grew particularly with 
countries outside of the euro area, above all 
with Asian and American countries (see the 
upper chart on p. 26).
Looking at the current account through the 
lens of macroeconomic saving and investment, 
the rise in the current account balance over the past 20 years was due to both the increase in 
savings relative to GDP as well as to the de -
crease in net investment (also in relation to 
GDP). In this context, with the exception of the 
years 2000 and 2001, the higher savings play a 
quantitatively more significant role. In terms of 
the various sectors, households exhibited in -
creasing saving up until 2008. Their contribu -
tion remained more or less unchanged there -
after. A noteworthy shift occurred in saving 
among non- financial corporations: starting 
from a position of deficit, this sector has now 
almost consistently recorded positive net lend -
ing/ net borrowing for the last 20 years. And 
finally, public sector budgets have contributed 
to the rise in macroeconomic saving since the 
financial crisis through their turnaround from 
general government deficits to surpluses (see 
the lower chart on p. 26).

creased current account surplus, Germany’s net

recent years. Beginning from an almost bal -
anced position, net external assets have risen 
to more than 70% of GDP over the past two 
decades as a result of the continued current ac -
count surpluses.
A model- based explanation 
of the driving forces behind 
the German current account 
surplus
Describing the development of the German 
current account points towards possible driving 
forces, but ultimately cannot explain them. This 
can only be achieved within a consistent theor -
etical framework. Such a framework can be 
provided by economic models. Models used to 
analyse the current account should fulfil a num -
ber of requirements: they should capture sav -
ing and investment behaviour in detail. In this 
context, it would be beneficial if long- term 
structural changes in saving behaviour could 
also be modelled, as these changes explain 
long- term changes in the net external position 
and the current account. In addition, it would 
be desirable for the model to have a multi-  
country structure that covers the major global 
economic players and Germany’s trading part -
ners. A differentiation between the tradable 
and non- tradable goods sectors would allow 
for additional insight. Finally, it should also be 
possible to examine a variety of fiscal and eco -
nomic policy measures. However, it is difficult 
for a single model to fulfil all of these criteria. 
For this reason, a number of different models 
are employed to analyse the development of 
the current account. The following sections of 
this article present a range of models that the 
Bundesbank uses for policy analyses. The box 
on pp. 27-29 provides a description of the key 
models and their characteristics.
To start off, the key driving forces behind the 
German current account balance since the year 
2000 are examined from the perspective of the

Macroeconomic models for analysing the German current 
account surplus
The Bundesbank uses a wide range of 
macroeconomic models for policy analysis. 
These models can be divided broadly into 
two categories. First, semi- structural models 
are a standard tool for macroeconomic pro-
jections and simulations. Second, these 
more traditional models have been supple-
mented in recent years by dynamic stochas-
tic general equilibrium (DSGE) models.
Semi- structural models depict macro-
economic relationships within a macro-
economic theoretical framework. However, 
they are less strongly rooted in theory and 
instead primarily achieve a high degree of 
consistency with the empirical observations. 
This means that they tend to be easier to 
expand and are therefore often more com-
prehensive than DSGE models. The latter 
display strong micro- foundations of the de-
cisions made by economic agents. They are 
typically based on an assumption made by 
a representative economic agent that as-
sumes an infi  nite time horizon when mak-
ing its economic decisions. This is why 
forward- looking expectations play a greater 
role in these models than in semi- structural 
models.
DSGE models, in particular, are designed for 
short to medium- term analyses. Their main 
purpose is to study the adjustment pro-
cesses of the economy towards a long- term 
equilibrium. However, the models leave 
parts of this long- term economic equilib-
rium undetermined; these are specifi  ed ex-
ogenously. This has important implications 
for the analysis of current account balances 
using these models, as this long- term equi-
librium also generally includes the net exter-
nal asset position. As the net external asset 
position is a result of developments in the 
current account balances, it is thus only possible for the current account to deviate 
from its exogenous equilibrium in the short 
to medium term.1 Structural changes in cur-
rent account balances are virtually impos-
sible to model in standard DSGE models. 
However, such shifts in current account 
equilibria are self- evident, owing to a per-
manent change in saving behaviour, for ex-
ample. Model extensions, such as the inclu-
sion of saving for old- age provision or pre-
cautionary saving against the risk of invol-
untary unemployment, allow for longer- term 
adjustment processes to be analysed, too. 
One model class commonly used in this 
context is that of overlapping generation 
models (OLGs).2
The analyses described in this article are 
carried out using models covering all three 
of the described classes. In concrete terms, 
up to seven models for policy simulations 
are analysed:
– EAGLE: Euro Area and Global Economy 
Model (Gomes et al. (2012));
– FzBBKM: Forschungszentrum Bundes-
bank Multicountry Model (Hoffmann et 
al. (2020));
– FiMod: Fiscal Policy Model (Stähler and 
Thomas (2012));
– FiModOLG: Fiscal policy model with OLG 
structure (Ruppert and Stähler (2020));
1 From a technical point of view, the exogeneity of the 
net external position is necessary in order to make the 
long- term model equilibrium – the “steady state” – de-
terminable. This is a prerequisite for solving such 
models.

– NiGEM: National Institute Global Econo-
metric Model (https://nimodel.niesr.ac.uk);
– MEM: Macroeconometric Model of the 
Bundesbank (Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2019b, 2019c)).
In addition to these models, there is also a 
comprehensive OLG model for modelling 
demographic developments and a model 
for incorporating a motive of precautionary 
saving against the risk of involuntary un-
employment (see the box on p. 32). These 
latter two models (as well as FiModOLG) 
are suitable for endogenously determining 
the long- term equilibrium of the economy. The other DSGE models attribute adjust-
ments in the current account to its long- 
term exogenous equilibrium.
The models used cover a wide range of 
modelling structures and purposes. NiGEM 
and MEM belong to the class of semi- 
structural macroeconometric models. 
EAGLE, FzBBKM, FiMod and GEAR are DSGE 
models. FiModOLG is an extension of the 
FiMod model that allows for permanent 
shifts in the net external position due to its 
inclusion of overlapping generations.3

can analyse adjustment processes both 
within and outside of the euro area. 
FzBBKM is a three- country model that fo-
cuses on analysing the German economy. 
NiGEM is a comprehensive multi- country 
model of the National Institute of Economic 
and Social Research (NIESR), which is regu-
larly used at the Bundesbank for analysing 
policy measures in an international context. 
MEM is the macroeconometric model of 
the Bundes bank. It serves as the basic 
model for the semi- annual projections for 
Germany’s economy,4 and is also regularly 
used for policy analyses. Like FzBBKM, both 
FiMod and FiModOLG have a multi- country 
structure and –  similarly to GEAR  – have 
been developed primarily for analyses in the 
areas of fi  scal policy and the labour mar-
ket.5 The table on p. 28 provides an over-
view of the main characteristics of the 
models used.
The four DSGE models (FzBBKM, EAGLE, 
GEAR and FiMod) form a closely related 
family of models, as they all operate under 
forward- looking expectations. In the two 
semi- structural macroeconometric models, 
forward- looking expectations play a smaller 
role (NiGEM) or no role at all (MEM). The 
adjustments therefore tend to be more 
gradual in these models than in DSGE 
models. FiModOLG is the only one of the 
seven models that allows long- term saving 
to be determined endogenously.
Except for MEM, all seven are multi- country 
models in which other countries or regions 
of the world are explicitly modelled. This 
means that cross- border spillovers are de-
termined endogenously within the model. 
FzBBKM and EAGLE allow for two sectors 
to be analysed, namely those of tradable 
and non- tradable goods. The other models 
include only one production sector. Ultim-
ately, various fi  scal policy options are well 
represented in all of the models, with only FzBBKM having a rather rudimentary struc-
ture in this regard. For example, public 
invest ment in EAGLE, GEAR, FiMod, 
FiModOLG and NiGEM is not only an elem-
ent of aggregate demand, but also an im-
portant input factor in the production pro-
cess. This allows the supply effects of gov-
ernment investment expenditure to be cap-
tured, too.6

and has since been employed for policy ana -
lyses (FzBBKM; see the box on pp. 27-29).6 It is 
one of the larger- scale DSGE models used at 
the Bundesbank. The model contains three re -
gions (Germany, the euro area excluding Ger -
many and the rest of the world) and allows 
tradable and non- tradable goods to be differ -
entiated.7 The analysis focuses on net exports 
(i.e. the trade surplus), as it is this part of the 
current account that is –  as already estab -
lished – a significant factor in current account 
balance developments in Germany.8
In a DSGE model, the endogenous variables 
– the variables determined by the model itself – 
are determined by two things: through the 
interaction between the endogenous variables 
themselves, and through exogenous, unfore -
seeable processes, known as shocks. Each devi -
ation of a model- endogenous variable from its 
equilibrium can be attributed to the contribu -
tions of the underlying shocks. The same ap -
plies to trade surpluses. The results of such a shock decomposition in the Bundesbank DSGE 
model are presented below.
These model- based shock decompositions 
should always be interpreted with a certain 
level of caution, however. If a model is (suffi -

7 It was estimated on a quarterly basis for the period from 
1995 to 2017 using Bayesian methods. The model contains 
a wide range of structural shocks. In order to make the re -
sults easier to interpret, the shocks were classified into nine 
different groups of shocks to explain developments in the 
trade surplus. For Germany, these shocks relate to the areas 
of technology, saving, investment, government spending, 
wages and residual shocks (these also include shifts be -
tween the sectors of tradable goods and non- tradable 
goods, and in the profit margins). To these are added mon -
etary policy shocks in the euro area and combined shocks 
in the rest of the euro area and the rest of the world. The 
model does not include an exchange rate shock.
8 It is generally also possible to extract the current account 
balance from the model. That said, trade surpluses were 
used for the model estimation, which means that the 
model- implied current account balances do not necessarily 
match the corresponding figures from official statistics. This 
is why the shock decomposition was only carried out for 
trade surpluses.Deutsche Bundesbank

ciently strongly) misspecified, the shocks may 
not measure the underlying economic deter -
minants. Furthermore, DSGE models, initially 
designed for business cycle analysis, only depict 
cyclical deviations of macroeconomic variables 
and developments from one particular equilib -
rium value. Its explanatory power thus refers 
exclusively to such deviations. This means that 
such analyses cannot explain structural com -
ponents of the German current account sur -
plus. This does not, however, render these 
models obsolete in current account analyses as 
it is also worth examining the causes of devi -
ations in the current account balance from its 
equilibrium.
The Bundesbank DSGE model explains the dy -
namics of trade surpluses since the turn of the 
millennium through to the 2008 economic cri -
sis mainly by means of four determinants 
(shocks): the rising level of savings in Germany, 
low government spending, (favourable) devel -
opments in the rest of the euro area and the 
domestic production technology (see the chart 
on p. 30). The relatively strong domestic invest -
ment activity had a dampening effect during 
this period, though to a lesser degree when 
compared with the contribution from savings. 
The very weak wage growth in Germany dur -
ing this period did not contribute to the rise in 
net exports.
When the financial and economic crisis set in in 
2008, the favourable developments went into 
reverse in the rest of the euro area. The coun -
tries particularly hard hit by the sovereign debt 
crisis underwent severe adjustment processes 
in the course of which their current account 
deficits with Germany came down. For this 
period, the extremely favourable developments 
in countries outside of the euro area explain to 
a large extent the positive deviations of trade 
surpluses from their historical average. This re -
flected the favourable developments in indus -
trial countries such as the United States, but 
also the strong growth in many Asian econ -
omies. Domestic production technology and 
savings continued to contribute positively, al -beit the latter to a lesser extent than in the 
years prior to 2008. Domestic investment and, 
albeit to a limited extent, monetary policy now 
also had an expansionary effect on the bal -
ance.
Overall, the results are in line with the descrip -
tion of the stylised facts, namely that a variety 
of factors contributed to the balance; no single 
factor provides a satisfactory explanation. Stim -
uli from outside Germany played a key role in 
particular. As for domestic factors, saving and 
investment were significant, with government 
spending playing a certain role, too.
As indicated above, the current account’s struc -
tural components cannot be explained in the 
analysis discussed above. However, knowledge 
about these structural components is necessary 
to determine a current account equilibrium. To 
close this gap, alternative models are required. 
Because the current account balance is the re -
sult of the discrepancy between saving and 
invest ment, models that admit permanent 
changes in saving behaviour are of particular 
relevance here. Such models thus also allow an 
analysis of long-  term changes in the net asset 
position as these changes are largely brought 
about by accumulated current account bal -
ances.
A corresponding model in which long- term 
saving decisions and the net asset position are 
endogenously determined shows that the la -
bour market reforms implemented at the start 
of the 2000s raised the level of precautionary 
savings in Germany. This, combined with the 
increased savings by non-  financial corpor -
ations, contributed to a higher current account 
surplus during this period. Another model 
underscores the fact that demographic trends 
will also boost savings and therefore – taken in 
isolation  – increase the current account bal -
ance (see the box on pp. 32-34).Results of a

Long- term changes in saving behaviour and 
the current account
Models that explain long- term changes in 
saving decisions can also explain long- term 
developments in the current account that 
result from these changes. This is illustrated 
here using two models that focus on the 
impact of labour market reforms and demo-
graphic trends on saving.
Labour market reforms and the current 
account1
In the discussion both at home and abroad, 
the labour market reforms introduced after 
the turn of the millennium are often cited 
as a key factor for the rise in the German 
current account balance. Conventional 
DSGE models produce little evidence to 
confi  rm this. One reason for this could be 
that these models cannot adequately cap-
ture any long- term changes in saving be-
haviour as a consequence of the reforms. 
By contrast, within a model framework that 
allows for involuntary unemployment 
against which households with heteroge-
neous employment statuses can only par-
tially insure themselves, there are incentives 
for precautionary saving. The degree of pre-
caution depends on the risk of becoming 
unemployed and on the expected subse-
quent loss of income, which also accounts 
for the expected duration of unemploy-
ment.
By lowering the level of unemployment 
benefi  ts, the labour market reforms in Ger-
many in the early 2000s reduced wage 
claims and increased the effi   ciency of job 
allocation. This lowered the risk of un-
employment. Taken in isolation, this was in-
tended to reduce the propensity to save, as 
it decreased both the likelihood of becom-
ing unemployed as well as the expected duration of remaining unemployed. At the 
same time, however, the lower unemploy-
ment benefi  ts increased the potential loss 
of income in the event of actual unemploy-
ment. In the model simulation, the second 
effect predominated. This means that the 
reforms had a lasting positive effect on do-
mestic saving. However, the higher savings 
were not entirely absorbed by domestic in-
vestment activity. The surplus increased the 
level of net external assets, thereby contrib-
uting to the rise in the current account.
Compared with an analysis excluding pre-
cautionary saving, the German current ac-
count balance was around one- tenth to 
one- third higher between 2005 and 2016. 
In this period, the surplus grew from 4½% 
to 8½%. Nearly 0.6 percentage point – or 
about 15% – of this rise of almost 4 per-
centage points can be explained by a 
greater precautionary savings motive.
Ageing and the current account
An alternative way of explaining the net 
asset position endogenously in macroeco-
nomic models is to introduce ageing as a 
motive for saving. This is possible in a model 
with overlapping generations (OLG model) 
that distinguishes between phases of em-
ployment and retirement. In this case, 
demographic trends have an impact on 
macroeconomic variables – including the 
current account.

An OLG model developed at the Bundes-
bank2 features a number of birth cohorts. 
Members of each cohort have a certain 
probability of dying each year. However, no 
member of a cohort can reach an age of 
more than 100. Alongside Germany, the 
model also depicts the rest of the EU. It is 
an equilibrium model, which allows the 
effects  of the age structure on macroeco-
nomic reference variables to be fully ana-
lysed. The life cycle of households is divided 
into an employment phase and a retirement 
phase. A redistributive public pension insur-
ance scheme is in place. However, house-
holds can also form additional, capital- 
backed private savings both in Germany as 
well as in other EU countries. The formation 
of external assets is calculated as the differ-
ence between the domestic capital supply 
(savings) and domestic capital demand (for 
investment purposes).Demographic trends infl  uence the forma-
tion of wealth in two ways. An ageing

population means that older age groups 
increase  in size relative to younger age 
groups. As older households are wealthier, 
however, the aggregate wealth of all house-
holds rises. This is a purely compositional 
effect that increases the capital supply with-
out individual households having changed 
their saving behaviour as they age, although 
this is likely, too. For example, rising life ex-
pectancy coupled with a fi  xed retirement 
age leads to longer periods of drawing on 
pension benefi  ts. A simultaneously ageing 
and shrinking population results in pressure 
on the redistribution- based pension insur-
ance scheme. These effects are likely to in-crease individual saving. At the same time, 
demand for capital in an ageing and shrink-
ing population is likely to fall. All of these 
factors suggest that countries that are age-
ing more rapidly than others build up a 
larger amount of external assets and, as a 
result, generate higher current account sur-
pluses.3
The model is calibrated taking account of 
current OECD demographic projections. 
Taken in isolation, Germany’s demographic 
trends continue to result in considerable 
upward pressure on the net external pos-
ition and, consequently, the current ac-
count balance. This outlook is somewhat 
limited to the extent that other economies 
are also faced with similar demographic 
prospects. However, the model simulation 
shows that the associated German current 
account surplus would nevertheless be 
positive.4 Here, the model simulations should 
be viewed less as a specifi  c quantitative 
projection and more as an illustration of the 
possible long- term effects of demographic 
change on saving and investment.
3 In this context, household savings already reach their 
highest level many years previously. Demography- 
related current account surpluses therefore materialise 
prior to rising relative old- age dependency ratios.
4 The other EU Member States were also modelled. If 
the model were expanded to include the rest of the 
world, the upward pressure on the German current 
account  balance would likely be even greater. In this 
regard, the aggregate of these countries would, in 
relative terms, create less demographic pressure than 
the EU countries.Impact of demographic change on

Simulations of policy meas -
ures and external changes
The question of which factors have contributed 
to Germany’s high current account surpluses 
and which could contribute to these surpluses 
in the future has been at the heart of the ana -
lyses thus far. Below, policy measures that are 
regularly recommended in national and inter -
national discussions as a means of reducing the 
German current account surplus are to be 
simulated in the selected models. Since devel -
opments in the international arena have also 
played a key role in explaining the balance, ad -
justments in the international setting are also 
included in the analysis.
The scenarios analysed
In light of the regular recommendations to re -
duce the German current account surplus men -
tioned above, the results of three temporary 
fiscal policy measures are described below: an 
increase in government consumption, an in -
crease in government investment and a reduc -
tion in VAT.
Specifically, the fiscal measures are calibrated 
such that they increase the government deficit 
by 1% of GDP over a period of five years. There -
after, policy slowly returns to the fiscal baseline. 
The relevant fiscal rule inherent in the models, 
which is intended to ensure the long- term sus -
tainability of public finances, is suspended for a 
period of ten years. Monetary policy reacts en -
dogenously, usually by setting a short- term 
interest rate, according to a specified monetary 
policy reaction function.
The recommended measures to liberalise the 
services markets are modelled here as a per -
manent reduction in the profit margins in the 
non- tradable goods sector. Such measures can 
only be meaningfully analysed in the two 
models with a multi- sector structure (i.e. EAGLE 
and FzBBKM).Two of the many relevant adjustment mechan -
isms in the international setting have been se -
lected: a marked slowdown in China’s growth 
and an appreciation of the euro exchange 
rate.9
Simulation results
Fiscal policy: increases in government 
consumption 
Higher government consumption boosts ag -
gregate demand directly. In order to adjust pro -
duction accordingly, demand for labour and 
productive capital goes up. Rising wages place 
upward pressure on domestic prices, and price 
competitiveness falls. This dampens German 
exports and encourages import demand. How -
ever, domestic price pressures affect export 
prices, too. This price effect offsets the volume 
effect on the current account balance.
Overall, the models illustrate that higher gov -
ernment consumption reduces the current ac -
count surplus over the simulation horizon (see 
the chart on p. 36). In most of the models, in -
creasing government consumption by 1% of 
GDP lowers the current account balance by ap -
proximately ½ percentage point. In the semi-  
structural models (NIGEM and MEM), however, 
the effects are greater than in the DSGE models; 
this is because semi- structural models have 
more pronounced transmission on the demand 
side. Private consumption, in particular, and 
therefore import demand, too, increase more 
sharply in these models than in DSGE models. 
In their pure form, the latter even include a 
negative effect (“crowding out”) on private 
consumption and private investment. This is 
due to their future- oriented expectations, 
which is heavily emphasised in these models: 
forward- looking households and firms keep an 
eye on the future costs of government deficits 
(known as Ricardian equivalence).Cross- model

The model with overlapping generations (Fi -
ModOLG) shows the quantitatively strongest 
response. This is not only due to a stronger re -
sponse on the part of export or import de -
mand, but also to the long- term shift in Ger -
many’s net asset position. The debt- financed 
fiscal expansion reduces the net external asset 
position and, in turn, cross- border income 
flows. Moreover, each generation has a limited 
life expectancy. As a result, the future costs of 
a current deficit- funded expansion are less rele -
vant than in the DSGE models (so Ricardian 
equivalence no longer applies). This result 
underlines the fact that models in which the 
net international investment position is calcu -
lated endogenously (also in the long- run equi -
librium) are able to generate stronger effects 
on the current account than DSGE models do. 
Indeed, there are reasons to assume that, if 
anything, DSGE models underestimate the ef -
fects on the current account. Furthermore, the 
assumption regarding the existence of Ricard -
ian equivalence is not fully satisfied in the real world. The possible reduction in private con -
sumption resulting from higher government 
deficits is therefore likely to be overemphasised 
in DSGE models.
Fiscal policy: rise in government investment
Similarly, higher government investment has a 
direct effect on demand. However, when com -
pared with higher consumption, the import 
content of this additional demand may be 
greater. The fact that investment may also pro -
duce a supply effect in the models is more im -
portant, however. Productive government in -

tential and raise labour productivity. It thus has 
a more lasting effect on production compared 
with consumption. This becomes especially

forward- looking expectations for household 
consumption and imports. Although, taken by

the upward pressure on prices stemming from 
the increase in demand. Accordingly, price 
competitiveness does not deteriorate as 
strongly, and the decline in exports is less pro -
nounced. Given these different factors, it is not 
clear a priori whether an increase in govern -
ment investment reduces the German current 
account balance more or less strongly than a 
rise in government consumption.
The simulations do not provide a clear picture 
either (see the chart above). In some models 
(EAGLE and MEM), the German current ac -
count surplus shrinks. One reason for this in 
MEM is that the import content of government 
investment is greater than that of government 
consumption. By contrast, the lower loss of 
price competitiveness and the higher level of 
aggregate productivity in other models results 
in a smaller decline or even an expansion in the 
current account surplus (FiMod and GEAR).Fiscal policy: reduction in value added tax
A temporary reduction in value added tax pro -
vides a boost to households’ purchasing power 
by lowering prices after tax. The resulting over -
all increase in aggregate demand in Germany 
stimulates both demand for domestically pro -
duced goods and for imports. In order to sat -
isfy higher demand for domestic goods, the 
demand for labour and capital rises, increasing 
marginal production costs and thus also the 
prices of domestic goods. Domestic price infla -
tion also affects export prices. The associated 
real appreciation dampens export growth and 
additionally promotes imports.10 This reduces 
the current account surplus.A reduction in

10 A similar price effect can be seen for imported goods 
produced abroad, if demand for such goods increases. 
However, since imported goods have a lesser weight in the 
bundle of goods consumed by German households in rela -
tive terms than those produced domestically, and given 
that German demand for goods produced abroad is less 
significant there, this effect is considerably weaker in the 
case of import prices.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
July 2020

The model simulations support these hypoth -
eses (see the chart above); the current account 
surplus decreases in all the examined models. 
This decline is mainly driven by adjustments in 
imports and exports. However, the overall ef -
fect is not particularly strong in most cases. As 
in all other scenarios, the FiModOLG shows the 
most marked decline in the balance. This can 
be explained by the fact that households in 
OLG models have a relatively stable saving goal 
over their life cycle. The trade balance drops 
and capital flows into Germany to finance the 
additional government debt. As net external 
assets decline (at least temporarily), foreign in -
vestment income also decreases, translating 
into a greater reduction in the current account 
surplus.
Structural reforms: goods market 
liberalisation 
In many cases, in addition to more expansion -
ary fiscal policy, steps towards deregulating various services are also recommended as a 
means of reducing the German current account 
surplus. This is based on the expectation that 
this would strengthen the non- tradable goods 
sector in Germany and that the associated ad -
justment processes would increase domestic 
demand for imports in the long term. An im -
pact analysis of such measures requires models 
with a sufficiently differentiated sector struc -
ture. Of the seven models used here, only two 
(FzBBKM and EAGLE) qualify.
Liberalisation in the domestic services sector 
tends to decrease producers’ market power 
and reduce profit margins in the medium term. 
Sales prices fall and demand for goods from 
the domestic services sector rises. Resources 
must be diverted towards production if it is to 
keep pace with the higher demand. This leads 
to higher wages, which also spill over into the 
export- oriented goods sector. Taken in isol -
ation, the shift in domestic demand towards 
domestically produced services lowers import Structural

demand. However, demand for (export) goods 
produced in Germany, which are now more ex -
pensive, also falls. In this modelling framework, 
the prevailing effect on the trade balance and 
thus the current account depends on the as -
sumptions made with regard to enterprises’ 
price- setting behaviour and rigidities. As struc -
tural reforms increase the efficiency of the 
economy as a whole, potential output ex -
pands.11 The now- improved long- term income 
outlook is reflected in stronger import demand. 
However, the resulting rise in income abroad 
also leads to an increase in exports. Given these 
counterbalancing effects, the impact on the 
current account is not clear.
This finding is also reflected in the simulation 
results (see the chart above). In the short term, 
the current account surplus actually increases 
in both models. In the FzBBKM, a positive 
effect  persists even in the long term. However, 
in the EAGLE model, the original stimulus is 
reversed , and after around four years, the cur -rent account surplus is around ¼ percentage 
point lower than prior to the reforms. These 
differences are due to a persistent increase in 
exports in the FzBBKM. The latter can be attrib -
uted to different assumptions regarding the 
price- setting behaviour of exporting com -
panies.12 Interestingly, however, both models 
nevertheless display very similar GDP responses.
Overall, the model simulations suggest that lib -
eralising services in Germany would be unlikely 
to have any noticeable impact on the current 
account surplus.Response of selected variables to a liberalisation of the goods markets*

11 The assumed market power on the part of the enter -

prices, which leads to disproportionately large corporate 
profits from an efficiency point of view. A reduction in this 
wedge gives rise to efficiency gains and, ultimately, to an 
expansion in potential output.

port prices in their domestic currency. This producer cur -

Adjustments in the international environ -
ment: an appreciation of the euro
Exchange rates are important drivers of relative 
prices between Germany and abroad, espe -
cially in the short to medium term, and are 
therefore also significant for current account 
balances. In the following, a 10% effective ap -
preciation of the euro over a five- year period is 
investigated (see the chart above). Effective 
means that the exchange rate movement is 
broadly based across the most important Ger -
man trading partners. Combined with price ad -
justments at home and abroad, this would also 
lead to a marked appreciation in real terms, 
stimulating imports and dampening exports. 
Aggregate output in Germany declines and do -
mestic prices fall in this scenario.
Some goods exported by Germany are invoiced 
in domestic currency, i.e. the euro (producer 
currency pricing). In the case of these goods, 
falling domestic prices also affect export prices in euro. From a non- German perspective, how -
ever, the reduction in the price of such goods, 
expressed in the respective local currency, is 
limited, as the euro appreciates at the same 
time. The current account surplus decreases 
markedly, by ½ to 1 percentage point.13
Adjustments in the international environ -
ment: economic downturn in China
Particularly in the years after 2010, the German 
current account surplus was driven –  as de -
scribed above – by growth in exports to coun -
tries outside Europe. The rapid catching- up 
process in the Chinese economy played a key 
role in this regard. Against this background, the An appreciation

13 Only the EAGLE model bucks this trend, showing a drop 
in the balance of almost 4 percentage points. Here, export 
prices (in euro) fall more sharply. This is due to the assump -
tion that exporters’ price- setting is based on the conditions 
in the local sales markets (local currency pricing). This reac -
tion indicates that price setting in the international context 
may have a significant impact on the current account bal -

question arises as to the extent to which a 
slowdown in growth momentum in China 
could affect the German current account. To 
explore this, a simulation was carried out using 
the NiGEM semi- structural multi- country 
model, which assumes a 3  percentage point 
reduc tion in private consumption growth and a 
12  percentage point decline in investment 
growth in China. These shocks are assumed to 
last for two years. Thereafter, the Chinese 
economy slowly returns to its old growth path.
The increased importance of the Chinese econ -
omy is evidenced by the fact that an economic 
downturn in China, such as the one considered 
here, would have global repercussions. In this 
simulation, global GDP falls, and inflation also 
declines worldwide. As a result, German ex -
ports sink and imports increase. European 
monetary policy becomes looser in reaction to 
these developments, which bolsters domestic 
output and private consumption. This also 
stimulates import demand. The German cur -rent account surplus is reduced by around 
1 percentage point in this simulation (see the 
chart above).
Conclusion
The model analyses of the German current ac -
count surplus presented here provide both 
methodological and economic policy insights.
In terms of explaining the drivers of the Ger -
man current account surplus, the analysis based 
on the Bundesbank’s DSGE model produces 
results  that are largely in line with the descrip -
tive stylised facts. It suggests that the high cur -
rent account surplus (relative to its historical 
average) is attributable to a variety of factors. 
These include domestic factors such as com -
paratively large savings and relatively weak in -
vestment. International factors also play a key 
role. Prior to 2008, there was strong demand 
from other euro area countries for German Insights into

products, but this abated with the financial and 
economic crisis. Since then, countries outside 
the euro area have increasingly contributed to 
large current account surpluses in Germany.
In addition to its high level, a particular feature 
of the German current account surplus is its 
persistence. However, models that focus on ex -
plaining short- term deviations from an equilib -
rium path have shortcomings in terms of ana -
lysing persistently high surpluses. Including de -
terminants of long- term current account pos -
itions could therefore be promising for future 
modelling efforts. For instance, simulations 
using some of the Bundesbank’s own models 
suggest that the labour market reforms at the 
beginning of the 2000s could have had a last -
ing effect on the current account. Furthermore, 
the strong ageing trend of the German popula -
tion is also likely to increase domestic savings in 
the foreseeable future.
This would suggest that reducing the surplus 
should not be made a primary policy goal. That 
being said, it is nevertheless interesting to study 
the effect the regularly suggested measures 
may have on the balance. The results of the 
simulations presented here confirm that the 
regularly recommended policy measures would 
tend to reduce the high current account sur -
plus in Germany. A fiscal expansion that height -
ens the government deficit has a more pro -
nounced effect in the short term for some of 
the simulated measures than an easing of regu -
lations in the services market. However, the ef -
fects of fiscal measures are likely to be limited if 
the regular fiscal space is to be maintained.
Adjustments in the international environment 
could have a much greater impact on the Ger -man surplus position. For example, a sharp 
slowdown in growth in China or a sustained 
appreciation of the euro would significantly re -
duce the current account balance.
National measures on any plausible scale are 
insufficient to bring about a significant reduc -
tion in the German current account balance. If 
the surplus is to be lowered substantially, the 
international environment would also have to 
change.
The COVID-  19 pandemic has resulted in a de -
velopment that is expected to have a signifi -
cant impact on the German current account. 
For instance, this year, global economic output 
is dwindling, international trade has collapsed 
and is recovering only slowly, and Chinese eco -
nomic growth is decreasing sharply. This is hit -
ting the German economy particularly hard, 
given its dependence on exports. Moreover, 
German fiscal policy is using many instruments 
to counter the consequences of the pandemic, 
and last year’s fiscal surplus position will turn 
into a significant deficit this year.
Although the model analyses do not explicitly 
capture such a comprehensive shock, the vari -
ous simulations, taken together, nevertheless 
suggest that the coronavirus crisis will result in 
a considerably reduced current account sur -
plus. The Bundesbank’s recently published pro -
jection factors in such a development, with the 
surplus expected to decline from above 7% to 
below 5% of GDP this year. The surplus is not 
expected to exceed the 6% threshold specified

Cash hoarding by German households – 
how much cash do they store and why?
Since the introduction of euro cash in 2002, the Bundesbank has issued approximately €780 bil -
lion net worth of banknotes and coins. Thus, the cash in circulation issued in Germany has 
increased annually by an average of 8%. A considerable portion of this cash has migrated abroad 
to other European countries and to countries outside Europe by means of travel and the inter -
national wholesale banknote market. In addition to the use of cash as a means of payment, by 
far the largest share of cash in circulation in Germany is attributable to hoarding, i.e. the long- 
term storing of cash by households and firms.
The amount of cash held by individuals (i.e. not firms and credit institutions) outside their wallets 
was captured in a representative household survey. According to this study, individuals in Ger -
many kept an average of €1,364 in cash at home or in a safe deposit box at a bank in 2018. Cash 
reserves were therefore significantly higher than the amounts of cash that individuals keep in their 
wallets for short periods of time for transaction purposes (roughly €107). The distribution of the 
amounts among the population was extremely uneven and highly concentrated. Older people, 
higher earners and self- employed people held the highest amounts of cash reserves on average.
Furthermore, the data were used to investigate whether cash reserves could be related to tax 
offences (e.g. not disclosing assets to the government). However, a regression analysis could not 
confirm this assumption. Instead, a lack of trust in the security and robustness of the technical 
infrastructure (e.g. fear of cyber attacks) appears to be a major factor in explaining cash reserves.Deutsche Bundesbank

Background
Since the introduction of euro cash in 2002, 
the Bundesbank has brought cash worth 
around €780 billion net into circulation. Official 
statistics on the use and retention of issued 
banknotes and coins are scarce since cash is 
anonymous. The Bundesbank therefore pro -
duces regular research reports, which analyse 
the cash in circulation in Germany and abroad 
using several different empirical methods. This 
article examines the cash reserves held by indi -
viduals in Germany in 2018.1
A central bank’s net cash issuance can be used 
domestically as well as abroad. With regard to 
the domestic circulation of cash, a further dis -
tinction is made between the domestic transac -
tion balances and domestic hoarding balances. 
The transaction balances comprise cash that is 
used at short notice to purchase goods and 
that is part of the constant cash cycle between 
the Bundesbank, commercial banks, retailers 
and consumers. By contrast, the hoarding bal -
ances serve as longer- term stores of value and 
are withdrawn from the constant cash cycle for 
the time being.2
Out of the €690 billion worth of banknotes 
issued  in 2018, an estimated amount of just 
under €423 billion ended up in circulation 
abroad as a result of migration by means of the 
international wholesale banknote market and 
travel.3 The Bundesbank estimates the domes -
tic transaction balances to be approximately 
€58 billion, based on data from the payment 
behaviour study,4 retailers’ cash revenue and 
credit institutions’ cash holdings. By contrast, 
estimating domestic hoarding proves difficult. 
Hoarding has thus far only been calculated in -
directly by means of macroeconometric models 
and constitutes a residual. Previous estimates 
assume a volume of around €200 billion held 
by the private non- bank sector (households 
and firms).
This report examines cash reserves in the 
household sector using interviews followed by a microeconometric analysis of the survey data. 
In recent years, the inexplicably high volume of 
domestic hoardings has also been linked to in -
formal or illegal activities in public discourse, 
with calls being made for cash payments to be 
restricted or even for cash to be completely 
abolished.5 This report addresses the following 
questions.
– How high is the amount of cash hoarded by 
German households? This comprises all cash 
holdings kept by households that are not 
directly used for transaction purposes.
– What role do age, education, region and 
economic and financial situation play?
– Are there indications of tax motives for stor -
ing cash (e.g. tax evasion or illicit work)?
– What legitimate reasons for storing cash are 
of significance (e.g. financial or technical se -
curity concerns)?
The survey entitled “Cash use in Germany” was 
conducted in 2018 to address the research 
questions. Roughly 2,000 participants provided 
information on cash reserves they store outside 
their wallets at home or in a safe deposit box at 
a bank. At the same time, the questionnaire 
was used to gather indications of individuals’ 
honesty in tax matters. Owing to the highly 
sensitive topics, the main challenge was ob -

measures were taken to increase individuals’ 
willingness to participate and respond.
The following first outlines the conception of 
the survey and how it was conducted. Subse -
quently, the average amount of privately 
hoarded cash in Germany is calculated using 
the personal data obtained from the survey. In 
addition, the distribution of the amounts 
among the population are analysed descrip -
tively and broken down by socio- demographic 
factors. Finally, a regression analysis is used to 
examine whether there is a correlation be -
tween storing larger amounts of cash and a 
person’s tax morale.
The “Cash use in Germany” 
study
2,000 people were interviewed for the “Cash 
use in Germany” study between January and 
April 2018. The key topics of the survey were 
the possession of cash (particularly euro cash) 
and people’s tax morale. Detailed information 
was also collected regarding participants’ 
socio- demographic background. The study par -
ticipants were selected randomly using a ran -
dom route method. The sample is representa -
tive of the German resident population.
The sensitive topics were the key challenge of 
the study as the inclusion of such topics in vol -
untary surveys can result in low and selective 
participation, interview break- offs, non-  
responses and inaccurate answers. Questions 
about cash ownership relate to a person’s fi -
nancial situation, for instance. Participants may 
not provide information on existing cash re -
serves or may underestimate (underreport) 
them if they have concerns about the integrity 
of the survey. By contrast, questions regarding 
tax morale are based on socially undesirable or 
even illegal behaviour. Participants involved in 
such behaviour may not state the truth out of 
fear of potentially being prosecuted. If the 
sample contains selective non- responses and 
inaccurate answers, the evaluations are no longer representative of the overall population 
and extrapolations are distorted.6
Numerous confidence- building measures were 
put in place to reduce the risk of participants 
answering selectively. Flyers provided informa -
tion on the research aim of the survey. Partici -
pants were able to contact the study manager 
directly if they had any concerns. During the 
interviews, participants had the option of 
entering answers directly into the survey laptop 
without the interviewer seeing, or of submit -
ting answers anonymously at a later date using 
a paper questionnaire. Furthermore, particu -
larly sensitive topics were first introduced with 
more general questions before participants 
were asked about specific, personal circum -
stances.
Distribution and extra-
polation of cash reserves
Analysis of the data shows that individuals in 
Germany stored an average of €1,364 in cash 
per capita outside their wallets in 2018.7 The 
amounts were distributed very unevenly among 
the population. Many people held no cash re -
serves or only a small amount. By contrast, a 
small number of people kept very large sums of 
cash in reserve. The quantile distribution pre -
sented in the chart on p. 50 shows how often 
the various amounts were specified by re -
spondents. 22% had no cash reserves. 50% 
held €200 or less (median). 75% held a max -
imum amount of €500. Amounts over €5,000 
were only observed in 5% of cases (95th per -
centile). The highest figure reported was 
€100,000 (not shown in the chart).Interview survey

On average,

distribution 
6 See, for example, Wooldridge (2010).
7 The cash reserves held by individuals were determined 
using the following questions: “It’s possible to keep cash in 
a piggy bank, a jam jar, under your mattress or in a safe at 
home, as well as in a safe deposit box at a regular bank or 
a savings bank. Taking into account all the above possible 
places where you may store your cash, if you add every -
thing up: What is the total amount of cash you currently 
keep in reserve? Please note that this does not refer to cash 
kept in your wallet or on your person for daily needs”.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
July 2020

The following three reasons can be cited to ex -
plain the uneven distribution: first, there are 
different preferences for cash and book money 
among the population. Second, the distribu -
tion of cash reserves is based on income and 
wealth distribution, which, taken in isolation, is 
already concentrated.8 Third, there could be 
different reasons for storing the individual 
amounts of cash. For instance, larger sums are 
seen when cash is held long- term as a propor -
tion of wealth. Smaller sums probably repre -
sent more of a consumption- related “stand- by” 
reserve, which will be used again for transac -
tion purposes in the foreseeable future.
The results of the 2,000 respondents are repre -
sentative of the total German population over 
the age of 18. According to the Federal Statis -
tical Office, this comprised roughly 69.254 mil -
lion people at the time of the survey.9 This re -
sults in a total of approximately €94 billion 
worth of cash reserves when extrapolated for 
the total population. In terms of the macroeco -nomic estimates for domestic hoarding, roughly 
half of the stocks of hoarded cash in Germany 
(approximately €200 billion) would thus be lo -
cated in households. However, when interpret -
ing this value, account must be taken of under -
reporting of amounts, which is typical in sur -
veys and is to be expected here, despite the 
comprehensive confidence- building measures 
in place during the interviews. In addition to 
intentionally withholding information, individ -
uals could also forget about certain amounts. 
In this case, the reported stocks of hoarded 
cash would be underestimated.10

Socio- demographic 
distribution 
The extremely uneven distribution of cash re -
serves among the population suggests that this 
may also be the result of socio- demographic 
differences. Specifically, the following variables 
are considered here:
– gender (male/ female);
– age;
– region;
– education (no school leaving certificate/  
lower or intermediate secondary school 
leaving certificate/ upper secondary school 
leaving certificate ( Abitur ));
– employment status (employed/ unemployed/ 
retired/ homemaker/ in education or training);
– professional status (wage earner/ salaried 
employee/ civil servant/ self- employed or free -
lancer);
– net household income (in categories).
Mean values and selected percentiles were 
compared to determine group differences re -
garding the storing of cash (see the table on 
p.  52). Since this comparison is based on a 
sample of the total population (n = 2,000), only 
statistically significant differences may be inter -
preted. In this table, the asterisks by the names 
of the socio- demographic variables indicate 
whether the differences are statistically signifi -
cant.11
Very marked differences in cash reserves are 
visible especially with regard to age. Older 
people store more cash on average. However, 
this relationship is not linear. The average cash 
reserves increase up to the age of 65. By con -
trast, from the age of 65 people store less cash 
again. High cash reserves shortly before the 
start of retirement can indicate the accumula -
tion of a reserve for a person’s retirement age, 
which is slowly reduced after the age of 65. 
The chart on p.  53 additionally presents the 
mean and percentile values of the individual 
age groups from the previous table in graphic 
form. This clearly demonstrates that age also has an influence on the distribution of cash re -
serves: larger amounts are seen among older 
people, in particular.
Statistically significant heterogeneities are also 
apparent with regard to income. The average 
cash reserves rise with increasing income but 
their distribution also becomes broader: while 
there are fewer opportunities for low- income 
earners to store cash, cash reserves are broadly 
distributed among very high earners. The chart 
on p.  54 presents the income-  specific mean 
and percentile values of the cash reserves from 
the table on p. 52 in graphic form. As seen in 
the case of age, the lower percentiles are barely 
influenced, i.e. the occurrence of comparatively 
low cash reserves is similar for people with 
higher and lower incomes. Conversely, high 
cash reserves are quite a reliable indication of a 
higher income.
Furthermore, statistically significant differences 
are visible with regard to employment status. 
For example, individuals in education or train -
ing (school pupils, students, trainees) have very 
low cash reserves, which is consistent with the 
observations on age and income effects.
Among those in employment, self- employed 
persons have the largest reserves. It is striking 
that, in comparison to age and income, the 
status of self- employment significantly in -
creases the amounts from as early on as the 
75th percentile. Cash receipts from self-  
employed persons’ own business transactions 
are the obvious explanation for this. Civil ser -
vants keep the smallest cash reserves. How -
ever, the low figures reported here could also 
be the result of more cautious responses given 
by civil servants, who have a reputation for 
being risk averse.12Analysis of

11 To determine statistical significance, the cash reserves 
were regressed linearly on the respective socio- demographic 
group characteristic and heteroscedasticity- robust standard 
errors were calculated. This method was used in preference 
to a simple t- test as the variance of cash reserves can also 
differ across the individual groups (heteroscedasticity).

Statistically significant differences in cash re -
serves can also be identified depending on na -
tionality. On average, German study partici -
pants keep around €1,100 more cash in reserve 
than foreign participants. The fact that there 
are national differences in cash holdings is al -
ready known from the demand for cash for 
short- term transaction purposes.13 For ex -
ample, studies show that Germans also keep 
larger amounts of cash in their wallets by inter -
national standards.
Cash reserves and tax morale
The reasons people keep cash reserves can be 
many and varied. From an economic perspec -
tive, one of the first questions to emerge, for 
example, is whether the reserves are regarded 
as long- term assets or as medium to long- term 
liquidity reserves for future transactions. The 
former could be identified using portfolio the -
ories on asset diversification, which model cash reserves as a function of the risk and return of 
the individual forms of investment.14 For the 
latter, cash demand models could be employed 
– such as those developed by Baumol and 
Tobin, in which cash reserves depend, in par -
ticular, on transaction costs, interest foregone, 
and planned consumption.15 However, this 
study takes a current issues- based approach 
and, in line with current socio- political debate, 
primarily questions the extent to which cash re -
serves might be linked to the desire to keep 
income and assets private from the govern -
ment.
To this end, the study participants were asked a 
general question on the reasons for storing 
cash: “Why do you think that some people 
today choose to keep their savings in the form 
of cash? Please outline the three key reasons … and origin

to €2,293.

for this from your viewpoint”. The respondents’ 
answers are shown in the chart on p. 55. The 
evaluation focused on the responses of people 
who actually keep cash reserves themselves, 
since the objective is to draw conclusions about 
this group’s own behaviour. Financial and prac -
tical considerations are revealed as the most 
important: “Savings at a bank yield little inter -
est these days” (58%), “Cash is the most com -
mon means of payment” (55%), “Cash can be 
used even if technology fails” (41%) and “Cash 
does not involve fees” (31%) were the most fre -
quent answers given. The protection of per -
sonal data through the anonymity of cash is 
nonetheless important to 23% of respondents. 
Protection against bank or government crises, 
which has probably been an issue for investors 
over the last few years, was cited less fre -
quently by respondents in 2018 (19%). Tax mo -
tives only rank near the bottom of the list: 12% 
of people who keep cash reserves agree that 
an important reason for doing so is that “cash 
reserves are a good way of keeping your money secret, and safe from the hands of govern -
ment”. Only potential security gaps in banks’ IT 
systems (6%) and hiding savings from friends 
and relatives (5%) are less frequently cited as 
motives.
Assuming that cash holders initially answered 
these questions based on their own behaviour, 
an upper limit can be derived for the existence 
of tax motives among the general public. In 
this case, it would not be possible to rule out 
the existence of tax motives among 12% of 
cash holders. For 88% of this group, however, 
there would be no evidence of such motives.
A multivariate regression is used to further ana -
lyse whether tax considerations could play a 
role in cash reserves. The question at the heart 
of this analysis is: do people with poor tax mor -
ale have higher cash reserves on average?
In order to assess tax morale, study participants 
were asked whether the following statement Regression

by people in this income group came to €1,571.

applied to them: “I’m perfectly happy to pay 
my taxes in Germany as I know that the gov -
ernment finances a lot of important things with 
this money”. 17% of those surveyed disagreed 
somewhat or disagreed strongly with this state -
ment. In the following, we assume that the tax 
morale of this group tends to be poorer.
The table on p. 57 shows the results of a multi -
variate least squares estimate in which a per -
son’s logarithmic cash reserves are regressed 
on the indicator for tax morale, various legitim -
ate reasons for holding cash and different 
socio- demographic factors (e.g. age and in -
come effects) (see the box on p. 56). The coef -
ficient of the indicator for tax morale is not 
statistically significant.16 Therefore, the regres -
sion does not indicate that tax evasion played a 
role in cash reserves.
In order to check the robustness of this result, 
three alternative indicators for assessing tax 
morale were derived from the questionnaire. In 
each case, a person was assumed to have rela -
tively poor tax morale if they stated that, within 
the last ten years, they had worked off the 
books (4%), had considered working off the 
books (13%), or had personal acquaintances 
who worked off the books (18%). Even if these 
indicators are used in the regression, there is 
no significant correlation between a person’s tax morale and their cash reserves. For a de -
tailed description of the results, see Eschelbach 
and Schneider (2020).
However, the table shows a very clear positive 
correlation between cash reserves and the vari -
able “fear of cyber attacks”. The cash reserves 
held by people who have doubts as to the se -
curity of banks’ IT systems are 62% higher on 
average ([exp(0.4829)-1]*100% = 62%). In the 
direct interviews, participants relatively rarely 
cited technical security concerns as a reason for 
keeping cash reserves (5%). However, if a per -
son does keep cash reserves on account of 
such concerns, the amounts held appear to be 
relatively large. This could be related to the fact 
that people fear financial losses in the event of 
a cyber attack, which tends to result in smaller 
holdings of bank deposits and larger cash re -
serves.
The opposite situation applies where concerns 
about the reliability of electronic systems are in -
volved (“fear of technical failure”). In the inter -
views, such fears were relatively often cited as 
the reason for cash reserves (41%), but demon -
strate no impact in the regression of the 
amounts held. Since a technical failure in the 17% of

Regression analysis of the reasons for keeping cash 
in Germany
Regression analysis can provide additional 
clues about the existence of tax motives for 
keeping cash. If cash reserves are motivated 
by tax considerations, persons with poor tax 
morale should, on average, keep more cash 
than persons with good tax morale. Such dif-
ferences may, however, also be due to differ-
ing group compositions with regard to age, 
income and other explanatory factors. Multi-
variate regression analysis allows an estima-
tion of a partial correlation between cash re-
serves and tax morale, adjusted for the effects 
of other explanatory variables. It is important 
to understand that only the effects of ob-
served factors can be excluded. If there are 
unobserved differences between persons with 
good and poor tax morale that have an im-
pact on hoarding behaviour, it will not be pos-
sible to tell anything about causality even with 
the help of a regression. The estimated values 
may therefore be interpreted merely as an 
attempt  to approximate the actual impact 
(see, for example, Wooldridge 2010).
What is estimated is a linear model of the 
form
ln(y + 1) = α + βx + γ’W + δ’Z + u.
The dependent variable y  contains the 
amounts of cash hoarded by a single person. 
Owing to their skewed distribution (a small 
number of very high observation values in the 
right- hand tail), they are converted into loga-
rithms for the regression. The key explanatory 
variable of the model, x , is an indicator vari-
able for tax morale. It assumes the value of 
one if, according to the questionnaire re-
sponse, the person tends to be rather unwill-
ing to pay taxes. W is a vector with indicator 
variables for various legitimate reasons for 
holding cash reserves (data protection is im-
portant for the person, the person doubts the 
reliability of modern technology, the person 
doubts the security of banks’ IT systems, the 
person is afraid of a new banking and sover-
eign debt crisis) and Z is a vector with numer-
ous socio- demographic control variables (age, 
gender, level of education, household size, 
net household income, employment status, self- employment, nationality, western/ eastern 
Germany, assessment of fi  nancial situation). u 
stands as an error term for all the other deter-
minants of cash hoarding not contained in the 
model. The model estimates α, the constant, 
as well as β, γ, and δ, the slope parameters of 
the explanatory variables, using the ordinary 
least squares (OLS) method. The estimated 
value for β  gives the partial correlation be-
tween tax morale and hoarding behaviour. 
The statistical inference of the estimation is 
based on heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation- 
robust standard errors.
In the interviews, around 17% of those 
surveyed  disagree somewhat or disagree 
strongly with the statement “I’m perfectly 
happy to pay my taxes in Germany as I know 
that the government fi  nances a lot of import-
ant things with this money”. For this group, a 
poor tax morale was modelled in the regres-
sion (x/uni00A0=/uni00A01) . With regard to the possible le-
gitimate reasons for holding cash reserves 
(W), the interviews show that data protec-
tion is important for 42% of persons, 70% 
have doubts about the reliability of techno-
logical systems, 62% have doubts concerning 
the security of banks’ IT systems, and 62% 
fear a new banking and sovereign debt crisis. 
The distribution of the socio- demographic 
control variables (Z) may be seen in the last 
column of the table on p. 52.
In a regression, biases in explanatory variables 
may result in a failure to detect the correl-
ations that actually exist between the vari-
ables in question. In the conducted regres-
sion, biases may, for example, occur in the 
case of the indicator variable for measuring 
tax morale if persons state, owing to pressure 
to give socially desirable responses, that they 
are perfectly happy to pay taxes, even though 
this is not the case. In order to prevent in-
accurate answers as effectively as possible, 
participants were explicitly given the option of 
entering a concealed response themselves for 
this interview question.Deutsche Bundesbank

payment process at a point of sale does not 
entail any financial losses, the cash reserves 
held based on this motive are likely to be rela -
tively small.
Data protection considerations and worries 
about government or bank insolvencies play no 
role in the regression of the hoarded amounts. 
The majority of respondents also did not cite 
them as reasons in the interviews.
Furthermore, the regression results confirm the 
socio- demographic differences that have al -
ready been identified. The influence of age on 
cash reserves proves very stable in statistical 
terms. According to the regression, cash re -
serves increase by 1.5% with each additional 
year of age ([exp(0.0145)-1] * 100% = 1.5%). 
However, the regression does not reflect the 
descriptively observed decline in cash reserves 
in the highest age group.17
The regression also confirms the influence of 
financial resources on cash reserves. For in -
stance, the cash reserves of individuals with a 
household income of between €2,500 and 
€3,000 are almost twice as high as those of 
individuals in the lowest income group 
([exp(0.6683)-1]  * 100% = 95%). The control 
variables for participants’ subjective financial 
situation also show significant effects. The cash 
reserves of people who describe themselves 
as  able to “make ends meet” without any 
problems  are almost three times as high as 
those of people with financial difficulties 
([exp(1.075)-1] * 100% = 194%).
Conclusion
According to the results of the interviews, in 
2018, individuals in Germany kept an average 
of around €1,364 in cash at home or in a safe 
deposit box (besides the cash in their wallets). Summary of the 
resultsRegression results explaining the amount

Deutsche Bundesbank17 For the purposes of verification, an additional regression 
was carried out using five age group indicators instead of 
the constant age variables. These showed a steady increase 
in cash reserves up to the highest age group.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
July 2020  
57

The distribution of the amounts was very un -
even and highly concentrated. Older people 
and those with higher incomes tended to hold 
larger cash reserves.
12% of those who kept cash reserves felt that 
tax evasion could play a role in such reserves. 
However, a more detailed regression analysis 
cannot confirm this suspicion for the existing 
observations. Instead, the results of the study 
suggest that the German public primarily keep 
cash reserves for legitimate purposes. In par -
ticular, concerns about the security and reliabil -
ity of technical systems appear to play a role in 
cash reserves.
Looking at the assets of the German popula -
tion as a whole, cash plays a rather minor role. 
Households’ total financial assets (cash, de -
posits, securities, other equity, mutual fund 
shares and claims on insurance corporations) 
amounted to €6,023 billion in 2018, with cash 
(hoarding and transaction balances) account -
ing for around 3.8% of this figure.18 However, 
comparing the cash reserves according to the 
survey (€1,364 on average) with the amounts 
of cash that participants reported carrying in 
their wallets for transaction purposes (€107 on 
average),19 it becomes clear that the general 
public see cash not only as a means of pay -
ment, but also to a large extent as a store of 
value.
The survey did not provide any specific indica -
tions of tax evasion as a motive for keeping 
cash reserves. Since respondents voluntarily 
provided information about the amount of 
their cash reserves and the data showed no 
correlation between the reserves kept and tax 
morale, it is reasonable to assume that the sur -
vey participants kept cash primarily for legitim -ate reasons. As a result, this casts a critical light 
on suggestions that previously unexplained 
cash hoardings in Germany could be used to 
gauge the extent of tax evasion and criminal 
activity.
Compared with the regular studies on payment 
behaviour, this one- off, methodologically time- 
consuming survey on cash reserves merely pro -
vides a snapshot. However, because the pay -
ment behaviour studies indicate that funda -
mental behavioural patterns and attitudes 
toward  cash change only slowly, regularly up -
dating the results presented here would not 
bring a great deal of new information to light.20 
However, firms’ cash holdings could be an im -
portant starting point for future research. This 
study allocated around half of the unexplained 
domestic hoarding stocks to the household 
sector. Nonetheless, it is not clear to what ex -
tent the study underestimated households’ 
cash reserves despite confidence- building 
measures. An additional survey among firms 
about their longer-  term cash reserves could 
shed more light on this issue.
Furthermore, future research in the household 
sector should focus on finding out more about 
the motives for private cash reserves as a 
whole. It would be useful to survey smaller 
groups of people by means of qualitative inter -
views focused on accurately pinpointing certain 
behavioural patterns and motives rather than 
quantitatively recording amounts of cash. The 
link to technical security concerns identified by 
the study could be used as a starting point for 
further research.“Store of value”

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).

For footnotes * and 1 to 6, see p. 44●. For footnote x see p. 47●. + For deposits with
an agreed maturity and all loans excluding revolving loans and overdrafts, credit card
debt: new business covers all new agreements between households or non-financial
corporations and the bank. The interest rates are calculated as volume-weighted
average rates of all new agreements concluded during the reporting month. For
