Commentaries: Economic conditions and Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 61 Economic conditions
1.1 Muted but positive start for the Germany economy in the new 
quarter
The German economy is likely to pick up slightly in the first quarter of 2025.  Both 
industry and construction increased output in January, with one-off effects likely to 
have played a significant part. The rise in industrial output followed a weak year-end. 
The timing of the December public holidays in conjunction with weak industrial activity 
probably played a role here. In the construction sector, the favourable weather condi-
tions provided a slight boost in January.  However, the basic tendency in industry in 
particular remains weak in the first quarter. For the time being, the slight recovery in 
foreign demand for German industrial products has not continued at the beginning of 
the year. This highlights the persistently difficult competitive position. In addition, 
investment is still currently facing headwinds. The high degree of uncertainty surround-
ing economic and political conditions is dampening the propensity to invest, and low 
industrial capacity utilisation is weighing on investment. Private consumption did not 
provide any stimulus to growth at the beginning of the year. Consumers were unsettled 
by the cooling labour market and concerns about job losses, amongst other things. 
They were reluctant to make use of the additional scope for spending on consumption 
that had been created last year by the sharp rise in wages. The services sector as a 
whole, however, is likely to make a slightly positive contribution to growth in the first 
quarter, even without impetus from private consumption. Overall, economic output is 
thus likely to increase slightly in the first quarter, although the underlying cyclical trend 
remains weak. 1) 
1 There were fewer ice days than usual in January. According to the Deutscher Wetterdienst (2025), the weather 
in January was also very mild. For details on the impact of weather influences on economic activity, see 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2025).

Commentaries: Economic conditions and Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 7The future outlook for the German economy is particularly uncertain at present.  
Compared with expectations from the last Forecast for Germany,  the restrictive and 
uncertain trade policy of the United States could dampen exports more strongly, 
especially if more extensive tariffs against the  were to be implemented. At the same EU
time, the considerably more expansionary stance of German fiscal policy, which was 
envisaged in the results of the preliminary coalition talks of the parties negotiating the 
formation of a new government, could give a stronger boost to economic output in the 
coming years.
1.2 Industry remains weak in the underlying tendency
German industrial output continues its weak underlying tendency on the back of 
short-term positive one-off effects.  After a very weak December,  seasonally adjusted 
industrial output rose again in January. It was also up on the previous quarter. The 
weakness in production in December could also have been partly attributable to

Commentaries: Economic conditions and Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 8workers at firms taking longer holidays, due to the timing of public holidays amongst 
other factors. This triggered a positive countermovement in January. The fact that the 
rebound effect was observed across sectors would suggest this is the case. The 
increase in output affected all categories of goods, but capital goods benefited the 
least. There are signs of a continued downward trend, especially in the automotive 
industry. Despite the increase, output in January did not exceed the level of the fourth 
quarter of 2024. For February, the German Association of the Automotive Industry also 
reported a decline in the number of passenger cars produced. 
The trend of recovery in foreign demand for German industrial goods suffered a 
setback.  In January, industrial orders were down significantly on the month and the 
quarter. The fact that there were comparatively few large orders was not the only 
factor here. New orders excluding volatile large orders likewise decreased and were 
below the fourth quarter of 2024. This was mainly due to the decline in demand from 
abroad, which had previously risen for three consecutive quarters. There are so far 
hardly any signs of stronger forward effects owing to the threat of US tariffs on EU 
goods either.  By contrast, domestic demand provided some support, posting a slight 
increase on the quarter. The still weak order situation overall continues to shape 
companies’ short-term outlook. According to the  Institute, production plans in the ifo
manufacturing sector improved slightly in February, but they remained pessimistic. The
 Global Purchasing Managers’ Index  for the manufacturing sector made up S&P ( )PMI
ground in January and February but it remained below the expansion threshold.  4) 
4 Exports to the United States even declined in January compared with the previous quarter. By contrast, the 
export expectations captured by the  Institute increased in February overall. However,  President Trump’s ifo US
announcement that, from April onwards, he intends to impose a 25% tariff on  goods was announced only after EU
these indicators had been collected.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 91.3 No impetus from private consumption but some support from 
service providers
Consumers are still restrained.  This is indicated, amongst other things, by real retail 
sales at the beginning of the year. Although they rose slightly in January, they remained 
below the level of the previous quarter. According to the  survey, both the assess-ifo
ment of the situation and expectations in the retail sector improved in February. They 
remained pessimistic, however. Real sales in the hotel and restaurant sector increased 
in January, but the two  indicators for this industry deteriorated in February. Further-ifo
more, households again purchased fewer cars at the beginning of the year. According 
to data from the German Association of the Automotive Industry, new passenger car 
registrations fell on average in January and February compared with the previous 
quarter. This suggests that it is unlikely private consumption will increase any more at 
first, even though households’ scope for spending was higher last year as a result of 
the sharp rise in wages. 


Commentaries: Economic conditions and Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 10Even without impetus from private consumption, there might be some support from 
service providers in the current quarter.  According to  Institute surveys, firms in ifo
most of the services sectors perceived the situation to be somewhat more favourable 
on average in January and February than in the fourth quarter of 2024. This is particu-
larly true of companies in real estate and other administrative services. Averaged 
across January and February,  Global Purchasing Managers’ Index  for the S&P ( )PMI
entire services sector also rose compared with the previous quarter. It was also above 
the expansion threshold but below its long-term average, which suggests positive but 
subdued growth. 
1.4 Labour market remains stable, outlook again gloomier
Employment developments have recently been less unfavourable than expected in 
the December 2024 Forecast for Germany.  After a slight recovery in the autumn 
months, total employment declined again at the beginning of the year, but only to a 
small extent. The Federal Statistical Office reported a decrease of 11,000 employees in 
January in seasonally adjusted terms. The decline is mainly attributable to the 
downward trend in self-employment, but also to fewer persons working exclusively in 
low-paid part-time jobs. By contrast, employment subject to social security contribu-
tions remained stable to slightly positive until recently. However, the current estimates 
only extend to December 2024. Unfavourable employment developments subsequently 
resumed in the temporary employment sector, which often serves as an adjustment 
reserve in industry, and in the manufacturing sector itself. There were also fewer jobs 
filled in the trade sector. This is mainly offset by the rise in jobs in several services 
sectors. In addition to a number of largely publicly financed sectors, these include 
business-related services, transport and logistics, as well as energy and water supply. 
Short-time work stabilised again following the increase at the start of the fourth 
quarter. The Federal Employment Agency has revised its current projections 
downwards somewhat.

Commentaries: Economic conditions and Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 11Nevertheless, the outlook deteriorated further, implying that the labour market is 
likely to continue to cool down in the near term.  The  employment barometer, ifo
which calculates staff planning for the industrial sector over the next three months, fell 
again in February, dashing hopes of a bottoming out. Plans for job cuts were still 
predominant, especially in the manufacturing and trade sectors. The construction 
sector, too, has now fallen more sharply into negative territory. The latest evaluation 
provided by the employment barometer of the  which looks at all the sectors, IAB,
departed from the positive predictive range. It shows that employment is likely to 
remain broadly stable for the time being, however. The already weak inflow of new 
vacancies reported to the Federal Employment Agency fell again. By contrast, the stock

employees to be replaced due to retirement and the very long process of filling vacant 
positions.  


Commentaries: Economic conditions and Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 12Unemployment rose minimally in February.  After seasonal adjustment, around 2.89 
million people were registered as unemployed, 5,000 more than in January. The 
unemployment rate held steady at 6.2% due to rounding. The outflow rate from 
unemployment into employment is still very low. At the same time, the risk of moving 
from employment into unemployment has been increasing for some time now. 
However, the probability of dismissal remains low in a long-term comparison. Regis-
tered unemployment could rise more significantly again in the coming months. The  IAB
unemployment barometer continued to decline in February and is at its lowest level 
since mid-2020.  
1.5 Energy commodity prices markedly lower recently
Energy commodity prices declined markedly of late.  Gas, in particular, has become 
significantly cheaper in recent weeks. As this report went to press, one megawatt hour 
of gas cost €41 in Europe, which was around 15% less than in January. This was mainly 
due to a certain relaxation of European gas storage requirements, speculation about 
higher volumes of Russian gas supplies and improved weather conditions. Crude oil 
prices also fell markedly over the same period. This was primarily attributable to 
demand concerns related to global trade disputes and the decision by some  OPEC
countries and their partners to expand their production from April onwards.
1.6 Inflation down slightly to 2.6% in February
Price developments at the upstream stages of the economy were uneven.  Import 
prices were up very significantly in January compared with the previous month. This 
was the case for both energy and other goods. By contrast, prices fell slightly in domes-
tic industrial sales. Excluding energy, producer prices remained unchanged. Compared 
with the previous year, however, prices for imports rose by 3.1% and prices in domestic 
industrial sales were up by 0.5%.

Commentaries: Economic conditions and Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 13The inflation rate was somewhat lower in February.  The Harmonised Index of 
Consumer Prices  increased in February by a seasonally adjusted 0.2% on the ( ) HICP
month, after 0.3% in January. Compared with the previous month, prices for services 
rose less sharply in the public sector, as the unusually strong price increases in hospital 
services recently came to an end in January. However, prices of services that are more 
market-based continued to go up slightly. Food prices rose perceptibly after having 
become significantly cheaper in January. Energy prices rose moderately. By contrast, 
other non-energy industrial goods became somewhat cheaper. This was only partly due 
to clothing, whose prices usually fluctuate strongly. Annual headline inflation dropped 
slightly to 2.6%.  Core inflation excluding energy and food likewise decreased slightly 
from 3.6% to 3.1%.
Inflation is expected to come down slightly in the coming months.  This is attributable 
primarily to services. Inflation is slowly easing there from a high level, as the adjust-
ment of prices to the previously sharp rise in costs has probably gradually come to an 
end. The decline in energy commodity prices is also likely to have provided relief. By 
contrast, imports of non-energy goods are exerting upward pressure.  5)

figures, as was the case in January.

2.1 Statutory health insurance scheme
2.1.1 Outturn in 2024
The statutory health insurance ( )SHI  scheme (comprising the health insurance insti-
tutions and the health fund) posted a high deficit of €10 billion in 2024, according to 
preliminary figures.  The deficit was €2½ billion higher than assumed by the group of
 estimators in autumn 2024. This was due to higher spending on benefits (up 8% in SHI
total compared with 2023). The deficit almost doubled on the year. The depletion of 
reserves thus significantly exceeded the politically intended figure.


Commentaries: Economic conditions and Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 16At just over €6 billion, the health insurance institutions accounted for the majority 
of the deficit. At the end of the year, their reserves stood at €2 billion, and were thus 
well below the statutory minimum (just over €5 billion).  The health fund closed the 
year with a deficit of almost €4 billion: a deficit had been expected, as reserves of just 
over €3 billion were earmarked for limiting the rise in the contribution rate. At the end 
of the year, the fund’s reserves amounted to slightly more than €5½ billion (lower limit: 
just over €4½ billion).

Commentaries: Economic conditions and Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 18The SHI scheme’s revenue rose by 4½% compared with 2023.  At 6½%, contribution 
receipts continued to grow substantially. Roughly 1 percentage point of this increase is 
due to the fact that, when averaged annually and across all health insurance institu-
tions, supplementary contribution rates rose by almost 0.3 percentage point to just 
under 1.8%. The fact that central government paid, in total, just over €6 billion less to 
the health fund had a dampening effect: 
The special funds of €2 billion transferred by central government to the health 
insurance institutions to stabilise the contribution rate now fell away.
Coronavirus tests were no longer reimbursed by central government (just 
over  -€1 billion).
Central government refunds for hospitals’ increased energy costs fell by €3 billion 
to €1 billion. 
At 6%, the SHI scheme’s expenditure saw much stronger growth than its revenue. 
The health fund’s special payments fell sharply: its pandemic-related payments expired  
and there was a significant reduction in its energy crisis-related payments to hospitals. 
By contrast, health insurance institutions’ expenditure rose sharply, by 7½%. However, 
growth in spending on benefits was even stronger, reaching 8%. There was a sharp rise 
primarily in expenditure on the major items hospital treatment (+9%) and pharmaceuti-
cals (+10%), but also in spending on remedies and therapeutic appliances (+8%). Admin-
istrative expenditure grew by ½%. The discontinuation of pension provisions of just 
over €½ billion had an alleviating effect. After adjustment for this factor, administrative 
expenditure increased by almost 5½%.
2.1.2 Outlook for 2025
For 2025, government plans aimed for a roughly balanced result in the SHI scheme, 
with a sharp rise in supplementary contribution rates.  Based on the assumptions 
made by the group of  estimators in autumn 2024, contribution receipts would see a SHI
steep rise of 5%. Owing to the expiry of the inflation compensation bonus, earnings 
subject to compulsory contributions will grow more strongly than wages. The health 
fund’s transfers to the health insurance institutions are set to increase by 4%. Health 
insurance institutions’ spending on benefits is expected to rise by 7% compared with 
the estimated annual result for 2024. On this basis, the Federal Ministry of Health calcu-
lated a notional supplementary contribution rate of 2.5% to cover expenditure. This 
constituted an increase of 0.7 percentage point compared with the actual annual 

Commentaries: Economic conditions and Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 19average rate in 2024. However, the fact that the health fund pays around €1 billion 
from its liquidity reserve to the innovation fund and the hospital structures fund over 
and above the figures projected by the group of  estimators adds to the burden on SHI
the overall result derived on this basis.
As things stand, it is likely that the outturn for 2025 will be more favourable and 
that a small surplus will be recorded by the SHI scheme.  The health fund’s deficit will 
probably be higher if the increase in earnings subject to compulsory contributions is 
somewhat weaker than assumed – as it is in the Bundesbank’s Forecast. Nonetheless, 
the health insurance institutions are set to record a significant surplus, with which their 
reserves are to be brought back up to their minimum. There was a gap of €3 billion in 
these reserves at the end of 2024. Developments this year are based on the higher-
than-estimated expenditure of the health insurance institutions from last year. If this 
base effect is extrapolated, this results in a cash deficit of €2 billion. However, the 
health insurance institutions raised the supplementary contribution rate to 2.9% on 
average, and thus by 0.4 percentage point more than was calculated by the Federal 
Ministry of Health. This results in additional revenue of €5½ billion compared with the 
government figure.
2.2 Public long-term care insurance scheme

will replace the now-expired inflation compensation bonus. More importantly, however, 
the contribution rate was raised by 0.2 percentage point at the beginning of the year,

Sound public finances, stronger investment: a proposal to reform the debt brake
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 24Germany is facing major challenges. The international setting has evolved, and climate 
change and the digital transformation require us to adapt. This is highly demanding, but it 
presents opportunities as well. Government and fiscal policy have to address a wide range of 
issues, including the challenges posed by demographic change as well as the need to make 
up for shortcomings in terms of infrastructure and defence.
Fiscal policy has an important role to play in safeguarding and strengthening favourable 
business conditions. These include sound public finances, which build confidence in a 
country and are essential for it to be resilient against crises. In addition, they help monetary 
policymakers to maintain price stability. The debt brake has served its purpose in the past: it 
played a part in keeping public finances sound and ensuring compliance with the relevant EU
rules. However, this does not mean that it cannot be developed further in light of past experi-
ence and changes in the underlying conditions, provided that it continues to perform the 
basic functions for which it was created. 
This article presents an updated version of the reform proposals put forward by the Bundes-
bank in 2022. These new proposals take account of the  fiscal rules that have since been EU
amended as well as the greater challenges in terms of infrastructure and defence, though 
they are, of course, unable to take into account discussions that are still ongoing at the  EU
level. Now as then, these proposals have sound public finances as their objective. They are 
centred on the 60 % reference value for the debt ratio enshrined in the  Treaties. They EU
differ from the existing debt brake rules in that they envisage greater scope for borrowing, 
though much of this is reserved for additional fixed asset formation. The proposals mainly 
concern central government’s debt brake, but the additional investment needs of state and 
local government are also taken into account. Other elements of the proposals are designed 
to facilitate steady fiscal policymaking without weakening the binding effect of the rules. 
The proposed reform can play a role in overcoming the current challenges. It remains 
crucial, however, for government to gear its fiscal policy priorities decisively towards the 
specific challenges that we face today. This would entail reviewing its revenue and expendi-
ture as well as making efficient use of its funds. 

Sound public finances, stronger investment: a proposal to reform the debt brake
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 251 The reform proposal at a glance
The Bundesbank presented proposals for reforming central government’s debt 
brake back in 2022. These proposals are developed further in this article. Now as 
then, it remains crucial for the debt brake to safeguard sound public finances.  At the 
same time, the proposals take account of the reformed  fiscal rules. They expand the EU
scope for borrowing and now have a greater focus on the 60 % reference value for the 
debt ratio enshrined in the  Treaties. In addition, the proposals specifically reserve EU
borrowing scope for additional fixed asset formation as a way of strengthening infra-
structure and defence (more details on additionality and definitions can be found in the 
section entitled “ ”). Other aspects support the objective of Strengthening investment
steady fiscal policymaking and help to ensure the binding effect and transparency for 
the federal states’ debt brakes as well. In order to implement the reform proposals, 
Germany’s Basic Law ( ) would need to be amended.  Grundgesetz
At their core, the new proposals envisage higher ceilings for structural net borrow-
ing – above all for more government investment.  These ceilings would vary depend-
ing on whether the debt ratio is above or below 60 %. In addition, a fixed portion of the 
scope for borrowing would be reserved for more government investment. If the debt 
ratio is above 60 %, the ceiling must be determined such that it brings the debt ratio 
back below 60 %. In this case, the scope for borrowing would therefore be smaller, 
though not to the detriment of the portion reserved for investment. In this way, the 
proposals concerning the borrowing ceiling aim to safeguard sound public finances 
and the core of the  fiscal rules.EU 1)

make full use of the fiscal space provided under the national rules.1 For the earlier proposals, see  Deutsche Bundesbank  (2022).

Sound public finances, stronger investment: a proposal to reform the debt brake
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 26Supplementary elements aim to improve the transparency of public finances, 
strengthen the binding effect of the debt brake and provide support for steady 
fiscal policymaking.  On the one hand, the debt brake needs to be effective in its imple-
mentation if it is to safeguard sound public finances. On the other hand, it needs to 
facilitate steady fiscal policymaking at the same time. Central and state governments 
should apply uniform approaches based on the national accounts in cases where they 
exclude transactions or entities from their debt brakes. Ultimately, only acquisitions of 
recoverable financial assets (i.e. financial transactions) and entities that are sufficiently 
non-governmental in nature (unlike off-budget entities, which belong to the govern-
ment sector) should be excluded. Linking the rules closely to the national accounts 
would make them more transparent and more effective. Steady fiscal policymaking 
means, not least, avoiding the need for abrupt and procyclical consolidation wherever 
possible. This concern is addressed, in particular, by the proposals regarding cyclical 
adjustment and the reserves.  While such elements are indeed somewhat more 
demanding in terms of their design and application, they do follow transparent and 
comprehensible accounting rules. From the Bundesbank’s perspective, elements like 
these would round out a reform.
The current constitutional requirement to draw up amortisation plans for 
emergency borrowing could be weakened or omitted in future.  To anchor the debt 
ratio at 60 %, the Bundesbank is proposing that the borrowing ceiling would be lower 
when the debt ratio is higher than 60 % (see above). To this extent, additional rules 
governing the repayment of emergency borrowing would be less of a priority, in the 
Bundesbank’s view, especially when the debt ratio is still below 60 %. Instead of 
omitting mandatory repayment plans altogether, these could also be limited to 
instances when the debt ratio is above 60 %. 4) 
4 As of 2025, one advance in terms of steady fiscal policymaking has been made concerning interest expendi-
ture in the central government budget. Premia and discounts are now to be recognised on an accruals basis, 
which makes interest expenditure considerably less volatile.

Sound public finances, stronger investment: a proposal to reform the debt brake
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 27For a stability-oriented monetary union, it is vital that Germany, in its capacity as a 
fiscal anchor, consistently complies with EU rules. It would make sense to assign the 
key role for this within Germany to central government.  This would be conditional, of 
course, on the national rules preventing the other levels of government from accumu-
lating new debt to any significant degree. This approach makes sense for two reasons. 
First, central government would, in future, probably exert a significant influence over 
which specific  requirements apply to Germany (ownership). This is because a key EU
element of the new  fiscal rules are multi-year fiscal plans negotiated by Member EU
State governments and the European Commission. In this respect, they significantly 
strengthen the role of central government. Depending on how consistently the other 
levels of government are able to comply with their relatively tight budgetary rules, 
central government can independently take any remaining action needed to satisfy  EU
requirements. Second,  rules are highly complex and subject to interpretation. This EU
makes it difficult for entities not involved in the negotiations to identify exactly what 
action needs to be taken. Another aspect of a coherent overall concept is that new 
borrowing at the  level should be counted towards the debt brake going forward.EU
The reform proposals expand the scope for borrowing. However, if the debt ratio is 
above 60 %, the scope is reserved for investment, which is why there is a greater 
need for adjustment for the consumption portion of budgets initially.  The quantita-
tive presentation of the proposed debt brake shown in the penultimate section illus-
trates the changes in the scope for borrowing depending on the level of the debt ratio. 
That part of this article also provides a comparison with the rule as it currently stands 
as well as possible  requirements.EU

The history of the reform debate 
The current debt brake helped to gradually bring the debt ratio back down to the 
60 % reference value in the EU Treaties.  The debt brake was adopted in 2009. It 
entered into force with effect from the 2011 financial year, with a transitional period 
ending in 2015 for central government; the federal states transposed complementary 
provisions into their own laws. The debt brake was approved in light of the significant 
increase in the debt ratio expected in the wake of the financial and economic crisis in 
2008 and 2009. At the same time, the decision reflected knowledge born from experi-
ence: the borrowing limits applied up to that point were insufficient. These generally 
restricted new borrowing to being used for financing investment. However, the concept 
of “investment” and the exceptions from the borrowing rules were broadly defined, and 
there was no requirement to check compliance with the limits set by these rules when 
drawing up the accounts for a fiscal year. The rules therefore had little binding effect 
and did not prevent the debt ratio from gradually rising over the decades. Since 2011, 
however, the general government deficit and debt ratio as well as central government’s 
net borrowing have been trending downwards. The fiscal balance was even positive for 
a few years, and in 2019 the debt ratio fell back below the threshold of 60 % before the 
outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. This trend reversal was supported by a 
favourable macroeconomic environment and low interest rates, but the debt brake is 
likely to have played an important role here.

Sound public finances, stronger investment: a proposal to reform the debt brake
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 29The debt brake enabled Germany to respond to the coronavirus pandemic and the 
energy crisis on a large scale.  Thanks to its low debt ratio and credible debt brake, 
Germany was also able to obtain funds in the capital market at very cheap rates, by 
international standards. The escape clause of the debt brake enabled crisis-related 
borrowing that went far beyond the standard limit.  However, the repayment plans to 
be decided upon when the escape clause is invoked provide for repayments that start 
in 2028 and 2031 respectively and extend over 31 years. The annual repayment 
burdens from emergency borrowing reach almost €11 billion between 2031 and 2058. 
After the crises, extensive reserves made it easier for central government to return 
to the standard net borrowing limit, but only temporarily.  Federal legislators had 
planned to use extensive emergency borrowing only in subsequent budgetary years. 
However, the Federal Constitutional Court put a stop to this with its ruling of Novem-
ber 2023. As a result, federal legislators withdrew reserves of around €250 billion from 
emergency borrowing. For 2023, they invoked the escape clause again. According to 
the latest information on current planning, the last residual funds in central govern-
ment’s reserves (particularly from the surpluses created in the years 2015 to 2019) are 
to be used up this year. In subsequent years, it will be correspondingly more challeng-
ing to balance the budget under the debt brake.
In view of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, central government also set 
up the Armed Forces Fund, the expiry of which will generate strong fiscal pressure.  
In 2022, a total credit facility of €100 billion was enshrined in the Basic Law for this 
special fund, beyond the limits of the debt brake. Following net borrowing of €17 billion 
in 2024, €77 billion remained in the fund. The Federal Government expects this to be 
exhausted by the end of 2027. Thereafter, defence expenditure would have to be fully 
financed under the debt brake again. The Federal Government placed the additional 
annual burden at around €30 billion. The planned redemptions of additional loans (just 
over €3 billion per year from 2031 onwards) and interest expenditure will then also 
have to be financed under the debt brake.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 302 Higher borrowing ceilings, staggered according to the 
level of the debt ratio
The reform proposals envisage a staggered ceiling for structural net borrowing 
under central government’s debt brake.  The ceiling would depend on whether the 
debt ratio is above or below 60 %. This turns the 60 % reference value from the  EU
Treaties into the principal anchor of the debt brake. It is also in line with the reformed
 rules’ objective of ensuring resilient and sound government finances by giving EU
greater consideration to this reference value. 
Specifically, the following ceilings could apply to central government’s structural net 
borrowing: 
1.4 % of GDP  if the debt ratio is below 60 %.  Of this, 0.5 % of  would be a “low- GDP
debt base”. This would not be earmarked for any particular purpose. A further 
0.9 % of  would be an investment component for additional investment GDP
expenditure, i.e. for a higher government investment ratio than under the status 
quo (for more details, see the section entitled “ ”).  Strengthening investment
0.9 % of  GDP  if the debt ratio is above 60 %.  The investment component would 
remain, but the 0.5 % base would no longer be available. The aim here is to swiftly 
reduce the debt ratio through the more ambitious cap on borrowing without 
restricting the scope for investment as well.  

Sound public finances, stronger investment: a proposal to reform the debt brake
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 31On the one hand, these ceilings are higher than under the status quo, which has 
a ceiling of 0.35 % of  irrespective of the level of debt. On the other hand, GDP
they are narrower in terms of their substance, as the scope for borrowing would 
be reserved either largely or entirely for additional investment.
With these ceilings on structural net borrowing, compliance with the 60 % reference 
value for the debt ratio should be safeguarded quite reliably.  Social security funds 
are not permitted to accumulate any debt at all, state governments are not permitted 
to accumulate any further structural debt, and local government borrowing is tightly 
limited by state government budget rules. A structural general government deficit ratio 
of almost 1½ % should stabilise the debt ratio at just below 60 %. If the debt ratio is 
above 60 %, the more ambitious borrowing ceiling for central government aims to 
bring it back below 60 %, even if growth in nominal gross domestic product is only 
comparatively weak.  5) 
5 This is calculated excluding the Armed Forces Fund. The borrowing scope of the Armed Forces Fund is not 
allocated to individual years and is not comparable in this respect, but is planned to be fully utilised in the 
medium term in any event. Last year, the planned net borrowing by the fund amounted to 0.48 % of  Central GDP .
government’s budgeted scope for borrowing was thus only slightly below the proposed ceiling of 0.9 % of  GDP
when the debt ratio is above 60 %.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 32Supplementary information
Values for a staggered limit on net borrowing
Choosing the values for a staggered limit on the net borrowing of central govern-
ment is an important part of any reform.  The higher limit should, in an equilibrium 
situation, stabilise the debt ratio at slightly below 60 %. The lower limit should bring a 
debt ratio above 60 % back below that level in a reasonable timeframe. When net 
borrowing limits are lower, the debt ratio is, all else being equal, more often below 
60 %, and non-earmarked base borrowing is less frequently rendered inapplicable.  
The proposed values pull debt ratios above 60 % back below 60 %, even when 
growth is comparatively weak, and thereafter have a stabilising effect.  The Bundes-
bank currently estimates real potential growth to be only 0.4 % over the medium term.
 With a deflator of 2 %, a 1.4 % limit on the structural net borrowing ratio thus 
stabilises the debt ratio at just below 60 % (any net purchases of debt-financed financial 
assets are excluded here). In the past, the borrowing limit has never been fully 
exhausted during budget implementation in normal times (that is, without use of the 
escape clause). This was partly due, not least, to cautiously planned central government 
budgets, which are still advisable in order to avoid the immediate need for a supple-
mentary budget in the event of additional burdens. On the other hand, local govern-
ments might generate additional debt, new emergency borrowing might prove neces-
sary, potential growth might be even lower, and so on. This demonstrates the impor-
tance of the marked haircut (0.5 % of  in the structural net borrowing limit for debt GDP )
ratios above 60 %.  1) 
 2) 
1 Simulations, such as those provided by the German Council of Economic Experts (2024), can help to select 
values. In the Council’s proposal, however, the scope for borrowing is not earmarked for specific purposes. By 
contrast, the Bundesbank’s proposals tie borrowing scope to investment, in the sense of a golden rule. They 
aim to ensure that additional debt is initially offset by a greater volume of non-financial assets and that 
growth potential is strengthened (see section 3. “ ”). Strengthening investment
2 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2024b).

Sound public finances, stronger investment: a proposal to reform the debt brake
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 33At the same time, the values are guided by the new EU rules, the requirements of 
which cannot be accurately estimated and may therefore require adjustments  (see 
the section entitled “ ”). Previously, even  requirements additionally need to be metEU
with a debt ratio of below 60 % and a deficit ratio of below 3 %, a medium-term 
budgetary objective for the structural general government deficit ratio was consistently 
applied. The Bundesbank’s proposals in 2022 were based on this. The newly proposed 
higher net borrowing limit of 1.4 % has been chosen in view of factors including the 
simplified procedure that will apply when the  reference values are complied with: EU
the limit will then be within the range expected for the structural target deficit ratio for 
the final year of the fiscal plans. Higher debt ratios are expected to result in signifi-
cantly lower target deficit ratios. It is therefore also important to emphasise that the  EU
rules must be complied with in addition to the debt brake. As would in fact have been 
possible previously, consolidation measures may therefore be necessary, even though 
compliance with the debt brake has been achieved without them.
Overall, the proposed net borrowing limits make the 60 % reference value the 
anchor for the debt ratio and should be compatible with the new EU rules.  An even 
more cautious design with correspondingly lower limits could be considered in order to 
shorten the length of time spent with a debt ratio above 60 % and to further safeguard 
the anchoring effect. Higher values do not appear advisable if only because the 
proposed values are already likely to almost completely exhaust the scope set by  EU
requirements (see the section entitled " ”).  requirements additionally need to be metEU
Ultimately, it is up to legislators to weigh up the arguments and set the limits. Since the 
appropriate level of the limit values also depends on the nominal trend rate of  GDP
growth, it makes sense to periodically review the assumptions underlying the limit 
values and thus their adequacy.

Sound public finances, stronger investment: a proposal to reform the debt brake
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 343 Strengthening investment
The new investment component of the debt brake is intended to help government 
expand its investment and stabilise it at a higher level. There is broad consensus that 
Germany needs to invest more in its public capital, such as infrastructure and defence.
It has been shown that central, state and local governments tend to defer invest- 
ment rather than consumption spending. This likewise suggests that financial 
resources should be specifically ring-fenced for investment. With this aim in mind, the 
proposals tie the structural scope for net borrowing by central government in the 
amount of 0.9 % of  to additional investment. This is intended to help boost infra- GDP
structure and defence spending and stabilise it at a higher level. 
The investment component should also finance central government grants for 
additional investment by state and local governments.  State and local govern-
ments account for a large share of infrastructure expenditure.  Specifically, one-third 
of the investment component for central government could be reserved for investment 
grants to state governments.  The state governments could also use these central 
government funds to disburse investment grants to their respective local governments. 
Investment grants of 0.3 % of  would correspond to around €15 billion, or one-fifth GDP
of the current fixed asset formation by state and local governments. Central and state 
governments could also spend a portion of the funds on digitalisation projects 
standardised at the national level. There is an apparent need to make up for shortcom-
ings in this area, too. 6) 
 7) 
 8) 
 9) 
6 Procurement of weapons systems can ultimately be regarded as fixed asset formation (as in the national 
accounts and unlike in budget plans and government finance statistics).
7  The proposal aims to help the federal states gear their budgets towards investment while maintaining the 
fundamental ban on new borrowing for the federal states under the Basic Law. As an alternative to investment 
grants (or a part thereof) from central government, state governments could be given a constitutional authori-
sation to borrow. One argument against this idea is that some federal states are already burdened with very 
high levels of debt and, in some cases, have to manage local governments with sizeable cash advances. 
8 According to the government finance statistics, state and local governments accounted for four-fifths of total 
government expenditure on fixed asset formation in 2023.
9 This could, for example, be allocated among the federal states according to population.

Sound public finances, stronger investment: a proposal to reform the debt brake
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 35There is a strong case for avoiding too broad a definition of the term “investment”.
For example, the investment component could be limited to fixed asset formation 
 (including military procurement) at the central, state and local government levels.
However, it is not just the core budgets that should be considered here. For example, 
as the rail networks are paid for by off-budget entities belonging to the general govern-
ment sector as defined in the national accounts, investment in these networks should 
be included. By contrast, the financing of investment grants to private sector firms via 
the investment component should not be permitted. Under certain circumstances, legis- 
lators could additionally set fixed shares for individual categories (e.g. a specific 
percentage of  for investment in military equipment). GDP
For ease of implementation, the proposal regarding the definition of investment 
that is eligible for credit financing is no longer aimed at net government investment.
It would technically make sense to tie credit financing to growth in government non-fi-
nancial assets. Thus, credit financing would have to be tied to net investment (i.e. gross 
investment less depreciation), which was an argument made by the Bundesbank in 
2022 with regard to general government. However, it is important to acknowledge that 
this approach is not easily applicable to individual state or local governments.  Even 
for central government, it is difficult to plan net investment when preparing the 
budget. In particular, depreciation in the national accounts is based on replacement 
values and is therefore heavily dependent on sectoral price developments. As a 
pragmatic alternative, the Bundesbank therefore proposes using figures for fixed asset 
formation by general government set out in line with the budgetary definition and, 
above all, safeguarding the additionality of spending in each case.  10) 
10 No figures for these are published in the national accounts. Balance sheet data are only available for entities 
that use commercial double-entry accounting, which also record transactions under varying federal state law.

Sound public finances, stronger investment: a proposal to reform the debt brake
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 36Credit financing should be permitted for investment if it increases the associated 
investment ratio relative to a base value (condition of additionality).  To this end, it 
would be appropriate for the level of central government investment to be oriented 
around a level of investment from the recent past (expenditure financed via the Armed 
Forces Fund could be excluded, as otherwise it would be unnecessarily difficult to fulfil 
the criterion of additionality). This level would have to be set in relation to nominal 
potential  This ratio, e.g. for 2024 (or an average of the last three years, for GDP .
example), would be the base ratio.  As part of its investment component, central 
government would then be permitted to finance investment through borrowing if and 
insofar as it raises the given defined investment ratio for the respective year above the 
base ratio. Therefore, in this regard, credit-financed investment must be additional and 
cannot simply replace investment financed via the budget. State governments, too, 
would have to demonstrate that, with credit-financed funds for investment purposes 
from central government, they can correspondingly raise a similar investment ratio for 
their own and their local governments’ fixed asset formation.  A federal state would 
request the funds on the basis of budget plans, while final settlement would ultimately 
be based on the investment ratios. State governments could apply the same procedure 
to the grants that they pass on to their respective local governments.
The rules do not stipulate a specific level of government investment.  First, central 
and state governments are also able to expand their investment to a markedly greater 
degree if they deem this to be necessary. However, they would not be able to finance 
this investment through additional debt because central government’s structural net 
borrowing remains capped (and structural net borrowing at the state government level 
is prohibited). Second, central and state governments would not have to borrow or 
draw on borrowed funds if, at a given point in time, they assessed the need for invest-
ment to be lower. 11) 
 12) 
 13) 
11 According to data from the national accounts, net fixed asset formation for general government (after deduct-
ing procurements financed via the Armed Forces Fund) was slightly negative in 2024. A subsequent credit-fi-
nanced increase in the investment ratio of 0.9 percentage point would, at first, be almost fully reflected in 
positive net investment. Over time, however, the growing write-downs on credit-financed investment would 
lead to a decline in the net investment ratio. Nevertheless, this ratio, and especially the ratio of capital stock to
 would remain higher over the long term than in the base year of 2024. GDP ,
12 In the case of the federal states, relative population developments would also have to be taken into account: 
a federal state’s base ratio would be lower (i.e. less ambitious) if its share of the total population were to fall.
13 It cannot be ruled out that central government could, in reality, limit its investment expenditure in order to 
keep the debt ratio below 60 % and thereby retain its scope for borrowing without restrictions on its use. It 
would be necessary to monitor this.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 37In order for the investment component to actually have a positive impact, it is 
crucial to reduce non-financial barriers to investment and invest funds efficiently at 
the same time.  For example, there are bottlenecks, some of which are persistent, on 
transport routes. It is essential that these be resolved. There appears to be some room 
for improvement with respect to planning and approval processes as well as the execu-
tion and monitoring of investment projects. This applies, not least, to legal proceed-
ings, which often entail lengthy delays. In recent years, central, state and local govern-
ments had financial leeway, but they did not use it sufficiently to make up for lagging 
fixed asset formation. In this respect, the catching-up that needs to be done is not a 
result of the borrowing ceiling under the current debt brake, and greater budgetary 
scope for investment would, on its own, probably not be enough to quickly close this 
gap. 

Sound public finances, stronger investment: a proposal to reform the debt brake
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 384 Elements supporting steadier fiscal policy
In the proposal, the scope for borrowing narrows if the debt ratio is above 60 %. The 
idea is for the staggered ceiling to be designed in such a way that budget planning 
and implementation are as steady as possible, even at this reference value.  In order 
to be permitted to use the additional scope (base borrowing) for the forthcoming 
budget, it could suffice if the debt ratio (1) were below 60 % in the year preceding the 
preparation of the budget or (2) would be below 60 % in the coming year according to 
an independently certified government forecast. By contrast, base borrowing would 
not be available if the 60 % reference value had been exceeded in the past and were 
likely to be exceeded in the future. This would therefore not come as a surprise and, 
instead, fiscal policy could prepare for it. Regardless, it would be advisable for fiscal 
policy to maintain a certain safety margin against the 60 % reference value. By doing 
so, fluctuations in the debt ratio – owing to cyclical weakness, for example – would not 
result in the reference value then being exceeded.
To support steady fiscal policy, central government could also add an error compo-
nent to its cyclical adjustment. This would mean that unexpected developments 
would need to be corrected only after a time lag.  The Bundesbank already proposed 
this back in 2022.   With an error component, unexpected negative developments 
would not need to be corrected immediately, but only after a time lag (and unexpected 
positive developments would open up additional scope only after a time lag). This facili-
tates steady budget planning, and the deficit would thus tend to develop countercycli-
cally. The  fiscal rules also make allowance for unexpected developments in tax EU
revenue. 14) 
 15) 
 16) 
14 The borrowing ceilings are based on structural values. Cyclical fluctuations are therefore taken into account, 
in principle, via cyclical adjustment: taken in isolation, a good cyclical situation reduces the permissible level of 
unadjusted net borrowing, whilst a poor situation increases it. In this way, and via gross domestic product, 
cyclical fluctuations also affect the debt ratio.
15 See Bundesbank (2022) and  . Kremer et al. (2023)
16 The  requirements under  fiscal rules are set out in plans for periods of four to seven years. These plans EU EU
relate to growth in net expenditure (less the impact of revenue-side legislative changes). Unexpected develop-
ments on the revenue side play no role to this extent. As the plans run for quite long periods of time, 
unexpected shortfalls in revenue can thus lead to budgetary imbalances. The Bundesbank’s proposal avoids 
this by means of adjustment rules.

Sound public finances, stronger investment: a proposal to reform the debt brake
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 39Reserves can also support steady fiscal policy.  A reform could stipulate that central 
government use borrowing authorisations that have not been used for payments 
(insofar as they are under the borrowing ceilings) to fill reserves. By making subse-
quent withdrawals from these reserves, it can then, over time, make full use of its 
borrowing scope to the extent permitted by the debt brake, taking account of the 
additional safeguard of the 60 % reference value (see the following section for more 
information). In other words, reserves of this nature do not run counter to the objective 
of effectively limiting debt. A certain degree of flexibility over a multi-year period is also 
consistent with  rules, which use a control account to record deviations above or EU
below the net expenditure path during the planning period. 
Central government should not be able to use the reserves to undermine the two 
fundamental principles of the borrowing ceilings:  first, that scope for borrowing is 
tied to specific purposes and, second, that base borrowing is no longer available when 
the debt ratio is above 60 %. 
In order to ensure that borrowing remains earmarked for specific purposes, 
central government could differentiate between reserves that are unrestricted in 
their use, consisting of unused base borrowing, and reserves tied to investment, 
consisting of unused investment borrowing. Amounts that exceed the respective 
borrowing ceilings during budget implementation could then be recorded on 
separate control accounts. 
The reserves are not financial assets, but instead scope for borrowing that has 
not yet been taken up in the credit market. A withdrawal from the reserves there-
fore entails a correspondingly higher debt ratio: if the debt ratio is above 60 %, 
this would not be in keeping with the staggered borrowing ceiling. Therefore, a 
further condition, at least for the use of reserves that consist of base borrowing, 
appears warranted: the debt ratio, factoring in the planned use of reserves, 
should be required to be below the reference value according to a certified projec-
tion.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 405 Further elements of the reform
5.1 Rethinking repayment rules for emergency borrowing
The obligation of central government to adopt repayment plans for emergency 
borrowing (and for the debt of the Armed Forces Fund) could cease to apply or only 
apply to a limited extent. At present, the Basic Law stipulates that amortisation plans 
must be adopted for emergency borrowing. This rule is intended to ensure that, over 
time, debt returns to the path permitted by the borrowing ceiling. The proposals 
presented here follow a different approach. In line with the  Treaties, they are based EU
on the 60 % reference value as a key anchor for ensuring a sufficiently sound position. 
They therefore calibrate the borrowing ceilings such that a debt ratio above 60 % 
relatively reliably falls back below 60 %; for this reason, base borrowing in the amount 
of 0.5 % of  is then no longer available. Repayment plans would thus be unneces- GDP
sary, and they are also not required with respect to  rules. However, the repayment EU
rule for emergency borrowing could play a role in returning below the 60 % reference 
value more quickly. An interim solution would be to dispense with the repayment 
requirement only if the debt ratio is (back) below the 60 % reference value.
If, however, central government receives back funds for crisis measures that it had 
previously financed through emergency borrowing, it should be required to use 
these return flows for repayments.  This scenario materialised in 2024: central govern-
ment received repayments of crisis assistance funds that it had granted in previous 
years and had financed using emergency borrowing. It makes sense to use such repay-

ment could misuse emergency borrowing in subsequent years to close gaps in the 
budget or to finance additional expenditure.

Sound public finances, stronger investment: a proposal to reform the debt brake
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 415.2 Defining financial transactions and entities included in the debt 
brake consistent with the national accounts
The proposal significantly raises the ceilings for structural net borrowing.  This is 
another reason why it is advisable, in return, to reduce discretionary scope that runs 
counter to the binding effect of the debt brake. For example, the draft central govern-
ment budget for 2025 envisaged converting investment grants to Deutsche Bahn into 
capital injections (financial transaction). This raised questions from an economic 
perspective.  
Against this backdrop, central and state governments should define financial trans-
actions and entities to be included in their debt brakes in addition to the core 
budget in a way that is consistent with the national accounts.  The national accounts 
are a good point of reference, as they capture transactions and entities in a way that is 
economically well-founded. They delineate deficit-neutral shifts in government financial 
assets more reliably, and the  fiscal rules also use this as a foundation. At present, EU
central government and the individual state governments adjust their borrowing 
ceilings very differently in some cases when it comes to financial transactions. In 
addition, they also define the group of entities included (e.g. public undertakings 
belonging to the general government sector) very differently. This limits transparency 
and, under certain circumstances, burdens are simply “outsourced” away from the 
relevant debt brake. Financial transactions (e.g. capital injections) should therefore only 
be excluded from the debt brakes if they are recorded in the national accounts as 
having a deficit-neutral overall effect; this does not apply to transfers to offset losses or 
capped investment grants. In addition, all entities that belong to the general govern-
ment sector in the national accounts should also be subject to the debt brakes. By 
contrast, public undertakings that are part of the private sector in the national accounts 
would not need to be included in the debt brake.  17)

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 425.3 Making central government responsible for compliance with  EU
rules
It remains essential to ensure that Germany complies with the EU fiscal rules along-
side its national fiscal rules.  This supports a stable monetary union and a stability-ori-
ented monetary policy. If Germany strictly applies the  rules to its own finances, it EU
can credibly advocate for others to do the same. This is of key importance given the 
very high debt and deficit ratios in the euro area in some cases. At around 90 %, the 
debt ratio for the euro area as a whole is currently only 5 percentage points lower than 
at the height of the euro area debt crisis in 2014. Excluding Germany, the average debt 
ratio is as high as 100 %. Moreover, there is no reduction in sight in the short term. This 
is particularly true of the especially highly indebted countries Belgium, France and Italy, 
which have deficits that are still well above 3 % in some cases.
To ensure compliance with the EU fiscal rules, Germany’s national fiscal surveillance 
must be effective.  This holds, in particular, if central government’s debt brake no 
longer provides a substantial safety margin against the  requirements for general EU
government (see the section entitled “ ”).  requirements additionally need to be metEU  
At present, budgetary surveillance is primarily organised via the Stability Council, but 
implementation is patchy. The Bundesbank and the Independent Advisory Board to the 
Stability Council have submitted proposals on how the surveillance of general govern-
ment finances in connection with the debt brakes could be improved. 18)

Sound public finances, stronger investment: a proposal to reform the debt brake
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 43There is much to suggest that central government should assume responsibility 
within general government for Germany’s compliance with the EU rules.  This would 
entail central government adjusting its budget to comply with the  rules, if neces-EU
sary – even if this means overfulfilling the requirements of its own debt brake. Under 
the new  rules, annual requirements are formulated on the basis of general govern-EU
ment expenditure growth. There are two arguments in favour of giving central govern-
ment responsibility within general government for Germany’s compliance with the  EU
rules. First, central government already holds this responsibility in Germany’s external 
relations, i.e. with the  Second, central government is likely, in future, to exert a EU.
significant influence over which specific  requirements apply to Germany (owner-EU
ship): it negotiates the ceilings with the European Commission. Central, state and local 
governments also consider it difficult to attribute breaches of the expenditure growth 
ceilings to individual levels of government. The proposal could circumvent this difficul-
ty. 
Greater central government responsibility necessitates effective rules at the other 
levels of government.  This would be supported, amongst other things, by the afore-
mentioned recommendations on financial transactions and entities included under the 
debt brake as well as on budgetary surveillance. If the other levels of government are 
at risk of failing to comply with their obligations, they are individually subject to the 
consolidation requirement. It would also be highly desirable for the state governments 
to harmonise their debt brakes and use, for example, a uniform procedure for cyclical 
adjustment. The current disparity in the methods they apply is a substantial impediment 
to the transparency of state government finances.

Sound public finances, stronger investment: a proposal to reform the debt brake
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 44Central government might need to respond fairly quickly to ensure general govern-
ment compliance with the EU rules.  Extensive, short-term spending cuts are more diffi-
cult if investment is to remain at a similarly high level and expenditure is already well 
prioritised. In this situation, adjustments on the revenue side are the more obvious 
instrument for an initial short-term response. The state governments are entitled to a 
say in the major levies and, like local governments, receive their portion of any 
additional revenue. If central government is solely responsible for ensuring compliance 
with the  rules, it would therefore be worth considering the option of providing it EU
with a flexible revenue instrument that distributes burdens relatively broadly. This 
could, for example, take the form of a temporary right to impose a surcharge on joint 
taxes for this specific purpose.  The additional revenue would flow to central govern-
ment alone, and the financial distribution of regular revenue from joint taxes between 
central, state and local governments would remain unchanged. To prevent the 
surcharge on joint taxes from becoming entrenched, it could be constitutionally limited 
in duration (e.g. to two years) and in size. Central government would have to use this 
limited timeframe to achieve sustainable consolidation should the pressure to do so 
persist. This could then also include expenditure that is not available for adjustment in 
the short term.
5.4 Taking account of level debtEU-
It would be logical for the debt brake to take account of EU-level debt incurred to 
fund transfers and other expenditure affecting the deficit.  The  fiscal rules focus EU
on national public finances. This makes sense provided that there are no sizeable 
deficits or debt at the  level. Otherwise, however, the national fiscal rules are at risk EU
of being overly narrow and failing to fulfil their actual objective. In  the  NGEU , EU
already has a temporary but extensive debt-financed programme that also funds trans-
fers. A number of other debt programmes are also being brought into play. In future, 
the debt brake should therefore take equal account of European and national debt: it is 
intended to effectively limit Member States’ debt burdens irrespective of the level at 
which such debt is incurred. 19) 
19 The German Council of Economic Experts’ proposal to reform the debt ceiling prior to the introduction of the 
debt brake also contained a surcharge payable to central government (“debt solidarity surcharge”). This was 
intended to compensate for longer-lasting ceiling breaches on the control account. See German Council of 
Economic Experts (2007), pp. 115 ff.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 45The change should apply to any future EU debt programmes. For these, Germany’s 
financial share in  borrowing for deficit-affecting disbursements (notably including EU
transfers) would then have to be deducted in the respective year from the debt brake 
borrowing ceiling. And, in principle, the debt brake’s 60 % trigger would have to be 
calculated incorporating such future  debt. EU

Sound public finances, stronger investment: a proposal to reform the debt brake
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 466 Legal anchoring
The proposed reform would necessitate very broad support in the Bundestag and 
the Bundesrat because it would require Germany’s Basic Law to be amended.  The 
approval of two-thirds of the members of the Bundestag and two-thirds of the votes in 
the Bundesrat would be needed. This applies, for example, to the new borrowing 
ceilings, the repeal of the repayment plan requirement or the shift in responsibility 
within general government for compliance with the  rules. In addition, secondary EU
laws would need to be amended, too. 
A reform would also require a decision regarding the extent to which new provi-
sions should be enshrined in constitutional law.  Doing so would offer a high level of 
protection, as reversing the changes would then only be possible with broad majorities. 
Furthermore, eligible parties would have recourse to the Federal Constitutional Court 
should they fear that legislators are undermining the rules in their practical application. 
With regard to the reform proposals, it would also make sense for the additionality of 
debt-financed investment to be enshrined in the Basic Law. Besides sufficiently protect-
ing the reform objectives, it would be important, at the same time, to ensure that 
future legislators are not hamstrung by very detailed, and partly technical, elements of 
the debt brake in the constitution.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 477 Special funds as an alternative to fundamental reform
A debt-financed special fund could be an alternative to a fundamental reform of the 
debt brake, but it would also have a number of disadvantages.  A (potentially tempo-
rary) special fund can be viewed as a way of leaving the core of the existing debt brake 
unchanged as far as possible, thus making it easier to implement. However, a funda-
mental reform of the debt brake would have the prospect of long-term viability, thus 
affording greater planning certainty than a temporary special fund. Moreover, offload-
ing expenditure to the special funds is less transparent than showing all spending in 
the budget.  It is all the more important to maintain a comprehensive overview of 
central government finances due to the fact that the reform proposals will exhaust the 
scope set for general government by the reformed fiscal rules at the  level (see the EU
section entitled “ ”).   requirements additionally need to be metEU
The debt brake reform proposal presented here could be implemented in the Basic 
Law in an economically similar fashion by means of a special fund.  This special fund 
would then complement the existing (or only slightly modified) debt brake and could be 
temporary. Many of the reform elements discussed here could be taken into account. 
Even in introducing a special fund, Germany must comply with the  rules (and EU
is not permitted to fully exhaust the national scope for borrowing correspond-
ingly). 
Furthermore, it should be ensured that other central and state government 
expenditure for fixed asset formation and defence (outside of the new special 
fund) grows in line with trend : in contrast to what has been observed for the GDP
Armed Forces Fund in some instances, the governments should not shift expendi-
ture to the special fund in order to temporarily create scope for other items in the 
budget.  20) 
20 For information on the advantages and disadvantages of off-budget entities, see Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2023). Weighing up the arguments, the Bundesbank is sceptical about the growing number of off-budget 
entities such as special funds.

Sound public finances, stronger investment: a proposal to reform the debt brake
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 48In order to anchor the debt ratio below 60 %, additional changes to the debt 
brake would also have to be considered in the case of a special fund: central 
government’s current scope for structural borrowing (0.35 % of  could be GDP )
tied to the debt ratio being below the reference value for as long as the special 
fund is in place.
As things currently stand, it is becoming apparent that Germany and the other EU 
Member States will have to substantially increase their defence spending in a timely 
manner.  It is not yet clear what this means in terms of volume or timeframe. There is 
discussion at the EU level about granting Member States temporary additional scope 
for deficits in order to increase defence expenditure. Were this to be agreed, Germany 
could top up and expand the Armed Forces Fund. The reformed debt brake could then 
exist in parallel with an increased Armed Forces Fund for a period of time, and the 
underlying borrowing ceilings would not have to be temporarily adjusted. Insofar as 
the debt ratio remains higher than 60 % for longer as a result of additional borrowing 
by the special fund, base borrowing will be unavailable for a correspondingly longer 
period of time. In addition, should the need for high defence spending persist, it would 
be important at the EU level to ensure that debt ratios remain anchored by the EU fiscal 
rules. 

Sound public finances, stronger investment: a proposal to reform the debt brake
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 498 What the proposal means in quantitative terms and 
how it relates to the  rules   EU
8.1 Reform will significantly expand scope for borrowing relative to 
status quo going forward
If there is no reform, central government’s scope for deficits will remain fairly high 
to start with, but will decline significantly, particularly from 2028 onwards.  Central 
government will still be able to borrow very extensively in the Armed Forces Fund in the 
current and coming years. Furthermore, it still has considerable reserves in the core 
budget and in the Climate Fund. In the following, it is assumed that central government 
uses up these reserves by the end of 2025 and exhausts the Armed Forces Fund’s 
borrowing authorisations by the end of 2028.  Repayment obligations starting in 
2028 for emergency borrowing during the coronavirus and energy crises will also 
reduce the scope for borrowing.  
Legislators decide when and with which provisions a reform will enter into force.  For 
example, it is assumed that the proposed reform will enter into force in 2026. Legisla-
tors could also bring the reform into force at a later date, possibly in conjunction with 
transitional arrangements. It would, however, be necessary to ensure that Germany 
complies with EU requirements.
The chart below depicts the scope for central government’s structural deficit if, for 
example, the reform enters into force in 2026 with the parameters presented above. 
Here, it is assumed that the reform will abolish the Armed Forces Fund’s residual 
borrowing authorisations and the repayment requirements for its debt as well as for 
emergency borrowing. 21) 
 22) 
21 The quantifications are subject to some uncertainty. They are based on assumptions about future 
macroeconomic and fiscal developments and the interpretation of  EU rules, and draw in part on the 
Bundesbank’s December 2024 forecast; see  Deutsche Bundesbank (2024b) . 
22 In contrast to central government’s budget planning from summer 2024, the Armed Forces Fund still has 
residual borrowing authorisations of around €10 billion in the Bundesbank’s forecast for 2028.

Debt ratio > 60 % 1 2 23 36 37 99
In the example, the reform significantly increases central government’s scope for 
borrowing compared with the status quo  (see Chart 2.1). However, this scope  
depends on whether the debt ratio is above or below 60 %. If the debt ratio is lower 
than 60 %, the scope for borrowing increases by a cumulative amount of around 
€220 billion compared with the status quo up to 2030. In this case, the new borrowing 
ceiling under the reform allows for annual structural  of 1.4 % of  If net borrowing GDP .

around €100 billion higher than the status quo until 2030 in cumulative terms. It should 
be noted that, in the proposals, parts of the borrowing authorisations are reserved for 
additional investment (including investment grants to the federal states). If the debt 
ratio is higher than 60 %, then the scope for borrowing for consumption spending 
narrows markedly.


Sound public finances, stronger investment: a proposal to reform the debt brake
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 51Compared with the structural deficit of central government and its special funds in 
2024, its budgetary scope does not change substantially.  This is because central 
government was able to use extensive reserves in 2024 alongside  from net borrowing
the core budget and the Armed Forces Fund. In addition, the reform proposals aim to 
shift budgetary allocations in favour of investment expenditure. Even if the debt ratio is 
below 60 %, the scope depicted is therefore reserved, to a large extent, for investment 
(in some cases in the form of grants to the federal states) and is associated with 
elevated investment ratios. In order to be able to utilise this scope, central government 
needs to stabilise its investment in the core budget and expand defence expenditure in 
the latter somewhat further. Only then would it exceed the baseline level of investment 
described above (see the section entitled “ ”) and be able to Strengthening investment
borrow for investment purposes.
With the proposed reform, scope for borrowing will depend on whether the debt 
ratio is above or below 60 %. At present, the debt ratio is higher than 60 % and is 
approaching the ceiling. It stood at 62.4 % at the end of the third quarter of 2024. 
According to the Bundesbank’s forecast, it is set to decline to 61.7 % by the end of 
2027. This forecast is based on the fiscal status quo. The  requirements established EU
to date (and the current debt brake) are therefore likely to be breached. Assuming 
compliance with the rules, the ratio would approach the 60 % level more quickly. Gener-
ally, the development of the debt ratio depends on the deficit, nominal GDP  (in the 
denominator) and shifts in financial assets (deficit-debt adjustments).

relatively large cash reserves, for which it took out debt. Tighter reserve management 
would result in lower debt.  In addition, central government holds large-scale partici-
pating interests without exerting controlling influence. If it privatises these participat-
ing interests, it generates revenue with which debt is to be repaid in accordance with 
the provisions of the debt brake. Participating interests that central government parks 
with  are already largely recorded in the budget as having been sold. In the KfW
Maastricht debt level, however, the proceeds from  are recorded as increasing KfW
debt. By selling the parked participating interests in full, central government could 
therefore lower its debt level by their market value (given significantly lower privatisa-
tion proceeds in the budget), thus not least increasing the transparency of public 
finances. The  has also stipulated that central government must sell off most of its EU
participating interests in the energy company Uniper by 2028.
8.2  requirements additionally need to be metEU
It is not yet entirely clear how much fiscal leeway Germany will have based on the EU
rules. This depends on what medium-term fiscal plan the new Federal Government 
agrees with the European Commission and the Council. The plan will probably start in 
2025 and will run for four to seven years. As the rules leave room for negotiation in 
terms of the period that the plan should cover as well as other aspects, any estimate of 
fiscal leeway is subject to uncertainty. In addition, temporarily granting  Member EU
States additional leeway to finance higher defence expenditure is under discussion. 23) 
23 This would also be the case if liquidity management in the government sector were to be more closely coordi-
nated overall or, under certain circumstances, more concentrated at the Finance Agency. 

Sound public finances, stronger investment: a proposal to reform the debt brake
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 53The EU rules relate ex ante  to the general government deficit as defined in the 
national accounts. Unlike the debt brake, they do not target net borrowing in the 
budget. They relate not only to central government, but also include state and local 
government as well as social security funds. The national accounts rules also determine 
whether transactions must be recorded as financial and thus in a way that does not 
affect the deficit. And they determine which entities are included in the government 
sector as off-budget entities and thus do influence its deficit. In the following, an 
attempt is made to quantify future  requirements for Germany without taking into EU
account possible special rules for defence expenditure. Some of the data are based on 
the Bundesbank’s December fiscal forecast,  with the estimate of structural variables 
(see Chart based on procedures similar to those used within EU budgetary surveillance  
2.2):  
EU requirements would be most ambitious for a regular four-year plan.  In the 
final year, a fairly low structural deficit ratio (around ¾ %) would probably be 
needed to “cushion” large increases in age-related expenditure in the following 
decade as part of the  sustainability analysis.EU
Longer plans running for up to seven years are possible if Germany and the EU 
level agree on reforms. If the plan runs for a longer period, the structural 
deficit ratio can fall more slowly and somewhat less overall  (probably to around 
1 %). The reason for the somewhat higher structural target deficit ratio is that, if 
the plan ends later, a larger increase in age-related expenditure will already occur 
within the planning period (and will have to be funded within this period). Age-re-
lated expenditure will then no longer rise as sharply in the following decade. In 
the context of the  sustainability analysis, lower burdens therefore need to be EU
cushioned after the plan has ended than with a four-year plan. For the longer 
plan, this allows the structural deficit ratio to be somewhat higher when the plan 
ends than with the shorter plan.  24)

26 The European Commission’s simulations do not adequately reflect the fact that the social security funds incur 
no age-related debt. This is because additional expenditure related to an ageing population, which is what the
 rules target, leads to a rise in the contribution rate in Germany, which funds almost two-thirds of this EU
additional expenditure. See . Deutsche Bundesbank (2024c), Section 1.2

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 54The leeway is largest if the simplified procedure applies: this usually requires a 
Member State to comply with the EU reference values of 60 % (debt ratio) and 
3 % (deficit ratio) before the start of the plan.  Under the simplified procedure, 
the deficit and debt ratios must comply with the reference values over the term of 
the plan, and when the plan ends, the structural deficit ratio must be at a sustain-
able level. A range of 1¼ % to 1¾ % for the deficit ratio appears plausible in this 
case (see the horizontal shading in Chart 2.2). 
Each new Federal Government can submit a revised plan, for instance after the 
next general election, which is expected to be held in 2029. This, in turn, must be

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 55Chart 2.2 makes it clear that the reformed borrowing ceiling under the debt brake 
is, in principle, in line with probable EU requirements, but that it exploits them to a 
large degree.  It is therefore not advisable to loosen the borrowing ceiling of the debt 
brake more than proposed. Otherwise, there would be persistent potential for conflict 
between national and European requirements. Germany should avoid such potential  
for conflict. Germany must comply with  requirements irrespective of national EU
requirements. It is therefore possible that the leeway offered by the debt brake cannot 
be fully utilised. The chart depicts such a case for 2028 with a debt ratio above 60 % and 
a four-year plan for the  rules: at just over 1 % (left-hand chart), the general govern-EU
ment deficit resulting from the permissible  under the reformed debt net borrowing
brake in 2028 exceeds the ceiling in a four-year plan under  rules (right-hand chart). EU
The reform proposal for the debt brake is not aimed at fully replicating the EU rules.  
The national rules must provide fiscal policy with a binding, transparent borrowing 
ceiling. The  rules do not do this: as applied, they relate to the growth in a general EU
government expenditure variable. Consequently, the reform proposal does not directly 
tie new borrowing by central government and the individual federal states to the 
presumed  requirements. This is especially true given that the European Commission’EU
s recommendations have a considerable impact on how the rules are interpreted and 
future Federal Governments will renegotiate the requirements repeatedly. Overall, 
there is much to be said for independent national rules that ensure sound public 
finances in a reliable and verifiable manner, provide fiscal policy with clear guidelines 
and, as far as possible, avoid conflicts with  rules. This also creates confidence in EU
German public finances and ensures favourable financing terms. 

Sound public finances, stronger investment: a proposal to reform the debt brake
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 569 Conclusion: government still needs to set up future-
proof budgets
The proposed reform does not absolve central, state and local governments of the 
need to adjust their budgets in terms of consumption.  Even taking into account the 
reform proposals, both the Bundesbank’s forecast and central government’s medium-
term planning indicate a need for consolidation. The potential for deficits may be larger 
under the proposals, but mainly for additional investment. If the debt ratio exceeds 
60 %, the scope for borrowing for consumption purposes even decreases. The propos-
als, therefore, still include the need for budget adjustments. Central, state and local 
governments must also create the leeway to stabilise their investment expenditure to 
be financed without borrowed funds. 
The proposals support a clear expansion of investment. However, a certain lead 
time is probably needed if the additional funds are to be spent efficiently.  The time 
required to expand investment can be explained by the need for central, state and local 
governments to prepare, tender and implement projects. In this context, they are likely 
to encounter capacity bottlenecks in some cases, both in administrative and judicial 
terms and amongst the enterprises involved. The aim must also be to prioritise projects 
that are particularly advantageous for the economy as a whole. Moreover, additional 
government expenditure should not evaporate because capacity bottlenecks cause 
prices to rise, which is another argument for gradually building additional investment 
volume. What matters is that the reform sustainably supports higher real investment.
The reform can help to overcome the current challenges without jeopardising sound 
public finances. However, additional scope for borrowing for investment purposes is 
not sufficient.  General government’s role goes much further than that. It is crucial that  
general government aligns its priorities on the expenditure and revenue sides with the 
challenges it faces and uses the funds efficiently and in a targeted manner.

Germany

Access to cash in Germany
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 59In order for people in Germany to be able to use cash as a means of payment and store of 
value, it must be available via points of access to cash such as automated teller machines 
and bank counters. However, the number of  and bank branches in Germany has been ATMs
declining significantly for some years now. And even though, according to a Bundesbank 
public survey, the majority of the population in Germany report having an overall easy route 
to the nearest automated teller machines or bank counter, the share of people finding it 
more difficult to obtain cash has recently risen significantly. Against this background, this 
article presents an analysis of the availability and reachability of cash withdrawal facilities in 
Germany. How are points of access to cash distributed across municipalities? On average, 
how far do people live from their nearest cash withdrawal facility? And is access to cash 
guaranteed in both urban and rural areas?
Around 6,000 municipalities with a total of 80.7 million inhabitants have at least one  or ATM
bank counter. However, 3.6 million people in Germany have to leave their own community in 
order to obtain cash from a credit institution. Evaluations of routes between places of 
residence and the nearest cash withdrawal facility show that people live on average 
1.4 kilometres from the banking industry’s nearest point of access to cash. 95.3% of the 
population has an  or bank counter within 5 kilometres of their home and only 0.3% of ATM
the total population has to travel more than 10 kilometres to obtain cash from one of 
Germany’s credit institutions.
In urban areas, the average distance to the nearest cash withdrawal location is shorter than 
in rural areas. While the nearest bank counter or  in urban regions is 1.1 kilometres ATM
away on average, those living rurally have to travel 1.9 kilometres on average. In total, 
90.3% of the rural population have access to an  or bank counter within 5 kilometres, in ATM
comparison with 98.1% of the urban population.
Retailers’ provision of cash withdrawal services complements the credit institution infrastruc-
ture. In addition to sourcing from  and bank branches, the public can obtain cash at ATMs
certain points of sale. The average distance to the nearest cash withdrawal facility drops 
from 1.4 kilometres to 1.2 kilometres if points of sale are taken into account along with  ATMs
and bank counters.

Access to cash in Germany
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 60Notwithstanding the observed reduction in  and bank branches and the deteriorating ATMs
perception of cash availability among the general public, these results paint a picture of an 
overall dense network of cash withdrawal facilities in Germany. Access to cash therefore 
appears to be guaranteed for the German population at present. In order for the freedom of 
choice between cash and digital means of payment to endure, infrastructure for the supply 
of cash must remain intact in future. As part of the Eurosystem’s cash strategy, the Bundes-
bank is committed to ensuring that cash remains available as a payment method and store 
of value.

Access to cash in Germany
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 611 Access to cash
A well-developed cash infrastructure is necessary for cash to be used as a means of 
payment and store of value.  The Bundesbank has a statutory mandate to supply cash 
in Germany. Its tasks include supplying credit institutions with banknotes and coins, 
which in turn supply consumers with cash at bank branches and ATMs .
Members of the public use this banking industry cash infrastructure to cover most 
of their cash needs.  are by far the most important withdrawal facilities in ATMs
Germany.  In a representative public survey carried out by the Bundesbank, 96% of 
respondents used  for cash withdrawals and 78% of the total amount of cash ATMs
withdrawn was taken out at  Bank counters have recently regained importance ATMs .
following a decline during the coronavirus pandemic. Their share of withdrawals rose 
from 11% in 2021 to 13% in 2023. In addition, points of sale have emerged as an 
additional important facility in recent years. There, consumers make 9% of their total 
withdrawals. 1)

3 While 41% of respondents used points of sale for cash withdrawals, 29% of respondents said they withdrew 
cash at the bank counter. Points of sale and bank counters are accessed by users with similar frequency, with 
an average of 14 and 15 withdrawals per year, respectively. At the same time, however, users withdraw signifi-
cantly higher amounts per transaction at bank counters (€451) than at points of sale (€102). See Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2024a).

Access to cash in Germany
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 62Credit institutions are closing more and more bank branches and ATMs . The number 
of bank branches more than halved between 2002 and 2023, going from around 53,000 
to approximately 21,000. By contrast, the number of  initially rose, reaching ATMs
around 59,000 in 2018. Since then, however, a steady decline has been observed here, 
too – there are around 51,000  at present. This dismantling of cash infrastructure ATMs
can be traced back to various developments. The long-standing trend towards closing 
bank branches is likely, amongst other factors, to be due to cost pressures in the 
banking sector and the increasing prevalence of online banking.  The phenomenon of 
robbers blowing up  is also likely to have accelerated the dismantling of cash infra- ATMs
structure in cases where damaged  are not put back into operation due to the risk ATMs
of repeated attacks and therefore the need for costly security measures.

5 In 2023, 461 abortive or successful attempts to blow up  were recorded. Despite a slight decline, this is ATMs
the second-highest number of cases since data collection began in 2005; see Federal Criminal Police Office 
(2023).

Access to cash in Germany
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 63At the same time, access to cash is increasingly perceived as difficult.  In 2023, the 
Bundesbank once again conducted a representative public survey on payment behav-
iour. According to the results of this payment behaviour study, the perceived difficulty 
of obtaining cash has increased lately. The proportion of respondents who found it 
fairly difficult or very difficult to get to an  or bank counter more than doubled ATM
from 6% in 2021 to 15% in 2023. This development affects people in urban and rural 
regions alike.
 6) 
6 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2024a). By European standards, only in Belgium (23%) and Spain (18%) do a larger 
share of the population report access to cash being fairly or very difficult. Overall, perceptions of access to 
cash in the euro area have deteriorated slightly of late; see European Central Bank (2024).

Access to cash in Germany
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 64These developments prompt the following analysis of the availability and reachabil-
ity of cash access points.  The first part of the analysis consists of an examination of the 
availability of bank branches,  and points of sale offering cash withdrawal in ATMs
municipalities. Then, location data for points of access to cash are combined with 
population information in 100×100 metre grid cells. Traffic routes and travel times to 
the nearest cash access points are calculated for each of the roughly 3.6 million inhab-
ited grid cells in Germany, creating an understanding of the reachability of cash 
withdrawal facilities by means of private motor transport. For the purposes of compari-
son, access to cash in both rural and urban regions will be considered.


Access to cash in Germany
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 652 Cash access points in municipalities
In Germany, 63.8% of the population live in urban regions, which make up only 
30.7% of all municipalities.  Around two-thirds of the population in Germany live in 
urban regions, which make up 3,374 municipalities. The 16 metropolises alone are 
home to around 15.1 million people, representing 17.9% of the total population. With 
around 21.4 million inhabitants, medium-sized cities and their peripheral urban areas 
are the most populous type of space within the urban regions. By contrast, 7,616 of the 
10,990 total municipalities are counted as rural regions, and are home to around 30.5 
million people. Around 4 out of 5 rural communities are classified as small-town or 
village areas, which illustrates the predominant spatial structure within the rural 
regions.

Access to cash in Germany
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 67Members of the public can withdraw cash at a total of 64,458 different withdrawal 
facilities nationwide.  33,169 of the locations are operated by credit institutions or 
independent  providers.  Of these, 19,133 are bank branches. At least one  is ATM ATM
available at all recorded banking industry locations.  In addition, there are 31,289 
locations where cash can be obtained at a point of sale. Around one-third of the 
locations offer both cashback and cash-in-shop services.  A total of 29,481 locations 
offer cashback, while 12,319 locations offer cash-in-shop. 7)

albeit usually for a fee.
8 At the end of 2023, the number of reported credit institutions and their branches amounted to 20,904 (of 
which 19,501 are branches); see Deutsche Bundesbank (2024b). As part of this analysis, credit institutions in 
Germany reported 19,133 bank offices as being cash withdrawal facilities. The discrepancy is likely to be 
explained, at least in part, by the fact that cash services are not offered at all bank locations. The number of
 exceeds the number of locations under review, as sites usually feature more than one machine – these are ATMs
combined in the analyses as one cash withdrawal facility.
9 In a cashback transaction, cash is withdrawn during a business transaction at the cash register. Cash-in-shop 
services allow customers to both withdraw and deposit cash. No purchase of goods is required to use cash-in-
shop services, as these are formally classed as outsourced banking transactions.

Notes on the data used
With a view to analysing the distribution and reachability of points of access to cash 
in urban and rural regions, municipalities are classified on the basis of a regional 
statistical spatial typology.  The analysis employs the regional statistical spatial typol-
ogy (RegioStaR) devised by the Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport  and ( ) BMDV
the Federal Institute for Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development
 Municipalities are assigned to the various spatial categories based on struc- ( ). BBSR
tural features and location criteria. At base, the typology distinguishes between urban 
and rural regions, while then making subdivisions within these two zone types.
Urban regions comprise large cities and their catchment areas.  Large cities are cities 
with at least 100,000 inhabitants; a distinction is drawn between metropolises and 
other large cities.  Metropolises are those cites which are particularly populous and 
which, together with their metropolitan region, play a prominent role in – for 
instance – the political, economic, scientific or cultural sphere. The catchment area of a 
large city is defined based on travel times and regional commuter structures. Within 
the catchment area around large cities, a distinction is made between medium-sized 
cities, including the surrounding urban area, and small-town and village areas. Medium-
sized cities are municipalities which have at least 25,000 inhabitants and perform 
certain central functions, such as provision of healthcare. Adjacent, densely populated 
municipalities are classified as urban areas, while sparsely populated municipalities in 
the catchment area are labelled as small towns and villages. 1)

implemented in collaboration with the Federal Institute for Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial 
Development; see Sigismund (2018).
2 The RegioStaR 7 spatial typology applied here differentiates not only between metropolises but also between 
regiopolises and large cities; see Sigismund (2018). For simplicity’s sake, this article uses the categories 
“metropolises” and “other large cities”.

Municipalities outside urban regions are classified as rural zones.  Here, central cities 
perform key employment and supply functions. Central cities are densely populated 
municipalities with at least 40,000 inhabitants as well as important regional functions. 
In line with the approach described above, the remaining rural municipalities are sub-
divided into medium-sized cities and their accompanying urban areas and those charac-
terised as small towns or villages.
This article’s geographical analyses of the regional availability of cash withdrawal 
facilities in Germany are based on a research dataset.  The Bundesbank does not have 
any official statistics on the locations of  bank branches or points of sale offering ATMs ,
access to cash. As such, the data needed for the 2023 reference year have been drawn 
together from a variety of sources. The bulk of the data on bank branch and  ATM
locations are supplied directly by credit institutions. Location data on points of sale 
offering cash withdrawal services are mostly taken from the Federal Agency for Cartog-

ses, when several withdrawal options are available at a single location they are counted 
together as one withdrawal facility. All in all, this yields a research dataset that should 
capture virtually all withdrawal facilities in Germany.Table 3.1: Regional statistical spatial typology

Access to cash in Germany
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 70Most people in Germany can obtain cash within the borders of their home municipal-
ity. Around 80.7 million people, or 95.7% of the total population, live in municipalities

withdrawal option, the point of sale therefore generally complements cash withdrawal 
services offered by the banking industry and is only in exceptional cases the sole 
withdrawal option within a municipality.  From the Bundesbank’s perspective, the 
supply of cash by retailers can complement the banking industry’s supply in a meaning-
ful way, but cannot replace it. This is because the Bundesbank pays out banknotes and 
coins to credit institutions, meaning only the banking industry can bring fresh 
banknotes and coins into circulation. Moreover, retailers’ offerings are not fully compa-
rable to the banking industry’s in terms of opening hours, available amounts and 
denominations, for example. 10) 
 11) 
 12) 
10 As the total population also includes children and young people, the actual number of potential withdrawers 
of cash is smaller.
11 By way of comparison, 1,319 municipalities with a combined population of around 2.7 million have a cash 
withdrawal facility operated by the banking industry but no way to withdraw cash at a point of sale.

Access to cash in Germany
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 72In urban and rural areas, the majority of the population lives in municipalities with a 
bank counter or ATM . Within the urban regions, 98.0% of the population live in munici-
palities with a bank-based withdrawal facility. In rural regions, this is 91.7% of the 
population. A point of sale offering cash withdrawals is available to 96.9% of the urban 
population and 85.9% of the rural population. The banking industry’s cash supply 
services in rural regions are thus much more widespread than the retail sector’s 
services. Around 0.9 million urban residents have no cash withdrawal options within 
their municipality. At 2.4 million, more than twice as many rural inhabitants live in a 
municipality without its own cash withdrawal facility.
It is small-town and village areas in particular which lack cash withdrawal facilities.  
Of the roughly 0.9 million urban residents without a point of access to cash within their 
own municipality, around 0.8 million live in small-town or village areas. Of the 4,781 
municipalities in Germany without a cash withdrawal facility, 3,503 are rural small 
towns or villages. 93.2% of the 3.3 million living in such areas – 2.2 million people – 
have no point of access to cash within their municipality.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 743 Reachability of cash access points
The analyses on the reachability of cash access points are based on a densely woven 
network of grid cells and route calculations . Germany’s inhabited areas can be 
divided into around 3.6 million grid cells each measuring 100×100 metres. Coordinates 
for the centre of the grid and information about the number of inhabitants are avail-
able for each cell. To analyse reachability of cash access points, the routes from each  
grid cell to the nearest cash withdrawal facility in terms of travel time are identified. To 
this end, routes to at least five nearby banking industry cash access points and points 
of sale are calculated for each cell, starting from its centre.  The route with the short-
est travel time is selected from among these options. The route profile only includes 
routes that can be taken using private motor transport, as a representative Bundes-
bank survey indicates that members of the general public prefer to travel by car, motor-
cycle or scooter to cash withdrawal facilities. 13)

Access to cash in Germany
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 75The average distance between home and the nearest cash withdrawal facility within 
a region takes into account the distribution of the population across the grid cells.  
In some cases, population numbers vary greatly between the grid cells. All distances 
and travel times between grid cell and withdrawal facility are therefore weighted by the 
given grid cell's share in the total population of its respective region. The population-
weighted average distances and travel times then provide a representative overview of 
the average distance between home and the nearest cash withdrawal facility and thus 
the regional reachability of cash access points.
 16) 
16 The analyses are based on the individual effort involved in the route from home to the nearest point of 
access to cash. It is not possible to take into account the fact that cash withdrawals are usually combined with 
day-to-day activities such as going shopping or to work. Only in 15% of cases do people leave the house solely 
to withdraw cash from a bank counter or an  as shown by the results of a representative public survey; see ATM ,
Deutsche Bundesbank (2022a, 2022b). The analysis thus potentially overestimates the individual effort 
involved in accessing cash, but nevertheless provides information on how cash access points are distributed in 
relation to the local population in Germany.

Access to cash in Germany
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 76In Germany, people live 1.4 kilometres on average from the nearest ATM  or bank 
counter . The car journey there takes around three minutes on average. This means 
that around six minutes of pure travel time are required for the round trip to a cash 
access point operated by the banking industry. This is in line with the results of a repre-
sentative survey, in which respondents estimated that it took them an average of nine 
minutes to withdraw cash at  or bank counters.  People have to travel ATMs
1.7 kilometres on average to the nearest point of sale offering cashback or cash-in-
shop services. 17)

Access to cash in Germany
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 80Access to ATMs  in Germany is similar to that in other countries.  The methodology 
used in the analysis to take account of traffic routes and the spatial distribution of the 
population is increasingly becoming the international standard.  For Austria, the 
average distance from home to the nearest  is 1.2 kilometres, with 66.6% of the ATM

from an ATM .
In Germany, most people dwelling in urbanised regions live around a kilometre 
away from the banking industry’s nearest cash withdrawal facility.  For example, the 
distance to the nearest bank counter or  in large cities that do not count as a ATM
metropolis is 0.9 kilometres on average. Around two-thirds of the population of these 
areas live no further than 1 kilometre from a cash withdrawal facility. Residents of 
central cities in rural regions live only slightly further away from a banking industry-op-
erated cash access point, at 1.1 kilometres on average. Here, around 3 out of 5 people 
have to drive no more than 1 kilometre to reach the nearest bank counter or  ATM .
Turning to medium-sized cities, the average distances to a banking industry-operated 
cash withdrawal facility are 1.2 kilometres in urban regions and 1.5 kilometres in rural 
regions. 19)

21 See Trütsch and Nägelin (2024).
22 See Chen et al. (2023). The authors calculate routes between cash access points and dissemination blocks 
instead of grid cells. A dissemination block is a geographical area that is bounded on all sides by roads. It is 
the smallest geographic area for which population and household distributions can be derived from the micro-
census and therefore provides a suitable basis for comparison with the results presented here. Further analy-
ses on access to cash are available for Australia (Guttmann et al., (2023)), France (Devigne et al., (2022)), Spain

straight-line distances, meaning that the results cannot be compared with those presented here.

Access to cash in Germany
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 81Residents of small-town and village areas have to go the furthest to access cash.  
These inhabitants, of whom there are roughly 18.5 million, have to travel more than 
2 kilometres on average to the nearest point of access to cash belonging to a bank or 
savings bank. Of the 5.3 million people living on the urban periphery, 39.3% live no 
further than 1 kilometre from a bank branch or an  Around 68.2% of them live no ATM .
more than 3 kilometres away. By contrast, 63.9% of people living in small towns and 
villages in rural regions have a bank-based point of access to cash within a radius of 
3 kilometres.  In these sparsely populated areas, the average distance to the nearest 
point of sale offering cash withdrawal is longer than to the cash infrastructure provided 
by the banking industry. This indicates that, overall, access to important infrastructure 
is more difficult in these areas. This is true not only of access to cash, but for other day-
to-day activities too.
When accessing cash, the point of sale supplements the banking industry’s range of 
services, but is not a substitute . Across Germany, 57.7% of the population live within a 
kilometre of a bank counter or  In some regions, the point of sale shortens the ATM .
route to the nearest point of access to cash, meaning that cashback and cash-in-shop 
services help facilitate access to cash. For example, the share of the population with 
access to a cash withdrawal facility within a radius of 1 kilometre increases by 
9.9 percentage points to 67.6% if, in addition to the cash withdrawal points provided by 
the banking industry, the withdrawal options offered by the retail sector are also taken 
into account. However, the point of sale is not a substitute for bank counters or  ATMs .
For example, much of the cash withdrawn at the point of sale does not have to be 
checked beforehand, meaning that cash that is no longer fit for circulation may 
continue to circulate unchecked. By contrast, credit institutions can and must make a 
proper check of the quality and authenticity of cash. Credit institutions’ close involve-
ment in the cash cycle thus remains essential, especially because the services offered 
by retailers primarily facilitate access to cash in urban regions and where distances 
tend to be shorter anyway.  For the remaining areas, such supplementary withdrawal 
options only marginally improve ease of access to cash. 23) 
 24) 
23 In their analyses, Stix (2020), Trütsch and Nägelin (2024) and Chen et al. (2023) also find that the rural popula-
tion has to travel longer distances.

Access to cash in Germany
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 82Although the majority of people in Germany have a cash access point nearby, many 
feel that it is becoming increasingly difficult to access cash.  According to the results 
presented, a dense network of cash withdrawal facilities appears to be available in 
Germany on the whole. Despite this, the share of people who find it fairly difficult or 
very difficult to get to an  or bank counter has gone up significantly of late, rising ATM
from 6% in 2021 to 15% in 2023.  It is possible that the subjective assessment of the 
outlay involved in obtaining cash is influenced by factors that are not reflected in the 
geographical analysis. Anecdotal evidence suggests that  are increasingly being ATMs
locked outside of business hours to protect against explosive attacks, making them less 
available. In addition, the closure of bank branches and the scaling back of  may ATMs
have meant longer distances to travel in some cases. The public’s perception that 
access to cash is becoming more difficult is one reason to continue analysing the avail-
ability of cash in Germany in the future using various approaches.
 25) 
25 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2024a).

Access to cash in Germany
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 83The geographical availability of cash withdrawal facilities has also deteriorated 
somewhat of late.  The Bundesbank has already analysed the geographical availability 
of cash withdrawal facilities in Germany in an earlier study, but the results are not 
directly comparable to the results presented here because the methodology has 
improved since then. The supplementary information below explores developments in 
the cash infrastructure between 2021 and 2023. It reveals that the high degree of avail-
ability and reachability of cash withdrawal facilities within municipalities has deterio-
rated moderately between these two reference years.

Comparison with earlier analyses
Comparing findings against previous results gives an idea of how cash infrastruc-
ture is evolving.  The Bundesbank last analysed the spatial availability of cash access 
points in Germany for the reference year 2021.  The examination below explores 
changes in the provision of cash access points in municipalities and in how easy or hard 
it is to get to withdrawal facilities. Note that changes in municipality structure, such as 
the dissolution or amalgamation of municipalities, can impair the comparability of the 
results.  In addition, the dataset for the reference year 2023 contains approximately 
3,500 more retail sites than the dataset for the reference year 2021. As data on retailer 
locations are typically gathered from secondary sources, this increase is likely to be 
partly due to more comprehensive coverage. By contrast, location data for bank 
branches and  are predominantly provided directly by the banking industry and ATMs
hence are considered complete for both the reference year 2021 and the reference 
year 2023.
The situation in terms of the presence of bank counter and ATM  facilities in munici-
palities has deteriorated slightly.  While 96.0% of Germany’s population still had a 
branch or  in their own municipality in 2021, that figure now stands at 95.7%. The ATM
number of municipalities where it was possible to withdraw cash at a bank or savings 
bank without crossing into another municipality fell by 154. By contrast, the number of 
municipalities recorded as having a point of sale cash withdrawal option has risen 
significantly. 1)

The previous analyses on the reachability of withdrawal facilities are based on “as 
the crow flies” measurements between the centre of the municipality and the 
closest cash access point.  The shifts in methodology to utilising grid data for the 
spatial distribution of the population and the use of distance calculations for traffic

Access to cash in Germany
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 86There has been a moderate increase in the effort involved in obtaining cash in 
Germany.  Compared with 2021, the average distance between the centre of the munici-
pality and the nearest cash access point has grown by 100 metres to 1.7 kilometres. 
The average distance to the nearest bank counter increased by 200 metres and to the 
nearest  by 100 metres. By contrast, the calculated average distance to the nearest ATM
point of sale offering cash withdrawal decreased. In addition, cash access points are 
now less often available within a kilometre of the centre of the municipality. The propor-
tion of the population living less than 1 kilometre from the nearest bank counter or ATM
fell by 0.6 and 0.3 percentage point respectively. That said, at 0.7% of the total popula-
tion, it is still the case that only a small proportion of people live in municipalities where 
the nearest point of access to cash is more than 5 kilometres away from the centre of 
the municipality.

Access to cash in Germany
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 88The new methodology using a population grid and route calculations yields more 
realistic results with regard to the reachability of cash withdrawal facilities.  The “as 
the crow flies” approach, along with the implicit assumption that all inhabitants live in a 
concentrated mass at the centre of a given municipality, results in the reachability of 
cash access points being overestimated. For example, applying the old methodology 
suggests that around 80.3 million people (95.2% of the total population) live no further 
than 1 kilometre from the nearest cash withdrawal facility. Conversely, the analyses 
produced by the new methodology and presented in this article reveal that approxi-
mately 57.0 million inhabitants (67.6% of the total population) have a cash withdrawal 
facility no further than 1 kilometre from their place of residence. According to the new 
method, 96.0% of the total population lives no further than 5 kilometres from the 
nearest cash withdrawal location, as opposed to 99.3%.

Access to cash in Germany
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 894 Conclusion
Cash is appreciated in Germany as a means of payment and store of value.  Although 
consumers in Germany are paying with cashless methods more and more often, cash 
remains the most widely used means of payment. People in Germany settle around 
51% of everyday transactions using cash.  In times of crisis, amongst other situa-
tions, cash is in demand as a store of value – as suggested by the significant increase in 
euro banknote circulation during the coronavirus pandemic, for example.  Cash 
reserves also allow people to get by when cashless payment systems are down owing 
to technical disruptions or other crisis situations.
To ensure that people in Germany remain free to choose between cash and other 
means of payment and that cash can be used in times of crisis, reliable access to 
cash is needed.  As part of the Eurosystem’s cash strategy, the Bundesbank is commit-
ted to ensuring the ongoing freedom of choice between cash and digital payment 
methods.  When it comes to accessing cash, consumers rely especially heavily on the 
cash infrastructure operated by credit institutions, which provides them with more than 
90% of the cash they withdraw in total. 26)

Access to cash in Germany
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 90At present, the general public in Germany can source cash from a dense network of 
cash access points.  There are  or bank counters in 6,043 out of 10,990 municipali- ATMs
ties. Around 96% of the total population lives in these communities. However, around 
3.6 million people in Germany have to travel outside of their home municipality in order 
to obtain cash from a credit institution. On average, members of the general public live 
1.4 kilometres from the nearest point of access to cash operated by the banking indus-
try. 95.3% of the total population have a bank counter or an  within 5 kilometres of ATM
their home. Bank counters and  in municipalities are less common and more diffi- ATMs
cult to access in rural regions than in urban regions. For example, residents of small 
towns and villages in rural regions have to travel around 2.7 kilometres on average to a 
banking industry-operated cash withdrawal facility, compared with an average of 
0.8 kilometres in metropolises. The option to withdraw cash at the point of sale is also 
widespread in Germany and complements the banking industry’s range of services. 
Throughout Germany, the average distance to the nearest point of sale offering cash 
withdrawal is 1.7 kilometres.
There are signs that the availability of cash is trending downwards.  The Bundesbank 
commissioned a study entitled “Cash of the future” to take a systematic look at the 
future of cash. The study explored three possible future scenarios. In all of these scenar-
ios, access to cash deteriorates and its acceptance and use decrease.  The decline in 
the number of bank branches and  as well as the growing proportion of people ATMs
who find that more effort is required to access cash support the conjecture that good 
access to cash in Germany might no longer be a matter of course in the future. 29)

Monetary policy communication according to artificial intelligence
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 94Central banks use press conferences and other public statements to communicate their 
monetary policy decisions and their assessments of economic developments. This influences 
market participants’ expectations regarding the future monetary policy stance. Communica-
tion, like conventional monetary policy instruments, can thus have an impact on aggregate 
demand and inflation dynamics. A significant factor in the signal effect of communication is 
whether the statements are indicative of restrictive or accommodative monetary policy, 
commonly referred to as “hawkish” and “dovish”, respectively. An optimistic or pessimistic 
tone can also change the effect. 
At present, state-of-the-art technologies such as artificial intelligence  are increasingly ()AI
being used to analyse monetary policy communication in an efficient way. The Bundesbank 
has developed a novel  model named the Monetary-Intelligent Language Agent  that AI ( ) MILA
can produce detailed, consistent and transparent evaluations of monetary policy texts.  MILA
classifies individual sentences, taking into account the macroeconomic context, and justifies 
its own assessment. On the basis of this sentence-by-sentence classification, the model calcu-
lates a comprehensible evaluation of the overall text.  
According to  the communication by the  Governing Council between 2011 and MILA , ECB
2024 was broadly in line with the macroeconomic environment in the euro area. Monetary 
policy communication was predominantly dovish, especially at the peak of the coronavirus 
pandemic in 2020. In 2021, the Governing Council increasingly balanced its inflation narra-
tive, but communication on key interest rates initially remained dovish. For the period of 
monetary policy tightening between 2022 and 2023,  sees a marked shift towards MILA
hawkish press conferences and speeches. In 2024, communication became more balanced.  
AI analysis does not replace human expertise, but improves the understanding of monetary 
policy communication and its impact. However, the increasing prevalence of  analyses AI
could also reduce the incentives for different market participants to obtain and evaluate 
their own information. This could lead to lesser diversity of opinion and make central bank 
communication more challenging. Critical examination of assisted text analysis and the AI-
associated risks therefore remains essential.

Monetary policy communication according to artificial intelligence
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 951 The role of communication in monetary policy
In recent decades, central bank communication has taken on an increasingly impor-
tant role in monetary policy.  It is now a key instrument in the established toolkit that 
central banks use to steer their monetary policy stance (see the supplementary informa-
tion entitled “ ”). In fact, some economists even Measuring the monetary policy stance
argue that communication is the single most important monetary policy instrument.  
Monetary policy communication through press conferences, speeches and other public 
statements conveys messages about monetary policy decisions and the state of the 
economy.  These messages, in turn, influence market participants’ expectations and 
thus also market interest rates, which are of critical importance for financing conditions 
and the transmission of monetary policy. In this way, through additional signal effects, 
communication complements and supports the direct impact of changes to key interest 
rates or asset purchase programmes.
Monetary policy communication sends direct and indirect signals about the 
monetary policy stance, particularly regarding the future path of key interest rates. 
Direct information is represented by statements by the central bank concerning 
monetary policy instruments, primarily including statements on its current decisions 
and signals regarding the future path of key interest rates.  Indirect information is 
transmitted by the central bank via the economic narrative, which consists, in particu-
lar, of its assessment of the current and future path of inflation and the real economy. 1) 
 2) 
 3) 
1 US economist Michael Woodford writes: “Because the key decision-makers in an economy are forward-look-
ing, central banks affect the economy as much through their influence on expectations as through any direct, 
mechanical effects of central bank trading in the market for overnight cash.” In the view of Ben Bernanke, 
former Chairman of the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve, communication is actually more important US
than key interest rate decisions themselves: “Monetary policy is 98% talk and 2% action”. See Woodford (2005) 
and Bernanke (2022).
2 In addition, interviews, publication of data, economic forecasts, regular reports, or minutes of meetings could 
also be interpreted as communication by central banks. See, for example, Deutsche Bundesbank (2000), 
Blinder et al. (2008), Apel and Blix Grimaldi (2014), and Istrefi et al. (2024).
3 An especially strong form of direct information is “forward guidance”, whereby the central bank makes explicit 
statements on future key interest rates or its monetary policy reaction function. The  issued forward guidance ECB
for the first time in July 2013. At that time, it communicated that it “expect[ed] the key  interest rates to remain ECB
at present or lower levels for an extended period of time”. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2013), Hartmann and 
Smets (2018), Rostagno et al. (2019), Weidmann (2019), and Taskforce on Rate Forward Guidance and Reinvest-
ment (2022). 

Monetary policy communication according to artificial intelligence
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 96Direct and indirect information can be “hawkish” or “dovish”, indicating rising or 
high key interest rates and falling or low key interest rates, respectively.  “Hawkish” 
describes a position advocating restrictive monetary policy to safeguard price stability. 
Such communication emphasises the need to raise key interest rates, or maintain them 
at an elevated level, in order to combat high rates of inflation. A “dovish” stance, by 
contrast, is in favour of accommodative monetary policy. Dovish statements argue for 
lowering key interest rates, or maintaining them at a low level, in order to stimulate 
aggregate demand and thereby bring up excessively low rates of inflation. If market 
participants perceive communication to be unexpectedly hawkish or dovish, they will 
adjust their expectations about the future monetary policy stance. Surprising communi-
cation can thus have an impact on growth and inflation. 4) 
4 This means that communication can have a similar effect to a monetary policy shock, i.e. a change in key inter-
est rates that was not expected by market participants. See Bernanke and Blinder (1992) and Christiano et al. 
(1999). 

Monetary policy communication according to artificial intelligence
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 97Furthermore, a role in the monetary policy signal effect is also played by whether 
communication exhibits positive or negative sentiment.  Positive statements by the 
central bank about the economic situation or inflation dynamics can boost optimism in 
markets and among the general public.  By contrast, negative statements – e.g. about 
undesirable economic developments, uncertainties or risks – can lead to pessimism.  
For this reason, the sentiment of the economic narrative also shapes market partici-
pants’ expectations about future monetary policy measures and economic develop-
ments.  This can likewise affect actual consumption and investment decisions. Senti-
ment depends largely on the inflation context: a hypothetical statement of “price 
pressures are rising” would be considered positive if inflation were below target, but 
negative if inflation were above target. In both instances, however, this statement 
would be classified as hawkish. The aspects of positivity and negativity are therefore 
not equivalent to the aspects of hawkishness and dovishness. Moreover, normative 
statements using the two scales should only be derived with consideration of the 
overall macroeconomic context. The assessment of whether specific communication is 
consistent with the targeted objectives from the perspective of monetary policy 
decision-makers must always take account of the economic situation and the corre-
spondingly appropriate monetary policy stance.   5)

5 See Picault and Renault (2017). 
6 Not only the economic narratives of central banks but also their monetary policy decisions themselves can 
send signals about the economic situation. The literature describes this using the term “central bank informa-
tion effect” (or “information shock”). See Cieslak and Schrimpf (2019), Deutsche Bundesbank (2020, 2021b), 
Jarociński and Karadi (2020), and Kerssenfischer (2022). 
7 In addition to verbal communication, sentiment can also be conveyed through non-verbal communication, 
such as the speaker’s facial expression or tone of voice. See Curti and Kazinnik (2023), Gorodnichenko et al. 
(2023), and Kanelis and Siklos (2023). 
8 In addition to the aspects mentioned here, the comprehensibility or complexity of the language used is also 
relevant in the central bank context. See Hayo et al. (2022). 

Monetary policy communication according to artificial intelligence
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 98In the Eurosystem, press conferences following the meetings of the ECB Governing 
Council play a key role in communication with the public.  Following monetary policy 
meetings of the  Governing Council, the monetary policy decisions taken are ECB
published in a “Monetary policy decisions” press release. This is followed by a press 
conference opening with a speech by the  President, which, since the rollout of the ECB
new monetary policy strategy in July 2021, has been known as the “Monetary policy 
statement”.  In addition to an explanation of the monetary policy decisions, this also 
includes the Governing Council’s assessment of current economic developments. The 
analysis presented in this article focuses on texts from this first part of the press confer-
ences during the period from November 2011 (the beginning of Mario Draghi’s term as
 President) to December 2024. It abstracts from the second part of the press confer-ECB
ence, in which the  President answers questions from members of the press.  ECB
Furthermore, monetary policy speeches by the  Executive Board during the period ECB
from November 2011 to August 2024 are also analysed. Public statements by central 
bank representatives can explain past decisions or provide individual viewpoints on 
economic developments. Speeches thus transmit relevant monetary policy signals in 
the periods between the official meetings of the  Governing Council. The analysis ECB
comprises a total of 119 monetary policy statements and 377 speeches.   9)

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 99Supplementary information
Measuring the monetary policy stance
The monetary policy stance is multidimensional due to the use of multiple monetary 
policy instruments.  The various monetary policy instruments have differing effects on 
the maturity segments of the yield curve, on asset prices and on exchange rates.  
While the level of key interest rates is crucial, especially for very short-term market 
rates, communication plays a key role for medium-term market rates. Central banks’ 
asset purchases affect longer-term maturities, in particular. This is relevant because the 
entire yield curve is crucial for monetary policy transmission, i.e. the impact of 
monetary policy on households’ and firms’ consumption and investment decisions.  In 
addition, the use of monetary policy instruments affects risk premia in a broad 
spectrum of different financial market segments, especially through investors’ varying 
risk appetite.  It may therefore be insufficient to assess the monetary policy stance 
solely on the basis of the level of key interest rates. For example, the  key interest ECB
rate stood at 4% in both March 2024 and August 2007, while the ten-year  rate OIS
stood at 2.5% and 4.6%, respectively. Measured by the level of this long-term interest 
rate, the monetary policy stance may therefore have been less restrictive in March 2024 
than in August 2007.  1)

Monetary policy communication according to artificial intelligence
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 100A comprehensive measure of the monetary policy stance is the Bundesbank’s proxy 
monetary policy rate ( ), PMPR  which combines information from the risk-free yield 
curve and risky asset prices.  This indicator is based on 11 financial market variables: 
risk-free interest rates over various maturities, yields on government and corporate 
bonds, spreads and the effective exchange rate of the euro. These financial market 
prices are available on a daily basis, which means that the indicator of the monetary 
policy stance can also be calculated at the same frequency. To this end, a statistical 
approach in the form of a principal component analysis is used to identify the typical co-
movement among the financial variables. First, two common factors are extracted.  
These are then used in a regression as explanatory variables for the short-term interest 
rate (the  interest rate with a maturity of seven days) for the period from 2005 to OIS
2012 (before the key interest rates reached the effective lower bound). The estimated 
values from this regression over the entire observation period yield the PMPR . 
The PMPR  suggests that the monetary policy stance between 2012 and 2021 was 
considerably more accommodative than signalled by key interest rates in isolation
(see Chart 4.1) Before 2012, the dynamics of the  and the short-term interest rate .  PMPR
were, by construction, largely similar – the regression serves to ensure that the indica-
tor largely corresponds to the short-term interest rate during this period, as monetary 
policy was steered almost exclusively by the policy rate at that time. After 2012, 
however, the indicator reflects the impact of other monetary policy instruments that 
were introduced after the effective lower bound had been reached. The  suggests PMPR
that forward guidance and central bank asset purchase programmes made the 
monetary policy stance considerably more accommodative at the lower bound.  
According to the indicator, this effect was equivalent to a further reduction in key inter-
est rates of around 150 basis points.  4) 
 5) 
4 A similar methodological approach is used by Doh and Choi (2016), Choi et al. (2022) and Jude and Levieuge 
(2024).
5 This is consistent with other indicators of the monetary policy stance at the lower bound, such as shadow 
rates. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2017) and Geiger and Schupp (2018). 

Monetary policy communication according to artificial intelligence
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 101According to the PMPR , between 2022 and 2023, the extent of monetary policy tight-
ening was comparable to the actual rise in key interest rates.  Based on the  PMPR ,
however, the monetary policy tightening began as early as the start of 2022, i.e. six 
months before the first interest rate hike. This reflects the fact that the anticipation 
effects of future key interest rate changes are captured at an early stage by the  PMPR
via their impact on medium-term and long-term interest rates.  The indicator shows 
that the maximum tightening impulse was in September 2023, when key interest rates 
were last raised. The stance has recently been more accommodative, in some cases 
considerably so, than the short-term interest rates suggest. This is a reflection of lower 
medium-term and long-term interest rates as well as narrower spreads on government 
and corporate bonds by historical standards.
 6) 
 7) 
6 The gradual reduction in the balance sheet, which began in 2022, is also evident in the  albeit to a lesser PMPR ,
extent. The primary determinant of yield effects is the level of securities holdings.

the tightening cycle began in 2022, see also Deutsche Bundesbank (2025).

Monetary policy communication according to artificial intelligence
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 1022 History of monetary policy communication analysis
In light of the increasingly transparent communication strategies of central banks 
since the 1990s, market participants have been focusing greater attention on 
analysing monetary policy statements.  Traditionally, central bank circles believed that 
monetary policy decision-makers should communicate with the public as little as possi-
ble and only cryptically. Over the past three decades, however, the predominant view 
has changed: now, the prevailing standpoint is that transparent communication can 
directly affect market participants’ expectations and thereby improve the efficiency of 
monetary policy.  With this paradigm shift in the style of central bank communica-
tion, market participants began to intensively examine monetary policy statements 
using their human expertise. In particular, the ability to correctly interpret and identify 
nuances in communication became a valuable asset. This is because, from the perspec-
tive of financial markets, even minor signals from central bank representatives can 
contain meaningful information and thus lead to strong market reactions.  For 
example, the euro depreciated significantly in October 2000 when  President Wim ECB
Duisenberg indicated that the  would no longer support the currency. The state-ECB
ment by  President Mario Draghi in July 2012 that “the  [was] ready to do ECB ECB
whatever it [took] to preserve the euro” also had a profound impact on markets.  12) 
 13) 
12 Transparent communication steers market participants’ expectations, promotes a clear understanding of the 
monetary policy stance, and strengthens public confidence in the central bank. This helps to anchor long-term 
inflation expectations and thereby safeguard price stability. See Clarida et al. (1999), Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2000, 2004), Blinder et al. (2008), Weidmann (2018, 2021), and Blinder et al. (2024). 
13 Even minimal changes in communication compared with previous statements can be significant and trigger 
considerable market movements. See Ehrmann and Talmi (2020). 

Monetary policy communication according to artificial intelligence
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 103Economic research has traditionally made use of human expertise to assess and 
quantify the characteristics of central bank communication.  Economists assess 
monetary policy texts manually, analysing the monetary policy stance and sentiment, in 
particular. Here, based on the human assessment, texts or individual text excerpts are 
assigned a numerical value: -1 for dovish statements, 0 for neutral statements, and +1 
for hawkish statements; and -1 for negative sentiment, 0 for neutral sentiment, and +1 
for positive sentiment.  This human classification offers numerous benefits. The 
specialist expertise utilised here enables contextual factors that are vital for interpret-
ing monetary policy communication to be comprehensively incorporated and quantita-
tively condensed. In addition, it allows for a flexible response to differing or nuanced 
formulations as well as highly detailed evaluations of the texts. However, the advan-
tages of human classification are offset by some key disadvantages. These assessments 
are, by their very nature, subjective and may be inconsistent over time, which can lead 
to misclassifications. Furthermore, this type of analysis takes a considerable amount of 
time.
To address the limitations of human classification, computer-assisted algorithms 
based on word frequencies have been developed.  This methodology creates a lexicon 
of terms or word combinations that typically appear in monetary policy texts.  Each 
entry in this lexicon is assigned a specific classification: for example, the combination of 
“inflation” and “rising” is classified as hawkish, while “growth” in conjunction with 
“falling” is classified as dovish. Using these categorisations, it is possible to determine 
the frequency of dovish or hawkish (or, alternatively, negative and positive) word combi-
nations within a given text. On this basis, a score on a scale from -1 to +1 can be calcu-
lated for the entire text. Sentiment is usually determined by calculating the difference 
between the numbers of positive and negative sentences and then dividing this by the 
total number of non-neutral sentences: 
 14)

14 This approach is also referred to as “content analysis”. See Jansen and De Haan (2005) and Ehrmann and 
Fratzscher (2007). 
15 See Apel and Blix Grimaldi (2014), Hansen and McMahon (2016), Picault and Renault (2017), Lombardi et 
al. (2019), and Aruoba and Drechsel (2024). 

Monetary policy communication according to artificial intelligence
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 104An overall value for the monetary policy stance can be calculated in a similar way using 
the numbers of hawkish and dovish sentences instead. The methodology using word 
frequencies has the major advantage of formal transparency and allows for consistent, 
detailed and comparatively fast evaluation. However, it is fairly mechanical in its applica-
tion and cannot take the context of the text into consideration. As a result, this method 
responds sensitively to linguistic nuances and minor variations in terminology, and is 
therefore susceptible to misclassification.
In more recent times, analysis using artificial intelligence – especially large 
language models – has proven promising.  Large language models  are trained ( ) LLMs

tion (“text mining”) as well as the identification and evaluation of statistical language 
patterns (“machine learning”). At first, specialised language models were used in 
economic research to evaluate monetary policy communication.  These models were 
trained using large volumes of text data and optimised using manually classified 
sentences from financial market or central bank contexts. Unlike the word frequency 
approach, this first generation of language models is, to a limited extent, able to take 
the immediate context of a text into consideration. However, their analysis is less trans-
parent and still neglects information beyond the actual text excerpt itself. By contrast, 
the latest  (such as  Llama and Gemini) are able to factor in additional informa- LLMs GPT,

ous approaches, in particular the flexibility of human analysis with the automation of

How large language models work
Large language models ( ) LLMs  are a form of artificial intelligence ()AI specifically 
designed to understand and generate natural language.  These models are based on 
neural network models consisting of multiple interlinked layers of neurons and are 
capable of recognising complex patterns in data. Each layer processes the input data 
and transmits the results to the next layer, through which the model learns increasingly 
abstract attributes of the data. Using activation functions between the layers enables 
non-linearities to be modelled. 
The Transformer architecture is one innovative type of these neural networks.  Trans-
formers were popularised by models such as Google AI’s  (Bidirectional Encoder BERT
Representations from Transformers) and Open AI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformer
 models and are based on the attention mechanism. They can capture words ( )GPT  
within a section of text, irrespective of their position, by using selective weights to 
understand the context. This enables them to recognise relationships between words 
that are far apart, which is a decisive factor in the processing of natural language. This 
represents a significant advantage over models from the previous generation, which 
were specifically designed for sequential data processing (recurrent neural networks
  ( )). RNN

Monetary policy communication according to artificial intelligence
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 106LLMs  are trained using enormous amounts of text data from various sources such 
as books, articles and websites, and their response accuracy is optimised by exten-
sive evaluation measures.  By being trained on these extensive datasets, the model

create contextual content on a variety of topics that is often barely distinguishable from 
human-generated text.  use techniques such as self-supervised learning, where LLMs
the next token (word or character) is predicted based on the context of the previous 
tokens. This results in a deep understanding of syntax, grammar, and stylistic nuances, 
allowing  to be used in a wide range of applications. In addition, the performance LLMs
of the models is evaluated and improved through reinforcement learning from human 
feedback  In this approach, humans provide feedback on the generated texts, ( ). RLHF
which is then used to further optimise the model and improve its ability to create high-
quality and relevant content.
Although LLMs  are often referred to as AI, they do not possess any real awareness 
or intelligence. They generate responses based on the statistical patterns learnt from 
their training data and can therefore occasionally produce errors or inaccurate 
responses (hallucination). Nevertheless, the development and application of  LLMs
represent significant technological progress with the potential to transform and 
improve many aspects of our everyday lives.

Monetary policy communication according to artificial intelligence
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 1073 Monetary-Intelligent Language Agent ( ) MILA
The Bundesbank has developed a new model called the Monetary-Intelligent 
Language Agent ( ) MILA  for the purposes of analysing central bank communication.
 MILA  is an  model that analyses monetary policy texts in an automated and rules-AI
based manner. The model approaches the task in a granular, transparent and consis-
tent way: it assesses individual sentences taking into account contextual information, 
justifies its classification and provides an assessment for the overall text using mathe-
matical formulae. Decomposing the text into individual sentences makes for greater 
transparency in the analysis, as this unit of text can be understood and assessed on a 
standalone basis by humans. This means that the human assessment of a sentence can 
be compared directly with the classification and associated justification produced by  AI
and checked for plausibility. Human readers can therefore easily interpret and evaluate 
the results. 18)

Monetary policy communication according to artificial intelligence
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 108MILA  is based on state-of-the-art language models, chained instructions and 
manual sample responses.  At its heart is a very powerful language model called 
Llama 3.1 70B.  The methodology for analysing central bank communication is based 
on established concepts applied when interacting with based language models AI-
(prompt engineering). The language model is assigned the identity of an economist 
specialised in monetary policy analysis at a central bank (role-based prompting). 
Prompt chaining is employed, with the model being given a set of multi-step instruc-
tions to follow as it analyses a monetary policy text.  In addition to the specific task, 
each work step includes sample texts demonstrating a correct assessment in the eyes 
of an expert (few-shot prompting).  The examples also specify that a brief explana-

Monetary policy communication according to artificial intelligence
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 110MILA ’s first step when presented with an ECB press conference is to derive the infla-
tion context; this inflation context serves as background information for the actual 
classification.  Information on current inflation dynamics is a crucial component when 
analysing many statements concerning monetary policy. For example, the hypothetical 
remark “inflation rose last month” can only be accurately classified as positive or 
negative if one knows where inflation stands at the time.  If inflation were above the 
2% target, the statement would be negative; if inflation were below target, the state-
ment would be positive. Furthermore, the fact that the  Governing Council aims for ECB
an inflation rate of 2% over the medium term means that medium-term inflation expec-
tations are a relevant part of examining many other statements.  extracts the infla- MILA
tion context from the  made when new /Eurosystem staff macroeconomic MPSs ECB
projections are released (March, June, September and December).  
MILA  then proceeds by analysing the communication in ECB press conferences on 
monetary policy instruments and assessing whether it is hawkish or dovish.  The 
opening paragraph of the  typically lays out the decisions taken by the  Govern- MPS ECB
ing Council along with explanations and comments on the planned trajectory going 
forward.  analyses this section of the text along four dimensions: interest rate MILA
decision, interest rate outlook, inflation, and general tone. A pre-defined scoring 
system is used to formulate a “Decision Hawk-O-Meter” from the assessment of these 
dimensions.  This indicator reflects the degree of hawkishness or dovishness of direct 
monetary policy communication in the eyes of the digital economist. The scale ranges 
from -1 (very dovish) to +1 (very hawkish). 24) 
 25) 
 26) 
24 The first generation of language models is not capable of factoring in context beyond the text that it is 
processing. As a result, producing a state-dependent evaluation of inflation-related communication is challeng-
ing for these models.
25 In principle, it would also be possible at this point in the process to have experts provide additional direct 
information (e.g. on the output gap) or to extract additional information.
26 For a more detailed description of the scoring system, see Geiger et al. (2025).

Monetary policy communication according to artificial intelligence
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 111In a third step, MILA  examines the hawkishness or dovishness of the economic 
narrative by classifying individual sentences from the press conference.  Once the 
monetary policy decisions have been presented,  press conferences feature a ECB
detailed economic narrative.  This section covers the Governing Council’s assessment 
of real economic developments, inflation dynamics, and the financial and monetary 
landscape. Each sentence is classified into one of five categories: dovish, moderately 
dovish, neutral, moderately hawkish, hawkish (see the supplementary information 
entitled “ ”). When performing its assessment,  Examples of classifications by MILA MILA
draws on additional context by taking account of the inflation context for the date in 
question that was ascertained in the first step plus the monetary policy decisions as 
well as previous sentences. On the basis of the sentence-level classification, a Hawk-O-
Meter for the entire economic narrative in the text at hand is calculated outside of the
 by applying the following formula:   LLM
The resulting indicator can be interpreted in economic terms: a text’s Hawk-O-Meter 
takes a value of -1 if  assesses all statements as being dovish and a value of +1 if it MILA
assesses all statements as being hawkish. In addition to looking at the narrative as a 
whole, it is also possible to make a differentiated analysis, focusing on specific thematic 
aspects.  For example,  is also capable of calculating the Hawk-O-Meter just for MILA
statements directly related to inflation or the real economy.  27)

…” or “I will now outline in more detail …”.
28 See Apel and Blix Grimaldi (2014), Picault and Renault (2017), Kanelis and Siklos (2025), and Geiger et al. 
(2025). 
29 To accomplish this,  assigns the individual sentences to various topics (topic modelling). See Deutsche MILA
Bundesbank (2020) and Bohl et al. (2023). 


Monetary policy communication according to artificial intelligence
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 112MILA  also conducts a sentence-level analysis of the sentiment of an MPS  as a whole 
and determines whether it is positive, neutral or negative.  As discussed in the section 
entitled “ ”, the sentiment dimension is The role of communication in monetary policy
not to be conflated with the hawkishness or dovishness of monetary policy. For 
instance, a press conference might see the  Governing Council communicating in a ECB
hawkish and positive manner or in a hawkish and negative manner (for illustrations, 
see the supplementary information entitled “ ”). The Examples of classifications by MILA
sentiment metric therefore differs from the Hawk-O-Meter for the economic narrative 
described above. At this stage in the procedure,  again examines individual MILA
sentences, but this time they are classified as positive, neutral or negative. In order to 
ensure that the output focuses on the economic narrative, the entire  is taken into MPS
account, but statements without a direct reference to economic developments or 
monetary policy decisions are classed as neutral. Formula (1) is used to calculate the 
sentiment for the text as a whole: the indicator takes a value of -1 if the text contains 
only negative sentences and a value of +1 if the text contains only positive sentences. 
MILA  is also capable of analysing speeches given by members of the ECB Governing 
Council.  When doing so,  starts by examining whether the speech is related to MILA
monetary policy and thus whether it makes sense to attempt to characterise it in terms 
of hawkishness or dovishness.  Provided that a speech is deemed to be of a 
monetary policy nature,  then proceeds to generate the Hawk-O-Meter and the MILA
sentiment metric for the economic narrative according to the procedure described 
above. The classification process draws on the inflation context derived from  press ECB
conferences. A Decision Hawk-O-Meter can also be calculated, factoring in all sentences 
related directly to monetary policy instruments.   30) 
 31) 
30 Speeches of a non-monetary policy nature can generate misclassifications. See Bohl et al. (2023).
31 Evaluating speeches is a more complex and time-consuming exercise than evaluating press conferences. This 
is mainly due to the less standardised language, the large number of topic areas and varying text formats. 
Automated analysis is thus more difficult. In principle, however, the methodology described here is also 
suitable for handling other monetary policy texts, such as interviews or minutes of meetings (provided due 
consideration is given to their specific features).

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 1164 Hawkish or dovish? A Hawk-O-Meter for monetary 
policy communication
According to MILA , the economic narrative of the ECB Governing Council has been 
largely dovish since the end of 2011  (see Chart 4.3). The press conferences under  
Mario Draghi’s presidency (November 2011 to October 2019) are predominantly rated 
as particularly dovish. This period includes the European sovereign debt crisis, during 
which the Governing Council judged monetary policy transmission to be impaired and 
assessed the economic outlook as weak.  classifies the economic narrative as MILA
especially dovish around the time of Draghi’s “Whatever it takes” statement in 2012. 
The press conferences during the era of negative key interest rates and other uncon-
ventional monetary policy measures as of 2014 are also considered to be very dovish.
During this period, the Governing Council stressed the very low and, in some cases, 
negative inflation rates as well as the elevated risk of these dynamics becoming 
entrenched. The Governing Council’s press conferences at the start of the 19 COVID -
pandemic in early 2020, when Christine Lagarde was  President, are highly dovish ECB
according to  At the time, the  Governing Council stressed that the euro area MILA . ECB
was facing an economic contraction of a magnitude and speed unprecedented in peace-
time.  Overall, looking at the period from 2011 to 2021, it is particularly striking that 
the Hawk-O-Meters for inflation and the real economy exhibit strong correlation over 
large parts. This is consistent with a narrative of prolonged weakness in aggregate 
demand, associated downward pressure on inflation dynamics, and the need for highly 
accommodative monetary policy. 32)

Monetary policy communication according to artificial intelligence
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 117The economic narrative turned less dovish in 2021 and was hawkish during the 
period of monetary policy tightening between 2022 and 2023.  MILA  finds that the 
inflation narrative grew less dovish over the course of 2021. At the time, the  ECB
Governing Council highlighted the elevated rate of inflation, but considered this 
increase to be transitory. At the beginning of 2022, it revised its assessment in the light 
of unexpectedly strong rises in inflation rates; as a result, for the first time in around 
ten years, communication around inflation turned markedly and more persistently 
hawkish. The Hawk-O-Meter peaked in June 2022, when the Governing Council 
announced that the next meeting would see a first rise in key interest rates. The infla-
tion narrative remained highly hawkish until the end of 2022, when inflation in the euro 
area had surpassed the 10% mark. In 2023 and 2024, the inflation narrative gradually 
turned less hawkish. Most recently,  has characterised it as balanced. In contrast MILA
to the inflation narrative, the Governing Council’s communication concerning real 
economic developments remained predominantly dovish or – at most – balanced 
during this period. This kind of divergence in the narrative between inflation and the 
real economy indicates that, in the wake of the start of Russia’s war of aggression 
against Ukraine in February 2022, the  Governing Council primarily emphasised ECB
supply-side disruptions – with inflationary but growth-damaging effects. The rather 
dovish communication about the real economy since mid-2023 also reflects the struc-
tural weakness in growth in the euro area.  


Monetary policy communication according to artificial intelligence
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 118Ahead of the period of monetary policy tightening, the ECB Governing Council’s 
communication on monetary policy decisions was markedly more dovish than its 
inflation narrative  (see Chart 4.4). The Eurosystem concluded its strategy review in the 
summer of 2021.  On the back of this, the Governing Council modified its communica-
tion on the future trajectory of key interest rates, known as forward guidance. It under-
lined its intention to maintain a persistently accommodative monetary policy stance to 
achieve the inflation target, even if this might imply “a transitory period in which infla-
tion is moderately above target”.  classifies this communication as very dovish. The MILA
Governing Council remained markedly dovish in its direct communication on monetary 
policy decisions afterwards as well, especially in comparison with its inflation narrative.

ments to the key interest rates would take place “some time” after the end of net

Monetary policy communication according to artificial intelligence
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 119The inflation narrative and key interest rate communication signal the monetary 
policy stance and telegraph future key interest rate decisions.  The monetary policy 
stance in the euro area (see the supplementary information entitled “ Measuring the 
”) gradually became less accommodative at the end of 2021 (see monetary policy stance
Chart 4.4). At that point in time, the deposit facility rate still stood at -0.5%. However, 
prompted, amongst other things, by the  Governing Council’s hawkish communica-ECB
tion on the subject of inflation dynamics in its press conferences, market participants 
priced in a higher likelihood of an impending rise in key interest rates, pushing up 
longer-term market interest rates. The first key interest rate hike then came in July 
2022, half a year after communication had left dovish territory, with the Governing 
Council raising the deposit facility rate by 50 basis points from -0.5% to 0%. Over the 
rest of the monetary policy tightening cycle, communication continues to act as an 
indicator of developments to come: the Hawk-O-Meters for inflation and key interest 
rates peak around nine months ahead of the final key interest rate increase in Septem-
ber 2023. The reduction in the degree of monetary policy restriction in 2024 through 
four key interest rate cuts of 25 basis points each was also preceded by less hawkish 
communication. This makes clear that central banks utilise their communication in 
press conferences to signal future monetary policy decisions, both via the economic 
narrative and via the key interest rate path. 


Monetary policy communication according to artificial intelligence
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 120Since 2011, the tone of the ECB Executive Board’s monetary policy speeches has 
evolved in line with the ECB press conferences and the macroeconomic environ-
ment in the euro area.  MILA  finds that the public remarks made by the  Executive ECB
Board in the period from 2011 to 2021 were likewise predominantly dovish, with a clear 
pivot towards hawkish speeches at the start of 2022 (see Chart 4.5, left panel). The 
changes in the Hawk-O-Meter for monetary policy speeches can be attributed to macro-
economic developments in the euro area (see Table 4.2). The rates of inflation and  GDP
growth have statistically significant effects on the tone of speeches by the  Execu-ECB
tive Board: on average, the speeches become more hawkish when inflation or growth 
go up. The estimated coefficients are consistent with a conventional monetary policy 
rule whereby key interest rates are adjusted more strongly in response to inflation. This 
also tallies with the ’s price stability mandate. The results indicate that monetary ECB
policy decision-makers respond to current macroeconomic developments and signal 
their views with regard to future monetary policy decisions.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 1225 Positive or negative? A sentiment indicator for 
monetary policy communication
According to MILA , sentiment in ECB press conferences has been predominantly 
positive since 2011  (see Chart 4.6, left panel). Following the lowering of the deposit 
facility rate to 0% in July 2012,  records negative sentiment, which persisted until MILA
around the end of 2013. This primarily reflects a pessimistic narrative about economic 
dynamics in the context of the European sovereign debt crisis. By contrast, sentiment 
was broadly optimistic between 2014 and the end of Mario Draghi’s term as  Presi-ECB
dent in November 2019. The subsequent coronavirus pandemic was also reflected in
 press conferences: while the lockdowns in spring 2020 and winter 2020-21 went ECB
hand in hand with negative sentiment, the increasing prevalence of vaccines and the 
reopening of the economy in 2021 led to optimism.  shows a renewed phase of MILA
pessimism coinciding with Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and the sharp 
rise in inflation at the beginning of 2022. The  press conference in October 2022, in ECB
which the sentiment indicator reaches a low, is particularly striking. At that time, finan-
cial markets reacted in a highly dovish way, even though the  Governing Council ECB
raised the key interest rates by 75 basis points and did not change the key interest rate 
outlook.  indicates that this may be attributable to the extremely pessimistic MILA
communication. Since the last interest rate hike in September 2023, sentiment has 
gradually become more positive.

Monetary policy communication according to artificial intelligence
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 123A historical comparison of sentiment and the Hawk-O-Meter regarding the 
economic narrative shows that the two dimensions should not be considered equiva-
lent  (see Chart 4.6, right panel). According to  the economic narrative at the ’s   MILA , ECB
press conferences under President Draghi was generally dovish and balanced during 
the sovereign debt crisis. From the introduction of forward guidance in July 2013, 
however, communication was dovish and positive until the end of Draghi’s term of 
office. For 2014 to 2018, in particular, ’s assessment indicates satisfactory macroe- MILA
conomic developments overall, which were supported by the accommodative monetary 
policy. Three different phases can be identified during President Lagarde’s term of 
office. A very dovish tone and markedly negative sentiment is recorded for the coron-
avirus pandemic. Sentiment during the subsequent period of monetary policy tighten-
ing from 2022 to 2023 was also negative, but communication was hawkish overall. 
During the phase of the reduction in the degree of monetary policy restriction that 
began in 2024, the economic narrative is broadly balanced and slightly dovish. Accord-
ing to  a combination of markedly hawkish and positive communication has only MILA ,
occurred for a short time over the past 14 years, namely during four  press confer-ECB
ences in the second half of 2018.   


Monetary policy communication according to artificial intelligence
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 1246 Discussion and outlook
Artificial intelligence offers promising opportunities for improving the analysis of 
monetary policy texts and thus considerably promoting the understanding of the 
characteristics of monetary policy communication.  Using large language models, it is 
possible to evaluate different monetary policy texts from central banks in an 
automated and rules-based manner.  agents based on these models – such as  AI MILA
developed by the Bundesbank – also enable a detailed, transparent and multidimen-
sional analysis, which combines the flexibility of human assessments with the consis-
tency of formal methods. 
These advances in analysis are faced with challenges.  Interpreting and assessing 
monetary policy statements remains complex and context-dependent. In order to make 
an accurate assessment, communication must therefore be viewed in the context of 
the current economic situation, previous statements and the monetary policy stance. 
The risk of inaccurate assessments via automated systems continues to require careful 
checking and validation by human experts. In addition, it is essential to continuously 
adapt the employed models to new technical and linguistic developments as well as 
economic insights. This is the only way to ensure that  analysis remains useful and AI
sufficiently precise. 

Monetary policy communication according to artificial intelligence
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 125From a central bank perspective, integrating AI into the analysis of monetary policy 
texts holds the potential of improving central banks’ communication.  AI analyses 
can quantify the characteristics of monetary policy communication in a rules-based 
manner along various dimensions. Based on the quantitative indicators, it is possible to 
examine, for instance, the impact of these characteristics on financial market responses 
directly around the time of the communication. Systematic based analysis thus AI-
contributes to a deeper understanding of the perception and impact of monetary policy 
statements. For example, assisted text analysis can help central banks to improve AI-
their own communication. In particular,  could be used to check in advance whether AI
the tone of communication adequately conveys the intended monetary policy signals. 
This could help to avoid undesirable market reactions such as occurred in October 2022 
(see the section entitled “ Positive or negative? A sentiment indicator for monetary 
”). Such an improvement could increase the effectiveness and policy communication
accuracy of one of the most important monetary policy instruments. The increased 
efficiency and transparency of monetary policy communication resulting from this can 
ultimately help to strengthen the public’s trust in the central bank, anchor inflation 
expectations and thus fulfil the primary mandate of price stability.
However, the increasing prevalence of AI analyses among financial market players 
is also associated with risks.  If market participants increasingly use  to analyse AI
monetary policy statements and predict future decisions, their perceptions and inter-
pretations of central bank communication could become increasingly homogeneous. 
This would be the case particularly if financial market players used very similar  AI
models, relied primarily on  assessment for efficiency reasons and therefore invested AI
less in acquiring additional information. As financial markets provide incentives to antic-
ipate others’ assessments, market participants could increasingly align themselves with 
the based assessments of other actors.  As a result, market participants’ expecta- AI-
tion formation process, and thus the price discovery process, would be less efficient 
and associated with the risk of fragile market sentiment.  This could lead to increased 
volatility if market conditions changed unexpectedly rapidly or if the central bank made 
an unanticipated decision. 35)

Monetary policy communication according to artificial intelligence
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 126The availability of AI analyses may also make monetary policy communication more 
challenging for central banks.  It may become more difficult for central banks to get 
their messages through to their target human audience effectively if the latter increas-
ingly use  for interpretation. If central banks also use  to shape their communica- AI AI
tion, a scenario could arise in which machines end up communicating with other 
machines. This raises concerns about the effectiveness of monetary policy communica-
tion and the potential for feedback loops that could amplify market movements or lead 
to self-fulfilling expectations.  It is vital that market participants as well as central 
banks are aware of these possible implications. A critical examination of assisted AI-
analysis is essential to address these risks and ensure that central banks retain control 
over the impact of their monetary policy communication.  37)

Central securities depositories in Europe: sound foundations for the capital markets union
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 134Central securities depositories  ensure quick settlement and safe custody of securities ( ) CSDs
by operating securities accounts, providing central custodial services and offering services 
around dividend and interest payments, for example. As a critical post-trading infrastructure,
 perform a crucial function for the European financial system. This means they also CSDs
have an important role to play in further integrating capital markets in the  thus making EU,
them more efficient and competitive. Central banks, too, have a keen interest in  CSDs
functioning reliably, particularly from the vantage point of financial stability, not least 
because  are integral to the collateralisation of central bank monetary policy operations. CSDs
To account for the particular role of  the  established the Regulation on improving CSDs , EU
securities settlement in the  (the Central Securities Depositories Regulation, or  as an EU CSDR )
effective supervisory and oversight regime applicable to all EUCSDs .
The  landscape in the  has evolved over time and is fairly diverse, despite the euro CSD EU
being the bloc’s single currency. This is partly the outcome of the ’s unique legal character. EU
A variety of measures have been initiated in the past decades to dismantle the barriers 
obstructing cross-border European securities settlement. One notable example is the
Securities  settlement platform operated by the Eurosystem since 2015, which TARGET2 - ()T2S
has helped to remove numerous technical obstacles. Furthermore, a clear tendency towards 
consolidation is evident among  Europe stands out in the global  landscape by EUCSDs . CSD

more of a cross-border remit. Given that changes in this setting are more likely to come 
about as a result of evolution than through radical realignment, at least in the short and 
medium term, it would be appropriate to continue the current path of market-driven integra-
tion and consolidation. It is a journey that could also see the role and use of  being T2S
strengthened further. On a supplementary note, the momentum surrounding the capital 
markets union should be leveraged, especially in terms of ongoing digitalisation, to 
harmonise the national differences that still persist in terms of tax and securities legislation 
or to mitigate this fragmentation by implementing an optional, European special regime for 
large-scale issues, for example.

Central securities depositories in Europe: sound foundations for the capital markets union
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 135New technologies such as tokenisation and distributed ledger technology  could, over ()DLT
the long run, transform the structure of securities settlement and the role that  play CSDs
both globally and in Europe. Central banks, policymakers and market participants are 
engaged in dialogue and should agree as early as possible on a longer-term vision for settle-
ment one decade from now and the necessary steps that lead there. From today’s perspec-
tive, however, it is inevitable that conventional and innovative structures like  will coexist DLT
for some time to come. At the same time, it is important for an adequate regulatory frame-
work to be in place to ensure that settlement remains safe and secure, even in a new techni-
cal landscape.

Central securities depositories in Europe: sound foundations for the capital markets union
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 1361 Importance of central securities depositories
Central securities depositories ( ) CSDs  are critical to the efficient functioning of the 
financial system and are systemically important to financial markets.  Historically,
 were established to mitigate risk in the post-trade domain and increase the CSDs
efficiency of settlement and custody. When securities are issued,  perform a kind CSDs
of notary function and ensure that the securities issued are registered correctly.  They 
offer securities accounts, central custodial services and other securities services, which 
can also include services surrounding corporate actions (such as dividend distributions 
and interest income) and repayments of bonds.  In addition, they ensure that securi-
ties are transferred quickly and safely by operating securities settlement systems. Thus,
 provide services at every stage of a security’s lifetime. Furthermore, they offer CSDs
other services, for example in the areas of collateral management and securities 
lending transactions. Hence, they make an important contribution to the stability and 
security of the financial system. 1)

Central securities depositories in Europe: sound foundations for the capital markets union
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 137Immobilising physical securities for the whole (domestic) market is one of the key 
efficiency gains that CSDs  have unlocked.  Immobilisation meant that the arduous task 
of moving physical certificates from one depository to another was eliminated. As  CSDs
generally keep the securities entrusted to them as collective holdings, with the respec-
tive securities account holders each having a suitably documented share of those 
holdings and share transfers taking place by “book entry settlement”, this arrangement 
is often also known as “collective safe custody”. The first immobilisation of securities in 
central institutions to facilitate settlement without physical delivery took place at the 
end of the 19th century in Germany; these institutions were called . Kassenvereine
Historically,  were set up in many countries by, or under the leadership of, national CSDs
authorities such as the central bank or the finance ministry. This public involvement 
was seen to be justified because  were regarded as critical service providers CSDs
operating in a market environment characterised by significant economies of scale and 
scope (network effects). Most European  have been taken into private ownership CSDs
since financial markets were liberalised in the 1980s and 1990s. According to World 
Bank data, in 2022, 41 out of 107  worldwide were operated by central banks, and CSDs
66 by the private sector; in high-income  countries, almost 80% of  were OECD CSDs
operated by private stakeholders.
The international dimension is becoming increasingly important for CSDs  in the EU. 
CSDs  catered for their own national financial markets exclusively, to begin with. Over 
time, in the case of cross-border securities transactions,  used their links with other CSDs
 to also enable the delivery of securities issued in other markets via that country’s CSDs
 For this purpose, domestic  open accounts with foreign  and usually CSD. CSDs CSDs
become ordinary participants in that country’s settlement process. Since the early 
1970s, Europe has also been home to two international  which take care of CSDs ( ), ICSDs

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 138Custody chains and securities settlement in the EU encompass both CSDs  and custo-
dian banks.  CSDs  occupy a prominent position in the securities settlement ecosystem 
over the entire life cycle of a security. However, custodians and other professional 
market players play a major role in this regard as well. To wit, it is usually local or global 
custodians that act as participants and account holders with  and deposit both CSDs
their customers’ and their own holdings there.  Incidentally, banks are not obliged to 
hold their holdings themselves with a  but can also engage another custodian for CSD,
this purpose. This option is very popular in international business because the custo-
dian abroad is able to provide a tailored service, like in terms of tax treatment or corpo-
rate actions over the lifetime of a given security. As  too, have broadened their CSDs ,

pants has undergone change, especially at large international custodians. Furthermore, 
keys relationships exist between (I)  and national central banks (see Chart 5.1). CSDs

some countries where customer holdings can also be held in segregated accounts at the  (end-investor CSD
model).

Central securities depositories in Europe: sound foundations for the capital markets union
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 139The CSD ecosystem in the EU and the financial market infrastructures they operate 
provide stable and efficient technical foundations for the European capital market.  
However, those foundations are still very much structured along national borders. This 
fragmentation hampers capital market-based financing for enterprises and risk sharing 
across national borders, amongst other things. This situation would be remedied by the 
capital markets union. Measures surrounding this initiative have been discussed 
recently, like in the recent Letta and Draghi reports for the  which also address insti-EU,
tutional topics (such as the structure of supervision) and infrastructural aspects.
1.1 Regulation, supervision and oversight of  in the European CSDs

As systemically important infrastructure, CSDs  are crucial to the stability and 
efficiency of financial markets.  are characterised by the following features. CSDs
When securities are issued, they perform a kind of notary function and ensure that the 
securities issued are registered correctly; they operate trading or settlement systems 
that are generally considered critical; they exhibit significant economies of scale; they 
provide services that benefit a great many market participants; they are subject to 
government involvement or influence.  The systemic importance of  has resulted CSDs
in their activities being subjected to particular regulation, supervision and oversight. 6)

Central securities depositories in Europe: sound foundations for the capital markets union
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 141The CSDR  is the single European regime for the supervision of CSDs . The  trans- CSDR
posed what had been a fairly non-binding regulatory framework for the risk-oriented 
monitoring of financial market infrastructures, including by central banks ( / CPMI IOSCO
Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures), and the previously national supervisory 
frameworks governing  (as covered in Germany by the Banking Act), into a legally CSDs
binding European regime. The Regulation defines a harmonised regulatory framework 
in the  setting out requirements for the  and providing a single supervisory and EU, CSDs

must be authorised and supervised by the competent authorities of their home

Moreover, the  defines capital requirements. These exist to ensure that  have CSDR CSDs
sufficient financial resources to manage their operational and systemic risks. Further-
more, the Regulation introduced rules to encourage and incentivise the timely settle-
ment of securities transactions, including measures in the event of late settlement, 
such as cash penalties and, if necessary, mandatory buy-ins, to prevent a settlement fail 
(e.g. because the seller was unable to deliver the securities). 10)

cross-border securities business in the EU. The  requires  to cooperate, for CSDR CSDs

Furthermore, the Regulation supports the dematerialisation and immobilisation of 
securities. It does so, amongst other things, by establishing harmonised standards and 
procedures for securities settlement and custody, but also by setting appropriate 
requirements for securities issuers. Besides that, obliging  to disclose information CSDs

1.2 Relationship between central banks and CSDs
There are multiple key points of interaction between central banks and CSDs , which 
is why the safe and smooth functioning of CSDs  is of particular interest to the 
Eurosystem.  Generally speaking, the relationship between central banks and  is CSDs
characterised by cooperation and regulation. There are some central banks, such as the 
National Bank of Belgium and the  Federal Reserve, which also operate  of their US CSDs
own. Central banks have a great interest in  functioning reliably, specifically in CSDs
terms of their role in aggregate financial stability, and perform an oversight function in 
this context.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 143On top of this,  have an important role to play in the collateralisation of central CSDs
bank monetary policy operations, such as intraday or overnight credit. For example, 
securities held by banks with a  can be pledged as collateral for such operations. CSD
And last but not least, central banks provide services for settlement in central bank 
money. This is safer and more liquid than commercial bank money, making it the

to eliminate settlement risk (say, for example, if the buyer has already paid but does

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 1452 The  landscape in EuropeCSD
The fact that there are more than 25 different CSDs  in the EU can be explained by 
their historical origins and development.  Almost all  were set up as institutions CSDs
that initially centralised the safe custody of securities in a specific national market. 
Consolidation across national borders was hampered in particular by differences in 
national laws governing securities and tax matters. In addition, just over 50 years ago, 
two  – today known as Euroclear Bank and Clearstream Banking Luxembourg – ICSDs
were established, primarily for securities that were deliberately not issued under the 
respective national legal system, that were often denominated in  dollars and that US
were aimed more at international investors.
Chart 5.2 shows the ten largest  in the  as measured by the value of securities CSDs EU
under custody in 2023. Securities held in safe custody at Euroclear Bank (Belgium) were 
valued at €18.5 trillion in 2023. This was followed by Clearstream Banking  AG
(Germany), at €11.9 trillion, and Clearstream Banking Luxembourg, at €10.1 trillion. 
Other significant  are Euroclear France (France), with €9.4 trillion worth of securi- CSDs

Iberclear (Spain) with €2.5 trillion. 19)

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 146The prominent role of some CSDs  is also reflected in the value of the annual transac-
tions processed and the number of participants.  In 2023, the value of all delivery 
instructions at Euroclear Bank (Belgium) amounted to €746.2 trillion – an exceptionally 
high amount by international standards (see Chart 5.3). This means that Euroclear Bank 
(Belgium) was the most active  in the world in terms of the value of transactions CSD

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 150The emergence of Euroclear dates back to the late 1960s, when the Brussels branch of 
the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York founded the Euroclear system.  
The system was developed to simplify the settlement of cross-border securities transac-
tions and to minimise associated risks, in particular with regard to Eurobonds. These 
are European bonds issued outside the country in whose currency they are denomi-
nated.  The creation of Euroclear and the introduction of computerised systems were 
responses to the rapid growth of the Eurobond market in the 1960s and the associated 
challenges in settling securities transactions. Euroclear Bank was established in 2000 
and acquired numerous national  in the years that followed.  Euroclear is CSDs
privately owned, with the largest shareholders coming from France (just under 30%), 
Belgium (13%) and New Zealand (9%). An investment company owned by the Chinese 
central bank holds a further 7%.
Cedel (Centrale de Livraison de Valeurs Mobilières) was launched in 1970 in response to 
the same market needs and with the same objective as Euroclear by a group of 
investors comprising a total of 66 large international banks.  In 2000, Cedel merged 
with Deutsche Börse Clearing  the settlement division of Deutsche Börse, to form AG,
Clearstream and what is today Clearstream Banking Luxembourg, the  of the ICSD
Deutsche Börse Group. Deutsche Börse is a listed company with a broad international 
group of shareholders. The German  Clearstream Banking  and the Luxembourg CSD AG
 LuxCSD are also owned by Deutsche Börse.CSD 24)

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 151The ICSDs  Euroclear Bank and Clearstream Banking Luxembourg play a special role 
in the European and international financial system.  They deal, amongst other things, 
with settlement in foreign currencies and act as overarching hubs for international 
investors in Europe. Their customer base and services, which include securities lending 
and collateral management, for example, are global in scope, albeit now with a 
stronger European focus, especially in the Eurobonds segment.  The concept of an

investors outside of Europe (mainly in the United States); at the same time, 68% of all Eurobonds were from 
European issuers and, accordingly, 32% from non-European issuers (mainly in the United States).

2.2 Discussions on  structures in EuropeCSD
The fact that there are more than 25 different CSDs  in the EU is often interpreted as 
an indication that the European settlement landscape is fissured, poorly integrated 
and inferior to that of other currency areas in terms of costs, settlement efficiency 
and investor access to the European capital market.  This discussion is currently 
also taking place in the broader context of the capital markets union. The objective of 
the capital markets union is to facilitate cross-border investment and attract more

tion of European investment products and changes in capital market supervision, the 
need for infrastructure consolidation is another matter that has been raised, not least 
with reference to market structures in the United States. In this context, it should first 
be borne in mind that the  is an entity that has developed over time and lacks the EU
characteristics of a centralised state. This means, for example, that the  Member EU
States have separate legal systems with some material differences. There have already 
been various initiatives, especially since the introduction of the euro as a single 
currency (now encompassing 20 Member States), to bring about greater integration of 
the European capital market and European post-trading infrastructure. 31) 
 32) 
31 The term global certificate or collective certificate is used to describe a security in which the rights of a 
number of creditors of a bond issue or a number of shareholders of a share issue are uniformly securitised. 
This significantly simplifies the safe custody of securities, as there is no longer a need for physical certificates.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 155The barriers identified in the Giovannini Reports from 2001 and 2003 are of key 
importance here.  The group led by Alberto Giovannini with broad market expertise 
identified 15 barriers to greater post-trade integration, which can be sub-divided into 
three areas: (i) national differences in technical requirements/market practice; (ii) 
national differences in tax procedures; (iii) and national differences in securities legisla-
tion.  Subsequently, attempts were made to remove the identified barriers both

the vast majority of transactions in  are still settled within individual  (“intra- T2S CSDs
”); in 2023 this amounted to 97.7% of transactions in unit terms and 96.6% of trans-CSD

accounted for only a very small share of all transactions. 33)

 35) 
33 See European Commission (2016).

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 156 However, as explained above, it should be borne in mind that the function of  is CSDs
heavily influenced by economies of scale and that there have been considerable moves 
to consolidate this space in recent years. The fact that integration was often initially 
aimed solely at company law aspects is not surprising given the high costs involved in 
technical system integration. Participants, too, often cling to traditional settlement 
practices for longer, partly because of the different (national) legal frameworks. For 
example, a substantial part of cross-border securities settlement is likely to continue to 
take place via custodian banks rather than  especially in transactions in foreign  T2S, ()EU
markets. The interplay between the  and  is likely to improve further thanks to ICSDs T2S

Euroclear Bank.
After more than 20 years, many of the identified barriers to better integration in the 
post-trade sector have yet to be eliminated despite T2S, say market participants.  
Further deepening of the capital markets union is therefore likely to depend to a 
greater extent on further harmonisation of tax, company, insolvency and securities law. 
At the same time, efforts to integrate the market sector should also be further pursued. 
Moreover, this is also likely to benefit the issuance of securities in Europe, as the 
current issuance process is strongly geared to the respective national context. Against 
this background, the European Commission, with the support of the Eurosystem, has 
launched its own wide issuance service (see the supplementary information on theEU-
 Issuance Service).EU

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 1582.3 Recent developments in connection with digitalisation
Technological innovations have the potential to fundamentally alter Europe’s post-
trade infrastructure in the coming years.  Tokenisation and distributed ledger technol-
ogy  may take on a special role in this process. Tokenisation can be defined as the ( )DLT
digital representation of an asset, including the rights and obligations it confers and 
the transferability this makes possible. In order to classify a financial instrument as a 
security, the tradability criterion must likewise be met.  Conceptually, one can distin-
guish between two types of tokenisation. First, there is digital representation, which is 
already possible for conventionally issued securities. Second, tokens can be used to 
generate purely digital securities. In Germany, for example, crypto-securities can be 
generated pursuant to the Electronic Securities Act (Gesetz über elektronische Wertpa-
piere), which was introduced in 2021.  The use of tokenisation could lead to signifi-
cant efficiency gains in the post-trade domain.
In the future, tokenisation could, from a technical perspective, significantly shorten 
the currently long custody chains between issuers and investors, which also involve 
local and global custodian banks and CSDs  for instance.  In addition, smart contracts 
could be used to make asset servicing (such as the distribution of dividends) more 
efficient.  The use of  could allow both investors and issuers to use a single DLT
source of truth, which is likely to significantly reduce the need for coordination and the 
errors that are prone to occur during this coordination. The use of  generally allows DLT
an “atomic settlement” – in other words, the instant and simultaneous (final) settlement 
of both legs of a fully digital securities transaction using a smart contract (this might 
even take place in a joint process step with the conclusion of the underlying transac-
tion). This short overview illustrates that  could fundamentally change the role of DLT
today’s market participants in the ecosystem, including CSDs . 37)

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 159The tokenisation of securities through DLT has the potential to reduce the costs and 
complexity of settlement and custody.  Many observers assume that value-added 
chains in the securities sector will become noticeably more efficient through the use of 
distributed control and access rights, and that intermediaries, in particular, will have to 
adapt to a significantly changed environment. However, any transition to token-based 
systems is unlikely to take place abruptly. On the contrary, the level of efficiency 
already achieved, the cooperation needed among the various market players and the 
not inconsiderable investment required mean that the transition is likely to be long 
term and fairly gradual. In the meantime, there will need to be interoperability between 
today’s account-based systems and the new infrastructures built on token structures. In 
May 2024, the three major central securities depositories, based Depository Trust US-
and Clearing Corporation  and Europe's Clearstream and Euroclear, published ( ) DTCC

compliance, resilience and security, safeguarding customer assets, connectivity and 
interoperability, as well as operational scalability.  The objective is to initiate an inter-
national debate on the framework and standards for based settlement and DLT-
custody of securities. 40)

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 1603 Outlook
Technical innovations, regulatory changes and market-driven developments will 
continue to innovatively alter European securities developments in the coming 
years.  It should be borne in mind that trading and settlement systems represent the 
“rail network” of the capital market, figuratively speaking. Changes, say in the product 
range or at upstream process stages, can therefore also impact settlement systems. In 
particular, there are currently plans to reduce the time span between trading and settle-
ment from currently up to two business days (known as settlement on “T+2”) to one 
business day (“T+1”), thereby making the financial markets in the  more modern and EU
efficient overall.
After the time between the execution and settlement of transactions was reduced to 
one business day in the United States, Canada and Mexico in May 2024 and a similar 
step was announced in the United Kingdom, the  also took the policy decision to EU
shorten the settlement cycle for (exchange-traded) transactions from T+2 to T+1.  ESMA

account the complex situation within the  In February 2025, the European Commis-EU.

sponding projects in Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The potential benefits of a 
migration are expected to include lower counterparty and market risk as transactions 
are open for a shorter period of time as well as less need for collateral to be posted 
(where settlement is conducted using a central counterparty). A reduction to T+1 will 
require a significant concentration, in particular, of the necessary process steps 
upstream of settlement, thus leading to considerable adjustments at the affected 
market participants. In the settlement systems themselves, there could, for instance, be 
changes in the timing of delivery patterns, which may require additional investment. 
The ongoing project work within the  is being managed and coordinated under the EU

areas, the technical transition work will mainly be carried out by the respective market 
and industry players.

Central securities depositories in Europe: sound foundations for the capital markets union
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 161The changeover to T+1 will require considerable efforts from all market participants 
over the coming years. However, this must not be allowed to lead to any let-up in 
efforts to further integrate the post-trade infrastructure. For example, the current 
momentum to deepen the capital markets union should also, in particular, be 
channelled into further concrete efforts to harmonise tax, corporate, insolvency and, 
more generally, securities legislation. One option would be to provide the market with 
the choice of a special European regime – for larger issues, for example.
Given that structures have evolved historically and perform well and in view of the 
existing framework conditions, the idea, occasionally mooted, of significantly reduc-
ing the number of central securities depositories operating in Europe is not very 
realistic for the time being.  In any case, such a step would require comprehensive 
harmonisation of tax and securities law. In addition, a wide range of regulatory, legal 
and – in view of ownership structures – company law issues would arise. It therefore 
appears beneficial to continue with the market-driven consolidation approach. To this 
end, competition between central securities depositories should be further increased, 
for example by further intensifying the use of  In particular, cross-border settle-T2S.
ment between the central securities depositories participating in  should be further T2S
promoted, by completing mutual ties, amongst other things.

Central securities depositories in Europe: sound foundations for the capital markets union
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 162The potential of tokenisation and DLT must be rigorously explored and developed.  
For one thing, the Eurosystem should, even in the short term, provide a range of 
services allowing the settlement of based securities transactions in central bank DLT-
money via appropriate interoperability interfaces.  Moreover, a dialogue with all 
relevant market participants should be launched quickly on what digital securities 
settlement might look like over the next decade, taking into account the experiences of 
the past 20 years. This includes considering whether – like with  – the objective T2S
could be a common  infrastructure and what exactly its design should look like. In DLT
any case, steps must be taken to ensure that all risk categories relating to settlement, 
some of which may have changed, are effectively limited through an appropriate 
regulatory framework even if new technologies are used. In today’s structure, for 
instance, this framework is provided by the  in particular. In this respect, specific CSDR ,
roles and functions that are subject to a specific regulatory regime will also have to be 
defined in the future European securities settlement ecosystem. Above all, work at the 
European level on common digital securities legislation should be initiated as quickly as 
possible in order to overcome any potential further fragmentation.

German balance of payments in 2024
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 167In 2024, the German current account surplus increased slightly by ¼ percentage point to ¾5
% of nominal gross domestic product ( ).GDP  It thus remained below the peaks of previous 
years. Exports decreased, even though sales markets expanded. At the same time, demand 
for imports remained weak, as investment was on a moderate path. All in all, though, the 
sub-balances of the current account in 2024 were little changed against the previous year. 
The balance of trade in goods was virtually unchanged, and the deficit in the services 
account widened slightly but was more than offset by higher balances for primary and 
secondary income. In line with the current account balance, the balance of savings and 
investment (aggregate net lending/net borrowing) was also virtually unchanged. Enterprises 
saved less as higher staff costs reduced their profits. At the same time, investment was 
dampened by weak demand as well as structural and cyclical factors. High financing and 
construction costs were also a drag on housing investment. Households increased their 
savings, as their consumption remained subdued despite rising real incomes. The general 
government deficit widened slightly, mainly as a result of one-off tax refunds. 
In keeping with the slightly increased current account surplus, the financial account also 
closed with a somewhat higher balance in 2024 than in the previous year. There were two 
factors driving developments in its sub-accounts: first, the ongoing cyclical weakness in 
Germany, also when compared to other countries. This was reflected in further declining 
direct investment flows and rising net capital exports of mutual fund shares and stocks. The 
second factor was the final stop to Eurosystem asset purchases, coupled with slightly looser 
(albeit still restrictive) monetary policy. One of the outcomes of this combination was a 
smaller scarcity premium for German Federal bonds. Accordingly, foreign investors signifi-
cantly increased their holdings of these securities, which are deemed to be particularly safe. 
The strong demand for German debt securities from other European countries also meant 
that the German  balance did not fall as sharply as would actually have been TARGET
expected given the maturing asset purchases of the Eurosystem.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 1681 Current account
1.1 Underlying trends in the current account
The German current account surplus increased slightly in 2024.  It rose by €14 billion 
to €246½ billion. The balance increased by ¼ percentage point to 5¾% of nominal  GDP .
The surplus thus remained high, but is still well below its peaks prior to the outbreak of 
war in Ukraine and the coronavirus pandemic.
The sub-balances of the current account changed only marginally in 2024.  The goods 
trade balance remained broadly stable, since exports contracted despite growing sales 
markets and imports declined as a result of subdued investment. The deficit in the 
services account widened marginally, but was more than offset by slight increases in 
the balances of primary and secondary income. All in all, the sub-balances of the  
current account in 2024 were little changed against the previous year.


German balance of payments in 2024
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 169The global setting remained subdued in 2024.  Growth in the global economy was 
stable but below average. Central banks’ tight monetary policy led to a drop in inflation 
rates in many countries. However, demand continued to suffer given higher financing 
costs, and fiscal support measures were phased out. According to CPB Netherlands 
Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis, the volume of global trade grew moderately by 
1¾%, having declined in the previous year. The euro appreciated marginally in 2024, 
which put a slight damper on Germany’s price competitiveness. Global market prices 
for commodities, particularly natural gas and other energy imports, continued to 
decline slightly, but on average remained above the long-term average.
The value of the foreign trade surplus rose slightly in 2024, mainly due to price 
effects.  Import prices for commodities, especially energy, fell slightly, whilst export 
prices remained broadly stable. This led to a marginal year-on-year improvement in 
Germany’s terms of trade. In terms of volume, by contrast, the balance barely changed. 
Real imports and real exports both decreased by more or less the same amount.

German balance of payments in 2024
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 171In the year under review, aggregate net lending/net borrowing (the balance of 
saving and investment) remained broadly unchanged relative to GDP . Looking 
beyond that, however, there were opposing developments in the individual sector 
accounts. Non-financial corporations’ savings declined significantly, particularly owing 
to higher staff costs. At the same time, net investment relative to  decreased, but GDP
not as much as savings. On the one hand, the ongoing weakness of the export industry 
and subdued domestic demand were a hindrance. On the other hand, structural factors 
depressed investment. In addition, housing investment continued to decline, pushed 
down by high financing and construction costs. Households significantly increased their 
savings as private consumption remained subdued in spite of rising real incomes. Politi-
cal and economic uncertainties as well as the gloomier labour market situation 
dampened the propensity to consume. The general government funding deficit 
widened marginally. Even though the energy price brakes were no longer in place, the 
deficit ratio remained virtually unchanged due to the countervailing effect of higher 
spending on defence, climate action, personnel, interest and social security schemes. 1) 
1 Mathematical differences between the current account balance (including capital transfers) and aggregate net 
lending/net borrowing may occur due to different statistical sources, calculation methods and revision dates.

The German current account surplus vis-à-vis the United 
States
Bilateral trade imbalances once again became the focus of economic policy discus-
sions under the new US administration.  It is considering massive tariff increases with 
the intention of, amongst other things, reducing the  current account deficit.  On US
an average of the first three quarters of 2024, this stood at 3¾% of  compared with GDP ,
2% in 2019. The bulk of the current account deficit is attributable to trade in goods and 
services. At the bilateral level, the United States recorded its largest deficit in trade in 
goods and services in 2024 vis-à-vis China, followed by Mexico, Vietnam and Germany. 
The  trade deficit with Germany has remained broadly stable over the past few years, US
at ¼% of  economic output.  Arithmetically, around one-tenth of the United States’ US
total trade deficit was attributable to Germany.
The United States was Germany’s main trading partner in 2024.  The United States 
ranks first among the customer countries for German goods and third in terms of 
suppliers.
Germany’s current account surplus vis-à-vis the United States was significantly 
higher in 2024 than during President Trump’s first term of office.  This was mainly 
due to the higher goods account surplus. Germany’s foreign trade balance vis-à-vis the 
United States stood at around €70 billion (1¾% of German  in 2024, having GDP )
amounted to €47½ billion (1¼% of  in 2019. This made it Germany’s largest bilat- GDP )  
eral surplus.   1)

to apply as from April 2025.
2 Between 2019 and 2024, the bilateral current account deficit of the United States vis-à-vis Germany rose 
marginally, from slightly over ½% to just under ¼% of  economic output at last count.US
3 In 2024, Germany’s surplus in trade in goods vis-à-vis the United States, which comprises merchanting and 
trade in non-monetary gold in addition to supplementary trade items, was even larger than the foreign trade 
surplus, at around €76½ billion.

German balance of payments in 2024
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 173From both the sectoral and net perspectives, Germany recorded a particularly high 
export surplus vis-à-vis the United States for motor vehicles and parts and machin-
ery as well as for pharmaceutical products and electrical equipment in 2024.  These 
rank among the products that make up a large share of total German exports to the 
United States, and are significant for individual industrial sectors. These sectors would 
thus be especially hard-hit by new tariffs.


German balance of payments in 2024
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 174Imports of energy products from the United States dampened the bilateral foreign 
trade surplus.  This has particularly been the case with oil, gas and coal imports since 
the start of the war on Ukraine. Import contributions from other transport equipment 
(especially in the aerospace industry) up to 2023 also had an impact here. Furthermore, 
the United States is of above-average importance as a supplier of pharmaceutical 
products. Imports from the United States account for around one-sixth of all German 
pharmaceutical imports, although Germany also has an overall surplus vis-à-vis the 
United States in this category of goods.
In 2024, Germany’s services surplus vis-à-vis the United States barely contributed to 
the corresponding current account surplus.  Between 2016 and 2020, the surplus in 
bilateral trade in services stood at around €3 billion to €4 billion. It increased almost 
fivefold in 2021 in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. This was due to a rapid rise in 
receipts, particularly from intellectual property, with receipts from the development of 
vaccines playing a key role. The surplus remained relatively high in 2022, too. In 2023, 
however, it more than halved, mainly due to a considerable drop in receipts (also attrib-
utable to receipts from vaccine development no longer being received) which contin-
ued into 2024. At around €3½ billion in 2024, the volume of the services surplus was 
roughly the same as it was during President Trump’s first term of office.


German balance of payments in 2024
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 175Trade in services with US companies is often conducted via their European 
subsidiaries, which makes it difficult to allocate it directly to the United States.  In the
 sector, in particular, trade is often settled via countries such as Ireland, where manyIT
 firms have their European head offices. This is supported by the fact that the ’s US EU
bilateral balance in services trade vis-à-vis the United States is deep in negative terri-
tory, while the bilateral balances of the largest Member States vis-à-vis the United 
States (e.g. Germany, France and Italy) are all positive. 
In 2024, the primary income balance made a considerable contribution to Germany’
s surplus vis-à-vis the United States.  This had risen sharply since 2022, mainly owing 
to higher receipts from other investment income (including interest from bank 
balances). However, the funds that flowed from this primary income item to the United 
States also increased. This suggests that making financial investments in the United 
States was considered an attractive option. In 2024, net receipts in primary income 
totalled around €24½ billion.  This figure was considerably higher than before, but still 
made up approximately one-quarter of the current account surplus.   
Trade balances alone do not indicate whether a country is benefiting from or being 
disadvantaged by trade.  Focusing on comparative advantages allows countries to 
benefit from trade together. These benefits cannot be inferred from bilateral balances. 
Although tariffs can influence bilateral balances, they usually have no lasting impact on 
the overall trade balance due to trade diversion effects.  This is also evidenced by the 
development of the  trade balance since 2018. Although the bilateral deficit in trade US
with China has fallen significantly since then in the wake of trade disputes, the  trade US
deficit has continued to rise overall. Trade deficits are always influenced by a number of 
macroeconomic factors such as households’ propensity to consume, the role of a 
currency as a reserve currency, and demand for a country’s assets.

balance.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 1761.2 Goods flows and trade balance
Price-adjusted foreign trade weakened again on an annual average.  Goods exports 
and imports both declined (by 1½% and 1¾% respectively) in line with the persistent 
weakness of the economy. Nominal exports fell almost as sharply as price-adjusted 
exports. Imports saw a noticeably steeper decline in terms of value than in real terms 
because the prices of intermediate goods and, in particular, of energy products fell. On 
balance, the foreign trade surplus increased by €21½ billion to €239 billion.
In regional terms, the German export industry recorded marked revenue losses in 
exports to the euro area, while deliveries to third countries declined only slightly 
overall.  Meanwhile, exports to Germany’s most significant trading partners within the 
euro area fell significantly. In contrast to this, exports to other important sales markets 
in Europe and to the United States saw a marked expansion. Deliveries to Japan were 
also up strongly. Exports to Ukraine increased considerably, which was attributable to 
goods delivered in connection with the war.  Exports to Russia, which remained 
subject to  sanctions, continued to dwindle from an already very low level. Substan-EU
tial revenue cuts were recorded in exports to other sales markets in South and East 
Asia. Sales to China fell particularly sharply, with motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts 
playing a considerable role (see the ). supplementary information on China 2) 
2 These deliveries included military goods, dual-use goods, and relief aid totalling €7.1 billion; see Federal 
Government (2025). However, in the context of total German exports, the significance of exports to Ukraine 
remains very low, accounting for ½%.

Recent developments in German exports to China
Germany’s exports to China by value declined considerably more rapidly than its 
exports as a whole in 2023 and 2024.  While German exports to China moved roughly 
in step with total German exports between 2011 and 2015, between 2015 and 2019, 
exports to China grew at a much faster pace across a wide range of sectors.  They 
have not had similarly high growth rates since then. Since 2023 – with the special 
factors caused by the 19 pandemic and Russia's war of aggression against COVID -
Ukraine no longer affecting German exports to China – German deliveries to China by 
value have fallen very sharply and considerably more rapidly than total German exports.
 China’s share of total German exports declined from 7¼% in 2019 to 5¾% in 2024. As 
a result, China slid to fifth place in the ranking of export destinations, from third place 
in 2019.  1) 
 2) 
1 While in nominal terms, German exports to China were 10% higher in 2015 than in 2011, they expanded by 
34¾% between 2015 and 2019. Particularly strong contributions to growth came from motor vehicles and 
motor vehicle parts, data processing equipment and electronic products, machinery, electrical equipment, and 
pharmaceutical products.
2 Exports to China increased very sharply in 2021, in step with the rapidly expanding Chinese economy; 
however, in the catch-up process following the pandemic-related collapse in 2020, German exports as a whole 
grew even more strongly. The pace of exports to China slowed in 2022 due to the relatively moderate growth 
of the Chinese economy, which had also been impacted by the rigid measures taken there to contain the
19 pandemic. COVID -

German balance of payments in 2024
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 179The sharp declines in exports to China in 2023 and 2024 were driven above all by a 
fall in exports of motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts.  Exports of this product 
category by value, which have a particularly high weighting in German exports to 
China, decreased quite considerably in both years, by 18% and 17¼% respectively. The 
rapid transformation of the Chinese automotive market towards electromobility played 
an important role in this context. This segment is dominated by Chinese providers, 
while German manufacturers have so far achieved only very small shares of the market. 
As a result, German manufacturers faced significant declines in sales figures in China. 
This adversely impacted not only production in China itself, but also German motor 
vehicle exports to China.

German balance of payments in 2024
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 180Germany’s exports of other industrial goods to China have also dropped signifi-
cantly in recent years – broadly in line with those of other exporting countries.  The 
reason was China’s relatively subdued economic activity. Another important factor was 
likely that China has made strong gains in competitiveness in many areas and can now 
itself manufacture many of the products that it had previously bought from other 
countries.  Against this backdrop, growth in Chinese import demand for industrial 
goods has been rather sluggish in recent years, although Germany does not seem to 
have been affected much worse than other exporting countries.   
The sharp falls in exports to China in 2023 and 2024 are being felt in the German 
export industry.  This applies in particular when compared with the high growth rates 
in exports to China during the years before the pandemic. The lack of exports to China 
is weighing particularly on the German automotive industry, which is having to deal 
with considerable problems as it is. In 2022, about 12% of all German exports of motor 
vehicles and motor vehicle parts still went to China. In 2024, this had dropped to 7¾%. 
Developments in total German motor vehicle exports during the past two years (+10¼% 
in 2023 and -2½% in 2024 respectively) were therefore significantly depressed – by 2¼ 
percentage points and 1½ percentage points respectively – by the drop in deliveries to 
China.  The dampening effect of Chinese demand on other industrial products was 
mostly small. Across the range of products as a whole, the sharp fall in deliveries to 
China shaved about ½ percentage point a year off total German export growth.   4) 
 5) 
 6) 
4 In this context, competitive pressure from Chinese companies on global markets increased significantly for 
German exporters. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2024b).
5 Germany’s share of total Chinese imports of manufactured goods went down from 6.8% in 2022 to 6.1% in 
2024. Excluding automotive vehicles, there was only a slight decline from 5.4% to 5.1%.
6 German automotive companies will probably have been even worse affected by the downturn in sales of their 
vehicles produced in China than by declining exports to China. They had made considerable investments in 
production facilities in China in the past. Although these investments were very profitable for a long time, the 
profits generated by them have fallen significantly in recent years. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2024a).

German balance of payments in 2024
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 181 
In terms of the product mix, price-adjusted exports of capital goods and numerous 
intermediate goods decreased, whereas deliveries of consumer goods increased.  
Exports of motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts saw a steep drop. This was due to 
declining revenue in key sales markets. Deliveries to the United States rose noticeably 
in value terms. Exports of motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts to China fell again 
considerably, however, as Chinese demand shifted strongly to electric vehicles, 
especially to domestic brands (see the supplementary information on recent develop-
). There was also a strong decline in sales of motor ments in German exports to China
vehicles to the euro area and the United Kingdom. Exports of classic capital goods such 
as machinery likewise fell sharply in price-adjusted terms. In addition, exports of 
machinery and equipment and intermediate goods from the electronics and electrical 
equipment sectors saw a marked contraction. The same was true of iron and steel 
products, which have a particularly energy-intensive manufacturing process. Exports of 
chemical products, which are likewise energy-intensive, rose sharply. However, this did 
not make up for even one-third of the considerable decline in the previous year. Produc-
tion of these had been severely affected by the sharp rise in energy prices since the 
start of the war in Ukraine. In the case of consumer goods, deliveries of pharmaceutical 
products were noticeably higher in the reporting year. For energy products, the volume 
of electricity and natural gas exports was down, quite considerably in the latter case,  
whereas significantly more refined petroleum products were exported. 3)

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 182The German export industry once again lost market share in its sales markets last 
year.  In 2024, German sales markets grew more strongly than exports. These kinds of 
losses in market share have been occurring for several years now, but have been partic-
ularly pronounced since the pandemic. Moreover, surveys of German exporters show 
that they have already been tending to rate their competitiveness more and more 
poorly for some time, even prior to the coronavirus crisis. Competitiveness has accord-
ingly fallen dramatically in recent years.


German balance of payments in 2024
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 183The losses of competitiveness illustrate the structural challenges facing the German 
economy, some of which have already been making themselves felt for some time.
Some of these structural problems became more apparent once the acute crises of 
2020 and 2022 had subsided. They were also compounded by unfavourable develop-
ments which had a particular impact on the German economy. These include the 
higher energy prices since Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine,  the challenges 
of the green transition, which recently posed problems for the German automotive 
industry especially,  and firms’ increasing complaints about bureaucratic burdens.  
Furthermore, mounting competitive pressure from Chinese firms and the weak growth 
of the Chinese economy are adversely affecting German exports.

German balance of payments in 2024
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 184Nominal imports from the euro area fell noticeably more sharply than imports from 
third countries.  Both regions suffered from the lower demand from Germany for key 
capital goods such as motor vehicles and machinery; furthermore, euro area countries 
did not benefit from the increased demand for pharmaceutical products. Imports from 
China stayed at almost the prior-year level and thus outperformed the cross-country 
average.  In net terms, German importers benefited from declining prices for energy 
and intermediate goods. Imports from  countries were down quite considerably in OPEC
terms of value, mainly because lower volumes of crude oil and refined petroleum 
products were imported. The value of imports from Norway also fell very strongly. One 
particular contributor to this was the drop in prices of natural gas, which accounted for 
almost three-fifths of total German imports from Norway. By contrast, a significantly 
larger volume of crude oil was sourced from Norway. Deliveries from Russia once again 
declined quite considerably in percentage terms.  They had fallen to very low levels in 
the previous year owing to  sanctions in connection with the war in Ukraine.EU
The product mix of imports developed in a similar way to that of exports.  Weak 
German industrial activity weighed on imports of capital goods and intermediate 
goods, whereas imports of consumer goods expanded substantially. However, there 
was a significant increase in purchases of chemical products and, above all, computer 
equipment manufactured abroad. For energy products, the imported volume of coal,
refined petroleum products and natural gas dropped steeply. However, this contrasted 
with a strong increase in the volume of crude oil deliveries. In addition, the volume of 
imported electricity rose considerably, which was mainly related to the decline in 
domestic electricity production.   10)

10 The foreign trade data do not allow any inferences to be made with regard to a change in the dependence on 
critical, often low-value inputs of Chinese manufacture. A survey conducted by the  Institute last year indicates ifo
that German firms were scaling back their purchases of important inputs manufactured by Chinese firms 
compared with a survey conducted in 2022, shortly before the war in Ukraine broke out. However, given that 
almost two-fifths of firms in the manufacturing sector continue to rely on these inputs, they are still fairly 
dependent. See Baur and Flach (2024). For further analyses of the German economy’s dependence on 
products from China, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2023a, 2023b). 
11 This was mainly due to lower import volumes of refined petroleum products and metals. In 2023, Russia’s 
share of total German imports had already fallen to just ¼%, down from 2¾% in 2021.
12 This was due to lower coal consumption, as non-fossil fuels, including those from abroad, were cheaper, 
meaning that less electricity was generated in German coal-fired power plants. See German Association of 
Energy and Water Industries (2024).
13 Electricity consumption in Germany increased slightly; electricity exports cumulatively fell by almost as much 
over the year.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 1851.3 Invisible current transactions
In 2024, the deficit in the cross-border services account increased considerably on 
the year to €74 billion.  The international exchange of services with Germany has 
become enormously important over the past few years. In 2024, services to the tune of 
almost €1 trillion were purchased from abroad or sold to other countries by Germany. 
Compared with the goods trade revenue of around €2½ trillion, this is not an insignifi-
cant economic activity. In contrast to international goods trade, however, Germany 
routinely imports more services than it exports.  Expenditure rose at a faster pace 
than revenue last year. The deficit thus increased by a little more than €10 billion on the 
year, resulting in the highest deficit in the Federal Republic of Germany’s existence. 
Cross-border travel is the main reason for the very negative services account 
balance.  At €111 billion, residents’ foreign travel expenditure was three times as high 
as income from foreign travellers in Germany (€37 billion). In 2024, the deficit of the 
travel account alone, a sub-account of services, was equal to the deficit in the services 
account as a whole. While revenue in this category, which Germany generates predomi-
nantly from travel for city trips, trade fairs, events and business trips, so far has not 
even reached the level of 2019 (prior to the 19 pandemic), expenditure here has COVID -
substantially exceeded that level since 2022. Private foreign travel by persons living in 
Germany was the dominant factor here. In this area, there has been no sign of 
consumer restraint thus far. In regional terms, the beneficiaries of this were most other
 countries, in particular, as well as Turkey. Expenditure on long-distance travel, EU
meanwhile, just reached its pre-pandemic level.  14) 
14 The pandemic years of 2020 and 2021, when a small surplus was generated in services trade, were one excep-
tion. This was primarily due to the lack of foreign travel expenditure by residents, which is normally responsi-
ble for the large deficit. 

German balance of payments in 2024
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 186The lion’s share of the services account’s total assets stems from the international 
exchange of commercial services.  Although services may appear less tradeable 
internationally than physical goods, sales of the former have quadrupled over the past 
20 years.  In addition to increasing international interconnectedness, ongoing digitali-
sation has significantly expanded trading opportunities. However, commercial services 
are also subject to cyclical fluctuations; here, too, the subdued economic situation in 
Germany was reflected. Revenue from services exports rose by just over 3% on the year 
in 2024, which was significantly weaker than the average of the past two decades. At 
just over 6%, expenditure rose more sharply, although it, too, fell short of the long-
term average. In the reporting year, the previously small deficit for all commerce-heavy 
services taken together rose by €11 billion to just under €21 billion. This was partly due 
to other business services, including research and development, professional and 
management consultancy services, commissions, and technical and other services. In 
addition, the reduction of a one-off effect from the pandemic again led to a smaller 
surplus in the item “charges for the use of intellectual property”. The effect is related to 
the development of vaccines, generating exceptionally high revenue in 2021 and 2022, 
in particular.  
Together with trade in goods, it was the primary income balance that contributed to 
Germany’s high current account surplus.  The surplus for 2024 came to €149 billion, 
representing an increase of approximately €12 billion compared with 2023. As a result, 
net primary income alone accounted for around 3½% of GDP .
The high primary income surplus is mainly the result of net investment income.
 Payments by residents to foreign investors grew at a similar rate on the year as income 
from domestic investors abroad. This was mainly on account of interest rates being 
hiked once more – albeit to a far lesser extent than in the previous two years. However, 
as German residents have far greater exposures abroad than foreign investors do in 
Germany, the amount domestic investors and lenders redeemed from cross-border 
investment income was far higher than their expenditure.  15) 
 16) 
 17) 
15 These include transport, manufacturing, maintenance and construction services, charges arising from the 
use of intellectual property,  telecommunications and information services and other business services.IT,
16 Sales in global trade in goods slightly more than doubled over the same period.
17 With regard to the services account, there are other sub-items, in particular financial and insurance services, 
where net income rose somewhat.

German balance of payments in 2024
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 187As in the previous year, the deficit in the cross-border secondary income account 
fell in 2024.  Expenditure exceeded revenue by €64 billion in the reporting year. 
There were increases in sales, primarily in connection with non-government cross-bor-
der secondary income. The volume of remittances of foreign nationals living in 
Germany rose, although they play a relatively minor role in terms of cross-border 
payment flows. By contrast, government cross-border expenditure and corresponding 
revenue both declined, with government expenditure falling on balance. Here, too, the 
reason lies in Germany’s persistently subdued economic output, which, to a significant 
extent, acts as a measure of the expenditure on Germany’s contributions to the  EU
budget, which were correspondingly lower in 2024.
 18) 
18 This sub-account captures unilateral international money flows. These include government expenditure such 
as contributions to international cooperation and contributions to international organisations, but also govern-
ment revenue such as taxes on the domestic investment income of foreign investors. In trade and industry, 
high cross-border payments of insurance premiums and insurance benefits play a major role, both on the 
revenue and the expenditure side.

German balance of payments in 2024
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 1892 Capital account
The German capital account captures cross-border transactions of non-produced 
non-financial assets and capital transfers and closed 2024 with a deficit of €20½ 
billion.  In the previous year, the deficit had amounted to €27 billion. In terms of transac-
tion volume, the capital account is generally significantly smaller than the current 
account or financial account, but has gained in significance in recent years. This is 
because the price of emission allowances under the European Union Emissions Trading 
System  rose significantly at the end of 2021, after important reforms had ( ) EU ETS
entered into force.  Since 2022, trade in emissions allowances has been by far the 
most important item in the category of non-produced non-financial assets and is also 
shaping developments throughout the capital account as a whole.
From a German perspective, cross-border transactions of non-produced non-finan-
cial assets closed 2024 with a deficit of €16 billion, which was thus somewhat lower 
than in 2023 (€19½ billion).  The shortfall was almost exclusively attributable to the 
surplus in expenditure on emissions allowances trading (€15½ billion). Cross-border 
trade in intellectual property also dominated sales in 2024, which was reflected in a 
deficit of €½ billion.
In terms of capital transfers, Germany likewise recorded higher expenditure than 
revenue on balance in 2024 (€4½ billion).  A year earlier, this deficit had amounted to 
€7½ billion. Alongside a large number of other types of transfer, insurance benefits for 
major losses contributed €1 billion to the deficit in this category. 19)

Does the use of Bitcoin as legal tender affect cross-
border capital flows? Empirical evidence using El 
Salvador as an example
On 7 September 2021, El Salvador became the first country in the world to officially 
recognise Bitcoin as legal tender, as part of a bid to improve its population’s access 
to financial services.  However, the economic and financial consequences of this 
unconventional policy decision were controversial from the outset. The International 
Monetary Fund  for example, warned El Salvador’s policymakers that making a ( ),IMF
crypto-asset legal tender would pose significant risks to financial and market integrity, 
financial stability and consumer protection.  In late January 2025, the parliament of El 
Salvador lifted the mandate requiring merchants to accept Bitcoin as a means of 
payment, reversing the privileged status of Bitcoin as legal tender that had been intro-
duced three years earlier.  This was one of the ‘s conditions for a $1.4 billion IMF US
support package.
This supplementary information examines whether the introduction of Bitcoin as 
legal tender in El Salvador in September 2021 affected the country’s cross-border 
capital flows.  The first part of the analysis draws on aggregate  balance of IMF
payments data. The database distinguishes between four types of asset categories in 
the area of capital flows, which is the subject of this analysis: foreign direct investment, 
debt securities, equities and other investment. For the empirical analysis, all capital 
flows are measured in relation to the gross domestic product  of the country in ( ) GDP

German balance of payments in 2024
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 191The analysis is limited to Central America and compares the development of El 
Salvador’s capital flows with other countries in the region.  Specifically, the countries 
examined are Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. Not only do these 
countries share a variety of common features, such as language, size and level of 
economic and financial development, but they have also constituted the Central Ameri-
can Common Market (Mercado Común Centroamericano,  for more than half a MCCA )
century. 
The analysis uses a difference-in-differences estimator to assess the impact of 
Bitcoin as a means of payment on capital flows.  In formal terms, the regression 
equation is as follows: 
where capital flows_{it} denotes the capital flow of country i at time t; \alpha_i repre- 
sents country-specific fixed effects that account for time-invariant country factors; 
\beta_t represents time-specific fixed effects that capture global developments, and Z_
{it} represents a vector of other country-specific and time-specific control variables. The 
main focus is on the interaction term between the binary variables El\,Salvador_i and 
Bitcoin_t. This interaction indicates how capital flows from El Salvador evolved after the 
introduction of Bitcoin as legal tender compared with the period prior to its adoption.
Panel regressions, which additionally control for country-specific uncertainty, 
clearly show that Bitcoin had a negative effect on El Salvador’s cross-border capital 
flows.  Chart 6.10 shows the regression results separately for El Salvador’s capital 
exports and capital imports following the policy measure compared with the other four 
countries in the control group. The overview distinguishes between a short-term (-/+ 
four quarters relative to Q3/2021) and a long-term (-/+ eight quarters relative to Q3
/2021) period. The equation is estimated using the ordinary least squares  ( )OLS
method. The dependent variables are expressed as a percentage of  All estimated GDP .
parameters are negative. Only in the short term do capital imports not respond signifi-
cantly to the introduction of Bitcoin as legal tender. All other coefficients are statistically 
highly significant. Capital exports declined by between 4.6% and 5.4% of  on GDP
average (capital imports by between 0.5% and 4.7%).

German balance of payments in 2024
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 192Bilateral monthly data from the Bundesbank’s statistics on international financial 
and capital transactions ( ) SIFCT  suggest that El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin had a 
negative impact on cross-border capital flows with Germany.  Chart 6.11 shows the 
regression results for the change in Germany’s bilateral outflows and inflows vis-à-vis El 
Salvador relative to the other four countries after the policy was introduced. Here, too, 
a distinction is made between a short-term (-/+ six months relative to September 2021) 
and a long-term (-/+ 12 months relative to September 2021) period. The dependent 
variables are expressed in levels and estimated using the Pseudo-Poisson Maximum 
Likelihood method. The estimated parameters are all negative and, for the most part, 
highly statistically significant, with the exception of long-term outflows. On average, 
outflows decreased by between 26% and 62% (inflows by between 47% and 63%). Thus, 
data from both the  and the Bundesbank suggest that the adoption of Bitcoin had a IMF
substantial negative impact on El Salvador’s cross-border capital flows. Further robust-
ness checks using different time horizons or sub-categories of asset classes confirm the 
previous results. 


German balance of payments in 2024
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 193The introduction of a privately issued, volatile crypto-asset as legal tender appears 
to have had a negative impact on El Salvador’s cross-border capital flows.  El Salvador’
s officially reported cross-border capital flows declined after the policy was introduced. 
The adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender had a negative impact on various asset 
categories, including foreign direct investments, debt securities and equities. One possi-
ble reason for this is heightened uncertainty. Alternatively, financial transfers that were 
previously officially recorded might have been replaced by unrecorded activities.

3.1 Underlying trends in capital flows
Germany’s net capital exports amounted to €239½ billion in 2024, which, like the 
current account balance, was thus up on the previous year’s level (€195½ billion). 
The remaining difference between the balances on the current account and the capital 
account on the one hand and the balance on the financial account on the other hand is 
attributable to statistical errors and omissions (€13 billion).


German balance of payments in 2024
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 195Against the backdrop of high political and economic uncertainty, enterprises contin-
ued to make relatively little direct investment internationally.  According to prelimi-
nary  data, global foreign direct investment  flows again remained UNCTAD ()FDI
subdued in 2024.  Despite an increase of as much as 11% on the year,  remained FDI
below the volumes usually recorded. The increase in global  was mainly concen-FDI
trated in a number of European countries where specialised holding companies are 
located. These serve as a financial hub for cross-border capital flows and largely pass 
on to other groups any funds provided.  According to  adjusting  flows in UNCTAD , FDI
these countries for potential double-counting shows that global  flows were again FDI
8% lower than in the previous year. Direct investment flows to and from Germany were 
lower in 2024 than in 2023 as well.
In 2024, German portfolio investment with non-residents was mainly influenced by 
a looser, yet still restrictive, monetary policy on both sides of the Atlantic in the 
second half of the year.  German investors showed a strong interest in foreign money 
market funds, which offered attractive amounts of interest income while being compar-
atively low in risk. However, higher-risk securities were also acquired. Interest in mutual 
fund shares (excluding money market funds) was particularly prominent, as they allow 
investors to take on a variety of risky securities without directly owning them. 
Conversely, foreign investors increasingly sought German public sector debt securities, 
with the primary intention of replenishing their holdings of Federal securities. In the 
years following the start of the asset purchase programmes in autumn 2014, foreign 
investors had sold Federal debt securities to the Eurosystem on balance. The 
turnaround that began in 2022 and the increased purchases by foreign investors since 
2023 are now also reflected in the renewed rise in international free float.
Other investment is strongly influenced by banking system transactions and ended 
2024 with net capital exports.  Commercial banks’ net claims rose significantly on the 
year, while the Bundesbank’s net position remained virtually unchanged. However, the 
Bundesbank’s  claims on the  changes in which are also recorded under TARGET ECB,
other investment, declined. 20)

Germany’s capital links with the United States
Germany has a positive net external position vis-à-vis the United States, especially 
with regard to equities and direct investment.  At most, a loose relationship can be 
identified between bilateral current account balances and developments in the bilateral 
external asset position . This is because the regional structure of international transac-
tions and capital flows is determined by a large number of heterogeneous players with 
different motives.  In the past two years, Germany even recorded net capital imports 
vis-à-vis the United States while maintaining a positive current account balance (see 
Chart 6.13). This was due to investors from the United States purchasing German 
bonds on a large scale. A key factor in this context was that the European asset 
purchase programmes  and  were gradually being phased out and the Bundes- APP PEPP
bank was acquiring fewer and fewer of these securities.  investors replenished their US
portfolios of Bunds, which had shrunk in previous years.  1) 
 2) 
1 Germany’s bilateral international investment position vis-à-vis the United States has not risen any further since 
2022. This was primarily due to developments in the bond market. Since then, German investors have not 
purchased any more  bonds on balance, while  investors have increasingly acquired German bonds. US US
Amongst other things, this was due to changes in monetary conditions, which had the effect of making 
German and other European securities relatively attractive again. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2024f). 
2 For example, if a German car manufacturer exports a vehicle to the United States, this initially creates an exter-
nal claim on the  importer, which is typically settled by bank transfer. Under certain circumstances, the German US
vendor may not invest this asset in the United States, but instead purchase Italian government bonds. In this 
example, the original owner of these bonds acquires  dollars. At the end of these exchanges, Germany’s US
current account surplus with the United States would be elevated. Germany’s net external assets would have 
risen by the same amount, but vis-à-vis Italy rather than the United States. Italy’s net external assets would 
remain unchanged, but with higher claims on the United States and higher liabilities to Germany. The United 
States would ultimately record a higher current account deficit with Germany and higher external liabilities to 
Italy.

German balance of payments in 2024
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 198Measured in terms of capital links, the United States, alongside the United Kingdom, 
is Germany’s most important partner country outside the euro area.  At the end of 
the third quarter of 2024,  assets accounted for 12.3% (€1,461 billion of €11,863 US
billion) of Germany’s international investment position (excluding financial derivatives). 
Including securities held indirectly via foreign investment companies, the share was an 
estimated 14.2%.  By comparison, investors from the United States held 12.1% of 
German external liabilities (€1,040 billion of €8,590 billion).

3 In addition, there are  securities held indirectly by German investors via investment funds. Investment funds US
in Luxembourg and Ireland in particular play a prominent role in this regard. At the end of the third quarter of 
2024, 95% (€1,248 billion) of the investment fund shares held abroad by German investors had been issued by 
companies based in Luxembourg or Ireland. The investment focus of about 18% of these investment fund 
companies is in the United States (survey by Morningstar dated 22 January 2025). This suggests that, in 
addition, German investors indirectly held  securities worth around €225 billion in their portfolios. US

corresponded to a little under one-sixth (15.8%) of the total equity capital included in

The most important industries attracting German direct investment in the United

higher if the equity capital held indirectly via holding companies in third countries is also included. This infor-
mation can be found in the Bundesbank’s foreign direct investment statistics up to the end of 2022. At that 
time, the difference was €50 billion.

According to the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry, German enterprises’ 
plans for investing abroad in 2024 were rather cautious.  Alongside weak demand 
both at home and from abroad, the decreasing non-price competitiveness of Germany 
as a business location also came under growing scrutiny.  Compounding this were 
geopolitical risks and increasing protectionist tendencies, which enterprises have to 
take into account when making cross-border investments. The significant overall 
increase in uncertainty for the global economy thus posed particular challenges for 
German enterprises with regard to their cross-border investment decisions last year. In 
addition, in 2024, the cost savings motive also played a greater role again in direct 
investment planning, relative to previous years. However, the development and expan-
sion of sales and customer services continued to be particularly strong drivers of 
German industrial enterprises’ foreign investment. Many enterprises assessed the 
economic outlook in business locations abroad as more favourable than the outlook in 
Germany.
In this difficult economic environment, cross-border FDI flows to and from Germany 
resulted in net capital exports of €30½ billion in 2024, following €24 billion the previ-
ous year.  However, the increase was once again driven by lower gross flows on both 
sides of the balance sheet. Both German outward  and inward  were down on FDI FDI
their levels of the year before. 22)

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 202Overall, enterprises domiciled in Germany invested around €73½ billion in FDI last 
year, which was €22 billion less than in the previous year.  German investors upped 
their equity capital in foreign enterprises by €60½ billion. This was mainly achieved by 
reinvesting earnings, whilst investment via equity capital in the narrower sense (i.e. 
additional or new equity investments) contributed around one-fifth to this amount. A 
number of services-oriented sectors were the main players here. German enterprises 
furthermore provided affiliated enterprises abroad with funds totalling €13½ billion net 
via intra-group lending. Measured in terms of volume, cross-border corporate 
takeovers in 2024 by firms domiciled in Germany lagged behind the previous year, 
while the number of transactions increased.
 25) 
25 Realised takeovers of firms domiciled abroad and previously under foreign ownership – and a German stake 
of at least 10% after the transaction – accounted for around €11½ billion in 2024; this was significantly less 
than in 2023, when the value of the takeovers was reported at around €24 billion (data based on  Workspace, LSEG
data extracted as at 26 February 2025). The time at which mergers and acquisitions are captured in the 
balance of payments can, however, differ from that recorded by  Workspace, meaning that the reported LSEG
figures are not directly comparable.

German balance of payments in 2024
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 203The United States received the largest shares of funds, accounting for more than 
one-quarter of all German FDI in 2024.  The business outlook was deemed predomi-
nantly positive by the German firms operating there.  The United States was thus 
once again particularly crucial to the business of internationally active enterprises 
domiciled in Germany (see the supplementary information on German capital links with 
 and the the United States German current account surplus vis-à-vis the United States
). At the same time, German enterprises provided affiliated enterprises in the United 
States with additional funds in this way. They mainly invested funds via equity capital, 
particularly in the narrower sense. On balance, they also granted large volumes of 
financial credit to affiliated enterprises in the United States. 
More than one-third of German FDI benefited EU partner countries last year, with 
the majority going to other euro area countries.  German  relationships in 2024 FDI
were largely shaped by higher outflows of funds to the Netherlands and Luxembourg 
as well as return flows from Belgium and Ireland, with some of these countries playing 
a key role as holding locations. In addition, within Europe, German enterprises 
provided affiliated enterprises in Switzerland and Sweden with a larger volume of direct 
investment funds. 
Outside Europe, larger amounts were once again reinvested in affiliated companies 
in China via profits generated there.  This trend, which has been observed for some 
time now, masks the fact that German parent companies have been reducing their 
equity capital in the narrower sense in China over the past few years; the same is true 
of 2024.  The supplementary information below ( The role of geopolitical aspects for

The role of geopolitical aspects in German foreign 
direct investments in partner countries
This analysis presents a time-varying country-specific “geopolitical index” and inves-
tigates whether there is a correlation between this index and the foreign direct 
investments of German companies in partner countries.  Since Russia began its war of 
aggression against Ukraine, there has been more intense discussion among politicians, 
academics and international organisations about the impact of geopolitical factors on 
international economic relations. The starting point of this analysis is the empirical 
observation that cross-border trade between countries belonging to the same geopoliti-
cal bloc has recently increased.  This trend has also been observed in foreign direct 
investment.
The ECB has developed a “geopolitical index” that categorises countries into a 
Western, an Eastern and a neutral bloc.  The index ranges from zero to one, with a 
value of zero meaning that a country is very close to the United States geopolitically, 
while a value of one represents strong alignment with China (and Russia). Countries 
with a value of 0.5 are classified as neutral. Using these values, the  divides ECB
countries into three blocs: countries with values under 0.25 are classified as part of the 
Western bloc, those between 0.25 and 0.75 are classified as neutral, and those exceed-
ing 0.75 as part of the Eastern bloc. 1)

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 205The ECB’s “geopolitical index” incorporates data on sanctions, arms imports, trade 
routes (“New Silk Road”) and the results of a single United Nations vote.  Specifically, 
it is based on the following data sets: information from the Global Sanctions Database 
on sanctions imposed by the United States, Russia and China against other countries;  
arms imports from the United States, Russia and China from the  database;  SIPRI
whether and how long a country has been a partner in the expansion of China’s “New 
Silk Road” (“Belt and Road Initiative ”) and the results of the vote at the eleventh ()BRI
emergency special session of the United Nations on 2 March 2022 concerning the 
Russian attack on Ukraine. Each of the four (sub-)indices is normalised so that the 
values are between zero and one, with a neutral value of 0.5. The arithmetic mean of all 
four values is then taken to obtain an aggregate index for each country.
This analysis uses time-varying annual data to examine how the “geopolitical index” 
of German partner countries and their economic and political relations with the 
United States, China and Russia have changed over time.  For this reason, the study 
considers both the results of the  vote in March 2022 and the entirety of voting UN
patterns in United Nations sessions from 1999 to 2022.
While partner countries with which Germany is connected through foreign direct 
investment tend to align politically with the United States, they have increasingly 
also deepened their relations with China in recent years.  Chart 6.16 illustrates the

ment to the United States (value = 0) and China/Russia (value = 1) over time, both

German balance of payments in 2024
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 206The rise in the “geopolitical index” and the increased proximity between Germany’s 
partner countries and China (and Russia) are primarily driven by the “New Silk Road” 
subindex.  Chart 6.17 shows the weighted average development of the four sub-in- GDP -
dices. In 1999, the subindices predominantly reflected closer proximity to the United 
States, with the exception of  voting patterns, which appeared more neutral. UN
However, the upward trend of the lines generally suggests a certain increase in proxim-
ity to China (and Russia). In particular, participation in the “New Silk Road” has had a 
significant impact on the trajectory of the aggregate index since 2013.  However, the 
subindices for sanctions and arms deliveries also show an upward trend. Only the 
United Nations voting results have remained relatively stable over time, with some 
fluctuations.
 12) 
12 The variable is binary, indicating that a country either takes part in the “New Silk Road” (assigned a value of 
one) or does not (assigned a value of zero). As countries have participated in the project at different times, the 
variable fluctuates both across countries and over time. Italy withdrew from the project in 2023. However, this 
is not relevant for the present analysis, as data on foreign direct investment are only available through 2022.

German balance of payments in 2024
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 207The results of a panel estimation procedure suggest that there is a correlation 
between the “geopolitical index” and specific aspects of German foreign direct 
investment (total stock, equity capital, intra-group loans, turnover and employ-
ment).  The study is based on the Deutsche Bundesbank’s Microdatabase Direct Invest-
ment  which contains annual data for a total of 169 countries from 2002 to 2022. ( ), MiDi
 The regressions are estimated using Pseudo-Poisson Maximum Likelihood  ( ) PPML
and are structured as follows:
 13) 
13 In order to balance the panel, the dependent variables are assigned a value of zero when no observation is 
available. For real economic growth, country size and development level, the initial value is also set to zero and 
then carried forward on an annual basis until a new value becomes available. This new value is then carried 
forward. If the initial value of the index is unavailable, it is set to 0.5. Subsequently, the same method is 
applied as for the other explanatory variables.

capital, intra-group loans, turnover and employment) of country i in year t;\alpha_i and 
\beta_t capture country-specific and time-specific fixed effects ; growth {it} controls _

mised nominal  in  dollars), and development {it} for the level of development of GDP US
the respective economies (logarithmised nominal  per capita in  dollars). The key GDP US
explanatory variable is index_{it}, which corresponds to the adjusted “geopolitical 
index” introduced above. The parameter \gamma thus indicates how an economic 
indicator changes in response to changes in the index. Standard errors are calculated 
using country-level clustering.
The estimation results suggest that German companies increase their foreign direct 
investment in partner countries through intra-group loans when the “geopolitical 
index” rises.  This could be due to the fact that many of these countries joined China's 
“New Silk Road” initiative starting in 2013.  Chart 6.18 illustrates the main findings of 
the regression analysis. Only the estimated coefficient for intra-group loans is signifi-
cantly positive: if the index increases by 0.1 point, the average value of intra-group 
loans rises by approximately 16%.  German companies may be seeking to profit 
economically from the “New Silk Road” by expanding their foreign investment. In 
contrast, the estimated parameters for the total stock of foreign direct investment, 
equity capital, turnover and employment are insignificant, meaning that the “geopoliti-
cal index” does not have an impact on these variables. 14) 
 15) 
 16) 
 17) 
14 Both fixed effects capture economically significant aspects. The time-specific fixed effects control for the 
general upward trend in foreign direct investment across all countries over time, while the country-specific 
fixed effects account for whether a country is generally more economically aligned with the United States or 
with China/Russia. The estimations thus account for level effects, as illustrated in Chart 6.17.
15 Panel data which track a fixed set of countries over time often show correlations within each country across 
time. Clustering the standard errors by country takes these temporal dependencies into account and provides 
more robust estimates.
16 Separate estimations using only the “New Silk Road” subindex, however, do not yield statistically significant 
results. One possible reason for this is the low volatility of this binary index, which also only becomes relevant 
from 2013 onward.
17 Robustness checks for a subset of newly founded (or acquired) affiliates show that the “geopolitical index” 
has no significant impact on either total foreign direct investment or equity capital. However, intra-group 
loans remain significantly positive.

German balance of payments in 2024
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 209The empirical results should be interpreted with a degree of caution.  The dataset 
analysed only goes up to 2022, meaning later developments were not taken into 
account. For example, Italy withdrew from the “New Silk Road” project in 2023.


German balance of payments in 2024
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 210In 2024, there was a net inflow of €43½ billion of FDI funds to Germany, primarily via 
equity capital in the narrower sense and, to a lesser extent, via intra-group lending.  
Overall, this was markedly less than in the previous year, when foreign investors’ new 
exposure in Germany amounted to €71½ billion. However, a trend seen in previous 
years continued as of 2023, signalling a decline in foreign investment in Germany via

business location could be reinforced.  data themselves do not yet allow any clear FDI
conclusions to be drawn with regard to the reasons for the developments over the past 
few years – both cyclical and structural factors are likely to have played a role.  A 
study conducted by the Bundesbank shows that the competitiveness of Germany as a 
business location has been deteriorating for several years now. In particular, non-price 
competitiveness has declined, indicating structural problems.
In 2024, around 70% of German FDI came from enterprises based in euro area 
partner countries.  The main sources of this were cross-border inflows of funds from 
Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Ireland. In addition, there were large  inflows to FDI
Germany from Switzerland and Norway. Outside Europe, affiliated companies from the 
United States were particularly important investors for German firms. On balance, just 
under one-third of total  came from the United States, and this was largely invested FDI
in equity capital in the narrower sense. The inflows of  to Germany were partly FDI
offset by larger return flows to some countries, such as the United Kingdom and 
Cyprus. This was due to the fact that intra-group lending was dominated by repay-
ments of previously granted loans.

Germany’s cross-border portfolio investment resulted in net capital exports of €31½ 
billion in 2024.  In the previous year, when gross sales were significantly lower, 
Germany had recorded net outflows of €2 billion in portfolio investment. Transaction

end of the year. The individual national central banks thus left the market as a buyer 
group. As a result, government debt securities now need to be absorbed again by the 
private sector, which has pushed up free float, i.e. the stock of freely tradeable securi-
ties. In addition, some euro area countries issued significantly more bonds than in the 
previous year, which increased the supply of these securities.


German balance of payments in 2024
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 212The positive balance in portfolio investment was attributable to domestic investors’ 
high levels of investment abroad.  At €220 billion, they acquired significantly more 
foreign securities in 2024 than in the previous year (€154½ billion). This was particularly 
true of money market funds and other foreign mutual fund shares (together totalling 
€112 billion). One reason for the high demand for interest-bearing instruments was the 
comparatively high foreign interest rates. The euro had also come under pressure due 
to the strong interest rate differential with the  dollar, making investment in the US
United States even more attractive. Equity-related mutual fund shares benefited from 
the comparatively favourable economic outlook in the United States and some 
European partner countries. This is consistent with the fact that  technology shares US
listed in the Nasdaq appreciated considerably over the course of the year, outperform-
ing most of the bullish global equity indices.
At €103 billion, demand for foreign debt securities declined in 2024, but was still 
relatively high.  Just under two-thirds of purchases consisted of euro-denominated 
bonds on balance, which was markedly lower than in 2023 but exceeded the figures for 
all other years since the  was launched. On an average of the years 2015 to 2022, APP
German investors had invested only €18 billion net in such securities – indeed, in some 
years, they had even sold securities. The exceptionally high demand in 2023 is likely to 
have been due to German investors having already increased their portfolios of euro 
bonds substantially when the  was discontinued. Investors therefore believed they APP
had some catching up to do. Furthermore, German investors purchased foreign 
currency bonds (€24½ billion) and money market paper (€12 billion) in 2024. Demand 
was up slightly on the year in both segments. Looking back, foreign currency bonds 
benefited from positive valuation effects owing to the weakness of the euro vis-à-vis 
major trading partners. In nominal effective terms, the euro depreciated by 1½% in 
2024.   31) 
31 The nominal effective exchange rate comprises the weighted exchange rates of the 18 trading partners most 
important to the euro area economy.

German balance of payments in 2024
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 213Conversely, non-residents purchased German securities worth €188½ billion net, the 
highest value since the global financial crisis.  The last time international investors had 
shown even greater interest in German paper was in 2007. Last year, they purchased 
long-term debt securities worth €210½ billion, with public bonds making up the lion’s 
share. The strong demand for German government securities was fostered by the 
Eurosystem phasing out its reinvestments, which made this type of securities more 
readily available in the market. This was reflected in a diminishing scarcity premium. In 
recent years, Federal bonds (Bunds) had particularly high scarcity premia due to their 
popularity as collateral and as a means of holding liquidity.  However, as the risk 
appetite of many investors also increased, foreign demand for private bonds issued in 
Germany was also significantly higher.
As in the previous year, foreign investors disposed of German shares (€5½ billion, 
2023: €13 billion).  On balance, international investors were not interested in shares of 
companies domiciled in Germany, despite high price gains on the German stock 
exchange. This may have been due to economic agents assessing the economic outlook 
in Germany as weak in both economic and structural terms. In this setting, investors 
clearly preferred – in net terms – to take advantage of price gains in the German equity 
market rather than to continue investing in German enterprises. Contrary to the trend, 
investors from the United States acquired German shares (€5½ billion), while the 
highest sales were recorded in the United Kingdom (€4 billion), Luxembourg (€3½ 
billion) and the Netherlands (€3½ billion). However, as these three countries are impor-
tant international financial centres, these transactions are likely to have been driven 
mainly by market participants from third countries, including domestic investors.
Financial derivatives (which are aggregated into a single item in the balance of 
payments) recorded higher net capital exports than in the previous year.  They 
amounted to €42 billion, following €36 billion in 2023. Options trades were the main 
factor contributing to the outflow of funds.  Forward and futures contracts relating to 
gas increased by around one-quarter in 2024 compared with the previous year. 
However, this meant that they remained well below the balance of 2022, which had 
risen sharply as a result of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. 32) 
 33) 
32 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2025b).
33 This was mainly due to compensatory intra-group transactions in the form of over-the-counter options for 
transactions in structured short and long-term debt securities from German issuers. See Deutsche Bundes-
bank (2021).

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 2143.4 Other investment
Other investment recorded net capital exports of €137 billion in 2024, almost the 
same as in the previous year.  However, developments on the assets and liabilities 
sides differed between the two years. Liabilities to non-residents fell sharply in 2023, 
while claims on non-residents rose significantly in the reporting year 2024. Such 
changes are typical in other investment. In particular, the holdings of currency and 
deposits in the banking system are subject to sharp fluctuations and are often accompa-
nied by individual institutions expanding or reducing their balance sheets. Netted items 
are therefore generally more meaningful. That said, it is important to keep an eye on 
assets and liabilities; they can provide important information on the underlying 
payment flows and on possible changes in the financial infrastructure. Examples of this 
include the sharp increase in gross transactions following the United Kingdom’s 
withdrawal from the  and the settlement of the Eurosystem’s asset purchases viaEU
TARGET .

34 The other investment account comprises loans and trade credits (where these do not constitute direct invest-
ment) as well as bank deposits and other investment.
35 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2022, 2017).

German balance of payments in 2024
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 215The net capital exports of monetary financial institutions (excluding the Bundes-
bank) to non-residents amounted to €107½ billion in 2024.  Claims on foreign institu-
tions arising from currency and deposits rose particularly significantly. Claims on group-
affiliated banks had a particular bearing here: such arrangements are often based on 
business management decisions relating to liquidity management. Commercial banks’ 
claims on non-residents also increased sharply as a result of financial loans being 
granted to enterprises and households. Conversely, foreign players increased their 
deposits with German institutions, consisting of deposits from banks abroad as well as 
enterprises and households domiciled abroad.
Bundesbank accounts recorded net capital exports of €3 billion last year.  The 
Bundesbank’s gross claims and gross liabilities vis-à-vis non-residents each declined to 
a similar extent in 2024.  claims on the  fell by €47 billion, which was less TARGET ECB
than in 2023 (€175½ billion). This is because the winding-down of monetary policy 
securities portfolios in the context of tighter monetary policy has not reduced German
 claims since mid-2023 as significantly as they had previously risen when the TARGET
balance sheet was being built up under the asset purchase programmes.  One 
reason for this appears to be a change in investor behaviour in the market for euro-de-
nominated government bonds. In other euro area countries, for example, domestic 
investors in particular recently purchased the newly issued national government bonds. 
Unlike with purchases by investors from third countries, which are often settled via 
Germany, no central bank liquidity flowed out of Germany in this case. Another reason 
for this was the supply effect for Bunds described above. Once the Eurosystem had 
phased out its monetary policy asset purchases, private investors were able to restock 
their supply of Bunds more easily, as outlined above. This resulted in an exceptionally 
strong demand from abroad for German Federal securities, for example. Where 
investors from other euro area countries acquired these securities, central bank liquid-
ity flowed to Germany, which, when viewed in isolation, increased Germany’s  TARGET
balance. 36)

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – March 2025 2163.5 Reserve assets
The Bundesbank’s reserve assets decreased by €1½ billion in 2024 on account of 
transactions.  On balance, this was mainly due to lower claims on other reserve assets 
and a decline in the reserve position in the IMF.
The international reserve holdings are also influenced by balance sheet adjustments 
which, in compliance with internationally agreed accounting standards, are not 
recognised in the balance of payments.  The end-of-year revaluation of the reserve 
assets resulted in an increase of just under €73 billion in 2024. This was due chiefly to 
an increase in gold prices compared to the previous year. On the reporting date of 31 
December 2024, the value of Germany’s reserve assets stood at €363½ billion.
The balance of payments data on which this article is based were published on 14 March

Discrepancies may arise from rounding.  * The banking system's liquidity position is
defined as the current account holdings in euro of euro area credit institutions with the
Eurosystem. Amounts are derived from the consolidated financial statement of the
Eurosystem and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  1 Figures are daily averages
for the reserve maintenance period ending in the month indicated. Following the
changeover in the frequency of Governing Council monetary policy meetings to a
six-week cycle, a reserve maintenance period no longer ends in every month. No figuresare available in such cases.  2 Source: ECB.  3 Includes liquidity provided under the

allocated to the ECB on a monthly basis. The counterpart of this adjustment is shown
under “Other factors”. The remaining 92% of the value of the euro banknotes in
circulation is allocated, likewise on a monthly basis, to the NCBs, with each NCB
showing in its balance sheet the share of the euro banknotes issued corresponding to
its paid-up share in the ECB's capital. The difference between the value of the euro
banknotes allocated to an NCB and the value of the euro banknotes which that NCB
has put into circulation is likewise shown under “Other factors”. From 2003 eurobanknotes only.  6 Remaining items in the consolidated financial statement of the Euro-

* The consolidated financial statement of the Eurosystem comprises the financial
statement of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the financial statements of the
national central banks of the euro area Member States (NCBs). The balance sheet items
for foreign currency, securities, gold and financial instruments are valued at market
rates at the end of the quarrter.  1 In accordance with the accounting procedure chosenby the Eurosystem for the issue of euro banknotes, a share of 8% of the total value of
the euro banknotes in circulation is allocated to the ECB on a monthy basis. The
counterpart of this adjustment is disclosed as an "Intra-Eurosystem liability related to
euro banknote issue". The remaining 92% of the value of the euro banknotes in
circulation is allocated, likewise on an monthly basis, to the NCBs, with each NCB

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).

ures based on the quarterly figures of the Federal Statistical Office, core budgets and
off-budget entities which are assigned to the general government sector.  2 The annual
figures do not tally with the sum of the quarterly figures, as the latter are all pro-
visional. The quarterly figures for some insurance sectors are estimated.  3 The develop-
ment of the types of expenditure recorded here is influenced in part by statisticalchangeovers.  4 Including discrepancies in clearing transactions between central, state
and local government.  5 On the revenue side, this contains proceeds booked as dis-
posals of equity interests and as loan repayments. On the expenditure side, this con-
tains the acquisition of equity interests and loans granted.  6 Excluding central govern-
ment liquidity assistance to the Federal Employment Agency.

* The effective exchange rate corresponds to the weighted external value of the curren-
cy concerned. The method of calculating the indicators of the German economy's price
competitiveness is consistent with the procedure to compute the effective exchange
rates of the euro. A decline in the figures implies an increase in competitiveness. The
weights are based on trade in manufactured goods and services. For more detailed in-
formation on methodology and weighting scale, see the website of the Deutsche
Bundesbank (https://www.bundesbank.de/content/796162).  1 The calculations are
based on the weighted averages of the changes in the bilateral exchange rates of the
euro vis-à-vis the currencies of the following 18 countries: Australia, Bulgaria, Canada,
China, Czechia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan, Norway, Poland, Romania,
Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United
States. Where current price and wage indices were not available, estimates were used.
2 Includes countries belonging to the extended EER group of trading partners (fixed
composition) and additionally the following 23 countries: Algeria, Argentina, Brazil,
Chile, Colombia, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, New Zea-
land, Peru, Philippines, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Taiwan,Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and United Arab Emirates. The ECB has suspended the
publication and calculation of the euro foreign exchange reference rate against Russian
rouble with effect from March 2, 2022 until further notice. For the calculation of
effective exchange rates, an indicative rate is used for the Russian Federation from that
date. It is calculated from the daily RUB/USD rates determined by the Bank of Russia in
conjunction with the respective ECB's euro foreign exchange reference rate to the US
dollar.  3 Annual and quarterly averages.  4 Euro area countries (from 2001 including
Greece, from 2007 including Slovenia, from 2008 including Cyprus and Malta, from
2009 including Slovakia, from 2011 including Estonia, from 2014 including Latvia, from
2015 including Lithuania, from 2023 including Croatia) as well as Canada, Denmark,
Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.
