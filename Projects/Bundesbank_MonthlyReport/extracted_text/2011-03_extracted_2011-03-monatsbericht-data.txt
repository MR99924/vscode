Underlying trends
The underlying trend recovery of the German
economy continued at the beginning of the
year. The upturn was strengthened by a
counter-movement to the weather-related
slowdown in overall activity in December of
last year. This is reflected in a marked rise in
construction output. According to initial data,
industrial output largely stagnated, however,
at least when compared with the level in
December, which has been revised upwards.
By contrast, there was a sharp, broadly based
increase in demand for industrial goods.
Export and output expectations in manu-
facturing also point to expansion. There was
continued growth in employment and a
further fall in unemployment. This is likely to
have contributed to the further improvement
in consumer sentiment.
The statistical data on real retail sales in
December 2010 have since been revised up-
wards and are now more consistent with
other indicators of consumption than before.
The retail trade figures for January indicate a
slight increase on the month in real terms.
Industry
Seasonally adjusted industrial output in Janu-
ary was only1/4% up on the month, although
it should be noted that the December figure
had been revised upwards by 1%. In nominal
terms, the sharp 51/4% rise in intermediate
goods compared with the weak result of the
previous month more or less offset the simi-Economic

6larly sharp decline in capital goods. This pri-
marily affected machinery and motor ve-
hicles, ie those goods for which production
had been stepped up in the final quarter of
2010 owing to the discontinuation of the
declining-balance depreciation facility at the
end of the year. By contrast, output of con-
sumer goods rose by 23/4%.
There was a sharp broadly based rise in
demand for industrial goods at the beginning
of the year, with a seasonally adjusted 3%
increase on the month. The increase in the
case of intermediate goods, at 41/2%, was
particularly marked, and orders of capital
goods also went up by 2%. The mechanical
engineering sector recorded slight losses;
this, however, was due to the significantly
smaller volume of large orders in January
compared with December and a decline in
that part of the electrical engineering sector
which is assigned to capital goods. Never-
theless, the automotive industry recorded
growth of 41/4% and the consumer goods
sector also achieved some growth. In regional
terms, domestic orders, which went up by
41/2% following a sharp decline in December,
were tending to increase much more sharply
than export orders (+11/2%). There was
marked growth in orders from euro-area
partner countries again following an extend-
ed period of sluggishness. By contrast,
additional orders from non-euro-area coun-
tries remained within comparatively narrow
bounds.
The value of domestic industrial sales in Janu-
ary went up by a seasonally adjusted 2% on
the month. Both manufacturers of intermedi-Economic conditions in Germany*

7ate goods and of capital goods were able
to significantly improve their result (+43/4%
and +3% respectively), although producersof consumer goods showed a 4% decline.According to the information currently avail-able, nominal exports of goods declined by1% and thus to roughly the same extent asindustrial export sales. The latter did, how-ever, record a perceptible increase in the finalquarter of 2010 when compared with nomin-al exports. Imports were up 2
1/4% on Decem-
ber, which is likely to have been due mainlyto higher energy prices.
ConstructionAs expected, construction output expanded
sharply in January following the weather-related slump in December, and was up by aseasonally adjusted 3
1/2% on the November
figure, which had not yet been affected bythe very adverse weather conditions. Ordersreceived declined perceptibly in December(more recent figures are not yet available).While public sector and commercial custom-ers cut back their demand substantially,housing construction was the only area toshow some increase. The weather conditionsare also likely to have played a part in this.
Labour marketThe labour market situation showed a further
improvement. According to the provisionalfigures of the Federal Statistical Office, thenumber of persons in work in Germany wentup in January by a seasonally adjusted 23,000on the month, ie 463,000, or 1.2%, morethan in the previous year. The vast majority ofthese were probably persons in employment
subject to social security contributions. InDecember, the number of such persons was559,000, or 2.0%, up on the year. Accordingto the Ifo employment barometer and theFederal Employment Agency’s BA-X index,the willingness of enterprises to recruit newstaff remained at a very high level.
Unemployment presents a similarly positive
picture. In February, the official unemploy-ment figure fell by a seasonally adjusted52,000 to 3.07 million. The unemploymentrate (BA concept) went down to 7.3% in Feb-ruary. The figure one year earlier had been8.1%.
PricesCrude oil prices soared at the end of February
owing to the unrest in the Arab world, eventhough the supply in Europe has so far beenunaffected and stocks in the USA are still at ahigh level. At US$104
1/2per barrel on a
monthly average, the spot price for BrentNorth Sea oil was just under 8% higher thanin January.
At US$117
1/4, crude oil prices hit a temporary
peak in early March. Prices were under pres-sure for a time owing to events in Japan. Asthis report went to press, the spot price haddeclined only slightly (US$114) and prices forfuture deliveries of crude oil were beingquoted at premiums – which have fluctuatedonly slightly since the end of February –of US$1
1/2for six-month and US$51/2for
18-month deliveries.Output and

8The fairly steep upward trend in prices at the
upstream stages of the economy continued
initially. Import prices in January went up
again by a seasonally adjusted 1.5% on the
month and prices of domestically produced
goods had gone up 1.8% by February. The
rise in the prices of energy was more
pronounced than in the case of other goods.
The year-on-year increase in import prices
declined slightly in January to 11.8% and the
year-on-year figure for domestic producer
prices had gone up to 6.4% by February.
Although consumer prices did not rise as
sharply in February as in earlier months, the
recent surge in crude oil prices was not fully
reflected in the measured inflation rate. Sea-
sonal food prices went up more sharply than
is usual for this time of year. By contrast,
there was a slight decline in the seasonally
adjusted prices of other goods. The cost of
services remained unchanged, despite the fa-
vourable prices of package holidays. Annual
inflation went up to 2.1% according to the
national CPI and 2.2% according to the HICP.
Public finances1
Statutory health insurance scheme
The statutory health insurance system as a
whole (ie the health insurance institutions
and the health insurance fund) posted a total
surplus of just over €31/2billion in 2010. This
was the result of a surplus of just over €4 bil-
lion for the health insurance fund and a def-
icit of €1/2billion for the health insurance insti-
tutions. The significant improvement on the2009 deficit of €1 billion is chiefly attributable
to much higher central government grants on
the revenue side of the health insurance
fund, which were accompanied by a slower
increase in expenditure by the health insur-
ance institutions. Overall, revenue went up by
almost 6% while, at just under 3%, the rise
in expenditure was only half as strong.
The health insurance institutions recorded a
year-on-year financial deterioration of €11/2
billion. As forecast, the transfers from the
health insurance fund agreed at the end of
2009 were not sufficient to cover the health
insurance institutions’ expenditure. However,
at just under 3%, growth in spending on
benefits was much slower than expected
(+4%) meaning that the gap in funds (disre-
garding revenue from additional contribu-
tions) was considerably smaller than originally
feared. During the course of the year, growth
in spending slowed considerably and, in the
final quarter, the growth rate was only 1%
on the year. Spending on pharmaceuticals,
which have been subject to higher manufac-
turer discounts since August 2010, made a
major contribution to this slowdown. After
extraordinarily high growth rates over the
past two years, sickness benefit may have
also peaked. Just over half of the gap be-
tween health insurance institutions’ expend-
iture and revenue has ultimately been

9plugged by additional contributions in a total
amount of €1/2billion.
The health insurance fund benefited, on the
one hand, from growth in income subject tocompulsory insurance contributions. Despitethe fact that the contribution rate was loweron an annual average, contribution receiptswere up 1%.
2However, the increase in cen-
tral government grants, which – at €151/2bil-
lion – more than doubled, was far more sig-nificant for the favourable financial develop-ment.
3In line with the surplus, the health in-
surance fund’s liquidity reserve also amount-ed to just over €4 billion at the end of 2010.
4
The target value for reserves of 20% of aver-age monthly expenditure (approximately €3billion) was thus already overshot.
After factoring in the savings in benefits
resolved by the Statutory Health InsuranceFinancing Act ( GKV-Finanzierungsgesetz ),
transfers from the health insurance fund in2011 may be more than enough to coverspending by the health insurance institutions– especially since additional central govern-ment funds of €2 billion are included in thesetransfers, whereby total central governmentgrants will remain at more or less the samelevel as in 2010. Furthermore, some institu-tions also received income from additionalcontributions. However, it is precisely due tothe rather favourable financial situation ofthe statutory health insurance scheme as awhole that there is a risk of expendituregrowing at an accelerated pace again. Inautumn 2010, payments by the health insur-ance fund to the health insurance institutionswere fixed on the basis of forecast expend-iture. Owing to the currently more favourable
macroeconomic outlook, the fund’s surplus islikely to be higher than originally estimated(just over €2
1/2billion).Finances of the statutory

2Adjusted for the fact that the contribution rate was
lowered from 15.5% to 14.9% on 1 July 2009, this cor-
responds to an increase of just over 3% for 2010 as a
whole. However, this growth is overstated (by an esti-
mated amount of one percentage point) to the extent
that contribution receipts in 2009 were underreported
on a one-off basis as a result of a changeover in the way
in which payments were recorded following the introduc-
tion of the fund.
3The regular central government grant increased as
planned from €4 billion to €5.5 billion. The grant that
was brought forward to compensate for the lowering of
the contribution rate in mid-2009 was increased from
€3.2 billion to €6.3 billion. In addition, a special grant of
€3.9 billion was paid to offset cyclically-induced revenue
shortfalls.
4The health insurance fund posted a deficit of €21/2bil-
lion in 2009 – the year in which it was set up. However,
in terms of cash flows, the results were largely balanced
as expenditure for 2009 was not made until January
2010. As of 2010, spending recorded using the accruals
method and that recorded based on cash flows are large-
ly in line with one another as a result of the phase shift.Health

10The health insurance fund’s reserves should
be sufficient to finance social equalisation
measures up to and including 2014. The mo-
ment the average additional contribution
measured across all health insurance institu-
tions exceeds 2% of an individual’s income
that is subject to compulsory insurance con-
tributions, the excess amount is refunded by
lowering the individual’s health insurance
contribution in proportion to his/her income.5
The health insurance fund is to cover any rev-
enue shortfalls that the health insurance insti-
tutions may suffer as a result. Additional cen-
tral government funds for this purpose are
not expected before 2015.Public long-term care insurance scheme
According to preliminary figures, the public
long-term care insurance scheme recorded a
slight surplus of just under €1/2billion in 2010,
compared with €1 billion one year previously.
The financial deterioration is due to another
very sharp rise in expenditure of 51/2%,
whereas revenue grew by only just over 2%.
Employee contributions went up by 21/2%
and increased at a faster pace as the year pro-
gressed. By contrast, contributions for recipi-
ents of unemployment benefits were down
again by 11/2% on 2009 and trended sharply
downwards during the year. On an annual
average, pensioner contributions to the long-
term care insurance scheme were 11/2% high-
er. However, this growth came exclusively
during the first half of the year when the
effects of the particularly high pension in-
crease in mid-2009 were still being felt. Since
the freeze in pension adjustments in mid-
2010, pensioner contributions to the long-
term care insurance scheme have remained
more or less unchanged. On the expenditure
side, there were sizeable increases across the
board that were in excess of the higher bene-
fit rates. However, expenditure also rose as a
result of decisions taken by parliament, in
particular with regard to additional remuner-
ation for in-patient care. At the end of 2010,
the public long-term care insurance scheme’s
liquid reserves rose to just over €5 billion as a
result of the surplus.Statutory health insurance scheme

5The average additional contribution required for 2011
has been set at €0 because the group of statutory health
insurance estimators concluded at the end of September
2010 that overall the scheduled transfers from the health

ety of forecast expenditure by the health insurance insti-

11The long-term care insurance institutions are
again expected to post a surplus in 2011 due
to two factors. First, contribution receipts are
likely to increase at a faster pace as a result of
favourable macroeconomic conditions and,
second, benefit rates were not raised at the
start of 2011.6Overall, growth rates on both
the revenue and the expenditure sides may
roughly balance each other out. In subse-
quent years, financial pressure will be intensi-
fied in particular every three years when the
benefit rates are to be raised. Over the com-
ing years, the rather high reserves are likely to
be depleted and an increase in the current
contribution rate of 1.95% (plus 0.25% for
the childless) is on the cards.
Securities markets
Bond market
Issuing activity in the German bond market
increased again in January 2011. Bonds with
a total value of €154.2 billion were issued in
the reporting month, compared with €104.6
billion in December 2010. After deducting re-
demptions – which had decreased – and tak-
ing account of changes in issuers’ holdings of
their own bonds, domestic borrowers sold
€13.2 billion worth of bonds on balance; this
contrasted with net redemptions of €58.7 bil-
lion in the previous month. Sales of foreign
debt securities amounted to €9.6 billion. The
total volume of funds raised in the German
bond market in January thus stood at €22.8
billion.In the reporting month, German enterprises
issued debt securities worth €11.0 billion net,
mainly in the form of paper with maturities of
more than one year. These high sales levels
were primarily attributable to the fact that,
since January 2011, issues of financial prod-
ucts launched in Germany (in particular cer-
tificates), which are generally sold en bloc
to group companies domiciled abroad, have
been recorded as sales of other financial
intermediaries.Finances of the public long-

6Legislators have scheduled the next increase for 1 Janu-
ary 2012. On a weighted average, the benefit rates will
then increase by approximately 2%. After this, the Fed-
eral Government will decide at the beginning of 2014,
and subsequently at three-yearly intervals, whether to
raise the rates again, basing its decision on general price
developments. However, long-term care benefit rates
must not increase more sharply than nominal gross

12In January, credit institutions issued capital
market instruments with a value of €3.0 bil-
lion net compared with redemptions of €13.9
billion in December. The majority of new
bonds (€2.8 billion) were issued by specialised
credit institutions, some of which benefit from
government guarantees, although mortgage
Pfandbriefe and other bank debt securities
which can be structured flexibly were also
sold in net terms (€2.4 billion and €1.8 billion
respectively). By contrast, public Pfandbriefe
continued to be redeemed on balance (€3.9
billion).
The public sector reduced its capital market
debt by €0.9 billion net in January. This was
ultimately attributable solely to state govern-
ments, which redeemed bonds worth €4.2
billion. By contrast, central government in-creased its bond market borrowing by €3.3
billion. It sold mainly five-year Federal notes
(Bobls) and two-year Federal Treasury notes
(Schätze) and, to a lesser extent, 30-year Fed-
eral bonds (€6.3 billion, €6.2 billion and €1.5
billion respectively). By contrast, it redeemed
principally ten-year Federal bonds (€8.1 billion),
but also Treasury discount paper (Bubills) and
Federal savings notes (€0.9 billion and €0.1
billion respectively).
In January, debt securities were acquired pre-
dominantly by foreign investors, who pur-
chased German securities with a net value of
€21.1 billion. Domestic credit institutions on
balance also added bonds worth €7.2 billion
to their portfolios, primarily foreign paper.
By contrast, German non-banks disposed of
debt securities – exclusively domestic paper –
with a net value of €5.6 billion.
Equity market
In January, €0.6 billion worth of new shares
was issued in the German equity market. For
the most part, these were shares of unlisted
companies. At the same time, the volume
of foreign equities outstanding in Germany
rose by €3.1 billion. German credit institu-
tions were the main purchasers of equities;
they increased their exposure by €9.8 billion,
acquiring almost solely German securities on
balance. Domestic non-banks added equities
worth €0.7 billion net to their portfolios. By
contrast, foreign investors sold stocks worth
€6.7 billion net in the German market.Sales and purchases

inflows of €7.0 billion, of which €5.4 billion
was attributable to specialised funds reserved
for institutional investors. Of the mutual
funds open to the general public, open-end
real estate funds (€0.6 billion), mixed
securities-based funds and mixed funds (€0.4
billion in each case) sold the greatest volume
of share certificates, although equity-based
funds also recorded inflows (€0.3 billion). By
contrast, bond-based funds repurchased
shares worth €0.3 billion net. In addition, for-
eign investment companies sold mutual fund
shares worth €2.6 billion in Germany. On bal-
ance, all investor groups acquired mutual
fund shares in January. Domestic non-banks
in particular added shares worth €7.8 billion
net to their portfolios, while foreign investors
and German credit institutions purchased
mutual fund shares with a value of €1.1 bil-
lion and €0.8 billion net respectively.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur-
plus – in unadjusted terms – of €7.2 billion in
January 2011. The result was thus €12.1 bil-
lion down on the month. This was due to both
a smaller trade surplus and a shift to a deficit
in invisible current transactions, which com-
prise services, income and current transfers.
According to the provisional figures of the
Federal Statistical Office, the foreign trade
surplus fell in January by €2.0 billion on the
month to €10.1 billion. After adjustment forseasonal and calendar variations, it decreased
by €2.4 billion to €11.8 billion. The value of
exports fell by 1.0% while the value of im-
ports grew by 2.3%. Compared with the
average of the final quarter of 2010, season-
ally adjusted nominal exports were down by
0.5%, whereas imports increased by 1.8%.
After adjustment for price rises, there was a
decline of just over 2% in the case of both
imports and exports.
A €1.6 billion deficit was recorded in invis-
ibles in January, compared with a surplus of
€8.5 billion in December. A deterioration in
all three sub-accounts played a part in this. A
deficit in current transfers of €3.7 billion fol-
lowed a surplus of €1.1 billion in December.
A major factor in this context is that the re-
ceipts side is usually very high in December
owing to EU subsidy payments. The deficit in
the services account came to €1.2 billion in
January, whereas a surplus of €2.7 billion had
been recorded in December. The main reason
for this development was the higher deficit in
foreign travel, which was due mainly to
greater expenditure. The surplus in cross-
border income decreased from €4.7 billion to
€3.4 billion.
Cross-border portfolio investment resulted in
net capital imports of €2.0 billion in January
2011 after high levels of fund outflows in De-
cember (€32.9 billion). This turnaround was
principally due to the change in foreign port-
folio investors’ behaviour, who acquired do-
mestic securities again in January (€14.7 bil-
lion) after selling them in large quantities
(€50.6 billion) in December. Their attention
was predominantly focused on debt securitiesSales and

hand, were sold in the amount of €7.4 billion.
Domestic investors also increased their hold-
ings in foreign interest-bearing instruments
and equities (€12.7 billion). They primarily
purchased debt securities (€9.6 billion), be-
sides mutual fund shares (€2.6 billion) and
shares (€0.5 billion).
Direct investment resulted in net capital ex-
ports of €9.3 billion in January, following in-
flows of €11.6 billion in December. This was
largely because domestic enterprises were
making injections of capital available to their
foreign affiliates again (€9.5 billion) after
withdrawing funds in the previous month
(€6.7 billion). Non-resident direct investors
barely changed their investment in Germany
(€0.2 billion).
Other statistically recorded investment, com-
prising financial and trade credits (inasmuch
as these do not constitute a part of direct in-
vestment) as well as bank deposits and other
assets, saw net capital imports of €5.7 billion
in January. Against the overall trend, funds
from domestic non-banks flowed abroad in
the amount of €34.2 billion. Of this figure,
€21.4 billion resulted from the activities of
general government (including resolution
agencies), and €12.7 billion from transactions
of enterprises and individuals. There were in-
flows of €39.9 billion into the banking system
in January – €17.9 billion to credit institutions
and €22.0 billion to the Bundesbank. Foreign
investors, in particular, increased their deposits

17The German balance of payments in 2010
Thanks to the significant impetus contributed by foreign trade, the German current account sur-
plus increased slightly in 2010, but still remained considerably below the record high seen in
2007. German enterprises’ exports recovered very robustly in the wake of the global economic
upswing, although the nominal increase in goods imports was a little higher in percentage terms
and also broadly based across regions. The German economy’s comparatively strong presence in
the Asian emerging market economies is helping to channel the cyclical impulses from what is
the current centre of global economic growth to Europe. Germany’s rising demand for imported
intermediate goods and its increasing imports of capital goods and consumer goods are tending
to reduce its external surplus position vis-à-vis the rest of the euro area.
2010 also saw sharp growth in cross-border business-related and financial services on the back
of the economic recovery. By contrast, German residents’ propensity to travel is still far below its
pre-crisis level. This applies especially to private trips abroad, which were curtailed noticeably in
the face of the recession and have not yet recovered. Revenue from income-related transactions
fell further during the reporting period but the corresponding expenditure stabilised after con-
tracting sharply in the two previous years.
The current account surplus in 2010 was accompanied by net capital exports totalling
€1311/2billion, which was attributable primarily to high outflows in direct investment and port-
folio investment. The worldwide economic recovery revived enterprises’ cross-border operations
globally, and the German economy likewise inves ted more abroad. The net capital exports in
portfolio business were due less, however, to the securities transactions of private market partici-
pants than to the transfer of balance sheet positions of German banks and their foreign group
companies to resolution agencies. The transactions associated with this also had a distorting ef-
fect on cross-border unsecuritised credit transactions. An even bigger quantitative impact ensued
from the substantial increase in the Bundesbank’s claims from the TARGET2 payment system
(€1471/2billion), which is recorded in the balance of payments as a capital export. These settle-
ment balances resulted from transfers of central bank money within the Eurosystem and re-
present a claim on the European Central Bank. The growth of the Bundesbank’s claims under
TARGET2 implies no direct change in its level of risk exposure.

18Current account
Underlying trends
Germany’s current account surplus increased
moderately in 2010 by just under €8 billion
vis-à-vis its 2009 level thanks to the overall
very rapid economic recovery both in Ger-
many and abroad as well as the associated
sharp rise in international trade flows. It to-
talled €1411/2billion and amounted to 53/4%
of gross domestic product (GDP), which was
barely more than the ratio registered in the
crisis year 2009 and fell well short of the peak
figure of 71/2% of GDP recorded in 2007. The
current account increase was primarily attrib-
utable to the rise in the foreign trade surplus.
The growth of the current account surplus
was dampened by the fact that the positive
balance from income transactions decreased
and net current transfers to the rest of the
world increased in 2010. The overall deficit
from services was reduced slightly.
The impact of cyclical developments can be
seen more clearly in cross-border revenue
and expenditure flows than in the change in
the balance. Not only trade in goods but also
in most services staged an, in some cases,
marked recovery during the reporting period
after contracting considerably during the re-
cession year 2009. One exception to this was
transfers of investment income, where the in-
coming total decreased in the wake of further
falling interest rates and declining portfolio
investment receipts, albeit not as sharply as in
2009. The outgoing total stabilised at a low
level.While only goods imports have exceeded
their pre-crisis level to date, both imports and
exports of business-related services1, which
likewise fluctuate heavily over the course of
the business cycle, surpassed this mark. Al-
though the combined assets side of these
two cyclically sensitive current account com-
ponents suffered a sharper decline during the
recession, the corresponding import expend-
itures rose more strongly than export receipts
during the reporting period. The fact that the
surplus rose nonetheless is due to the differ-
ence in levels in favour of the assets side. The
dampening effect of the crisis on travel ap-
pears to be lingering longer, however, as resi-
dent business travellers and tourists spent sig-
nificantly less abroad in 2010 than before the
crisis. The same is true of foreign travellers’
spending in Germany.
Goods flows and balance of trade
Global economic influences had a profound
impact on German foreign trade over the
past two years. Following the collapse of
trade flows on the heels of the global reces-
sion in the latter part of 2008 and early part
of 2009, the world economy has had an up-
lifting effect thereafter. The dynamic devel-
opment of many sales markets caused ex-
ports of good to swell by 181/2% in 2010
after they had shrunk by a similar margin in
the recession year 2009. Imports of goods
grew at the even faster pace of 20% during
the period under review. While the surplus on
traded goods increased further in 2010 on

19the back of the strong recovery to reach
€1541/2billion, this is still almost one-tenth
less than the average level between 2004 and2008. This chiefly reflects the slightly strongerdomestic impulse in the current upturn com-pared with the previous upswing.
The strong revival in cross-border goods trade
was concentrated on the first half of 2010,when the seasonally adjusted value of export-ed products increased by around one-sixthand the nominal value of imports of goodssurged by one-quarter. The second half ofthe year saw a more moderate expansion inthe underlying trend for export revenueswhile expenditure on imported goods gener-ally held steady. Given the massive importprice rises towards the end of 2010, the vol-ume of imports may actually have declined atthe end of the period under review. The sig-nificant slowdown in export business can bepartly attributed to the weakening of the up-turn in the high-growth regions of the globaleconomy last summer. This suggests that thesubstantial improvement in the price com-petitiveness of German products on marketsoutside the euro area in the first half of 2010owing to the depreciation of the euro was oflesser significance. The fall-off in foreign de-mand was also a key factor behind the partialloss of momentum of the domestic economicrecovery, which in turn had repercussions onimport demand.
The current growth lead of the German econ-
omy compared with a number of other indus-trial nations can be partly explained by thefact that the upsurge in the global economyis being driven even more than during theGerman foreign trade within

20last upswing by the catching-up processes
underway in the emerging market econ-
omies. The demand pull stemming from
them is based for the most part on products
upon which German enterprises are often
particularly well positioned on the inter-
national stage. The favourable market pos-
ition in intermediate and capital goods is also
attested by the growth in exports for these
two ranges in 2010, which at 21% and
181/2% respectively was exceptionally high in
comparison to 2009. Motor vehicle exports
enjoyed a particularly strong period of
growth, expanding by just under 30% thanks
in part to a boom in demand for high-quality
new cars from certain parts of the world.
Global investment needs in 2010 were not
quite as dynamic due to widespread global
capacity underutilisation, resulting in a
below-average increase in exports of machin-
ery and equipment (+111/2%). At the lower
end were consumer goods producers, whose
exports grew by 71/2%.
The increasing presence in Asian growth mar-
kets, in particular, made up for the fact that
the goods delivered to other euro-area coun-
tries – which is by far the most important
sales region for German products – underper-
formed compared with other regions despite
expanding by a very robust 141/2% in 2010.
Exports to China once again recorded the
biggest leap (+44%), while one-third more
was exported to the South and East Asian
countries excluding China. German exports
to the USA, Japan, and central and eastern
Europe grew by just over one-fifth in each
case. The growth in exports to several large
EU countries, by contrast, was much smaller.Foreign trade by region

21While the 111/2% increase in deliveries to
France came close to reversing the losses ac-crued in 2009, similar rises in goods exportsto the UK and Spain in 2010 fell well short oftheir respective pre-crisis levels.
In the case of imports, the growth gap be-
tween the euro area and non-euro-areacountries was not as large as on the exportfront, with Germany importing 19% moregoods from euro-area partner countries thanin 2009. Taken together with the somewhatmore robust rise in imports from the other EUcountries (+22%), Europe equalled the aver-age rate of increase recorded across all coun-tries. This underlines the fact that the Germaneconomy is channelling the global economicimpulses into Europe by performing compara-tively well in non-European sales markets andthen distributing the resulting import demand
fairly evenly amongst its trading partners (seebox on pages 22 and 23 “The transmissionand regional distribution of the Germaneconomy’s cyclical impulses within Europe”).Given the current global economic setting inwhich the Asian emerging market economiesare acting as the world’s growth engine, thismechanism is helping Germany per se to re-
duce its trade surplus vis-à-vis the rest of theeuro area. In actual fact, Germany’s surplusvis-à-vis the rest of the euro area has not re-bounded in the recovery following the sharpdownward slide endured during the financialand economic crisis: at just under €85 billionin 2010, it was around one-quarter below therecord value seen in 2007.Foreign trade by selected categories of goods in 2010

22Deutsche BundesbankThe transmission and regional distribution of the German economy’s cyclical impulses within Europe
Germany plays an important role in European economic
development owing to its size as a production location
and sales market and its high trade intensity. The German
economy’s strong rebound is thus spilling over to its
neighbouring countries, although the strength of the
stimulus on individual regions varies. Together with Ger-
many’s specific growth profile, this mirrors the diverse
specialisation patterns of the countries concerned with
regard to the provision of goods and services.
During this upturn, in contrast to the past two cycles, the
German economy is largely performing the function of a
growth locomotive for Europe as the present economic
upswing in Germany is more dynamic than that in most
of its neighbouring countries. Thus Germany has accumu-
lated an annualised lead of around 21/2percentage points
since mid-2009 compared with mean GDP growth of all
EU countries excluding Germany.1Germany’s growth
lead over the rest of the euro area is as much as 23/4per-
centage points. The German upswing is being fuelled
chiefly by stimuli from the growth markets outside Eur-
ope. Its European trading partners are also participating
in this. The transmitted impulse mostly takes the form of
an additional demand effect. In addition, there is the im-
petus arising from the expansion of domestic business ac-
tivity in Germany.
However, the individual demand components show not-
able differences with regard to their growth momentum.
The demand for intermediate goods, which the German
economy (chiefly the manufacturing sector) normally
covers through imports, rose sharply with the onset of
the economic upturn. The German economy then
stepped up its procurements of machinery and equip-
ment with a certain time lag. There has only been a ten-
tative pick-up so far in private consumption of German
residents, which could generate demand effects abroad
through both the purchase of foreign consumer goods
and in the form of travel expenditure, after it proved a
stabilising element during the crisis.
Germany’s direct demand effect on its trading partners is
measured as the proportion of goods and services export-ed to Germany in these countries’ GDP. This ratio is large-
ly determined by the degree of openness of the countries
concerned and Germany’s weight as a destination for
their exports. Based on these criteria, the European coun-
tries can be divided into several different groups. On the
one hand, there are the (relatively) large economies,
which tend to have a fairly low degree of openness com-
pared with other European nations and which, with the
exception of France, also transact a below-average share
of their foreign business with German firms. On the other
hand, there are a large number of smaller economies
which exhibit a large structural dependence on exports.
It is noticeable in this context that the trade relationships
of the central and east European neighbouring countries
are concentrated more strongly on Germany than those
of the adjacent western and northern countries, which
have been embedded in the international division of la-
bour for decades. Austria’s and Switzerland’s exchange
of goods with Germany is traditionally likewise particu-
larly close.
In view of the German economy’s growth profile, the
vast majority of its European trading partners benefit
from the fact that they rely relatively strongly on the ex-
port of intermediate goods including energy.2Only with
the Mediterranean countries is the interlinkage of the
supply chains not very advanced so far. In the case of cap-
ital goods the regional structure is more concentrated.
Switzerland and the Czech Republic specialise in supply-
ing machinery and other equipment to German custom-
ers.3The Slovak Republic has a higher weighting in
motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts, followed some
way behind by other central and east European countries
and Spain.
The spillover effects of German business activity tend to
be weaker in countries which mainly deliver consumer
goods to Germany and/or which are holiday destinations.
This holds particularly for the Mediterranean countries
(excluding France but including Portugal).4In the case of
Italy – and Turkey – the export of consumer goods to Ger-
many is more important than supplying tourist services
for German holidaymakers. Poland, too, is relatively

23strongly reliant on exporting consumer goods. Greek and
Cypriot ship owners provide transport services for Ger-
man enterprises on a scale that almost matches German
tourists’ travel expenditure in these countries. Other ser-
vices are dominated by finance and insurance business,
explaining the relatively high revenue shares of the
United Kingdom, Ireland and Switzerland.
The German economy is currently exerting its strongest
knock-on impulses on its eastern neighbours plus Austria
and Switzerland. The production sites there are closelylinked with German enterprises via supply chains. The
“old” EU partners profit from the established trade rela-
tionships, with the Benelux countries tending to benefit
more from the openness of their economies than the
larger economies. The spillover effect of Germany’s
strong economic recovery on the Mediterranean coun-
tries has remained subdued as their exports to Germany
account for only a very small share of their aggregate
economic output; they are focused on consumption-
related goods and services, which have not featured
prominently in Germany’s import growth hitherto.

24Domestic production was the main factor
driving goods imports in 2010. This is demon-
strated by the fact that import growth in
intermediate goods (29%) was more than
twice that of capital goods (14%). After tak-
ing account of the respective pre-crisis level
(which was exceeded by both groups of
goods at the end of the year under review),
there is, however, no substantial difference
as the crisis-induced decline was not as dis-
tinct for capital goods. While consumer
goods imports are less sensitive to cyclical
fluctuations, their comparatively small growth
of 6% during the reporting period means
that the losses from 2009 were no way near
being offset.
Breakdown of invisibles
German enterprises’ service exports rose by
8% in 2010 after declining by 41/2% in 2009.
German firms and households spent just over
6% more on services from foreign providers
in 2010 than one year previously compared
with 5% less in 2009. The negative balance
on the services account stood at €8 billion,
representing an improvement of €21/2billion
on 2009.
The global economic recovery triggered a
sharp rise in cross-border business-related
services. Given the pronounced fluctuations
in foreign trade and close international pro-
duction ties, it is not surprising that the
growth in transport services, which account
for just under one-third of both receipts from
and expenditure on foreign business-related
services, grew especially sharply in 2010 fol-
lowing the crisis-induced declines in 2009.German freight carriers and hauliers earned
171/2% more from their business with foreign
clients on the year, while the amount of such
services provided by non-residents in Ger-
many increased by more than one-fifth. This
far outstripped even the expansion of cross-
border financial and insurance services, in-
come from which increased during the re-
porting period by 7% and expenditure by
9%.
German residents’ wanderlust remains far
below the level seen prior to the financial and
economic crisis. Their travel spending abroad
rose by a mere3/4% in 2010 after contracting
by 6% in 2009. In statistical terms, the
growth resulted solely from the strong recov-
ery in business travel – up by one-tenth –
whereas expenditure on private travel de-
creased again following the sharp drop in
2009 (-5%). That said, the decline of -3/4%
was actually very small. Looking at the main
holiday destinations, it can be seen that the
shift in the expenditure trend over the past
two years towards cheaper countries prompt-
ed by the financial and economic crisis has
persisted to date. The balance of payments
shows, for example,2that travel expenditure
to euro-area Mediterranean countries (ex-
cluding France but including Portugal) was al-
most one-eighth below its 2008 level, while
spending on vacations in Turkey increased
significantly. German holidaymakers again
spent far less money during trips to the Al-
2The accommodation statistics indicate that a greater
number of Germans have tended to spend their holidays
in Germany over the past two years. The number of per-
manent residents who stayed overnight in Germany rose
slightly (+1/4%) in 2009 despite the crisis (and the associ-
ated decline in business travel). In 2010 it increased by a
further 2%.High demand

25pine countries in 2010 than in 2008. Al-
though long-haul journeys to the USA andAsia registered a noticeable increase duringthe year under review, this did not compen-sate for the decline in the crisis year 2009.
Non-residents’ use of domestic hotels and
restaurants grew by 5
1/2% during the report-
ing period after having contracted by 81/2%i n
2009. Travel income generally reacts morestrongly to cyclical effects than travel expend-iture in this segment due to the larger shareof business travellers.
The receipts from cross-border factor income,
which are predominantly made up of earn-ings from invested assets, declined further in2010, primarily because the return on invest-ments abroad decreased again by 3% duringthe reporting period, although this was farless than the year-on-year fall in 2009(-9
1/2%). By contrast, the corresponding pay-
ments to foreign investors equalled the 2009result, which was heavily down on the pre-ceding boom years. The incoming and out-going factor income flows were both de-pressed by the further sharp falls in domesticand foreign interest receipts and the renewedfall in portfolio earnings. Earnings from directinvestment, however, rose noticeably onboth sides of the balance sheet for thesecond consecutive year. Compared to thelow recorded in 2008, foreign investment ex-penditure increased by €22
1/2billion and re-
lated receipts by as much as €37 billion. Over-all, Germany’s clearly positive net externalposition resulted in a substantial inward sur-plus of around €45 billion in 2010, which is€5

26crease in the outward surplus from cross-
border labour was of no quantitative conse-
quence to the overall factor income result.
Current transfers to the rest of the world
grew noticeably in 2010 (+10%), whereas
residents received transfers from foreign
sources in virtually the same volume as they
did in 2009. This divergent development
meant that the corresponding deficit in-
creased by €5 billion to €38 billion in 2010
after having decreased slightly in 2009.
Roughly half of this deficit was made up of
net transfers to the EU budget.
Financial transactions
On the one hand, the transactions recorded
in Germany’s financial account with the rest
of the world reflect the German current ac-
count surplus; on the other hand, they were
heavily influenced in 2010 in addition by
resolution agencies assuming risk positions
from domestic credit institutions (and their
group enterprises) on a large scale, which led
to corresponding capital flows within the bal-
ance of payments both in the portfolio ac-
count and in other investment (see box on
pages 28 and 29). The activities of private fi-
nancial players, who were caught between
the two stools of a critical financial market
situation and a gradually brightening eco-
nomic outlook, played a lesser role. Market
participants found themselves on uncertain
ground when making their portfolio decisions
as the equities and bond markets in the indi-
vidual economies developed very heteroge-
neously. Thus the yield spreads of euro-areagovernment bonds over German Bunds,
which prior to the crisis were negligible,
widened sharply as the crisis of confidence
that spilled over from Greece escalated con-
siderably in spring 2010. At the same time,
positive economic signals increased globally
during the course of the year which, support-
ed by favourable corporate earnings and im-
proved profit outlooks, led to significant
share price gains on most international stock
exchanges. The euro lost just over 8% of its
weighted average value against 21 trading
partners during 2010 amid considerable fluc-
tuations, and by the end of the year was trad-
ing at roughly its launch value from 1999.
The aforementioned influences are also partly
reflected in Germany’s financial transactions
with the rest of the world. Taking portfolio
and direct investment together, more funds
flowed out of Germany in 2010 (€1691/2bil-
lion) than in 2009 (€112 billion). This out-
weighed the net incoming payments on the
current account.
Portfolio investment
The net result from portfolio transactions was
determined not so much by shifts in the over-
all risk and return setting and market partici-
pants’ associated trading positions as by the
aforementioned transfers of securities to
resolution agencies, the upshot of which was
a net capital export from securities transac-
tions totalling €125 billion.
All in all, German investors purchased
€1711/2billion of foreign securities, the bulk
of which were once again debt securities is-
sued by foreign borrowers. In total, GermanBigger deficit

27residents purchased longer-dated bonds and
notes for €156 billion. Two-thirds of the en-tire securities volume was euro-denominated,which on balance was acquired solely by thepublic sector (including resolution agencies).Private agents seem to have shied away frombuying interest-bearing securities as the crisisescalated; this may be due not least to thewidening of bid/offer spreads as the crisis un-furled, which indicated a reduction in the se-curities’ liquidity and – when marked to mar-ket – might have diminished the holders’earnings.
Foreign currency bonds were bought from
non-residents in the amount of €53 billionnet. The bonds were issued in the UnitedStates (€18
1/2billion), the United Kingdom
(€11 billion) and Japan (€71/2billion). The vast
majority were bonds whose value had provedto be non-sustainable during the crisis andwere now transferred to resolution agencies.A sizeable amount of the bonds were asset-backed securities (ABS), an investment and fi-nancing instrument that had been widelyused prior to the crisis. Hence the wish to di-versify is likely to have played a fairly minorrole in the purchase of foreign currencybonds.
Foreign money market instruments failed to
attract resident investors’ interest in 2010.This may well have been due to the lowshort-term interest rates, which made suchpaper unattractive to domestic investors. Thefinal quarter of 2010 was so clearly domin-ated by repayments and sales that this secur-ities segment recorded further outflows offunds (€6
1/2billion net) on the year.Financial transactions

30Domestic investors barely changed their level
of holdings of foreign equities despite the fa-
vourable global economic outlook. One rea-
son for their restraint in this segment may be
that the domestic market, which gained 15%
as measured by the broad CDAX index, re-
corded the strongest growth of the major
currency areas in the wake of the very robust
cyclical recovery in Germany.
By contrast, domestic investors acquired
€22 billion of mutual fund shares in invest-
ment funds based abroad. This segment,
which succeeded in raising its inflows overall,
was therefore able to resume the trend that
had prevailed prior to the start of the crisis.
The mutual funds in question were often for-
eign subsidiaries of domestic financial institu-
tions, with financial locations in Luxembourg(€8 billion) and Ireland (€5 billion) being the
primary beneficiaries of the new investment.
Foreign asset holders became net buyers
again in 2010 after having sold German se-
curities the year before on balance. Even so,
their expenditure of €461/2billion was much
lower than the average annual amount they
had invested in the German securities mar-
kets since the launch of European monetary
union (€117 billion). Non-resident investors
were most interested in longer-term debt se-
curities in 2010, purchasing €481/2billion
worth. They discriminated clearly between
asset classes, however, with public bonds
being particularly sought after because of
their reputation as a safe haven in times of
great financial uncertainty thanks to their top
credit rating and high liquidity. In total, non-
residents bought a record amount of German
public debt instruments (€71 billion). Foreign
demand actually exceeded total net sales by
€20 billion. The high demand was also re-
flected in the falling yield on ten-year Bunds,
which for a time dipped to an all-time low of
just over 2%. By contrast, private bonds with
an initial maturity of over one year once
again recorded net repayments and sales
(€221/2billion). Measured against the extraor-
dinarily high outflows totalling almost €99 bil-
lion in 2009, however, this can be seen as a
slight easing of the situation for bank bonds,
as the outstanding volume of public Pfand-
briefe has been contracting for years for
structural reasons – shrinking by €63 billion
last year alone. In addition, the bulk of do-
mestic corporate bonds and notes are not is-
sued in Germany but rather via financing sub-
sidiaries abroad, so that purchases of theseBalances

31securities by international investors are not
reflected in the German balance of pay-ments.
Domestic money market instruments played
a minor role in non-resident investors’ oper-ations, with no funds being transferred toGermany via this instrument on balance in2010. In the second half of the year, how-ever, purchasing activity picked up strongly(€25
1/2billion), although it should be noted
that this owed much to transactions ofresolution agencies with business partnersabroad.
The price rally on the German stock market
did not entice foreign investors to increasetheir investments in Germany. On balance,they actually sold German equities worth€4 billion. One reason for this may be thepersisting very subdued level of issuance onthe German stock market. Indirect purchasesof domestic equities by non-residents via in-vestment funds increased somewhat, how-ever, with a total of €2
1/2billion flowing into
the German mutual fund industry fromabroad. This means that it has recovered fur-ther from the slump it suffered in 2008.
Direct investmentAfter the rapid declines of 2008 and 2009
owing to the financial and economic crisis,global direct investment rose again slightly in2010 by 1% to US$1.12 trillion according toinitial UNCTAD estimates.
3Direct investment
flowed especially strongly to the rapidlygrowing emerging market economies in Asiaand Latin America. This meant that for thefirst time, more than half of the world’s direct
investment flows were channelled into emer-ging and transition countries. With the recov-ery of the global economy and the improve-ment in profitability, it was primarily the risein reinvested earnings that was the drivingforce behind enterprises’ increased cross-border investment.
The global recovery was also reflected in Ger-
many’s outward and inward direct invest-ment. All in all, this component of the finan-cial accounts saw net capital exports of€44
1/2billion in 2010, representing a year-on-
year increase of more than a half.Portfolio investment

32The main reason for this increase was the
sharp rise in foreign investment by domestic
enterprises (€79 billion, compared with €561/2
in 2009). Contributory factors behind this
were the strengthening global economy,
sharp growth in exports and the improve-
ment in domestic enterprises’ profits. Ger-
man owners notably provided their subsidiar-
ies abroad with additional equity capital
(€42 billion, after €511/2billion in 2009). The
decline compared with 2009 reflects the fact
that mergers and acquisitions by German en-
terprises, which have an impact on this pos-
ition, fell by just under 25% according to
Thomson Reuters data.4Furthermore, Ger-
man direct investment abroad was buoyed by
somewhat higher reinvested earnings thanks
to their improved profitability. (€231/2billion,
after €221/2billion in 2009).5A further
€131/2billion was loaned by domestic owners
to their foreign subsidiaries, whereas the year
before parent companies had borrowed
funds from them in the form of intergroup
loans (€18 billion).
The manufacturing sector was a principal in-
vestor in 2010 (€201/2billion), prominent
among which were vehicle manufacturers
(€13 billion) – mainly via intergroup credit
transactions. The chemical industry was also
a large cross-border investor (€61/2billion).
Both are high-export sectors with extensive
international production chains. As in previ-
ous years, the domestic banking and insur-
ance industry was an especially active investor
(€171/2billion). Part of this, however, resulted
from German banks’ need to offset losses in-
curred by their foreign subsidiaries. At €40 bil-
lion, over half of German direct investmentflowed into other euro-area states. The most
important recipient countries included the
Netherlands (€10 billion), France (€81/2billion)
and Belgium (€7 billion). Aside from Europe,
the USA also seemed a very attractive invest-
ment location (€11 billion), while emerging
markets and developing countries absorbed
€111/2billion of German direct investment.
Foreign direct investment in Germany also re-
corded a rise in 2010, although the increased
amount of €71/2billion to €35 billion was less
than German direct investment abroad. This
included foreign owners supplying their
Germany-based subsidiaries with €23 billion
in the form of (mainly long-term) intergroup
loans and €8 billion in additional equity cap-
ital. Even though foreign direct investment
both into and out of Germany has yet to
reach pre-crisis levels, there is no mistaking
the renewed interest in Germany as an invest-
ment location. Unlike before the crisis, how-
ever, large-scale mergers and acquisitions are
not currently making a major contribution to
this. Reinvested earnings (€51/2billion, up
from €11/2billion in 2009) also generated a
rise in funding inflows to subsidiaries of for-
eign enterprises based in Germany. This re-
flects inter alia the improved profitability of
foreign-owned German enterprises.

33The inflow of capital from foreign owners
particularly benefited their domestic subsid-iaries in manufacturing (€13
1/2billion), and
here primarily the chemical industry (€51/2bil-
lion). In addition, foreign investors strongly in-creased their holdings in the banking and in-surance industry (€10 billion) and in holdingcompanies (€9
1/2billion). This notably in-
cluded inflows of capital into Germany fromBelgium (€9 billion), the USA (€5
1/2billion)
and Central America (€51/2billion), where off-
shore centres play a significant role.
Other investmentWhile portfolio investment and direct invest-
ment both recorded net capital exports, otherinvestment, which includes financial andtrade credits (where not allocated to direct in-vestment) as well as bank deposits and otherassets, registered net capital imports in 2010.The inflow of capital amounted to €57 billion,which was a stark difference to the outflowof €49 billion net in 2009.
In contrast to the overall trend, non-banks re-
corded net capital exports of €15
1/2billion.
The main reason for this was high outflowsof funds through unsecuritised lending by en-terprises and individuals (€48 billion net),who mainly increased their short-term bankdeposits abroad. Conversely, the cross-borderfinancial operations of general governmentled statistically to capital imports (€32
1/2bil-
lion net). The dominant factor in this weretransactions associated with the aforemen-tioned establishment of resolution agencies,which for statistical purposes are reportedunder general government. These agenciesnot only assumed credit claims on entities
abroad – the credit institutions (and their af-filiates) concerned also offloaded credit liabil-ities to non-resident counterparties on a par-ticularly large scale. In addition, the resolutionagencies partly resorted to foreign lenders fortheir ongoing financing.
The outsourcing of financial positions was
partly reflected in two-way cross-bordercredit flows from the banking sector which,however, were outweighed by the credit in-stitutions’ other unsecuritised foreign oper-ations. For example, credit institutions furtherdeleveraged their foreign loan portfolios; alsoaffected was liquidity aid that had previouslybeen granted to group enterprises abroad.

34Deuts che Bun desbankThe dynami cs of the Bun desbank ’s TAR GET2 balan ce
In 2010, the Bun desbank ’s cross- border claims, whi ch for 
statisti cal purposes in clude claims on the E CB, rose by €1 63 
billion net as a result of transa ctions. A su bstantial part of 
this – €147½ billion – was attri buta ble to an expansion of 
the TAR GET2 balan ce. At the en d of 2010, the Bun desbank ’s 
claims un der TAR GET2 stoo d at €325½ billion, all of whi ch 
are claims on the E CB.
A systemati c an d ex ceptionally sharp rise in the Bun des-
bank ’s TAR GET2 claims ﬁ  rst emer ged in 2007. Durin g the 
previous years, Germany ’s TAR GET2 positions ha d exhi bite d 
alternatin g signs an d remaine d mainly within fairly narrow 
boun ds. 
The analysis below explains whi ch transa ctions are pre-
dominantly reﬂ  ected in the TAR GET2 balan ce an d how the 
observe d in crease came a bout. Finally, the asso ciate d risks 
are a ddresse d.
The TARGET2 system for individual payments
Cross- border payments that arise, say, from forei gn tra de 
transa ctions or from se curities or len ding transa ctions with 
non-resi dents are normally carrie d out via the bankin g sys-
tem. These transa ctions are reﬂ  ected in the correspon ding 
(chan ges to the) inter bank claims or lia bilities vis-à-vis the 
rest of the worl d. These types of payments can be settle d 
usin g TAR GET2 by EEA commer cial banks an d Eurosystem central banks. In a ddition to payments between credit 
institutions an d from other systems (e g se curities settlement 
systems), payments un dertaken as part of the Eurosystem ’s 
open market operations are settle d via TAR GET2.1
Origin of TARGET2 balances
If, for example, forei gn fun ds are transferre d to a bank that 
parti cipates in TAR GET2 via the Bun desbank, this results in a 
liability of the Bun desbank to this bank (su ch as in the form 
of a credit to this amount on the bank‘s current a ccount). 
In return, the transa ction generates a Bun desbank claim 
for the same sum on the sen ding central bank. This central 
bank then in turn debits the a ccount of the ori ginatin g com-
mer cial bank. This requires the ori ginatin g commer cial bank 
to have a sufﬁ  cient credit balan ce in central bank money. 
Central bank credit balan ces are primarily provi ded by the 
Eurosystem ’s monetary poli cy reﬁ nan cing operations.
The resultin g claims an d lia bilities generate d at the national 
central banks by the multiple transa ctions over the course 
of a day normally do not fully balan ce out. Un der the terms 
of a Eurosystem a greement, the outstan ding claims an d 
liabilities of all the national central banks parti cipatin g in 
TAR GET2 are transferre d to the E CB at the en d of the busi-
ness day, where they are nette d out. The resultin g TAR GET2 
(net) balan ces hen ce arise from the cross- border distri bution 
of central bank money within the Eurosystem ’s decentralise d 
stru cture.
Statistical implications 
The TAR GET2 balan ce in the Bun desbank ’s balan ce sheet is 
therefore mainly attri buta ble to cross- border transa ctions 
whi ch involve banks that parti cipate in TAR GET2 via the 
Bun desbank.2 On the one han d, it is affe cted by credit insti-
tutions ’ operations on the money an d capital markets an d, 
on the other, by transa ctions carrie d out by the non- bankin g 
sector, whi ch generates payments via the bankin g system. 
As the TAR GET2 balan ce represents a settlement balan ce 
vis-à-vis the E CB, it is classiﬁ  ed as “ cross- border” an d is 
therefore assi gne d to the net external position; the (transa c-
tion-relate d) chan ge is re corded in the balan ce of payments 
within other investment un der the Bun desbank ’s short-term 
external credit balan ce. For the purposes of the balan ce of 
payments, an in crease in TAR GET2 claims is consi dere d to be 
a net capital export. Aroun d half of Germany‘s net capital 
exports sin ce the start of 2007 are attri buta ble to TAR GET2.
From a euro-area perspe ctive, TAR GET2 balan ces lar gely 
disappear, just like the national current a ccount balan ces

other national central banks) on the E CB are offset by the 
liabilities of other national central banks (see chart below).

erate d throu gh the Securities Markets an d Covere d Bon ds 
Pro gramme, an d to a lesser extent throu gh E CB sei gniora ge 
liabilities to the Eurosystem national central banks.
Reason for the increase
The sharp rise in the Bun desbank ’s TAR GET2 balan ce sin ce 
2007 is essentially due to the tension on the money market 
an d pro blems in the bankin g se ctor within the euro area. In 
the years prior to the ﬁ  nan cial crisis, Germany‘s cross- bor-
der payments were virtually balan ced. Credit institutions ’ 
(short-term) net external position in parti cular a cted as a 
kin d of “offsettin g item” in the balan ce of payments. As 
the current a ccount surplus an d frequent net capital imports 
in portfolio transa ctions meant that in comin g payments 
regularly outwei ghe d out goin g payments, most years saw 
outﬂ ows of fun ds (net capital exports) in banks ’ short-term 
credit business. Hen ce temporary TAR GET2 positions were 
qui ckly re duced by private capital ﬂ  ows.
This all chan ged with the ﬁ  nan cial crisis. While fun ds ten ded 
to continue to ﬂ  ow into German banks from a broa d due 
to non- bank payments an d their own operations, after the 
onset of the crisis they were less willin g, an d in some cases 
una ble, to len d these fun ds to forei gn institutions on the 
inter bank market. Instea d, they gradually curtaile d their 
reﬁ nan cing operations with the Bun desbank – at least in the 
aggregate. Thus whereas the reﬁ  nan cing volume attri but-
able to German institutions amounte d to €250 billion at the 
start of 2007 it ha d fallen to €103 billion, by the en d of 2010. 
Conversely, sin ce then banks domi ciled in a num ber of other 
euro-area countries have been re ceivin g lar ger amounts of 
central bank money throu gh the Eurosystem.
The TAR GET2 balan ces a ccumulate d at the national central 
banks thus also reﬂ  ect the chan ged distri bution in reﬁ  -
nan cing operations in the euro area sin ce the start of the 
ﬁ nan cial crisis. This has been fa cilitate d by the ample supply 
of Eurosystem liqui dity as a result of the full allotment of 
all bids in the reﬁ  nan cing operations sin ce O ctober 2008, 
whi ch was inten ded to counter the dislo cations on the 
money market. It is, however, not possi ble to generate more 
liqui dity than this via TAR GET2 as it is a close d system that 
merely transfers liqui dity between a ccounts.
The balan ces will contra ct a gain as the tension in the money 
markets a bates an d the situation in the national bankin g systems eases. There is still mu ch un certainty, however, espe-
cially in the euro-area peripheral countries, whi ch su ggests 
that balan ces will not shrink rapi dly.
Risks from TARGET2 claimsThere is no imme diate chan ge in the level of risk to the Bun-
desbank 
due to the rise in its TAR GET2 settlement a ccounts. 
This risk is not dire ctly relate d to the TAR GET2 positions 
an d arises from the risks asso ciate d with the Eurosystem ’s 
liqui dity supply. Althou gh the Eurosystem as a whole has 
indeed in curre d a dditional ﬁ  nan cial risks by expan ding 
its reﬁ  nan cing operations an d a djustin g the collateral 
framework durin g the ﬁ  nan cial crisis, this was the result of 
a deliberate decision of the E CB Governin g Coun cil aime d 
at maintainin g the ﬁ  nan cial system ’s fun ctional via bility in 
a stress situation.
An a ctual loss will be in curre d only if an d when a Eurosys-
tem counterparty defaults an d the collateral it poste d does 
not realise the full value of the collateralise d reﬁ nan cing 
operations despite the risk control measures applie d by the 
Eurosystem. Any a ctual loss woul d always be borne by the 
Eurosystem as a whole, re gardless of whi ch national bank 
records it. The cost of su ch a loss woul d be share d amon g the 
national banks in line with the capital key. In other wor ds, 
the Bun desbank‘s risk position woul d be just the same if the 
positive settlement balan ce from TAR GET2 were a ccrue d 
not by the Bun desbank but instea d by another Eurosystem 
national bank.

36the first time in two years. All in all, German
banks received €2141/2billion worth of funds
from abroad. The Bundesbank recorded offi-
cial outflows in 2010 of €142 billion net, pri-
marily due to a positive settlement balance
under the TARGET2 large-value payment sys-
tem vis-à-vis the European Central Bank,
which is considered to be a capital export for
balance of payment purposes (€1471/2billion,
see also the box on pages 34 and 35). De-
posits by foreign central banks with the Bun-
desbank also rose by €51/2billion.
Reserve assets
The transaction-related changes in the Bun-
desbank’s reserve assets are shown in a sep-
arate item in the balance of payments. In
2010, the foreign reserves grew by €11/2bil-
lion, chiefly because the Bundesbank in-creased its reserve position with the Inter-
national Monetary Fund (IMF).
Larger than the transaction-related changes
shown in the balance of payments were the
balance-sheet adjustments made to the re-
serve assets in 2010, which are not specified
in the balance of payments in line with inter-
nationally agreed conventions. This led, as in
previous years, to a significant appreciation
due to the customary end-of-year revaluation
of the reserve assets at market prices (€35 bil-
lion). The lion’s share of the revaluation gains
were accounted for by gold (€311/2billion),
with smaller write-ups also recorded for for-
eign currency reserves (€21/2billion) and the
reserve position with the IMF (€1 billion). All
in all, the reserve assets rose by €361/2billion

37Approaches to the measurement and
macroprudential treatment of systemic risk
Effective macroprudential oversight is only possible if systemic risk is properly understood and
measured. Analysis is based on a broad range of approaches in order, if possible, to cover all
important aspects of systemic risk. Macroprudential surveillance also requires a transparent and
coherent set of instruments, which needs to be improved constantly through advances in meas-
uring and analysing systemic risk. Many of these instruments originally constituted micropruden-
tial measures used to accomplish macroprudential objectives. Developing the necessary concepts
and methodology, is, however, still in its infancy. The primary aim at present is therefore to
further enhance the resilience of the financial system by creating a suitable set of macropru-
dential rules. Overall, supervisory agencies the world over currently face two challenges
simultaneously: to make available the proper analytical tools and to establish an effective macro-
prudential framework and set of rules, including any necessary macroprudential intervention
instruments. The Bundesbank is helping accomplish both objectives; first, by developing its own
analytical methodology and, second, by participating in the relevant international bodies.
The present article begins by introducing some of the broad range of existing methodologies
developed to measure systemic risk. The models presented mainly cover contagion effects in the
banking system, which are the decisive factor in the endogenous momentum of financial crises.
With regard to the need for better regulation, the article also illustrates ways of dealing appro-
priately with the systemic relevance of individual financial institutions. It is key here that incen-
tives for financial institutions be created according to market-economy principles and in such a
way that institutions, in their decision-making, take due account of the implications of their
actions for systemic stability.

38Overview
Financial crises follow typical patterns. Like
others before it, the latest financial crisis was
caused primarily by the bursting of an asset
price bubble. Initially, the turbulence caused
by the US subprime mortgage market ap-
peared to be severe yet manageable overall.
It was only a cascade of events which began
in the summer of 2008 and featured massive
disruptions to the functioning of the money
markets, the insolvency of the US investment
bank Lehman Brothers and the near-collapse
of US insurance group AIG that caused the
market turmoil to rapidly develop into a
global financial crisis. The speed and momen-
tousness of these developments set the cur-
rent financial crisis apart from previous crises.
One of the main factors in this was the high
degree of global interconnectedness within
the financial system.
The new dimension of systemic risk caught
both financial institutions and supervisory
authorities unawares. The prevailing para-
digm had been that a financial system was
considered stable if individual actors had
taken sufficient provisions to prevent their
own default, out of self-interest, or as a result
of disciplining market pressure or prudential
rules. As was impressively demonstrated by
the recent financial crisis, this view of finan-
cial stability, which is geared towards individ-
ual institutions, obviously does not go far
enough. A broader view looks at the financial
sector as a system of interdependent agents
which is centred not on the solvency of indi-
vidual intermediaries but on the proper func-
tioning and performance of the system as awhole.1Microprudential supervision is sup-
plemented by a closely related, but at core
independent, macroprudential dimension. In
the meantime, supervisory authorities around
the world are conducting intensive work on
eliminating existing gaps in the supervisory
framework.2Creating a new supervisory
architecture is designed to detect and combat
systemic risk at an early stage.3
Systemic risk has both a cross-sectional di-
mension, such as contagion effects between
markets and financial intermediaries, which
will be discussed in greater depth in this
article, and a time dimension, as is reflected,
for instance, in financial market actors’ cyclic-
al behaviour.4Everything centres on partici-
pants’ interconnectedness and the resulting
1The Bundesbank defines financial stability as the ability
of the financial system to smoothly fulfil its key economic
functions – in particular, the efficient allocation of finan-
cial resources and risks along with the provision of a well
functioning financial infrastructure – at all times, includ-
ing in stress situations and periods of structural upheaval.
See Deutsche Bundesbank, Financial Stability Review
2010, p 7.
2At the international level, work in the Financial Stability
Board (FSB) and the Basel Committee on Banking Super-
vision (BCBS), amongst others, is currently strengthening
inter-agency coordination and driving the development
and implementation of effective regulatory and supervis-
ory standards.
3At the European level, a new financial supervisory sys-
tem, the European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS),
has been created. Its members include the European
Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) and the European Systemic
Risk Board (ESRB), which is tasked with identifying and
averting systemic risk in the EU. The ESRB has two policy
instruments at its disposal: risk warnings and recommen-
dations, which can be addressed to the EU, individual
member states or groups thereof, as well as European or
national supervisory authorities.

39contagion and domino effects.5One reason
these risks played a fairly minor role in regula-
tion and supervision in the past lies in the
difficulty in reliably quantifying them. Neither
a micro analysis of individual institutions nor
a macro view, which looks at the aggregate,
is capable of adequately capturing the com-
plex network of financial market agents and
financial relationships. In the final analysis,
the quality and efficiency of surveillance and
subsequent measures hinge on reliably identi-
fying systemic risk and gauging its impact on
financial stability. It is therefore decisive that
more work be done on developing models to
capture and quantify these risks.
Some of the models that the Bundesbank
employs to monitor endogenous systemic risk
will be introduced below.6These models shall
serve to exemplify what such models can
achieve, but also to illustrate the specific diffi-
culties in identifying and measuring systemic
risk. These approaches should be understood
as a set of analytic instruments which each
look at part of the whole complex of systemic
risk, thereby making an important contribu-
tion to the development and calibration of
macroprudential instruments. In the second
part of this article, the example of systemi-
cally important financial institutions (SIFIs) will
be used to show ways of dealing with sys-
temic risk.
Measuring systemic risk
A variety of features render the financial sec-
tor especially vulnerable to contagion risk.
Through a large number of credit relation-ships, financial market agents are intercon-
nected and thus mutually interdependent.
For instance, banks obtain short-term funding
on the interbank market and also have ties in
the market for medium to long-term funding.
If one institution becomes insolvent, this
therefore impacts directly on its creditors. If
these creditors have to write down their
loans, this can trigger a chain reaction of
sorts, with additional banks experiencing
distress; the crisis then spreads.
That, however, is only the direct form of con-
tagion through contractual relationships. In
addition, there are also indirect contagion
channels which can, precisely in crisis situ-
ations, come into play and thus become dan-
gerous. One significant type of transmission
mechanism involves “fire sales” of assets trig-
gered by problems at individual institutions.
These sales can cause a collapse of prices in
certain market segments, indirectly leading
other financial institutions with exposures to
these markets to adjust their valuations.
Under normal circumstances, an adjustment
mechanism would set in, since investors
would have an increased interest in buying
undervalued assets; however, in a crisis, with
potential buyers sustaining losses of their
own, this does not take place. Maturity and
liquidity transformation are decisive risk
drivers in this context. Long-term illiquid
5In the real world, endogenous and exogenous risks
often overshadow one another. Contagion effects may
often be preceded by an exogenous shock, such as a
deterioration in macroeconomic conditions not originat-
ing in the financial system, or, theoretically, by a terrorist
attack or natural disaster. Endogenous risks then hit a
financial system that has already been weakened.

40assets are financed by relatively short-term
borrowing. At the same time, the non-trans-
parency of illiquid financial products often
contributes to markets drying up. In the case
of information-driven transmission channels,
investors withdraw funds from institutions
merely on the basis of market speculation,
especially if there are any parallels with
distressed institutions (because of similar
business models, investments etc). Here, too,
the impact depends decisively on the extent
of maturity transformation and information
asymmetry.
In the real world, the various contagion chan-
nels are difficult to isolate. This is also reflect-
ed in the variety of approaches to measuring
endogenous systemic risk, which each em-
phasise different aspects. Network models
and statistical interdependence models are
used to analyse contagion channels.7An-
other category of model is designed to quan-
tify individual financial agents’ contribution
to systemic risk.
Network model for the interbank market
Network models, for many central banks now
a standard instrument for analysing the
interbank market, simulate direct contagion
effects between agents. The interbank mar-
ket can be seen as a network, in which the
banks represent the hubs and bilateral lend-
ing relationships the spokes.8There are direct
relationships between two banks as well as
indirect connections across several hubs
(banks). The structure of such a network,
which can be described mathematically, plays
a major role in determining to what extentdefaults can propagate themselves in the sys-
tem through a chain reaction. The level of
banks’ capital and the loss given default are
key determinants of the momentum of the
chain reaction. Various data are used to
quantify the structure of the network. Infor-
mation on capital adequacy and bilateral
exposure volumes can generally be obtained
from prudential reporting data. By contrast,
loss given default must be estimated from
balance sheet data. A model used by the
Bundesbank extends the existing network
approaches in one key point: loss given
default is not assumed to be constant but
instead modelled as a random variable.9This
is because contagion risk can be considerably
underestimated if, as is usually the case, loss
given default is assumed to be constant (see
box on page 42).
One major advantage of network models is
that they explicitly model the transmission of
shocks. This improves supervisors’ ability to
identify weaknesses in the financial system.
However, network models also entail some
severe disadvantages. One is that most
models take insufficient or no account of
changes in behaviour, such as portfolio shifts
or limit adjustments. Here, it is not clear a
priori whether such adjustment responses
dampen or amplify the transmission of

that only a cross-section of the global net-work can be modelled. The necessary data onconnections to non-resident institutions areusually lacking. The Bundesbank thereforeexpressly supports international efforts toclose existing data gaps.

Modelling indirect contagion
Network models do not, as a rule, allow in-
direct contagion effects to be modelled.Moreover, since these models are based onbalance sheet data and prudential reportingdata, they are relatively “sticky” and lesssuited as a timely indicator for assessing thecurrent stability situation. Statistical inter-dependence models seek to close this gap byusing constantly available market prices todepict dependencies in the financial system.Statistical interdependence models differmethodologically from network models, inparticular, in that they do not as such modelcause-and-effect chains. They are based in-stead on statistical correlations.
11At the core,
statistical interdependence models measurehow strongly financial institution A’s (default)risk increases if another institution, B, be-comes distressed. Thus, institution B’s contri-bution to institution A’s risk is measured. Thecorresponding risk metrics are usually takendirectly from market data or derived fromthem (eg from CDS and bond premiums orprobabilities of default derived from optionsor share prices). These are therefore marketassessments of financial institutions’ risk. Thedecisive question is whether the risk metrics“co-move”. Co-movement indicates systemicrisk.
12Studies show that statistical dependen-cies change over time. This has implications
for measuring contagion effects. Since de-pendencies shift when market turmoil occurs,it makes sense, when analysing contagionrisk, to pay particular attention to observa-tions made during periods of turmoil. Twomain statistical methods have emerged: ex-treme value theory, in which the observationsample is a priori restricted to outliers, and
quantile regression, which includes all obser-vations but weights them differently.Contagion effects in the

42Modelling contagion effects in the interbank market
Analysis of contagion effects in the interbank
market using a network model consists of
several steps. First, the bilateral lending rela-
tionships need to be listed in as much detail
as possible. For German credit institutions,
relevant information is available in the credit
register, which is operated by the Deutsche
Bundesbank and in which all credit claims of
German banks are recorded that exceed the
€1.5 million reporting threshold. In this con-
text, the term “claims” refers not only to clas-
sical loans but also includes securities, off-
balance-sheet transactions and positions in
financial derivatives. The individual banks’
capital positions can be inferred from the
regulatory reporting data. In a next step, the
default of one or more institutions is as-
sumed. The lending banks sustain losses
which reduce their capital depending on the
amount of the claim and the assumed loss
given default (LGD). Creditor banks experi-
ence distress if their capital falls below the
required minimum level. The chain reaction
that ensues comes to a halt only if the capital
of the remaining banks is sufficient to absorb
the losses arising from defaulted exposures.
A key determinant of this process is the
assumed LGD, which largely depends on the
value of the collateral or of any guarantees
furnished. However, because the LGD can
only be approximated due to insufficientinformation, most empirical models used to
analyse the interbank market assume con-
stant LGDs in a simplified analysis.1By con-
trast, information available at the Bundes-
bank makes a more precise calibration pos-
sible. Write-downs in relation to the total of a
bank’s non-performing interbank loans serve
as an approximation of the LGD. The model
the Bundesbank uses goes one step further
and models the LGD as a random variable.
The variation of loss provision ratios (between
institutions and over time) makes it possible
to determine their empirical distribution and
to approximate it using a density function.
Approximation by way of a beta distribution
has proven useful in this context.2Thus, a
simulation run for contagion effects on the
interbank market involves not only the – as
before, exogenously – assumed default of an
institution but also the realisation of an LGD.
This means that a contagion channel is to
be understood as the specific realisation of a
random process. Information about the ex-
pected number of defaults can be derived by
repeating simulation runs and forming mean
values.
It can be seen that the assumption of stochas-
tic LGDs has a decisive effect on the results. If,
instead, a constant value such as the mean
were assumed for the LGDs, the contagion
risk would tend to be underestimated.

43A Bundesbank study looks into the co-crash
probabilities among various financial institu-tions.
13The analysis is based on the observed
CDS prices of the financial intermediaries inquestion, with the extreme values of thesepremiums of particular interest. In this con-text, the study looks at how a given institu-tion’s CDS premium reacts to extreme andadverse changes in other institutions’ CDSpremiums. In particular, the study determinesthe probability of a bank’s CDS premiumtaking an extreme value if another observedbank’s CDS premium is particularly high. Onemay also talk of conditional probabilities ofdefault if high CDS premiums appear to indi-cate imminent default. Since observations ofoutliers are rare, methods from extreme valuetheory are used for the stable estimation ofconditional probabilities of default.
14In the
analysis presented here, all conditional prob-abilities of default are calculated for over 200financial intermediaries from 29 countries.Conditional probabilities of default changedconsiderably during the crisis years 2007-2010. This indicates that, during the crisisperiod, systemic importance – understood asrising probability of contagion – increased.
Experience has shown that contagion effects
occur not only between individual institutionsbut also between financial centres and acrossnational borders. Regression models can beused to analyse these transmission channels.In the following, such a model will be used todemonstrate how regional shocks impact onthe German financial system.
15The median
CDS premium serves as an indicator of theaverage default risk of the institutions in agiven region. This indicator can also be calcu-
lated for sub-groups of financial institutions.
In order to expose potential differences
within the German financial system, privatebanks, Landesbanken and insurance institu-tions are studied separately.
16The paper
examines contagion effects on the Germanfinancial sector from Europe (excluding Ger-many), the United States and the Asia-Pacificregion.
17The analysis contains a total of 148
financial institutions from 20 different coun-tries. In the model, the median CDS premiumof a region or group is “explained” by themedian CDS premium of another region. Thecorresponding coefficient in the regressionequation, which is estimated from the data,serves as an indicator of the extent of conta-gion. A high value corresponds to an in-creased danger of contagion. Breaking downthe observation period into sub-intervals andestimating the coefficients separately enablesthe change in systemic risk over time to beshown.
The results of this study show that contagion
effects vary noticeably for the differentgroups of institutions. For banks, the Euro-

44Contagion effects between financial systems – technical background of modelling
A model developed by the Bundesbank can
be used to analyse the contagion effects that
originate in Europe, the United States and
the Asia-Pacific region on the German finan-
cial sector.1For this purpose, private credit
institutions, Landesbanken and insurance
companies are considered separately. The
observation period runs from January 2005
until November 2010.2The median CDS pre-
mium of the institutions examined serves as
an indicator of the general risk situation in
the respective financial system. The median
CDS premium of the German financial system
is explained with the help of the median CDS
premiums of other regions.
The estimation equations are specified using
an ARMA-GARCH model with multiplicative
heteroscedasticity. With this approach it is
possible to model the (conditional) variance
of the risk indicator in a time-variable man-
ner; thus, extreme fluctuations of the risk
indicator can be better taken into account.

Furthermore, the regression equations take
into account general developments in the
financial markets and the real economy ( /C120/C4t).
The control variables are the iTraxx Non-
Financials index, which is calculated from the
100 largest non-financial corporations, Ger-
man DAX volatility (VDAX), the slope of the
yield curve and the median yield of Federal
bonds with a remaining maturity of 8 to 15
years. The non-stationarity of the variables
necessitates modelling in differences (to be
more precise, the differences in the loga-
rithms).
Multiplicative heteroscedasticity is used to
model the exogenous variables Xiof the
variance equation.3To this end, ARMA-GARCH
models are estimated for each of the three
indices representing the three financial systems
under consideration – Europe, the United
States and the Asia-Pacific region. The squared

45pean market plays a much greater role rela-
tive to the US market than it does forinsurers. One possible explanation is thatinsurance companies, especially reinsurers,hold globally more diversified investmentportfolios. Again, systemic risk is seen to fluc-tuate considerably over time.
The above models only represent a small
selection of the approaches to measuringcontagion risk currently in use. The primarybenefit of these models is their ability to as-sess the acute degree of danger. Since thesemodels help to gauge the vulnerability offinancial systems to systemic shocks, they canserve as starting points for macroprudentialmeasures, provided they meet a certainstandard of robustness. By contrast, they areless suited as early warning indicators, as theydo not forecast systemic events.

Modelling individual institutions’systemic importance
An institution’s systemic importance can
cause negative externalities, amongst othersif the market assumes that it enjoys an impli-cit government guarantee because it is con-sidered “too systemic to fail”. The basis fordealing with such institutions lies in identify-ing the degree of systemic importance, whichcan be regarded, for instance, as an individualinstitution’s share of overall systemic risk.The literature contains initial approaches.Most proposals are based on an extensionImpact of regional contagion

46of statistic interdependence models. As ex-
plained in the previous section, these models
measure the marginal impact of the (default)
risk of Bank B on the risk of Bank A. This can
be generalised so that the aggregate financial
system, and not just an individual bank, is
forced to “absorb” this particular bank’s risk.
The marginal impact of a bank on the system
can be interpreted as that bank’s contribution
to systemic risk. One fundamental difficulty
lies in finding a suitable definition of individ-
ual risk and systemic risk. Most proposals for
measuring a financial institution’s contribu-
tion to systemic risk focus on aggregate
losses in assets’ market value as an indicator
of overall risk.19
An approach developed at the Bundesbank
takes a slightly different path.20The under-lying concept is to look at all credit institu-
tions as a single loan portfolio. The system’s
losses are the result of “write-downs” on de-
faulted institutions’ debt. Established credit
risk models21may be used to determine the
distribution of future (uncertain) losses.
On the basis of this underlying concept, sys-
temic risk can be quantified and thus oper-
ationalised as the “expected shortfall” of the
portfolio under observation. Expected short-
fall (ES) is the expected portfolio loss caused
by a rare systemic event. The rare event is
defined here as losses in excess of a given
threshold. A low probability that the rare
event will occur implies a high loss threshold
and vice versa. In traditional portfolio theory,
the probability of occurrence is fixed at a
given value. However, this would not appear
to make sense from a macroprudential per-
spective. Systemic events become more likely
if the situation of individual institutions
deteriorates. It therefore seems appropriate
to link the probability of systemic events
occurring with institutions’ individual prob-
ability of default.22Systemic risk of

K Brunnermeier (2009), CoVaR, Federal Reserve Bank of
New York, Staff Report No 348. This report gives the risk
of market value losses using Value at Risk (VaR). The
CoVaR measure proposed by the authors is defined as
the VaR of the overall system conditional on the VaR of
an individual institution j. According to Adrian and
Brunnermeier, the difference between CoVaR and VaR
measures the risk contribution of institution j.

47The next step is to determine the contri-
butions made by individual banks. This is
done by calculating the change in the overall
risk to the system – measured as expected
shortfall – caused by a one-unit rise in that
institution’s external liabilities.23In economic
terms, a bank’s risk contribution represents
the loss to be expected if this credit institution
becomes distressed, provided the systemic
event has occurred.
It becomes clear that the systemic importance
of a bank cannot be measured solely in terms
of its relative size. That means that a bank
can be systemically important even though it
plays a fairly subordinate role in terms of its
external liabilities. This has consequences for
the current debate on which institutions are
to be regarded as systemically important.
There is no doubt that supervisors need to
pay more attention to systemically important
banks. Quantitative models can help to iden-
tify such banks. A subsequent step could be
to attach rules-based regulatory measures to
systemic importance.
Dealing with systemic risk
The models shown above exemplify the
multidimensionality of measuring systemic
risk and the associated challenges that
adequate prudential supervision has to take
into account. This is also true of the way of
dealing with the risks emanating from SIFIs
outlined below by way of example.24
SIFIs are actors in the financial system which,
at least in principle, are identifiable by size,interconnectedness and a lack of short-term
substitutability. A key principle in the func-
tioning of a market economy is that market
players enter and exit the market. This mech-
anism does not work with SIFIs, since the
insolvency of a SIFI would threaten the proper
functioning of the market as a whole. This
represents a negative externality on the finan-
cial system since the impact of SIFIs’ individualContribution of selected

23This method is based on the partial derivations of the
portfolio expected shortfall according to individual banks’
liabilities. The individual risk contributions being sought
can now be calculated by multiplying these banks’ indi-
vidual marginal contributions by the volume of their
respective liabilities. An efficient simulation technique
(importance sampling) and a fast analytical approxima-
tion solution can be used to calculate expected shortfall
at portfolio level and individual contributions to expected
shortfall.

also certain funds, are classified as SIFIs. For an in-depth

48decisions on systemic stability are not
adequately factored into their decision-making
process. The benefits of their actions are
weighed only against their private costs, not
the macroeconomic costs to the system and
to society at large. To date, the potentially
high macroeconomic costs of an insolvency
have led to implicit public guarantees since
the government, in a crisis, is forced to imple-
ment support measures; the market prices
this in, for instance in the form of financing
advantages and lower risk premiums.25SIFIs
thus enjoy competitive advantages which
potentially hinder efficient resource alloca-
tion.
In order to strengthen individual responsibility
and to create a level playing field, the regula-
tory framework needs to set the right incen-
tives. Where these incentives are insufficient
to control systemic risk, the framework needs
to be extended to include additional direct
measures. Improvements in the framework
created by the new BaselIII capital and liquid-
ity requirements are a step in this direction;
however, in some areas, additional action is
needed in dealing with SIFIs. One key condi-
tion for individual responsibility is a credible
insolvency code which also allows SIFIs to be
wound up without creating prohibitively high
costs to society at large. Bank insolvency
legislation which gives supervisors the neces-
sary instruments for efficient and quick reso-
lution has an ex ante disciplining effect and
should be supplemented with mandatory
resolution plans (living wills) for financial insti-
tutions. Important steps in this direction were
taken in Germany with the recent adoption
of the Restructuring Act.26In addition, theadoption of the BaselIII rules meant a general
strengthening of the capital base. On the
whole, however, the new capital and liquidity
rules in conjunction with special insolvency
legislation will likely not be enough to ad-
equately contain the systemic risk emanating
from SIFIs. The framework therefore needs to
be complemented by additional regulatory
measures.
Owing to the inherent risks of SIFIs, it appears
appropriate in future to gear the intensity
and requirements of supervision and risk
management to the type (eg systemic import-
ance for a certain market segment) and
degree of financial institutions’ systemic im-
portance.27This presupposes that systemic
importance can be established largely reli-
ably. Quantitative models of the type
described above can make a key contribution
in this regard.
More extensive direct intervention, which is
being discussed in response to the financial
crisis, focuses on directly regulating banks’
size, eg via business volume, or business
25Rating agencies circumvent this problem by publishing
stand-alone ratings and ratings which take account of ex-
plicit and implicit guarantees.

These measures can address components ofsystemic risk but not necessarily risks caused,say, by interconnections between institutions.The cases of the US investment bank LehmanBrothers and the LTCM hedge fund showthat market players that are active only incertain business segments may also have animpact on the entire system and thus besystemically important. In addition, to a cer-tain degree this could involve the loss ofefficiency gains in the banking sector whichare created by economies of scale or syner-gies and, in some cases, are beneficial to theeconomy as a whole.
29
Generally speaking, approaches that seek tointernalise the negative externalities causedby SIFIs are therefore preferable to directrestrictions on size or activities. Such ap-proaches are more flexible and more in linewith the principles of a market economysince market participants are free in theirdecisions once they have taken proper ac-count of the risks. However, this presupposesthat systemic risk – or individual institutions’contribution to such risk – can be quantifiedobjectively. No such generally acceptedstandard has emerged yet, although pro-mising work is being conducted in this field.The international debate is currently centredon two instruments for internalising theeconomic costs of systemic risk: systemiccapital surcharges, also possibly in the formof contingent capital, and steering taxes(“Pigouvian taxes”).
30In an ideal world, capital surcharges would beset such that the contribution of the institu-tion in question to the risk of the overall sys-tem is adequately backed by capital.
31Higher
resilience reduces systemic risk overall. In theshort run, surcharges initially act as quantita-tive regulation since asset growth is con-strained by available capital. In the mediumrun, however, institutions can raise theircapital and thus determine their size them-selves. Capital surcharges also act like a priceinstrument in banks’ decision-making pro-cesses as the financing structure shifts to
28See US Securities and Exchange Commission (2010),

29Empirical studies indicate, however, that the motiv-
ation for consolidation among the larger banks is no
longer rising economies of scale but an expansion of
market power and therefore margin increases. See

ducing the moral hazard posed by systemically important
financial institutions; for a proposal for a Pigouvian tax
see eg German Council of Economic Experts Working
Paper 04/2010, Reducing Systemic Relevance: A Pro-
posal. In addition to these instruments, the possibility of
a progressive scale of deposit insurance premiums

being discussed; this would affect only deposit-taking
institutions, however. See V Acharya (2009), Systemic

Theoretically, negative effects caused by sys-
temic importance can be reversed or offset
by regulation. However, in practice it is
unrealistic to internalise all negative exter-
nalities since even the correct quantification
of such effects is currently difficult. Capital
surcharges are intended to take account of
uncertainty in measuring externalities and
also to include the potential welfare gains
that international firms, for instance, experi-
ence as a result of large interconnected
banks. Surcharges could take the form of
equity or, in addition to or as a substitute for
equity, conceivably also the form of contin-
gent capital instruments. Their aim is to avoid
discretionary intervention by regulators and
instead provide for an automatic strengthen-
ing of the capital base in the event of a
crisis.33The Financial Stability Board (FSB) and
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
(BCBS) are currently developing proposals to
flesh out the concept of systemic capital
surcharges which are intended to increase
institutions’ individual resilience above and
beyond the BaselIII requirements. Other rele-
vant work by the FSB relates to the intensity
of supervision, and restructuring and reso-
lution regimes.34
A Pigouvian tax is another way of internalis-
ing negative externalities. The tax rate is
chosen such that the tax corresponds to the
level of negative externalities. One advantage
of this tax is that it pursues a precisely defined
objective – reducing systemic importance –
whereas capital surcharges are potentially in-tended to perform several tasks which are
not always compatible: increasing resilience,
internalising negative externalities and damp-
ing procyclicality. In the case of both the
Pigouvian tax and capital surcharges, uncer-
tainty in establishing systemic importance has
thus far made it difficult to calibrate for the
internalisation of negative externalities. This is
one reason why enhancing resilience, which
capital surcharges make possible, is an im-
portant aspect. In both cases, however, the
affected institutions can be expected to take
evasive action, such as transferring business
lines abroad or to less regulated areas. Clos-
ing existing regulatory gaps will therefore be
a decisive issue.
The examples listed here refer to dealing with
systemic risk caused by SIFIs. However, risk
arises not just as a result of the systemic im-
portance of individual financial institutions
but potentially also as a consequence of herd-
ing behaviour among multiple market partici-
pants or weaknesses in market infrastructure,
which allow a shock to spread within the sys-
tem and thus jeopardise it. One possibility of

network hubs in the financial market which
prevent the transmission of shock waves. This
could be accomplished, for instance, by
increasingly settling transactions through
central counterparties (CCPs), an approach
which is currently being pursued.
Summary
Identifying and measuring systemic risk in a
bid to contain it is the precondition for any
suitable reorganisation of the framework and
of specific regulatory measures. Modelling
contagion effects permits improved assess-
ment of the risk that negative shocks will be
transmitted between regions and financialintermediaries. By measuring the contribu-
tions which individual financial institutions
make to systemic risk, macroprudential in-
struments such as capital surcharges can
be calibrated such that SIFIs factor negative
externalities into their decisions. Measuring
systemic risk requires a broad spectrum of
approaches in order to adequately capture
the manifold aspects of risk. However, the
process of developing suitable concepts and
methodologies is still in its infancy. The reper-
cussions of changes in framework conditions
on the emergence of risk also need to be
taken into account. This represents a chal-
lenge to future macroprudential regulation
and supervision; the future stability of the
financial system depends on this challenge

53The implications of the financial crisis
for monetary policy
Through resolute key interest rate cuts and unconventional monetary policy measures, central
banks, together with governments, have stabilised the international financial system and pre-
vented the global economy from sliding into a lasting depression. However, as the direct effects
of the crisis subside, central banks are now confronted with new tasks. The exit from the numer-
ous non-standard monetary policy measures must be timed appropriately so as to avoid the
harmful longer-term side-effects associated with the huge expansion of central banks’ role in
financial market intermediation during the crisis. Furthermore, the possible implications of the
financial crisis for the fundamental focus of monetary policy are currently being debated. One
particular issue is whether monetary policy – as a core central bank task – should be supple-
mented with an explicit mandate for financial stability, and whether the current embodiment of
the objective of price stability in the form of low inflation rates is still appropriate.
Although no definitive answers to these questions can be expected at present, certain initial indi-
cations can be identified in this respect. Adopting an additional explicit financial stability object-
ive harbours the risk of overloading monetary policy and triggering a loss of credibility. This does
not mean that central banks have no part to play in macroprudential oversight. On the contrary,
the existing regulation should be supplemented with a separate macroprudential policy focusing
on systemic risk, in which the central banks play a key role. However, it is vital to have a clear
assignment of responsibilities between monetary policy and other central bank functions, thus
enabling monetary policymakers to continue to focus on the task of safeguarding price stability.
Nonetheless, monetary policy must, in future, place greater emphasis on financial market devel-
opments in its evaluation of inflation risk and be structured symmetrically across the financial
cycle. The medium-term focus of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy and its monetary
pillar have already laid the ground for this. The objective of price stability should continue to be
understood in terms of low inflation rates; a higher inflation target would entail major costs, and
a changeover to price-level targeting would likewise have drawbacks.
Finally, central banks face institutional challenges. In particular, the sharp rise in sovereign debt
in the wake of the crisis means that central banks have to preserve their independence and cred-
ibility in a difficult macroeconomic environment. This will be more easily achieved if monetary
policy remains focused on price stability, while fiscal policymakers ensure fiscal discipline, thus
providing monetary policymakers with the leeway they need to achieve their primary objective.

54Introduction
The financial and economic crisis has thrown
up particular challenges for monetary policy-
makers across the world. Combined with
government measures, the central banks’
resolute interest rate cuts and use of uncon-
ventional monetary policy tools stabilised the
international financial system and prevented
the global economy from sliding into a lasting
depression. However, as the direct effects of
the crisis subside, central banks face new
tasks. This article examines some of these
challenges, focusing mainly on the role of
monetary policy as the core function of a cen-
tral bank and leaving aside the issue of
whether central banks should, as a result of
the crisis, adopt additional functions above
and beyond their monetary policy mandate,
eg in safeguarding financial stability.1
The experiences of the crisis have brought the
“monetary policy consensus” formed in the
years prior to the crisis under scrutiny.2While
the details of monetary policy differed signifi-
cantly among central banks, the primary
monetary policy objective under the pre-crisis
consensus was, in simplified terms, price sta-
bility, defined as a stabilisation of the inflation
rate to around 2% across a horizon of ap-
proximately two years. Steering short-term
interest rates was considered a sufficient
means of achieving this aim. Central bank
forecasts played a prominent role in monet-
ary policy decision-making, while the monet-
ary dimension increasingly took a back seat in
many forecast models. Furthermore, under
the consensus, capital markets were mostly
assumed to be efficient, meaning that finan-cial market imperfections and their potential
macroeconomic effects were not taken into
account. Temporary inefficiencies, such as
asset price bubbles, were considered possible,
but the majority view was that monetary pol-
icy, with its interest rate instrument, could do
little to counteract such developments.
Microprudential supervision – which focuses
on individual financial institutions – was re-
garded as an adequate means of preventing
financial crises. It was thought that monetary
policymakers should intervene only once a fi-
nancial crisis had occurred, minimising the
macroeconomic damage through resolute
interest rate cuts.
The current debate regarding the pre-crisis
consensus covers a number of different as-
pects. Some critics believe that monetary pol-
icy contributed to the high risk appetite in the
financial system and thus to the build-up of
the crisis.3There have therefore been calls for
monetary policy to shoulder more of the
responsibility for safeguarding financial stabil-
ity. Some observers advocate raising the
targeted rate of inflation; others propose
gearing monetary policy to the level of prices
rather than the inflation rate. In addition,
some see benefit in retaining the non-
standard measures on a more permanent
basis.

55Before we can look at these proposals in
more detail, we must first analyse the causes
of the financial crisis.
Key measures taken by the Eurosystem
during the crisis
In August 2007, uncertainty regarding the ex-
tent of possible liquidity and solvency risk in
the banking sector led market participants
across the world to lose confidence in each
other. This manifested itself, in particular, in a
swift fall in interbank market activity, a sud-
den rise in money market rates and a percep-
tible increase in risk premiums. To safeguard
the steering of short-term money market
rates and counteract banks’ growing liquidity
uncertainties, the Eurosystem initially con-
ducted additional longer-term open market
operations. Furthermore, an ample supply of
liquidity enabled the banking sector to
“frontload” liquidity used to cover the min-
imum reserve requirements, which provided
it with additional security.4
After the US investment bank Lehman Broth-
ers collapsed in September 2008, the situ-
ation on the international financial markets
deteriorated dramatically. The sharp rise in
risk premiums caused the interbank markets
and some securities markets to become il-
liquid, triggering a fall in financial market
prices across the world. Declining inflationary
pressures following the clear reduction in real
economic activity allowed the Governing
Council of the ECB to drastically cut the Euro-
system’s key interest rates between October
2008 and May 2009. Furthermore, the Gov-erning Council adopted a number of add-
itional non-standard monetary policy meas-
ures designed to support lending to the
private sector (“enhanced credit support”).
They included a fixed-rate tender procedure
with full allotment in all refinancing oper-
ations and a lowering of the credit quality
threshold for eligible assets.
Following a period of recovery, tensions
began to emerge in 2010, particularly in the
markets for the sovereign bonds of some
euro-area countries. The ensuing loss in con-
fidence ultimately led to a drop in asset prices
and a further sharp decline in market liquid-
ity, which prompted the Governing Council
of the ECB to adopt the Securities Markets
Programme in May 2010.5The aim of this
programme is to restore the proper function-
ing of securities markets and the monetary
policy transmission mechanism.
Through its numerous measures, the Eurosys-
tem played a key role in limiting the negative
impact of the crisis on the financial system
and thus also on the real economy. Even so,
viewing this crisis management in isolation
does not provide us with sufficient insight to
draw the necessary conclusions regarding the
4This “frontloading” entails banks holding higher bal-
ances at the central bank at the beginning of a mainten-
ance period and lower ones towards the end so that they
fulfil their reserve requirements at an early stage.
5Together with the EU, the governments of the euro-
area countries responded to the tensions by introducing
an extensive stabilisation mechanism comprising the
European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) and
the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), via which
loans can be granted to financially distressed euro-area
countries on condition of a firm commitment to fulfil
consolidation requirements. The targeted overall volume
is a maximum of €750 billion, to which the EFSM is to
contribute €60 billion, the EFSF €440 billion and the IMF
€250 billion.August 2007:

57implications for monetary policy. Instead, we
must also look at the preceding period, as
that is when the unsound developments
which subsequently escalated into a crisis
were formed.
Financial institutions’ risk appetite too
high
The years preceding the outbreak of the fi-
nancial crisis were characterised by compara-
tively weak fluctuations in the real economy,
low inflation and low interest rates world-
wide. In this environment, a multitude of fi-
nancial innovations, the deregulation of the
financial markets and favourable financing
conditions led to a high risk appetite in the
financial system and, consequently, to marked
growth in the leverage ratio within the bank-
ing sector.
One major reason for these developments
was that the risk dampening effect of capital
was weakened – or even circumvented – by
financial innovations in the run-up to the
crisis.6It became possible to trade credit risk
and transfer it to third parties.7The securitisa-
tion of credit risk via special-purpose vehicles
played a part in eroding capital requirements
by enabling banks to offload, in particular,
mortgage loans from their balance sheets.8
Banks then took structured credit products is-
sued by the special-purpose vehicles back
onto their balance sheets. The improved rat-
ing for senior securitisation tranches achieved
through this securitisation allowed banks to
reduce their regulatory capital requirements,
enabling them to expand their credit supplyand further increasing their leverage ratio.
Contrary to its intended purpose, the se-
curitisation of credit risk led, all in all, to such
risk being concentrated intransparently at
banks rather than being distributed across
the financial sector.9
The realistic prospect of a sharp cut in policy
rates in the event of a financial crisis gener-
ated an additional incentive to take on higher
risks.10This monetary policy philosophy of
“mopping up” after a crisis led market par-
ticipants to expect that they would receive all
of the profits associated with heightened risk
if they were successful but would not have to
bear the costs in full in the event of a loss. In
this respect, the crucial factor was not low
interest rates per se but market participants’
expectations that the central bank would be-
have in a specific way. The fact that monetary
policymakers more or less explicitly promised
6This refers to the risk dampening effect of investors’ li-
ability, which stems from their residual claim on corpor-
ate earnings.

(2009), Manufacturing Tail Risk: A Perspective on the Fi-
nancial Crisis of 2007-2009, Foundations and Trends in
Finance 4, pp 247-325.
8For example, loans were gathered into pools of assets
and sold to special-purpose vehicles. The special-purpose
vehicles then issued fixed-income securities to refinance
the asset pools. The risk diversification involved in port-
folio formation improved the credit rating of more senior
tranches compared with the underlying credit claims.
In addition, banks selling such loans provided their
special-purpose vehicles with short-term credit lines to
cover liquidity risk without having to hold additional cap-
ital for this purpose. This further enhanced the credit rat-
ing of the special-purpose vehicles and helped to circum-
vent the relevant capital requirements. See M K Brunner-
meier (2009), Deciphering the Liquidity and Credit

crisis encouraged the development of collect-
ive moral hazard, which contributed to in-
stability.11
Vulnerability of the financial system due
to systemic risk
The high leverage ratio caused individual fi-
nancial institutions to face high credit and li-
quidity risk. The fact that interdependencies
among institutions (external effects) were dis-
regarded additionally increased the risk with-
in the financial system and contributed to the
build-up of systemic risk.12Maturity trans-
formation took on extreme proportions.
When short-term loans failed to be rolled
over following the outbreak of the crisis,
leading to a large-scale withdrawal of liquid-
ity, financial institutions were forced to make
fire sales.13
Although these fire sales were rational from
the point of view of the individual institu-
tions, they further accelerated the fall in
prices on the market for mortgage-backed
securities, which then spilled over to other
assets and widened the circle of market par-
ticipants who were affected by the turmoil.14
This led to a self-reinforcing process of on-
going fire sales, falling asset prices and loss
spirals, which was driven by feedback ef-
fects.15The uncertainty surrounding the risk
positions of financial institutions caused the
crisis of confidence to spill over to the inter-
bank money market. The freezing of this
market illustrated that some markets partici-
pants had underestimated the liquidity riskand thus also the interdependence between
funding liquidity and market liquidity.
Given this diagnosis, the question is whether
and to what extent monetary policy should
not only be the lender of last resort in a crisis
but also take account of financial stability
developments before a crisis occurs. The
issues bound up in this question touch on
fundamental areas of monetary policy:
should financial stability become an add-
itional, separate monetary policy objective
alongside price stability? Is an inflation rate of
around 2% still an appropriate implementa-
tion of the price stability objective? How
should monetary policy take account of
developments in the financial markets?

14In addition, fire sales were intensified by the fact that
individual financial institutions, such as investment banks,
were aiming for a constant leverage ratio.
15In addition, certain types of bank run occurred, with
institutional investors, above all, withdrawing their de-
posits. This also included a failure to roll over short-term
loans (eg money market instruments) and withdrawals
from hedge funds and investment funds. By sending out
a negative signal and triggering feedback effects via the
money and capital markets, this had a destabilising effect
on the entire financial system. See D W Diamond and P H

59A separate toolkit is needed for financial
stability
In the pre-crisis period, debate concerning
the connection between asset price develop-
ments, financial stability and monetary policy
was largely restricted to the question of
whether it is advantageous to use interest
rates to burst financial market bubbles at an
early stage (“leaning against the wind”). The
majority view was that this kind of financial
stability mandate for monetary policy would
not be beneficial, since the policy rate would
be too blunt a tool for this purpose and asset
price bubbles would be very difficult to iden-
tify at a sufficiently early stage.16
However, the financial crisis has caused the
focus of the debate to shift and expand. Dis-
cussions are now less restricted to interest
rate policy on its own and instead take a
broad perspective on the macro and systemic
dimensions of the financial markets. It has be-
come apparent that certain incentive struc-
tures within the financial system and the
existing supervision – which was primarily
focused on individual institutions – strongly
encouraged the build-up of credit-financed
imbalances. The path embarked upon at an
international and European level of placing a
greater emphasis on macroprudential aspects
in analysis and regulation should therefore
continue to be followed consistently. In par-
ticular, excessive leverage and overly risky
business models can be better combated by
tightening capital requirements and improv-
ing the methods for recording risk pos-
itions.17The numerous interdependencies within the
financial system likewise call for a macropru-
dential approach. Financial intermediaries in
the entire system must be treated differently
according to their importance, and regula-
tions should also apply to financial institutions
outside of the conventional banking sector if
they fulfil similar functions.18Large and/or
strongly interconnected financial institutions
whose collapse could endanger the entire
financial system must be more strictly regu-
lated and should meet higher capital and
liquidity requirements. Surveillance of finan-
cial innovations must take account of their
complexity and, where applicable, their con-
centration at financial intermediaries so that
unsound developments can be combated at
an early stage.
The objective of such a macroprudential pol-
icy is to curtail systemic risk, thus strengthen-
ing the resilience of the financial system as a
whole. It aims to ensure that externalities
within the financial system – the procyclicality
and interconnectedness of financial institu-
tions – can be addressed.19Consequently,
existing supervisory tools must be expanded
or adjusted so as to prevent systemic risk
from arising in future and radically reduce the

Price stability remains primary objective
of monetary policy
There is now a broad consensus that the ob-
jective of financial stability requires its own
toolkit. This objective can also be pursued by
central banks; indeed, given their expertise, it
makes sense for them to play a major role in
analysing financial stability. However, the
interest rate tool of monetary policy is too un-
differentiated to do justice to the complexity
of the objective of financial stability. Monet-
ary policy – and its toolkit – must therefore
remain focused on price stability and must
not be overburdened with additional object-
ives. The credibility of monetary policy de-
pends on both the clarity of its objectives and
transparency regarding its limitations. Adopt-
ing financial stability as an additional, separ-
ate monetary policy objective harbours the
risk of raising unrealistic expectations regard-
ing the effectiveness of the monetary policy
instruments.
The advantage of having separate instru-
ments for price and financial stability be-
comes clear when there is a need for monet-
ary and macroprudential policy to be adjusted
in different directions. If, for instance, there
are no indications of a rise in inflation risk but
there are signs of excessive risks emerging in
the financial system, it is possible to respond
appropriately by making macroprudential
tools more restrictive and leaving the monet-
ary policy stance unchanged. This example il-lustrates the need to draw a clear distinction
between the objective of price stability and
that of financial stability and ensure a clear
assignment of tools and measures.20
As developments on the money and financial
markets are of key importance to both mon-
etary and macroprudential policy, there are
significant interdependencies between the
policy areas that must be taken into account.
For example, banks’ lending is not only im-
portant for monetary policy transmission but
is also relevant to macroprudential policy.
This opens up the possibility of monetary and
macroprudential policy decisions and meas-
ures complementing each other, but also har-
bours the danger of them cancelling each
other out.21For instance, macroprudential
tools aimed at curtailing the procyclicality of
the financial sector could counteract monet-
ary policy decisions (eg possible lending limits
or upper limits for credit growth).
There is no single answer to the question of
how necessary or advantageous a coordin-
ation of policy areas is. Very little practical ex-
perience has yet been gained in this area,22
although some studies provide certain im-
portant initial indications in this regard.
Current investigations corroborate the view
that the rate of inflation can be stabilised
20See A Cukierman (2011), Reflections on the crisis and
on its lessons for regulatory reform and for central bank
policies, Journal of Financial Stability 7, pp 26-37.
21However, individual economic agents will not neces-
sarily be affected in the same way. For example, the im-
pact of macroprudential measures on the consumption

61comparatively well if macroprudential policy
has its own toolkit and works alongside mon-
etary policy.23However, harmful effects with
respect to the volatility of the inflation rate
can arise if monetary policy ignores the im-
pact of macroprudential tools on the financial
markets.24If the central bank takes decisions
regarding both macroprudential and monet-
ary policy instruments, additional fluctuations
in the rate of inflation compared with the
monetary policy status quo (where only mon-
etary policy has a stabilising effect) can be
virtually ruled out, and such fluctuations
could even be reduced overall.25
While these results should be regarded as
provisional and thus interpreted with caution,
they indicate that a clear assignment of ob-
jectives and instruments is generally condu-
cive to achieving the objectives of both price
and financial stability.26Assuming that there
will be an adequate exchange of information
between monetary and macroprudential
policy in the future, the existing studies give
no cause to fear that the objective of price
stability will have to be compromised. Stable
prices will remain assured as long as mon-
etary policy instruments are employed with a
sole focus on price developments. Nonethe-
less, we must guard against unrealistic ex-
pectations. The process of developing a gen-
erally accepted modelling and operational
framework for macroprudential analysis is still
in its infancy.Price stability should continue to be
understood in terms of low inflation
rates
Although the pre-crisis consensus that monet-
ary policy should primarily be focused on the
objective of price stability remains valid, the
question arises as to whether the experiences
of the crisis should have implications for the
specific form that this price stability objective
takes. In the context of the massive interest
rate cuts, some observers proposed setting a
higher inflation target so that monetary policy
would not hit the natural lower bound of nom-
inal interest rates as quickly, meaning that the
leeway for monetary policy stabilisation would

24See section 4 of P Angelini, S Neri and F Panetta
(2010). By contrast, the volatility of the inflation rate can
be effectively contained if monetary policy decisions take
explicit account of the impact of macroprudential tools
on financial stability. This seems intuitively obvious if the
macroprudential framework is simplistically interpreted
as additional parameters of the model economy, which
are taken into account by optimal monetary policy. See

26The results must be interpreted with caution for two
reasons. First, the underlying dynamic stochastic general
equilibrium (DSGE) models only approximately reproduce
the complex interactions between the real and the finan-
cial sector. Second, this research is only in its infancy; at
present, only a few models allow a simultaneous analysis
of monetary and macroprudential policy. Furthermore,
they have not yet succeeded in adequately capturing net-
work risk. See also D Beau, L Clerc and B Mojon (2011),

62not be as readily restricted.27A credibly higher
inflation target than the rate of roughly 2%
under the pre-crisis consensus, which would,
under normal circumstances, be accompanied
by a correspondingly higher nominal interest
rate, would allow more aggressive interest rate
cuts – and thus more pronounced reductions
of the real interest rate – in the event of a crisis.
This would increase monetary policy flexibility
in the event of a severe economic slump ac-
companied by a risk of deflation.28
However, the substantial and ongoing wel-
fare losses associated with a rise in the infla-
tion target provide an argument against this
proposal. The most notable factors in this
context would be the misallocation of re-
sources resulting from the inflation-related
distortion of relative prices, the negative
effects of inflation on real cash holdings, the
rise in the variability of inflation – and its im-
plications for risk premiums – associated with
a higher level of inflation and distortions
caused by the interplay of inflation and non-
neutralities in the tax system. Above all, how-
ever, it is the loss in the credibility of monet-
ary policy caused by such a discretionary
measure that makes this proposal highly
problematic.29The likely destabilisation of
inflation expectations would make it signifi-
cantly more difficult for the central bank to
achieve its (possibly higher) inflation target
and safeguard macroeconomic stability.30
As an additional alternative for mitigating the
possible restriction of monetary policy flexibil-
ity at the lower bound of interest rates, it was
proposed that, instead of formulating price
stability as a quantitative target for the infla-tion rate, the price level – or, more precisely,
the price level path – should be targeted.31In
theory, the strategy of price-level targeting
does indeed have a number of advantageous
characteristics compared with a strategy of
inflation targeting. Advocates of price-level
targeting stress the fact that it opens up the
option of influencing private sector inflation
expectations and of combating deflation risk
in this way in the event of a crisis. However, it
is doubtful whether, in the event of an acute
risk of deflation, a change in the target speci-
fication would be suitable for achieving the
desired positive effect on private sector infla-
tion expectations.32A more serious problem
is that, compared with optimal monetary
policy, a strategy of price-level targeting is
associated with several additional drawbacks
which cast doubt over whether such a
change of strategy would be beneficial.33

30Furthermore, there is a danger that a higher inflation
target would not only fail to achieve the desired improve-
ment in macroeconomic stability but would also contrib-
ute to the build-up of the next crisis. In their decisions,
households and enterprises would take account of the
central bank’s increased leeway for interest rate cuts in
the event of a crisis and would take on greater risks.

63All in all, this means that neither raising the
inflation target nor switching to price-level
targeting would be appropriate from the
point of view of economic stability. Instead,
the problem must be tackled at root; the
existing misguided incentives and regulatory
loopholes must be eliminated in order to
make severe crises as unlikely as possible. It
is, in any case, questionable whether the lee-
way of monetary policy at the lower bound
of the nominal short-term money market
rates was really that limited. Certainly, central
banks’ experiences regarding the effective-
ness of unconventional measures during the
crisis give no cause to view the lower bound
of the interest rate as a binding restriction on
the effectiveness of monetary policy.
Monetary policy should be structured
symmetrically
Financial and price stability should not be
intermingled in the context of monetary pol-
icy objectives. However, it is undeniable that
a monetary policy geared to price stability
within the usual timeline of under two years
provides no guarantee of preventing unsound
developments in the financial markets that
spill over to the real economy and thus jeop-
ardise price stability. Against this backdrop,
the question arises as to how the experiences
of the crisis should be incorporated into mon-
etary policy decision-making processes.
In the pre-crisis period, monetary policy deci-
sions were often based on models in which
the financial sector played only a minor role,
or no role at all. Consequently, an obviousand important lesson to be learned from the
crisis is that the theoretical and empirical
basis for monetary policy decisions must, in
future, attach greater importance to both the
banking sector and financial frictions.
In principle, the Eurosystem’s monetary policy
strategy already provides the basis for this
change, as the figures from real economic an-
alyses are cross-checked against those from
monetary analyses. In the more recent past,
moreover, the Eurosystem has stepped up its
efforts to continually enhance its monetary
analysis, including with regard to new early
warning indicators for unsound develop-
ments in the financial markets.34The aim is to
identify irregularities in the patterns of a
number of variables at an early stage. As an
unusual pattern in loan developments and
monetary aggregates can provide valuable in-
dications of excessive credit creation, “lean-
ing against the wind” at an early stage to en-
sure that monetary policy is symmetrically
structured across the financial cycle can make
a key contribution to financial stability.35This
requires an extension of the usual monetary
policy decision-making horizon, as unsound
financial developments tend to build up over
a fairly long period of time.
Taking greater account of the financial sector
and financial frictions in future, including in
dynamic general equilibrium models, will not
only make it possible to improve the way in

64which the monetary policy transmission pro-
cess is captured empirically; these models will
also allow a structural interpretation of mon-
etary and loan developments.36Combined
with the cross-checking of data from other
sources, such as the Bank Lending Survey,
the financial accounts or the banking statis-
tics, this will provide a comprehensive view of
developments at the current end. During the
financial crisis, this enabled the Eurosystem to
respond in a targeted manner to the tensions
in the money markets on the basis of the
data processed in its monetary pillar.
Non-standard monetary policy measures
not a long-term solution
During the financial crisis, the Eurosystem –
like the central banks of other major econom-
ic regions – took unconventional monetary
policy measures on an unprecedented scale.
Given the importance of bank loans for cor-
porate financing in the euro area, these
measures, described in their entirety as
“enhanced credit support” by the Eurosys-
tem, were focused on the banking system.
Other central banks selected other tools be-
cause of the specific characteristics of their
countries’ financial systems. The aim was to
use operational central bank measures to
compensate for the consequences of the ab-
rupt decline in market liquidity. One key
measure taken by the Eurosystem was the
move to full allotment in the refinancing
operations, which allowed banks to maintain
excess liquidity. The temporary presence of
excess liquidity in the banking sector did not,
however, give rise to any direct risks to pricestability, as neither the monetary aggregate
nor loans grew inordinately.
During the crisis, the non-standard measures
played a substantial part in stabilising the fi-
nancial markets and preventing the real econ-
omy from sliding into a lasting depression. At
the same time, however, the crisis-related li-
quidity measures should not be unduly pro-
longed. As a “long-term medication”, they
would have harmful side-effects. Generous li-
quidity operations allow even those banks
that are no longer able to raise any funds on
the private funding markets to continue oper-
ating. This runs the risk of necessary restruc-
turing in parts of the banking system being
delayed or not taking place at all. Conse-
quently, unsustainable structures are retained
in the financial sector, thus hampering the
medium to long-term outlook for the real
economy.
The restructuring or winding up of banks that
do not have a sustainable business model is,
first and foremost, the responsibility of the
owners and, where banks are severely dis-
tressed, of the corresponding national pru-
dential supervisory authorities and govern-
ments. Resorting to the use of monetary pol-
icy tools to stabilise the financial sector is, if
at all, only appropriate on a temporary basis
in the event of dysfunctionalities that affect
the entire banking system and fundamentally
impair the effectiveness of monetary policy.
In parallel with improvements on the inter-
bank and financial markets, there must there-
fore be a prompt exit from the extensive

65intermediation of central banks brought
about by the crisis.
From an economic perspective, another rea-
son why a sustained provision of excess li-quidity would be problematic is that the roleof banks in maturity transformation wouldlargely be transferred to the central bank.The only cause for banks to face a scarcity ofcentral bank liquidity would be the limitedavailability of eligible assets, and this liquiditywould not need to be managed to the sameextent as before. This could thus severely re-duce banks’ incentives to better match thematurities of their assets and liabilities and,ultimately, could strongly and lastingly inflatecentral bank balance sheets.
Ultimately, a continuing provision of excess li-
quidity in an environment of normalisinginterbank markets would also have harmfuleffects on the signalling role of short-terminterest rates in monetary policy manage-ment. For example, by switching to full allot-ment in the refinancing operations, the Euro-system effectively abandoned its previouslyquite precise control of short-term moneymarket rates. Since October 2008, these rateshave therefore fluctuated between the de-posit rate and the main refinancing rate, de-pending on the prevailing liquidity conditions.This was tolerated during the crisis in order tocreate incentives for banks to continue par-ticipating in the money market. Nonetheless,if full allotment in the refinancing operationswere to be maintained in the long term, thiswould hamper effective and efficient interestrate management, which is predicated onhaving a transparent relationship betweenthe key interest rate, money market rates and
interest rates that are relevant to the realeconomy.
37
As the crisis-related turmoil on the financialmarkets subsides, central banks must ensurethat the implementation of monetary policydoes not distort price formation on the finan-cial markets. In future, banks must make add-itional arrangements so that they develop agreater resilience to markets drying up. Toachieve this, amongst other things, a morebalanced maturity structure is needed forassets and liabilities on banks’ balance sheetscompared with the pre-crisis situation ofsome institutions – as is already envisaged inthe new liquidity standards under the regula-tory initiative “Basel III”. This will require afundamental rethinking of those businessmodels that have, until now, been basedheavily and lopsidedly on maturity and risktransformation, with insufficient profitabilityand capital adequacy.
One of the key lessons of the financial crisis is
that the use of financial stabilisation meas-ures in an environment where private agentsare heavily indebted rapidly leads to fiscal dif-ficulties. The knock-on effects of unsustain-able public finances on the financial marketsexacerbates these markets’ problems. Therisk of a downward spiral emerges. Thisunderscores the need for regulations whichimprove the resilience of the financial system.
37Here, the term “effectiveness” means the effective
management of the level of short-term money market
rates given limited volatility. The term “efficiency” refers
to the requirement to ensure that money market man-
agement is consistent with market practice and involves
appropriate operational costs.Long-term use

66Furthermore, it opens up a perspective on the
ongoing regulation debate, which needs to
address the issue of the specific risks that can
be caused by unsound fiscal policy. For ex-
ample, the government bonds held by banks
as proprietary positions play a special role in
two respects: government bonds are treated
as comparatively low-risk assets under the
existing capital requirements, and they also
serve to fulfil future regulatory liquidity stand-
ards as they are considered to be particularly
liquid assets. Both of these factors provide
additional incentives for banks to hold
government bonds. If these incentives lead to
a reduction in government bond yields, this
could encourage an expansion of govern-
ment debt, which, in turn, would be likely to
have a negative overall effect on financial
stability. The crisis has shown that this wouldnot be without consequences for monetary
policy.
During the crisis, in addition to expanding
their revolving refinancing operations, central
banks tried to exert a stronger influence on
the tense market conditions through direct
purchases in certain segments of the secur-
ities market. The Eurosystem made less use of
such purchase programmes than other cen-
tral banks. In spring 2009, the Governing
Council of the ECB adopted the Covered
Bonds Purchase Programme. In addition, the
Governing Council decided, in view of the
sovereign debt crisis which began to escalate
in spring 2010, to initiate the Securities Mar-
kets Programme, the volume and duration of
which were not limited in advance, with the
aim of restoring the proper functioning of
securities markets and the monetary policy
transmission mechanism. Other central banks
made far greater use of direct purchases, ex-
tending their balance sheets even further as a
result.38Here, too, the improved situation on
the financial markets means that central
banks should reduce their extended balance
sheets. A continuation of central bank inter-
ventions in price formation on the financial
markets should be viewed critically, especially
given that central banks tend not to have a
permanent information advantage over mar-
ket participants. If a central bank’s interven-
tions give market participants the impression
that it is aiming for an unsustainable, inordin-Total assets of major central

67ately high price level, its actions trigger arbi-
trage mechanisms. There is a danger that it
will only be possible to maintain the targeted
level as long as the securities purchases actu-
ally continue – or market participants expect
them to continue.
In addition, if central banks purchase govern-
ment bonds for monetary policy purposes,
particularly when government deficits and
debt levels are high, they run the risk of blur-
ring the boundaries between monetary and
fiscal policy. This might harm the credibility of
monetary policy. For this reason, too, it is a
matter of urgency to increase the resilience
of the financial system to fiscal risk.
Conclusion
In the period prior to the global financial cri-
sis, the macroeconomic environment was
stable and financing conditions were com-
paratively favourable. Combined with the
existing institutional framework of the finan-
cial markets and continual innovations in fi-
nancial products, this led to the emergence
of fundamental misguided incentives. An an-
alysis of the crisis provides conclusions re-
garding the implications for monetary policy
and the regulation of the financial system,
which should, in future, be more focused on
curtailing these kinds of unsound develop-
ments.
To ensure financial and price stability, there
must be a clear assignment of responsibilities
and the most suitable tools to the two distinct
policy areas. While monetary policy, with thekey interest rate as its primary tool, should
continue to focus on ensuring price stability,
a macroprudential regulatory framework that
is geared to systemic risk requires its own ap-
propriate toolkit in order to safeguard finan-
cial stability. Although interdependencies be-
tween the policy areas are possible and
should thus be taken into account, there is
no reason to fear that, given a clear assign-
ment of tasks aimed at ensuring a stable fi-
nancial system, the objective of price stability
would suffer as a result.
The objective of price stability should con-
tinue to be understood in terms of low rates
of inflation. Neither raising the inflation tar-
get nor switching to price-level targeting can
be considered appropriate from a stability
policy perspective. The experiences of the fi-
nancial crisis have not altered this in any re-
spect. As the Eurosystem’s monetary policy
leeway at the lower bound of interest rates
was not significantly limited, the welfare
losses, misguided incentives and credibility
problems associated with proposals to raise
the inflation target or introduce price-level
targeting provide an unequivocal argument
against their implementation.
The Eurosystem’s monetary policy has the ob-
jective of maintaining price stability over the
medium term. To achieve this aim, it must be
organised more symmetrically across the fi-
nancial cycle than in the past. In doing this,
the Eurosystem will ensure price stability and,
at the same time, help to maintain financial
stability. In this context, it is necessary to con-
tinuously enhance the analytical framework
and expand the monetary policy decision-Clear

68making horizon. Through the analysis of
monetary and credit aggregates, the monet-
ary pillar already plays an important role in
identifying unsound developments in the fi-
nancial markets and adopting a medium-
term focus.
With regard to the implementation of monet-
ary policy, it is of vital importance that the
non-standard monetary policy measures are
withdrawn as soon as possible. The uncon-
ventional measures and, in particular, the fullallotment in the refinancing operations are
associated with a number of misguided in-
centives for financial institutions and a sub-
stantial impairment of the Eurosystem’s abil-
ity to effectively manage short-term money
market rates.
Although future crises in the financial mar-
kets and the real economy cannot be ruled
out, the implementation of these findings will
play an important role in reducing the likeli-
hood of such events as far as possible.Restrict use of
