Economic conditions
Underlying trends
Economic output in Germany declined in the 
first quarter of this year. Many services sectors 
suffered larger losses than in the previous quar -
ter due to measures to protect against corona -
virus being tightened and prolonged. More -
over, purchases that had been brought forward 
to the second half of 2020 in anticipation of 
the VAT cut being rolled back were now ab -
sent. Alongside the heavily restricted opportun -
ities for consumption, this, too, is likely to have 
contributed to a considerable downturn in con -
sumer spending. The areas of the economy not 
directly affected by the measures continued to 
exhibit a robust underlying trend, though some 
sectors suffered under temporary strains. For 
instance, the return to the higher VAT rates 
dampened activity in the construction sector as 
well, with exceptionally unfavourable weather 
conditions in January and February placing an 
additional burden on output. In addition, the 
upward trend in industrial output was not sus -
tained in the first two months of the year. Scar -
city of key intermediate goods, particularly in 
the automotive sector, is likely to have played a 
part in this. The manufacturing sector is not fa -
cing any new demand problems, by contrast. 
Order intake, which was already strong, has 
continued to rise since the start of the year, 
driven by dynamic demand from abroad. Sur -
veys by the ifo Institute in March also indicate a 
further brightening of business conditions and 
markedly improved expectations for output 
and business, suggesting that industry will con -
tinue to recover.
Industry
German industrial output experienced a re -
newed and steeper drop in February 2021 com -
pared with January, falling by a seasonally ad -justed 1¾% month on month. A key factor in 
this decline is likely to have been bottlenecks in 
the supply of intermediate goods, leading to 
delays in production despite healthy order 
books. Purchasing managers reported record 
extensions of delivery times in February, for ex -
ample.1 The automotive sector was hit particu -
larly hard, with a strong drop in output of 
around 7% on the month. According to data 
from the German Association of the Automo -
tive Industry, the number of motor vehicles 
produced remained at a depressed level in 
March as well. Even excluding the automotive 
sector, however, manufacturing output in Feb -
ruary fell distinctly short of its January level. 
Averaged across January and February, total in -
dustrial output remained at the level of the pre -
vious quarter, but was 1¾% higher after fac -
toring out the automotive sector. Broken down 
by main industrial groupings, production of 
intermediate goods, in particular, significantly 
exceeded the level posted in the final quarter 
of 2020, whereas production of capital goods 
remained slightly below that level on account 
of weak motor vehicle output. Production of 
consumer goods also fell markedly short of the 
level recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Overall, industrial output in January and Febru -
ary was still roughly 3% lower than the pre-  
crisis level of the fourth quarter of 2019.
There was a further significant rise in industrial 
orders in February. Compared with the previous 
month, they grew by a seasonally adjusted 
1¼% and, averaged across January and Febru -
ary, exceeded the level of the fourth quarter of 
2020 by 1%. After excluding developments in 
large orders, which are more prone to fluctu -
ations, the growth was somewhat higher still. 
Broken down by sector, demand rose mainly 
for intermediate goods, with a clear increase of 
3¼%, whilst remaining almost constant for German eco -

capital goods. Manufacturers of consumer 
goods saw a steep drop in orders (-2¼%). 
Looking at the individual regions, German in -
dustrial enterprises benefited mainly from dy -
namic demand from non- euro area countries, 
which pushed up the inflow of orders by 3¼%. 
Orders received from the euro area remained 
unchanged, however, while domestic orders 
even fell slightly below the level of the fourth 
quarter of 2020. Overall, order intake has now 
seen a considerable recovery from the setbacks 
of the previous year. On an average of January 
and February, it surpassed the pre- crisis level of 
the fourth quarter of 2019 by an impressive 
7%.
Nominal industrial sales contracted in February 
by a seasonally adjusted 1½% compared with 
the previous month, in which they had already 
seen a slight decline. However, taking an aver -
age of January and February, they were only 
slightly short of the level posted in the fourth 
quarter of 2020. Steep growth for manufactur -
ers of intermediate goods (+2%) contrasted 
with significant decreases for producers of cap -
ital goods (-1¾%) and consumer goods (-1¼%). 
In regional terms, there was a drop in domestic 
sales (-1¾%) and sales in the euro area (-1¼%), 
whereas sales in non- euro area countries 
picked up strongly (+2¾%).
Nominal exports of goods continued to rise dis -
tinctly in February 2021, up by a seasonally ad -
justed 1% on the month. The average of the 
previous quarter was even substantially ex -
ceeded in January and February, with an in -
crease of 3%. Exports were markedly higher in 
real terms, too (+1¾%). Exports to non- euro 
area countries rose strongly, while exports to 
the euro area edged up only slightly. The gap 
compared with the pre- crisis level narrowed 
further, to 2% overall. Nominal imports of 
goods rose steeply in February, thus offsetting 
the sharp drop in January. On an average of the 
two months, imports were just below the level 
of the preceding quarter (-½%) but they were 
down significantly in price-  adjusted terms 
(-3½%). The large decrease related to imports Industrial sales

from both euro area and non- euro area coun -
tries. Overall, imports still fell distinctly short of 
the pre- crisis level (by 2½%).
Construction
In February, construction output fell for the 
second month in a row, albeit in seasonally ad -
justed terms at a considerably slower rate of 
-1¼% compared with the slump in January. 
Taking the average of January and February, 
construction output was appreciably lower 
than the fourth- quarter level (-7½%). The de -
cline was particularly sharp in the finishing 
trades, where it probably became clear that 
some construction work was brought forward 
in the run- up to the VAT reduction being re -
versed at the start of the year. In the main con -
struction sector, unfavourable weather condi -
tions were the main factor dampening output 
in the first two months of the year. January saw 
high levels of rainfall, while spells of low tem -
peratures probably played a role in February. 
The recent uptick in orders received in January 
– the latest period for which statistics are avail -
able – is not the only indicator that the down -
turn in the construction sector should not per -
sist too long. Surveys by the ifo Institute show 
that the reach of the order books also remained 
at a high level in March. Furthermore, equip -
ment utilisation rose steeply again, pointing to 
brisk activity.
Labour market
The effects of shrinking economic output on 
the labour market continue to be seen mainly 
in short- time work for economic reasons, take- 
up of which increased significantly in January. 
According to the initial estimate by the Federal 
Employment Agency, the number of persons in 
short- time work rose to 2.85 million. This 
equates to 8.5% of all employees subject to so -
cial security contributions. In addition, the fig -
ure for December was revised upwards dis -
tinctly. The number of short- time workers in January was therefore up by just over 40% 
compared with October 2020, before the re -
strictions put in place to contain the pandemic 
had been tightened again. Viewed in terms of 
the number of people in short- time work, the 
latest increase in take-  up may even be under -
estimated. As some sectors had to scale back 
their economic activity sharply, the average loss 
of working hours per short-  time worker rose 
from just over one- third in October to nearly 
three-  fifths recently. This means that the vol -
ume of labour lost through short- time work for 
economic reasons has actually more than 
doubled in the last three months up to January 
(+124%). In February, the number of short- time 
workers is likely to have remained at this high 
level but the ifo Institute estimates that there 
could have been a slight decrease in March. In 
any case, the number of registrations for short- 
time work fell quite considerably as contain -
ment measures were relaxed in March.
Employment remained stable at the start of the 
year. A marginal rise in January was followed 
by an equally small decrease in February. Exclu -
sively low- paid part- time employment and self- 
employment both dropped further. After strong 
increases in previous months, employment sub -
ject to social security contributions barely went 
up in January, however. In March, indicators of 
willingness to recruit new staff improved across 
the board, but most of the surveys were con -
ducted after easing of restrictions had been an -
nounced in early March and before infection 
rates started to rise significantly at the end of 
March. It is possible, then, that the cautiously 
optimistic expectations cannot be met in the 
short term.
Registered unemployment also remained 
broadly unchanged towards the end of the 
period under review. Compared with the previ -
ous month, the number of unemployed people 
in March dropped slightly, by 8,000 after sea -
sonal adjustment, following a similarly sized in -
crease in February. The unemployment rate 
persisted at 6.0%. One year into the pandemic,

lowance, which is more structural, continued 
to rise slightly, whereas the number of recipi -
ents of unemployment benefit under the statu -
tory insurance scheme went down further.
Prices
Due, in particular, to production cutbacks by 
OPEC and its partners, crude oil prices picked 
up markedly until mid- March and then sub -
sided somewhat as infection rates worsened in 
many places. As this report went to press, a 
barrel of Brent crude oil cost US$67, around 
three times as much as one year earlier, when 
prices had slumped to almost US$20. Crude oil 
futures were again trading at slight discounts. 
The discount on crude oil futures was US$2¼ 
for deliveries six months ahead and US$4½ for 
deliveries 12 months ahead.
Import prices rose at a similar rate in February 
as in January, after seasonal adjustment. This 
was true of not only energy but also other 
goods. Industrial producer prices likewise saw 
another marked increase, both including and 
excluding energy. Prices of total imports ex -
ceeded the previous year’s level for the first 
time since 2019, with growth of 1½%. In in -
dustrial domestic sales, the corresponding rate 
expanded to roughly 2%.
Consumer prices as measured by the Harmon -
ised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) increased 
by a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in March and 
thus just as strongly as in February.2 Due to 
crude oil prices continuing to edge up, con -
sumer prices for energy were once again raised 
markedly. Prices for food and services also went 
up further. The prices of non- energy industrial 
goods declined, however, because clothing 
prices did not increase as strongly as they usu -
ally do in March. Annual headline HICP infla -
tion rose from 1.6% to 2.0%. After stripping 
out energy and food, however, it remained vir -
tually constant at 1.6%. The headline rate ac -
cording to the national consumer price index 
(CPI) climbed from 1.3% to 1.7%. The gap be -tween the CPI and HICP rates is largely attribut -
able to a statistical effect which has already 
caused the HICP rate to increase since January.3 
This effect will initially fade in the coming 
months and then move into negative territory. 
Nonetheless, due to the base effect caused by 
the temporary lowering of VAT in 2020,4 higher 
HICP inflation can be expected from the second 
half of the year. As things stand today, it could 
be significantly higher than 3% towards the 
end of the year.
Public finances
Local government finances
In spite of the coronavirus crisis, local govern -
ment budgets (core budgets and off-  budget 
entities) ended 2020 with a surplus of €2 bil -
lion. In the final quarter, they received inflows 
of more than €13 billion of aid from central 
and state government, resulting in a very high 
quarterly surplus. However, the surplus for the 
year as a whole was down by €3½ billion on 
2019.
In 2020, local government revenue rose con -
siderably overall, by 4½% (€13 billion). This was 
chiefly due to significantly higher transfers from 
state government (+20%, or €22 billion), which 
partly consisted of a greatly expanded volume 
of funds passed on from central government. 
This included, in particular, compensation from 
central and state government for local business 
tax shortfalls (€11 billion). In addition, central 
government raised its share in the costs of 
accom modation for those receiving unemploy -
ment benefit II by half. The rule- based general 
purpose grants from state government and 
transfers for investment also saw dynamic 
growth of 6% and 17%, respectively. Further -

induced non- payments of fees, such as those 
for child daycare facilities, which were largely 
closed at one point. Overall, local govern -
ments’ receipts from fees receded by 7% (-€2½ 
billion) and tax revenue fell by 6% (-€6 billion). 
Net receipts from local business tax decreased  
sharply (-12%, or €5 billion), even though the 
requirement to transfer the increased share of 
local business tax to state government for the 
purpose of reorganising the revenue- sharing 
scheme expired last year. Taken in isolation, net 
income thus increased by €3½ billion. How -
ever, the compensation from central and state 
government agreed upon last summer to cover 
coronavirus- related local business tax shortfalls 
was still based on significantly less favourable 
expectations. The local governments’ substan -
tial share of income tax also declined less 
strongly than expected (-4%).
Local government expenditure increased 
sharply, by 6% (+€16 billion). Spending on per -
sonnel, a particularly large expenditure item, 
rose by 4½%. In addition to a wage increase of 
just over 1% for salaried employees, the corona -
virus bonuses agreed upon last autumn also 
had an impact. Spending on social benefits 
rose by 3%, appearing to be only slightly af -
fected by the coronavirus crisis. Accommoda -
tion costs for those receiving unemployment 
benefit II, for instance, went up by only 2½%, 
although the eligibility criteria had been eased 
on account of the crisis. After offsetting the in -
creased central government contribution, net 
relief amounted to just under €3 billion on the 
year. However, local governments significantly 
increased transfers to their own institutions 
(+24%, or €1½ billion) and grants to non-  
government entities (+12%, or €2½ billion), 
probably also including local public transport 
enterprises. How much of this came from the 
regionalisation funds, which central govern -
ment raised by €2½ billion for such purposes, 
cannot be deduced from the data. Fixed asset 
formation has also seen dynamic growth dur -
ing the coronavirus crisis, rising by 12%, or €4 
billion.Local government finances are likely to be 
harder hit by the coronavirus crisis this year. Tax 
revenue is set to remain significantly below the 
level anticipated prior to the crisis. No further 
central and state government compensation 
for local business tax shortfalls is planned. 
However, as last year’s payments were retro -
spectively deemed rather generous, local gov -
ernments may have already been partly com -
pensated on balance for this year’s local busi -
ness tax shortfalls. In addition, the federal 
states could make special adjustments in the 
current year to prevent the crisis from depress -
ing their transfers within the municipal revenue- 
sharing scheme. The federal states will have to 
continue stepping in to ensure that no sharp 
cutbacks in investment are necessary and to 
avoid a structural increase in cash advances in 
due course. They are constitutionally respon -
sible for ensuring that their local governments 
receive financing commensurate with the tasks 
of the latter.Sharp rise in

In spite of the fiscal surplus, local government 
debt increased by just over €½ billion last year. 
At end- 2020, it amounted to €137 billion (in -
cluding liabilities to the public sector). 
Investment- related credit market debt rose sig -
nificantly by €3 billion to €101 billion, with high 
increases in Bavaria, Baden-  Württemberg and 
Hesse. Debt in the public sector, by contrast, 
declined by €1 billion. Cash advances de -
creased by €1½ billion to €33 billion. The fed -
eral states of North Rhine-  Westphalia and Saar -
land reported the steepest declines. Saarland 
assumed just under €½ billion of local govern -
ment cash advances; a further €½ billion is to 
follow. As part of a debt relief programme 
(Saarlandpakt ), the federal state will thus take 
on half of the outstanding cash advances from 
end- 2019. In return, the local governments 
must repay the remaining half over the long 
term.
The development of local government finances 
during the coronavirus crisis demonstrates 
once again that they are in need of a funda -
mental reform. Their current set- up is problem -
atic because local government revenue is very 
volatile. Strong cyclical fluctuations or critical 
slumps in local business tax revenue and trans -
fers from state government put many local 
government budgets under short-  term adjust -
ment pressure. Without swift support, this may 
result in an undesirable budgetary policy at the 
local government level – one that might be -
come erratic or make structural use of cash ad -
vances unintended for this purpose. Major pol -
itical obstacles would have to be overcome in 
order for a reform to take place. However, 
crisis- resilient local government budgets could 
significantly improve the German financial con -
stitution.5
Securities markets
Bond market
At €131.1 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in February 2021 was down on the previous month’s figure (€159.5 billion). 
After deducting redemptions, which were 
lower than in the previous month, and taking 
account of changes in issuers’ holdings of their 
own debt securities, the outstanding volume of 
domestic bonds grew by €19.5 billion. Foreign 
debt securities worth €16.3 billion net were 
placed in the German market. The outstanding 
volume of debt securities in Germany therefore 
rose by €35.8 billion on balance.
In the month under review, the public sector 
increased its bond market liabilities by €18.7 
billion net, compared with €19.9 billion in Janu -
ary. Central government issued primarily ten-  
year bonds (€7.3 billion), two- year Federal 
Treasury notes (Schätze) totalling €6.1 billion 
and Treasury discount paper (Bubills) worth 
€5.3 billion. State and local governments is -
sued securities with a net value of €1.4 billion.
In February, credit institutions issued debt se -
curities worth €3.4 billion net, compared with 
€4.0 billion one month earlier. This was ultim -
ately entirely attributable to other bank debt 
securities (€5.0 billion). The outstanding vol -
ume of mortgage Pfandbriefe and debt secur -
ities issued by specialised credit institutions, by 
contrast, decreased (-€0.9 billion and -€0.5 bil -
lion respectively).
Domestic enterprises reduced their capital mar -
ket debt by €2.6 billion in February, following 
net issuance of €3.6 billion in the previous 
month. These redemptions were attributable

securities on balance. The Bundesbank in -
creased its securities holdings by €20.4 billion, 
mainly under the Eurosystem’s asset purchase 
programmes. By contrast, domestic credit insti -
tutions and foreign investors offloaded bonds 
(-€3.7 billion and -€3.4 billion net respectively).
Equity market
In the month under review, new shares worth 
€2.7 billion were issued in the German equity 
market. The outstanding volume of foreign 
shares in the German market increased by €6.2 
billion. Domestic non- banks were the main 
buyers of shares in February (€9.3 billion). Do -
mestic credit institutions added €1.5 billion net 
to their equity holdings, while foreign investors 
reduced their equity exposure in Germany by 
€1.9 billion on balance.
Mutual funds
In February, the inflows recorded by domestic 
mutual funds were smaller than in the previous 
month (€7.3 billion compared with €12.2 bil -
lion). The fresh funds benefited predominantly 
specialised funds reserved for institutional in -
vestors (€4.4 billion). Among the asset classes, 
mixed securities- based funds attracted the 
most inflows (€4.2 billion), followed by open-  
end real estate funds (€1.9 billion), equity funds 
(€1.8 billion) and funds of funds (€1.3 billion). 
Bond- based funds, on the other hand, re -
corded outflows of funds (-€3.1 billion). For -
eign mutual funds placed shares worth €6.9 
billion in the German market in February. Ger -
man non- banks were almost the sole net 
buyers of investment fund shares (€13.5 bil -
lion). In net terms, domestic credit institutions 
acquired shares for €1.4 billion, while foreign 
investors sold €0.7 billion worth of German 
mutual fund shares.Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur -
plus of €18.8 billion in February 2021, up €1.1 
billion from the previous month’s level. While 
the surplus in invisible current transactions, 
which comprise services as well as primary and 
secondary income, saw a decline, the surplus in 
the goods account rose more strongly.
In February, the surplus in the goods account 
increased by €4.3 billion on the month to €18.6 
billion, with exports of goods expanding more 
sharply than imports.
In February, the surplus in invisible current 
transactions fell by €3.2 billion to €0.2 billion. 
This was primarily because net receipts in pri -
mary income decreased by €2.1 billion to €7.7 
billion, which was largely attributable to higher 
dividend payments to non- residents for port -
folio investment. Furthermore, the deficit in the Net issuance in

secondary income account widened by €1.4 
billion to €8.8 billion, a development which 
was contributed to by higher general govern -

In February 2021, the US economy’s increas -

drop that Germany’s cross- border portfolio in -

billion (after €11.5 billion in January). Domestic 
investors added €29.7 billion worth of secur -

They purchased bonds (€15.3 billion), mutual 
fund shares (€6.9 billion), shares (€6.5 billion)

(€1.9 billion) and mutual fund shares (€0.7 bil -

€7.8 billion in February (January: €5.9 billion).
Direct investment generated net capital exports 
of €4.9 billion in February, up from €2.6 billion 
in January. Domestic enterprises increased their

invested earnings playing a key role here. In 
addition, they granted, on balance, €0.8 billion 
in loans to affiliated enterprises abroad. Foreign 
direct investment stocks in Germany rose by

The impact of monetary policy depending 
on the debt situation in the non- financial 
private sector: Evidence for the euro area
The economic restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic have caused the debt situation in the 
euro area’s non-  financial private sector to deteriorate. This is reflected primarily in rising debt 
among non- financial corporations and households in relation to gross domestic product. The 
economic literature shows that higher debt in the non- financial private sector can amplify the 
impact of monetary policy measures. To date, however, hardly any empirical studies on this sub -
ject have focused on the euro area.
This article aims to reduce that gap in the literature. Using an econometric analysis based on a 
panel of the euro area countries, estimates are carried out for high- debt and low- debt regimes. 
The results show that non- financial corporations and households adjust their expenditure to a 
noticeably greater extent in response to a monetary policy shock in a high- debt regime than in a 
low- debt regime. These differences are more pronounced for non- financial corporations than for 
households.
At the current end of the data, most of the debt indicators for non- financial corporations and 
households in the euro area countries do not point to exceptionally high debt despite the less 
favourable situation resulting from the pandemic. This means that the current debt situation does 
not constitute a high- debt regime and is therefore unlikely to contribute to any significant ampli -
fication of the impact of monetary policy measures.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
The economic restrictions due to the corona -
virus pandemic have worsened the debt situ -
ation of the non- financial private sector in the 
euro area and its member countries. Income 
has fallen and borrowing has risen – in the case 
of non- financial corporations, significantly. The 
combined debt of non- financial corporations 
and households has increased perceptibly in re -
lation to income.
In view of these circumstances, this article in -
vestigates whether the debt situation in the 
non- financial private sector alters the transmis -
sion of monetary policy. Theoretical and econo -
metric studies indicate that high debt in rela -
tion to income, wealth or liquid assets is asso -
ciated with a greater marginal propensity to 
spend among non- financial corporations and 
households. One reason cited for this, amongst 
others, is that balance sheet constraints caused 
by high debt prevent non- financial corpor -
ations and households from implementing their 
optimum investment and consumption plans. 
Income changes triggered by monetary policy 
measures consequently have a stronger impact 
on investment and consumption than they 
would in an environment without such balance 
sheet constraints.
For quite some time, there has been awareness 
of and research into the fundamental import -
ance of balance sheet positions for the trans -
mission of monetary policy (the “balance sheet 
channel”). This literature concentrates on the 
borrowing capacity of non- financial corpor -
ations and households. Recently, this focus has 
been expanded to include further balance 
sheet influences, such as liquidity position and 
debt service capacity. This broader perspective 
on balance sheet constraints, of which the 
traditional balance sheet channel is one com -
ponent, is the subject of analysis in this article. 
It centres on the question of whether monetary 
policy measures have a stronger impact when 
balance sheet constraints play a larger role.While the existing empirical studies on this sub -
ject mostly look at the United States, this article 
turns the focus onto the euro area countries. In 
the following, the article first elaborates on the 
conceptual foundations for the impact of mon -
etary policy measures being dependent on the 
debt situation of the non- financial private sec -
tor and outlines the results of the existing lit -
erature. Then, it presents and discusses econo -
metric estimates for a panel of euro area coun -
tries. Finally, based on these estimates, the art -
icle evaluates whether the current debt 
situation in the euro area may tend to amplify 
the impact of monetary policy impulses.
Conceptual foundations and 
existing empirical evidence
The state- dependent effects of monetary policy 
have been the subject of investigation in the 
academic literature for some time now.1 When 
monetary policy is described as having “state-  
dependent effects”, this means that its efficacy 
depends on whether it is expansionary or con -
tractionary as well as on external influences. 
For example, academic studies show that a 
tightening of monetary policy has a greater im -
pact than an equivalent degree of monetary 
policy easing.2 In addition, monetary policy 
measures have a weaker impact during reces -
sions than during economic booms.3
In the wake of the global financial and eco -
nomic crisis, there was an increased focus on 
the balance sheet situations among non-  
financial corporations and households as a pos -
sible cause of monetary policy having an im -Debt situation of

1 Previously, most theoretical and empirical models of 
monetary policy transmission were based on the assump -
tion that the impact of monetary policy was always quali -

independent. For a detailed overview of this literature, see 
Ramey (2016).

(1999). Newer studies such as Angrist et al. (2018) also 
confirm this result.

authors describe their results with the metaphor “pushing 
on a string”. They also confirm that contractionary shocks 
have stronger effects than expansionary shocks.Deutsche Bundesbank

pact that is state- dependent. The fundamental 
idea is that non- financial corporations and 
households cannot adjust their investment and 
consumption decisions completely independ -
ently of the prevailing economic circumstances. 
For example, in times of economic difficulty, 
non- financial corporations and households 
with balance sheet constraints are likely to be 
unable to compensate for all of the temporary 
income losses triggered by contractionary mon -
etary policy measures by increasing their bor -
rowing. Consequently, they restrict their ex -
penditure more than non- financial corporations 
and households without balance sheet con -
straints.
Balance sheet constraints influence monetary 
policy transmission via direct and indirect in -
come effects in particular. Direct income effects 
are direct changes in interest expenditure, inter -
est income and other investment income. Mon -
etary policy measures are likely to generate 
interest income effects primarily among house -
holds and non- financial corporations whose 
balance sheets include large credit liabilities 
with variable interest rates.4 For example, if 
monetary policymakers raise interest rates dur -
ing an economic upswing in order to dampen 
inflation, this interest rate hike has a direct im -
pact on the net income of these non-  financial 
corporations and households. Conversely, in an 
economic downturn, their finances benefit dir -
ectly from falling short-  term interest rates. In 
addition, indirect income effects triggered by 
monetary policy also play a role, primarily via 
changes on the labour market. Individuals with 
low incomes typically face a higher risk of un -
employment. Furthermore, these households 
often face balance sheet constraints because it 
is more difficult for them to take out loans than 
those with higher incomes and lower risks of 
unemployment. Consequently, they do not bor -
row funds to compensate for income losses 
triggered by monetary policy, and monetary 
policy has a stronger impact.5
One important balance sheet constraint affect -
ing loan availability is the existence of loan- to- value ratios. The analysis of these ratios is piv -
otal to the traditional balance sheet channel of 
monetary policy transmission,6 according to 
which the availability of loans is mostly con -
strained by the value of collateral (particularly 
real estate) and the amount of (disposable) in -
come in relation to debt. If debt in relation to 
this is high and net wealth (assets less liabilities) 
is thus low, this can give rise to balance sheet 
constraints that prevent further borrowing. 
Monetary policy influences these balance sheet 
constraints, in particular, via its impact on asset 
prices and income. When expansionary monet -
ary policy measures are taken, rising income 
and asset prices lead to an easing of balance 
sheet constraints and make additional borrow -
ing possible. By contrast, contractionary 
changes in the monetary policy stance increase 
balance sheet constraints. In both cases, this 
amplifies the impact of monetary policy meas -
ures.7
One extreme case of balance sheet constraints 
is excessive indebtedness, which prevents fur -
ther borrowing. In order to ensure long- term 
sustainability of the debt, borrowers must first 
refrain from further borrowing or repay their 
debt. Second, lenders could prevent further 
borrowing in spite of rising income and asset 
prices. The effects of expansionary monetary 
policy measures are thus weaker than those of 
contractionary monetary policy measures.8 In 
line with this, the finance and growth literature 
shows that high levels of debt have a negative 
impact on long- term growth (see also the box 
on p. 18).
Another important balance sheet factor for the 
degree of monetary policy transmission is the

The impact of debt on long- term economic growth
The main text has thus far focused on the 
state- dependent effects of the debt situ-
ation on the effectiveness of monetary pol-
icy. The fi  nance and growth literature exam-
ines whether the level of debt also has an 
impact on long- term equilibrium growth. 
Specifi  cally, it analyses how fi  nancial devel-
opment affects growth in real gross domes-
tic product (GDP) per capita. The debt ratio, 
which is also frequently used in the litera-
ture on the state- dependent effects of 
monetary policy, usually serves as a meas-
ure of fi  nancial development.
One of the fi  rst systematic studies in this 
body of literature was performed by Gold-
smith at the end of the 1960s.1 According 
to his results, bank assets (as a proxy for 
debt in the non- fi  nancial private sector) 
relative to GDP correlate positively with 
economic growth. In the 1990s and 2000s, 
a number of researchers revisited this sub-
ject using econometric methods. The key 
fi  nding of these works, too, was that a 
large fi  nancing volume has a positive effect 
on growth.2However, in light of the global fi  nancial and 
economic crisis, the relationship between 
fi  nan cing and economic growth has been 
reevaluated from a variety of angles. In this 
context, various authors have shown that 
debt has a state- dependent effect on long- 
term growth. More precisely, they fi  nd that 
the relationship between the bank loan li-
abilities of the non- fi  nancial private sector 
as a percentage of GDP and economic 
growth is non- linear and exhibits an in-
verted u- shape.3 Starting from a low level, a 
rising debt ratio initially has a positive effect 
on growth up to a saturation point, with 
subsequent increases in the debt ratio being 
accompanied by lower growth.
Our own econometric estimates for a panel 
of 34 advanced economies indicate that, at 
the sectoral level, an inverted u- shaped re-
lationship can only be found for the house-
hold sector.4 Its debt thus has a state- 
dependent effect on long- term growth. By 
contrast, no signifi  cant effect on growth 
can be found for the debt levels of non- 
fi  nancial corporations. The chart below 
shows the non- linear relationship for house-
holds. Here, a rise in the debt ratio up to a 
level of just under 40% goes hand in hand 
with perceptibly higher economic growth. 
Above this level, the relationship turns 
negative, though the decline in economic 
growth is comparatively weak. At the cur-
rent end of the data, the debt ratio in the 
euro area and Germany exceeds this thresh-
old, at just over 62% and 58% respectively.

transferable deposits. The empirical literature 
shows that “hand- to- mouth” consumers typic -
ally have a high marginal propensity to con -
sume.9 This is because they hold only small 
amounts of liquid funds. Consequently, a de -
cline in income triggered by monetary policy, 
for example, cannot be so easily mitigated by 
using up liquidity buffers. The effects of con -
tractionary monetary policy are thus ultimately 
reinforced. Through the generally high mar -
ginal propensity to consume exhibited by these 
constrained households, income growth result -
ing from expansionary monetary policy meas -
ures likewise has a greater impact on real eco -
nomic developments.10 The reason for the 
stronger impact is that the previously binding 
balance sheet constraints meant that house -
holds were unable to consume as much as ac -
tually envisaged in their optimal consumption 
plans.11 Income gains are therefore used rela -
tively extensively for additional private con -
sumption.
A number of empirical analyses based on 
micro data find evidence that monetary policy 
measures have a stronger impact if balance 
sheet constraints bind. Findings in the United 
Kingdom, for example, show that monetary 
policy is especially potent when a large share of 
households are financially constrained by high 
debt ratios.12 Similarly, an empirical study for 
the United Kingdom and the United States indi -
cates that, in aggregate terms, the response of 
consumption to monetary policy shocks is 
driven by households with mortgage debt. 
These households possess significant net 
wealth in the form of real estate. However, due 
to the fact that they often hold only small 
amounts of liquid assets, they can cushion tem -
porary income fluctuations to just a limited ex -
tent, and changes in income triggered by mon -
etary policy thus have a correspondingly strong 
impact.13 Moreover, in the case of Sweden, it is 
apparent that indebted households exhibit 
more significant responses to monetary policy 
shocks than debt- free households. This effect is 
particularly pronounced in the case of house -
holds with variable- rate mortgages.14 Finally, less mature non- financial corporations in the 
United Kingdom and the United States make 
greater adjustments to their investments in re -
sponse to monetary policy shocks than more 
mature corporations. According to the study, 
this is mainly attributable to the fact that less 
mature non- financial corporations have lower 
net worth and this limits their capacity to bor -
row.15
In addition to these microeconometric ana -
lyses, a wide variety of macroeconometric stud -
ies also investigate whether the effect of mon -
etary policy changes if sectoral debt indicators 
are at certain levels. For instance, a recent an -
alysis finds that monetary policy shocks in the 
United States only have a significant impact on 
real economic activity if households’ net wealth 
is low and, in turn, their borrowing capacity 
limited. By contrast, during phases of high net 
wealth – i.e. if balance sheet constraints are 
non- binding – this study ascertains only minor 
and also mostly insignificant effects.16 In add -
ition, a study based on a number of advanced 
economies concluded that household con -
sumption and investment in residential prop -
erty respond more strongly to monetary policy 
shocks in phases of high debt ratios than in 
periods of low debt.17 Furthermore, in the 
United States, monetary policy shocks have a 
larger impact in times of high loan- to- value 
ratios (LTVs) than in periods of low LTVs, as 
households make greater adjustments to their 
real estate- backed consumer loans.18
All in all, the existing empirical literature thus 
reinforces the theoretical approach of attribut -
ing a greater impact to monetary policy shocks 
every time economic agents’ spending deci -
sions are limited by balance sheet constraints. Low availability 
of liquid assets 
can also consti -
tute a balance

This is mainly the case in situations where debt 
and the associated interest and principal pay -
ments are high in relation to income, wealth or 
liquid assets. In this context, it may be assumed 
that contractionary shocks also tend to have a 
more potent effect than expansionary monet -
ary policy interventions if there are balance 
sheet constraints.
How the impact of monetary 
policy measures depends on 
the debt situation in the 
euro area
As a complement to the existing evidence, this 
article will now investigate whether balance 
sheet constraints in the private non- financial 
sector are linked to changes in the impact of 
monetary policy in the euro area as well. The 
analysis is based on a panel of euro area coun -
tries. It quantifies how key macroeconomic in -
dicators react to a monetary policy shock de -
pending on the balance sheet conditions. In -
vestment among non-  financial corporations 
and consumption among households are used 
as dependent variables. For both sectors, the 
estimates distinguish between two states: bal -
ance sheet constraints are highly likely in a 
high- debt regime and unlikely in a low- debt re -
gime. These estimates examine the effect of 
balance sheet constraints in isolation and are 
therefore based on the implicit assumption that 
expansionary and contractionary shocks have 
symmetrical impacts.19
Information about the balance sheet state is 
derived on the basis of the conceptual consid -
erations outlined above and, in line with the 
empirical literature, using the levels of various 
debt indicators. These indicators can be ob -
tained using data from the financial accounts 
and national accounts. Separate calculations 
are carried out for both the non- financial cor -
poration and household sectors for each of the 
individual euro area countries. It should be 
noted that this analysis discusses the average 
effects for the respective sector in a given country and cannot show differing reactions 
between individual households or corporations.
In the empirical literature, the debt ratio has 
emerged as the key indicator for determining 
balance sheet constraints. It puts debt in rela -
tion to gross domestic product (GDP).20 For 
non- financial corporations, debt is calculated 
as the sum of loans, debt securities, pension 
provisions as well as trade credits and ad -
vances. For households, it is limited to loans. 
The chart on p. 21 shows the development of 
the sectoral debt ratios in the euro area as a 
whole. To illustrate the margin of fluctuation 
between the euro area countries examined, the 
range between the 25th and 75th percentiles 
of the country distribution is additionally 
shown.
The debt ratios of both sectors initially saw 
steep rises in the 2000s. They then moved side -
ways for non-  financial corporations following 
the onset of the global financial and economic 
crisis, while households’ debt ratios were on a 
slight downward path. However, these devel -
opments at the euro area level conceal differ -
ent trends in the individual countries.21 The pri -
vate non- financial sectors in Spain and Portu -
gal, for example, reduced their debt ratios sig -
nificantly, while the upward trend continued in 
France. The sharp rise over the course of 2020 
is largely due to the considerable slump in eco -
nomic activity as a result of the coronavirus Analysis of

20 In principle, debt could also be put in relation to sec -
toral income, with the latter reflecting a sector’s income 
situation more closely. GDP is used here, however, to im -
prove comparability with existing studies. As data on the 
non- financial assets of households and non-  financial cor -
porations are often unavailable, the empirical literature 
mainly uses the debt ratio (debt in relation to income) ra -
ther than the leverage ratio (debt in relation to total assets). 
At the macroeconomic level, the leverage ratio would cor -
respond to the mortgage lending value discussed in theor -
etical studies (real estate loan relative to real estate assets) 
at the microeconomic level.

pandemic.22 Furthermore, debt among non-  
financial corporations was up significantly.
The debt ratio only takes constraints on the 
liabil ities side into consideration. However, as 
explained above, low holdings of liquid assets 
can also represent a constraint and likewise 
lead to monetary policy having a state-  
dependent impact. This is taken into account 
by the debt coverage ratio, which shows debt 
in relation to liquid financial assets, measured 
here as currency and deposits. The above chart 
illustrates the development of this ratio. This in -
dicator has fallen in both parts of the non-  
financial private sector since the global finan-cial and economic crisis, driven in particular by 
a rise in liquid assets. The renewed acceleration 
in the decline since the outbreak of the corona -
virus pandemic, especially among non- financial 
corporations, is likely to be attributable in part 
to the copious liquidity assistance from the 
public sector.

balance sheet constraints. It shows interest and High level of

cant influence on interest rates and thereby a 
knock- on effect on interest expenditure.23 The 
chart on p. 21 shows developments in the debt 
service ratios.24 Particularly for households, it 
has been falling continuously since 2008, 
mainly due to lower interest payments. For 
non- financial corporations, it has been moving 
sideways with some fluctuation since the global 
financial and economic crisis. Taken in isol -
ation, the falling interest rate level provided re -
lief in this regard, but growing debt levels 
counteracted this development. With the onset 
of the coronavirus crisis, the debt service ratio 
among non- financial corporations rose percep -
tibly on the back of the sharp fall in sectoral in -
come.
For the indicators described above, it is possible 
to derive thresholds that can be used to esti -
mate the state- dependent impact of a monet -
ary policy shock.25 If the value of an indicator 
exceeds the threshold, a sector is in a high-  
debt regime. Values below the threshold indi -
cate that the sector is in a low- debt regime. 
The individual euro area countries are subdiv -
ided by sector into non- financial corporations 
and households. Specifically, the thresholds are 
determined based on a specific percentile 
chosen to maximise the explanatory power of 
the panel estimation methods used for this an -

variables.26 The sectoral percentile calculated in 
this manner for the panel dataset as a whole is 
then individually applied to each country, gen -
erating country- specific thresholds for the three 
indicators. This addresses, in particular, struc -
tural differences between the individual coun -
tries in the level of the indicators, while at the 
same time assuring that a certain margin of dis -
tribution is identified as a high- debt regime 
across countries.27 The threshold for the house -
hold debt ratio for each of the countries in this 
sample is set, for instance, at the 76th percent -
ile.
The chart on p. 22 shows the distribution of 
the country- specific thresholds that categorise 
a country’s non- financial corporations and 
households as being in a high- debt or low- debt 
state. It shows that, for the debt ratio among 
households, most of the thresholds are located 
around the 65% mark. For non- financial cor -
porations, the median threshold is around 
97%. The country- specific thresholds for the debt service ratio and the debt coverage ratio 
are considerably higher for non- financial cor -
porations than for households. In the case of 
the debt service ratio, this is due, in particular, 
to non- financial corporations’ lower sectoral in -
come. As regards the debt coverage ratio, the 
small stocks of liquid assets by sectoral stand -
ards are the reason for the higher thresholds.

26 The threshold values are calculated largely following 
Cecchetti et al. (2011). The authors look at the non- linear 
relationship between long- term growth and debt, and, in 
this context, determine a critical value which is identical for 
all observed countries. Debt in excess of this threshold is 
associated with lower growth. When determining the 
threshold, the authors ensure that it minimises the sum of 
squared residuals of the underlying estimated model. By 
contrast, in this analysis, the thresholds are determined 
specifically for each country in order to address structural 
differences between the individual countries. In addition, a 
constraint is imposed: that the calculated thresholds are 
consistent with the state-  dependent responses docu -
mented in the literature.

sible to estimate country- specific percentiles.Deutsche Bundesbank

Empirical approach to quantifying state-dependent effects 
of monetary policy shocks on real economic indicators
Measuring the causal infl  uence of monetary 
policy on macroeconomic indicators such as 
investment and consumption requires identifi  -
cation of exogenous changes in the monetary 
policy stance. These are defi  ned as changes 
that were not expected by market partici-
pants, referred to as monetary policy shocks, 
and are distinct from changes in the monetary 
policy stance in response to past, present or 
expected developments. Only in the fi  rst case 
can the impact of monetary policy measures 
on macroeconomic indicators be disentangled 
from other infl  uencing factors. In the second 
case, the cause would instead lie in the chan-
ging economic setting, to which monetary 
policy systematically responds within the 
framework of its monetary policy reaction 
function.
Monetary policy shocks are identifi  ed using 
high- frequency fi  nancial market data.1 This in-
volves measuring changes in market rates sur-
rounding what is known as an event win-
dow.2 Specifi  cally, this analysis looks at the 
period from shortly before publication of the 
press release on monetary policy decisions to 
just after the press conference following the 
meetings of the ECB Governing Council. This 
is in line with the approach taken by Altavilla 
et al. (2019). The identifi  cation assumption is 
that all interest rate changes occurring within 
this selected event window are attributable to 
unexpected announcements of monetary pol-
icy measures. These interest rate changes are 
then used as external instruments in an 
econometric estimation in order to identify 
the changes in the monetary policy stance re-
sulting from an exogenous monetary policy 
shock. The shadow short rate of Geiger and 
Schupp (2018) serves as a composite indicator 
of the monetary policy stance. Since the 
shadow rate combines information on short- 
term and long- term interest rate movements, 
it responds to both standard and non- 
standard monetary policy measures, provided 
these are refl  ected in the yield curve. This 
allows for account to be taken of the fact that the non- standard monetary policy measures 
implemented in recent years impacted the 
long end of the yield curve in particular.
In concrete terms, the infl  uence of monetary 
policy on real economic indicators is esti-
mated using local projections as propounded 
by Jordà (2005) with instrumental variables 
(LP- IV) for a panel dataset.3 In the fi  rst step, 
the shadow rate is regressed on the previously 
identifi  ed monetary policy shocks.4 The esti-
mation results are then used to calculate pre-
dicted values for the shadow rate.5 These pre-
dictions depict the changes in the shadow 
rate that can be ascribed purely to monetary 
policy shocks. The second step uses these pre-
dictions to construct what are known as local 
projections for the real economic indicators. 
This involves estimating a series of equations 
in which the macroeconomic indicator is re-
gressed on the estimated shadow rate val-
ues.6 These equations are estimated for differ-
ent lags of the shadow rate in comparison 
with the dependent variables. The function of 
the shadow rate’s regression coeffi   cients for

(2015).
2 The reference dataset for this is the Euro Area Mon-
etary Policy Event- Study Database. For more informa-
tion, see Altavilla et al. (2019).
3 For more information on local projections with in-
strumental variables (LP- IV) for panel data, see, for ex-
ample, Jordà et al. (2015, 2019).
4 The shock time series is identifi  ed analogously to the 
split- sample method of Swanson (2021). Up to the end 
of 2012, unexpected changes in the one- year OIS rate 
around the time of monetary policy meetings are de-
fi  ned as monetary policy shocks. From 2013 onwards, 
however, reference is made to unexpected changes in 
the ten- year OIS rate. This accounts for the non- 
standard monetary policy measures, which affect the 
long end of the yield curve in particular. For a similar 
approach, see, for example, Tillmann (2020). The inter-
est rate changes are drawn from the database of Al-
tavilla et al. (2019).
5 The F- statistics of the estimations in the fi  rst step are 
each above their respective critical values. The null hy-
pothesis of weak instruments can thus be rejected.

each lag estimated in this way then corres-
ponds to the response of the macroeconomic 
indicator to the monetary policy shock over 
the response horizon in question. It can be in-
terpreted as the impulse- response function of 
the dependent variable to the monetary policy 
shock. Separate estimations are carried out 
for non- fi  nancial corporations and house-
holds. Combined, this results in the following 
estimation equations:
1. First regression step: Estimation of instru-
mental variables
ssrt = µ + φinstt + ω(L)xi,t + ηt.
Here, ssr is the shadow short rate, µ is a 
constant, inst is the high- frequency 
change in the market rate interpreted as 
a response to the exogenous monetary 
policy shock, x  is a vector with control 
variables,7 and η is an error term. In add-
ition, i represents a country index and t 
represents a time index. This estimation 
equation is used to generate predicted 
values for cssr, which are then input into 
the estimation equations of the second 
regression step.

ary policy on investment and consump-
tion without taking account of the bal-
ance sheet state8

Here, y is the macroeconomic indicator 
–  investment for non- fi  nancial corpor-
ations or consumption for households – 
α is a country- specifi  c constant, cssr is the 
predicted value for the shadow rate from 
the fi  rst regression step, x  is the vector 
with control variables used previously, ε is 
an error term, i is the country index and t 
is the time index. The variable h can take 
a value of between 0 and 16. The esti-
mated parameter βh is the cumulative 
change at time t+h. This yields a local 
projection spanning a period of 16 quar-
ters. As, by construction, the error terms can be auto correlated, Driscoll- Kraay 
standard errors are used. The estimation 
period extends from the beginning of 
1999 to the end of 2019. The period 
since the outbreak of the coronavirus 
pandemic is thus excluded in order to 
avoid biasing the estimations. The shock 
is normalised to an unexpected reduction 
in the shadow rate of 100 basis points. In 
order obtain state- dependent impulse re-
sponses, the second- step equation is also 
estimated as follows:
2.b Second regression step: Impact of monet-
ary policy on investment and consump-
tion taking account of the balance sheet

Here, Ii,t-1 denotes the balance sheet 
state of non- fi  nancial corporations or 
households prior to the monetary policy 
shock. The indicator takes a value of one 
if the debt indicators of non- fi  nancial cor-
porations or households in country i  are 
above the threshold and a value of zero if 
they are below the threshold. The esti-
mated parameters βB,h and βU,h thus de-
pict, respectively, the response of a sector 
experiencing balance sheet constraints 
and a sector not experiencing balance 
sheet constraints at time h. As explained 
in the main text, non- fi  nancial corpor-
ations and households are categorised as 
balance sheet constrained or balance 
sheet unconstrained on the basis of the 
three debt indicators.
7 Specifi  cally, the following control variables are in-
cluded: real GDP growth, infl  ation rate, growth in real 
house prices, and lagged values of the dependent vari-
ables. The lag length is q = 1.
8 So that the estimation uncertainty of the fi  rst step is 
accounted for in the second step, the sum of the 
squared errors is automatically corrected accordingly.

identify asymmetrical effects, see, for example, Auer-

or households were in a high- debt regime at a 
given point in time. It shows that, especially in 
the period bookending the global financial and 
economic crisis, non- financial corporations and 
households were in a high- debt regime in a 
considerably larger number of countries. While 
the low interest rate environment has prevailed 
for several years now, the debt situation has 
eased perceptibly again, especially among 
households.
The thresholds can be employed to show the 
state dependence of the impact of a monetary 
policy shock on the basis of impulse responses, 
which are calculated in a panel context using 
local projections.28 The impulse responses 
show how household consumption and non-  
financial corporations’ investment respond to 
an expansionary monetary policy shock, de -
pending on the debt regime. The magnitude of 
the monetary policy shock is normalised to a 
decline in the shadow short rate of 100 basis 
points.29 For purposes of comparison, the re -sponses are also shown without differentiation 
by debt regime. The models were estimated 
separately for each of the two sectors and 
three debt indicators. The box on pp. 24 f. pro -
vides a detailed description of the econometric 
approach used. The adjacent chart presents the 
results of the estimations. To provide a clearer 
overview, the chart shows the average effects 
over 12 quarters instead of the full impulse re -
sponses.
The baseline model does not make a distinction 
between the high- debt and low- debt states 
and produces the expected results: non-  
financial corporations and households respond 
to an expansionary monetary policy shock by 
increasing, respectively, their investment and 
consumption. Conditional on the debt regime, 
the results vary perceptibly: in a high- debt 
environ ment, non- financial corporations and 
households increase their spending to a consid -
erably stronger degree in response to an ex -
pansionary monetary policy shock than in a 
low- debt regime.30 These differences are sig -
nificantly more pronounced for non- financial 
corporations than for households.
The effects among households are quite similar 
across all three indicators. As regards non-  
financial corporations, the response of invest -
ment depends particularly heavily on whether 
the debt coverage ratio is high or not. This sug -
gests that short- term liquidity bottlenecks, in 
particular, could represent a balance sheet con -
straint for non- financial corporations. To sum

Conclusions and outlook
As a result of the economic restrictions due to 
the coronavirus pandemic, the debt situation in 
the non- financial private sector in the euro area 
as a whole and its individual member countries 
has seen a trend deterioration. This is reflected, 
above all, in a rise in the debt- to- income ratio 
among non- financial corporations and house -
holds. Against this backdrop, this article investi -
gated whether the debt situation in the non-  
financial private sector could potentially affect 
the transmission of monetary policy. It found 
that monetary policy shocks always have a rela -
tively strong impact in those cases where non-  
financial corporations or households are highly 
indebted. This result holds irrespective of which 
of the three debt indicators used here is applied.This article concludes by seeking to establish, 
based on the estimation results presented 
above, the extent to which the current debt 
situation could potentially impact the effective -
ness of monetary policy in the euro area as 
things now stand. To this end, the above chart 
presents the deviations of the current values of 
the three debt indicators from the respective 
thresholds for the individual euro area coun -
tries. Observations above the horizontal zero 
axis indicate that non- financial corporations are 
highly indebted. Similarly, values to the right of 
the vertical zero axis indicate that households 
are highly indebted.
For non- financial corporations, the debt ratio 
indicates a high- debt regime in all countries. By 
contrast, the debt service ratio points to a high- 
debt regime only in around one-half of all cases 
and the debt coverage ratio in only one case. 
One reason for the discrepancy between the 
indicators is that non-  financial corporations 
(collectively) have relatively large liquidity buf -Impact of

fers. Another is that the low level of interest 
rates, in and of itself, has provided relief with 
regard to debt service. For households, the ma -
jority of the indicator levels do not appear to 
suggest high- debt regimes as defined in the 
empirical analysis explained above. This is espe -
cially true of the debt coverage ratio.
All in all, it thus cannot be ruled out that, at the 
current end, the debt situation is amplifying the impact of monetary policy shocks in a small 
number of countries and sectors. However, 
despite the pandemic-  induced deterioration in 
the debt situation, widespread balance sheet 
constraints which could amplify the impact of 
monetary policy are currently nowhere to be 
seen. At present, the debt situation is therefore 
not set to contribute to any significant amplifi -
cation of the impact of monetary policy meas -
ures.Debt situation

Assessments and expectations of 
firms in the pandemic: findings from 
the Bundesbank Online Panel Firms
Short- term information on the current situation of firms in Germany is very valuable to economic 
and monetary policymakers. Particularly in the coronavirus pandemic, during which the environ -
ment is changing rapidly, it allows the economic consequences of the pandemic and the impact 
of the measures taken to contain it to be assessed and evaluated in a timely and reliable man -
ner. The Bundesbank therefore used its new survey of firms to obtain relevant assessments from 
the enterprises’ perspective. This article presents the Bundesbank Online Panel Firms, which aims 
to improve the general information base on assessments and expectations in the German busi -
ness sector. It also discusses key findings from the first surveys with regard to the economic con -
sequences of the pandemic.
The first four waves of the survey of firms show that a large proportion of firms across sectors 
have reported decreases in production or business activity. In December 2020, the average 
decrease in firms’ activity (relative to the same month of the previous year) stood at almost one- 
fifth, although there are major differences depending on the sector. In addition, the collection of 
data on key enterprise metrics shows that the pandemic- induced effects have exhibited a wave- 
like development since the onset of the crisis. Whilst almost two- thirds of the surveyed firms 
reported falling turnover for the May-  June 2020 period, this share decreased over the summer 
months to two- fifths in September- October 2020, before rising again to roughly one- half at the 
turn of the year in December-  January. Finally, it was revealed that the coronavirus pandemic has 
also had an impact on the financial situation of firms and given rise to a temporary increase in 
the demand for credit.
Furthermore, the survey asked about firms’ inflation expectations in autumn 2020. Over a horizon 
of one year, firms did not expect a rising inflation rate relative to the estimated inflation rate of 
the preceding 12 months. This suggests that enterprises’ inflation expectations were firmly 
anchored, despite the economic slump. Moreover, collecting data on firms’ and households’ 
inflation expectations in parallel online surveys by the Bundesbank permits a direct comparison: 
firms expect lower inflation – in terms of both the realised and the expected inflation rate – than 
households.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
The coronavirus pandemic and the measures 
taken to contain it led to an abrupt and severe 
slump in Germany’s economic activity in the 
spring of 2020, which was unprecedented in 
post- war history. In this exceptional situation, a 
major need arose for the most up- to- date and 
detailed information possible on the economic 
situation of enterprises in Germany. The Bun -
desbank therefore initiated its own survey of 
firms – the design of which was largely com -
pleted in spring 2020 – in order to obtain timely 
information, in particular, on the effects of the 
pandemic on general economic activity, on 
firms’ financing situation and on future expect -
ations in the business sector. The first wave of 
this internet- based pilot survey was conducted 
in June and July 2020.1
There are three main reasons in favour of the 
Bundesbank conducting the survey of firms in -
dependently. First, the survey content, periods 
and survey intervals can be tailored directly to 
the Bundesbank’s own needs, allowing the sur -
vey to be structured in as data- minimising and 
targeted a manner as possible for participating 
firms. Second, the anonymised microdata from 
the survey can be used swiftly and comprehen -
sively for analyses and research within the Bun -
desbank, allowing differences between firms to 
be discovered and making their possible effects 
on monetary policy and financial stability iden -
tifiable. Lastly, the anonymised linking2 of sur -
vey data with other Bundesbank datasets at 
the micro level opens up potential for synergies 
and provides valuable insights on sector-  
specific or regional phenomena and their sig -
nificance for macroeconomic developments in 
Germany.
The objective of the survey of firms is to better 
depict the current situation of enterprises and 
their assessments and expectations in the cur -
rent economic policy environment. For ex -
ample, firms, through their decisions, have a 
major impact on the development of prices, 
the stability of which is the core objective of the Eurosystem. In order to be able to gain a 
better understanding of enterprises and their 
behaviour, firms were asked about their infla -
tion expectations in a degree of detail which 
was unprecedented for enterprises in Germany 
(see the table on p. 50). However, other ques -
tions – for example, on the past and expected 
development of key enterprise metrics, such as 
turnover or employment – also deliver indirect 
insights into inflation developments, as these 
expectations can have an impact on enter -
prises’ own price setting. To complete the pic -
ture, firms are asked to name problem areas 
and assess how challenging each of these are. 
Examples include the competitive situation, the 
availability of skilled staff and the scale of gov -
ernment influence and regulation. Finally, par -
ticular importance is also attached to firms’ 
financing  situation and access to credit in order 
to be able to answer questions relating to fi -
nancial stability.
This article provides information on the survey’s 
methodology and presents selected findings 
from the first four survey waves, which were 
conducted between June 2020 and February 
2021.3 First, it presents findings on the situation 
of firms in the coronavirus pandemic, particu -
larly highlighting its effects on the economic 
situation and the development of economic ex -
pectations. Second, it reports on findings relat -
ing to firms’ financing situation, with particular 
emphasis on the development of financing 
needs, access to bank loans and the use of pub -
lic support measures. Third, a closer look is taken Pandemic- 
induced increase

able to draw on expertise already gained from the study on 
household expectations established in April 2019, which 
has been conducted in the form of the Bundesbank Online 
Panel Households (BOP- HH) at regular monthly intervals 
since April 2020. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2019).

the participating firms; the linked data are only analysed in 
anonymised form and only at the Bundesbank.
3 The fourth wave of the survey took place during the 
months of January, February and March 2021, with 99.2% 
of firms surveyed during January and February. The survey 
period for Wave 4 is therefore specified as “January-  
February 2021” below. In addition, a pre- test among just 
under 1,000 enterprises was conducted and evaluated be -
fore the survey of firms commenced. The data from this 
survey are not taken into account in this article.Deutsche Bundesbank

Survey concept of the study on the expectations of fi  rms 
in Germany
Between 9,150 and 16,241 fi  rms have par-
ticipated in each wave of the Bundesbank 
study on the expectations of fi  rms online in 
the four consecutive survey periods to date. 
The analysis of the fi  rst four waves thus in-
corporates over 48,000 fully completed 
questionnaires from a total of over 30,000 
different fi  rms, with about 10,000 of these 
fi  rms having participated in the study more 
than once. Conducting the survey online en-
sures short fi  eldwork periods,1 quick data 
processing and therefore a timely insight into 
the current situation of fi  rms in Germany.
The questionnaires in the Bundesbank study 
comprise a set of key questions and varying 
question modules drawn up by Bundesbank 
staff. One main focus of the fi  rst few survey 
waves has been the direct and indirect ef-
fects of the coronavirus pandemic. These 
include, for example, the impact of the 
temporary VAT cut as well as that of poten-
tial liquidity bottlenecks.
The participating fi  rms make up a represen-
tative selection of Germany’s corporate 
landscape. To ensure this, the sample for 
the study is drawn by means of a random 
selection process from all enterprises domi-
ciled in Germany with at least one member 
of staff being subject to social security con-
tributions or with turnover exceeding 
€17,500, and for which further information 
required for the sample is available.2
1 In the context of a written survey, the fi  eldwork 
period is the benchmark used for the time needed to 
reach a suffi   cient response rate.
2 The necessary information includes the name of the 
fi  rm, its full address (street, house number, postal 
code, city/ town) and data on turnover and employ-
ment, which are required to create size categories. 
Prior to use, the addresses are validated, their spelling 
standardised to match the directory of the German 
Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy (BKG), 
and georeferenced using these reference data.Overview of methodological

text, findings concerning firms’ price changes in 
connection with the temporary VAT cut in 2020

Findings on the situation 
of enterprises in the 
coronavirus  pandemic
The coronavirus pandemic, the measures taken 
by policymakers to contain it and changes in 
the behaviour of enterprises and households 
resulted in one of the most severe economic 
slumps in post- war history, both in Germany 
and globally, in the spring of 2020. However, 
the economic effects of the coronavirus pan -
demic were characterised not only by their 
scale, but also by the speed of events. The dra -matic slump occurred abruptly and posed a 
huge challenge for business cycle analysis.5 In 
this respect, the launch of the BOP- F in June 
2020 took place at an equally unique and suit -
able point in time. At that time, up- to- date 
data, such as on the economic and financing 
situation of firms, were urgently needed in 
order to conceive adequate economic and 
monetary policy countermeasures in a swift 
and evidence-  based manner. The data col -
lected as part of the BOP- F were, therefore, of 
direct interest to the Bundesbank and also to 
other decision- makers, as well as to the public.

post inviting them to participate in the vol-
untary survey. If a fi  rm is willing to continue 
participating in the study, it is generally con-
tacted for further survey rounds at the email 
address it has provided.
When the collected data are weighted, the 
chosen sampling method and potential dis-
tortions due to fi  rms declining to participate 
are considered equally. The weights in the 
Bundesbank Online Panel Firms were se-
lected such that the distribution of fi  rms in 
terms of region, economic sector, employ-
ment category and turnover size category 
resulting from the survey is representative 
of the underlying reporting population in 
Germany.
The Bundesbank study differs from other 
corporate surveys conducted in Germany in 
that it is possible to link the data from this survey with other administrative datasets of 
the Bundesbank, if certain conditions are 
fulfi  lled.3 In total, 22,825 (73%) of the 
31,359 participating fi  rms have given their 
informed consent for the linking of their 
data.
The table on p. 35 provides an overview of 
the methodological framework of the Bun-
desbank study.

German non- fi  nancial corporations (JANIS), which the 
Bundesbank receives when conducting credit assess-
ments.

5 This is reflected, amongst other things, in the collapse in 
prices of the DAX of roughly 39% over a period of less 
than one month. On account of the intensity and speed of 
the slump, it was technically challenging to adequately 
capture key real economic changes which, unlike financial 
market data, cannot be gauged on a daily basis. Large 
parts of business cycle analysis therefore did not record key 
developments in real economic data until a relatively late 
stage.Deutsche Bundesbank

When asked to assess the economic conse -
quences of the measures taken to contain the 
coronavirus pandemic, participating enterprises 
responded both qualitatively and quantitatively, 
thus enabling a differentiated picture of their 
situation to emerge. During the fourth survey 
period (January- February 2021), a total of 48% 
of firms reported a decrease, 38% reported no 
change and 14% reported an increase in busi -
ness activity compared with the same month of 
the previous year (see the chart on p.  38).6 
There were, however, major differences across 
the sectors. Significant increases in business ac -
tivity were only identified in isolated sectors, 
such as in parts of retail or in the manufacture 
of food products, beverages and tobacco. In 
addition, the firms provided quantitative esti -
mates of pandemic- induced changes relative to 
the “typical” level of business activity, with 
2019 given as a reference year.7 At the individ -
ual firm level, the average change (compared 
with the respective same month of 2019) stood 
at -26% in May 2020, -16% in September 2020 
and -19% in December 2020 (see the adjacent

to the same month of the previous year, arranged in order of the 
decrease in activity in December 2020. Enterprises which re-
ported an increase or decrease in business activity in response to 
the qualitative question regarding changes in business activity 
were then asked how large this was. Enterprises which reported 
no change in business activity were incorporated using the value 
0. This question was not asked in the second survey period 
August-September. The darker (lighter) the grey shade, the

cation is based on self- assessments by the surveyed fi  rms.
Deutsche Bundesbank6 This means that the values improved slightly compared 
with the first survey period June-  July, when 58% of firms 
reported a decrease, 35% reported no change and 8% re -
ported an increase in business activity as a result of the 
coronavirus pandemic. In the interim period, in October-  
November, the picture looked somewhat better, however, 
with 24% of enterprises reporting a decrease, 35% report -
ing no change and 41% reporting an increase.
7 In the first survey in June-  July 2020, respondents were 
asked about business activity in May; in the third survey in 
October- November 2020, respondents were asked about 
business activity in September; and in the fourth survey in 
January- February 2021, respondents were asked about 
business activity in December.
8 The quantitative results contained in the adjacent table 
can only be applied to the overall economy to a limited ex -
tent, i.e. to the question of how large the decrease in over -
all economic activity was. This is because the weighting 
variables are dependent on four variables: region, eco -
nomic sector, enterprise size category and turnover size 
category. The weighting factors are thus not necessarily 
proportional to the influence of the respective firm on the 
overall economy. Depending on how the weights are cali -
brated, it can therefore lead to an overestimation or under -
estimation of the influence of very large firms, which repre -
sent a correspondingly large part of the overall economy. 
By contrast, the quantitative changes in activity in the 
aforementioned table represent the average decrease in 
activity at the firm level and therefore allow comparisons to 
be drawn between the sectors.Deutsche Bundesbank

vices sectors were particularly hard hit by the 
effects of the pandemic.9 It also became clear 
that, for some economic sectors, the situation 
deteriorated again considerably towards the 
end of last year owing to the renewed tighten -
ing of restrictions at that time.
Besides evaluating the effects of the pandemic 
on business activity, firms were also asked to 
assess the development of other key enterprise 
metrics in the last month prior to the survey 
(see the chart on p. 39). In spring 2020, a large 
share of firms reported, alongside a drop in 
turnover (63%), decreases in employment 
(54%) and available liquid funds (46%), and re -duced access to intermediate inputs (43%). In 
late summer and autumn, conversely, the share 
of firms reporting a deterioration in their finan -
cial and economic situation decreased. How -
ever, in the fourth quarter of 2020, firms’ eco -
nomic situation became somewhat gloomier 
once more, although the values did not reach

which a disaggregated approach was pursued in order to 
better understand inflation developments in connection 
with the coronavirus pandemic. The study determined that 
goods- producing sectors are not as severely affected by 
disinflationary tendencies as sectors which provide services. 
This is consistent with the subjective perception identified 
in the BOP- F that other service providers saw themselves as 
being particularly affected by the pandemic.Deutsche Bundesbank

extremely pressing pressing moderate slight no problem at all Problem:

the levels seen at the beginning of the pan -
demic (drop in turnover: 47%, decrease in em -
ployment: 41% and in available liquid funds: 
36%, and reduced access to intermediate in -
puts: 36%).
To gain an impression not only of the current 
situation, but also of firms’ outlook, enterprises 
were asked about their expectations for the 
next six months (see the chart on p. 39). As the 
pandemic progressed, firms initially estimated 
the medium- term development of their own 
key enterprise metrics more optimistically than 
at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. For 
example, the share of firms that expected a de -
crease in turnover fell from 52% in June-  July 
2020 to 42% in August-  September 2020. In 
October- November, expectations became 
somewhat more pessimistic once again: 47% 
of firms expected a decrease in turnover over 
the subsequent six months, while 34% ex -
pected increased financing needs (following on 
from 24% in June-  July 2020 and 28% in 
August-  September 2020). One logical explan -
ation for this is the resurgence of coronavirus 
infections coupled with the renewed tighten -
ing of containment measures, which had al -
ready been announced at the time of the sur -
vey. Expectations then remained virtually un -
changed after the turn of the year 2020-21.In addition, firms were asked about the biggest 
challenges that they expected to face over the 
next six months. Firms were also asked to rate 
the relevance to them of eight problems on a 
scale from “extremely pressing” to “no prob -
lem at all” (see the chart10 on p. 39). At the be -
ginning of the pandemic, firms considered the 
issues “high level of regulation/  government 
rules”, “closures or work restrictions due to the 
coronavirus pandemic”, “availability of skilled 
staff”11 and “finding customers” to be major 
challenges in particular. Around one- third or 
more of the firms surveyed in June-  July antici -
pated pressing problems in these areas in the 
second half of the year. In late summer and au -
tumn, almost all of the areas were viewed even 
more negatively. The perceived relevance of the 
problems largely persisted at this higher level in 
January- February 2021. On the whole it could 
be seen, however, that despite the prolonged 
restrictions due to the pandemic and the antici -
pated high level of funding required compared 
with that needed to overcome the other chal -
lenges they faced, only a small number of firms 
expected difficulties in gaining access to fi -
nance.
The situation and outlook for employment 
were additional key variables that had already 
been directly affected by the coronavirus pan -
demic from its onset. Expectations regarding 
the employment rate are a particularly import -
ant economic indicator as they give an indica -
tion of a firm’s general expectations and may 
also influence inflation via wage developments. 
To assess the relevance of these expectations, 
the Bundesbank surveyed firms in the BOP- F 
about current employment developments over 
the last month and about their expectations re -
garding employment developments over the 
next six months.After brief recov -

Initially, positive developments in the employ -
ment situation12 could be observed from the 
summer months through to the autumn of 
2020, but this did not continue into the winter 
months (see the chart on p. 40). With the ex -
ception of the fourth quarter, the employment 
outlook for the next six months was more posi -
tive than the assessment of the current em -
ployment situation. This signals a certain, albeit 
low level of optimism on the part of firms re -
garding employment growth. Some firms ap -
pear to have anticipated the sharp decline in 
employment in the winter months, as the data 
on the employment outlook were already de -
clining in the autumn poll. It is also interesting 
to consider the breakdown of firms by size: in 
the first survey in June and July, larger13 enter -
prises reported sharper decreases in employ -
ment and were also more pessimistic with re -
gard to expected employment growth than 
smaller firms. However, this correlation turned 
around over the autumn and winter, as larger 
firms then reported more positive employment 
developments and predicted more positive 
growth than smaller enterprises.
An unusual feature of the economic problems 
experienced during the pandemic is the fact 
that countless firms in Germany and abroad 
had to scale back their economic activity sig -
nificantly or even shut down completely at the 
same time. This caused slumps in international 
trade, leading to disruptions in existing supply 
chains. The issue was exacerbated by border 
closures and travel restrictions. As a result, sup -
pliers and purchasers of commodities were out 
of action throughout the supply chain for a 
large number of firms. In the survey, firms were 
asked to assess the severity of the impact of 
interrupted supply chains. Specifically, they 
were asked how problematic they thought “ac -
cess to intermediate inputs” would be in the 
next six months.14
In the first survey round conducted in June-  July 
2020, 9.7% of the responding firms stated that 
they were facing serious supply chain prob -
lems.15 This value remained largely the same in the second wave around July-  August, at 9.5%. 
In the third wave (October- November), the 
share of firms with supply chain problems rose 
slightly to 12.9%, continuing to rise to 14.4% 
in the fourth wave (February 2021). This devel -Employment

The fact that supply chain problems built up 
over time after firms’ own stock levels or their 
suppliers’ stocks were depleted might explain 
the slight rise from 9.7% in June-  July 2020 to 
14.4% in January-  February 2021. However, 
both this moderate increase and the overall 
level should be viewed against the backdrop of 
the more dramatic collapse of supply chains in 
the second quarter, immediately after the out -
break of the coronavirus pandemic. This shock 
to supply chains, which was triggered by the 
global measures being put in place from March 
2020 after the pandemic began, was not re -
corded by the BOP- F as it occurred before the 
start of the first survey wave. It can be assumed 
that a recovery from the prior breakdown in 
the supply chains was already taking place dur -
ing the June-  July survey, putting the figures 
above (and their increase over time) into per -
spective. For example, in a DIHK survey17 con-
ducted in March 2020, every fourth company 
reported missing goods or services in its pro -
duction, and every fifth reported logistical 
bottlenecks. The first shock was particularly se -
vere for supply chains because firms were com -
pletely unprepared when it occurred. Regard -ing the ongoing issues encountered in supply 
chains throughout 2020, it can be assumed 
that logistical adjustment processes and stand- 
by options were available and were also con -
sciously employed.
Sector classification played a considerable role 
in the assessment of the problem, as supply 
chains are especially important in trade, the 
manufacture of intermediate goods, construc -
tion and the production of capital goods and 
consumer durables. As a result, these sectors 
were recently hit particularly hard by supply 
problems. The chart on p. 41 shows the devel -
opments in construction, wholesale and retail 
and the manufacturing sectors.
Financial situation of firms 
in Germany
The survey on firms is also a major source of in -
formation for banking supervision and financial 
stability analysis. For example, questions about 
the liquidity position and the supply of credit to 
the firms surveyed provide an important indica -
tion of potential disruption to the functioning 
of the financial sector. As the chart on p. 39 il -
lustrates, decreasing turnover at the start of the 
coronavirus crisis caused a temporary rise in fi -
nancing needs in the business sector.
To assess the impact of the pandemic, firms 
were asked whether they had been involved in 
loan negotiations and whether any potential 
borrowing was attributable to the coronavirus 
pandemic. The share of firms conducting loan

16 Starting from the second poll in August-  September, 
firms were also able to answer “does not apply to my en -
terprise” in addition to the scale from 1 to 5. Whilst only 
7% of the manufacturing firms stated that supply problems 
did not apply to them, 30% of the enterprises in the ser -
vices sector selected this option. This, too, indicates consid -
erable sectoral differences.
17 See DIHK (2020). The survey took place from 24 to 
26 March 2020 and included around 15,000 firms.

coronavirus crisis remained roughly constant at 
around 10% over the observation period be -
tween March and December 2020. By contrast, 
just over 20% of firms initiated loan negoti -
ations at the start of the pandemic in the spring 
of 2020 due to the coronavirus crisis. This share 
fell over time to around 10% in the fourth 
quarter of 2020 (see the chart on p. 42). This is 
consistent with the assessments of other bank -
ing statistics which show that a significantly 
higher quantity of loans were granted to Ger -
man firms in March and April 2020 than is usu -
ally the case (see Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2020b)). Although demand for borrowing or 
establishing a credit line declined again after the initial months of the crisis, a large portion 
of the demand for credit is still attributable to 
the pandemic.
The outcome of the loan negotiations indicates 
whether the surveyed firms encountered diffi -
culties in accessing bank loans in the wake of 
the pandemic. The survey results show that 
firms applying for bank loans irrespective of the 
pandemic saw an improvement in their access 
to credit in the period from March to Decem -
ber 2020. For instance, the share of loans 
granted at the desired amount and the desired 
conditions rose from 55% in the second quar -
ter to 62% in the fourth quarter of 2020 (see Loan applica -

gotiations were initiated and conducted due to 
the pandemic, the share of loans approved at 
the desired conditions has remained constant 
at around 30% since the start of the pandemic. 
On the other hand, the share of loan negoti -
ations conducted due to the pandemic that 
were concluded without a deal was consist -
ently higher than for loan negotiations initiated 
irrespective of the coronavirus pandemic, and 
the former reached its peak of 41% in the third 
quarter.
The chart on p. 43 shows the outcome of the 
loan negotiations according to how firms’ li -
quidity positions have changed. For 37% of the 
firms that recorded liquidity losses in the second 
quarter of 2020, loan negotiations conducted 
between March and May of 2020 were con -
cluded without a deal. After rising to 41% in 
the third quarter, the share of firms with declin -
ing liquidity that concluded loan applications 
without a deal fell to 32% in the autumn and 
winter months. The slight improvement in 
these firms’ access to credit was also reflected 
in the share of loan negotiations that were ap -
proved as applied for. By contrast, firms that 
did not report a deterioration in their liquidity 
positions had much better outcomes in their 
loan negotiations. This suggests a link between 
a firm’s liquidity difficulties and problems it ex -
perienced in accessing credit.
To assess the scale of potential financial bottle -
necks for firms, they were polled on their avail -
able liquidity reserves in February 2021. Firms 
were asked to estimate for how long a period 
they would continue to have sufficient liquidity 
before having to discontinue or abandon their 
business activities. It is apparent that difficulties 
in accessing credit and available liquidity re -
serves can influence each other. One- quarter of 
respondents stated that they generally have 
sufficient liquidity. In February 2021, 36% 
(38%) of firms were facing a liquidity bottle -
neck within the next two months (in three to 
twelve months). Comparing the available li -

ruary 2021 with the results of the loan negoti -
ations conducted in the fourth quarter of 2020 
paints the following picture (see the upper 
chart on p. 44): firms that, according to their 
own assessment in February 2021, were facing 
liquidity shortfalls in March and April 2021 had 
much worse outcomes in their loan negoti -
ations in the fourth quarter of 2020. 27% of 
the loan applications of these firms were ap -
proved as applied for, while the share of loan 
negotiations that concluded with no deal stood 
at 36%. By contrast, 67% of the firms that gen -
erally had sufficient liquidity in February 2021 
received approval for their loan applications at 
the desired conditions in the fourth quarter of 
2020 and 10% concluded without a deal.
In order to shield the business sector as far as 
possible from both the fallout from the pan -
demic and the impact of the measures taken to 
contain it, the government initiated various 
support measures. In the fourth wave of the 
survey, firms were asked about their use of these support measures. Just under half of the 
firms surveyed indicated that they had made 
use of short- time working benefits during the 
pandemic (see the chart at the bottom of 
p.  44). Around 40% of firms were able to 
benefit from the emergency aid paid out at the 
onset of the pandemic. Tax deferral options 
(24%), the KfW special programme (12%), 
grants under bridging aid packages (12%) and 
the November- December aid (10%) saw lower 
uptake, whereas the guarantee programmes 
via guarantee banks and government equity 
interests were barely used at all. Furthermore, 
at the time of the survey in February 2021, the 
number of applications still pending for both 
bridging aid and the November- December aid 
was relatively high and the rejection rate was 
higher still.

were particularly high (see the chart on p. 45): 
the corresponding shares of responses totalled 
around 80% for bridging aid, November-  
December aid and short- time working benefits. 
By contrast, demand for loans via the KfW spe -
cial programme was lower but still amounted 
to 36% for firms in this sector.
An abrupt discontinuation of public support 
measures could potentially result in cliff effects. 
The February 2021 survey thus asked firms that 
had taken up the corresponding measures how 
well they would be able to cope if these were 
to be discontinued at the end of the month. In 
the hotel and restaurant sector, 80% of the 
firms using bridging aid, November- December 
aid and short- time working benefits stated that 
they would have difficulties if the programme 
in question were to be discontinued (see the 
chart on p. 45).
Firms’ inflation expectations
Inflation expectations play a key role in eco -
nomic decisions. Just as the expected rate of 
inflation is a central factor in individuals’ and 
households’ consumption- savings decisions,19 
in the business sector it impacts on investment 
decisions as well as wage and price setting.20 
Information about inflation expectations is therefore required in order to understand and 
forecast economic behaviour as well as to ef -
fectively influence it using targeted communi -
cation. Measuring inflation expectations is thus 
of particular importance for monetary policy.21
The VAT cut in the second half of 2020 pre -
sented a suitable opportunity to analyse infla -
tion expectations, in particular to investigate 
the extent to which economic measures 
prompted firms to adjust their prices (see also 
the box on pp. 47 ff.).
Despite the relevance of the business sector’s 
inflation expectations, most of the existing sur -
veys on inflation expectations still focus on in -
dividuals or professional forecasters. This is be -

19 See, for example, Vellekoop and Wiederholt (2019) as

conclusion that households with higher inflation expect -
ations save less.
20 Coibion et al. (2020b) present an interesting study in 
this regard that is also based on survey data. The experi -
ment, based on Banca d’Italia’s panel of firms, examines 
the impact of an exogenous increase in the expected rate 
of inflation. The authors find that higher inflation expect -
ations lead firms to raise their prices, increase demand for 
credit and reduce employment. Furthermore, Grasso and 
Ropele (2018) identify a positive correlation between the 
amount of expected inflation and firms’ willingness to in -
vest.

tion as to whether central banks could use the rate of infla -
tion expected by economic agents as an explicit tool to 
control inflation.Deutsche Bundesbank

Firms’ price adjustments over the course of the temporary 
VAT cut in 2020
In June 2020, as part of its package of eco-
nomic stimulus and crisis management 
measures, the Federal Government decided 
to lower the standard VAT rate (“turnover 
tax rate” according to tax law) from 19% to 
16% and the reduced VAT rate from 7% to 
5% for the period from 1 July 2020 to 31 De-
cember 2020.1 Above all, the measure aimed 
to boost private consumption and strengthen 
the German economy.2 A temporary VAT cut 
such as this can only have a positive demand 
effect if fi  rms tend to lower their prices in re-
sponse to the tax cut and customers expect 
that fi  rms will tend to raise their prices fol-
lowing the reversal of the VAT cut. Whether, 
and to what extent, the reduction in VAT 
rates was actually passed on to consumers is 
an empirical question. Existing studies on 
the pass- through of the recent temporary 
VAT cut in Germany focus mainly on analys-
ing individual fi  rms or products.3 In addition, 
the impact on the Harmonised Index of Con-
sumer Prices (HICP) was estimated using a 
disaggregated approach.4 To gain deeper in-
sights into the price- setting behaviour of the 
German corporate sector beyond that, the 
Bundesbank asked fi  rms, in the context of its 
Bundesbank Online Panel Firms, about the price adjustments made over the course of 
the temporary VAT cut and the reasons be-
hind them.
The Bundesbank’s survey of fi  rms covers all 
economic sectors and categories of goods. 
In terms of the evaluations relating to the 
temporary VAT change, this means that not 
only are prices of transactions between 
fi  rms and households captured, but also 
those for business- to- business sales.
The survey results show that just over one- 
third of the fi  rms lowered their prices (on 
average across all products or services) 
roughly in line with the VAT cut in July 2020 
1 The reduced tax rate applies in the special cases 
listed in Section 12(2) of the Turnover Tax Act (Umsatz-
steuergesetz), which includes goods for everyday use.

or shortly beforehand.5 By contrast, more 
than half of the fi  rms kept their prices 
roughly the same, according to the survey 
results. Moreover, 5% of the fi  rms re-
sponded that they had increased their 
prices despite the VAT cut. As a result, many 
fi  rms did not pass on the lower tax rate to 
their customers.
Information on fi  rms’ motives can point to 
the factors that played a role in their price- 
setting behaviour. For fi  rms whose price re-
duction matched the VAT cut exactly, the 
most important reason was to meet cus-
tomer expectations (60%). In addition, 
some fi  rms indicated that their buyers en-
titled to input tax deductions would experi-
ence a loss otherwise (36%). Another im-
portant reason given was competitors redu-
cing their prices (30%).
Among fi  rms that left their prices un-
changed, many felt that the organisational 
effort was too great given the short period of time in which the VAT cut would apply 
(42%). Furthermore, some fi  rms apparently 
used the VAT cut to improve their profi  ts 
which had contracted sharply during the 
coronavirus crisis (25%). Some also re-
ported that they had reviewed their prices 
in response to the tax cut and ultimately left 
them unchanged (24%).
Further information from the Bundesbank’s 
business survey supports the hypothesis that 
suffering a particularly sharp decline in sales 
due to the coronavirus pandemic played at 
least a partial role in the VAT cut not being 
passed on to the full extent. For example, a 
disproportionately large number of fi  rms in 
the hotels and restaurants sector, which was 
hit especially hard by the crisis or the contain-Most important reasons for price adjustments in July 2020

relevant questions on price changes. Firms whose 
products or services are exempt from VAT, whose

ment measures, reported having left their 
prices unchanged. Additionally, a larger share 
of the respondents that had made no price 
adjustments reported sharp declines in pro-
duction due to the coronavirus pandemic, 
staff in short- time work and deferred pay-
ment obligations. Thus, motives related to 
ensuring liquidity are likely to have also 
played a role in the incomplete pass- through.6
The VAT rates returned to their original 
levels as from 1 January 2021. The survey re-
sults for fi  rms’ price adjustments after the 
VAT change was rolled back resemble those 
after the VAT cut in July 2020. Roughly one- 
third of the fi  rms raised their prices in line 
with the tax increase, according to the data 
they provided. More than half of the fi  rms 
left their prices unchanged after the meas-
ure was reversed. At the same time, around 
one- quarter of the fi  rms adjusted their 
prices in January 2021 across all response 
categories in a way that did not mirror the 
changes in July 2020, which could be down 
to changed demand or different costs. 
Prices decreased on balance for around 
one- fi  fth of fi  rms over the period of the two 
VAT changes, while ultimately increasing for 
just one- tenth of them. Unlike in other 
countries which had previously lowered 
their VAT rates for a temporary period, the 
present survey results provide no indication 
that fi  rms in Germany increased their prices 
even before the tax rates were raised again.7
The results of the present business survey 
cannot be translated directly to the HICP . 
The reasons for this are twofold: fi  rst, the 
results include fi  rms which do not produce 
consumer goods. Second, the data do not 
contain detailed information on the various 
categories of consumption (according to 
the Classifi  cation of Individual Consumption 
by Purpose, or COICOP) of the relevant 
goods and services of fi  rms; these would 
allow the results to be aggregated with the 
corresponding HICP weights. According to 
a regression- based disaggregated ap-proach, around two- thirds of the VAT cut in 
July 2020 was passed on to consumers, 
though there were major differences be-
tween the goods and services included in 
the HICP .8 While pass- through was arguably 
almost complete for goods and the price 
reduction for some food products and in-
dustrial goods even exceeded the VAT cut, 
it was rather moderate for services.
An analysis of the pass- through of the in-
crease in VAT rates in January 2021 using 
the same regression- based approach shows 
that it appears to have occurred more or 
less symmetrically. This applies to both 
headline HICP and the categories of goods 
and services it contains.9 This approach also 
shows that prices were raised again as early 
as December 2020 only in rare cases. By 
contrast, it seems a number of VAT- related 
price increases for food products and indus-
trial goods were not made until February 
2021. This may be partly because it was not 
possible to collect prices for some goods in 
January 2021 due to the restrictive meas-
ures put in place by government.
To summarise, it can be noted – both from 
the results of the survey of fi  rms and the 
analyses conducted using disaggregated 
HICP data – that the temporary VAT cut was 
refl  ected less strongly in prices than would 
have been expected in the case of a full 
pass- through. Both analyses also indicate 
that the price adjustments made in July 
2020 and January 2021 largely cancelled 
each other out, which implies that the tem-
porary VAT cut has no long- lasting impact 
on the aggregate price level.

spective, see Kim (2021).

9 At the same time, it makes no difference that the 
VAT cut was extended for food and beverage service 
activities to the end of 2022, because this analytical 
approach, too, reveals that the VAT cut was barely 
passed on to consumers. Moreover, at 3%, this com-
ponent makes up a fairly small share of headline HICP .Deutsche Bundesbank

cause it is easier to collect their expectations 
than to survey firms – be it on inflation expect -

data that cannot be simply extracted from the results of 
other surveys.
23 In addition, the results from the BOP-F are not just of 
use to the Bundesbank but, thanks to comparability with 
data from other countries, can be used by the entire Euro -
system. This enables heterogeneities in inflation expect -
ations in the European business sector to be identified 
more readily. The Polish and Italian central banks, for in -
stance, also conduct regular surveys of firms’ inflation ex -

Results of the Bundesbank 
Online Panel Firms on 
inflation  expectations
The first survey of firms’ assessments of the 
perceived rate of inflation over the past twelve 
months as well as of the expected rate of infla -
tion for the coming twelve months was con -
ducted in October- November 2020.25 The chart 
on p. 46 shows the rates of inflation expected 
by firms, whereby their point estimates26 have 
been grouped in intervals. The data show that, 
over a one- year horizon, firms do not expect 
inflation to rise in relation to the estimated rate 
of inflation over the past twelve months; on 
average, firms assume that inflation stood at 
1.5% over the past twelve months and forecast 
that it will stay at 1.5% for the coming twelve 
months.27 The expectations are therefore on a 
par with the results from other surveys pre -
sented in the overview on p. 50. In addition, 
the fact that the realised inflation rate esti -
mated by firms is identical to the expected in -
flation rate indicates that firms’ inflation ex -
pectations are firmly anchored despite the eco -
nomic downturn. The Bundesbank Online Panel 
Households (BOP- HH) arrived at similar results. 
In both the BOP- F and the BOP- HH, the hetero -
geneity28 of inflation expectations relating to 
the past twelve months is lower than the het -
erogeneity of inflation expectations relating to 
the expectations horizon for the coming twelve 
months (for more information, see the box on 
pp. 52 ff.).
Outlook
The first four survey waves of the BOP- F, con -
ducted between June 2020 and February 2021, 
have demonstrated that surveying firms directly generates valuable information for the Bundes -
bank enabling it to carry out its core tasks, such 
as safeguarding monetary and financial stabil -
ity. The rapid availability of the data and the 
fact that they can be tailored to meet the Bun -
desbank’s needs make the survey particularly 
useful. In light of these findings, the Bundes -
bank will continue to use the BOP- F to survey 
firms on relevant topics. Going forward, it plans 
to conduct the survey at monthly intervals. 
After having made permanent improvements 
to the available information on households’ as -
sessments and expectations, the Bundesbank 
will now do the same for firms.
The data and findings obtained will be made 
public. The results of the Bundesbank’s 
internet-based BOP-HH and BOP-F will be pub -
lished on the Research Centre’s internet portal. 
In addition to findings from the surveys, the 
portal also contains explanatory videos and 
notes, background information, working and 
discussion papers prepared using the data as 
well as notes on using the anonymised micro -
data for research purposes.29Firms do not

25 Inflation expectations were not surveyed in the first two 
waves in June-  July 2020 and August-  September 2020 be -
cause questions relating to the real economy, in particular 
production and business activities, and to firms’ financing 
situation were considered more pressing.
26 Point estimates on the expected rate of inflation were 
collected in two stages. Participants were initially asked: 
“Do you expect there to be inflation or deflation in Ger -
many over the next twelve months?” They were then asked 
for a precise figure: “Roughly what do you expect the rate 
of inflation/ deflation in Germany to be over the next twelve 
months?”
27 In line with the literature, for example, van der Klaauw 
et al. (2008), only responses between -12% and +12% 
were considered when assessing inflation expectations. For 
more information on the median and the standard devi -
ation of inflation expectations, see the table on p. 53.

A comparison of the infl  ation estimates of fi  rms and 
 households
In both of the Bundesbank’s online surveys, 
Bundesbank Online Panel Firms (BOP- F) and 
Bundesbank Online Panel Households (BOP- 
HH), fi  rms and households answered identi-
cal questions on infl  ation expectations. This 
allows a direct comparison which is shown 
in the chart below, depicting the perceived 
infl  ation rate of the past twelve months and 
the expected infl  ation rate for the next 
twelve months.1 In both cases, fi  rms tend 
to assume a lower level of infl  ation (see the 
table on p. 53). Furthermore, the standard 
deviation of individual estimates is lower for 
fi  rms than for households. Firms’ estimates 
are thus more similar to one another than 
household estimates.
It is worth looking at the disparity between 
the infl  ation estimates of fi  rms and house-
holds more closely. Generally, it can be seen that the infl  ation estimates of fi  rms are 
more accurate. First, fi  rms’ estimates of the 
actual infl  ation rate over the past twelve 
months are closer to the infl  ation rate actu-
ally realised2 (although fi  rms did overesti-
mate this as well). Second, the estimate of 
the future infl  ation rate over the next twelve 
months is nearer to the average estimates 
1 The infl  ation estimates of fi  rms were surveyed in Oc-
tober and November 2020. The survey period for 
households is slightly different owing to the structure 
of the surveys: households’ perceived infl  ation rate 
was surveyed in September 2020, while their expected 
infl  ation rate was surveyed in October 2020.
2 In October and November 2020, the Federal Statis-
tical Offi   ce indicated that the actual infl  ation rate over 
the past twelve months stood at -0.2% and -0.3% re-
spectively (consumer price index) or -0.5% and -0.7% 
respectively (Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices).

of professional forecasters.3 Third, the het-
erogeneity of fi  rms’ estimates, measured by 
the standard deviation of all individual esti-
mates, is lower than for households.
A similar pattern can be observed when the 
estimates of respondents in the BOP- HH are 
differentiated by income and level of edu-
cation. The adjacent chart shows the ex-
pected infl  ation rates over a period of 
twelve months surveyed in the BOP- HH, 
and it illustrates that respondents with a 
higher level of education and with a higher 
income expect a lower infl  ation rate.4 This 
implies that the disparity between the esti-
mates in the BOP- F and the BOP- HH might 
be explained by the fact that the respond-
ents in the BOP- F represent a specifi  c cross- 
section of the overall population surveyed 
in the BOP- HH. When surveyed for the fi  rst 
time, each fi  rm in the BOP- F is asked about 
the area of the enterprise that the respond-
ent works in and which job title best de-
scribes their role. It became evident that in 
each of the four waves almost 90% of the 
respondents were working in the “Manage-
ment board” area and that in all four waves 
almost 90% of the respondents chose 
“Owner/ executive director/ member of the 
management board/ holder of a general 
commercial power of attorney” as their job 
title. This suggests that the respondents in 
the BOP- F represent a cross- section of the 
overall population with potentially above 
average incomes and above average levels 
of education. If this is the case, the fact that 
3 For example, the experts in the (fi  nancial) industry 
that responded to the European Central Bank’s Survey 
of Professional Forecasters in the fourth quarter of 
2020 predicted an infl  ation rate of 0.3% for 2020 and 
0.9% for 2021.
4 This also applies to the estimates of the actual infl  a-
tion rate over the past months that were surveyed in 
September 2020: households with lower levels of edu-
cation or lower incomes assume a higher actual infl  a-
tion rate. In addition, the standard deviation of the in-
fl  ation estimates of households with a higher level of 
education or higher income is lower in each case.Average household expectations of the

the panel on fi  rms was largely answered by 
people with a higher income and level of 
education than the average member of the 
public may explain the differences revealed 
between households and fi  rms.
As the above- described survey of expect-
ations as a point estimate is less nuanced, 
alternative methods have been developed 
that provide more information at the level 
of the individual participant. For instance, 
another established method of measuring 
infl  ation estimates is the elicitation of prob-
abilistic expectations (Manski (2004)). In 
this approach, various intervals are specifi  ed 
and respondents state how likely they think 
it is that the future infl  ation rate will fall 
within the respective interval.5 This type of 
expectation measurement was used for 
both fi  rms and households in the Bundes-
bank’s online surveys and the results are 
compared below.The adjacent chart shows that the interval 
that includes expected infl  ation rates be-
tween 0% and 2% accounts for the largest 
probability mass for both fi  rms and house-
holds. The remaining probability mass is 
spread symmetrically across the other inter-
vals, with the tail ends being rated as more 
unlikely. Comparing the estimates of fi  rms 
and households allows two conclusions to 
be drawn that are consistent with the re-
sults of the point estimates in the chart on 
p. 52. First, households expect a higher in-
fl  ation rate than fi  rms, since a greater prob-
ability mass is assigned to infl  ation scen-
arios in each case (and less to scenarios in-
volving defl  ation). Second, it can be seen 
that the distribution of the probability mass 
is fl  atter for households. Probabilistic ex-
pectations thus corroborate the fi  nding that 
households are more uncertain than fi  rms 
in probabilistic estimates, too.Probabilistic inflation expectations

Digital money: options for payments
The world of payments has been experiencing dynamic structural change for some time now. 
Advancing digitalisation has spawned new payment solutions, and fintech firms are offering 
digital solutions for certain stages in the value chain. State- of- the- art techniques, notably distrib -
uted ledger technology (DLT), support new forms of digital money that can be sent across innova -
tive and decentralised networks in the form of tokens, while bigtech firms – technology or data- 
driven platform providers with a large customer base – are offering payment solutions of their 
own, with some even planning to roll out their own stablecoins. Given these developments, the 
payments space has come to be regarded as strategically important, not just for the future of 
Europe’s  financial industry but also for European sovereignty in an increasingly globalised and 
digital world. The Eurosystem likewise sees an urgent need for Europe to develop common pay -
ment solutions.
How new forms of digital money are designed should be based first and foremost on its intended 
functions. To generally qualify as payment instruments, new forms of money need to be stable in 
value, universal and readily convertible into other forms of money with as little friction as pos -
sible, just like their conventional counterparts. As far as the security of payments is concerned, 
transactions in central bank money have to meet stricter standards. Though distributed networks 
themselves are unlikely to improve the efficiency of payments, DLT can support integrated settle -
ment and payment processes across firms, allowing automated and synchronised service and 
money flows. For this to work, payments would need to be programmable either as tokenised 
money or by creating a technical bridge (trigger solution) between private sector DLT systems and 
the conventional payments space. All factors considered, money that can be used in program -
mable applications could deliver efficiency gains.
Work has been picking up worldwide to develop central bank digital currency (CBDC), which 
would be a third type of central bank money alongside cash and deposits in central bank 
accounts. Most central bank projects are looking at CBDC that would be available to the general 
public.
Central bank digital currency offers opportunities, but it also has its risks. In principle, large- scale 
substitution away from commercial bank money into CBDC could impact monetary policy and 
financial stability and reduce the importance of banks as intermediaries in the financial system. It 
is also important to note that the balance of private and public sector activity in the payments 
space could tilt significantly away from the private sector, with adverse implications for innov -
ation and heightened financial risk as a result of the central bank’s longer balance sheet.
October 2020 saw the Eurosystem publish a report on the possible issuance of central bank 
digital currency for the euro area. This digital euro would be introduced alongside cash; it would 
not replace it. At present, various avenues for the potential implementation of CBDC and a var -
iety of possible design options are being explored within the Eurosystem. The ECB Governing 
Council is expected to decide on the road ahead during the summer.Deutsche Bundesbank

Digital transformation 
in payments
The past decade has seen innovative technolo -
gies (notably distributed ledger technology, or 
DLT1) and new market players accelerate and 
intensify the digitalisation process in payments. 
Publication of the Bitcoin white paper in 2008 
was a notable event in that it marked the first 
time a new form of distributed payment sys -
tem, one that excluded banks or central inter -
mediaries, was brought to the table.2 Today’s 
payments space is made up not just of central 
bank- issued cash, but primarily of book money 
deposited with credit institutions which can be 
transferred using credit transfers, direct debits 
or card payments. Another category that has 
been emerging of late is “digital money”, 
though there are different interpretations of 
what this term actually means. It very often re -
fers to money that can be used in the form of 
digital tokens3 in DLT systems. Pure crypto 
tokens like Bitcoin and Ether have not man -
aged to gain a foothold in the payments mar -
ket as yet, however, so the debate is coalescing 
around digital payment instruments that are 
linked to existing forms of money but are either 
delivered in a technically modified form or use 
existing forms of money to underpin their 
value.
For decades now, it has only been possible to 
cope with the mounting volumes of cashless 
payments – Germany alone accounts for more 
than 20 billion transactions each year – by con -
tinuously standardising, harmonising and auto -
mating operations and processes. Recent years 
have seen the digital transformation bring fresh 
momentum to the world of cashless payments, 
primarily on the back of changes in payment 
behaviour, regulatory changes and technical in -
novation. One notable example has been the 
surge in cashless payments in response to the 
COVID-  19 pandemic. The Bundesbank’s de -
tailed study of payment behaviour in Germany 
in autumn 2020 found that card payments in 
particular had grown significantly in import -
ance, now accounting for roughly 30% of all the payments recorded in the study.4 The in -
crease in contactless payments was a key fac -
tor here. One major driver of digitalisation in 
payments, besides contactless payments at the 
point of sale, is the increasing prevalence of 
digital payment solutions in online commerce, 
above all those delivered by global card sys -
tems and similar solutions offered by new pro -
viders like fintech and bigtech firms.
Fintech firms are harnessing new technical so -
lutions like open architecture, sometimes with 
standardised interfaces (application program -
ming interfaces, or APIs) linking them to banks’ 
account management systems and app tech -
nologies for smartphones to either deliver indi -
vidual stages of the value chain or replace them 
altogether with new processes. In addition, fi -
nancially powerful tech companies with an 
existing platform and large customer base are 
also pushing into the payments market. What 
sets these bigtech firms, as they are known, 
apart from the majority of fintech players is 
that they are less reliant on cooperating with 
existing providers. They can leverage their 
broad customer base to harness significant net -
work effects that can quickly achieve sufficient 
market penetration.5Fast- moving

5 Network effects or network externalities exist when the 
utility an individual user derives from a good or service de -
pends on the number of other users of that good or ser -
vice. Network externalities are positive when increasing 
user numbers incentivise the use of a given good, service 
or technology. Telephone lines are a classic example of this 
phenomenon: the more people an individual user can 
reach by telephone, the greater the utility that user can de -
rive from having a telephone of their own. In other words, 
one additional telephone line benefits not just the new 
telephone user but increases the utility value of the tele -
phone network for all existing and future telephone users.Deutsche Bundesbank

The delivery of payment services –  and of a 
broader range of financial services beyond 
that – can add significantly to the ecosystems 
of major platforms for two reasons. First, it en -
ables all activities – from the first information 
on a purchase all the way through to pay -
ment – to be integrated on a single platform. 
Second, payment data and purchases are a 
more reliable pool of data for understanding 
customer behaviour. Furthermore, customer 
transaction data gathered outside the respect -
ive platform might also be available for analysis 
from third- party service providers.
It can be expected that the expansion of the 
information  and purchase process to include 
payment services fitted with as little friction as 
possible into these new ecosystems will result 
in these platforms wielding greater market 
power.6 While it is true that banks and bank ac -
counts will continue to play a major role ini -
tially, the new market entrants – bigtech firms 
and global card systems – and the apps they 
offer as digital customer interfaces are likely to 
become increasingly important for customers.
One outcome of the European market for pay -
ment services being increasingly reliant on non- 
European infrastructure is a growing view in 
political circles that payments is a strategically 
important sector for European sovereignty. This 
awareness has set in motion a raft of initiatives 
and political activities aimed at achieving im -
provements and efficiency gains in payments 
(see the box on pp. 60 f.).
One notable function of new technologies is 
their ability to automatically link payments with 
other processes. In a simple use case involving 
internal company processes, a firm could lever -
age payment data for analytical purposes in 
product development or integrate payment 
transactions into its accounting processes. A 
more complex case concerns the integration of 
payment and settlement processes across firms, 
which is a capability that DLT in particular is able 
to offer.7 Using DLT, it is possible to transfer to -
kenised digital assets between distinct entities. Not just that: DLT and in particular what are 
known as smart contracts8 can fully automate 
the performance of complex legal events, pro -
vided that both sides of the transaction (service 
and money) are either themselves tokenised9 
and programmable or can be used in program -
mable applications (see the box on p. 62).
The use of DLT in the settlement of complex 
processes in which the transaction data might 
still be needed for downstream processes can 
lower transaction costs. DLT does away with 
numerous reconciliation processes because a 
distributed data ledger means that all the par -
ties involved can access the same set of data. 
Furthermore, it can be used to automate recur -
ring processes. Ideally, smart contracts can 
manage all aspects of synchronised and auto -
mated service and money flows by following 
previously defined rules. Thus, the use of DLT 
could be an important building block in digit -
ally transforming an economy.
On the whole, programmability is proving to be 
the crucial new feature that payments need to 
have in order to maximise the potential of the 
digital transformation and harness the poten -
tial benefits and efficiency gains of DLT. There 
are, however, a number of other features be -
sides programmability that characterise today’s 
distributed payment systems and the forms of 
money used there.
– Direct, intermediary- free transferability from 
payer to payee: physical money (cash) is 
transferred under property law without an 
intermediary because third parties do not 
need to be involved. This is why fully an -
onymous payments (transactions that leave 
no digital traces) are not possible with digital 
money.10… as a poten -

Initiatives and political activities in the payments market
The European Commission adopted its Re-
tail Payments Strategy in the autumn of 
2020.1 In this framework, it calls for the 
introduction of instant payments that are 
credited to the recipient’s account within 
just a few seconds as the “new normal” 
and encourages private sector initiatives to 
establish a common European payments 
solution.
The Eurosystem, too, believes that develop-
ing pan- European payment solutions is in-
dispensable for the digital age in order to 
be able to ensure that payments are effi   -
cient, competitive and anchored in Europe 
going forward.2 Such applications should:
– work online, at the point of sale and be-
tween individuals;
– be usable throughout Europe with a card 
or digital devices such as a smartphone;
– be subject to European governance;
– ideally bundle all services under a com-
mon brand.
A number of European payment service 
providers joined forces to create the Euro-
pean Payments Initiative (EPI) with a view to 
developing a European solution like this 
based on SEPA instant payments. At present, 
however, only around 70% of the relevant 
payment service providers in the euro area 
support SEPA instant payments, which cur-
rently only make up just under 8% of all 
credit transfers. Additional efforts are there-
fore necessary to deepen the EU single mar-
ket for payments and make it fi  t for the 
future  through innovation, effi   ciency and 
competition. The Eurosystem will meet the 
key technical prerequisite for the pan- European reach of instant payments in No-
vember 2021 when it becomes possible to 
settle such transactions between different 
European infrastructures using the TARGET 
Instant Payments System (TIPS).
Under the auspices of the Euro Retail Pay-
ments Board (ERPB),3 market participants 
are also working to expand the potential 
applications of instant payments. The idea 
is that, in future, individuals should also be 
able to use them to pay in shops and com-
panies will be able to connect them with a 
request to pay.4
However, given the potential integration of 
payment services into private sector ecosys-
tems that can be used around the world, 
the political debate now centres not only 
on euro- based payments but also on pay-
ments across currency areas. These remain 
relatively slow, opaque – in terms of costs 
and settlement status – and expensive as 
compared to European and national pay-
ments.5
The G20 has, since the end of 2019, in-
creasingly focused on international pay-
ments, including remittance payments, and 
is pushing for concrete improvements. 
More effi   cient international payment solu-
tions would have tangible benefi  ts for citi-

3 The ERPB is a European body that is chaired by the 
ECB and whose objective is to promote an integrated, 
innovative and competitive market for retail payments 
in the European Union.
4 In a request to pay, the payee – an online retailer, for 
instance – sends an electronic request for payment to 
the payer’s bank through their own bank. The request 
to pay contains all information relevant for the transac-
tion. The payer, by confi  rming the request to pay in 
their online banking or their banking app, for example, 
triggers a payment through credit transfer.

tion is picking up amongst providers, and 
transaction costs are on the decline.11 How -
ever, as work by the G20 shows, action is 
still urgently needed to push back compre -
hensively against weaknesses of this kind in 
cross- border payments.
Standards for digital money
Universality of money
There are not many forms of money nowadays 
that can settle many different types of transac -tions: central bank money in the form of cash 
and in the form of deposits in central bank ac -
counts,12 and commercial bank money in the 
form of transferable deposits (including elec -
tronic money). These three forms of money 
today cover the wide variety of transactions 
used by the real economy and financial indus -
try, households and government, ranging from 
the smallest of payments at the point of sale all 
the way to transactions in the billions in the 
interbank money market. All three forms of 
money are denominated in euro and support 
one- to- one convertibility: commercial banks, 
say, can withdraw credit balances with the cen -
tral bank as cash and use it to pay out commer -
cial bank money held by their depositors in the 
form of cash. The perception among users that Digital money 
should be 
universal  …zens worldwide and would promote eco-
nomic growth, international trade, global 
development and fi  nancial inclusion in 
equal measure. Against this backdrop, the 
Financial Stability Board (FSB) in October 
2020 presented the G20 with a roadmap 
listing concrete measures to improve inter-
national payments, a document which the 
Bundesbank was closely involved in draw-
ing up.6
These G20 activities are supported by the 
European Commission as well as private 
sector initiatives (for instance from SWIFT), 
which are intended to make payments 
across currency areas more effi   cient and 
more transparent. Support for the develop-
ment of a digital euro, as highlighted in the 
European Commission’s Retail Payments 
Strategy, also fi  ts in with the overall picture 
of policymakers increasingly taking a stra-
tegic view of payments. 6 See Financial Stability Board (2020).

also a website dedicated to remittance prices: https://
remittanceprices.worldbank.org/en

(mainly commercial banks) are able to hold deposits with

Money in programmable applications
Within DLT (distributed ledger technology) 
networks, services and money can be trans-
ferred only in tokenised form. Book money 
at commercial banks and balances on a 
central bank account may also be digital in 
the conventional meaning of the word, but 
they are not tokenised and cannot there-
fore be used directly by DLT in automated 
procedures. For that, money would have to 
be available in a programmable format as 
digital tokens. The settlement of textbook 
DLT use cases, where smart contracts take 
over process management and settlement 
–  machine- to- machine, internet- of- things 
or pay- per- use services, for instance – re-
quires the use of programmable forms of 
money.1 In this context, there is a distinc-
tion between programmable payments and 
programmable money.2
Programmable payments are defi  ned as 
transfers of money for which the time, 
amount and/ or type of transfer are deter-
mined by conditions that are specifi  ed in 
advance rather than being set ad hoc dur-
ing the payment process. In the simplest 
case, these may be regular payments exe-
cuted, for instance, by standing order. 
Going forward, they can, however, also be 
used to settle the cash leg of complex busi-
ness processes after ascertaining that pre-
defi  ned conditions have been met.
Programmable money, meanwhile, is de-
fi  ned as a digital form of money where 
users can program an inherent logic for 
conditional uses based on the attributes of 
the digital money itself. To really be able to 
speak of programmable money, the pro-
gram would have to be stored in the re-
spective “digital coin”. In many cases, the 
current need for money in programmable 
applications can be suffi   ciently met with a programmable payment that does not ne-
cessarily require programmable money.
1 Conceivable use cases: fully automated settlement 
between devices – for instance, an electronic vehicle 
independently pays the charging station at the car 
park; payments in the internet of things that are trig-
gered by interaction with the end user, for instance for 
partial consumption from an energy network; direct 
payment of an amount depending on consumption or 
use, say where a leased machine invoices the cost of 
the units used and subsequently processes the associ-
ated payment independently. See Deutsche Bundes-
bank (2020).
2 At the initiative of the Federal Ministry of Finance 
and the Bundesbank, a working group consisting of 19 
representatives of the real and the fi  nancial sector last 
year produced and published a position paper entitled 
“Money in programmable applications”. See Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2020).Deutsche Bundesbank

these three forms of money are equal in value 
is supported by the general legal framework, 
which guarantees the one- to- one convertibility 
of cash and book money at all times, and, on 
that basis, by the supervision of commercial 
banks and the deposit guarantee scheme. This 
is why no distinction is commonly made be -
tween one euro of commercial bank money 
and one euro of central bank money. That said, 
credit institutions that are able to do so tend to 
prefer the cashless settlement of financial mar -
ket transactions and other large-  value pay -
ments in default- free central bank money.
The aforementioned equivalence boosts the 
universality of money and lowers transaction 
costs for the economy. Ideally, new payment 
solutions should fit into this arrangement such 
that they are not only formally denominated in 
the same currency but can also be effectively 
converted into other forms with as little friction 
as possible, i.e. with no gains or losses in value.
New forms of money should be designed pri -
marily with their intended functionality in mind 
(form follows function13). Thus, they particu -
larly need to be measured against fundamental 
requirements resulting from money’s general 
functionality as a means of exchange, unit of 
account and store of value. Given that all man -
ner of goods are exchanged for, and bought 
with, one and the same medium, forms of 
money that offer vastly different functionalities 
as a means of exchange or store of value will 
be less functional and likely to be substituted 
by others. It is important to ensure that one 
euro remains one euro. The value of the euro 
needs to be the same, no matter what form it 
takes, where it is used and for what purpose. 
This basic requirement for a successful currency 
area is conditional on payment systems being 
efficient and secure.14
Efficiency in payments
The Bundesbank’s mandate15 in cashless pay -
ments boils down to compliance with the fun -damental principles of security and efficiency. 
To allow the frictionless use of money as a 
means of exchange, it must be possible to 
transfer that money with a maximum of effi -
ciency throughout the currency area, using sys -
tems whose security is assured at all times.
New forms of money can act to boost effi -
ciency levels in payments if they improve upon 
existing functionalities or support new ones or, 
quite simply, if they unleash fresh competitive 
pressure. There are high hopes, for instance, 
that the emergence of innovative payment 
media can improve cross- border payments and 
financial inclusion. There are also hopes of a 
more general nature concerning the use of 
money in distributed networks. Technically, 
however, the necessary consensus mechanisms 
mean that the simple act of sending money 
across distributed networks is slower and more 
costly than it is in centralised solutions.16 Digital 
money, by contrast, could simplify process 
chains in payments. Furthermore, digital – in 
the sense of tokenised – money supports the 
cash leg settlement of DLT- based procedures 
which themselves can drive down the cost of 
settling complex transactions. Viewed as a 
whole, then, the issuance of digital money 
could have a particularly beneficial impact on 
efficiency if it can be used in programmable ap -
plications.… and be

Guaranteeing security
Potential welfare gains from efficiency improve -
ments should not come at the expense of se -
curity, however. This applies to both the issu -
ance and circulation of new forms of money 
and even more so when novel, as yet untested 
technologies are deployed. Applications pro -
moting the digital transformation need to pro -
vide comprehensive protection in terms of in -
formation security and the resilience of IT sys -
tems. Where distributed networks are used, se -
curity standards need to be met by all agents. 
To safeguard the responsible governance of 
payment system operations and ensure compli -
ance with anti-  money laundering and anti-  
terrorist financing regimes, only administered 
and permissioned networks make sense where 
all the participants are clearly identifiable by the 
operator.
Innovative added value
Given the technological factors driving devel -
opments in the payments space that have been 
presented here, the range of functions pos -
sessed by digital money could go beyond those 
of cash and account- based commercial bank 
money, thereby serving as a useful complement 
to what they have to offer. To deliver innova -
tive added value, a new digital form of money 
could aim at being usable in programmable ap -
plications.17
As a concept, the way in which the infrastruc -
ture for digital money is designed needs to be 
conducive to innovation and not bound to any 
one technology. This approach will ensure its 
technical adaptability. With that in mind, inter -
operable standard solutions are preferable to 
stand- alone ones. While the latter can bring 
about improvements within their limited eco -
system in the short term, this would not result 
in any welfare gains for the European pay -
ments space as a whole.Implications within the realm 
of control
For their part, new forms of money cannot be 
permitted to jeopardise the functions served by 
existing ones. Their use as a medium of ex -
change, unit of account and store of value re -
quires a high degree of stability in terms of 
value, which is achieved through central banks’ 
stability- oriented monetary policy and accom -
panied by a stabilising effect on the financial 
system. Irrespective of the other properties that 
new forms of money may have, it is therefore 
crucial that monetary policy transmission re -
mains an effective process.
In particular, the regulatory implications of issu -
ing new forms of money need to be taken into 
consideration. The current monetary and pay -
ments system is a two- tier arrangement in 
which central banks and commercial banks 
control central bank money and book money, 
respectively.18 This division mitigates risk whilst 
at the same time protecting innovative drive, 
customer focus and efficient capital allocation. 
Should the provision of digital money be a 
solely public sector affair, it will probably not be 
possible to ensure either of these things to the 
same extent.
Conceivable approaches 
to digital money
Owing to new technical capabilities and the 
standards set for modern payment methods, a 
number of new solutions for the development 
of digital money are conceivable.19 These ap -
proaches have economic implications to vary -
ing degrees. As a rule, the first question to ask 
when innovating is not “How?” but “Why?”

forward, multiple payment solutions will prob -
ably continue to exist in parallel in a competi -
tive market. The implementation of such solu -
tions is likely to involve the use of various tech -
nical infrastructures, which need to be stand -
ardised and interoperable to the greatest extent 
possible.
Trigger solutions
Where transactions require payments to be 
programmable, a settlement medium is needed 
that can be used in digital networks. However, 
it is not strictly necessary to incorporate a 
settlement medium of this kind directly into 
these networks. Technical bridging solutions 
can make it possible for digital networks to 
interact with existing infrastructures. Linking 
them up in this way allows payments to be 
automatically initiated (or “triggered”), with 
confirmation of settlement likewise being auto -
mated. One major advantage of this kind of so -lution is that existing payment systems can be 
used even though they themselves are not de -
signed for programmable applications. Cash 
leg settlement would therefore meet all regula -
tory requirements more or less from the outset, 
and account and liquidity management would 
remain unchanged for users. The technical ad -
justments that have to be made to systems in 
order to implement trigger solutions are min -
imal at most. At the same time, there is no 
need to expand system access requirements. In 
addition, trigger solutions can be implemented 
relatively quickly and used in a wide range of 
applications. However, it would also be useful 
for existing payment systems to be accessible 
for trigger solutions at any time and every day 
(24/ 7).Trigger solutions

Like other stakeholders,20 the Bundesbank is ac -
tively working on a trigger solution (see the box 
on p.  67). Using trigger solutions, the digital 
network can be linked to central bank systems, 
making it possible to settle transactions in cen -
tral bank money, but also to privately operated 
clearing systems or directly to commercial 
banks’ account management systems.
Tokenised commercial bank 
money
Another option is tokenised commercial bank 
money, which would closely tie in with the 
existing delineation of roles in the current pay -
ments environment. Nowadays, transactions 
conducted by households and enterprises are 
settled for the most part in commercial bank 
money. In future, commercial banks could offer 
their book money in tokenised form in order to 
meet the standards set for modern payment 
methods. One advantage of this would be that 
the private sector would continue being able to 
develop efficient payment solutions for the cus -
tomer, while the division of tasks between the 
public and private sectors would not change in 
any substantial way. Solutions developed by in -
dividual banks or groups of banks that could 
deliver efficiency gains in a defined set of appli -
cations are one possible innovation here. Appli -
cations of this kind could, for example, take the 
form of internal settlement systems or applica -
tions for certain customer segments.21
If cross- bank applications are to become a real -
ity, it needs to be possible to convert one com -
mercial bank token for another. This poses a 
challenge, as interbank transfers would lead to 
a buildup of bilateral claims and liabilities and, 
consequently, exposures. The private sector 
would need to take a concerted and uniform 
approach in order to minimise risks, e.g. by 
means of intraday clearing for such trades. If a 
banking group jointly issues a commercial bank 
token, the party against which the holders of 
this token can assert their claims needs to be 
clearly defined. One conceivable solution to this would be to establish a legally independent 
entity that would assume the task of issuance 
and to which all holders of this tokenised book 
money could direct their claims. These could be 
secured by backing them with collateral or cen -
tral bank money.
Stablecoin applications
The concept of the “stablecoin”22 covers a var -
iety of models. Stablecoins are crypto tokens 
designed to minimise major fluctuations in 
value. They are therefore potentially more at -
tractive than other crypto tokens as a store of 
value and means of payment, and they are es -
pecially well suited for use in DLT networks. 
Given that applications can vary hugely in terms 
of underlying corporate structure (governance), 
business model, stability mechanism and tech -
nological basis, the economic implications 
would be highly diverse. In particular, the rights 
assured to consumers to redeem crypto tokens 
for conventional currencies differ from product 
to product. Users of stablecoins may incur 
credit, liquidity and exchange rate risk, amongst 
others. The main types of stablecoin that would 
come into consideration here are those de -
signed to be firmly pegged to a conventional 
currency and that are backed, for example, by 
bank deposits or securities in said currency.

National Bank as part of Project Helvetia (see Bank for 
International Settlements (2020a)).
21 Examples are the JP Morgan Coin, which bank custom -
ers can use to make payments, and a project run by Wells 
Fargo piloting internal settlement services.
22 Generally speaking, stablecoins are crypto tokens that 
are designed to have a stable value in relation to another 
unit of value. However, this does not always mean that 
they come with a guarantee of, or legal claim to, stability in 
terms of value. One way in which this stability is achieved 
is by backing them with assets or fiat currencies. Another 
option would be to use algorithms to adjust the supply of 
stablecoin units. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2019).Deutsche Bundesbank

The Bundesbank’s trigger solution
Blockbaster (blockchain- based settlement tech-
nology research) was the name given to a pro-
ject that saw the Bundesbank team up with 
Deutsche Börse to develop a trigger solution for 
testing purposes.1 This project involved experts 
from the two institutions using a trigger chain to 
build a technical bridge (interface) between a 
private DLT2 environment for securities (asset 
chain) and the Eurosystem’s real- time gross 
settlement (RTGS) system, TARGET2. Transac-
tions on the asset chain are able to use this inter-
face to automatically initiate (trigger) payments 
in TARGET2.
In the test itself, the German Finance Agency 
issued  a ten- year Federal bond (Bund) digitally in 
a DLT system. The trigger solution meant that it 
was possible for primary and secondary market 
transactions between multiple market partici-
pants to be settled in TARGET2 on a delivery- 
versus- payment (DvP) basis using smart con-
tracts.3
The proof of concept demonstrated the general 
functionality of a trigger solution for settling the 
cash leg of DLT- based use cases in a conven-
tional payment system. In monetary policy terms, the trigger solution is neutral because it 
does not change conditions for accessing central 
bank money and makes use of the existing pay-
ments infrastructure. The Bundesbank’s trigger 
solution could be used for asset chains of any 
kind, given the fact that it is a technology- 
neutral approach.
The project saw the creation of an interface be-
tween the conventional payments space and a 
DLT- based securities system. Two software mod-
ules, a trigger chain from the Bundesbank and a 
transaction coordinator from Deutsche Börse, 
connect TARGET2 and a DLT securities system. 
DvP settlement of the securities and central bank 
money only takes place when all the parties in-
volved have confi  rmed the transaction. This 
mode of settlement minimises counterparty risk 
for both the buyer and the seller.

major international currencies are also a con -
ceivable option.
At present, the role played by stablecoins in the 
payments space is practically non- existent, as 
the concepts are still at a relatively early stage 
of development. However, they have the po -
tential to become more commonplace. For this 
to happen, they would need to be adequately 
stable in value and offer users significant ad -
vantages over conventional payment proced -
ures, e.g. with regard to ease of use or cost. It 
must be ensured that providers of applications 
used widely in the European payments space 
are subject to regulation providing sufficient 
protection against potential risks in connection 
with the use of stablecoins. Whilst a legal 
framework for current accounts and payment 
systems is already in place, a regulatory frame -
work for crypto tokens, including stablecoins, 
is currently being discussed in the European 
Union: this is known as the MiCA Regulation.23
Stablecoins launched by large platform pro -
viders entering the market are a particularly big 
talking point. One of the best- known examples 
of a global stablecoin system is Facebook’s 
Diem (formerly Libra). Globally available stable -
coins could have broadly far- reaching implica -
tions for the financial markets – with repercus -
sions for the implementation and transmission 
of monetary policy as well as financial stability 
that are still unknown.24 In particular, stable -
coin systems could be vulnerable to runs. More 
specifically, it is conceivable that periods of 
stress would see customers buy or redeem sta -
blecoins on a large scale and in a short space of 
time. In response, it would be necessary to buy, 
sell or withdraw the assets, such as govern -
ment bonds or bank deposits, held to back the 
stablecoins. Depending on the scale of the run, 
this could have significant implications for the 
markets affected. However, it is also possible 
for market prices to be influenced by these sys -
tems even when they are operating normally. 
For example, the operator of a stablecoin sys -
tem could adjust the asset pool for the stable -
coin, i.e. buy or sell assets on a larger scale. Even the anticipation of such a response could 
lead to market price adjustments, which gives 
rise to the potential for speculative price move -
ments. If stablecoins were used as a store of 
value or for large-  value payments between 
credit institutions, particular attention would 
need to be paid to a legally enshrined one- to- 
one convertibility between them and euro 
book money in order to prevent the emergence 
of separate cash cycles. In this context, the risk 
of issuer default could likewise have implica -
tions for financial stability. Amendments and 
additions to the draft MiCA Regulation that 
would mitigate potential risks to financial sta -
bility in connection with stablecoins are cur -
rently being discussed. One particular area of 
interest in this regard is the regulation of the 
reserve funds backing stablecoins. Close co -
operation at the international level with 
standard- setting regulatory bodies and central 
banks, together with the careful monitoring of 
such systems, is also essential.25 Furthermore, 
regulatory issues that have yet to be resolved 
and implications regarding the stability mech -
anism need to be considered.26
Applications designed to facilitate high- value 
payments between credit institutions need to 
be highly resilient to service outages. Backing a 
stablecoin with central bank money would cre -
ate a close, but not perfect, substitute for exist -
ing central bank money. However, as long as 
the central bank makes no guarantees, it re -
mains commercial bank money. Even so, mar -
ket participants might think of stablecoins 
backed by central bank money as a substitute 
of sorts for central bank money. This is a source 
of risk because, unlike in the other RTGS sys -Risks and regu -

establishing legal certainty, MiCA’s objective is to safeguard 
financial stability, foster innovation in the field of crypto-  
assets, and ensure adequate protection for consumers and 
investors.

tems it operates, the central bank is unable to 
directly address disruptions by means of action 
such as liquidity measures. The central bank 
could also be exposed to reputational risk if dis -
ruptions to private systems were to damage 
confidence in central bank money. A high de -
gree of transparency would still be needed, as 
would an arrangement to prevent access to 
central bank money from being inadvertently 
expanded through access to a private system 
backed by central bank money. Expanding ac -
cess in this way could have implications for the 
financial system that are difficult to predict.
Central bank digital currency
In response to the challenges and demands 
posed by digital money, another subject to at -
tract increasing attention is CBDC. This topic is 
currently being explored in a number of coun -
tries (see the box on p. 70).
CBDC as a wholesale token
If the users of CBDC were to remain largely re -
stricted to banks and their current counterpar -
ties (wholesale CBDC), the structure of the fi -
nancial system would probably not change in 
any transformative way. Any negative implica -
tions for monetary policy implementation and 
financial stability, such as those potentially as -
sociated with retail CBDC of the kind described 
in the next section, might therefore be man -
ageable. The advantage of such a solution 
would be that wholesale payment systems 
offer 24/ 7 settlement and programmability. 
This could pave the way for a higher level of 
automation and process optimisation in secur -
ities settlement, in particular, especially through 
the tokenisation of securities, as is to be 
achieved, for example, with the act on digital 
securities in Germany or the planned DLT pilot 
regime for market infrastructures in the Euro -
pean Union. Furthermore, a wholesale token of 
this kind would be designed for integration 
into institutions’ liquidity management sys -tems, although a further component of non-  
cash central bank money besides deposits in 
central bank accounts would be tied up in the 
wholesale token, with potential implications 
for monetary policy implementation.
CBDC for the general public
Unlike the wholesale variant, a retail variant of 
central bank digital currency would provide for 
issuance to a broad set of users, including 
households. The issuance of retail CBDC is as -
sociated with numerous unresolved issues and 
risks and could have far- reaching consequences 
for the financial system and monetary policy 
purely because more parties would be using 
it.27 This is why a retail variant complementing 
other forms of money should be designed in 
such a way that it allows potential welfare 
gains to be achieved – through efficiency gains 
in payments, production and in financial mar -
kets, for example  – and, at the same time, 
keeps risks to a minimum.28
Considerations around a digital 
euro
In October 2020, the ECB published a detailed 
report on the potential issuance of a digital 
euro compiled by a high-  level working group 
of the Eurosystem.29 The considerations pre -
sented in this report relate to retail CBDC for 
the euro area. Alongside supporting the digital -
isation of the European economy, scenarios 
that could justify the introduction of a digital 
euro include a decline in the use of cash and a Wholesale 
variant  of CBDC 
could offer effi -
ciency gainsRetail variant 
harbours greater 
risks
Eurosystem 
starts investigat -
ing a digital 
euro
27 In addition, the introduction of CBDC may entail a clash 
of objectives. In a model- theoretical framework, Schilling 
et al. (2020) demonstrate a trilemma between price stabil -
ity, efficiency and financial stability when CBDC is issued. 
Various studies look into the potential trade- off between 
disintermediation and efficiency gains as a result of better 
fulfilment of the functions of money. See, inter alia, Andol -
fatto (2021), Chiu et al. (2019) and Keister and Sanches 
(2019).

Global trends in the fi  eld of central bank digital currency
The possibility of issuing central bank digital 
currency (CBDC) was fi  rst discussed among 
central banks on a larger scale by the Com-
mittee on Payments and Market Infrastruc-
tures (CPMI) in the 2017-18 period.1 The 
CPMI conducted an initial analysis of poten-
tial variants and the implications for central 
banks’ areas of activity. At the same time, a 
number of central banks began launching 
early CBDC- related projects.
Central banks’ activities in the area were 
catalysed by the publication in June 2019 of 
private market players’ plans to issue global 
stablecoins. Since then, more and more 
central banks have been engaging with the 
topic. Surveys conducted by the Bank for 
International Settlements revealed that 
64% of the central banks surveyed were ex-
ploring CBDC in 2017, while that fi  gure had 
risen to 86% by 2020.2 Most of these had 
embarked on setting up technical experi-
ments.
Retail CBDC, meant for use by the broader 
public, has garnered the most attention. 
The frontrunner in Europe is Sweden, where 
the Riksbank began work on the topic in 
2017.3 Looking beyond Europe, the People’s 
Bank of China has been working on plans 
to introduce a digital yuan since 2014. Ini-
tial real- world trials have already taken 
place in a selection of Chinese cities and are 
being continuously expanded.4
In addition to the conceptual studies being 
conducted on retail CBDC, some central 
banks are looking into the notion of whole-
sale CBDC, that is to say central bank digital 
currencies designed for a limited set of 
users. Their primary focus is on developing 
a medium which the fi  nancial sector can 
use to settle securities transactions. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) 
and the Swiss National Bank (SNB) are 
among the institutions exploring such pos-
sibilities. With Project Ubin, the MAS is 
aiming to develop a settlement system to 
boost Singapore’s economy and competi-
tiveness and position the fi  nancial centre as 
a future- proof blockchain hub.5 The SNB is 
collaborating with the clearing house SIX 
and the Bank for International Settlements 
on a project named Helvetia, concentrating 
on feasibility studies with a near- live set- up 
for settling tokenised assets in central bank 
money on distributed ledger technology 
(DLT) networks.6

broad take- up of stablecoins or foreign digital 
money. The report makes it clear that the digital 
euro outlined should – if introduced – operate 
as a complement to cash, not as a replace -
ment. Furthermore, a public consultation on 
the digital euro was launched. In parallel to 
this, the Eurosystem has initiated an experi -
mental phase in which various avenues for the 
potential implementation of a digital euro are 
being explored. The ECB Governing Council has 
not yet made a policy decision concerning a 
potential investigation phase and the subse -
quent introduction of a digital euro.
CBDC cannot replace cash
Although, in quantitative terms, the majority of 
central bank money is in cashless form, cash in 
the form of banknotes is currently the sole un -
restricted legal tender in the euro area,30 and 
the Eurosystem has committed itself to main -
taining cash as a means of payment.31 Digital 
money cannot fully substitute all of the func -
tions and benefits of cash, nor is it intended to. 
The fact that it is simple to use, can be used 
anywhere and is easily accessible are con -
sidered to be advantages of cash.32 It can be 
used securely by almost all population groups, 
requires no technical knowledge or set- up and 
its use does not depend on electronic infra -
structure. In addition, further typical features of 
cash, such as the complete anonymity of trans -
action parties and the fact that its provenance 
cannot be tracked33 – notwithstanding regula -
tory requirements, e.g. for the prevention of 
money laundering and terrorist financing – are 
also not fully realisable with digital money. 
Transfers of digital money – whether personal -
ised, anonymous or pseudoanonymous – are 
always recorded in an electronic register so 
that digital money cannot be copied or used 
multiple times. The register can either be oper -
ated and monitored centrally by an operator or 
in a decentralised manner via the network.34
The Eurosystem’s public consultation revealed 
privacy to be an important feature for users.35 The protection of personal data should there -
fore be a key concern when designing a digital 
euro. Unlike in the case of private providers 
who have commercial interests in data, a digital 
euro could be deliberately designed in such a 
way that the power over personal data remains 
fundamentally with the user. However, the 
issue of whether data can be used commer -
cially should not be confused with the question 
of whether payments can be settled in a com -
pletely anonymous way. It would be virtually 
impossible for an electronic payment instru -
ment that is fully anonymous like cash to be 
compatible with the existing regulatory require -
ments. Therefore, alongside individuals’ right 
to privacy and data protection, the design must 
also take into account public interest in pre -
venting money laundering and terrorism finan -
cing and the relevant regulatory standards.
Stringent security requirements 
for CBDC
Central bank money is subject to special secur -
ity requirements. The central bank makes sure 
that the banknotes and coins in circulation for 
cash payments are of high quality. In the Euro -
system, any transfers of non- cash central bank 
money, which is quantitatively more significant 
than the physical equivalent, are executed ex -
clusively within TARGET2 – a system developed, 
operated and overseen by the Eurosystem. This 
RTGS system, which settles transactions be -
tween participating banks in real time, is highly 
systemically important for the stability of the 
European financial system, not least given the 
settlement volumes involved. All of the Euro -
system’s monetary policy operations are settled Features of cash

using this system. The central bank is respon -
sible for the system and can intervene to stabil -
ise it at any time, which should prevent disrup -
tions and delays during settlement spilling over 
to the entire system and the connected ancil -
lary systems and having a destabilising effect. 
Central banks are tasked with developing, op -
erating and monitoring these systems in view 
of the significant role RTGS systems for settling 
individual payments in central bank money play 
in the stability of the financial system as a 
whole. Ultimately, problems experienced in 
central bank money settlement also jeopardise 
the reputation of the central bank and conse -
quently dent confidence in central bank money.
Principles for the introduction 
of CBDC
CBDC could have a significant influence on 
monetary policy implementation and transmis -
sion. Moreover, it could substantially expand 
the Eurosystem’s balance sheet, meaning 
greater exposure to financial risk. Structural 
changes in the wake of the introduction of 
CBDC could also have implications for financial 
stability. These implications could stem from, 
amongst other things, potential substitution 
away from commercial bank deposits into 
CBDC and an associated reduction in the bank -
ing system’s intermediation capacity, or from 
abrupt deposit shifts, for instance in the case of 
a system- wide crisis in confidence, if market 
participants’ behaviour is guided by the safety 
aspect of central bank money. Further examin -
ation into how significant these risks are and 
whether they can be avoided is required.36 The 
increased focus on CBDC has already prompted 
seven central banks and the Bank for Inter -
national Settlements to set out common foun -
dational principles that they wish to observe in 
the event of a potential introduction of CBDC. 
These include coexistence with cash, no disrup -
tion to monetary policy and financial stability, 
and the promotion of innovation and effi -
ciency.37Conclusion
With the discussion about digital money in the 
euro area increasingly centring around the po -
tential development of a digital euro, the ques -
tion arises as to how such an initiative could 
meet the general standards for digital money 
outlined in this article. The primary focus needs 
to be on striking a sensible balance between 
the benefits of wide use of this potential new 
form of the euro and its risks. From a user per -
spective, it is important that a means of pay -
ment be quick and straightforward for wide ac -
ceptance to be achieved.
Programmability plays a special role in this con -
text. Although a digital euro should be able to 
be used in conventional payment situations, 
such as at the point of sale, in e- commerce and 
ideally offline using wearable devices that even 
sections of the population who are not tech-  
savvy can operate, its innovative benefits would 
particularly come to the fore if a digital euro 
could be seamlessly integrated into DLT- based 
processes. However, it is also crucial to have a 
fundamental understanding of the potential 
risks and their transmission mechanisms and to 
take these into account through appropriate 
design choices.
The need for digital money for settling large-  
value transactions in securities trading should 
also not be neglected. It is important to moni -
tor this demand and to develop solutions that 
are either directly connected to central bank 
systems (triggered) or enable wholesale use of 
a digital euro.
Stakeholders, particularly in the banking indus -
try, should be involved in discussions about the 
potential design of a digital euro from the out -
set so as not to jeopardise the benefits offered 
by the existing division of tasks between com -
mercial and central banks. Another aspect that 
should be considered here is consolidating the Risks to monet -

Eurosystem’s discussions on the potential de -
sign of a digital euro and political support for 
private sector pan-  European payment solu -
tions, such as the European Payments Initiative.
It will be a matter of finding well- designed, se -
cure and convenient solutions. Otherwise nei -ther the ambitious political expectations re -
garding a digital euro as an alternative to pri -
vate sector stablecoins, nor the simultaneous 
responsibility of the central bank for the stabil -

associations), money market funds, and the European Central Bank and national central
banks (the Eurosystem).  1 Source: ECB.  2 In Germany, only savings deposits.

portfolios of securities issued by MFIs in the euro area.  4 In Germany, bank debt
securities with maturities of up to one year are classed as money market paper.5 Excluding liabilities arising from securities issued.  6 After deduction of inter-MFI
participations.  7 The German contributions to the Eurosystem's monetary aggregates

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).

* The effective exchange rate corresponds to the weighted external value of the
currency concerned. The method of calculating the indicators of the German economy's
price competitiveness is consistent with the procedure used by the ECB to compute the
effective exchange rates of the euro. A decline in the figures implies an increase in
competitiveness. The weights are based on trade in manufactured goods and services.
For more detailed information on methodology and weighting scale, see the website of
the Deutsche Bundesbank (https://www.bundesbank.de/content/796162).  1 ECB
calculations are based on the weighted averages of the changes in the bilateral
exchange rates of the euro vis-à-vis the currencies of the following countries: Australia,
Bulgaria, Canada, China, Croatia, Czechia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan,
Norway, Poland, Romania, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United
Kingdom and the United States. Where current price and wage indices were not avai-lable, estimates were used.  2 ECB calculations. Includes countries belonging to the
group EER-19 and additionally Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Iceland, India,
