Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The German economy is likely to have grown 
again in the final quarter of 2018, albeit only 
modestly. Growth probably did not return to 
the robust pace of the first half of 2018 follow -
ing the setback in the third quarter as had ini -
tially been expected. This is primarily attribut -
able to disappointing developments in industry. 
Output in the automotive industry is probably 
returning to normal only very gradually after 
the introduction of a new emissions test pro -
cedure (Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles 
Test Procedure: WLTP) caused extensive pro -
duction stoppages during the third quarter. 
Economic indicators do suggest that the manu -
facture of motor vehicles might be stepped up 
again soon, with orders received, in particular, 
having experienced a significant recovery. Fur -
thermore, towards the end of the period under 
review, the number of new motor vehicle regis -
trations in Germany was roughly back up to 
the second quarter level again. Irrespective of 
this, however, data provided by the German 
Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) 
show that the seasonally adjusted number of 
passenger cars produced in December was 
only marginally higher than the November fig -
ure and still considerably below the second 
quarter’s level. Furthermore, in other manufac -
turing sectors, output experienced a broad-  
based and steep decline in November. A signifi -
cant drop in industrial output can therefore 
now also be expected for the fourth quarter as 
a whole. By contrast, positive stimuli will prob -
ably have been provided by private consump -
tion given the continuing excellent labour mar -
ket situation and substantial wage growth. This 
is suggested by the strong increase in retail 
sales in November.
According to provisional figures released by the 
Federal Statistical Office, real gross domestic product increased by 1.5% in 2018 (also 1.5% 
after calendar adjustment). Growth in aggre -
gate output thus weakened noticeably as com -
pared with the robust acceleration of 2.2% (as 
much as 2.5% after calendar adjustment) in the 
previous year. On the output side, this was 
mainly attributable to lower growth in manu -
facturing. Another factor were the automotive 
industry’s production stoppages in the third 
quarter, which were responsible for the decline 
in economic output in the third quarter. On the 
demand side, much more moderate growth in 
German exports, in particular, had an impact.
Industry
Industrial output saw a steep decline in Novem-
ber 2018, falling by 1¾% on the month in sea -
sonally adjusted terms. On an average of Octo -
ber and November, it was significantly down 
on the third quarter (-1¼%). The downward 
movement affected a wide range of sectors in 
the period under review. Even the automotive 
sector, which had already been under heavy 
strain during the third quarter on account of 
the WLTP crisis, experienced another contrac -
tion of output (-¾%). The weak level of pro -
duction in this industrial sector is thus likely to 
drag on longer than initially expected, as is also 
suggested by the VDA data already available 
for December. According to these data, the 
seasonally adjusted number of manufactured 
passenger cars was slightly higher than in pre -
vious months, but still distinctly below the level 
in the first half of 2018. On an average of Octo-
ber and November, there was a marked decline 
of ½% in the production of capital goods over -
all compared with the third quarter. Producers 
of intermediate goods suffered an even larger 
drop in production (-1%). The 5% reduction in 
output in the consumer goods industry stood 
out, in particular. This was due to an excep -
tional development in the pharmaceutical in -
dustry, however, where production was cut sig -Only slight

nificantly (-21¼%) following a prolonged steep 
rise.1 Excluding pharmaceutical products, the 
manufacture of consumer goods stagnated.
New orders received by German industry fell 
significantly in November and were down by 
1% on the previous month in seasonally ad -
justed terms. Looking at October and Novem -
ber together, however, they were up distinctly 
by ½% on the previous quarter. In terms of 
geographic origin, the increase in orders was 
attributable mainly to orders from abroad, with 
orders from both the euro area and from non- 
euro area countries recording similarly steep 
growth (+2% in each case). The fairly volatile 
inflow of other transport equipment orders 
was the main factor behind the buoyant de -
mand from the euro area, however. Excluding 
this factor, German manufacturers reported 
markedly fewer additional orders from the euro 
area (-1%). Overall, the volume of new orders 
from within Germany dropped perceptibly 
(-1½%). Broken down by industry, only the cap -
ital goods sector experienced a significant in -
crease in new orders (+3%). However, this was 
solely due to the automotive sector, which saw 
catch- up effects (+7%) following the WLTP-  
related  downturn. By contrast, the inflow of 
orders in this sector stagnated excluding the 
automotive industry. Furthermore, new orders 
for intermediate goods and consumer goods 
were down significantly on the previous quar -
ter (by 2¾% and 2% respectively).
A sharp decline in nominal industrial turnover 
was recorded in November 2018. After sea -
sonal adjustment, the month- on- month de -
crease of 2¼% was even slightly stronger than 
that of industrial output and on an average of 
October and November, turnover was still sig -
nificantly down on the previous quarter (-¾%).

only domestic sales figures were positive,

engin eering and automotive sectors. By con -
trast, German enterprises’ sales fell significantly 
in the euro area and there was an even stronger 
decline in non- euro area countries. This devel -
opment was again driven mainly by the mech -
anical engin eering and automotive sectors, al -
though the trend went in the opposite direc -
tion as compared to Germany. Turnover in 
intermediate and capital goods was down dis -
tinctly on the whole, while sales of consumer 
goods were only slightly lower. In line with this, 
nominal goods exports in November 2018 de -
clined slightly on the month in seasonally ad -
justed terms (-¼%). Looking at October and 
November in aggregate, however, they ex -
ceeded the average of the third quarter (+½%), 
and there was also a slight increase even in 
price- adjusted terms (+¼%). After seasonal ad -
justment, nominal imports of goods in Novem -
ber recorded a steep decrease on the month 
(-1½%). On an average of October and Novem -
ber, they were slightly down on the third quar -
ter (-¼%). After adjustment for price effects, 
however, the contraction was significantly 
stronger (-1%). This was attributable to the 
sharp increase in prices for energy imports dur -
ing this period.
Construction industry
Construction output fell steeply in November 
2018, contracting by 1¾% on the previous 
month in seasonally adjusted terms.2 On an 
average of October and November, there was 
nonetheless a slight increase of ¼% on the pre -
vious quarter. Output in the finishing trades 
rose significantly (+¾%), whilst activity in the 
main construction sector was down slightly on 
the third quarter (-¼%). Irrespective of the 
rather  subdued growth dynamics of late, the 
construction sector in Germany continues to 
boom. New orders received by the main con -
struction sector in October 2018 –  data are 
available up to this date – increased strongly 
compared with the average of the third quarter 
in seasonally adjusted terms. Moreover, accord-
ing to the ifo Institute, the utilisation of con -struction equipment remained at an exception -
ally high level in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Labour market
The labour market is still in excellent condition. 
The Federal Statistical Office did adjust the 
employ ment level slightly down for September 
and October. Employment growth was still 
solid, however, and continued to increase at a 
similar rate in November. The total number of 
persons in work in the reporting month rose by 
a seasonally adjusted 34,000 compared with 
October 2018. Employment was up by 483,000 
persons or 1.1% on the previous month 
although  the year- on- year figure declined 
recently  . Employment subject to social security 
contributions continued to show strong 
growth, even outpacing total employment. By 
contrast, as throughout 2018, there was a 
decline  in both the number of self- employed 
persons and of persons working exclusively in 
low- paid part- time jobs. Overall, the indicators 
for labour demand remained at the expansion -
ary level reached. The greater labour market 
tightness is reflected, amongst other things, in 
the further increase in the average time it takes 
to fill vacancies.
Unemployment continued to decline markedly 
at the end of 2018. In December, 2.26 million 
persons were registered as unemployed with 
the Federal Employment Agency, 14,000 fewer 
than in November in seasonally adjusted terms. 
The decrease was entirely attributable to a 
drop in the number of unemployed persons 
receiv ing the basic welfare allowance. The un -
employment rate remained at the low level of 
5.0%. The number of unemployed persons was 
down by 175,000 on the year. On an annual Steep decline in

2 It should be noted, however, that the reported construc -
tion output was subject to heavy revision. This is attribut -
able to a significant revision of output data for finishing 
trades, which affected every month since July 2018. How -
ever, this is related to a change in the weighting base used 
for deflating. The revised numbers are therefore not com -
parable with the data for earlier periods until their weight -
ing base, too, has been adjusted.Deutsche Bundesbank

average in 2018, 2.34 million persons were 
registered as unemployed, 193,000 fewer than 
the annual average in 2017. The unemploy -
ment barometer of the Institute for Employ -
ment Research (IAB) was down, but unemploy -
ment is nonetheless likely to drop further in the 
next three months.
Prices
Crude oil prices declined again significantly in 
December on the back of high worldwide pro -
duction and concerns about global oil demand. 
They were 14% lower than in November and as 
a result were down on the year for the first 
time since mid-2017. Crude oil prices recovered 
slightly in the first half of January. As this report 
went to press, a barrel of Brent crude oil cost 
US$60. The premium on crude oil futures was 
US$¼ for deliveries 6 months ahead, with no 
significant discount for 12- month deliveries.
Import prices were down distinctly in Novem -
ber due to a steep decline in energy prices. By 
contrast, prices of other goods were un -
changed. Domestic industrial producer prices 
were nonetheless up moderately, both includ -
ing and excluding energy, with higher transport 
costs due to low water levels on the Rhine and 
other rivers probably also playing their part. 
The year-  on- year change for imports fell to 
3.1% and for producer prices remained un -
changed at 3.3%.
After seasonal adjustment, consumer prices 
(HICP) were down by a significant 0.3% in 
Decem ber. Energy became significantly cheaper 
but lower crude oil prices would have sug -
gested an even stronger decline. Food prices 
were also somewhat lower. By contrast, prices 
of industrial goods excluding energy rose 
slightly. There was a somewhat stronger in -
crease in the cost of services, mainly due to 
package holidays. Rents continued to rise 
moder  ately. Annual headline HICP infla tion 
decreased  from +2.2% to +1.7% (CPI was like -
wise down to +1.7% from +2.3%). Excluding energy and food, however, it rose from +1.2% 
to +1.4%. At +1.9% on average in 2018, the 
headline rate was slightly higher than in the 
previous year (+1.7%) due to the sustained 
steep increase in energy prices but also of 
food.3
Securities markets
Bond market
In November 2018, issuance in the German 
bond market stood at €95.5 billion in gross 
terms (previous month: €111.1 billion). After 
deducting redemptions, which were lower 
than in the previous month, and taking ac -
count of changes in issuers’ holdings of their 
own debt securities, the outstanding volume of 
domestic bonds grew by €13.3 billion. Foreign 
debt securities worth €5.5 billion net were sold 
in the German market. The funds raised from 
sales of domestic and foreign debt securities in 
the German market therefore amounted to 
€18.7 billion.
The public sector issued bonds totalling €7.1 
billion net in the reporting month. On balance, 
these were placed solely by central govern -
ment, which issued mainly Treasury discount 
paper (“Bubills”: €3.7 billion), Federal notes 
(“Bobls”: €2.3 billion) and two- year Federal 
Treasury notes (“Schätze”: €2.0 billion). Mean -
while, there were net redemptions of federal 
state bonds totalling €0.8 billion on balance.
The outstanding volume of debt securities is -
sued by domestic credit institutions grew by 
€6.8 billion in November, following an increase 
of €10.7 billion in the preceding month. Ultim -
ately, the main instruments issued were other 
bank debt securities (€4.5 billion), but there 
was also smaller- scale issuance of debt secur -
ities of specialised credit institutions and mort -
gage Pfandbriefe (€1.4 billion and €1.3 billion 
respectively).Clear decline in

German enterprises scaled back their capital 
market debt by €0.7 billion net in the reporting 
month. On balance, liabilities were redeemed 
mainly by non- financial corporations, while in -
surance corporations were the chief net issuers 
of bonds.
Among the various investor groups, the main 
buyers in November were foreign investors on 
balance; they added German bonds worth €7.9 
billion net to their portfolios. The Bundesbank 
acquired debt securities in the net amount of 
€3.9 billion, for the most part under the Euro -
system’s asset purchase programmes. Domes -
tic non- banks increased their holdings of bonds 
by €3.8 billion, favouring foreign securities. 
German credit institutions purchased debt 
secur ities with a net value of €3.2 billion, strik -
ing a more or less even balance between do -
mestic and foreign securities.
Equity market
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
placed €0.2 billion worth of new shares in the 
German equity market (October: €1.2 billion). 
By contrast, the outstanding volume of foreign 
equities in the German market dropped by 
€3.4 billion in the same period. On balance, 
foreign investors were the sole purchasers of 
equities (€2.4 billion), while both domestic 
non- banks and credit institutions trimmed their 
share portfolios by €4.0 billion and €1.5 billion 
respectively in net terms.
Mutual funds
In November, domestic mutual funds sold 
shares totalling €11.1 billion net in the German 
market (previous month: €6.7 billion). In net 
terms, fresh funds were injected chiefly into 
specialised funds reserved for institutional in -
vestors (€9.4 billion). Among the asset classes, 
mixed securities- based funds attracted the 
most inflows (€3.6 billion), though they were 
also recorded by funds of funds (€2.0 billion), open- end real estate funds (€1.9 billion) as well 
as equity funds and bond- based funds (€1.8 
billion each). Foreign mutual funds placed 
shares worth €0.6 billion in the German market 
in the reporting month. On balance, domestic 
non- banks were the sole purchasers, adding a 
net €13.2 billion worth of mutual fund shares 
to their portfolios. Domestic credit institutions 
and foreign investors sold mutual fund shares 
worth €1.3 billion and €0.1 billion net respect -
ively.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €21.4 billion in November 2018. The result 
was €2.6 billion up on the level of the previous 
month. This was attributable to the increase in 
the balance of invisible current transactions, 
which comprise services as well as primary and 
secondary income.Fall in enter -

At €20.0 billion in the reporting month, the 
surplus in the goods account was virtually at 
the previous month’s level (€20.1 billion). 
Goods imports in foreign trade fell more sharply 
than goods exports, but there was also a sig -
nificant decline in supplementary trade items 
on the export side.
A surplus of €1.4 billion in invisible current 
transactions was recorded in November, fol -
lowing a deficit of €1.2 billion in October. The 
main reason for the turnaround was that the 
decrease in the services account deficit was 
stronger than the increase in the secondary in -
come deficit. The deficit in the services account 
shrank by €3.4 billion to €0.3 billion, which 
was chiefly down to the usual seasonal de -
crease in travel expenditure. Moreover, net 
receipts  in primary income rose by €0.5 billion 
to €7.4 billion. Income grew at a somewhat 
faster pace than expenditure, with investment 
income playing a particular role. In contrast to 
this, the deficit in secondary income widened 
by €1.3 billion to €5.6 billion, mainly due to 
higher payments from sectors outside general 
government to non- residents.
Cross- border portfolio investment in Germany 
continued to be shaped by slightly subsiding 
global economic growth and political uncer -
tainties in November. All in all, there were net 
capital imports totalling €2.9 billion (October: 
net capital imports of €13.8 billion). Portfolio 
investment by foreign investors in Germany 
resulted   in net inflows of capital (€9.4 billion). 
This was due mainly to purchases of debt 
secur ities (€7.9 billion), particularly bonds. For -
eign investors also added German shares to 
their portfolios (€1.7 billion), but parted with 
investment fund shares (€0.1 billion). Resident 
investors acquired foreign securities worth €6.5 
billion net, purchasing debt securities (€5.5 bil -
lion), investment fund shares (€0.6 billion) and 
shares (€0.4 billion).
Direct investment generated net capital im -

enter prises strongly increased their direct in -
vestment in Germany (€18.1 billion), mainly in 
the form of intra- group lending (€13.4 billion). 
Loans from foreign affiliates to their German 
parent companies played a significant role in 
this. Foreign owners also boosted the equity 
capital they provided to German branches by 
€4.8 billion. Domestic enterprises’ foreign dir -
ect investment resulted in net outflows (€3.1 
billion). This was chiefly due to the additional 
provision of equity capital (€5.7 billion), with 
reinvested earnings playing a key role. In the 
same period, German parent companies scaled 
back their lending to foreign affiliates by €2.6 
billion. This related to financial credit only.
Other statistically recorded investment – which 
comprises loans and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank de -
posits and other investments – registered net capital exports of €31.0 billion in November, up 
from €16.7 billion one month previously. The 
banking system as a whole saw outflows of 
€20.8 billion. Monetary financial institutions 
(excluding the Bundesbank) accounted for the 
largest share of this, at €17.4 billion. The Bun -

The impact of an interest rate 
normalisation  on the private non- financial 
sector in the euro area from a balance 
sheet perspective
In the wake of the global financial and economic crisis and of the European debt crisis, some 
sizeable balance sheet constraints became apparent in the private non-  financial sector. House -
holds and non- financial corporations responded to these by scaling back their debt and curbing 
their expenditure. The standard and non- standard monetary policy measures taken by the Euro -
system pushed down interest rates, helping to significantly reduce the interest burden on the 
private non- financial sector and ease balance sheet restrictions. This article explores whether and 
to what extent the balance sheet indicators of the euro area’s private non- financial sector – meas -
ured on the basis of net interest income and debt service – could deteriorate again if interest rates 
were to return to normal, and whether this might result in any significant negative repercussions 
for the real economy.
The research suggests that, all in all, balance sheet indicators are only likely to deteriorate mod -
erately as a result of an interest rate normalisation. This is mainly because debt levels in a number 
of sectors and countries have been pared back significantly over the last few years and, in con -
trast to the last interest rate tightening phase (2005-08), are not expected to rise again markedly 
over the next few years. At the same time, compared with previous phases of interest rate 
increases and decreases, a considerably more gradual rise in interest rates is anticipated.
Empirical analyses suggest that a rise in debt service ratios, in particular, could be accompanied 
by a persistent decline in household consumption and investment by non- financial corporations. 
Given that the changes to the balance sheet indicators derived from the simulations are rather 
modest and that interest rates will probably return to normal in a favourable economic environ -
ment, this should not, in itself, have any major impact on the real economy.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
The global financial and economic crisis and 
the European debt crisis highlighted the rele -
vance of the private non- financial sector’s bal -
ance sheet indicators to real economic growth 
in the euro area. Reduced earnings as a result 
of the crises and a revaluation of assets led to 
sizeable balance sheet constraints in some 
cases. Households and non- financial corpor -
ations responded by scaling back their debt 
and curbing their consumption and invest -
ment.1 However, the lower interest rates stem -
ming from the Eurosystem’s expansionary 
monetary policy significantly reduced the inter -
est burden on the private non-  financial sector 
in the euro area. This eased balance sheet con -
straints and ultimately supported growth in 
consumption and investment.
This article explores whether and to what ex -
tent balance sheet indicators in the private 
non- financial sector –  measured here on the 
basis of net interest income and debt service – 
could deteriorate again if interest rates were to 
return to normal. Because changes in the euro 
area aggregate mask sometimes significant dif -
ferences between countries, we examine the 
four large Member States (Germany, France, 
Italy and Spain) individually in addition to the 
euro area as a whole. The main findings can be 
summarised as follows.
– Overall, an interest rate normalisation is not 
likely to cause any serious deterioration in 
the private non- financial sector’s balance 
sheet indicators.
– This is first and foremost due to the progress 
made in deleveraging in individual sectors 
and countries since the height of the Euro -
pean debt crisis and the anticipation of a 
very gradual normalisation of interest rates.
– Potential balance sheet constraints resulting 
from an interest rate normalisation are un -
likely to be accompanied by a considerable 
slowdown in the real economy.The following section explains in detail how 
these results were obtained. First, the role of 
balance sheet indicators in monetary policy 
transmission is discussed. Stylised empirical cor -
relations are then drawn between the balance 
sheet indicators and real economic variables for 
the euro area. The article also provides an over -
view of developments in the balance sheet in -
dicators during the period of monetary policy 
easing. Finally, scenario analyses showing the 
potential path of the balance sheet indicators 
under various interest rate normalisation scen -
arios are presented and then used to derive 
possible macroeconomic implications.
The role of interest income 
and wealth effects in 
monetary  policy transmission
Conceptual considerations
Theoretical studies on monetary policy trans -
mission examine how a monetary policy-  
induced change in interest rates affects the 
consumption and investment decisions of the 
private non- financial sector. These studies 
distinguish   between direct and indirect effects 
– direct effects encompass the immediate 
response  of consumption and investment to a 
changing interest rate environment, while in -
direct effects have an impact via the interaction 
between changes in supply and demand in the 
different sub- markets of the economy. One ex -
ample of an indirect effect of this kind would 
be a reduction in wage income caused by an 
increase in unemployment, which in turn 
dampens consumer spending.2 Direct effects 
typically focus on substitution and profitability 
aspects. The idea is that changes in interest Recent crises

rates influence the relative attractiveness of 
current consumption and the profitability of in -
vestments. In addition to this, direct effects via 
changes in interest and investment income also 
emerge as a key factor in the transmission of 
monetary policy (see the chart above). These 
have become a focal point of the theoretical 
debate, especially in the wake of the global 
financial  and economic crisis.3
The following section focuses exclusively on 
the direct effects caused by a change in income 
associated with financial assets and liabilities. 
These income effects are measured at the 
macroeconomic level, mostly on the basis of 
net interest income and debt service. Net inter -
est income is the difference between interest 
earnings and interest payments. As well as 
interest payments, debt service also includes 
the redemption payments associated with 
debt.
The direction and magnitude of these income 
effects depend on the structure of the financial 
balance sheets of the agents involved. With re -
gard to net interest income, it is interest rate-  
sensitive assets and liabilities in the private sec -
tor portfolio that are particularly important.4 In 
the case of net borrowers, which non- financial 
corporations usually are, net interest income 
goes down in an environment of rising interest rates if interest payments increase more sharply 
than interest earnings over matching interest 
rate fixation periods. This reduces the amount 
of internal funds available to non- financial cor -
porations, which in itself tends to weaken in -
vestment activity.5 The argument is similar for 
households with relatively high levels of debt. 
Here, too, a rising interest rate leads to higher 
interest payments and a drop in disposable in -
come. This is particularly pronounced for loans

sion. Because empirical studies for the euro area show that

ther consideration is given to them here. For more informa -

with floating rates. By contrast, net interest in -
come increases for households with large 
stocks of interest- bearing assets and debt levels 
that are low or that characteristically consist of 
fixed rate loans.
While net interest income takes into account 
both assets and liabilities, debt service focuses 
on the interest- bearing liabilities of the private 
non- financial sector. Interest payments, which 
together with redemption payments equate to 
the debt service, are particularly heavily influ -
enced by the interest rate level and therefore 
the monetary policy stance.6 A higher debt ser -
vice implies that a growing proportion of dis -
posable income will have to be used to service 
interest and redemption payments, limiting the 
scope for consumption and investment spend -
ing.
In turn, the sensitivity of consumption and in -
vestment behaviour in response to changes in 
net interest income or debt service depends 
largely on financial frictions at the household 
and corporate level. These include liquidity and 
financing constraints, in particular. High pay -
ment obligations in relation to the stock of li -
quid assets mean that agents respond much 
more strongly to temporary income fluctu -
ations via their current consumption and their 
investment, as they do not have sufficient liquid  
assets to use as a buffer.7
Based on these considerations, direct income 
effects are particularly likely to have a signifi -
cant impact in cases where economic agents 
finance illiquid assets through borrowing, in -
cluding, for instance, purchases of real estate 
by households or fixed assets by companies. 
Whether loan contracts have a variable rate of 
interest also has a bearing.8 A rising interest 
rate level will then translate significantly faster 
into a higher current interest burden, eating 
into the resources available for consumption 
and investment. If the new interest rate envir -
onment also entails a general reduction in asset 
prices and thus the value of the assets under -
lying the debt contracts as collateral, economic agents’ levels of indebtedness may also in -
crease to a burdensome or even unsustainable 
level. A debt overhang of this kind further de -
creases willingness to spend owing to the need 
for deleveraging.9

Member States –  Germany, France, Italy and 
Spain – to show how macroeconomic variables 
might respond to a deterioration in these bal -

sumed that net interest income declines and 
the debt service ratio increases.10 Real invest -

are used as real economic indicators and thus 
dependent variables. The impulse- response

time following a one- time deterioration of the 
balance sheet indicators amounting to one 
standard deviation. The chart above presents 
the results of the empirical analysis.

mated in which the dependent variable is continuously 
shifted further into the future. The parameter estimated in 
this way for each point in time for the relevant explanatory

sector): yi,t+h = αi,h + βh indicatori,t-1 + γh Xi,t-1 + εi,t+h.

for up to eight quarters. At the same time, it ensures that 
the projections are based on the same data base, regard -

fects on the real economy. These materialise in 
the context of net interest income, mostly in 
the form of a clear, but only short- term, decline 
in investment growth by non- financial corpor -
ations. The response of household consump -
tion is also negative, but tends to be statistic -
ally insignificant. Furthermore, an increase in 
debt service ratios, in particular, appears to be 
linked to perceptible and sustained negative ef -
fects. This is true for both non- financial corpor -
ations and households. The main reason for 
the high level of persistence is probably that, as 
experience has shown, the primary response to 
an increase in the debt service ratio is an ex -
tended period of deleveraging, hampering eco -
nomic growth in the long term.12 On the 
whole, the results suggest that balance sheet 
constraints, linked to negative feedback effects 
for the real economy, could first and foremost 
appear in the form of a higher debt service 
ratio.
The balance sheet position 
of the private non- financial 
sector in the euro area
The analysis above has shown that changes in 
balance sheet indicators such as net interest in -
come and debt service can have an impact on 
the real economy. Stylised information on the private non-  financial sector’s balance sheet 
situation can be obtained using data from the 
financial accounts and national accounts. As 
well as the euro area as a whole, the four large 
Member States of Germany, France, Italy and 
Spain are also considered in the following ana -
lyses.
The chart above shows that, in absolute terms, 
the interest- bearing assets of households sig -
nificantly exceed the corresponding liabilities in 
all the countries analysed.13 This means that

13 According to the European System of Accounts 2010 
(ESA 2010), deposits, debt securities, loans and other 
accounts  receivable/ payable are interest- bearing. Since the 
latter are subject to a certain degree of statistical uncer -
tainty, they are excluded from the following analysis. Here, 
the definition of the debt instruments used to calculate the 
debt service ratios also includes loans and debt securities. 
Deposits are not relevant because they do not play a role in 
the external financing of the private non- financial sector. In 
addition to this, there are non- interest- bearing assets and 
liabilities such as shares and other equity, as well as claims 
on insurance corporations. Although a guaranteed interest

tive. Across the countries, interest- bearing net 
financial assets are particularly high in Italy. 
Interest- bearing assets are therefore likely to 
benefit disproportionately from a rise in the 
interest rate level. The situation is different for 
non- financial corporations, which have signifi -
cantly more interest- bearing liabilities. Again, 
Italy stands out here with a large difference 
between  the two figures. Thus, net financial 
assets as relevant to interest income are nega -
tive in all the countries analysed, meaning that 
a return to normal interest rates would prob -
ably have a larger impact on liabilities. Interest- 
bearing assets account for just over 30% and 
40% of the total financial assets (including 
non- interest- bearing assets) of non- financial 
corporations and households respectively. The 
liabilities of households are almost exclusively 
interest- bearing, whereas those of non-  
financial corporations are predominantly non-  
interest- bearing.
The situation described at the aggregate sec -
toral level may conceal heterogeneous devel -
opments within the sectors. For instance, at 
the individual household level in the euro area, 
it is evident that, in the event of an interest rate 
normalisation, households with lower net 
wealth or income are especially likely to experi -
ence a heavier interest payment burden owing 
to the composition of their portfolios (see the 
box on pp. 20 ff.).
As well as the interaction between interest-  
bearing assets and liabilities, other aspects also 
influence how changes in the general interest 
rate environment affect net interest income and 
debt service. The maturities of deposits and 
debt instruments as well as the fixed- term inter -
est rates for loans are particularly important in 
this context. They determine interest rate levels 
and how quickly changes in interest rates are 
transferred to the various financial instruments. 
A glance at the balance sheets of the private 
non- financial sector in the countries analysed 
shows that the maturities of interest- bearing 
assets generally tend to be shorter, while those 
for interest- bearing liabilities tend to be com -paratively long. Taking into account the matur -
ity structure, a return to normal interest rates 
would probably therefore tend to be transmit -
ted more quickly to assets than to liabilities.
There is an important difference between 
households and non-  financial corporations in 
terms of the interest rate fixation periods for 
bank loans. For floating rate loans, interest pay -
ments are usually linked to a short- term market 
benchmark that adapts rapidly to changes in 
the monetary policy stance.14 With longer 
interest rate fixation periods, however, changes 
in the interest rate level will not be felt until an 
expiring loan agreement is replaced by a new 
one. This may delay the effect on borrowers’ 
interest payment obligations. Because a larger 
share of floating rate loans is granted to non-  
financial corporations than to households in 
the euro area as a whole, generally speaking, 
an interest rate hike would probably tend to 
become evident more quickly on the liabilities 
side for non- financial corporations. At the same 
time, at the country level, the repercussions 
would probably be felt more promptly overall 
in Italy and Spain, which have a larger share of 
floating rate loans, than in Germany or France.15
Developments in net interest 
income
Net interest income is the difference between 
the interest income generated by the interest-  
bearing assets and the interest payments re -
lated to the interest- bearing liabilities. Changes 
in this variable can be broken down into a pure 
interest rate effect and a portfolio effect.16 The Clear

The interest rate exposure of euro area households
A change in the policy interest rate, to the 
extent it is passed through to deposit and 
lending rates, has a direct effect on the 
amount of interest received or paid by 
households. And since interest- bearing 
assets and liabilities are distributed differ-
ently across households, these households 
can be affected very differently by an inter-
est rate change. The composition of house-
holds’ portfolios in terms of interest- bearing 
assets and maturity structure determines 
the extent to which households’ interest in-
come fl  ows are affected by interest rate 
changes in a given time interval.
A recent study by Tzamourani (2019) esti-
mates the interest rate exposure of euro 
area households.1 The metric used is the 
unhedged interest rate exposure (URE), 
i.e. the difference between maturing assets 
and liabilities, as defi  ned by Auclert (2019).2 
It is a welfare metric, which captures the 
extent to which households respond to 
changes in real interest rates and refl  ects 
the direct gains and losses in their net inter-
est income after such a change.
Using survey data, the URE  for one year 
can be defi  ned for each household i as
URE i=YiCi+AiLi,
where Yi stands for household income, Ci 
for consumption, Ai for maturing assets 
and Li for maturing liabilities in that year.
The URE  is thus the resource fl  ow available 
for investment, or the amount to be fi  -
nanced, over the year, and so in effect rep-
resents the amount that is exposed to inter-
est rate changes. Households with a posi-
tive URE, with typically many investments 
in short- term instruments, such as deposits, would initially benefi  t from an increase in 
interest rates (assuming constant infl  ation). 
On the other hand, households with a 
negative URE, with typically adjustable- 
rate mortgages (ARMs) and smaller invest-
ments in deposits, would lose from an 
interest rate increase.
The study uses the Eurosystem’s Household 
Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS), 
which provides representative and detailed 
data on assets, debt, income and consump-
tion of euro area households.3 Based on 
these data, Tzamourani estimates in her 
study the URE  for the euro area as a whole 
and for the individual euro area countries. 
Based on the HFCS data,4
– Yi is net household income from all 
sources.
– Ci is the sum of non- durables expend-
itures, plus rent, plus durables expend-
itures.
– Ai is the sum of all sight deposits, 80% 
of saving deposits, all mutual fund shares 
invested in money market instruments, 
the country- specifi  c percentage of bonds 
assumed to be maturing, plus 90% of 
managed accounts.5

3 The data source for the study is the second (and 
latest ) available wave of the household survey. The 
follow ing reference periods were used: 2014 for 
Germany , end 2014/ beginning 2015 for France, 2015 
for Italy and end 2011/ beginning 2012 for Spain.
4 Other data sources are used to impute some infor-
mation that is not available in the HFCS, such as net 
income for certain euro area countries.

defi  nitions are explained in Tzamourani (2019).Deutsche Bundesbank

– Li is the sum of all ARMs, all non- 
mortgage credit plus the fraction of 
fi  xed- rate mortgages maturing in the 
year after the survey plus all loan pay-
ments. These are all measured annually.
– To compare results across individual 
countries and groups of households, the 
URE is scaled with the average gross 
income  of the country or group it refers 
to.6
The top diagram in the adjacent chart 
shows, using boxplots, the distribution of 
URE s across the euro area and in the four 
largest euro area economies, i.e. Germany, 
France, Italy and Spain. The study fi  nds that 
the median household (black line) in the 
euro area and in the individual countries 
considered has a positive interest rate ex-
posure. Assuming an equal pass- through of 
policy rate changes to deposit and loan 
rates, and all other things being equal, the 
median household would gain from a rise 
in interest rates. The chart also shows that 
the means of the distribution (blue lines) 
across countries display greater heterogen-
eity. Whereas households in France, Ger-
many and Italy have a positive URE  on 
average, households in Spain have a nega-
tive URE. This heterogeneity is driven 
mainly by the differences in the structure of 
households’ liabilities, and particularly by 
the differences in the prevalence of ARMs 
(see the table on p. 22).7
6 Thus, the calculated measure when comparing 
countries, for example, gives the interest rate exposure 
of households as a share of the respective country’s 
average gross income. Multiplying this fi  gure by a pol-
icy interest rate change in percentage points, and 
assuming  an equal pass- through for loan and deposit 
rates, one obtains the net increase or reduction in 
households’ interest income as a percentage of the 
average gross income of the country in question as a 
result of the change in the policy interest rate.

dence of the heterogeneity across the euro area coun-

The countries with a distinctly positive mean 
URE, such as Germany and France, have a 
low prevalence of ARMs, whereas in coun-
tries with a highly negative mean URE, 
such as Spain, the percentage of house-
holds holding an ARM is higher. In Italy, the 
prevalence of ARMs among mortgagors is 
not as low as in Germany or France. How-
ever, since the percentage of households 
with a mortgage is very small, the percent-
age of Italian households with an ARM is 
also very low, leading to a positive mean 
URE. Another factor which plays a role in 
shaping the heterogeneity in the interest 
rate exposure of households across coun-
tries is the difference in the ratio of deposits 
to total wealth, as deposits are more ex-
posed to changes in interest rates than 
other wealth components.
As further shown in the study, there is also 
considerable national heterogeneity across 
wealth, income, age and housing status, 
leading to different URE s in the various 
countries.
The diagram second from the top on p. 21 
depicts the mean interest rate exposure for 
net wealth groups in the euro area and the 
selected four euro area countries.8 On the 
whole, low net wealth households have a 
negative URE, as they are more heavily 
indebted . The URE increases, on average, across net wealth groups, as households in 
higher wealth groups are less indebted and 
have accumulated more assets.
In the euro area, as well as in France and 
Italy, it is only the households in the lowest 
20% of the net wealth distribution that 
have, on average, a negative URE. In 
Spain, on the other hand, where house-
holds are more indebted and mortgages are 
predominantly ARMs, the households in the 
middle net wealth groups also have, on 
average, a negative URE. These house-
holds would be hurt by an increase in inter-
est rates, all other things being equal.
Since the holdings and the amount of ARMs 
are, given their construction, important de-
terminants of the URE, there is substantial 
heterogeneity in interest rate exposure be-
tween households with different housing 
status. The diagram second from the bot-
tom on p. 21 depicts the mean interest rate 
exposure for outright homeowners, home-
owners with a mortgage and renters in the 
euro area and in the four selected euro area 
countries. Predictably, homeowners with a 
mortgage have, on average, a negative 
URE, whereas outright homeowners have, 
on average, a positive URE. Germany and

interest rate effect comprises changes in inter -
est earnings and payments, assuming that 
stocks of assets and liabilities remain constant. 
The portfolio effect, on the other hand, ignores 
changes in interest rates and results from shifts 
in the structure of assets and liabilities.17 The 
upper chart on p.  24 shows the cumulative 
change in net interest income, including the 
interest rate and portfolio effect, from the third 
quarter of 2008 to the current end. The starting 
point for this analysis is the beginning of the 
monetary policy easing phase in the euro area.
At the aggregate level, euro area households’ 
net interest income largely moved sideways. 
This is because the fall in interest income was 
almost completely offset by interest payments, 
which underwent a similar decline. The differ -
ence between the interest rate effect on the 
assets side and the liabilities side was therefore 
close to zero. Only in recent years has net inter -
est income slipped slightly below its 2008 level, 
mainly as a result of the recent sharp decline in interest earnings. At the country level, house -
holds show a certain degree of heterogeneity: 
while developments in Germany and France 
were broadly in line with those in the euro area 
as a whole, the diminishing interest rate level 
had a particularly strong impact in Spain in the 
form of lower financing costs and an overall

rates …France are exceptions in this respect, as the 
percentage of households with ARMs 
among mortgagors is very low in these 
countries.
There is also heterogeneity in interest rate 
exposure across age groups (see the bot-
tom diagram on p. 21). As households grow 
older, they accumulate more and more 
assets, including interest- bearing deposits, 
and pay off their debt. In the euro area as 
whole, the youngest age group (16-34 
years, as determined by the age of the 
household reference person) has on aver-
age a negative interest rate exposure. By 
contrast, in France, Germany and Italy, the 
youngest age groups have, on average, a 
positive URE, though it is close to zero in 
France. In Spain, the average interest rate 
exposure for the two youngest groups is 
negative.
17 The breakdown into interest rate and portfolio effects 
requires sectoral information on the average maturity and 
interest rate fixation period of the interest- bearing financial 
instruments. This information is included indirectly in the 
sector- specific implicit average interest rates, which can be 
calculated using information from the financial accounts 
and the national accounts. More specifically, the implied 
average interest rate is calculated via the ratio of interest 
payments and interest earnings to the nominal value of the 
corresponding interest- bearing financial instruments. To 
calculate the interest rate effect, the stocks of the relevant 
financial instruments at the beginning of monetary policy 
easing (Q3 2008) are multiplied by the corresponding im -
plied average interest rate. Any changes to the net interest 
income over and above this then represent the portfolio 
effect. In this context, the information about interest pay -
ments and interest earnings reflects the situation after the 
allocation of financial intermediation services indirectly 
measured (FISIM) to the relevant sector. Since the figures 
shown in the financial accounts are usually based on mar -
ket values, nominal values are proxied using cumulative 
transactions since 1999.Deutsche Bundesbank

increase in net interest income. This was mainly 
due to the relatively high share of floating rate 
loans and the relatively low volume of interest- 
bearing net financial assets. In Italy, by con -
trast, the share of debt securities in the port -
folio of households at the start of the monetary 
policy easing phase was far higher than in the 
other Member States. As a result of this, the 
decline in interest earnings, which formed part 
of an interest rate effect on the assets side, re -
duced net interest income very sharply here. 
Unlike the interest rate effect, portfolio effects 
did not play a significant role.
Unlike households, non- financial corporations 
in the euro area as a whole and in each of the 
countries analysed have experienced an in -
crease in net interest income since the begin -
ning of the monetary policy easing phase (see 
the lower chart). This was primarily driven by 
the decline in interest payments, and thus the 
interest rate effect on the liabilities side. In 
some countries, the portfolio effect was slightly 
more pronounced for non- financial corpor -
ations than for households. In Germany, and 
especially in France, the accumulation of 
interest- bearing assets (including deposits, in 
particular) also contributed to a rise in net 
interest income. In addition to this, over the re -
porting period as a whole, non- financial cor -
porations in France increased their liabilities 
more strongly than those in other countries. 
This was accompanied by higher interest pay -
ments and reduced net interest income per se.
Developments in debt service 
ratios

wise reflect both the balance sheet structure of 
the relevant sector and interest rate develop -
ments. The debt service ratio includes the inter -

order to service a debt.18 Developments in the 
debt service ratio are influenced by the average 
interest rate payable on the debt. In addition, 
levels of indebtedness and disposable income 
also play a role.19 The adjacent chart shows 
cumu lative developments in debt service ratios 
for households in the four large Member States 
and the euro area as a whole since the third 
quarter of 2008.20 It also reveals the contribu -
tions of the three components mentioned 
above to changes to the debt service ratio.
The debt service ratio of households in the euro 
area as a whole has declined steadily since 
2008. This was mainly the result of the falling 
interest rate level, which drove down ratios in 
Italy and Spain, in particular. The fact that the 
falling interest rate burden had a particularly 
strong impact in these two countries was due 
to the high share of floating rate credit liabil -
ities, as was pretty much the case for net inter -
est income. Moreover, while the household 
debt service ratio went down in Germany also 
as a result of increases in disposable income, in 
Spain, it was primarily the outcome of a reduc -Taken in

Total18 To capture all inflows available for making interest and 
redemption payments, the interest and dividend payments 
are added back into the gross disposable income in the 
calculations we use for our analysis. In addition, interest 
expenditure is taken into account before the allocation of 
FISIM here because these assumed charges are just as rele -
vant to debt service as “pure” interest payments. The impli -
cit average interest rate is then calculated in the same way 
as for net interest income. For a commonly used method of 
calculating the debt service ratio, see K. Dynan, K. Johnson 
and K. Pence, Recent Changes to a Measure of U.S. House -
hold Debt Service, Federal Reserve Bulletin, October 2003, 
pp. 417-426. With regard to the definition of the individual 
variables, the calculations in our analysis follow the meth -
odology of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). See 
also M. Drehmann, A. Illes, M. Juselius and M. Santos, How 
much income is used for debt payments? A new database 
for debt service ratios, BIS Quarterly Review, September 
2015, pp. 89-103.
19 As a general rule, the average maturity of debt also in -
fluences developments in the debt service ratio. Since their 
exact value is not known, in line with the BIS’s approach, 
we assume the average debt maturity to be 18 years for 
households and 13 years for non- financial corporations. 
Because this variable is constant, it does not influence the 
change in the debt service ratio in its own right in this an -
alysis.

ment of debt service ratios in the euro area, see also

tion in outstanding debt. By contrast, the large 
amount of new debt in France contributed to a 
moderate rise in the debt service ratios of 
households.
At the country level, the debt service ratios for 
non- financial corporations also showed mixed 
developments (see the lower chart on p. 25). In 
the euro area as a whole, the ratio has risen 
slightly since mid-2008, mainly due to the 
build- up of debt in France, which significantly 
increased the ratio there, although, as in the 
other countries, the falling interest burden per 
se helped to push it down. By contrast, in Italy, 
and especially in Spain, the debt service ratio 
fell. In Italy, this mainly stemmed from the de -
cline in the interest rate level. In Spain, a strong 
increase in disposable income as well as a re -
duction in debt also contributed to a further 
drop in the ratio. In Germany, however, it 
largely moved sideways.
Overall, the low interest rate level over the last 
few years has therefore helped to significantly 
improve the debt service ratios of both sectors 
and the net interest income of non- financial 
corporations. With regard to a return to normal 
interest rates, the question is therefore whether 
and to what extent these balance sheet indica -
tors could deteriorate again in an environment 
in which interest rates start to rise.
The impact of an interest rate 
normalisation on balance 
sheet indicators of the 
private  non- financial sector
In order to answer this question, scenario ana -
lyses are used to simulate the potential effects 
of an interest rate normalisation on net interest 
income and debt service ratios of the private 
non- financial sector in the euro area as a whole 
and in the four large Member States. The ana -
lyses are based on two steps. First, a vector 
auto regressive (VAR) model is used to estimate 
the correlations between the balance sheet in -
dicators net interest income and debt service ratio, the interest rate level and common 
macroeconomic control variables. In a second 
step, three different paths for the future devel -
opment of interest rates are factored into the 
model. The outcomes this delivers in terms of 
developments in net interest income and debt 
service ratios then equate to the possible future 
developments in the balance sheet indicators, 
conditioned on the interest rate path assumed 
in each case.
To ensure consistency, the VAR model em -
ployed here is based on the specification used 
above for the local projections and comprises 
the variables that are generally used in macro 
models for monetary policy analysis: quarterly 
growth rates for real GDP , the GDP deflator and 
real house prices. Interest rate developments 
are measured based on a short- term shadow 
rate which reflects both the level of long- term 
interest rates and the slope of the yield curve.21 
This basic model is then extended to include 
either net interest income or debt service ratios 
and estimated individually for each of the four 
major Member States as well as for the euro 
area as a whole.22
Based on these estimates, possible develop -
ments in net interest income and debt service 
ratios are then simulated over the period from … and

21 The shadow rate comes from the Geiger and Schupp

F.  Schupp (2018), With a little help from my friends,

22 Account is taken of net interest income or debt service 
ratios of both sectors – households and non- financial cor -
porations – simultaneously in order to capture potential 
interdependencies between these variables. This yields a 
total of ten models: five models for the basic model ex -
tended to include net interest income of both sectors and 
five models for the basic model extended to include debt 
service ratios of both sectors. In addition, all models in -
corporate a crisis dummy, a time trend and an interaction 
term between the crisis dummy and the time trend. The 
binary crisis dummy takes a value of zero for the period 
from the fourth quarter of 1999 to the second quarter of 
2008 and a value of one for the period from the third quar -
ter of 2008 to the second quarter of 2018. In combination 
with a linear time trend, this permits a check for a possible 
structural break as a result of the financial crisis. Based on 
information criteria, the optimum number of lags is deter -
mined to be two and is applied across all models. The esti -
mation period stretches from the fourth quarter of 1999 to

the third quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter 
of 2020. At this point, it should be noted that 
the simulations do not estimate the impact of 
an exogenous monetary policy shock – i.e. a 
monetary policy measure that is unexpected by 
market participants. Historical correlation pat -
terns are, in fact, used to analyse potential de -
velopments in net interest income and debt 
service ratios under three different interest rate 
normalisation scenarios. The design of the 
simulations also ensures that possible changes 
to net interest income and debt service ratios 
are not driven by divergent macroeconomic de -
velopments. To this end, the macroeconomic 
projections with regard to GDP and the GDP 
deflator produced by Eurosystem staff are ap -
plied to all scenarios across the simulation 
period.23 As regards developments in the 
(shadow) interest rate, the following three 
scenarios are considered:24
– “Baseline scenario”: the interest rate path is 
in line with market participants’ expect -
ations.
– “No tightening”: interest rates remain un -
changed at the same level as in the fourth 
quarter of 2018.
– “Rapid tightening”: every quarter, interest 
rates rise 15 basis points faster than in the 
baseline scenario.
In the baseline scenario, interest rates normal -
ise in line with market participants’ expect -
ations as at the end of the fourth quarter of 
2018 as derived from a term structure model.25 
In the “no tightening” scenario, the implicit as -
sumption is that the real economy will continue 
to recover, but that this will require a higher 
degree of monetary policy support than market 
participants are currently pricing in. By contrast, 
the “rapid tightening” scenario assumes that 
developments in the economy as a whole 
mean that interest rates will have to be tight -
ened significantly more rapidly than market 
participants currently expect. The chart above 
shows the cumulative change in net interest in -come throughout the simulation period. To 
make a comparison easier, the change during 
the last interest rate tightening cycle (third 
quarter of 2005 to third quarter of 2008) is de -
picted alongside the simulated development in 
the three scenarios.

23 See ECB, A guide to the Eurosystem/ ECB staff macro -
economic projection exercises, July 2016. The way in which 
the simulation is structured is therefore based on the 
assump tion that even in the two alternative scenarios, the 
economic recovery will continue and rates will converge 
towards the inflation target. An alternative approach 
would be not to specify the pathways for real GDP and 
inflation. In this case, the “rapid tightening” scenario out -
lined below would lead to an overly hasty normalisation of 
monetary policy with a negative impact on the economic 
recovery. In the “no tightening” scenario, however, the 
monetary policy normalisation would be initiated too late. 
The negative and positive feedback effects on the real 
economy would thus result in a somewhat larger diver -
gence of the simulated developments across the scenarios. 
However, the qualitative results are consistent with the 
outcomes discussed below.
24 As data are already available for the shadow rate for the 
third and fourth quarters of 2018, the actual data are used 
here.

For households, net interest income at the euro 
area level, as well as in Germany, France and 
Spain, is virtually unchanged in all scenarios. 
Because households in Spain have a high pro -
portion of floating rate liabilities, the variation 
across the individual scenarios is somewhat 
higher. Italian households could benefit signifi -
cantly from an interest rate normalisation. 
Given that households in Italy have a relatively 
large stock of debt securities that are remuner -
ated at market rates, there is a clear increase in 
net interest income, which also varies markedly 
across the scenarios. During the low interest 
rate period, Italian households suffered the 
largest losses.
Non- financial corporations in the euro area, by 
contrast, would see a drop in net interest in -
come under the baseline scenario, though it 
should be significantly less pronounced than 
during the most recent tightening cycle. Under 
the “no tightening” scenario, the drop is con -
siderably smaller, while it is markedly larger if interest rates are tightened rapidly. At the 
country level, non- financial corporations in Italy 
and Spain would see a sharp fall in net interest 
income. Conversely, this sector had, in both 
countries, also benefited most from falling 
interest rates during the low interest rate 
period. The high proportion of floating rate li -
abilities means that here, too, there is a clear 
variation across the scenarios. In Germany, net 
interest income decreases slightly regardless of 
the scenario under consideration, while the re -
sults for France suggest a small increase in all 
cases.
The adjacent chart shows the results of the 
simulation for the debt service ratios. For 
households, the baseline scenario for the euro 
area as a whole indicates a small decrease in 
the debt service ratio. Developments in the two 
alternative scenarios differ only slightly. At the 
country level, debt service ratios also sink in all 
scenarios. Because households in Spain have a 
high proportion of floating rate liabilities, there 
are clear variations across the scenarios. In Ger -
many and Italy, the large percentage of liabil -
ities with long interest rate fixation periods 
means that the decline is comparable in quan -
titative terms in all scenarios. In France, virtually 
no change is expected, regardless of the scen -
ario.
The fact that developments are relatively mod -
erate in all countries can be explained by the 
circumstance that, during the last tightening 
cycle, households (with the exception of those 
in Germany) raised debt levels in response to 
rising house prices and a favourable income 
situation (in some cases, significantly).26 This 
led to rising redemption payments and a cor -
responding increase in debt service ratios. At 
present, however, it can be assumed that the 
deleveraging process that has taken place over 
the last few years will continue in the tighten -Net interest

ing phase, or at least that debt levels will not 
rise significantly.27
For non- financial corporations in the euro area 
as a whole, there is a moderate increase across 
all scenarios, which falls perceptibly short of 
the increase seen during the last tightening 
phase. At the country level, there is a marked 
rise especially among non- financial corpor -
ations in France. Among this group, the debt 
service ratio swells significantly in all scenarios, 
and rises more sharply than in the period from 
the third quarter of 2005 to the third quarter of 
2008 even if constant interest rates are as -
sumed. This is because there has been a clear 
increase in the level of indebtedness in recent 
years, and this trend was implicitly extrapolated 
in the simulations. If the rate at which new 
debt is acquired were to decelerate significantly 
once an interest rate normalisation was intro -
duced, the changes could be expected to be 
perceptibly smaller. The simulations yield a 
small drop for non- financial corporations in Germany that is fairly similar across all scen -
arios given the high percentage of fixed rate 
liabilities.
In Spain and Italy, simulations indicate a de -
crease in debt service ratios. The noticeable dif -
ferences between the various interest rate 
scenarios in Spain are due to the high propor -
tion of floating rate liabilities. There are also 
noticeable, albeit slightly smaller, differences 
between the three scenarios among non-  
financial corporations in Italy, which are also 
frequently financed with floating rate loans. 
The striking differences as compared with what 
happened during the previous tightening cycle 
can be explained by the circumstance that, 
back then, with the economy strong, non-  
financial corporations, too, took on consider -
able amounts of debt. This led to rising re -
demption payments and a corresponding in -Moderate

crease in debt service ratios. In the current situ -
ation, by contrast, the deleveraging process of 
recent years is likely to continue during the 
tightening cycle.28
Evaluation of results and 
concluding remarks
This article has focused on the question of how 
net interest income and debt service ratios of 
the private non- financial sector might develop 
as interest rates normalise. Overall, the results 
suggest that balance sheet indicators should 
deteriorate only slightly, with non- financial cor -
porations tending to appear more vulnerable 
than households at the sectoral level. For ex -
ample, the changes as calculated based on the 
simulations are generally low compared with 
the adjustments during the low interest rate 
period and the changes during the last interest 
rate tightening cycle (see the chart on p. 29).
This can be attributed primarily to two factors. 
First, indebtedness in some sectors and coun -
tries has come down significantly in recent 
years and should not pick up again significantly 
over the next few years, unlike during the last 
tightening cycle. Second, the interest rate level 
is likely to be altered only gradually, something 
that was different in the previous period of ris -ing interest rates as well as with the easing dur -
ing the low interest rate period. With changes 
likely to be small, the deterioration in the bal -
ance sheet indicators is unlikely to be accom -
panied by a significant weakening of the real 
economy.
The aggregate results for households and non- 
financial corporations obtained here must be 
qualified in two ways. First, there could be sig -
nificant differences between individual house -
holds and corporations within the two sectors. 
If an interest rate normalisation hits households 
and companies with a high level of debt and 
illiquid assets particularly hard, the potential 
negative effects on the real economy are likely 
to be stronger. Second, the analysis carried out 
here ignores the impact of an interest rate nor -
malisation on an economy’s other sectors – 
general government and financial institutions. 
If these were hurt by an increase in interest 
rates, this could also have negative financial 
and real economic implications.29Interest rate

Price competitiveness in individual euro 
area countries: developments, drivers and 
the influence of labour market reforms
Price competitiveness in the euro area countries has changed significantly since the introduction 
of the euro. In general, competitiveness vis- à- vis a broad group of countries has improved on 
balance over the past decade. This is mainly due to the nominal effective depreciation of the 
euro. However, within the monetary union itself, exchange rate movements are inconsequential. 
Over the past ten years, Greece, Ireland and Spain, in particular, have gained in price competi -
tiveness due to relatively low inflation. By contrast, Germany’s price competitiveness compared 
with its trading partners in the common currency area slipped slightly in this period.
If relative price levels in individual euro area countries are analysed on the basis of absolute pur -
chasing power parity theory, then, after a longer period of convergence, the differences between 
them became much more pronounced again starting in 2011. However, the price level typically 
also depends on the prosperity of the economy observed – as measured, for instance, by prod -
uctivity level. Thus, if – in order to account for potential Balassa-  Samuelson effects – the relative 
productivity levels of the individual countries are additionally taken into consideration, the disper -
sion of price competitiveness has barely moved. Price level developments in some countries 
appear to have contributed to reducing imbalanced competitive positions. This is especially true 
of Greece, where pressure to adjust the price level and implement structural reforms was high in 
this period due to the profound economic crisis.
This article contains a cross- country empirical analysis examining the extent to which reform 
measures have an actual impact on price competitiveness. Use is made, above all, of an employ -
ment protection indicator to model labour market reforms. The results suggest that relaxing 
employment protection legislation promotes competitiveness.Deutsche Bundesbank

Development of price 
competitiveness  in individual 
euro area countries
Since the outbreak of the global financial and 
economic crisis, the euro has depreciated 
against a number of currencies in several 
bursts, the most pronounced being in the 
period from 2010 to 2015. Despite its recovery 
in mid-2015, at the end of 2018 the euro was 
around 12% weaker in effective terms com -
pared with the currencies of 19 major trading 
partners than the average of the second quar -
ter of 2008. This is an appropriate point at 
which to make comparisons as it was then that the real estate crisis in the United States grew 
into a global financial crisis (hereinafter referred 
to as “the start of the crisis”). The euro’s depre -
ciation had a considerable impact on the price 
competitiveness of euro area suppliers. Real 
effective  exchange rates, which take into ac -
count not only weighted nominal exchange 
rate movements vis- à- vis the currencies of 
major trading partners but also the relevant in -
flation rates, are often used as an indicator of 
price competitiveness.1 As measured by the real

Real effective exchange rates, price competitiveness 
indicators  and concepts for their assessment
The nominal effective exchange rate 
(NEER ) is a trade- weighted average of a 
given currency’s bilateral nominal exchange 
rates,
NEER t,i=NY
j=1(St,j,i)wij,
where St,j,i denotes the bilateral nominal 
exchange rate of the currency in country i 
against the currency in partner country j at 
time t and wij represents the trade weight 
of country j for country i. An increase in S 
is usually defi  ned as a nominal appreciation 
of the domestic currency or the base coun-
try’s currency. If, for example, the euro area 
is considered base country i, an increase in 
the euro’s nominal effective exchange rate 
(NEERt,euro) denotes nominal effective euro 
appreciation, i.e. nominal appreciation of 
the euro on a trade- weighted average.
Adjusting the calculation by the ratio of the 
domestic price level to the foreign price 
level (shown here as Pt,i and Pt,j) yields the 
real effective exchange rate (REER):
REER t=NY
j=1(Pt,iSt,j,i/Pt,j)wij.
While the nominal effective exchange rate 
is the exchange rate of the domestic cur-
rency vis- à- vis a trade- weighted average of 
foreign currencies, the real effective ex-
change rate represents the value of a fi  xed 
basket of goods in the domestic country 
relative to its average value abroad.
The real effective exchange rate is often 
used as an indicator of price competitive-
ness. Real appreciation, i.e. an increase in 
the REER, occurs in two instances: when 
the domestic currency appreciates against trading partners’ currencies in nominal 
terms or when domestic price levels rise at 
a faster rate or fall at a slower rate than the 
average of trading partners’ price levels. In 
both cases, the relative price of the basket 
of goods at home and abroad becomes 
more expensive. This means that the price 
competitiveness of domestic providers de-
teriorates when real appreciation occurs. 
The real exchange rates of individual euro 
area countries calculated by the European 
Central Bank and the Bundesbank following 
a common methodology are known as har-
monised competitiveness indicators (HCIs).1
Applying this methodology, alternative real 
exchange rates can be calculated for a 
given base country – these differ primarily 
in terms of which and how many trading 
partners are taken into account in the cal-
culation (N ) and which defl  ator or price 
level is included (Pi and Pj).2 First, this art-
icle makes reference to the nominal and 
real effective exchange rates of the euro 
against the currencies of 19 trading part-
ners.3 Here, the real effective exchange rate 
of the euro uses GDP defl  ators for Pi and 
Pj. These defl  ators were selected because 
analytical results suggest that real exports 
1 See M. Schmitz, M. De Clercq, M. Fidora, B. Lauro 
and C.  Pinheiro (2012), Revisiting the effective ex-
change rates of the euro, ECB Occasional Paper 
No 134. In particular, the methodology for calculating 
the trade weights wij is also explained here. The afore-
mentioned methodology is used by the ECB and the 
Bundesbank to calculate not only the HCIs but also the 
effective exchange rates of the euro.
2 Price levels are often measured by means of indices. 
Unit labour cost indices may be used instead of price 
indices to calculate real effective exchange rates. For 
the sake of simplicity, these are also referred to as indi-
cators of price competitiveness.
3 These effective exchange rates are also presented in 
Table XII. 12. of the Statistical Section of this Monthly 
Report, which also provides information on the com-
position of the group of countries.Deutsche Bundesbank

of goods and services can be explained 
relatively reliably using indicators of price 
competitiveness based on broadly defi  ned 
aggregates.4
Moving from the real effective exchange 
rate of the euro, which, by necessity, covers 
trading partners outside the euro area only, 
to an indicator of the price competitiveness 
for an individual euro area country, it is 
neces sary to take account of trading part-
ners within the euro area as well. For ex-
ample, the indicator of price competitive-
ness vis- à- vis 37 trading partners covers the 
above- mentioned 19 trading partners out-
side the euro area and all 18 trading part-
ners within it.
In some cases, it makes sense for euro area 
countries to consider an indicator of price 
competitiveness that is not infl  uenced by 
nominal exchange rates. The indicator of 
price competitiveness calculated solely vis- 
à- vis the other 18 trading partners in the 
euro area bears this hallmark. Since, by def-
inition, all euro area countries use the euro 
as their currency, the nominal exchange 
rate (for the period since euro adoption) 
can be expressed in the aforementioned 
equations as St,j,i = 1. Changes in the indi-
cator are then determined exclusively by 
infl  a tion rate differentials.
Econometric analyses tend to benefi  t from 
large sample sizes. If opting for a panel of 
price competitiveness indicators, these can 
be obtained by means of sets of indicators 
going far back into the past or by taking 
into account sets of indicators for a large 
number of countries. In the fi  rst case, this 
article uses indicators of price competitive-
ness for individual euro area countries vis- à- 
vis 19 industrial countries. The trading part-
ners here are the 11 founding countries of 
the euro area, Greece and eight other trad-
itional industrial countries (Canada, Den-mark, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, 
the United Kingdom and the United 
States).5 These indicators are available for 
all of the countries specifi  ed on the basis of 
several broad defl  ator concepts, e.g. GDP 
defl  ators, defl  ators of total sales and unit 
labour  costs in the total economy. There are 
particularly long time series available, 
stretching back to 1972, if using defl  ators 
of total sales. However, these are normally 
only used to analyse price competitiveness 
for the period from 1975 onwards due to 
the turbulence caused by the shift from the 
Bretton Woods system of fi  xed exchange 
rates to fl  oating exchange rates.
Indicators of price competitiveness vis- à- vis 
56 trading partners are available for all 
19  euro area countries as well as for 38 
other countries, but only on the basis of 
consumer price indices.6 Given the broad 
coverage of trading partners, these indica-
tors have the advantage of being particu-
larly representative in this respect. However, 
the heterogeneity of the countries means 
that, when looking at price increases in de-
veloping countries and emerging market 
economies, it is not possible to clearly dis-
tinguish between catch- up processes and 
declining competitiveness.
Lastly, this article also makes mention of 
real effective exchange rates where the 
ratio Pt,i/ Pt,j is captured by relative price

indicators of price competitiveness on real exports of 
goods and services, Monthly Report, January 2016,

constitute harmonised competitiveness indicators, 
which are only available for shorter periods.

Monthly Report in the context of the effective ex-

column. See also Schmitz et al. (2012), op. cit.Deutsche Bundesbank

levels rather than price indices.7 In a monet-
ary union where nominal exchange rates 
play no role, it is therefore possible to speak 
of effective relative price levels for corres-
ponding effective real exchange rates. Con-
trary to indicators based on price indices, 
these allow assertions to be made about 
the effective relative price level at a given 
point in time without the need for a refer-
ence period.
In order to assess whether the value of the 
price competitiveness indicator at a given 
point in time is favourable or rather un-
favourable, this indicator value must be 
compared with an economically justifi  ed 
benchmark. To this end, three simple ap-
proaches are commonly used.8 Relative pur-
chasing power parity theory implies that 
the benchmark should be a long- term aver-
age for the indicator series over time. If the 
current real value of the currency is higher 
than the long- term average, this can be in-
terpreted as unfavourable price competi-
tiveness on the part of the country or cur-
rency area in question. This approach is par-
ticularly well suited for indicators of price 
competitiveness that are calculated using 
price or cost indices and cover countries at 
a similar level of development.
By contrast, the other two approaches can-
not be applied to such index- based real ef-
fective exchange rates; instead, they require 
indicators to be calculated by means of 
relative price levels. Due to their superior 
comparability across different countries, 
however, these approaches are more suited 
to examining corresponding measures of 
dispersion. In the case of absolute purchas-
ing power parity theory, the benchmark 
corresponds to a situation in which the 
price of a given basket of goods – calcu-
lated in a single currency – is the same at 
home and on a trade- weighted average of 
trading partners. While deviations from such a benchmark allow conclusions to be 
drawn about price level comparisons, they 
are, at best, suited as an approach to 
assess ing price competitiveness over the 
very long term.
A more targeted measure of price competi-
tiveness adjusts relative price levels before-
hand for the relative productivity levels of 
the countries under review. This is achieved, 
for example, by regressing relative price 
levels on relative productivity levels, the 
esti mated residuals of which are used in the 
equation for the real effective exchange 
rate.9 If such a relative price level adjusted 
for relative productivity corresponds to the 
weighted average of a country’s trading 
partners, this yields the benchmark in ac-
cordance with the productivity approach. In 
the present article, this measure is taken as 
the basis for calculating the dispersion of 
price competitiveness in the euro area.
7 Apart from nominal exchange rates, relative price 
level calculations employ what are known as purchas-
ing power parities, which are published, inter alia, by 
the World Bank (see the World Development Indica-
tors database) and are ultimately based on data from 
the International Comparison Program.

of GDP against the currencies of 19 trading 
partners, price competitiveness in the euro area 
improved by 17½% between the second quar -
ter of 2008 and the end of 2018.
When looking at the competitive positions of 
individual euro area countries, it is essential to 
consider the relative price movements within 
the monetary union, too. Indicators of com -
petitiveness vis- à- vis 37 trading partners, for in -
stance, include 19 partner countries outside 
the euro area and all trading partners within it.2 
As measured by the harmonised competitive -
ness indicator based on deflators of GDP , Ger -
many’s price competitiveness has improved by 
5% on balance since the start of the crisis.3 The 
nominal depreciation of the euro outlined 
above played a major part in this develop ment. 
By contrast, within the euro area, individual 
countries’ price competitiveness hinges solely 
on their relative price and cost developments; 
euro exchange rate movements have no direct 
impact. For instance, in the same period and 
compared with its euro area trading partners 
– rather than the broader group of countries – 
Germany’s price competitiveness deteriorated 
by 5½%.
If the analysis is extended to include other euro 
area countries, it is not just Germany, but also 
Luxembourg, Austria, Finland and Belgium, for 
instance, that have suffered a loss in price com -
petitiveness since the second quarter of 2008 
in comparison with the other countries belong -
ing to the common currency area.4 At the other 
end of the spectrum are, first and foremost, 
Greece, Ireland, Spain, France and the Nether -
lands, where price competitiveness within the 
euro area has improved since the outbreak of 
the global financial and economic crisis thanks 
to lower rates of inflation. Using the indicators 
vis- à- vis 37 euro area and non- euro area trad -
ing partners, all founding members of the 
monetary union – with the exception of Lux -
embourg – plus Greece have gained in price 
competitiveness since the start of the crisis due 
to the nominal effective depreciation of the 
euro outlined above. However, the gains for the latter five countries cited were particularly 
pronounced, reaching double digits; the results 
ranged between 19½% in Ireland and 12% in 
France.
Dispersion of price com-
petitiveness in the euro area
Rates of change in the indicators of price com -
petitiveness show, based on certain assump -
tions, whether a country has become more or 
less competitive over the period of observation. 
However, they do not provide any indication of 
how the competitive position is to be evaluated 
independent of changes over time. Price com -
petitiveness can only be assessed in relation to 
a benchmark that is derived on the basis of 
economic considerations.5 Without such a 
benchmark, it is impossible to assess whether 
shifts in price competitiveness show conver -
gence or divergence. If a benchmark is con -
stant, convergence may be brought about by 
member states of a monetary union aligning 
their prices and wages. One of the aims behind 
setting up the euro area was the hope that 
using a common currency would promote price 
level convergence.6 By contrast, if the bench -
mark varies over time, it is possible that sus -
tained changes in the indicator value represent 
an equilibrium process.Development

One possible benchmark for indicators of price 
competitiveness that are based on price or cost 
indices is their long- term average. Such a bench -
mark can be derived from relative purchasing 
power parity theory. According to this theory, in -
flation differentials between two currency areas 
are offset by opposing movements of the bilateral 
nominal exchange rate, ensuring that purchasing 
power parity at home and abroad remains con -
stant over the long term. Within a monetary 
union, for instance, relative purchasing power 
parity theory implies that inflation differentials do 
not cause permanent shifts in price levels across 
member states but rather that these are reduced 
over time. Under these circumstances, the indica -
tor of price competitiveness has to – technically 
speaking – be stationary as a time series to enable 
its expected value and thus the benchmark de -
rived using relative purchasing power parity the -
ory to be modelled over the long- term average.
Harmonised competitiveness indicators based 
on deflators of GDP are available for euro area 
countries as of the first quarter of 1995. As 
measured by its long- term average, which has 
been calculated over the period since this date, 
Germany’s current level of price competitive -
ness vis- à- vis 37 trading partners may be seen 
as favourable. However, such an assessment 
may depend, inter alia, on the group of trading 
partners and the period used to derive the average. For the German economy, values for 
the indicators of price competitiveness have 
been recorded since the early 1970s – but 
solely vis- à- vis 19 industrial countries, not the 
37 trading partners.7 This smaller group of 
countries comprises 11 euro area trading part -
ners plus Canada, Denmark, Japan, Norway, 
Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and 
the United States. As measured by the indicator 
of price competitiveness based on deflators of 
GDP vis- à- vis these 19 industrial countries, Ger -
many’s price competitiveness compared to the 
long- term average since 1975 currently tends 
to be classed as neutral. The difference here is 
mainly down to the smaller group of trading 
partners.
To determine the impact of the period used to 
derive the average on estimated competitive -
ness, the current indicator value is compared 
with an average calculated using a reference 
period that is shortened successively.8 It tran -Relative pur -

spires that the long- term average for 1975 on -
wards yields a particularly favourable assess -
ment of Germany’s current competitiveness on 
account of the price and exchange rate pattern 
in the second half of the 1970s being unfavour -
able for Germany. If the values from the 1970s, 
and later also those from the 1990s, are no 
longer included in the reference period used 
for deriving the average as it is shortened, the 
average calculated shifts by a maximum of 5%; 
as a result, the German economy’s current 
price competitiveness using an average over a 
shorter period could be up to 5  percentage 
points more unfavourable than in the former 
case. However, due to the fact that the devi -
ation from the benchmark is still low, its pos -
ition would still be considered neutral.9
Of the other states that have been part of the 
monetary union since at least 2001, the indica -
tor vis- à- vis 37 trading partners based on defla -
tors of GDP shows a competitive position that 
has been more favourable than the average 
since 1995 for Greece, France and the Nether -
lands, in particular. The assessment is some -
what less favourable if price competitiveness is 
compared with the smaller group of countries 
comprising the 18 other euro area countries. 
However, it should also be noted here that the 
assessment may change if a different reference 
period is used to calculate the average.Whereas relative purchasing power parity the -
ory in a currency union is based on inflation 
rates converging, the mechanism of goods ar -
bitrage when applying absolute purchasing 
power parity theory ensures that the price 
levels of trading partners expressed in a com -
mon currency converge. This concept involves 
the weighted average of the trading partner’s 
price levels converted to the domestic currency 
being used as a benchmark for the domestic 
price level. The indicators of price competitive -
ness employed thus far – calculated using price 
or cost indices – cannot be used to ascertain 
any information about relative price levels. The 
aggregate relative price level of a country com -
pared with the weighted average of the price 
levels of its trading partners – i.e. the effective 
relative price level – can be calculated from 
purchasing power parities such as those pro -
vided by Eurostat. These purchasing power par -
ities state the local currency price of a given 
basket of goods in the country observed rela -
tive to a base region.
To determine whether the competitive pos -
itions in the euro area as measured by absolute 
purchasing power parity theory have con -
verged over time, the coefficient of variation of 
the effective relative price levels across all coun -
tries can be used as a measure for the disper -
sion of these levels at a given point in time.10 
For the sake of simplicity, this measure is here -
inafter referred to as “price level dispersion”. A 
decline in this measure of dispersion implies 
that the effective relative price levels within the 
euro area are converging. It had already been Price com-

9 As purchasing power parity theory is a long- term con -
cept, the period of observation should not be too short. All 
averages used therefore span at least the last 15 years. To 
estimate the price competitiveness of the German econ -
omy, the Bundesbank usually uses a somewhat broader in -
dicator based on deflators of total sales rather than on de -
flators of GDP . Using this indicator, too, the finding that the 
German economy’s competitive position is currently more 
or less neutral is confirmed. This continues to hold true 
when the period for ascertaining the average for this indi -
cator is successively shortened from the relatively long 
period from 1975 onwards to a period of up to 15 years.

levels is calculated as a standard deviation of the effective

shown in the March 2009 Monthly Report 
that, with regard to price level dispersion across 
the common currency area, considerable pro -
gress towards convergence had been made up 
to that point, especially at the start of the 
1990s.11 After the euro area was established, 
the trend towards price level convergence con -
tinued, initially even surviving beyond the out -
break of the financial crisis. However, in com -
parison with developments in the ten years 
prior to the start of monetary union, conver -
gence was rather weak.12 When the sovereign 
debt crisis in the euro area peaked at the turn 
of 2010-11, the convergence process under -
went a turnaround. From 2011 to 2014, price 
level dispersion widened notably across the 
euro area countries included in the analysis, 
and since then has stayed put at an elevated 
level.
In 2007, the price levels in some countries 
– despite the progress previously made towards 
convergence – were still way off the weighted 
average of the country’s 11 euro area trading 
partners. For instance, in 2007, the price levels 
in Ireland and Finland were well above and the 
price levels in Portugal, Greece and Spain well 
below this benchmark; in some cases, the per -
centage deviation even reached double digits 
and ranged from -20% in Portugal to +13% in 
Ireland. Dispersion appears to have been par -ticularly wide within the group of countries 
with comparatively low effective relative price 
levels. After the US real estate crisis grew into a 
global financial and economic crisis over the 
course of 2008, the effective relative price level 
in countries with low prices (Portugal, Greece 
and Spain) initially began to rise again up to 
2011, whereas the comparatively high level of 
prices in Ireland – a country that was hit by the 
crisis early on – fell in relative terms. Overall, 
the price levels in these countries continued ad -
justing to those of their euro area trading part -
ners; the process of price level convergence 
pressed ahead. By contrast, the price level in 
Finland, which was already comparatively high, 
went up even further vis- à- vis these trading 
partners. This was due to the fact that the ag -
gregate wage level in Finland and, with it, unit 
labour costs continued to rise until 2013.13

in 2011 when adjustment pressure in the real 
economy intensified in countries that were par -Development

ticularly hard hit by the European sovereign 
debt crisis. In the wake of the crisis- related ad -
justments, the effective relative price level in 
Greece, Portugal and Spain fell. This meant that 
the price levels in the southern European per -
iphery countries, which were already relatively 
low, became even further removed from those 
of their European trading partners. This was es -
pecially true of Greece, where the economic 
crisis deepened during this time, putting greater 
pressure on its price level. By contrast, in Ire -
land, the relative price level rose again some -
what. These developments, too, contributed to 
a rise in price level dispersion starting in 2011.
The aggregate purchasing power parities 
underlying the calculation of effective relative 
price levels also include the prices of non-  
tradable goods which, as a rule, do not face 
international competition. An alternative ap -
proach to measuring price competitiveness 
takes into account the fact that price adjust -
ments in the non- tradable sector can cause the 
benchmark to shift. According to the Balassa-  
Samuelson model, productivity growth in the 
tradable sector can lead to wage rises in both 
this sector and the non- tradable sector.14 While 
this pushes up prices in the non- tradable sec -
tor, thereby increasing headline inflation, and 
causes the currency to appreciate in real terms, 
it does not have an impact on price competi -
tiveness. When determining the benchmark by 
applying such a productivity approach, then, 
the greater the equilibrium, relative price level 
in a country, which implies a neutral competi -
tive position, compared to its trading partners, 
the higher the productivity level in this country 
compared to its trading partners.15,16 That is 
why very productive economies usually have a 
relatively high price level without this necessar -
ily implying low competitiveness.
The productivity approach takes into account 
potential Balassa-  Samuelson effects by regress -
ing effective relative price levels on relative 
productivity levels in a panel regression and 
uniting the residuals to form an indicator of 
price competitiveness adjusted for relative productivity developments. In order to evaluate 
whether the competitive positions of the euro 
area countries included in the analysis have 
drifted apart in the past few years based on 
this approach, too, the determined competitive 
positions can also be used here to derive the 
coefficient of variation at a given point in time. 
If this measure of dispersion were to fall over 
time, this development would be interpreted as 
a convergence of price competitiveness in the 
euro area, in line with the considerations out -
lined above.

vided by the Conference Board are published as “Labor

16 In the model framework established by Balassa (1964), 
op. cit., and Samuelson (1964), op. cit., the fact that 
changes in the real exchange rate stemming from vari -
ations in productivity are not accompanied by a shift in 
price competitiveness is partly to do with the comparatively 
static nature of the model. As these variations in productiv -
ity do shift the equilibrium real exchange rate in the model, 
price competitiveness in the new equilibrium is the same as 
in the old one. However, the domestic wage level increases 
on the way towards the new equilibrium. A rise in product -
ivity thus means a welfare gain. In a dynamic approach 
(which is not modelled), it could be said that productivity 
growth temporarily raises price competitiveness for as long 
as it takes for wage growth to “consume” competition 
growth. In principle, the impact of variations in labour mar -
ket regulation on price competitiveness could be inter -
preted in a similar way; deregulation would then only im -
prove price competitiveness temporarily. However, this de -
pends on the specific design of the model. A further aspect 
concerns the role that non- tradable goods, which are often 
actually services, play in price competitiveness. As they are 
not tradable, they do not face international competition, 
which means that changes in prices of non- tradable goods 
do not affect price competitiveness. However, if – in a de -
parture from the assumptions in the model – non- tradable 
goods (such as state services in the form of available infra -
structure, for instance) are included as input factors in the 
production of tradable goods, it can be assumed that 
changes in prices of non- tradable goods would affect price 
competitiveness. The present analysis therefore also dem -
onstrates that the interpretation of shifts in the real ex -
change rate, too, is determined by the – often simplified – 
assumptions in the theoretical models.Deutsche Bundesbank

The dispersion of competitive positions in the 
euro area calculated this way is lower than that 
of the effective relative price levels described 
above. This is due to the fact that Greece, Por -
tugal and Spain have low effective relative price 
levels coupled with comparatively low product -
ivity levels, which fundamentally justifies their 
low price levels. For this reason, their competi -
tive positions deviate from the euro area aver -
age to a substantially smaller degree when the 
productivity approach is used than when ab -
solute purchasing power parity theory is 
applied . It is a similar situation for Luxembourg, 
where productivity levels are relatively high, 
justifying a comparatively high price level.
In spite of what was already a rather low dis -
persion of competitive positions in the euro 
area back in 2007 calculated using the prod -
uctivity approach, there was evidence of a fur -
ther slight convergence here until 2010. The 
dispersion of these competitive positions has 
since increased, as has that of effective relative 
price levels, on balance, but only to a compara -
tively modest extent.17
Applying the productivity approach, Greece’s 
and Spain’s competitive positions were neutral 
in 2007. Up to 2011, the relative price level in 
Greece rose disproportionately to productivity 
growth, leading to a deterioration in the coun -
try’s price competitiveness. Taken in isolation, 
this would have resulted  in a broader disper -
sion of competitiveness. In contrast to the 
Greek situation, price competitiveness in Spain, 
for example, changed relatively little prior to 
2011. The slight rise in the relative price level 
here was evidently largely consistent with the 
development of the relative productivity level.
The fall in relative prices in the wake of the sov -
ereign debt crisis in Greece contributed signifi -
cantly to the improvement in the Greek econo -
my’s unfavourable competitive position. Due to 
the fact that this caused Greece’s competitive 
position to move closer to the average of the 
country’s euro area trading partners once 
more, this development was again at odds with the trend of generally increasing disper -
sion in the euro area. The situation in Spain, by 
contrast, was in keeping with the slight diver -
gence in competitiveness. The country’s com -
petitive position has improved since 2011; in Dispersion

17 This result is in line with the findings of a recently pub -
lished study which uses a slightly different calculation 
method, but identifies a very similar pattern of price level 
dispersion within the euro area over time. See M. Hoeber -
ichts and A. Stokman (2018), Why price- level dispersion 
went up in Europe after the financial crisis, The World 
Economy, Vol.  41, pp.  913-925. The study additionally 
examines possible determining factors behind the increas -
ing dispersion of price levels since 2011 that it also identi -
fied. Evidently, a cointegration relationship exists between 
price level and income level dispersion in the euro area. 
This finding indicates that the increasing dispersion of euro 
area income levels has been one major cause of the rise in 
price level dispersion in the current decade. Hoeberichts 
and Stokman (2018), op. cit., see income level dispersion 
as a proxy variable for the costs of non- tradable intermedi -
ate goods. This explanation is ultimately very similar to the 
productivity approach referred to in this article. As the rise 
in price level dispersion has, since 2011, been only very 
weakly reflected in increased dispersion in a measure of 
competitiveness that adjusts relative price levels for the im -
pact of relative productivity levels, it can be stated on the 
strength of these results that productivity and income levels 
go some way towards explaining the increasing price level 
dispersion.Deutsche Bundesbank

positions in 2007. Ireland, which was hit by the 
financial crisis at an early stage, saw substantial 
improvement in its price competitiveness up to 
2011, contributing to the identified conver -
gence of competitive positions in the euro 
area. Competitive gains in the Irish economy 
were largely attributable to an exceptionally 
strong productivity surge. Ireland’s productivity 
per hour worked, for instance, which was used 
to determine competitiveness, rose by over 
20% between 2007 and 2011. This is by far the 
highest figure recorded across the advanced 
economies of Europe and North America dur -
ing this period, and stems partly from the de -
cline in hours worked at that time. However, 
the transfer of patents from multinational com -
panies to Irish branches also contributes greatly 
to the high level of Irish GDP growth recorded 
in the national accounts, generally speaking. 
Here, value added from licences, which in some 
cases is likely to have been generated primarily 
in third countries, is classed as part of Irish GDP . 
The productivity gains and increased competi -
tiveness of the Irish economy are thus probably 
overstated.18The competitive position of the Finnish econ -
omy, already deemed unfavourable in 2007 
according  to the productivity approach, has 
– based on these calculations – since deterior -
ated further vis- à- vis that of the other euro 
area countries included in the analysis. This is 
linked not only to Finland’s increasing relative 
price level, but also to the decline in its relative 
productivity following a drop in output in the 
electrical engineering industry and decreased 
output in the paper and wood- processing in -
dustries.19 These factors have resulted in an 
increasing  dispersion of competitive positions 
within the euro area.Competitive

The impact of labour 
market reforms on price 
competitiveness
Structural reforms are measures that target the 
supply side of a country’s economy and im -
prove the institutional and regulatory frame -
works for the macroeconomic production pro -
cess. By making labour markets more flexible, 
simplifying the tax system or cutting red tape, 
for example, such measures aim, inter alia, to 
create a more favourable business environment 
and increase aggregate productivity. It is strik -
ing that, to a partial extent, price competitive -
ness has improved particularly dramatically in 
recent years in those euro area countries which 
were under high adjustment pressure and, in 
some cases, have implemented quite extensive 
reforms in the labour and product markets. The 
degree of influence that labour market reforms 
exert on competitiveness may depend on 
whether conditions have improved in the trad -
able or non- tradable sector.20
In the theoretical literature, one subject that is 
modelled is the direct effect of labour market 
deregulation on price competitiveness, taking 
into account the fact that efficiency gains in job 
mediation reduce hiring costs and could result 
in a decline in active job- seeking.21 A labour-  
intensive non- tradable sector could benefit to a 
comparatively large degree from these cost 
savings. This would tend to reduce the prices 
of non- tradable goods and thus lead to real 
depre ciation.22
Something else that can be modelled is labour 
market reforms, which may increase aggregate 
productivity and thus influence the real ex -
change rate. This is the case, for example, 
when the allocation of factors is improved by 
increasing the flexibility of the labour market. 
Using a theoretical model, Du and Liu (2015) 
deduce that productivity in the non- tradable 
sector may increase under such circum -
stances.23 In line with the Balassa-  Samuelson 
model, this reduces the relative price of non-  
tradable goods. This movement represents real depreciation; the indicator of price competi -
tiveness signals an improvement.
The postulated positive impact of labour mar -
ket reforms on the indicator of price competi -
tiveness was subjected to empirical review 
using a panel of countries (see pp. 45ff.) The 
analysis relies on the OECD’s indicator of em -
ployment protection for regular employment as 
a reform variable.24,25 This variable is composed 
of eight differently weighted components 
which can be divided into three categories: 
procedural aspects; notice periods and sever -
ance payments; and dismissal-  related regula -
tions. The period under review is limited to the 
years 1985 to 2013, as these are the most re -
cent employment protection indicator data 
available. For reasons of data availability, the 
panel comprises, in addition to Germany, the 
19 other previously mentioned industrial na -
tions in the narrower group of countries.26

20 This is the case when labour market reforms have an 
impact on productivity initially and thus indirectly affect the 
real exchange rate, for instance, because, according to the 
Balassa-  Samuelson model, while productivity gains in the 
tradable sector lead to real appreciation, productivity gains 
in the non- tradable sector result in real depreciation.

Money and Finance, Vol.  30, pp.  587-603, use an ex -
tended Balassa-  Samuelson model to analyse the influence 
of efficiency gains in job mediation on the real exchange 
rate. At a given level of sectoral factor productivity, real 
depreciation, and thus an improvement in price competi -
tiveness, occurs in the model if labour market efficiency 
rises in the non- tradable sector.

24 The OECD provides three versions of employment pro -
tection indicators for regular employment which differ in 
terms of breadth of content. For reasons of data availabil -
ity, the relatively narrow EPRC_V1 indicator was used in the 
present empirical study.
25 Employment protection for regular employment has 
been singled out as just one aspect of labour market regu -
lation. Other labour market reforms, e.g. measures to liber -
alise temporary employment or subcontracting, can of 
course influence price competitiveness as well. However, 
this is not examined in this study.

variables. In addition to the employment pro -
tection indicator, a proxy variable for aggregate 
productivity and, as appropriate, further con -
trol variables are entered as exogenous vari -
ables.
The OECD indicator of employment protection 
for regular employment used in the study 
shows the following developments in the euro 
area countries analysed.27 Whereas in the 
1990s employment protection regulations 
were reinforced in Germany (1994), thus, based 
on the estimation results, putting downward 
pressure on the German economy’s price com -
petitiveness, Finland (1990), France (1987) and 
Spain (1995) implemented measures to relax 
such regulations. Ireland joined the path of 
reform  in 2005. Following the outbreak of the 
global financial and economic crisis and the 
ensuing   sovereign debt crisis, reform pressure 
increased and employment protection was 
relaxed  in a number of particularly hard- hit 
countries. For example, Portugal (2010, 2012 
and 2013), Greece (2011 and 2013) and Spain 
(2011 and 2013) implemented what were, in 
some cases, relatively comprehensive reforms 
in the context of the rescue programmes. In 
Italy, employment protection was only re -
formed to a comparatively minor extent in 
2013. While certain amendments were made 
to employment protection legislation in France 
in 2009,28 no action was taken in Germany and 
Finland. In Ireland, employment protection 
measures were even ramped up in 2012. Meas -
ured against the OECD’s reform indicator, sev -
eral other euro area countries have thus – in 
relative terms – taken steps towards liberalisa -
tion compared with Finland, France, Germany, 
Ireland and Italy in recent years.
The empirical analysis suggests that price com -
petitiveness can be improved by relaxing the 
rules on employment protection to a greater 
extent than those of partner countries. The 
wage- based indicator displays a greater degree 
of elasticity than the price- based indicator. This 
is certainly plausible, as the indicator based on 
aggregate unit labour costs is directly linked to labour market policy measures and exhibits 
relatively high volatility. The outbreak of the 
global financial crisis itself also appears to have 
exerted a not insignificant influence on the 
strength of this relationship. The significance of 
the estimated parameters thus increases con -
siderably when the crisis and post- crisis period 
since 2008 is differentiated from the pre- crisis 
period in the form of a dummy variable. The 
estimation results suggest that measures to 
deregulate  the labour market during times of 
crisis, when adjustment pressure is particularly 
high, have a stronger impact on wages and 
prices and consequently price competitiveness 
than is usually the case. The estimated effect of 
labour market regulation on price competitive -
ness both before and after the crisis is greater 
in economic terms when a relative productivity 
variable is also factored into the analysis.
However, theoretical reasoning suggests that 
not only could labour market regulation have a 
direct impact on price competitiveness, it could 
also have an indirect effect by influencing prod -
uctivity levels.29 The analysis does indeed indi -
cate that, for the period since the start of the 
crisis, relaxing employment protection regula -
tions increases aggregate productivity. As, 
accord ing to the estimates, an increase in prod -
uctivity raises the indicator of price competi -Evolution of the

27 As mentioned above, the OECD indicator only examines 
certain aspects of employment protection for regular em -
ployment. Reforms in other areas of labour market regula -
tion are not taken into account in the following overview, 
even if they have in some cases been profound – like the 
German labour market reforms since 2002, for instance.
28 After 2015, France implemented further such reforms.
29 One direct effect of a variation in labour market regula -
tion at a given level of productivity, as has been estimated 
so far, is produced in the model of Sheng and Xu (2011), 
op. cit., by altering the efficiency of job mediation. How -
ever, amending labour market regulations can also first 
have an impact on labour productivity and thus indirectly 
affect price competitiveness, as modelled by Du and Liu 
(2015), op. cit. In both cases, the direction of the effect on 
price competitiveness is greatly dependent on which sector 
is most affected by such amendments.Deutsche Bundesbank

Estimates of the impact of labour market regulation on 
price competitiveness
Various theoretical approaches postulate 
that structural features of the labour market 
have an impact on an economy’s price 
competitiveness. We refer, in particular, to 
the contributions of De Gregorio et al. 
(1994), Sheng and Xu (2011), Du and Liu 
(2015), and Berka and Steenkamp (2018).1 
Each of the aforementioned approaches 
refer to the modelling concept proposed 
by  Balassa (1964) and Samuelson (1964), 
according to which the real exchange rate 
is determined purely on the supply side by 
total factor productivity in the tradable and 
non- tradable sectors;2 however, they mod-
ify or expand the model in a way that allows 
structural features of the labour market to 
make an additional explanatory contribu-
tion. In order to verify this empirically, the 
following econometric model was esti-
mated as part of a panel regression:
qit=↵i+β1·Xit+β2·rit+"it ,
where the variable qit stands for the logged 
indicator of the price competitiveness of 
country i at point in time t, αi represents a 
country- specifi  c constant, rit generally de-
notes an indicator of relative labour market 
regulation, Xit is a vector of additional ex-
planatory variables which should at least 
contain the logged relative aggregate pro-
duction level, and εit is an independent and 
identically distributed random variable. The 
indicator of price competitiveness is defi  ned 
as the real exchange rate, which is calcu-
lated in this estimate against a group of 19 
key trading partners.3 Together with the 
base country, this group of advanced econ-
omies also forms the sample of 20 coun-
tries included in the panel. Similarly to the 
real exchange rate, the variables assumed 
as exogenous are considered for a given country relative to the trade- weighted aver-
age of the corresponding variables of the 
same 19 trading partners.
An OECD indicator that models the degree 
of employment protection is used as the

ical notes on trade problems, Review of Economics 
and Statistics 46, pp. 145-154. An aggregate increase 
in total factor productivity, whereby the total factor 
productivities of the tradable and non- tradable sectors 
rise in proportion with each other, results in a real ap-
preciation – as in the classic case of a productivity gain 
in the tradable sector only – if the tradable sector is 
capital- intensive compared with the non- tradable sec-
tor. See, for example, C.  Fischer and O.  Hossfeld

variable for labour market regulation.4, 5 The 
OECD’s indicator is composed of eight dif-
ferently weighted components that contain 
information on employment protection 
legis lation for regular employment. The 
scale of the employment protection indica-
tor ranges from 0 (lax regulation) to 6 (strict 
regulation). An increase in the relative em-
ployment protection indicator calculated on 
this basis signals that employment protec-
tion in the country concerned is regulated 
more strictly than before relative to the 
weighted average of the trading partners.
The above table shows the results of a fi  xed 
effects panel estimation based on annual data. Two variables are used as the indica-
tor of price competitiveness: fi  rst, a real ex-
change rate based on the defl  ator of total 
sales (upper half of the table), and second, 
one based on unit labour costs in the total 
economy (lower half of the table). In the 
former case, the observation period runs 
from 1985 to 2013, and in the latter from 
1995 to 2013.6 A regression which includes 
only employment protection as the ex-
planatory variable (see specifi  cation (1)) pro-
duces a positive coeffi   cient. This is signifi  -
cant where price competitiveness is based 
on unit labour costs in the total economy, 
but not signifi  cant where an indicator based 
on defl  ators of total sales is used. The esti-
4 The OECD’s indicator of the degree of employment 
protection has already been used in a number of com-
parable studies. In A. Bénassy- Quéré and D. Coulibaly 
(2014), The impact of market regulations on intra- 
European real exchange rates, Review of World Eco-
nomics 150, pp. 529-556, the authors build on the 
model employed by De Gregorio et al. (1994), op. cit., 
to estimate the impact of the OECD indicator on the 
real exchange rate for a panel of 12 European coun-
tries and fi  nd that stricter employment protection re-
sults in a signifi  cantly less favourable level of competi-
tiveness. However, Berka and Steenkamp (2018), op. 
cit., are unable to confi  rm this result in a slightly differ-
ent specifi  cation for 17 OECD countries. Finally, in 
M. Groneck and C. Kaufmann (2017), Determinants of 
relative sectoral prices: the role of demographic 
change, Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics 79, 
pp. 319-347, the authors include an interaction term 
between the employment protection indicator and a 
demographic variable and, in a panel of 15 OECD 
countries, they fi  nd that the stricter the labour market 
regulation, the more the relative price of non- tradable 
goods is driven up by an ageing population (i.e. price 
competitiveness declines). Unlike the analysis pre-
sented here, Bénassy- Quéré and Coulibaly (2014), op. 
cit., as well as Berka and Steenkamp (2018), op. cit., 
both use bilateral rather than multilateral variables and 
data that do not extend beyond the onset of the 
global fi  nancial crisis.
5 Employment protection for regular employment has 
been singled out as just one aspect of labour market 
regulation. Other labour market reforms, e.g. meas-
ures to liberalise temporary employment or subcon-
tracting, can of course infl  uence price competitiveness 
as well. However, this is not examined in this study.
6 The employment protection indicator is available for 
19 of the 20 countries in the panel for the period from 
1985 to 2013. The corresponding time series for Lux-
embourg only begins in 2008. The OECD currently 
does not provide employment protection indicators for 
the years after 2013. Indicators of competitiveness 
based on unit labour costs are available only from 
1995 onwards.Fixed effects estimates of the impact

mated positive coeffi   cient implies that 
stricter employment protection legis lation 
results in real appreciation, thus reducing 
price competitiveness. This is consistent 
with the above- mentioned theoretical 
models.7
It is conceivable that measures to (de)regu-
late the labour market have a stronger than 
usual impact on prices in crisis periods, 
when adjustment pressure is relatively 
high.8 For this reason, specifi  cation (2) is 
augmented with an interaction term be-
tween the employment protection indicator 
and a dummy variable that takes the value 
of 1 from 2008 onwards and 0 prior to 
that.9 It actually transpires that – independ-
ent of the competitiveness indicator – the 
impact of the chosen labour market regula-
tion measure on price competitiveness is 
signifi  cantly greater after 2008 than before.
If specifi  cation (3) is expanded in line with 
the theoretical concept to include a relative 
productivity variable (simply measured here 
as an index of relative real gross domestic 
product (GDP) per capita),10 the estimated 
impact of employment protection legisla-
tion on price competitiveness is even larger 
in economic terms both before and after 
the crisis. All employment protection- 
related coeffi   cients are now statistically 
signifi   cant. For the indicator based on unit 
labour costs, elasticity is markedly higher 
than on the basis of total sales defl  ators 
(0.5 compared with 0.2 before the crisis, 
and 0.6 compared with 0.3 after 2008). 
This is quite plausible, fi  rst because indica-
tors based on unit labour costs should have 
a direct link to labour market policy meas-
ures, and second because they are inher-
ently more volatile than those based on 
total sales defl  ators. Consistent with the in-
dications of the Balassa- Samuelson model, 
the productivity variable is signifi  cantly posi-
tive,11 i.e. an aggregate increase in product-ivity results in a real appreciation; in the 
context of the model, however, this should 
not be interpreted as a loss of competitive-
ness as it only refl  ects price pressures in the 
non- tradable sector.12
It can also be posited that labour market 
regulation in the countries analysed affects 
their price competitiveness not only directly 
but also indirectly via productivity. The 
model employed by Du and Liu, for ex-
ample, also indicates that this is the case.13 
To gain an impression of whether such a 
transmission mechanism actually exists, the 
impact of employment protection on the 
productivity variable is estimated in the 
same panel as before. This reveals that the 
coeffi   cient in question was not statistically 
signifi  cant before the crisis began, but has 
been signifi  cantly negative since then. 
Accord ing to the estimate, then, the higher 
the level of relative labour market regula-
tion, the lower the productivity level meas-
ured by relative GDP per capita. Thus, the 
above- described positive primary effect on 
7 However, several models stipulate that the adjust-
ment of employment protection legislation relates to 
the non- tradable sector.
8 In R. Anderton, B. Di Lupidio and J. Piqueras (2018), 
Labour and product market regulation, worker fl  ows 
and output responsiveness, in K. Masuch, R. Anderton, 
R. Setzer and N. Benalal (eds.), Structural policies in the 
euro area, ECB Occasional Paper 210, pp. 95-98, the 
authors in fact identify different labour market re-
sponses depending on whether a pre- crisis period up 
to 2007 or the crisis and post- crisis period from 2008 
is considered.
9 If the equation to be estimated with the interaction 
term is expanded to additionally include the specifi  ed 
dummy as a single variable, the coeffi   cients of the 
employ ment protection indicator remain statistically 
signifi  cant. They are each somewhat larger, however.
10 The specifi  cation thus follows Bénassy- Quéré and 
Coulibaly (2014), op. cit., and Du and Liu (2015), op. 
cit.
11 See, for example, Fischer and Hossfeld (2014), op. 
cit.
12 Further econometric specifi  cations were estimated 
to verify the robustness of the results. For example, the 
group of explanatory variables was expanded to in-
clude a relative unemployment rate as a cyclical vari-
able. However, this has only a minimal effect on the 
coeffi   cients of the employment protection indicator.

the indicator of price competitiveness 
would be counteracted by a secondary 
effect  via productivity, but only to a negli-
gibly small fraction. Based on specifi  cation 
(3) in the table on p. 46, the primary effect 
of a variation in the employment protection 
variable on price competitiveness is be-
tween 25 and 36 times as great as the 
countervailing secondary effect via product-
ivity.
Finally, there is the question of whether the 
result of a competitiveness- boosting impact 
of deregulating employment protection for 
regular employment can be generalised to a 
broader concept for structural reforms.14 To 
do so, a time series of the volume of regu-
lation compiled from sub- categories of the 
World Bank’s “Ease of doing business” indi-
cator is used as the explanatory variable. 
These sub- categories include regulation of 
cross- border trade or tax payments, for in-
stance.15 The regulatory indicator thus cal-
culated is only available for a relatively short 
period (2006 to 2017) but for a large num-
ber of countries. Therefore, the estimation 
generally uses variables relative to a broad 
country group of 56 trading partners. Indi-cators of price competitiveness compared 
with 56 trading partners are only calculated 
on the basis of consumer price indices, im-
plying that they be used as endogenous 
variables.16
A fi  xed effects panel estimation again based 
on annual data, which contains relative 
GDP per capita as an additional explanatory 
variable, produces a signifi  cantly negative 
impact of regulation on price competitive-
ness (see the adjacent table). Because – un-
like the employment protection indicator in 
the above model – the indicator is normal-
ised such that an increase signifi  es a de-
creasing volume of regulation, this implies 
that the latter is associated with rising price 
competitiveness. Here, too, there is again a 
signifi  cant countervailing secondary effect 
on price competitiveness through the im-
pact of the volume of regulation via prod-

negligible, also in terms of dimension. Gen-
erally speaking, the results for the impact of

the literature. Bénassy- Quéré and Coulibaly (2014), op. 
cit., for example, also fi  nd that in the pre- crisis period 
deregulation of the product market has a positive im-
pact on the price competitiveness of 12 EU countries. 
In M. Fidora, C. Giordano and M. Schmitz (2017), Real 
exchange rate misalignments in the euro area, ECB 
Working Paper No 2108, the authors also fi  nd for a 
broad panel of 57 countries that an improvement in 
the quality of regulation accelerates the adjustment to 
an equilibrium level of price competitiveness.
15 The “Ease of doing business” indicator itself has 
numerous methodological structural breaks and its 
quality is therefore low for an analysis that considers 
the time dimension. The time series used in this study, 
however, makes use of nine sub- categories that have 
only a few methodological structural breaks over the 
observation period. The categories are: enforcing con-
tracts, getting credit, dealing with construction per-
mits, resolving insolvency, paying taxes, protecting 
minority  investors, registering property, starting a busi-
ness, and trading across borders.

tiveness,30 liberalisation of the labour market 
yields a negative secondary effect;31 its eco -
nomic significance is, however, very minimal.
In addition to employment protection for 
regular  employment, however, other reforms   
that improve local conditions are also likely to 
influence aggregate productivity and price 
competitiveness – presumably positively. The 
World Bank’s ease of doing business indicator, 
which is calculated on the basis of ten sub-  
indicators, provides a measure of the level of 
business regulation in a given country.32 These 
sub- categories are available for quite varied 
time periods. In addition, the calculation 
method for the ease of doing business indica -
tor has been adapted on several occasions over 
time by widening the indicator set and the 
group of countries analysed. In order to ensure 
more reliable comparisons over time, a new 
aggregate regulatory indicator was calculated 
using nine of the ten sub- categories.33The impact of the aggregate regulatory indica -
tor or sub- indicators on the price competitive -
ness indicator was determined by means of a 
panel estimation using a broad panel of 55 
countries for the years 2006 to 2017. This influ -
ence proves to be significant in the baseline 
specification – when the volume of regulation 
is reduced as measured by the aggregate indi -
cator, price competitiveness improves. Here, Ease of doing 
business indica -
tor represents

reformsFindings

influence  of 
labour market 
reforms cannot 
simply be 
applied to 
broader struc -
tural reform 
conceptsregulation extending beyond the labour 
market on price competitiveness do not 
seem especially robust. For example, there 
is no coherent picture when the impact of 
the nine sub- indicators is gauged by study-
ing them separately rather than as an ag-
gregate.17 The estimation results presented 
in the latter part of this box, in particular, 
must therefore be interpreted with caution.
17 In a panel that considers all sub- indicators individu-
ally, some have a signifi  cantly positive coeffi   cient, 
others have a signifi  cantly negative coeffi   cient, and 
others still have an insignifi  cant coeffi   cient, without 
this being justifi  able at fi  rst glance.
30 On the face of it, this result may not appear to tally with 
the model of Du and Liu (2015), op. cit., in which the prod -
uctivity gains generated by labour market flexibility reduce 
the indicator. However, the differences between the model 
and the estimate can be explained by the fact that the 
model assumes productivity growth in the non- tradable 
sector only, whereas empirically, aggregate productivity is 
observed across all sectors, and by the fact that productiv -
ity gains in the tradable sector can be expected to have an 
adverse effect on the real exchange rate.
31 As employment protection regulations are only one of 
many factors influencing aggregate productivity, the prod -
uctivity variable must nevertheless be included in the analy -
sis.
32 Although the World Bank’s ease of doing business 
index includes information on labour market regulation, it 
is not part of the overall index.

too, a surge in productivity triggered by liberal -
isation subsequently weakens the primary 
effect , according to the estimates. However, 
these results do not appear to be very robust. 
For example, there is no coherent picture when 
the sub-  indicators are used in the regression 
rather  than the aggregate indicator. This may 
be linked to the fact that a general reduction in 
the volume of regulation can, unlike a relax -
ation of employment protection regulations, 
influence productivity in the tradable sector 
more strongly under certain circumstances.
Conclusion
In summary, it can be maintained that, over the 
past few years, competitive positions in the 
euro area have shifted in favour of those euro 
area countries which were relatively hard hit by 
the global financial and economic crisis and the 
subsequent sovereign debt crisis, and which 
have undertaken labour market reforms. Al -
though the dispersion of the effective relative 
price levels in the euro area has increased, the competitive positions of the observed euro 
area countries are, on average, still quite closely 
spaced when factoring in productivity develop -
ments.
An empirical study indicates that price competi -
tiveness can be improved by relaxing employ -
ment protection regulations for regular em -
ployment. The estimation results suggest that 
such measures aiming to deregulate the labour 
market during times of crisis, when adjustment 
pressure is particularly high, have a stronger 
impact on relative price levels and consequently 
price competitiveness than is usually the case. 
Of course, this should not be the only yardstick 
by which labour market policy measures in 
general and employment protection regula -
tions in particular are evaluated. It must also be 
borne in mind that although liberalisation gains 
may be high, this level of gains cannot be sus -
tained in the long term. However, where there 
is scope for deregulation, its implementation 
can have a positive impact on price competi -
tiveness, as these findings show.Deutsche Bundesbank

Financial cycles in the euro area
In the aftermath of the financial and economic crisis, researchers and those involved in economic 
policy- making have increasingly been turning their attention to cyclical fluctuations in the finan -
cial system. In these discussions, the term “financial cycles” is usually used to describe joint 
upward and downward movements of credit aggregates and asset prices over the medium run, 
which extend beyond the length of business cycles. The academic literature often presents finan -
cial cycles as the result of mutually reinforcing interactions between asset valuation and risk per -
ception in the financial system, which can then generate pronounced fluctuations in financial 
market variables and thus make for a more vulnerable economy.
When it comes to discussing financial cycles, there is no single generally accepted theoretical 
basis, nor a dominant method for measuring them. In this article, we apply methods from the 
field of frequency domain analysis to investigate properties of financial cycles in selected euro 
area countries. This is done using time series for credit aggregates and house prices, the dynam -
ics of which are often regarded as being representative of financial cycles. The focus lies on cross- 
country synchronisation of financial cycles in the euro area, looking primarily at whether credit 
and house prices in euro area countries follow cross- country cycles. The flexible empirical 
approach employed has the benefit of allowing the analysis of changes in these relationships 
over time and according to periodicity.
As a first step, a cohesion analysis is carried out. It reveals that cross- country financial cycles in 
the euro area play a less significant role in determining credit and house price dynamics in the 
individual countries than the overall euro area business cycle does for the dynamics of gross 
domestic product (GDP). This result suggests that it makes sense to be guided by developments in 
the individual member countries when setting macroprudential policy in the euro area.
Following on from this, the second step involves a detailed analysis of country- specific cycles and 
their cross- country synchronisation. It shows that fluctuations in the growth of loans to house -
holds in Germany are more weakly synchronised with the average of the other euro area mem -
bers included in the study than is the case for the other countries. Furthermore, house price 
growth in Germany exhibits significantly smaller fluctuations than in other countries.
The analysis of the relationship between real economic cycles and financial cycles reveals that 
credit growth, house price inflation and real GDP growth in the individual countries are subject to 
common cycles. Hence, financial cycles and real economic cycles should be viewed not as inde -
pendent phenomena but as being interrelated. It is therefore likely that macroeconomic policy 
measures also affect the real economy. In this case, there is also the potential for interactions 
between macroprudential policy and monetary policy to arise.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
In the aftermath of the financial and economic 
crisis, researchers and those involved in eco -
nomic policy- making have increasingly been 
turning their attention to cyclical fluctuations in 
the financial system. The financial crisis was a 
reminder that pronounced financial upswings 
may see market participants tend towards tak -
ing on too much risk and underestimating the 
riskiness of investments. By driving up asset 
prices even further, this behaviour can also lead 
households and firms to run up excessive debt. 
In an extreme case, asset prices and credit 
growth may decouple from the underlying fun -
damentals to a large extent. If this happens, 
even small disturbances in the financial system 
or real economy have the potential to provoke 
a significant and abrupt rise in risk aversion and 
burst the asset price bubble. Financial institu -
tions that had been financing the credit- driven 
climb of asset prices will find themselves forced 
to shrink their strongly expanded balance 
sheets – an exercise which generally entails a 
tightening of credit for firms and households 
and a drop in asset prices driven by “fire sales”, 
bringing significant costs for the real economy.1
Patterns of joint upward and downward move -
ments of credit aggregates and asset prices, 
such as house prices, are commonly referred to 
as “financial cycles”.2 These tend to be longer 
than business cycles.3 Furthermore, the results 
of numerous empirical investigations have 
shown that synchronisation of credit and asset 
price cycles across countries has increased over 
time.4 While it is true that asset price booms 
driven by excessive credit growth, as happened 
in the lead- up to the financial crisis of 2008-09, 
occur only rarely, this kind of excessive mani -
festation of the financial cycle generally culmin -
ates in a financial crisis.5 In addition, recessions 
associated with financial crises generally tend 
to be more severe.6 This means that informa -
tion on the financial cycle offers important in -
sights for assessing risks to financial stability.The concept of the financial cycle is not uni -
formly defined, however. Nor is there a gener -
ally accepted method for measuring financial 
cycles. For the most part, the literature de -
scribes financial cycles as the result of mutually 
reinforcing interaction between asset valuation 
and risk perception in the financial system that 
can lead to pronounced credit and asset price 
fluctuations.7 These can be explained by vari -
ous imperfections and distortions in the finan -
cial markets, such as information asymmetries, 
liquidity and financing constraints, or distorted Cyclical build- up

expectations.8 If such financial market imper -
fections are relevant, a downturn in the finan -
cial cycle may be accompanied by – or even 
amplify – an economic contraction. In an ex -
treme case, this can result in a financial crisis.
It was once widely believed that micropruden -
tial oversight monitoring the stability of individ -
ual institutions was sufficient to maintain the 
stability of the financial system. The global fi -
nancial crisis of 2008-09 changed all of this. 
The old view prevented recognition of risks 
that pose a threat for the stability of the finan -
cial system as a whole. Influenced by experi -
ences gathered during the crisis, macropruden -
tial policy was developed as a policy field in its 
own right. Its purpose is to bolster the financial 
system’s resilience to systemic risk and prevent 
market participants collectively from taking on 
excessive risk.9
This article addresses the question of whether 
selected euro area countries share a common 
financial cycle and how pronounced it is. Fur -
ther, we examine the relationship between fi -
nancial and real economic cycles.
Conventional methods from business cycle an -
alysis generally serve as the starting point for 
empirical measurement of financial cycles. In 
business cycle analysis, the notion of a cycle is 
generally understood to denote more or less 
regularly occurring fluctuations along a long-  
term growth trend for GDP . Financial cycles 
cannot be characterised by reference to just 
one economic variable, though. Just as the 
business cycle is to be understood as the co-  
movement of multiple variables (for example, 
economic activity, income and employment, af -
fecting more than one sector of the econ -
omy),10 the financial cycle, too, is a multivariate 
phenomenon. As such, it encompasses coincid -
ing fluctuations of different financial market 
variables and asset prices. Similarly to the busi -
ness cycle, the financial cycle also has within-  
country and cross- country dimensions,11 i.e. it 
can consist of common cycles in financial mar -ket variables and asset prices within one par -
ticular economy but also across countries.
By comparison with business cycles, when it 
comes to choosing a set of variables which ad -
equately captures the financial cycle, opinions 
are divided to a greater degree. At one end of 
the spectrum are those who boil the financial 
cycle down to fluctuations in credit aggre -
gates.12 At the other end lies the use of a broad 
range of financial data and asset prices, includ -
ing (but by no means limited to) interest rates, 
equity prices and house prices.13 The majority 
of studies position themselves somewhere be -
tween these two extremes and use a small set 
of variables that can adequately capture the Macroprudential 
policy as a 
policy  area in 
its own right

interactions between credit aggregates and 
asset prices. The selection of reference vari -
ables can have a significant bearing on the 
characteristics of any financial cycle identified 
from the data.14 In the literature, common fluc -
tuations in loans to the non- financial private 
sector and in house prices are often regarded 
as being informative indicators for the financial 
cycle. This is because, in particular, credit-  
fuelled real estate price bubbles can result in 
risks to financial stability.15 The empirical appli -
cation presented in this article is therefore 
based on data on credit aggregates and house 
prices.16
In addition to the choice of reference variables, 
there is another decision to be made: a suitable 
detrending method needs to be selected so 
that the time series of financial variables can be 
decomposed into trend and cyclical compon -
ents. There are a wealth of different detrending 
procedures available. They vary in terms of the 
number of underlying variables, the degree of 
theoretical foundation and the assumptions 
they make about the characteristics of the 
trend and its relationship to the cyclical com -
ponents (linear or non- linear, for instance).17 
Arguably the most commonly used approaches 
for measuring the financial cycle are based on 
univariate turning point analyses or techniques 
for filtering data developed in order to identify 
business cycles.18 These methods are mostly 
assumption- driven and do not allow us to test 
the existing hypotheses in respect of the finan -
cial cycle’s characteristics.19 When applying fil -
ters, the relevant frequency for the financial 
cycle has to be specified a priori, for example. 
This article therefore centres on a far more flex -
ible, multivariate approach (wavelet analysis), 
which makes it possible to identify common 
cycles in different variables and determine the 
relevant frequency ranges for those cycles from 
the data.
Applying this flexible econometric approach, it 
is thus possible to systematise the characteris -
tics of the financial cycle in the form of robust 
“stylised facts”. These refer to different traits of the cycles, such as average cycle length and 
amplitude, the interaction between the finan -
cial cycle and real economic cycles, and the 
interplay between financial cycles across coun -
tries. The analyses can only provide us with de -
scriptive results and trace correlations between 
variables; they do not enable any direct state -
ments as to causality. Causal relationships can 
only be derived by employing structural models 
which contain restrictions rooted in theory and 
which go beyond pure description. However, 
stylised facts derived from descriptive analyses 
can serve as the basis for more in- depth analy -
sis and inform the development of such models.

How are financial cycles 
measured?
Financial cycles cannot be observed directly 
and must therefore be estimated. Generally 
speaking, any time series can be expressed as 
the sum of a variety of cycles oscillating at dif -
ferent frequencies (see the box on pp. 56 ff.). 
One stylised fact drawn from the empirical lit -
erature dealing with credit and house price 
cycles is that the length of their quantitatively 
most significant cyclical components exceeds 
those of business cycles; business cycles are 
generally assumed to last up to eight years.20
Each time series represents the aggregate of all 
of the cycles contained within. This means that 
the components associated with the financial 
cycle need to be isolated. To be able to infer 
that these components are the result of finan -
cial cycles, it is also necessary to check whether 
there are common cycles across countries or 
different variables. If there are no such dynam -
ics in common, then the cycles are idiosyn -
cratic, i.e. they are variable- specific and 
country- specific – credit cycles or house price 
cycles, for instance.
Much of the literature adopts a two- stage pro -
cedure for this analysis. First, univariate filters 
are applied to extract the cycles with selected 
lengths from the variables under investigation. 
Second, the time series components extracted 
in this way are scrutinised with a view to iden -
tifying their characteristics and relationships to 
one another.
The filter procedures applied in the first step ex -
tract components with pre- determined cycle 
lengths – in other words, cycles at a given fre -
quency interval (see p. 58).21 They are purely 
statistical procedures and, as such, do not in -
volve any assumptions with respect to eco -
nomic structural relationships. A key decision 
to be taken when applying filters for measuring 
financial cycles is what frequency range will be 
pre- defined as relevant, i.e. the assumption as 
to the duration of oscillations.Setting too narrow a frequency range can re -
sult in potentially relevant common cycles in 
different variables being overlooked. Another 
issue is that the cycle lengths relevant for the 
financial cycle in the data can change over time 
and may, for example, over- run the pre- defined 
range. This would give the impression that the 
financial cycle has weakened or disappeared, 
when in actual fact its cycle length has simply 
changed. If a very wide band is set for cycle 
length, a broad range of cycles in the variables 
is captured. This makes it harder to identify 
common cycles if these only cover a fraction of 
the observed frequencies.
In many studies, the frequency band for the 
statistical filtering is set on an ad hoc basis. 
Cycle lengths of eight to 20 years or eight to 30 
years are among the commonly selected op -
tions.22 The chart on p. 59 illustrates one ex -
ample of this. It shows the cycles lasting be -Financial cycles

21 Other commonly used approaches are turning point an -
alysis and trend-  cycle decompositions with structural time 
series models. Turning point analysis plays an important 
role in the dating of economic cycles. See G.  Bry and

Procedures and Computer Programs, National Bureau of 
Economic Research, New York; and D.  Harding and 
A.  Pagan (2002), Synchronization of Cycles, Journal of 
Econometrics, 132, pp. 59-79. For examples of how this 
approach is applied to financial cycles, see Claessens et al. 
(2011), op. cit., and Drehmann et al. (2012), op. cit. For

series models, see A. Harvey and S. Koopman, Multivariate 
Structural Time Series Models, in C. Heij et al. (eds., 1997), 
System Dynamics in Economic and Financial Models, Wiley, 
New York. These models can also be interpreted as filter 
approaches, but with trend and cycles parametrically speci -
fied. Galati et al. (2016), op. cit., apply the approach to 
the United States, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the 
Netherlands. For each country, they extract common cycles 
in house prices and credit or the credit- to- GDP ratio. 
G. Rünstler and M. Vlekke (2018), op. cit., extend this an -
alysis to common cycles in house prices, credit and real 
GDP . For more information on this, see Section 3 of Rünstler

eight to 20- year range include Aikman et al. (2013), op. cit.

Frequency analysis and bandpass fi  lters
Wavelet analysis, the method used in the 
present article, is a refi  nement of frequency 
analysis or spectral analysis. Time series 
analysis  in the frequency domain is an alter-
native perspective to the more common 
time domain analysis.1
Both perspectives are mutually complemen-
tary and emphasise different aspects of 
time series. In the time domain, a time ser-
ies is interpreted as the sum of current and 
past random innovations (independently 
and identically distributed (i.i.d.) disturb-
ances).2 In the frequency domain, a time 
series is decomposed into periodic func-
tions, i.e. functions that exhibit recurring 
cycles. This decomposition makes it pos-
sible to analyse the signifi  cance of cycles for 
the time series.
The chart on p. 57 illustrates the concept of 
cycles with different frequencies. With 
y1  and y2 it shows two sine functions 
yt = sin(ωt) with different frequencies (ω). 
By defi  nition, there is an inverse relationship 
ω = 2π/ T between frequency and cycle 
length (T): the length of the fi  rst cycle is four 
periods (for quarterly data, one year), cor-
responding to a frequency of 2 π/ 4 = 1.57 ; 
that of the second is 12 observations (for 
quarterly data, three years), resulting in a 
frequency of 2 π/ 12 = 0.52 . The shortest 
possible  cycle (not shown) has a length of 
two observations, implying a frequency of 
2π/ 2 = π.
Cycles can differ not only in terms of fre-
quency but also in terms of amplitudes or 
phases. The example in the chart on p. 57 
shows two further cycles of the general 
form yt = A � sin(ωt + �). A denotes the 
amplitude, i.e. the size of the oscillations, and φ the phase, i.e. the horizontal shift of 
yt relative to a standard sine function.
y3 is a sine oscillation having the same 
frequency  as y1 but an amplitude of A = ½. 
Its oscillations are only half the size of y1. y4 
has the same frequency and amplitude as 
y1 but, compared to y1, displays a phase 
shift of π/ 2, i.e. it leads by one period.3
The idea behind frequency analysis is that a 
time series can always be written as the 
sum of a large number of cycles with differ-
ent lengths. This is given by the spectral 
representation of a covariance stationary 
time series Yt:
Yt=µ+Z⇡
0[↵(!) cos( !t)
+δ(!) sin(! t)]d!
µ is the mean of Yt and ω is, as before, the 
frequency (within the interval between 0 
and π). α(ω) and δ(ω) are frequency- 
dependent weights which determine the 
importance of a cycle at a given frequency 
for the pattern of the time series relative to 
cycles at other frequencies.
An important instrument of frequency an-
alysis is the (power) spectrum. It is a tool 
for  identifying the frequencies of those 
cycles which are particularly important to 
the dynamics  of a time series. The power

spectrum of time series yt is a function of 
the frequency ω:
fy(!)=1
2⇡2
4γ0+21X
j=1γjcos(!j)3
50.
Here, γ0 is the variance of yt and γj the 
auto covariance of order j .4 Cycles with 
frequencies  for which the power spectrum 
assumes large values are more important 
for the dynamics of the time series than those 
with small values. The share of the area be-
tween two frequencies 0 ≤ _ ω < _ ω ≤ π  
below the power spectrum in the total area 
represents the share of the variance of the 
time series Yt caused by cycles from the 
selected  frequency interval.5 As is shown by 
the equation, the power spectrum is not 
time- varying, i.e. the analysis assumes that 
there is no change in the relative import-
ance of the various cycles for the time series 
over time (covariance stationarity).6
As an example, the chart on p. 58 shows 
the power spectra of an artifi  cially gener-
ated time series containing stochastic cycles 
having  a length of 16 and 48 observations 
(for quarterly data, four and 12 years).7 The 
time series Yt and the two stochastic cyc-
lical components contained therein are shown in the lower half of the chart. The 
spectrum peaks at frequencies of π/ 8 and 
π/ 24; these correspond to the cycle lengths 
contained in the time series.8
4 γj = E (Yt – µ)(Yt- j – µ)
5 The power spectrum can be estimated for a time 
series by, for instance, estimating the variance and the 
autocovariances of the time series and inserting the 
estimated values for γ0 and γj into the above equation 
or by estimating an ARMA(p,q) process for the time 
series and calculating the spectrum from the estimated 
ARMA coeffi   cients. See J.  Hamilton (1994), op. cit., 
pp. 163 ff.
6 A simple way to allow for time variability is by using 
a rolling window to estimate the power spectrum and 
other frequency analysis statistics. This approach, how-
ever, is ineffi   cient compared with the elaborated time- 
varying approach of wavelet analysis. See, for instance, 
the annex to this article and also A. Rua (2012), Wave-
lets in Economics, Economic Bulletin, Summer, Banco 
de Portugal, pp. 71-79.

T.  Trimbur (2003), General Model- Based Filters for 
Extracting  Cycles and Trends in Economic Time Series,

255.
8 The power spectrum in the chart can be calculated 
via the AR coeffi   cients of the time series. For an AR(2)

An AR(2) process taking on the general form yt = 2ρ

having the frequency ω. For the two cyclical compon-
ents of the time series Yt = y1,t + y2,t in the chart, it 
is assumed that ρ  = 0.9 ; ω1 = 2⇡

Bandpass ﬁ  lters extract the cycles falling 
within a pre- deﬁ  ned frequency range out of 
a time series which potentially contains 
multiple cycles of varying frequencies.9 For 
instance, the lower half of the chart shows 
the component extracted from the time ser-
ies Yt using such a procedure (the Baxter- 
King ﬁ  lter) with ﬂ  uctuations lasting between 
32 and 120 observations (for quarterly data, 
eight and 30 years).10 The above chart 
shows that the ﬁ  ltered time series corres-
ponds largely to the longer cycle compon-
ent.9 Standard ﬁ  lters used in practice include the Baxter- 
King, Christiano- Fitzgerald and Hodrick- Prescott ﬁ  lters.

cycles” at the frequencies generally associated with 
ﬁ  nancial  cycles or amplify weak cycles in this range.

tween eight and 20 years extracted using the 
popular Christiano- Fitzgerald filter for real loans 
by monetary financial institutions (MFIs) to 
households and non- financial corporations, as 
well as real house prices in Germany, France, 
Italy and Spain.23 The chart provides initial indi -
cations of cross- country synchronisation of 
cycles, in particular when it comes to loans to 
corporations.
Some other approaches to empirical modelling 
of the financial cycle do not involve pre- setting 
relevant cycle lengths and instead determine 
them on the basis of the data. Given that re -
search on the characteristics of financial cycles 
is still lagging behind the body of work done 
on business cycles, it seems prudent to avoid 
making assumptions about the relevant fre -
quencies as far as possible and to allow the 
data to “speak for themselves”.24 In this article, 
methods from wavelet analysis are employed 
with a view to pinpointing the frequency 
ranges relevant for financial cycles. This ap -
proach does not require pre-  specification of 
cycle length.25 Instead, the empirical analysis 
serves to reveal which cycle lengths are respon -
sible for the largest share of the variation in a 
given time series and for which periodicities 
there are common cycles with other variables. 
Moreover, wavelet analysis is a time- varying 
approach, meaning that it allows for changes 
in the relevant frequencies over time and does 
not assume that the characteristics of the fi -
nancial cycle remain constant over time. The 
annex beginning on p. 71 provides an overview 
of the wavelet analysis used here.26Wavelet

25 Schüler et al. (2015, 2017), op. cit., take a similar 
approach  . To construct their financial cycle indicator, they 
select the frequency range in which co- movements in the 
variables they have chosen are particularly pronounced and 
develop a new measure for this – power cohesion. Strohsal 
et al. (2015b), op. cit., use the power spectrum of the time 
series they analyse to set the frequency range.

Estimation results for the 
euro area
We begin by presenting below an analysis of 
the cross- country dimension of the euro area 
financial cycle using data on credit and house 
prices for selected euro area economies. The 
investigation is intended to reveal whether, and 
for which cycle lengths, common – i.e. cross-  
country – fluctuations can be discovered and 
whether and how the strength of their syn -
chronicity and their duration have changed 
over time. The discovery of pronounced syn -
chronised cycles would support the case for 
centralising or coordinating macroprudential 
policy. Following on from this, we explore 
whether there is a relationship between credit 
or house price cycles and cycles of real eco -
nomic activity. To what extent are financial 
cycles to be interpreted as a phenomenon de -
tached from real economic cycles?27
The analysis covers the economies of six euro 
area countries: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, 
the Netherlands and Spain.28 For these coun -
tries, relevant data are available as of 1980. 
However, for reasons of clarity, the results pre -
sented are often just those of the four large 
countries.29 The examined variables are real 
loans to non- financial corporations and house -
holds, real house prices, and, as a benchmark, 
real GDP . The nominal time series were deflated 
using the GDP deflator, i.e. converted into real 
values, and transformed and standardised into 
annual growth rates for the wavelet analysis.30
Application 1: Are there cross- country 
financial  cycles in loans and house prices 
in the euro area?
Indications of the importance of cross- country 
cycles in lending and house prices are provided 
by the “wavelet cohesion” of the variables 
across countries (see the chart on p. 64).31 This 
can be understood in simplified terms as a 
measure of the average pairwise synchronicity 
of the respective variables across countries, 
with the weighting of the pairwise results based on the countries’ real GDP . More de -
tailed information on the calculation is pro -
vided in the Annex. The chart shows the 
wavelet cohesion for all variables as a function 
of time (horizontal axis) and cycle length (verti -
cal axis).32 Cohesion can take on values of be -
tween minus one (black) and plus one (full syn -
chronisation, white), i.e. cohesion increases 
from darker to lighter colours. The black curved 
lines on the sides mark the area of interpretable 
results. Cohesion values outside this area 
should not be interpreted as they are subject to 
start point and end point problems (see p. 72). 
The light areas surrounded by black lines in the 
charts show the time frequency combinations 
where cohesion is statistically significantly dif -
ferent from zero (at the 10% level).
Loans to households show cohesion of close to 
zero, i.e. a relatively weak synchronisation 
across countries, up to the beginning of the 
1990s. Subsequently, the synchronisation of 
cycles of about four to over six years is signifi -
cantly more pronounced and cohesion rises to Analysis for

the dataset limits the maximum length of the cycles that 
can be assessed by means of wavelet analysis. For this rea -
son, the analysis only covers euro area countries for which 
data are available as of at least 1980 for all of the variables 
examined in the reference paper.

time.
32 In fact, the vertical axis shows the angular frequency of 
the cycles, which is standardised between π, the shortest 
cycle with two observations – i.e. a length of half a year for 
quarterly data – and zero, the longest cycle of infinite 
length. However, as maximum cycle lengths are limited by 
the length of the time series available for the fitting of the 
wavelet functions, the minimum angular frequency here is 
limited above zero. The inverse relationship between the 
angular frequency and the cycle length implies a non- linear 
scaling of the vertical axis after conversion to the oscillation 
period.Deutsche Bundesbank

Analysing the wavelet power spectra of credit aggregates, 
house prices and real gross domestic product in Germany
This box outlines how the wavelet power 
spectrum is used to analyse the cyclical 
characteristics of time series on credit, 
house prices and real gross domestic prod-
uct (GDP), as featured in the main text.
In the same way as the power spectrum 
described  in the box on p. 57, the wavelet 
power spectrum shows the relative import-
ance of various cycle lengths for the vari-
ance of a time series. By contrast, however, 
the level of importance can change over 
time, making the wavelet power spectrum 
time- varying.1 This means that the cycle 
lengths of the most important time series 
components can be determined for more 
in- depth analysis on the basis of the wave-
let power spectrum. In addition, it is pos-
sible to examine whether and how the 
length of the cycles of key importance to 
the time series changes over time. More-
over, the power spectra allow cross- checks 
to be carried out to determine whether 
common cross- country cycles derived using 
different methods are of any major import-
ance to the development of a given time 
series in a single country.
The chart on p.  62 illustrates the power 
spectra estimated using the wavelet ap-
proach regarding the annual growth rates 
of loans to households and to non- fi  nancial 
corporations, of house prices and of real 
GDP for Germany.2 The value of the power 
spectrum is colour coded for each combin-
ation of cycle length (vertical axis) and time 
(horizontal axis). Its value increases from 
black (zero) to white. The black and roughly 
horizontal lines link the wavelet power 
spectrum’s maxima over time. The black 
dashed and curved lines denote what is 
known as the cone of infl  uence. Only re-
sults for combinations of time and cycle length between the two lines can be inter-
preted. The reason for this is that the esti-
mate of the wavelet representation of the 
time series at each point in time includes 
both prior as well as future observations. As 
explained in the Annex on pp.  71ff., the 
length of this “window” is contingent on 
the frequency under review and widens as 
the length of the cycle increases.3 A suffi   -
cient number of observations in both time 
directions is available only for the estimates 
of the power spectrum between the two 
curved lines. As the cycle length increases, 
the “width of the window” expands and 
the period for which estimates can be made 
becomes continuously shorter as a conse-
quence. The results for the combinations of 
time and cycle length within the cone of 
infl  uence , i.e. those between the right (left) 
curved line and the right (left) border of the 
chart, suffer from start or end point prob-
lems and should not be interpreted.4
The wavelet power spectra for the variables 
exhibit considerable differences. Although 
credit and house prices each contain three 
dominant cycles, they have differing levels 
of stability and operate at different cycle

lengths. In the case of loans to households 
and house prices, the values for the power 
spectrum are stable and large in the lowest 
frequency range, while the values for loans 
to non- fi  nancial corporations are stable and 
large for cycles with a length of around ten 
years. For loans to households and house 
prices, local maxima of the spectrum can 
also be identifi  ed for cycles of between ten 
and 16 years; however, their importance di-
minishes over time. The situation is similar 
for cycle lengths of around fi  ve years for 
loans to non- fi  nancial corporations. While 
the power spectrum for the third and 
shorter cycle for house prices is relatively 
stable in terms of value, the cycle length in-creases over the course of the estimation 
period. The shorter cycles of loans to house-
holds and loans to non- fi  nancial corpor-
ations (with a duration of fi  ve or three 
years) are only of temporary importance.
In a comparison with credit and house 
prices, the lower right- hand section of the 
chart depicts the power spectrum of real 
GDP , which exhibits two dominant cycles. 
The fi  rst cycle has a length of around six 
years while the second, longer cycle, which 
initially has a length of just over ten years, 
converges towards the fi  rst cycle over time.1990 2000 2010161063Real loans to households1

values that are close to one. A similar develop -
ment is also apparent for cycles of about ten 
years in length, albeit with a lag. Overall, the 
synchronisation between the growth rates of 
MFI loans to households across the countries 
under review has increased over time.
For loans to non- financial corporations, the es -
timation shows stable cohesion of close to one 
throughout the entire period, both for cycles 
with a length of between eight and ten years 
and for those with a length of around 16 years. 
In the course of the 2000s, the synchronisation 
intensifies for shorter cycles. This could be due 
to the likewise increasingly strong synchronisa -
tion of real economic cycles (in the lower right- 
hand section of the chart) in these frequency 
bands.
Between the house price cycles of six to 16 
years there is a strong synchronisation across 
countries at the beginning of the estimation 
period. However, the cycle lengths with rela -
tively high cohesion narrow over time to about 
12-14 years in the late 1990s. In this narrower 
frequency band, cohesion is also statistically 
significant. Therefore, the results do not point 
to increasing synchronisation across countries 
over time for house prices.
The results for the three variables already show 
how important it is to avoid an a priori focus 
on a single frequency range for all variables. 
For example, the frequencies in which com -
mon, cross- country cycles occur differ between 
variables, and limiting cycle length to eight or 
more years would, for instance, ignore an im -
portant part of the common oscillations in 
loans to households. The narrowing of the 
band of cycle lengths with high cohesion in the 
case of house prices and the increase in cohe -
sion of cycles of loans to households illustrates 
the advantageousness of wavelet analysis, 
which can detect this time variability. Indicators 
based on estimates derived from fixed fre -
quency bands are therefore potentially prob -
lematic. This is particularly true if they are used 
for policy purposes.For the purpose of comparison, the last part of 
the chart on p. 64 presents the results of the 
cohesion analysis for real GDP . Here there is 
tight synchronisation between the cycles of the 
individual countries over a wide range of fre -
quencies. A relatively stable synchronisation is 
seen for cycles of around ten and around 16 
years. Moreover, from around 1990 onwards, 
there is also significant cohesion for shorter 
cycles, which are usually associated with busi -
ness cycles. This can be interpreted as evidence 
of increasing synchronisation between the 
business cycles of the observed countries over 
time.
Comparing the results for real GDP with those 
for the other variables, it is clear that common 
cycles of real GDP across countries cover a 
much wider frequency range than common 
cycles of the other variables. This is particularly 
true in comparison with house prices, for which 
common cross- country cycles cover only a nar -
row band. According to these results, cross-  
country cycles in the euro area for loans to 
households and house prices play a smaller role 
than for real GDP . Across countries, the finan -
cial cycle in the euro area for loans to house -
holds and house prices is thus less pronounced 
than the business cycle, meaning that the ra -
tionale for a single European macroprudential 
policy appears less obvious than for a single 
European monetary policy.
The cohesion analysis indicates that the cross-  
country synchronisation of all the variables 
considered increased over time, with the ex -
ception of house prices. One reason for this 
could be the start of European monetary union 
in the middle of the estimation period.
The above analysis relates to the average cross- 
country synchronisation of the variables’ cycles, 
measured by wavelet cohesion (see p. 74). The 
analysis focuses on the question of whether 
the cycles of the variables are synchronised 
or whether there is a lag between them, i.e. 
whether there is what is known as a phase 
shift. Given that Germany has the largest GDP Stable cross-

weight in the sample, the degree of synchron -
isation of the cycles in Germany with those of 
the other countries has a particularly strong im -
pact on the results of the cohesion analysis as 
the paired results are weighted according to 
the real GDP of the two respective countries.
The chart on p. 65 provides an impression of 
the relative positions of the cycles in the annual 
growth rates of the two credit aggregates and 
house prices in each country.33 A distinction is 
made here between cycles of six to ten years in 
length and cycles of between ten and 16 years. 
These frequencies cover the lengths of the 
most important cycles for each variable.34 In the chart, each cyclical component is displayed 
only over periods that are not affected by start 
and end point problems. For the longer cycles

33 For selected variables and frequency ranges, the cycles 
were calculated by inverting the estimated wavelet repre -
sentation of the time series for certain frequency ranges. In 
addition, the standardisation of data is reversed. The inver -
sion can be interpreted as a (two- sided) statistical filter 
which extracts components with the selected cycle lengths 
from the time series.

mates are available is therefore shorter.35 In 
addition to the estimated cycles for the four 
large countries, the chart also shows the cycles 
of the aggregate of all six countries, including 
Belgium and the Netherlands.36
As regards loans to households, it is apparent 
that the cycles of between ten and 16 years in 
Germany are substantially out of sync with 
those of other countries over most of the ob -
servation period, which, taken in isolation, re -
duces cohesion for this variable as shown in 
the chart on p. 64. While the shorter cycles of 
six to ten years in Germany are also initially out 
of sync with those of other countries, over time 
they increasingly converge towards the cycle 
of the aggregate, which contributes to the in -
crease in cohesion in this frequency band, as 
shown in the chart on p. 64.
The chart also shows that, for loans to non-  
financial corporations, the cycles with a length 
of six to ten years are relatively strongly syn -
chronised across countries, which is in line with 
the stable cohesion in this range shown in the 
chart on p. 64. Cycles in Germany have con -
verged over time towards the average cycle, 
while the amplitude in Spain has slightly in -
creased. For the longer cycles (ten to 16 years), 
a high level of synchronisation is apparent at 
the beginning of the period. However, the 
cycles later diverge somewhat, especially to -
wards the mid-2000s – with the credit boom in 
Spain, for example, being clearly visible. That 
said, at the end of the estimation period, the 
cyclical components converge once more.

35 As the length of time with interpretable results shrinks 
as cycle lengths increase, extending the analysis to cover 
even longer cycles makes little sense, given the length of 
the time series at hand. It would reduce the period of time 
for which interpretable results can be estimated and make 
it virtually impossible for conclusions to be drawn on the 
time variability of these relations.

cohesion in the chart on p. 64. The amplitude 
of house price cycles is noticeably smaller in 
Germany than in the other countries.37
The above table shows the standard deviations 
of the filtered time series for all variables and 
thus provides information on the average amp -
litude of the cycles. The amplitude of house 
price cycles is noticeably smaller in Germany 
than in the other countries. This also applies to 
the standard deviation of house price cycles 
relative to the standard deviation of GDP cycles 
(lower part of the table). The amplitudes of the 
cycles of loans to non- financial corporations 
are greater than those of loans to households 
in all of the countries. In general, both credit 
cycles and house price cycles exhibit a larger 
standard deviation than the GDP cycles:38 with 
the exception of house price cycles in Germany, 
the values in the lower part of the table are all 
greater than one.
A more precise assessment of cycles’ phase 
synchronisation across countries is made pos -
sible by the chart on p. 67. It shows the aver -
age time difference, i.e. the lead or lag in a 
country’s cycle compared to the GDP- weighted 
average of the cycles of the other countries, for 
the variables and frequency bands in the chart 
on p. 65. Positive time differences (vertical axis) represent a lead and negative differences rep -
resent a lag.
Consistent with the results of the cohesion an -
alysis, the time differences among cycles of 
loans to households with a length of between 
6 and 10 years are decreasing over time, i.e. 
the cycles are becoming more synchronised. 
For the longer cycles of between ten and 16 
years, the three other large countries are con -
verging towards the average cycle; Germany, 
however, has a cycle that is four to five years 
out of sync over the entire period. Due to Ger -
many’s large weight in the calculation of cohe -
sion, this presumably leads to cohesion remain -
ing relatively low, despite the increasing syn -
chronisation of the other countries. The time 
differences between the cycles of loans to non- 
financial corporations are for the most part less 
than one year, corroborating the finding of 
strong cross- country synchronisation in the co -
hesion analysis.Amplitude of

The estimated time differences for house price 
cycles point to some convergence over time. 
However, the time difference of cycles in Ger -
many to the average of the other countries is 
relatively large until the beginning of the 2000s. 
The subsequent major change in the phase 
shift in house price cycles in Germany goes 
hand in hand with a declining importance of 
these cycles (see p. 62). This implies rising esti -
mation uncertainty with regard to the time dif -
ference, which means that the change in the 
time difference should be interpreted with cau -
tion.
Overall, the analysis of the time differences 
supports the conclusions based on the meas -
ures of cohesion. Cycles of loans to non-  
financial corporations exhibit relatively stable 
and tight synchronisation across countries, 
while the synchronisation of loans to house -
holds has increased over time, especially for 
cycles of between six and ten years in length. 
As regards the longer cycles of loans to house -
holds, the discernible special role of Germany 
implies that the aggregate measure of cohe -
sion does not sufficiently reflect the link be -
tween the cycles of other countries.39 The time 
differences of house price cycles point to a 
slight convergence between countries.
Application 2: Relationship between 
financial  cycles and real economic cycles
The cohesion analysis has shown that the fre -
quency ranges in which there are cross- country 
cycles of real GDP also encompass frequency 
ranges in which there are common cycles of 
credit and house price growth. This also applies 
internally within countries, as real GDP growth 
also includes cyclical components of lengths 
similar to those found in the growth rates of 
credit and house prices.40 The chart on p. 68

nomic cycles and cycles of loans and house 
prices. It shows the wavelet coherence be -
tween the growth rates of the two credit ag -
gregates and house prices, on the one hand, 
and those of real GDP , on the other. This is a 
measure of the strength of the local correlation 
between two time series, depending on time 
and the cycle lengths considered, and can take 
values of between zero (no coherence) and 
one (perfect coherence).41
According to the estimates, the cycles of loans 
to households and loans to non- financial cor -
porations exhibit strong commonality with real 
GDP cycles. In the case of longer cycles, this is 
likely to reflect, in particular, the economy’s 
growing demand for funding as activity in -
creases. For Germany, the coherence of the 
cycles of between ten and 16 years for corpor -
ate loans is decreasing over time. However, this 
result is not very meaningful, as the cycles with 
the specified duration play only a minor role in 
the growth rate of corporate loans (see the 
chart and the text on p. 62).
The coherence between real GDP growth and 
growth in house prices is stable in Spain and 
close to one. By contrast, in Italy, but above all 
in Germany, there is a noticeable decline in co -
herence. In Germany, the result could reflect, 
inter alia, the weak growth in real house prices 
over the 2000s accompanied by a simultan -
eous acceleration of GDP growth as of 2003.42
Further analysis shows that within France, Italy 
and Spain, the two credit aggregates and 
house prices are strongly synchronised for cycle 
lengths of ten years or more. There is therefore 
another dimension to the financial cycle in 
these countries, namely common cycles of dif -
ferent variables within a country. As the vari -

correlated with real GDP cycles, it can be con -
cluded that cycles in real economic activity and 
financial cycles are potentially interdependent 
phenomena. In Germany, however, there is no 
similar synchronisation of cycles of loans and 
house prices, which means that from the point 
of view of this analysis, there is no pronounced 
evidence of a financial cycle in Germany in 
terms of a synchronisation of loans and house 
prices.
Assessment and outlook
The empirical results for the euro area pre -
sented above show correlations between vari -
ables within individual countries and across 
countries, but do not allow any direct conclu -
sions to be drawn with regard to the causali -
ties. Structural models are needed to infer 
causal relationships, for example between real 
economic cycles and financial cycles, to identify 
the causes of such cycles and to derive policy 
recommendations. The stylised facts obtained 
from this analysis and other empirical studies 
thus serve as a reference point for structural 
model analyses, which means that structural 
models should be able to reproduce the key 
characteristics of financial cycles in the data 
and their interaction with real economic 
cycles.43
The main empirical findings of the analysis pre -
sented are as follows:
– There are indications of cross- country cycles 
in the growth of credit aggregates and 
house prices.
– However, common cross- country cycles of 
these variables are less pronounced than 
those of real economic activity. This suggests 
that country- specific cycles are of consider -
able importance for credit growth, particu -
larly for loans to households, and for house 
price dynamics. Indeed, there are significant 
fluctuations in the variables at country level that are not covered by the cycle lengths of 
the identified common cycles.
– In comparison, coverage for cycles of real 
GDP is much greater, i.e. the common euro 
area business cycle is more important for 
GDP growth in the Member States than the 
common financial cycle is for growth in 
loans and house prices.
– The cycles of loans to households and of 
house prices in Germany differ significantly 
from those in the other countries.44 Further -
more, additional analyses do not provide 
strong evidence of common cycles for loans 
or property prices in Germany.
These results have implications for the proper 
orientation of macroprudential policy. In the 
euro area, responsibility for the use of macro -
prudential policy measures, such as the coun -
tercyclical capital buffer, is generally assigned at 
the national level. At the same time, macropru -
dential policy is embedded in an international 
framework of rules. An understanding of the 
synchronisation between national financial 
cycles is therefore essential for successful co -
ordination at the European and global level. 
The orientation of macroprudential policy in 
the euro area to country- specific developments 
is supported by the empirical findings pre -
sented above.
Another important finding is that credit growth, 
house price inflation and real GDP growth in 
the countries under review exhibit common 
medium-  term fluctuations. It can therefore be 
concluded that financial cycles and real eco -Descriptive

nomic cycles should not be regarded as inde -
pendent phenomena. However, the results do 
not allow any conclusions to be drawn on the 
direction of causality, i.e. whether these com -
mon cycles are caused predominantly by real 
economic or financial factors, or both. It is 
therefore likely that measures that aim to in -
crease the resilience of the financial system to 
systemic risks are also likely to have a real eco -
nomic impact.45 In this case, there can also be 
interactions between macroprudential policy 
and monetary policy.46 In the long term, macro -
prudential policies reinforce the framework 
conditions for a stability- oriented monetary 
policy by setting the right incentives and ensur -
ing sufficient resilience in the financial sector. 
Macroprudential policy should therefore be 
consistently focused on financial stability and 
should not be reinterpreted as a tool for 
demand- side management at the national 
level.47
Macroprudential policy has a number of instru -
ments to counteract systemic risks from exces -
sive credit and asset price booms. The use of 
these instruments requires indicators which 
allow for a timely assessment of the risk situ -
ation and which should therefore be available 
with as little delay as possible. These indicators, 
such as the credit-  to- GDP gap or the early 
warning indicator for systemic financial crises 
used at the Bundesbank,48 build on the results 
of empirical studies on financial cycles.49 How -
ever, it should also be noted that, because they 
are estimated metrics, financial cycle indicators 
are inherently uncertain, especially if they are 
identified in real time in order to support policy 
decisions and are intended to provide an esti -
mate that is as up to date as possible.50 Studies 
show that uncertainty in real- time estimates of 
financial cycles is of a comparable order of 
magnitude, in relation to cycle amplitude, to 
that in estimates of the business cycle or the 
output gap.51 The design of appropriate indica -tors therefore presents a similar challenge to 
estimating the macroeconomic output gap.

46 While price and financial stability are interdependent in 
the long term, there can be short to medium- term trade-  
offs between the two. For example, macroprudential in -
struments to mitigate risks in the financial system can 
counteract monetary policy objectives in the short to me -
dium term, and monetary policy measures, such as via the 
risk- taking channel, can temporarily put a strain on finan -
cial stability. For a detailed analysis of the relationship be -

50 The uncertainty regarding real time estimates of finan -
cial cycles has multiple components. The first is the general 
estimation or parameter uncertainty associated with any 
econometric estimation. Where filtering techniques are 
used, another component is filter uncertainty resulting 
from the absence of future observations at or near the cur -
rent end of the data. In the wavelet estimates, this problem 
is reflected in the non- interpretability of the border regions. 
This problem can be partially circumvented by using a one- 
sided filter or by extending the data with forecasts. How -
ever, both of these approaches lead to increased uncer -
tainty of the estimation results at the current end. Further -
more, data revisions may mean that estimates of the finan -
cial cycle turn out to be incorrect ex post. The uncertainty 
of real- time estimates has been discussed in the past mainly 
for estimates of the output gap, i.e. deviation of actual real 
GDP from equilibrium or potential output, or for estimates 
of the unemployment gap, i.e. the deviation of the un -
employment rate from the natural rate of unemployment.

Annex
An introduction to wavelet 
analysis 
Wavelet analysis is a tool for analysing time series 
within the frequency domain.52 It represents a re -
finement of spectral analysis to cover non- stationary 
time series, which are common in economic applica -
tions. While the conventional spectral analysis, 
which is based on the Fourier transform, works on 
the assumption that the importance for the variance 
of the time series of certain cycle lengths remains 
constant over time, the spectrum of the time series 
being constant, wavelet analysis allows for the spec -
trum to change over time. Accordingly, the same 
applies  to multivariate analyses. Wavelet analysis is 
therefore also suitable for studying changes in the 
relationship between multiple time series over time. 
Typically, variables containing trends are transformed 
into annual growth rates before applying the wave -
let analysis.
Unlike Fourier analysis, which is based on cycles with 
infinite support, wavelet analysis uses local base 
functions with finite support. The maximum length 
of cycles which can be examined is limited by the 
number of observations, i.e. the length of the under -
lying time series. A distinction is made between the 
discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and the continu -
ous wavelet transform (CWT). The discussion below 
will be confined to the CWT.53 A wavelet (mother 
wavelet) ψτ,s is characterised as a small wave as op -
posed to a sine function, which is a large wave
 ⌧,s(t)=1p
|s| ✓t⌧
s◆
,
where s is the scale and τ the localisation in time. A 
wavelet, in other words a wave function, must be 
different from zero within a certain range, i.e. it 
must exhibit both positive and negative elements 
(wave- like behaviour); at the same time, it must tend 
towards zero outside this range, otherwise it would 
not have finite support. The mother wavelet ψ can 
be compressed or stretched and shifted across the 
time axis in order to capture waves of different cycle 
lengths and at different points in time. In order to 
analyse longer cycles, the wavelet is stretched, 
whereas it is compressed to analyse shorter cycles. 
The larger the scaling parameter s, the more ψ is 
stretched and vice versa. As a consequence, wavelet 
analysis works with frequency- dependent window 
lengths, which means that more data points are in -cluded in estimations for longer cycles than for 
shorter ones.54
In the context of the CWT, a specific wavelet func -
tion, known as the Morlet wavelet,55 which pos -
sesses certain desirable characteristics, is used very 
frequently. The Morlet wavelet is defined as:
 !0(t)=⇡1/4⇣
ei!0te1
2!2
0⌘
et2/2.
The second term in brackets is negligible for ω0 > 5 
and is disregarded in the following, implying that:
 !0(t)=⇡1/4ei!0tet2/2.
The first term is a normalisation factor, the second 
term a complex sine curve, and the last term the 
Gaussian bell curve. An optimal time- frequency lo -
calisation for the decomposition of a time series is 
obtained for ω0 = 6. In addition, this value implies a 
direct relationship between scale and frequency 
(ω � 1/s).
The Morlet wavelet, with ω0 = 6, is shown in the 
chart on p. 72. It can be described as a complex sine 
wave modulated by a Gaussian function, which 
means that the wavelet is, at the centre, equivalent 
to a complex sine wave. Closer to the borders, there 
is a steady decrease in oscillation, ultimately conver -
ging towards the value of zero. The chart depicts the

series, see the box on pp.  56 ff. For an introduction to 
wavelet analysis, see, for example, A. Rua (2012), Wavelets

The Continuous Wavelet Transform: Moving Beyond Uni- 
and Bivariate Analysis, Journal of Economic Surveys, 
Vol. 28, pp. 344-375.
53 Unlike the CWT, the DWT only stretches or shifts wave -
lets by discrete numerical values. In the extreme case of the 
dyadic approach, a factor of two is applied in the stretch -
ing process.
54 In conventional spectral analysis, time variation can be 
taken into account through what is referred to as a win -
dowed Fourier transform. The calculation of the spectrum 
does not include the entire time series, but instead only 
observations within a window of fixed length, which is 
shifted along the time axis. Adjusting the window length in 
the wavelet analysis in accordance with the frequency 
leads, by comparison, to a higher resolution for low fre -
quencies in the frequency dimension, and for short cycles 
in the time dimension; see A. Rua (2012), op. cit.

with ω0 = 6, with a cosine wave spanning a cycle 
length of twenty quarters.56
The upper chart on p.  73 shows how, once the 
Morlet  wavelet is substituted in the first equation, 
the wavelet function can be stretched or – as in the 
example – compressed by changing s and shifted 
across time by changing τ. The left side of the chart 
illustrates how the Morlet wavelet is scaled to adjust 
to higher frequencies. The right side illustrates the 
shift of the Morlet wavelet across the time axis.
The CWT of a time series is obtained by projecting 
the time series x(t) onto the wavelet function ψ57

dt,
where  * denotes the complex conjugate wavelet 
function. The transform is calculated for all combin -
ations of scales s and points in time t. It measures 
the correlation between the time series x(t) and the 
wavelet in question. The more the two resemble 
each other, the higher the value of Wx(τ,s).
The wavelet power spectrum (WPS) represents the 
relative contribution made by the various cycles to 
the total variance of the time series for each scale 
and point in time. It is defined as:
WPS x(⌧,s)= |Wx(⌧,s)|2.
The higher the value of the power spectrum, the 
more important the fluctuations are in the corres -ponding frequency range at the relevant point in 
time.
For the purposes of illustration, the bottom chart 
on p. 73 shows a simulated time series containing a 
structural break in period 50, after which the cycle 
length changes from four to eight years. The esti -
mated power spectrum based on the Fourier trans -
form, which does not allow for time variation, cap -
tures both cycles. It is not clear, however, whether 
the two cycles move simultaneously across the entire  
period or whether a change has taken place over 
time. The WPS can provide information on the mat -
ter.58 It is depicted as a heatmap with power spec -
trum values increasing from dark to light colours. 
The curved lines mark the boundaries of what is 
referred  to as the cone of influence. The number of 
observations close to the borders is insufficient to 
accurately calculate the wavelet coefficients, due to 
which only the results within the two lines should be 
interpreted. The black and largely horizontal lines 
show the key cycle lengths (local maxima of the 
WPS). It is discernible that a structural break oc -
curred midway through the observation period.
The interaction between two time series x(t) and 
y(t) can be analysed by means of the cross- wavelet 
transform
Wxy(⌧,s)=W x(⌧,s)W⇤
y(⌧,s).
Given that the Morlet wavelet is complex, the cross- 
wavelet transform, too, exhibits complex values.
This allows phase shifts and phase differences be -
tween two time series, i.e. lead- lag relationships, to 
be analysed. The phase angle of a time series is de -
fined as:
'x(⌧,s)=t a n1I{W x(⌧,s)}
R{Wx(⌧,s)}�
 ,
where R{Wx} is the real and I{Wx} is the imagin -
ary part of the wavelet transform Wx. The phase 
angle indicates the oscillation position of the time 
series for a specific time- frequency combination. In Morlet wavelet versus cosine wave*

IFRS 9 from the perspective of banking 
supervision
Since the beginning of the 2018 financial year, publicly traded credit institutions in the EU have 
been required to apply the new International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 9 when account -
ing for financial instruments in their consolidated financial statements. IFRS 9 was developed in 
response to G20 criticism about accounting standards during the course of the financial crisis, 
which singled out the late and insufficient recognition of loss allowances (“too little, too late”). 
In contrast to the incurred loss approach under the previous International Accounting Standard 
(IAS) 39, IFRS 9 now requires preparers to account for expected credit losses.
Implementation of the new impairment model is changing the way in which credit institutions 
that prepare their financial statements in conformity with IFRSs draw up their accounts. Further -
more, in some cases, they can now exercise considerable discretion when calculating their 
expected credit losses. How banks utilise this discretion is also a topic that concerns banking 
supervisors, who have a vested interest in timely and appropriate provisioning and in balance 
sheets that enable credit institutions to be assessed on as level a playing field as possible.
At the transition date, German institutions saw a moderate rise in their loss allowances of just 
under 6% on average as well as a decline in their Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratios of 
11 basis points. It will only be possible to gauge whether any adjustments to the regulatory treat -
ment of accounting loss allowances will be needed in the long term once robust data are forth -
coming. German institutions have so far not made use of the transitional arrangements allowing 
them to phase in the impact of IFRS 9 on regulatory capital.
There is generally no need to amend the relevant accounting rules set forth in the German Com -
mercial Code (HGB), as this set of rules already implicitly contains the option of taking into 
account forward- looking components in the form of the principle of prudence as well as the con -
cept of setting aside general loss allowances.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
The international accounting standards for fi -
nancial instruments attracted mounting criti -
cism as the global financial crisis unfolded. A 
majority view emerged that if impairments had 
been accounted for earlier, it might have been 
possible to dampen cyclical moves in the crisis.1 
The recognition of loss allowances on financial 
assets in conformity with the existing account -
ing standards at that time, meanwhile, was de -
scribed by many as “too little, too late”. Add -
itional criticism was sparked by the variety of 
permissible measurement methods, which gave 
the accounting framework a reputation for 
being too complex and having little basis in 
principle. This was the background against 
which the G20 heads of state and government, 
in analysing and learning from the financial cri -
sis, called for a reform of the accounting stand -
ards, amongst other things, in April 2009.2
Following intensive deliberations and consult -
ations, the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB) ultimately responded to the G20’s 
call to action on 24  July 2014 by publishing 
IFRS 9 as the new standard for accounting for 
financial instruments. The most significant in -
novation is the introduction of the expected 
credit loss (ECL) model when recognising loss 
allowances, which aims to promote the earlier 
recognition of credit risk. Another change 
introduced a principles- based approach to clas -
sifying and measuring financial assets in an 
effort  to reduce the number of measurement 
methods and make financial reporting more 
comprehensible. Lastly, in the area of hedge 
accounting, the IASB made adjustments to 
align financial reporting more closely with risk 
management practice.
The new IFRS 9 standard was endorsed by the 
EU in November 2016 through Commission 
Regulation (EU) 2016/ 2067, and its application 
became mandatory on 1 January 2018 for all 
publicly traded entities when accounting for 
finan cial instruments in their consolidated 
finan cial statements. Since both securities and loans are considered to be financial instruments 
for the purposes of IFRS 9, it is highly relevant 
for the accounting of credit institutions.
The annual and consolidated financial state -
ments of credit institutions and external audit -
ors’ reports on these financial statements are 
some of the most important sources of infor -
mation for the Bundesbank in performing its 
mandate to contribute to preserving the stabil -
ity of the banking system. Supervisors use the 
information contained in annual and consoli -
dated financial statements, and in the supervis -
ory reporting based on them, to assess the risk 
situation as part of the ongoing supervision of 
credit institutions. Furthermore, the carrying 
amounts reported by institutions form the basis 
for determining the adequacy of their regula -
tory capital. It is therefore in the interest of 
supervisors that credit institutions recognise 
existing risks in a timely manner and take 
proper consideration of them in their accounts. 
For this reason, the Bundesbank, like other cen -
tral banks and supervisory authorities, closely 
followed the development and implementation 
of IFRS 9. The objective was to gain a thorough 
grasp of the impact of the new standard and to 
work towards ensuring that its implementation 
does indeed address the G20’s points of criti -
cism and contribute to the stability of the bank -
ing system.
Key requirements of IFRS 9
To push the development of the new account -
ing standard ahead as quickly as possible, the 
IASB divided work on IFRS  9 into three project 
phases. Phase 1 revised the rules for recognis -
ing and measuring financial instruments, 
phase 2 introduced an overhauled impairment IFRS 9 as a 
response to the 
financial crisis

model, and phase 3 was dedicated to hedge 
accounting.
Recognition and measurement 
of financial instruments
The oft- criticised complexity of the accounting 
standards, with the patchwork of measure -
ment methods and associated rules, should be 
reduced under IFRS 9 by way of a principles-  
based approach that sets forth two central cri -
teria for classifying financial assets (IFRS 9.4.1.1): 
first, the type of business model for managing 
the financial assets, and second, the contract -
ual cash flow characteristics of the financial 
assets. This is based on the notion that, for 
users of financial statements, the usefulness of 
the information provided by the various meas -
urement methods depends on the manner in 
which an entity generates revenue using its 
assets. Representatives from credit institutions, 
especially, argued that the accounting stand -
ards ought to take account of cases in which 
financial instruments are held, for example, 
with the aim of collecting interest payments 
that are fixed when the contract is concluded. 
In such cases, they claimed, it was questionable 
whether fair value accounting, for example, 
provided users with relevant information.
As a result, IFRS 9 continues to classify financial 
assets in a number of measurement categories 
in which different methodologies are used to 
determine their carrying amounts (“mixed at -
tribute approach”). The main change is that, in 
principle, only the two classification criteria 
mentioned above are to be assessed.
Where financial assets are held in order to col -
lect their contractual cash flows and these are 
solely payments of principal and interest, they 
are to be assigned to category (1) “Amortised 
cost (AC)”. IFRS 9 mentions a basic lending 
arrange ment as one example of this type of 
finan cial instrument. For this reason, credit in -
stitutions’ traditional lending business typically 
falls under this measurement category.If, alongside the collection of contractual cash 
flows, the sale of financial assets with corres -
ponding cash flow characteristics is also an in -
tegral part of an entity’s business model, the 
financial assets are to be categorised under (2) 
“Fair value through other comprehensive in -
come (FVOCI) – with recycling”. In addition, 
since the contractual cash flows from the assets 
in this category are solely payments of principal 
and interest, interest revenue calculated using 
the effective interest method is recognised in 
profit or loss. Securities held in the liquidity 
reserve , for example, can be allocated to this 
category.
As a general rule, equity instruments cannot be 
assigned to categories (1) “Amortised cost” or 
(2) “FVOCI – with recycling” as their cash flows, 
by definition, are not payments of principal and 
interest. For equity instruments not held for 
trading, however, IFRS  9 does offer entities the 
option of assigning them to category (3) “Fair

that it added this option because users of finan-
cial statements assess the fair value changes of 
equity instruments differently depending, for 
example, on whether the instruments are in -
tended to serve as a strategic investment or to 
generate short- term gains. By presenting fair 
value gains and losses separately in other com -
prehensive income (OCI), it should therefore be 
easier to assess changes in the fair value of 
equity investments not held for trading. Recyc -
ling of fair value gains and losses into profit or 
loss is prohibited as, according to the IASB, this 
would create the need to routinely assess these 
equity investments for impairment, and it was 
precisely the impairment rules for equity instru -
ments that had been criticised during the finan -
cial crisis for being subjective. The IASB has 
opted to proceed pragmatically on this score.
The residual measurement category under 
IFRS 9 is category (4) “Fair value through profit 
or loss (FVPL)”. At the onset of the debate re -
garding overhauling the accounting standards, 
the IASB still held the opinion that fair value 
was the only measurement attribute that was 
appropriate for all types of financial instru -
ments. However, there was opposition to ex -
panding fair value accounting, including from 
the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, 
which argued that a large proportion of busi -
ness is not managed on the basis of fair value, 
especially among smaller credit institutions. As 
a compromise, IFRS 9 therefore contains provi -
sions to identify assets for which relevant and 
useful information can be obtained by measur -
ing them using the effective interest method. 
The only assets to be recognised at fair value 
through profit or loss (FVPL) are those which 
cannot be assigned to any of the other cat -
egories (1 to 3) due to the entity’s business 
model and/ or the characteristics of their cash 
flows. One example of this is financial assets 
held for trading, which, by definition, also in -
clude derivatives.
Besides classifying financial assets based on the 
two criteria mentioned above, IFRS 9 retains the option of designating financial assets upon 
initial recognition as measured at fair value 
through profit or loss if doing so would elimin -
ate or significantly reduce an accounting mis -
match. By contrast, the IASB concluded that 
the fair value option was unnecessary for finan -
cial assets managed on a fair value basis or for 
those with embedded derivatives because 
IFRS 9 requires these assets to be assigned to 
category (4) “Fair value through profit or loss 
(FVPL)”.
IFRS 9 does not include any principles compar -
able to those for financial assets for the classifi -
cation of financial liabilities. Instead, the previ -
ous accounting rules were left largely un -
changed, with the result that measurement at 
amortised cost is the default (IFRS 9.4.2.1). 
Liabil ities held for trading, including all deriva -
tive liabilities and liabilities for which the fair 
value option is exercised, are subject to FVPL 
accounting. Concerning the fair value option, 
IFRS 9 introduced the requirement to present in 
OCI the amount of change in the fair value of a 
financial liability that is attributable to the 
change in the reporting entity’s own credit risk.
In summary, while IFRS 9 does not reduce the 
number of accounting methods for financial in -
struments in any great way, its principles- based 
approach to classifying assets does introduce a 
stringent concept which replaces much of the 
complex and unclear rules- based requirements 
that were in place previously. From the per -
spective of banking supervision, clear and con -
sistent implementation of this new concept is 
vital, since classification determines how the 
risks arising from financial assets affect the bal -
ance sheet. In category (1) “Amortised cost”, 
impairments of financial assets are only recog -
nised if they are the result of credit risk. 
Changes in value caused by market risk, by 
contrast, continue to be disregarded.3 Market 
risk is, however, relevant when financial instru -
ments are leveraged or to be sold, which can FVPL as a

expose the expected cash flows to negative 
factors. These financial instruments are there -
fore excluded from amortised cost accounting. 
Impairments resulting from credit risk are rec -
ognised according to the impairment require -
ments described below.
Loss allowances based on 
expected  credit losses
Under IFRS 9, loss allowances are established 
on the basis of a model that recognises ex -
pected credit losses (ECL model). The ECL 
model differs fundamentally from previous 
practice under IAS 39, where the incurred loss 
approach only required allowances to be rec -
ognised after a loss event had taken place.
The new requirements apply to financial assets 
in categories (1) “Amortised cost” and (2) 
“FVOCI – with recycling”, and to lease receiva -
bles, loan commitments and financial guaran -
tee contracts. The introduction of a single im -
pairment model for these financial instruments 
marks a major improvement over the IAS 39 
regime, which had multiple impairment models 
for the various measurement categories and 
had therefore been criticised for its complexity. 
IFRS 9 now requires the three- stage model 
depicted  overleaf to be applied uniformly to all 
these financial instruments and a loss allow -
ance to be recognised through profit and loss 
at each reporting date. The stage to which a 
financial instrument is assigned depends on 
how its credit risk has evolved since initial rec -
ognition. The criteria for transferring a financial 
instrument from one stage to another are to be 
applied  symmetrically – in other words, all else 
being equal, deteriorations in credit quality 
should prompt a transfer to a higher stage just 
as improvements in credit quality should result 
in a transfer to a lower stage.
Stage 1 comprises all financial instruments 
whose credit risk has not increased significantly 
since their initial recognition. A loss allowance 
equal to the 12- month expected credit losses (12- month ECL) needs to be recognised for 
each of these financial instruments. The 12-  
month ECL represent the credit losses arising 
from a potential debtor default within the next 
twelve months, weighted by the respective risk 
of a default occurring.4 Interest revenue from 
financial assets at this stage is calculated on the 
basis of the gross carrying amount.
Stage 2 of the new impairment model com -
prises all financial instruments whose credit risk 
has increased significantly since their initial 
recog nition. To determine whether credit risk 
has increased significantly, the risk of a default 
occurring over the remaining lifetime of the 
finan cial instrument is compared with the risk 
of a default occurring that was originally 
expected  for the same time period when the 
finan  cial instrument was initially recognised 
(forward probability of default, or forward PD).5 
It is appropriate for this comparison to also 
consider the absolute change in the risk of a 
default occurring in order to avoid overlooking 
a significant increase simply because the 
change does not appear significant in relation 
to an already high level of credit risk.
For stage 2 financial instruments, credit institu -
tions recognise loss allowances at an amount 
equal to the lifetime expected credit losses (life -
time ECL). These are the credit losses arising 
from a potential debtor default over the finan -
cial instrument’s lifetime weighted with the risk 
of a default occurring. In the IASB’s view, rec -
ognition of lifetime ECL is appropriate here be -
cause a significant increase in credit risk means 
that an economic loss has been incurred. This 
loss is caused by the fact that, for most finan -
cial instruments, the interest rate, and espe -
cially the credit risk premium, are not adjusted 
to changes in the credit risk during their life -ECL model for

event occurring within the next twelve months.
5 A simple comparison with the risk of a default occurring 
over the total expected lifetime as at initial recognition is 
not sufficient as the risk of a default occurring over the 
remain ing lifetime typically diminishes over time.Deutsche Bundesbank

time. In the event of a significant increase in 
credit risk, it is therefore not appropriate to use 
the 12- month ECL as a proxy for the expected 
credit loss, and lifetime ECL should be used in -
stead.
Finally, stage 3 of the ECL model comprises 
credit- impaired financial assets. A significant 
deterioration in the credit quality of these 
assets is observable in that one or more serious 
events have occurred that have had a detri -
mental impact on the estimated future cash 
flows of those assets. The examples of such 
events listed in IFRS 9 are much the same as the 
examples of loss events in IAS 39 and include, 
for example, significant financial difficulty of 
the debtor, and interest or principal payments 
that are substantially past due.
Reporting entities are required to recognise loss 
allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL 
for stage 3 financial assets. However, unlike at 
stages 1 and 2, interest revenue is calculated 
on the basis of the net carrying amount, i.e. 
the exposure amount net of loss allowances. 
The reason for this change in calculation meth -
odology is that, following the significant in -
crease in credit risk, the gap between the con -
tractual payments and the payments that are 
actually expected becomes so wide that calcu -
lating interest revenue on the basis of the gross carrying amount would no longer faithfully 
represent the economic return. For the same 
reason, interest revenue from impaired finan -
cial assets was already calculated on the basis 
of the net carrying amount under IAS 39.
When measuring the loss allowances at the 
various stages, and when determining a signifi -
cant increase in credit risk, reporting entities 
are to consider all reasonable and supportable 
information that is available without undue 
cost or effort.6 Unlike under IAS 39, this wide 
range of information also includes forward-  
looking data such as forecasts of future eco -
nomic conditions. IFRS 9 expects reporting 
entities  to reflect this forward- looking informa -
tion in scenario analyses that are used when 
calculating the amount of the loss allowances. 
At least one scenario should consider the pos -
sibility that a credit loss occurs. Beyond these 
requirements, reporting entities are generally 
free to choose the methods they use to calcu -
late loss allowances and identify significant in -
creases in credit risk.7Stage 3 similar

Hedge accounting
In the area of hedge accounting, the IASB 
sought to develop a more principles- based ap -
proach and align the accounting requirements 
more closely with risk management practice. 
One major innovation is that effectiveness test -
ing has been made more flexible. The time-  
consuming requirement to demonstrate that 
micro hedges always are within the 80% to 
125% effectiveness range has been removed. 
Instead, hedge effectiveness is assessed on the 
basis of an economic analysis that uses internal 
risk management data.8
Critical appraisal of new 
accounting  requirements
The key features of IFRS 9 are the requirement 
to take forward- looking information into ac -
count and the introduction of stage 2 of the 
ECL model. From the perspective of banking 
supervisors, the early and – in comparison to 
IAS 39 – “additional” recognition of loss allow -
ances is generally to be welcomed. Credit insti -
tutions are now required to reflect relevant in -
formation about changes in credit risk in their 
financial statements in a timely manner and 
therefore also take it into account when calcu -
lating their regulatory capital.
What is problematic is the considerable discre -
tionary leeway which the new ECL model in 
particular brings for reporting credit institu -
tions. For instance, the credit institutions them -
selves get to determine when there has been a 
significant increase in credit risk. The IASB con -
sciously avoided writing a specific requirement 
as credit risk is calculated using different 
methods and a blanket requirement cannot 
properly reflect the differences between the 
various types of firms, sectors and geographical 
regions. Credit institutions can likewise use a 
great deal of judgement when it comes to cal -
culating credit risk, such as the manner in 
which they model risk parameters and select 
the underlying input factors. The estimation of future cash flows is, by its very nature, another 
activity that is fraught with uncertainties, espe -
cially if it is to consider assumptions about 
future  economic developments. Here, too, 
credit institutions can use their discretion in 
considering issues such as how historical loss 
experience is to be adjusted to future condi -
tions and which indicators should be used as 
inputs when forecasting these future condi -
tions. These numerous forms of discretionary 
scope give rise to the risk that, in practice, dis -
crepancies will emerge in the implementation 
of IFRS 9, making it more difficult to compare 
one credit institution’s financial statements 
with another’s. This also impacts on the activ -
ities of banking supervisors, as their efforts to 
assess the risk situation include comparing and 
contrasting financial statements across credit 
institutions.
Challenges for credit 
institutions 
Banking supervisors are keeping a very close 
eye on how credit institutions implement 
IFRS 9. They want to see that credit institutions 
have adequate processes in place for establish -
ing appropriate levels of loss allowances9 and 
that accounting standards are implemented 
such that they are able to assess institutions on 
as level a playing field as possible. For this rea -
son, banking supervisors in Europe conducted 
a series of projects on IFRS  9 with a view to 
fostering the consistent implementation of the 
standard. These initiatives explored which parts 
of the new accounting requirements come 
with specific challenges for credit institutions 
and how key prudential metrics are expected 
to be affected.Hedge account -

In two joint impact assessments by the EBA 
and national supervisory authorities, 58 institu -
tions were surveyed at year- end 2015, and 54 
at year- end 2016, regarding the stage of imple -
mentation and the impact of IFRS 9.10 The insti -
tutions surveyed in both studies pointed to in -
sufficient data quality in some cases and a lack 
of data for determining a significant increase in 
credit risk and for calculating expected credit 
losses as the greatest challenges. Moreover, 
many institutions reported that they leveraged 
regulatory models to estimate expected credit 
losses, yet adapting these to incorporate 
forward- looking information was a complex 
task. In consideration of these and other obser -
vations, the EBA issued a number of recom -
mendations it believes to be key to robust im -
plementation of IFRS  9. One such recommen -
dation highlights the importance of applying a 
consistent methodology when making use of 
approximations for accounting purposes.
With regard to the expected impact on the 
prudential metrics, the surveyed institutions re -
ported that the new impairment requirements 
resulted in a reduction of the Common Equity 
Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio. Institutions across 
Europe expected an average decline in the 
CET1 capital ratio of 45 basis points (in the first 
study: 59 basis points). One- quarter of the in -
stitutions surveyed even expected a decline of 
at least 75 basis points (in both studies). Loss 
allowances were expected to rise by an aver -
age of 13% (first study: 18%), with one- quarter 
of institutions projecting an increase of at least 
18% (first study: 30%).
Besides the EBA, the supervisory authorities 
that make up the Single Supervisory Mechan -
ism (SSM) also investigated in 2017 how credit 
institutions were prepared for the application 
of IFRS 9 (ECB Thematic Review). This review 
covered 106 significant institutions (SIs) and 77 
less significant institutions (LSIs).11 The SIs were 
assessed in the first quarter of 2017 by the joint 
supervisory teams (JSTs), which considered the 
extent to which preparations for IFRS 9 were 
consistent with the predefined expectations of supervisors. The SIs were informed in writing 
and during the supervisory dialogue of any 
findings and remedial actions, and the JSTs also 
followed up on outstanding issues from the 
Thematic Review after IFRS 9 came into effect 
in 2018. LSIs were investigated using self-  
assessments based on the EBA’s impact assess -
ment exercises. All the institutions surveyed felt 
the greatest challenge to be the implementa -
tion of the new impairment regime, where 
supervisors noted, amongst other things, the 
insufficient documentation on the processes 
for including forward- looking information, plus 
room for improvement in developing the valid -
ation and back- testing processes. The SIs calcu -
lated that the expected quantitative impact of 
IFRS 9 would push down the CET1 capital ratio 
by 40 basis points on average, with around 
one- quarter of the institutions estimating an 
effect of at least 50 basis points. The LSIs, 
meanwhile, forecasted a reduction of 59 basis 
points, although this number was heavily influ -
enced by negative outliers as more than three- 
quarters of these institutions reported that they 
were only expecting a decline of 25 basis points 
at most.
The actual impact on own 
funds and loss allowances
Most of the studies available thus far were 
carried  out before IFRS 9 was applied for the 
first time, meaning that they are only based on 
estimations. Since 1  January 2018, however, 
credit institutions have had to implement the 
new standard in their actual accounting prac -
tices. The Bundesbank has analysed how the 
initial application of IFRS 9 has impacted on 
those German credit institutions which prepare Data quality and

their financial statements in conformity with 
IFRSs.
In Germany, a total of 24 credit institutions 
were preparing their consolidated financial 
statements in conformity with IFRSs at the end 
of 2017. The sample examined excludes 11 in -
stitutions that were either a subgroup of an -
other institution already included in the sam -
ple, or because their size and business model 
had negligible significance for the banking 
market, or because they were undergoing a 
substantial restructuring process. The final sample 
comprises 13 institutions which were assessed 
at the highest level of consolidation in Ger -
many. These institutions’ aggregate total assets 
amounted to around €4.25 trillion, equivalent 
to around 94% of the consolidated total assets 
of the German credit institutions that prepare 
their financial statements in conformity with 
IFRSs. Data on the impact of first- time applica -
tion of IFRS 9 on these selected institutions 
were gathered from their published consoli -
dated financial statements and Pillar 3 disclos -
ure reports for 2017 and from their semi- annual 
financial reporting as at 30 June 2018. Where 
data were not publicly available, the institu -
tions were asked to provide internal figures.
To determine the overall impact of IFRS 9, Bun -
desbank analysts compared the institutions’ 
CET1 capital ratios as at 31  December 2017 
and 1 January 2018 without application of the 
supervisory transitional arrangements permit -
ted under the European Capital Requirements 
Regulation (CRR) (“fully loaded”).12 Since the 
relevant data were lacking for four of the insti -
tutions as per at least one of the reporting 
dates, this part of the investigation only touches 
on nine institutions. The Bundesbank found 
that first- time application of IFRS 9 reduced the 
“fully loaded” CET1 capital ratio by just 11 basis 
points on average.13
The chart above shows that the change in the 
“fully loaded” CET1 capital ratio in the sample 
has a wide margin, ranging from a drop of 80 
basis points to an increase of 70 basis points. One notable reason why some institutions saw 
their CET1 capital ratios increase is that finan -
cial assets are measured at fair value under 
IFRS 9, but at amortised cost under the previous 
regime.14 For the bulk of the institutions under 
review, the “fully loaded” CET1 capital ratio fell 
only marginally, if at all, on 1  January 2018. 
There are, however, also isolated cases in which 
this key prudential metric comes under more 
distinct pressure, as had been projected ahead 
of IFRS 9 implementation, especially on account 
of the new impairment regime, for European 
credit institutions in the investigations by the 
EBA and the ECB.
Information on the impact of the new impair -
ment regime was provided by all 13 institutions 
in the sample. First- time application of IFRS 9 
increased loss allowances by 5.9% on aver -
age.15 How each institution fared is shown in

allow ances decreased in some cases. This out -
come is notably due to the fact that the Bun -
desbank’s analysis looks at the net change in 
loss allowances, which includes the impact 
from both the new ECL model and changes in 
the stock of financial assets which are subject 
to the impairment requirements. Because of 
the new classification approach, some institu -
tions have reclassified financial assets to the 
FVPL category, which covers, for instance, ship -
ping loans that are now to be sold if a favour -
able opportunity were to arise. No loss allow -
ances need to be recognised under the ECL 
model for financial assets classified to the FVPL 
category; instead, changes in value are recog -
nised directly in the assets’ fair values. How -
ever, the reversal  of loss allowances as a result 
of reclassifications should not generally cause 
an increase in equity as the circumstances that 
led to loss allowances being set aside in the 
first place reduce the fair value at the same 
time.16
All in all, the actual impact of IFRS 9 is moder -
ate for most of the 13 German institutions that 
were examined. The effect on the CET1 capital 
ratio and the change in allowance levels are 
lower than the figures forecast by the Euro -
pean institutions in the earlier impact assess -
ment exercises by the EBA and the ECB.Regulatory guidelines on 
accounting  for expected 
credit losses
One cornerstone of the various assessments 
performed by German and European author -
ities in the context of IFRS 9 was the supervis -
ory expectations regarding the implementation 
of the new ECL accounting requirements, 
which have been set out by the Basel Commit -
tee on Banking Supervision. The Committee 
looked at the standard in great detail immedi -
ately after it was finalised with the purpose of 
mapping out ways to promote consistent im -
plementation of the new rules. The outcome of 
these deliberations saw the Committee update 
its guidelines on sound credit risk assessment 
and valuation for loans from 2006 and rename 
them “Guidance on credit risk and accounting 
for expected credit losses”.17
Published in December 2015, the revised guide -
lines articulate supervisory expectations with 
regard to credit risk management processes 
and procedures as a basis for determining ECL 
allowances. They draw special attention to the 
need for robust consideration of relevant, rea -
sonable and supportable forward- looking in -
formation as the key component of ECL ac -
counting models. Particular emphasis is also 
placed on the responsibility of the board and 
management, both of whom are responsible 
for ensuring that their institution has appropri -
ate credit risk practices (including an effective 
system of internal control) to consistently de -
termine adequate loss allowances in accord -
ance with the applicable accounting frame -
work and relevant supervisory guidance. Other

Current regulatory treatment of accounting loss allowances
There are around 40 credit institutions in 
Germany – mostly large ones – that use the 
internal ratings- based (IRB) approach. This 
approach allows credit institutions to calcu-
late their capital requirements for credit risk 
based on their own internal parameter esti-
mates. These estimates are needed for the 
calculation of the regulatory expected loss 
(regulatory EL) amount, which serves, on 
the one hand, as a credit risk provisioning 
fl  oor and, on the other, as an input in the 
calculation of risk weights. However, the 
approach applied exclusively by the majority 
of credit institutions is the simpler standard-
ised approach for credit risk (CRSA), where 
no regulatory EL amount is determined and 
risk weights are calibrated by banking 
supervisors. Unsurprisingly, then, the IRB 
approach and the CRSA differ in a number 
of ways in terms of their conceptual basis and design, including how they each treat 
accounting loss allowances (provisions).
The CRSA makes a distinction between 
specifi  c  and general credit risk adjustments. 
Specifi  c credit risk adjustments are de-
ducted from the exposure value, so the 
higher the accounting loss allowances in 
the form of specifi  c credit risk adjustments, 
the lower the risk- weighted assets (RWAs). 
By contrast, general credit risk adjustments 
do not reduce RWAs but can be included in 
Tier 2 capital, though only up to 1.25% of 
the RWAs calculated under the CRSA. In 
this context, it is particularly worth noting 
that the defi  nitions of specifi  c and general 
credit risk adjustments are partly decoupled 
from the common accounting terminology. 
That is to say, accounting loss allowances 
are mapped to general or specifi  c credit risk

adjustments in accordance with criteria de-
termined by regulators. Individual, general 
and collective loss allowances are thus gen-
erally considered specifi  c credit risk adjust-
ments under EU law. Only provisioning 
amounts that are freely and fully available, 
as regards to timing and amount, to meet 
credit risk losses that have not yet material-
ised may be considered general credit risk 
adjustments. Under the German generally 
accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the 
freely available part of the reserve for gen-
eral banking risks pursuant to Section 340 f. 
of the Commercial Code (Handelsgesetz-
buch) is one example of a general credit risk 
adjustment. However, credit institutions 
often decide to not have their undisclosed 
reserves counted as Tier 2 items, since this 
would effectively require disclosure of these 
reserves in their Pillar 3 reports.
Under the IRB approaches, meanwhile, the 
entire stock of accounting loss allowances 
for credit risk – that is, specifi  c and general 
credit risk adjustments alike – is deemed eli-
gible for the comparison with the regula-
tory EL amount. As mentioned above, regu-
latory EL represents the fl  oor for backing 
credit risk with own funds. This is why a 
credit institution whose eligible provisions are lower than its regulatory EL is required  
to deduct the resulting shortfall directly 
from its Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) cap-
ital. If the opposite is the case – that is, the 
comparison of eligible provisions with the 
regulatory EL amount reveals an excess of 
provisions, regardless of whether they are 
considered specifi  c or general credit risk ad-
justments – an institution is permitted to in-
clude the excess amount in its Tier 2 capital 
up to a limit of 0.6% of the RWAs calcu-
lated under the respective IRB approach.
The evolution of the aggregate shortfall 
under IFRS 9 has been analysed for a sam-
ple of ten credit institutions that prepare 
their fi  nancial statements according to 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) and that reported a shortfall at least 
once between September 2017 and Sep-
tember 2018. The aggregate shortfall de-
clined noticeably over this horizon, falling 
from €2.1 billion at the end of September 
2017 to €805 million at the end of Septem-
ber 2018. Evidently, then, the difference be-
tween eligible provisions and the regulatory 
EL amount has decreased signifi  cantly in 
size. The observed increase in loss allow-
ances following the initial application of 
IFRS 9 suggested that such a decline would 
occur. The shortfall that still remains can be 
put down to the unique design and tech-
nical features of the approaches used to 
deter mine this measure.Shortfall * at German IFRS credit

ing of similar lending exposures and the valid -
ation of impairment models.
The scope of the Basel guidance primarily 
covers internationally active credit institutions 
for which the use of ECL models is mandatory 
on account of the accounting framework that 
applies to them. Consequently, these supervis -
ory expectations are, in principle, relevant to 
preparers of IFRS and US GAAP accounts 
alike.18 The guidance does, however, also con -
tain an appendix with supervisory expectations 
specific to credit institutions reporting under 
IFRSs. This appendix formulates more detailed 
supervisory expectations regarding the meas -
urement of 12- month ECL, the assessment of 
significant increases in credit risk, and the use 
of “practical expedients” under IFRS 9. In some 
cases, the Basel Committee interprets the 
IASB’s requirements in a conservative manner, 
thus signalling that credit institutions must 
meet the highest quality standards when im -
plementing IFRS 9 in order to satisfy supervisory 
expectations.
In May 2017, the EBA incorporated the Basel 
Committee’s guidelines into guidelines of its 
own19 and called on Member States to imple -
ment them in their national law via the “com -
ply or explain” mechanism. The ECB has de -
clared its intention to comply with the EBA 
guidelines for its jurisdiction – SIs in the euro 
area. For its part, the Federal Financial Supervis -
ory Authority (BaFin), in its capacity as Germa -
ny’s national competent authority for LSIs, saw 
no need to specify the Minimum Requirements 
for Risk Management (MaRisk) in response to 
the EBA guidelines because the latter are largely 
geared towards IFRS standards, while the vast 
majority of LSIs in Germany prepare their finan -
cial statements according to national GAAP 
(HGB).Impact of IFRS 9 on the 
prudential  capital require -
ments for credit risk
Two regulatory approaches are permitted for 
calculating the prudential capital requirements 
for credit risk – the standardised approach for 
credit risk (CRSA) and the internal ratings- based 
(IRB) approach. With IFRS 9 coming into force 
from 2018 and the US GAAP “current expected 
credit losses” (CECL) standard becoming applic -
able as of 2020, the Basel Committee investi -
gated how the new ECL accounting frame -
works interact with the relevant rules under the 
CRSA and IRB approach, and published its pre -
liminary deliberations for consultation at the 
end of 2016.20 The standard “Regulatory treat -
ment of accounting provisions – interim ap -
proach and transitional arrangements”21 was 
then published in March 2017, communicating 
two decisions of the Committee.
The first of these decisions is that the existing 
regulatory treatment of loss allowances will 
be  retained at least until the interaction be -
tween the capital requirements and the ECL 
account ing frameworks has been subjected to 
a thorough conceptual and quantitative analy -
sis. Under this “interim solution”, juris dictions 
would extend their existing approaches to cat -
egorising loss allowances as specific or general 
credit risk adjustments, which is of particular 
relevance for the CRSA, to loss allowances for … also includes

18 The new “current expected credit loss” impairment 
standard under US GAAP , applicable from 2020, also re -
quires the recognition of expected credit losses. However, 
unlike IFRS 9, loss allowances will be based solely on life -
time ECL.

IFRS 9 transitional arrangements in the 
European Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR)
Based on high- level requirements set out by 
the Basel Committee, Regulation (EU) 2017/ 
2395 effective as of 27  December 2017 
amended the European Capital Requirements 
Regulation (CRR) as regards transitional ar-
rangements for International Financial Report-
ing Standard (IFRS) 9. This transitional rule can 
be found in Article 473a of the CRR. Institu-
tions that prepare their accounts in conform-
ity with IFRSs, institutions that apply IFRSs vol-
untarily for supervisory reporting purposes 
pursuant to Article 24(2) of the CRR, and insti-
tutions that apply national generally accepted 
accounting principles (GAAP) which require 
the recognition of loss allowances on the 
basis of expected credit losses (ECL) all fall 
within the scope of these transitional arrange-
ments.
Application of the transitional arrangements is 
optional. Institutions were given until 1 Febru-
ary 2018 to notify their competent authority 
whether they wish to apply the arrangements. 
Where an institution has received the prior 
permission of the competent authority, it may 
reverse once, during the transitional period, 
its initial decision.
Specifi  cally, institutions are permitted, over a 
fi  ve- year transitional period starting in 2018, 
to add back to their Common Equity Tier 1 
(CET1) capital a portion of the additional loss 
allowances (provisions) incurred due to appli-
cation of ECL accounting.
This capital add- back needs to be calculated 
separately for portfolios under the standard-
ised approach for credit risk (CRSA) and the 
internal ratings- based (IRB) approach in order 
to ensure that only provisions in excess of 
the regulatory expected loss (EL) are included 
in own funds. Furthermore, the add- back 
amount is made up of a static and a dynamic 
component, with institutions having the op-
tion to deselect the latter. The idea behind the 
static component is to mitigate the increase in 
loss allowances resulting from day one appli-
cation of IFRS 9 at the effective date of transi-
tion from International Accounting Standard (IAS) 39 to IFRS 9. The dynamic component 
serves to dampen the potential subsequent 
impact in future periods, but it is confi  ned to 
loss allowances for non- defaulted exposures.
The phase- in factors applied to the provision-
ing amounts which can be added back will 
decrease over time – 95% in 2018, 85% in 
2019, 70% in 2020, 50% in 2021, and 25% in 
2022. It should be noted that institutions are 
permitted to almost fully neutralise the impact 
of transitioning to the new impairment re-
gime during the fi  rst transition period. This 
compromise was reached in the European 
nego tiations on the design of the transitional 
arrangements as a step towards creating a 
level playing fi  eld for IFRS and US GAAP insti-
tutions.
To prevent institutions from benefi  ting twice 
from the provisioning adjustments, these shall 
be effected in a consistent manner under the 
regulatory regime, which –  besides adjust-
ments to CET1 capital  – also necessitates 
changes to other regulatory items that are im-
pacted directly or indirectly by the “adjusted” 
provisions. This calls for a number of adjust-
ments, in particular to the capital deductions 
for deferred tax assets, the (CRSA) exposure 
values and the provisions included in Tier 2 
capital.
Whether an institution decides to apply the 
transitional arrangements or not, in the inter-
ests of market transparency it must communi-
cate its decision in the regulatory Pillar III re-
port. Institutions that decide to apply the 
IFRS 9 transitional arrangements are further-
more required to calculate and disclose all 
capital ratios and the leverage ratio both with 
and without the application of Article 473a of 
the CRR.
Currently, the German credit institutions are 
not making use of the transitional arrange-
ments, but a survey by the European Banking 
Authority (EBA) has found that 56% of EU in-
stitutions are doing so.Deutsche Bundesbank

ECL. As a result, and based on EU rules as they 
currently stand, the EBA published an Opinion 
which clarifies that all three stages of the IFRS 9 
impairment model constitute specific credit risk 
adjustments.22 Credit institutions that prepare 
their financial statements in conformity with 
IFRSs are now expected to comply with this 
stipulation. That said, the treatment of fair 
value adjustments has not yet been fully clari -
fied.
The second decision sets out a framework for 
transitional arrangements. Under this frame -
work, it is permissible (as an option) to phase in 
the impact of the new ECL accounting rules on 
CET1 capital as long as the transitional period 
does not exceed five years and certain other 
requirements are respected. To date, only the 
EU has made use of this option, though the 
supervisory authorities in the United States are 
also currently discussing the introduction of a 
regulatory transitional period for the US CECL 
standard.
Given the uncertainties associated with the 
(first- time) implementation of the new and far 
more complex impairment models, the afore -
mentioned transitional arrangements were set 
up as a kind of regulatory hedge against the 
possibility of a sudden and significant reduction 
of CET1 capital as a result of switching from 
incurred loss provisioning to ECL provisioning. 
During the transitional phase, supervisors can 
gain experience with the new accounting re -
quirements and how they are implemented by 
the institutions – experience which will ultim -
ately be needed to make a well- informed deci -
sion on whether the existing rules on the regu -
latory treatment of accounting loss allowances 
are appropriate.
Possible effects on business 
models and the stability of 
credit institutions
One topic raised while the accounting rules 
were being revised concerned the extent to which the ECL model under IFRS 9 might im -
pact on loan maturities. The European Systemic 
Risk Board (ESRB) addressed this issue in its 
“Finan cial stability implications of IFRS 9” re -
port.23 In this paper, the ESRB describes the 
possibility that institutions might shorten the 
maturities of their loans because the shorter 
the loan maturity, the lower the lifetime ECL 
they would need to recognise as a loss allow -
ance in the event of a significant increase in 
credit risk. Note that this incentive will probably 
be weaker as long as financial instruments are 
assigned to stage 1 on account of the shorter, 
12- month ECL observation period.
One of the most controversial issues at the mo -
ment is the potential procyclicality of ECL im -
pairment models.24 The new stages 1 and 2 
under IFRS 9 encourage credit institutions to 
recognise loss allowances at an early stage. 
This expedites the processing of relevant infor -
mation on credit quality as well as on the asso -
ciated expected credit losses, and this is gener -
ally to be welcomed. However, the ESRB writes 
in its “Financial stability implications of IFRS  9” 
report that this could cause procyclicality, espe -
cially if exposures are systematically shifted 
from stage 1 to stage 2. In the ESRB’s view, 
these shifts to stage 2 could occur on a major 
scale at a large number of institutions simultan -
eously if economic conditions deteriorated, 
pushing up borrower default rates. This could 
significantly increase the need for additional 
loss allowances and also put a strain on capital, 
potentially triggering a credit crunch and 
thereby exacerbating the economic downturn.A regulatory

One point that speaks against potential procy -
clicality is that, at the lowest point of a reces -
sion, IFRS 9 could lead to the early reversal of 
loss allowances if expectations regarding 
macroeconomic conditions and the individual 
borrower’s credit risk have improved. What 
counts here is that such expectations are not 
overly optimistic. In this case, the onus might 
be on banking supervisors to impose supervis -
ory measures in the form of capital add- ons, 
for instance.
Conclusion and outlook
IFRS 9 ranks as the most significant conceptual 
change in how financial instruments are ac -
counted for since it became mandatory for 
publicly traded entities to prepare their finan -
cial statements in conformity with IFRSs. Rec -
ognition of expected credit losses in the new 
impairment model puts into practice one of the 
G20’s main demands for a wider range of in -
formation to be incorporated into accounting. At this stage, it is not possible to make a clear 
statement on the long- term material impact 
of  the new standard going forward. In the 
short term, the biggest challenge for banks and 
supervisors will continue to be that of ensuring 
the proper implementation of the revised 
framework, which will entail considerable 
changes in institutions’ accounting processes 
and systems. Looking towards the medium and 
long term, the impact of IFRS 9 will need to be 
evaluated using quantitative data. It is for this 
reason that supervisors have stated that they 
are in favour of retaining the regulatory treat -
ment of accounting loss allowances for the 
time being.
There is no immediate need for action with 
regard   to accounting pursuant to the HGB, as 
this set of rules already implicitly contains the 
option of taking into account forward- looking 
components in the form of the prudence prin -
ciple as well as the concept of setting aside 
general loss allowances.Deutsche Bundesbank
