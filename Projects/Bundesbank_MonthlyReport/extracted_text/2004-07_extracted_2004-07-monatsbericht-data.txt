5CommentariesEconomic conditions
IndustryThe economic upturn in industry continued in
May with a renewed sharp increase in ordersreceived and output. Export orders, inparticular, showed a further rise – after theelimination of seasonal variations andchanges in the number of working days – andwere well above the already high level of theprevious month. This was in part attributableto a number of major orders. Compared withthe average level of the first quarter of 2004,there was a price-adjusted increase of some-what over 5% for the period of April andMay. Foreign orders were up 14
1/C254% on the
year. Many sectors reaped the benefits of thebuoyant demand, with producers of electricalmachinery and apparatus as well ascar manufacturers reporting a seasonally-adjusted one-tenth increase in orders.
In seasonally adjusted terms, the intake of do-
mestic orders in May was no higher than be-fore. Taking April and May together, however,the figure was up about
3/C254% on the first
quarter and 5% on the low level of the previ-ous year. While the consumer goods andintermediate goods industries did show somegrowth in comparison to the first quarter,capital goods producers, including car manu-facturers, recorded a slight decline in ordersreceived.
The overall increase in the flow of orders con-
tributed to a further sharp expansion in in-dustrial output in May. At a seasonally adjust-ed +1
1/C254%, the increase was only slightly lessOrders received

6than that in the previous month. The com-
bined figures for April and May exceeded thefirst-quarter level by 1
3/C254%. Output went up
by 41/C254% year on year compared with a figure
of 13/C254% in the first three months of the year.
Output growth was bolstered, in particular,by capital goods producers, with the manu-facturers of machinery and equipment and ofroad vehicles putting in the best perform-ance. By contrast, intermediate goods andconsumer goods producers recorded onlyslight increases in growth.
ConstructionDevelopments in the construction industry
continued to be unfavourable in the earlyspring. Although the seasonally adjusted vol-ume of orders received did increase some-what month on month in April, it fell wellshort of the first-quarter level. This meansthat the negative underlying trend, which hasbeen evident for several years, continuedthroughout the period under review. This ap-plies to both industrial and public sector con-struction. As regards residential construction,the rise in orders linked to the cutback inassistance at the end of last year has nowreceded again.
In line with demand, construction work con-
tinued its sluggish trend throughout April andMay, falling by almost one-tenth again yearon year according to current data. Evenassuming that the figures will be revisedupwards in the annual overall survey, this isstill a substantial decline.Economic conditions in Germany*

7Trade and services
The temporary improvement in the situation
in trade did not continue into the periodunder review. This is equally true of theproduction-related wholesale trade and theretail trade which is being affected by house-holds’ low propensity to purchase. Consistentwith the unfavourable sales trend, Ifo Insti-tute surveys also report a rather gloomy as-sessment of the current situation as well ascautious expectations. As regards service pro-viders, things appear to be picking up in thecommercial IT sectors, whereas other sectorsare suffering from the lack of positive stimuliemanating from external trade.
Overall outputDevelopments in the different sectors of the
economy therefore continued to vary widelyduring the second quarter. On the one hand,persistently buoyant export demand andsturdy industrial output are an indication thatin spring, too, strong growth impulses camefrom foreign trade. On the other hand, theincrease in domestic demand was still nomore than moderate. In terms of investment,the slight improvement in the machinery andequipment sector contrasted with the persist-ently unfavourable situation in the construc-tion sector. Households continued to be re-strained in their retail purchases. Driven bystrong exports, gross domestic product – afteradjustment for seasonal, working-day andprice effects – is likely to have increased con-siderably in the second quarter, however.There is some evidence that the growth ratewas even somewhat higher than in the first
three months of the year.
Labour marketUntil now, the economic recovery of the past
few months has brought no marked improve-ment on the labour market, with employ-ment falling up to the end of the periodunder review. In April, the number of personsin work, according to an initial estimate bythe Federal Statistical Office, was a seasonallyadjusted 38.09 million. This represents afurther decline of almost 30,000 on themonth and approximately 170,000, or 0.4%,year on year.
The seasonally adjusted number of persons
officially registered as unemployed totalled4.37 million in June, which was the same asin May but almost 100,000 more than at thebeginning of this year. Excluding participantsin aptitude-testing and training measures,this represents a year-on-year increase ofroughly 62,000. The seasonally adjusted un-employment rate, as defined by the FederalLabour Office, remained at 10.5%. Using thestandardised method, the figure was 9.8%.
Policy measures, especially the granting of
bridging allowances and business start-uploans, especially to self-employed persons,has eased unemployment. There has alsobeen a slight expansion in job creationschemes. On the other hand, there have beenfurther small cutbacks in vocational trainingand back-to-work grants.

8Prices
June saw a slowdown in the rise in consumer
prices, with the general price level fallingslightly in seasonally adjusted terms. Theyear-on-year rate of increase, which, at 2.0%in May, reached its highest level since the be-ginning of 2002, went down to 1.7%. Themain reason for this was that refined oil prod-ucts became somewhat cheaper again fol-lowing a perceptible rise. There was no rise inthe prices of industrial goods either. Theproduct categories of clothing and householdappliances even showed slight price reduc-tions. Furthermore, movements in the priceof food remained within narrow bounds.There was a further increase in the prices ofservices, however, and housing rents havebeen rising moderately again.
The decline in prices of refined oil products
was linked to a temporary decline in inter-national oil prices. In the past few days, how-ever, burgeoning fears about the supply of oilhave once again driven up prices on the spotmarkets. The price of a barrel of Brent NorthSea Oil, which at the end of June had gonedown to US$33.5, went up again to aroundUS$37. Europe was not too hard hit by thisrise as the euro appreciated somewhatagainst the US dollar.
Energy prices were also one of the main rea-
sons for the accelerated increase in industrialproducer prices. The year-on-year rate of in-crease rose to 1.6% in May after only 0.2%in the first quarter of 2004. There were alsoperceptible increases in the prices of steel andsteel products, for which there is strongworldwide demand. Higher material costs
were also the reason for an upward move-ment in construction prices for the first timein three years.
Public finances
Indebtedness of central, state and local
government
In May, new borrowing by central, state and
local government totalled 35.9 billion. The
accelerated rise vis-/C224-vis April was mainly dueto developments in central government,which raised 35.5 billion net. This has to be
seen, however, against the background of a33.3 billion increase in money market de-
posits. Outstanding money market loanswere reduced by 31.3 billion. On the capital
market, by contrast, central government bor-rowed 36.8 billion net. After deducting re-
demptions of matured securities, the volumeof Federal bonds (Bunds) outstanding rose by32.8 billion as a result of a new issue while
the current volume of five-year Federal notes(Bobls) increased by the same amount as a re-sult of a top-up. The amount of Treasury dis-count paper (Bubills) in circulation similarlygrew by 31.1 billion as, in addition to the
monthly issue and the redemption of oneissue, another 32 billion was raised through
market management operations. In this way,the volume of Federal Treasury notes(Sch/C228tze) outstanding also increased by 30.4
billion. Federal savings notes, by contrast,were again redeemed on balance (- 30.2 bil-
lion).

9The indebtedness of state government re-
mained virtually unchanged in May while de-velopments varied among the individualstates. Cash advances were reduced by atotal of 31.7 billion. By contrast, liabilities in
the form of loans against borrowers’ notesrose by 30.9 billion. Net revenue of 30.8 bil-
lion accrued to state government through theissue of Treasury notes. The gross volume ofthese notes issued amounted to 31.9 billion.
31 billion of this amount was accounted for
by the state of Berlin alone, whose issues in-cluded a four-year floating-rate note worth30.4 billion. The liabilities of the special funds
persisted at the previous month’s level. Bycontrast, local government indebtedness ap-pears to have marginally increased again.
Central government borrowingIn June, a month of major tax payments, cen-
tral government reduced its indebtedness by30.6 billion. While its money market debt in-
creased by 33.2 billion, its capital market li-
abilities declined by 33.8 billion. At 314.2 bil-
lion, gross borrowing was, however, relativelyhigh. This was primarily due to the issue of anew two-year Federal Treasury note with anallotment volume of 38.5 billion. Compared
with the issue which was last topped up inApril, the coupon was increased by
3/C254per-
centage point to 2.75%. A comparison withthe note issue that matured in June, however,still shows a significant decrease of 1.25 per-centage point in interest costs. After offset-ting the high redemptions and the marketmanagement operations, the outstandingamount of Sch/C228tze fell by 33.8 billion. The
second largest issue in June was the monthlytender of six-month Bubills in which 35.3 bil-
lion was allotted. The yield on these securitieswas almost 0.1 percentage point up on theMay issue at just over 2.1%. Together, the35.9 billion repayment volume and the repur-
chase of Bubills led to a decline of 31 billion
in their outstanding volume. By contrast, 31
billion was raised from Bunds through marketmanagement operations.
In the first half of 2004, the indebtedness of
central government rose very sharply by a cu-mulative total of 335.9 billion. Although the
irregular pattern of borrowing over the yearmeans that this rate of increase cannot be ex-pected to continue until December, it does,however, show that the amount of 329.3 bil-
lion envisaged in the 2004 budget (followingactual borrowing of 338.6 billion in 2003) willNet borrowing in the market

10be considerably overshot. Thus, central gov-
ernment’s issuance calendar for the thirdquarter of 2004 has already been expandedvis-/C224-vis the original annual plan by an add-itional reissue of a thirty-year Bund to the vol-ume of 35 billion. A supplementary budget is
expected in the autumn which should envis-age a noticeable increase in authorised bor-rowing.
The new borrowing by central government in
the first half of the year was primarily attrib-utable to Bund issues, which increased by317.2 billion on balance. Nevertheless, the
share of Bunds in the overall indebtedness ofcentral government declined. By contrast, therelative weight of Bobls increased somewhatas their volume grew by 39.3 billion in total.
The outstanding volume of Sch/C228tze increasedby34.6 billion. At 30.5 billion, the amount of
Bubills in circulation increased only slightly. Bycontrast, the downward trend in Federal sav-ings notes persisted (- 32.2 billion).
Securities markets
Bond marketIssuing activity in the German equity market
picked up slightly in May. At 397.7 billion, the
market value of debt securities issued by do-mestic borrowers was higher than in April(394.8 billion). After deducting redemptions
and changes in issuers’ holdings of their ownbonds, net sales increased very slightly to321.9 billion. Sales of foreign bonds and
notes in Germany raised 37.3 billion net.
In May two-thirds of the funds raised accrued
to credit institutions. At a market value of313.8 billion, refinancing in the bond market
by the credit institutions was down slightly onthe previous month ( 314.7 billion). The focus
was again on other bank bonds ( 37.9 billion)
and bonds issued by special purpose credit in-stitutions ( 33.0 billion). In contrast to the pre-
vious month, 31.9 billion net worth of public
Pfandbriefe and 30.9 billion net of mortgage
Pfandbriefe were sold.
The public sector more than doubled its new
borrowing in the bond market from 33.8 bil-
lion in the previous month to 37.9 billion. Of
these funds, 311.1 billion accrued to the Fed-
eral Government, which primarily issued ten-year Bunds amounting to 38.3 billion and

Federal savings notes outstanding decreasedby30.2 billion.

In May enterprises raised 31.6 billion in the
domestic capital market by selling longer-term corporate bonds. By contrast, the vol-ume of commercial paper outstanding fell by31.3 billion with the result that domestic
non-financial enterprises raised in all 30.3 bil-
lion in the bond market.
In May the main buyers in the bond market
were domestic investors. The credit institu-tions increased their bond holdings by 318.5
billion (April: 311.1 billion). Foreign bonds
and notes accounted for over one-third ofthis amount ( 36.7 billion). Non-banks added
34.5 billion to their bond portfolios in May. In
contrast to the previous month, they investedprimarily in debt securities issued by domesticborrowers.
Equity marketDespite the first two IPOs for nearly two
years, issuing activity in the German equitymarket, at a mere 30.3 billion, fell back in
May to the low level at the start of the yearafter new shares with a market value of 33.4
billion had been placed in April. However,33.0 billion of this figure was accounted for
by a major German bank’s capital increase. Bycontrast, after having declined by 33.8 billion
in April, the amount of foreign equities out-standing increased by 34.4 billion by the end
of the period under review. While domesticnon-banks purchased 311.9 billion worth of
German shares, credit institutions and non-residents reduced their equity holdings by35.7 billion and 35.9 billion respectively.

flows amounted to 31.6 billion. Bond-based
funds were particularly affected (- 31.0 billion)
as were mixed funds (- 30.8 billion), the latter
having recorded inflows of 31.7 billion in
April. Share-based funds lost 30.3 billion,
while money market funds placed 30.4 billion
worth of shares. The volume outstanding ofshares in mutual funds open to the generalpublic decreased by 30.7 billion. Resources
amounting to 30.5 billion flowed from bond-
based funds. Share-based funds and moneymarket funds recorded outflows of 30.3 bil-
lion and 30.1 billion respectively, at the same
level as in the previous month. However,mixed funds and open-end real estate fundseach sold 30.1 billion worth of shares. The
volume of foreign mutual fund shares out-standing rose by 30.4 billion.
Domestic non-banks returned 32.2 billion
worth of domestic mutual fund shares, afterhaving been on the purchasing side in theprevious month ( 31.2 billion). They purchased
only 30.2 billion of foreign paper, following
31.7 billion in the previous month. On bal-
ance, credit institutions added 30.1 billion to
their portfolios of both domestic and foreignmutual fund shares. Foreign investors divest-ed themselves of 30.1 billion worth of
domestic mutual fund shares.
Balance of payments
In May 2004 the German current account re-
corded a surplus of 38.8 billion, 31.0 billion
lower than the value of the previous month.The reason for this fall was a larger deficit oninvisible current transactions, which comprise
services, factor income and current transfers.The trade surplus was also somewhat lowerthan in the previous month.
According to provisional figures from the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, the trade surplus wentdown by 30.1 billlion to 314.2 billion in May.
In seasonally adjusted terms, however, thesurplus rose by 31 billion to 315
1/C252billion. This
was caused by a somewhat stronger increasein the exports of goods than in the imports ofgoods. Whereas exports went up by a sea-sonally adjusted 4% in May, imports in-creased by only 3
1/C252%. In a three-month com-
parison (March to May 2004 compared withDecember 2003 to February 2004), there wasan even sharper increase in exports (4
1/C252%).
The rise in imports amounted to 2%, but thiswas due mainly to price developments.
The deficit on invisible current transactions in-
creased in May by 30.5 billion on the month
to34.5 billion. The primary reason for the rise
was the increase in net expenditure on cross-border factor income. Consequently, therewas a deficit on factor income of 30.1 billion
in May compared with a surplus of 30.8 bil-
lion in the previous month. At the same time,net expenditure on current transfers rose by30.5 billion to 32.3 billion. By contrast, the
deficit on services fell by 30.9 billion to 32.2
billion.
There were again net exports of capital
through portfolio investment in May, namely310.9 billion compared with net outflows of
312.6 billion in April. German investors ac-

13for311.1 billion. Demand was primarily for
foreign bonds and notes ( 36.6 billion), espe-
cially euro-denominated debt securities, aswas the case in the previous month. Further-more, they invested 33.5 billion in foreign
shares. Foreign investors, on the other hand,adjusted their portfolios: they bought Germanbonds and notes ( 38.0 billion) – particularly
private bonds – and sold German shares ( 35.8
billion) and money market paper ( 31.8 billion).
Direct investment also resulted in outflows of
funds. However, at 32.5 billion net, these were
fairly small. On balance, foreign firms with-drew investment funds from Germany ( 32.1
billion). First, they sold participating interests inGermany and, second, German branches re-paid loans to their foreign parent companies.However, foreign investment by German en-terprises was almost unchanged (- 30.4 billion):
net inflows from intra-group credit flows pre-vented an increase in equity capital.
In May, there were net inflows through the
non-securitised credit transactions of non-banks ( 34.3 billion). Enterprises and individ-
uals accounted for 33.0 billion and general
government for 31.3 billion. At the same
time, funds flowed out of the domestic bank-ing system ( 38.5 billion). Whereas the net
capital exports of the monetary financial insti-tutions (excluding the Bundesbank) amount-ed to 317.9 billion, the Bundesbank recorded
inflows of funds totalling 39.4 billion, primar-
ily through reduced claims in the paymentsystem TARGET.
The Bundesbank’s foreign reserves – at trans-
action values – fell by 30.6 billion in May.Major items of the balance

15Financial development
and outlook of
the statutory health
insurance schemeThe health service in Germany repre-
sents an important – and fast-growing– part of the national economy. Therange of health benefits are largely fi-nanced via the statutory health insur-ance scheme by wage-related contri-butions from members. The financialdevelopment of the statutory healthinsurance scheme and the resultantchanges in the contribution rates havea significant impact on the overalleconomy.
Despite a considerable rise in the aver-
age contribution rate, the statutoryhealth insurance scheme has recordedsubstantial deficits in the past fewyears. This development prompted thelatest reform of the health service, theaim of which is to help lower the accu-mulated debt and noticeably reducethe contribution rates in the next fewyears. Nevertheless, in the longer termthis reform will be unable to prevent afurther increase in contribution rates,particularly in the light of demo-graphic changes and the cost-boostingeffects of advances in medical technol-ogy. In considering the additionalreforms which are consequentlyrequired, key requirements are to limitthe levy burden on labour, to separateincome redistribution aspects from theequivalence principle and to intensifycompetition.

16Current situation of the statutory
health insurance scheme
Between 2001 and 2003 the statutory health
insurance scheme recorded persistent deficitsamounting to between 33 billion and 33
1/C252
billion each year even though the average
contribution rate was concurrently raisedfrom 13.6% to 14.3%. Given the acute fi-nancial problems and the looming danger ofa further rise in contribution rates, legislativemeasures were taken immediately followingthe German parliamentary elections of 2002to improve the financial situation in the shortterm. During 2003 the government coalitionparties and the opposition parties CDU/CSUin the Bundestag then jointly adopted the Actmodernising the statutory health insurancescheme, which entered into force on 1 Janu-ary 2004. Besides measures aimed at improv-ing revenue, this notably included moves tolimit spending (including raising patient co-payments) but also the outsourcing of individ-ual health benefits. However, no attempt wasmade to radically reorganise competitionamong health insurance institutions andhealth service providers or to fundamentallyredesign the financing system.
With an expenditure volume in 2003 of 3145
billion or almost 7% of GDP , the statutoryhealth insurance scheme is the second largestcomponent of the German social security sys-tem after the statutory pension insurancescheme. The contribution rate currently aver-ages 14.2% compared with 19.5% for thestatutory pension insurance scheme, 6.5%for the Federal Employment Agency and1.7% for the long-term care insurance
scheme.
The statutory health insurance scheme (like
the long-term care insurance scheme) differsconsiderably from the other social securityschemes. The scheme, which provides a com-prehensive array of healthcare services andplays an important role in the overall econ-omy, is extensively regulated. Whereas theequivalence principle (ie the broad matchingof contributions with corresponding benefits)is of particular importance in the statutorypension and unemployment insuranceschemes, this is not the case for the statutoryhealth insurance scheme. Even though, as inthe other social security schemes, contribu-tions are proportionate to income up to thedefined contribution ceiling, all benefits apartfrom sickness benefit are non-income related.However, the associated interpersonal redis-tribution of income is curbed by the far lowercontribution ceiling compared with the otherschemes and the possibility for high-incomeearners to switch to private health insuranceinstitutions.
1Furthermore, the statutory
health insurance scheme is characterised by alarge number of individual health insuranceinstitutions
2with differing contribution rates
and largely identical benefits; the competition
1In 2004 the maximum level of income subject to contri-
butions to the statutory health and long-term care insur-
ance schemes is 33,487.50 per month (in both western
and eastern Germany). The contribution ceiling for the
statutory pension and unemployment insurance schemes
amounts to 35,150 in western Germany and 34,350 in
eastern Germany. The income threshold from which it is
possible to opt out of compulsory membership of the
statutory health and long-term care insurance schemes is
33,862.50.
2At the end of 2003 some 322 health insurance institu-
tions were registered. Owing to mergers, this figure is de-
clining.Persistent

17among institutions is primarily influenced by
risk structure compensation arrangementsdesigned to minimise the incentive to adopt arisk selection policy.
Each health insurance institution is obliged to
set its contribution rate for the year at a levelensuring that projected revenue will suffi-ciently cover anticipated expenditure and– where necessary – replenish its reserves.
3If
in the course of implementing the budget itbecomes clear that there will not be sufficientrevenue, the contribution rate has to beraised during the year. There is no provisionfor debt financing.
Healthcare services are also financed from
other sources besides the statutory health in-surance scheme. These include private healthinsurance institutions which have around 8.1million fully insured persons, compared with70.5 million in the statutory health insurancescheme. Furthermore, patient co-payments,healthcare subsidies for civil servants andexclusively private payments for healthcareservices play a non-negligible role.
The healthcare system in Germany is of con-
siderable macroeconomic importance. In2002 there were just under 4.2 million peopleworking in the healthcare sector; this corres-ponds to a share in total employment of10.6%.
4Almost 11% of German GDP was
spent on healthcare services (including long-term care insurance) in 2002. In an inter-national ranking healthcare spending washigher only in the United States (14
1/C252%) and
Switzerland (just over 11%) (see adjacentchart). Taking only government spending onhealthcare and long-term care, the expend-
iture ratio in Germany – at 8
1/C252% – is the
highest, followed by Sweden (just under 8%)and France (7

19Underlying pattern of financial
development since 1995
Since the mid-1990s the finances of the
statutory health insurance scheme have beensubject to considerable fluctuations (see adja-cent chart).
5Following deficits of around
331/C252billion in 1995 and 1996, there were
small surpluses in the four years that fol-lowed. Since 2001, however, there have beenfurther deficits amounting to between 33 bil-
lion and 33
1/C252billion. Since, following the def-
icits in the mid-1990s, the reserves barely ful-filled the statutory minimum requirement ofone-quarter of a month’s expenditure, thenew financial shortfalls could frequently onlybe bridged through borrowing; this resultedin (net) indebtedness of 36 billion at the end
of 2003.
6
Between 1996 and 1998, health insurance in-stitutions in eastern Germany had alreadystarted to resort to borrowing, which was notprovided for by law. The Act Reinforcing theFinancial Basis of the Statutory Health Insur-ance Scheme of 1998 then extended the riskstructure compensation scheme to the wholeof Germany – initially only for the period from1999 to 2001. With the Act Reinforcing Soli-darity in the Statutory Health InsuranceScheme, which entered into force at the be-ginning of 1999, the pan-German compensa-tion scheme was continued indefinitely. Theresultant transfers from western to easternGermany were designed to enable the eastGerman health insurance institutions to re-duce their debt again (for more details on thisand the risk structure compensation schemein general, see the box on page 20).The overall negative financial development
since the mid-1990s is primarily attributableto the sluggish growth of income subject tocompulsory contributions (basic wages).Since 1995 this has grown by only 1.1% peryear. Its share in GDP consequently fell from48.7% to 44.8%. Only an increase in thecontribution rates from 13.2% to 14.4% inwestern Germany and from 12.8% to 14.1%in eastern Germany enabled the ratio of rev-enue to GDP to be maintained at around6.7%.As % of GDP

20The risk structure compensation scheme of the statutory health insurance scheme
One of the aims of the Act regulating the structure of
the health insurance system of 1992 was to foster keen-er competition among the health insurance institu-tions. Thus from 1996 the right to freely choose one’shealth insurance institution was extended to all mem-bers. Despite the fact that health insurance institutionsare compelled to accept everyone who applies to join,a selection into good and bad risks was feared. In orderto avoid this, a risk structure compensation schemewas introduced in 1994; this comprises the componentsincome subject to compulsory contributions paid bymembers, age, gender and invalidity.
Until 1998 the risk structure compensation scheme was
split into two separate accounts: East and West. TheAct Reinforcing the Financial Basis of the StatutoryHealth Insurance Scheme of 1998 extended the finan-cial compensation scheme to the whole of Germany.This was originally limited to the end of 2001 and pri-marily served to eliminate the accumulated debt of theeast German institutions. Moreover, this solely involvedcompensating “financial strength” but not the “contri-bution requirement” between eastern and westernGermany.
The contribution requirement of a health insurance in-
stitution is calculated as the sum of “standardised ex-penditure on benefits” per insured person. The stand-ardised expenditure on benefits for each insured per-son varies depending on age, gender, sickness benefitentitlements and, where appropriate, receipt of a dis-ability pension. The contribution requirement of insti-tution i (BB
i) is calculated as the sum of standardised
expenditure on benefits per risk category j (sLA j) multi-
plied by the institution-specific absolute frequency(n
i
j).
BBi¼P
jsLA j/C1ni

The financial strength of an institution is measured by
multiplying the compensation requirement rate ( Aus-
gleichsbedarfssatz (ABS)), formed as a “standardised
contribution rate” as a quotient of the aggregatedcontribution requirement of all institutions and thetotal income subject to compulsory contributions of allmembers of the statutory health insurance scheme, bythe total income subject to compulsory contributionsof the relevant institution (bpE
i).

The risk structure compensation scheme establishes a
balance between the institution’s contribution require-ment and financial strength. Whether an institution isa net payer or a net receiver depends on whether its fi-nancial strength is larger or smaller than its contribu-tion requirement.The Act Reinforcing the Financial Basis of the Statutory
Health Insurance Scheme merely envisaged a uniformcompensation requirement rate for the whole of Ger-many and not a harmonisation of the standardised ex-penditure on benefits. Although absolute per capitaexpenditure in eastern Germany is below the west Ger-man level, the ratio of expenditure to income subjectto compulsory contributions is less favourable in east-ern Germany; for this reason the compensation re-quirement rate for the whole of Germany is lower thanthe figure for eastern Germany alone but higher thanthe value for western Germany. Consequently, westernGermany is allocated higher and eastern Germanylower financial strength. The financial strength of theeast German institutions calculated in this way is there-fore effectively below their contribution requirementcalculated in isolation. The financial strength compen-sation offsets the differences in the average sum of in-come subject to compulsory contributions between theeast and west German states.
The Act Reinforcing Solidarity in the Statutory Health
Insurance Scheme of 1998 saw the 2001 limit lifted andthe Act creating legal equality in the statutory healthinsurance scheme of 1999 provided for the gradualtransition to a pan-German risk structure compensa-tion scheme by 2007. This also introduced the offset-ting of contribution requirements between easternand western Germany. The pan-German standardisedexpenditure on benefits is likely to be lower than inwestern Germany and higher than in eastern Germany.Therefore, the contribution requirement will be raisedin eastern Germany and lowered in western Germany;this will result in additional transfers from western toeastern Germany.
The gradual transition to a complete risk compensation
structure for Germany as a whole will result in a har-monisation of the “standardised contribution rates”.Since, however, not all expenditure categories (for ex-ample administrative costs, state-financed spa treat-ments) are included in the compensation scheme, insti-tutions retain full freedom of competition in theseareas. The risk structure compensation scheme leads toan (intended) disinterest of institutions in good or badrisks when selecting their insured persons. There is,however, still an incentive to deal with the risks arisingas cost-effectively as possible.
The Act Reforming the Risk Structure Compensation
Scheme of 2001 extended the risk structure compensa-tion scheme by creating a risk pool. If the annual ex-penditure of an insured person on certain benefits ex-ceeds a defined threshold, the 60% of the excessamount is borne by all institutions. In addition, institu-tions receive a grant if they set up disease manage-ment programmes for certain chronic illnesses. Further-more, from 2007 onwards the morbidity rate of a com-munity of insured persons will no longer be deter-mined indirectly by proxies such as gender or age, butinstead will be determined directly using statistical re-cording of morbidity differences.

21The weak revenue trend was the outcome,
firstly, of the relatively small rise in overallgross wages and salaries. This was com-pounded, however, by the fact that the rev-enue of members subject to compulsory con-tributions grew 0.4 percentage point moreslowly on average than overall gross wagesand salaries (see adjacent chart). This wascaused in part by the high-earning membersswitching to private health insurance institu-tions.
7Other contributory factors were the
cuts in health insurance contributions for re-cipients of unemployment assistance as wellas the option introduced in 2002 permittingemployees to contribute to company pensionschemes with direct payments which are notsubject to social security contributions.
With an annual average increase of 2.0%, ex-
penditure has not risen more steeply thannominal GDP since 1995; this means that theratio has remained virtually unchanged at6.8%. However, this pattern fluctuated in in-dividual years, with legislative changes play-ing a significant role (see the box on pages 24and 25). Whereas expenditure on healthcareservices grew by 1.9%, administrative costs(which accounted for 5.7% of total spendingin 2003) went up by 3.7% on an annual aver-age.
Among the main expenditure categories,
spending on pharmaceuticals has shown thesteepest rise by far since the mid-1990s (by5.0% per annum), even though a string ofshort-term cost-cutting measures were takento offset this (higher co-payments by patients,additional discounts from manufacturers,wholesalers and pharmacists, expansion ofthe list of pharmaceuticals that are subject to
price regulation, direct payments from thepharmaceutical industry). The sharp growthwas partly due to the increasing number ofprescriptions for more expensive medicines,which, owing to their patent protection, arenot subject to price regulation. Expenditureon therapeutic treatment and aids – albeitless significant – also recorded an above-average increase of 3.4% per year.
The other major expenditure items grew con-
siderably more slowly. Spending on out-patient treatment, for example, rose by 1.9%per year. Although, with a view to stabilising1995 = 100, log scale

22contribution rates, budgeting in this area is
fundamentally geared to the growth of basicwages, this expenditure item increased fasterover the entire period. Spending on hospitalin-patient treatment went up by 1.7% peryear. Besides budget measures, these costswere held down primarily by a significant re-duction in the duration of hospital stays. Des-pite an overall rise in the number of cases,the total number of days spent in hospital de-clined. Expenditure on dental treatment (in-cluding dentures) has developed very moder-ately since 1995, increasing by an annualaverage of 1.1% between 1995 and 2003.Unlike the other expenditure categories,spending on sickness benefit actually declinedat an annual average rate of 3.7% between1995 and 2003. The main reason for this wasthe lowering of sickness benefit from 80% to70% of gross wages as from 1997 and also

Administrative costs of health insurance insti-tutions rose much more steeply (by 3.7% perannum) than expenditure on benefits. This ispartly due to the fact that fewer and feweremployers are willing to directly bear the ad-ministrative costs of their company health in-surance institution. But even if the adminis-trative costs per member of the companyhealth insurance institutions had not in-creased more sharply than at other institu-tions, administrative costs would still havegrown by an annual average of 2.7%, which1995

23is considerably faster than expenditure on
healthcare services. One of the probable rea-sons for this is that health insurance institu-tions which lost members to other institutionswere unable to adjust their administrativecapacity rapidly enough.
However, the varying trends in individual
health service categories makes it almost im-possible to draw any clear-cut conclusionsabout misdirected developments. For ex-ample, health services are in part substitutive.Thus if in-patient treatment is replaced byout-patient care, the respective expenditureshares are bound to change accordingly (fordetails of the expenditure structure see thechart on page 22).
Health service reform of 2004
With the introduction of the latest health ser-
vice reform (Act modernising the statutoryhealth insurance scheme), a renewed attempthas been made to counter the unfavourablefinancial development and the pressure of in-creasing contribution rates (for details of themeasures see the box on pages 24 and 25).The draft legislation envisaged financial reliefof almost 310 billion – or 1 percentage point
in contribution rates – for the public healthinsurance institutions for this year alone.With the additional outsourcing of dentureservices and the first increment in the newFederal grant, the volume of relief is set torise to just over 315 billion in 2005. In 2006
the Federal grant will be raised by a further31.7 billion. Moreover, starting in 2006 a spe-
cial contribution of 0.5% will be introducedfor members; this will bring about a redistri-
bution of the contribution burden betweenemployers and employees.
It was envisaged that the legislative measures
will enable the average contribution rate tobe lowered in 2004 from 14.3% to 13.6%.However, as things stand today, this figurewill nowhere near be reached. The deficit of33.4 billion in 2003 shows that even the con-
tribution rate of 14.3% was not sufficient tocover expenditure. In the absence of reformsa rate of more than 15
1/C252% would have been
required this year in order to completely elim-inate the accumulated debt and to top up thereserves to their statutory minimum. Al-though the expected relief from the Act mod-ernising the statutory health insurancescheme, together with the spreading of thedebt reduction over four years which wasalso stipulated in that law, will reduce thecontribution requirement by 1
1/C252%, an annual
average contribution rate of under 14%seems barely attainable in 2004. This doesnot, however, rule out the possibility that itmay be lowered to under 14% by the end ofthe year.
In the first quarter of 2004, the public health
insurance institutions achieved a surplus of31.1 billion,
9compared with a deficit of 30.6
billion in the same period of 2003. Overallrevenue went up by 1.5%. Revenue fromcontributions increased somewhat more

26sharply (by 2.0%); the main reason for this
was probably the extension of compulsorycontributions for company pensions. Expend-iture fell by 3.6% compared with the firstthree months of last year. Spending onpharmaceuticals, therapeutic treatment andaids, sickness benefit and travel expenses de-clined particularly sharply. Moreover, deathbenefit has been completely abolished asfrom this year. By contrast, higher expend-iture was recorded for out-patient treatment,dentures and hospital treatment.
These results already indicate that the health
service reform will achieve considerable relief.However, the improvement in the first quarterof 2004 was overstated by a surge in demandfor pharmaceuticals and therapeutic treat-ment and aids, in particular, at the end of2003 prior to the introduction of the newmeasures. On the other hand, during the re-mainder of 2004 additional Federal resourcesof31.0 billion will accrue to the health insur-
ance institutions. Overall, a surplus is expect-ed for 2004.
Challenges and reform options
The Act modernising the statutory health
insurance scheme initiated important stepstowards strengthening the individual respon-sibility of insured persons. The attempt to sta-bilise contribution rates relies not just onrationing services and fixing prices but alsonotably on attaching a greater weight to pa-tient co-payments so as to raise cost con-sciousness and thus encourage a more effi-cient utilisation of healthcare resourcesthrough a closer linkage of costs and bene-
fits. The pegging of contributions to labourincome has, however, been largely retained.Similarly, competition among health insur-ance institutions as well as among health ser-vice providers has been stepped up onlyslightly. Problems are also looming in connec-tion with the foreseeable demographicchanges.
Past health service reforms were aimed pri-
marily at limiting the rise in contributionrates. This aim clashes, however, with thegrowing demand for healthcare services, as anatural consequence of our affluent and alsoageing society, and with rising costs owing toadvances in medical technology. Cost-curbingmeasures – once available rationalisation re-serves have been exhausted – therefore implyreductions in the benefits provided by thepublic health insurance institutions. At themacroeconomic level this raises the question,above all, of how tasks assigned to the statu-tory health insurance scheme can be organ-ised and financed so as to avoid distortions ofallocation while maintaining desired redistri-bution aspects.
The high wage-related contributions and the
lack of equivalence between contributionsand benefits in the statutory health insurancescheme lead to considerable distortions onthe labour market. For example, incentivesfor taking up employment in areas subject tocompulsory insurance are dampened. At thesame time, employers’ willingness to offersuch employment declines – if the social se-curity burdens cannot be directly and fullypassed on to employees. If domestic labour

27becomes more expensive, this triggers substi-
tution effects in favour of the production fac-tor capital (in the form of rationalisation) orforeign labour (by shifting productionabroad). In addition, this leads to distortionson the domestic labour market in favour ofjobs which are not subject to compulsorysocial security contributions.
The health service reform of 2004 will place
the financing of the statutory health insur-ance scheme on a somewhat moreemployment-friendly footing. In future, forexample, insurance for dentures will be fi-nanced separately by non-income related pre-miums. The shift away from the current sys-tem of equal financing by employer and em-ployee by levying a special contribution fromemployees as from 2006 may likewise pro-mote employment if the reaction of the la-bour supply to the increase in employees’share of contributions is not as strong as thatof the labour demand to the decrease inemployers’ share – and as long as this shift inthe balance is not neutralised in the comingpay rounds. The tax-financed Federal grantwill also reduce the contribution burden.However, taxes have to be raised in otherareas in order to finance it. Specifically, to-bacco tax rates have been raised substantiallyfor this purpose, although this will not yieldthe originally expected additional revenue.
Further-going proposals for reorganising the
financing of the statutory health insurancescheme range from widening the incomebase subject to compulsory contributions, byincluding additional types of income and add-itional social groups, to switching to a systemof non-income related insurance premiums
coupled with financing the desired redistribu-tion components out of general tax revenue.
Raising the maximum level of income subject
to contributions from the current monthlyamount of 33,487.50 to, for example, the
same level as for the statutory pension insur-ance scheme ( 35,150) would yield additional
revenue of around 34 billion per year, thus
enabling the contribution rate to be loweredby 0.4 percentage point. However, this gen-eral relief would create noticeable additionalcosts of up to 3230 per month (including the
employer’s contribution) for higher-incomeearners. By contrast, the burden on lower-income earners would be eased. With regardto possible employment effects, it should beremembered that pensioners, who constitutea large social group but are not part of thelabour market, would also benefit.
The inclusion of other types of income in
compulsory contributions is targeted first andforemost at capital and rental income. In thiscase, too, there are income redistribution ef-fects. To the extent that the contribution basecan actually be widened, this would createpotential for lowering the contribution rate.However, this would simultaneously dampenincentives to make private pension provision,which is necessary in view of the demo-graphic development and which, moreover, isbeing subsidised by considerable publicfunds, for example in the “Riester pensionplan”. Furthermore, it would weaken the ef-forts that are being made in the context ofthe tax amnesty to repatriate capital that hasso far evaded the tax authorities. In addition,

28given the high mobility of capital, its addition-
al taxation is likely to enjoy only limited suc-cess. This would also necessitate considerableadministrative costs associated with the add-itional recording of this income in the statu-tory health insurance scheme.
Extending compulsory contributions to the
statutory health insurance scheme to personswho are currently privately insured
10would
not only widen the contribution base butwould also entail additional expenditure forthis group of persons. Leeway to lower thecontribution rate would arise only if this newgroup of members turned out to be net con-tributors to the statutory health insurancescheme. Owing to legal constraints, extend-ing compulsory contributions to this newgroup might be applicable only for those justbeginning their career, so that a noticeablelowering of contribution rates could be ex-pected at most only in the distant future.
The approaches to widening the contribution
base are subsumed under the umbrella term“citizens’ insurance model” ( B/C252rgerversiche-
rung ). However, diverse alternatives are con-
ceivable, which means that the term is by nomeans unambiguous. Calculations includingall currently private insured persons indicate apotential to cut contribution rates within theframework of a “citizens’ insurance model”(without raising the maximum level of incomesubject to contributions) of 1.3 percentagepoints in total.
11The inclusion of higher earn-
ing employees, self-employed persons andcivil servants would contribute 0.2 percent-age point per group. An extension to othertypes of income would allow a contributionrate cut of 0.8 percentage point. By contrast,
the additional costs that would be incurredby the inclusion of currently private insuredpensioners would require an increase in thecontribution rate of 0.1 percentage point.These effects have to be viewed in the con-text that this approach is not concerned withlowering the contribution burden but with re-distributing it. Appreciable employment gainscan hardly be expected from this – also giventhe fact that the task of easing the pension-ers’ burden would have to be financed bypersons in work.
The concept of a flat-rate “health premium”
represents a proposal to completely de-couple contributions to the statutory healthinsurance scheme from labour income. Underthis concept each insured person would haveto pay a flat-rate monthly premium regardlessof his/her individual income. The currentemployer’s contribution would be paid out toemployees as part of their pay. Most pro-posals advocating a health premium includenon-contributory co-insurance for children;on the other hand, both spouses would haveto pay the premium. A social compensationcomponent is envisaged so as to avoid over-burdening persons on lower incomes, for ex-ample by stipulating that the level of contri-butions to the statutory health insurancescheme does not exceed a certain percentageof their income. This social compensation

29component could largely be financed by tax-
ing the share of contributions currently borneby the employer, which would place a greaterburden on the higher income brackets.Nevertheless, additional financing resourceswould also be necessary. The social welfareand redistribution effects would then dependon the precise form of this financing. All inall, however, a regime of separate wage tax-ation – which is what the current system offinancing the statutory health insurancescheme amounts to – would be replaced by a“health insurance price” which is free of dis-tortions. The desired social compensationcomponent would be financed more appro-priately out of general tax revenue. Althoughthis would in turn give rise to new distortions,the associated redistribution effect would bemore transparent, could be more selectivelytargeted and would probably be more limit-ed, with the result that the distortions wouldbe smaller.
An expert opinion presented on 15 July 2004
contains proposals for a concrete changeoverto a health premium model and discusses thefinancing alternatives for the inter-personalsocial compensation.
12It assumes that the
scope of services will be concentrated on themandatory standard services and that sick-ness benefit insurance will be spun off. Giventhese assumptions, every adult person in-sured under the statutory health insurancescheme would be required to pay a healthpremium of 3169 per month as an average
across all health insurance institutions. Thiswould be accompanied by a tax-financedpayment per child of 378. This could be fi-
nanced by the additional tax revenue result-ing from the outpayment and taxation of the
employer’s contribution. The social compen-sation component envisages a contributionceiling of 12.5% of an insured person’s grossincome. Additional tax resources amountingto322.5 billion are necessary for financing
the premium grants. To achieve this, for ex-ample, the solidarity surcharge would have tobe increased by 11.9 percentage points (iemore than tripled) or the standard turnovertax rate would have to be raised by 2.5 per-centage points. The option of financing with-in the health insurance system would require,besides the flat-rate premium, an additionalincome-related contribution of 2.9% to thestatutory health insurance scheme. These re-form proposals highlight the massive volumeof income redistribution within the statutoryhealth insurance scheme. Financing this solelyout of tax resources would result in macro-economic problems.
In view of the demographic changes that are
occurring, a greater element of capital fund-ing is often proposed for the statutory healthinsurance scheme. In this way the privatehealth insurance institutions attempt to keeppremiums stable in spite of the age-inducedincrease in individual expenditure require-ments. In a pay-as-you-go social security sys-tem where the bulk of expenditure is on eld-erly people, a changeover to a funded systemwould, however, mean a double burden forthe transitional generation; not only mustthey build up their own reserves but they alsohave to finance a large part of expenditurefor those people who do not have sufficient

30reserves of their own. This additional burden
has to be compared with a possibly higheryield under a funded system.
13An argument
against a collective accumulation of reservesis that in the past reserves set up for particularpurposes were often liquidated prematurely.
A funded system of healthcare provision can
help to shift part of the additional financialburdens caused by demographic changesfrom the future to the present. However,such a funding system would not have to belocated within the statutory health insurancescheme. One conceivable option, for ex-ample, could be additional private old-ageprovision in the form of a funded pension in-surance scheme, which could be used tocover the higher insurance premiums of olderinsured persons in the future. In this way, thestatutory health insurance scheme, too,would be better prepared for the demo-graphic burdens.
Nevertheless, a fundamental reform of the
statutory health insurance scheme cannot belimited to restructuring the financing system(which is the focus of this article). Concen-trating efforts on the revenue side could re-duce the pressure to maximise the efficiencypotential. A reform on the revenue side mustnot lead to neglecting necessary measures onthe benefits side.
There is a broad consensus that efficiency re-
serves are available on the benefits sidewhich, once mobilised, could help dampenthe increase in expenditure – especially by in-tensifying competition both among health in-surance institutions and among health serviceproviders. This also includes allowing the in-
stitutions greater discretion in connectionwith additional competition parameters, forexample the extent of insurance protectionwhich is offered. A further extension of pa-tients’ co-payments would be a suitablemeans of raising the cost consciousness ofboth service providers and patients. Thepresent contractual relationship between in-stitutions and service providers could be liber-alised by, for example, granting institutionsthe right to conclude contracts with individ-ual doctors or groups of doctors. Other im-portant measures aimed at boosting competi-tion and curbing costs include a more exten-sive use of remuneration systems based ondiagnosis-related groups, greater provision ofout-patient treatment by hospitals and theliberalisation of trading in pharmaceuticals. Inaddition, the transparency of service provisioncould be enhanced for insured persons byswitching from the principle of receiving freebenefits to the principle of cost refunding.
Conclusions
The latest health service reform is likely to sta-
bilise the finances of the statutory health in-surance scheme for a limited time. However,they have not yet been placed on a sustain-able long-term footing. Under the status quo,the ageing of the population and the wel-come but costly advances in medical technol-ogy will soon increase the pressure to raise

Bycontrast, members of working age contributeone-and-a-half times as much as the averagecosts which they cause. A shift in the relativeratio of working to retired persons will there-fore require a higher contribution rate.
As is already the case with the current health
service reform, future reforms will need tofocus not just on exploiting available effi-ciency reserves – especially by fostering keen-er competition – but above all on decidingwhat services are to be provided by the statu-tory health insurance scheme and how theassociated financial burdens are to be shared.The insufficient scope under the current in-surance system to use the pricing mechanismto align healthcare supply more closely withdemand as well as the problem faced byevery insurance company of excessive claim-ing of the insured services point to the needto further strengthen individual responsibilityvia patients’ co-payments. Another generaloption could be to concentrate the range ofservices provided on major risks.
The distribution of the financial burden has
both interpersonal and intergenerational as-pects. The interpersonal distribution effectsinherent to the statutory health insurancescheme, which go beyond mere risk-sharingbetween healthy and sick people, concernnot only distribution between higher andlower-income earners but also between sin-gle persons and families, men and womenand, finally, between younger and older
people. These distribution mechanisms em-brace only the compulsorily insured members’income up to the contribution ceiling. Thedistribution effects are largely non-transparent. Transparency could be increasedconsiderably if the insurance element were tobe separated from the interpersonal redistri-bution aspect, thus allowing the social com-pensation component to be financed moreappropriately – including from a social pointof view.
The intergenerational redistribution problems
of the pay-as-you-go statutory health insur-ance scheme stem primarily from the processof demographic change. This threatens con-siderable additional burdens for future gener-ations. With the help of increased individualfunding, higher contributions could be betteraccommodated in the future – albeit at theexpense of present-day consumption.
The future of the statutory health insurance
scheme, as well as that of the social securitysystem as a whole, depends to a significantextent on the development of the overalleconomy in general and of the labour marketin particular. The aim of reducing unemploy-ment and increasing labour market participa-tion could be bolstered by decoupling the fi-nancing of the statutory health insurancescheme as far as possible from wages. Other-wise, the foreseeable rise in contributionrates would directly increase non-wage la-bour costs further and make the deploymentof the production factor labour even moredifficult.

(FSAP) and its implementation have in-fluenced the debate about the Euro-pean single market for financial ser-vices since the Plan was adopted inMay 1999. Containing a multitude ofindividual measures, the EuropeanUnion’s Action Plan is the most ambi-tious initiative for integrating capitalmarkets and achieving a single marketfor financial services in the EU to date.The discussions have been broadlybased and – triggered by the report ofthe Committee of Wise Men – havealso covered legislative and institution-al aspects. Whilst almost all of theFSAP’s 42 measures have been com-pleted as Directives and Communica-tions, implementation in national legalsystems is still outstanding in manyareas. This gives cause to consider theregulation of the European securitiesmarkets from a central bank’s point ofview and to address three focal aspectsof the FSAP: the new Directive on mar-kets in financial instruments, the Dir-ective on financial collateral arrange-ments and the Commission Communi-cation on Clearing and Settlement. In aseparate section, the shift of focus to-wards greater capital market orienta-tion in connection with the FSAP willalso be considered in the light of itsimpact on corporate financing andmonetary policy.

34The central bank and financial
infrastructure
Besides responsibility for monetary policy,
which is at the centre of the public’s percep-tion, a central bank’s key tasks have also al-ways included providing a financial infrastruc-ture and ensuring financial system stability– even though these tasks are not oftennoted by the public. A central bank’s stabilitypolicy responsibility, therefore, has both amacroeconomic – ie monetary and foreignexchange policy – and a microeconomic – iefinancial – dimension. From such a functionalperspective, it stands to reason that centralbanks concern themselves intensively withissues relating to the development of financialmarkets. In doing so, they focus not only onthe supervision and regulation of the financialmarkets but also on the financial infrastruc-ture. The central bank’s involvement in thisarea is due to the fact that structural changeswithin the financial system can also have adirect effect on the transmission of monetaryimpulses.
The following evaluation of the more inten-
sive integration of the European financialmarkets as envisaged by the FSAP will be car-ried out in the light of this fact. Three focalaspects of the FSAP , which are in a way illus-trative of the entire project whilst simultan-eously being in accordance with its essentialsignificance, are the new Directive on mar-kets in financial instruments, the Directive onfinancial collateral arrangements and theCommission Communication on Clearing andSettlement.The underlying aim of the Action Plan is to
enhance efficiency in bringing together saversaccumulating financial assets and investors inreal capital. The expected outcome is that in-vestors will obtain higher risk-adjusted re-turns, enterprises will gain easier access tosources of financing and, all in all, financialresources will be allocated more efficiently. Asa result, growth and employment levelsshould rise. This is why the FSAP is one of thecornerstones of the Lisbon Process, whichwas started by the EU at the beginning of2000.
Single market for financial services
A single market for financial services is an
element of the economic convergence of Eur-ope. Financial market integration is character-ised by the reciprocal opening-up of the na-tional financial markets and free movementof capital, which may also lead to the struc-tural convergence of the national financialsectors, but is hardly likely to result in totalhomogeneity. Such extensive structural con-gruence is, however, not a condition for suc-cessful integration.
1
A key feature of integrated financial marketsis that the prices (interest rates, fees etc) ofsimilar financial products converge via themechanics of the market if the economicagents are able to make decisions withoutbeing restricted to their home countries by fi-nancial market regulation. This leads to im-

35proved market liquidity and capital allocation
in the entire economic area, which may resultin lower capital procurement costs for enter-prises and more attractive investment optionsfor households.
Fully integrated markets are predicated on
the same information being available to allmarket participants and on pricing dependingsolely on the structure of the financial instru-ment and not, for example, on the place ofissue or custody. In reality, such full integra-tion of previously segmented markets is un-likely to occur on financial markets as, apartfrom incomplete information, “soft” factorsbased on economic agents’ preference fordomestic instruments – owing to eg national-ity, traditions and language – are also alwaysimportant with regard to investment andfinancing decisions.
The single currency, internationally function-
ing payment and securities settlement infra-structures and the harmonisation of legal andtax provisions are essential preconditions forthe development of integrated financial mar-kets in Europe. Nevertheless, price dispersionswill continue to exist. One reason for this isthat many investors are of the opinion that in-formation can be better assessed within anarrow, regional radius. This stance leads toan overweighting of regional assets, ie a re-gional bias. This is compounded by the differ-ences between ex ante expected risks and defacto realised risks, which may also lead to adeviation from the law of one price, includingin a regional dimension.The Lisbon European Council set itself the
deadline of 2005 for the legal integration ofthe single market for financial services. TheStockholm European Council in March 2001brought forward this deadline to the end of2003 for securities legislation. As far as theelimination of tax barriers and distortions isconcerned, the intended application of theDirective on taxation of savings income in theform of interest payments
2as of 1 July 2005
will be a first step on the path to EU financialmarket integration in the area of taxation.
Furthermore, financial markets – in particular
securities markets – require a stable regula-tory framework for the regulation and super-vision of the markets and their participants. Inthis respect, investor protection and con-sumer protection also contribute to the effi-cient allocation of capital.
The legal and regulatory integration of the EU
securities markets is a relatively difficultundertaking in view of the high level of na-tional securities regulation. The principle ofminimal harmonisation with mutual recogni-tion (European passport, country of originprinciple) takes account of this and avoids aduplication of regulations and supervision.
However, minimal harmonisation means that
cross-border financial market participantshave to deal with different regulations. Theyare therefore increasingly pressing for achange from minimal harmonisation to fullharmonisation. In the case of full harmonisa-tion, national legislators (including in the

scope to lay down regulations beyond theEU’s provisions. As most of the EU memberstates wish to retain this flexibility, the prin-ciple of minimal harmonisation will continueto be applied in most cases, although detaileddirectives with extensive comitology provisos

already come very close to full harmonisation.
Financial market integration in the EU has
made most progress in the uncollateralisedmoney market owing to the Eurosystem’s sin-gle monetary policy.
4Here, the banks’ rate in-
formation provided for EONIA5usually varies
by only a few basis points. However, in thecollateralised money market, which is nowmore important than the uncollateralisedmoney market, integration is still quite un-even owing, above all, to differences in collat-eral instruments and practices as well as
problems in the transfer of paper and taxaspects. The last two issues also apply to thesecuritised money market.
In the bond markets, there has been an in-
crease in the homogeneity of portfolio com-positions and, with that, of developments inyields. Euro-area government bonds, in par-ticular, provide evidence of this.

duction of the euro has permanently fur-thered cross-border diversification.

In the equity markets, it is particularly evident
that domestic orientation has been increas-ingly superseded by a pan-European invest-ment outlook, especially amongst institution-al investors.
8This development was already
apparent before the introduction of the singlecurrency. However, the percentage of EU-issued securities in domestic individuals’ port-folios is still lower than the value arising fromthe market capitalisation of German shares incomparison with European shares. Neverthe-less, complete convergence with the Euro-pean market portfolio is not to be expectedfor reasons relating to information costs asmentioned earlier.International composition of domestic

37The Financial Services Action Plan
European provisions for regulating securities
markets already existed before the FSAPcame into being. Initial efforts to harmonisethe single market for financial services fo-cused on classical (universal) banking oper-ations and supervision of the same.
9In add-
ition, however, stock exchange-specific dir-ectives already existed at an early stage.
10The
Insider Dealing Directive11was adopted in
parallel with the deregulation and liberalisa-tion of the securities markets,
12which started
in the mid-1980s. This Directive focused onfair play in the issue of and trade in securi-tised payment claims. It can be proven thatthe cost of raising equity capital on the equitymarket is lower in markets with effective in-sider trading laws.
13
The Investment Services Directive of 199314
– which gave investment firms a Community-wide licence in the form of the Europeanpassport – and the Capital Adequacy Direct-ive (CAD)
15were even more important for
the formulation of national securities legisla-tion. From the point of view of the countrieswith a predominantly universal banking sys-
Deutsche BundesbankDegree of integration in the market 
for government bonds in the euro area
The degree of ﬁ  nancial market integration may 
be seen from the market prices. The more the market prices for comparable ﬁ  nancial instru-
ments converge and/or the more closely market prices are correlated, the more integrated ﬁ  nan-
cial markets are said to be. Factors relevant to the market as a whole should therefore impact in the same way on similar ﬁ  nancial instruments even if 
individual factors which are relevant to valuation, such as differing credit ratings, do not always al-low price levels to converge entirely.
How far the euro-area markets for government 
bonds are already integrated is to be illustrated by the reaction of European government bonds to price ﬂ  uctuations of selected benchmark bonds. 
The chart below shows the average regression coefﬁ  cients, which measure the reaction of Euro-
pean government bonds to a 1% price change in German government bonds. The estimates relate to national price indices for European govern-ment bonds with a maturity of seven to ten years. The regression coefﬁ  cients are the result of esti-
mates using weekly data and a moving two-year period and, owing to the way the estimation ap-proach is designed, may be interpreted directly as elasticity.
The closer the coefﬁ  cient is to 1, the more close-
ly the European government bonds respond to movements in the price of German benchmark bonds. The elasticity of European government bonds to changes in the prices of German bench-mark bonds is currently 0.98. Looking at the price side, the euro-area market for government bonds has therefore become markedly more integrated since the launch of monetary union.Monthly

38tem, the CAD was intended, above all, to cre-
ate a level playing field, ie to ensure that theoperations of British investment houses (andAmerican ones whose European domicile is inLondon) are also subject to a capitaladequacy obligation comparable with thatapplicable to commercial banks.
The FSAP was presented in May 1999 follow-
ing a Commission consultation process in-volving the governments of the memberstates. It is divided into four sections: profes-sional investors, private investors, thestrengthening of supervisory structures andgeneral, in particular fiscal conditions for theintegration of the financial markets.
16Subse-
quent amendments increased the number ofmeasures to 42. In order to achieve financialmarket integration, the FSAP focuses onthree core principles with regard to the regu-lation of securities markets. Firstly, EU sup-pliers are to be granted equal access to all EUsecurities markets. Secondly, for this purpose,the member states recognise the rules andsupervision of the other member states(home country control). Finally, in order to en-sure that participants can compare qualityand costs effectively, maximum transparencyis to be established.
As the extensive FSAP programme was to be
rapidly implemented, the Commission soughtways to speed up the legislative processwhilst at the same time taking recourse tothe resources available in the member states’authorities. The Committee of Wise Menunder the chairmanship of Baron Lamfalussywas established with the mandate of drawingup appropriate proposals.
17As the Lamfalussyprocedure was likely to infringe the European
Parliament’ s rights, it agreed to the procedureonly after the Commission had promised toconsider any fundamental concerns on thepart of the Parliament in the comitology pro-cedure. It is not yet possible to assess conclu-sively whether the Lamfalussy procedure,which has been applied in the case of four dir-ectives since 2001, has improved the legisla-tive process and ensured common and rigor-ous implementation and enforcement. How-ever, it must be stressed that the material ap-propriateness of directives and regulationstakes precedence over the speed of introduc-tion. On 31 March 2004, the European Parlia-ment approved a proposal for a directive ex-tending the Lamfalussy procedure to the fieldsof banking, insurance and investment funds.

17Levels one and two of the Lamfalussy procedure com-
prise the actual legislative process. At the first level, the
EU Council and Parliament – on the basis of proposals
from the Commission – adopt framework directives and
regulations, which sometimes still have to be given defin-
ite shape. At the second level, the Commission issues de-
tailed technical implementing measures in a “comitology
procedure”, during which it is assisted by two commit-
tees: the European Securities Committee (ESC) which, in
its comitology function, seeks the member states’ views,
and the Committee of European Securities Regulators
(CESR), which advises the Commission on the prepar-
ation of implementing measures. The third level involves
common implementation and application in the member
states, above all through consultation in CESR. Compli-
ance with EU law is to be checked and enforced consist-
ently at the fourth level. Extensive consultations are to be
held with market participants before and during the en-
tire procedure.Core principles

39and contained provisions regarding transpar-
ency. However, it hardly interfered with thestructures of the national securities markets.Its successor – the recently adopted Directiveon markets in financial instruments (FIMD)
18–
will now also create European stock exchangelegislation with the aim of establishing faircompetitive conditions between regulatedmarkets, ie stock exchanges, multilateraltrading facilities (MTF) and banks’ proprietarytrading systems. This means, above all, thatthe concentration rule will have to be abol-ished in several national legal systems. In-stead, stock exchange laws can in future con-tain provisions allowing banks to execute cli-ent orders in-house outside a stock exchangeor an MTF only with the clients’ consent.
The functions of securities trading are to set
prices for securities and to provide transform-ation services with regard to the lot size, ma-turity, risks and liquidity of securities. Themicrostructure of the markets is a key factorin price aggregation. In order to guaranteedepth, breadth and robustness – ie tightspreads, a sufficient volume of orders andprice continuity – the market has to be organ-ised in such a way as to foster liquidity andtransparency. The public auction market hastraditionally been the venue for this. It isbetter able to fulfil these tasks if more partici-pants route their orders to the stockexchange.
19
In the debate about amending the Invest-ment Services Directive, it was argued thatstock exchanges should no longer be givenpreferential legal treatment over MTFs andbanks’ proprietary trading systems as all three
systems are profit-oriented.
However, this view should be qualified by the
fact that stock exchanges ensure ease andbreadth of access, liquidity, investor protec-tion and confidence in pricing in a more dir-ect manner than competing trading systems.Although it may be true that the desire formore competition or regard for special clientwishes (eg immediate execution of an order,after-hours trading) are reasons against stockexchange monopolies, the increase in the sig-nificance of OTC trading platforms which isto be expected in line with their legal statusenhancement could, however, lead to a cer-tain fragmentation of liquidity with a corres-ponding impact on the pricing of securitiesand the allocation function of the capitalmarket.
Modern technologies have been making fur-
ther ways of bringing together supply and de-mand in securities attractive for a number ofyears. The problem facing the European insti-tutions therefore concerned the organisationof competition between the various transac-tion services providers as well as the resultantconsequences for the efficiency and stabilityof the financial markets. The internalisationprovisions contained in the proposed directive

The Directive on financial collateral
arrangements
The aim of the Directive on financial collateral
arrangements21– following on from the
Settlement Finality Directive of 1998 – wasprimarily to eliminate those substantive legaldifferences in civil and insolvency law whichimpede cross-border securities transactions.
Prime examples of this are the complex for-
mal requirements for the provision of collat-eral assets which exist in some legal systems.The same applies to recovery: judicial authori-sations, waiting periods and so on have to beadhered to, but stand in the way of the timelyrecovery of collateral assets at the marketprice.
Title transfer structures have been widely rec-
ognised and used in Germany for collaterali-sation purposes for a long time. However,they have hardly gained acceptance in thelegal systems of its neighbouring countries.
22
The insolvency laws of some member stateslikewise make it more difficult to recover col-lateral as they recognise neither the right tooffset claims in insolvency nor the right toseparate satisfaction. For example, separatesatisfaction is generally unheard of after theinitiation of proceedings in countries with a
“Napoleonic” legal system.
23By contrast,
both the right to offset claims in insolvencyand to separate satisfaction have been gener-ally recognised under German insolvency lawsince the end of the 19th century. The provi-sions relating thereto have also remainedlargely unchanged in the new InsolvencyCode which came into force on 1 January1999.
24
Hence, the Directive on financial collateral ar-rangements introduced the concept of atransfer of title for collateralisation purposesthroughout the EU for the first time. Further-more, it established the principle of informalprovision and (non-state) self-help in the real-isation of collateral for all member states. Fi-nally, it introduced the right to offset claims in
20According to this compromise, systematic internalisers
in listed liquid shares are to be obliged to make public
firm (bid and/or offer) prices. In the case of illiquid shares,
prices must be disclosed to clients only upon request.
These obligations apply to transactions up to a standard
market size, which depends on the turnover size category
of the relevant share. The publicly quoted price may not
be improved for retail investors. However, orders from
professional investors can be executed at better prices
than those publicly quoted if the order in question is
larger than that of a retail client. Systematic internalisers
are allowed to decide – on the basis of their business pol-
icy – to which investors they will give access to their
prices. Examples of business policy criteria are credit-
worthiness, counterparty risk and final settlement as-
pects. Moreover, an internaliser is allowed to limit the
number of transactions either from the same client or in
total. This means that internalisers, in principle, also have
to execute the transactions of non-clients, which include
professional investors or competitors (moderated obliga-
tion to contract).

41insolvency and the right to separate satisfac-
tion in the whole of the EU.
All in all, the Directive on financial collateral
arrangements seems like a small revolution(albeit only with regard to its more narrowscope of application in the form of financialinstruments and cash balances) as previousattempts to substantively harmonise collater-alisation and insolvency legislation in Com-munity law had been unsuccessful.
In Germany, the Directive was implemented
by way of the relevant Act of 8 April 2004.
25
The adoption of this Act was preceded by alengthy debate in specialist journals and thedaily press. The discussion centred on theissue of the personal scope of application,which the Directive partly leaves up to themember states.
Whilst the Federal Government wanted to
implement the Directive to include explicit ap-plication for bank/non-bank relationships,this idea met with political resistance in theBundestag. The compromise reached is that,in the case of bank/non-bank relationships,securities collateral will be subject to the re-gime of the Directive only as part of repur-chase operations, securities lending andshort-term (money market-related) monetarycredit, whereas for longer-term monetarycredit the existing legislation will continue toapply.
26
The political signal which this sends, namelythat longer-term credit relationships shouldbe denied the advantages of the Directive,may cause some concern at first sight. Never-theless, it must be borne in mind that – irre-
spective of the Directive – applicable Germanlaw already provides extensive protection inthe event of insolvency for the pledging ortransfer of title normal in securities trading(with delivery being made via the securitiesclearing system). Therefore, there is no reasonto fear that the longer-term credit relation-ships between German banks and their cli-ents will suffer any drawbacks.

28
These differences lead to long process chainsas well as higher transaction costs and settle-ment risks. Moreover, the Commission drawsattention to the absence of a level playingfield and a common supervisory frameworkfor securities settlement providers. It there-fore intends to create a harmonised regula-tory framework for clearing and settlementthrough the adoption of a framework Direct-ive. The aim of three further initiatives is tocoordinate the activities to remove barriersthrough cooperation between the privateand the public sector, to set up a group of ex-perts to clarify legal and tax issues, and toemploy competitive instruments (Articles 81,82 and 86 of the EC Treaty) in the preventivesupervision of mergers and the control ofabusive practices.
The following core principles of the proposed
framework Directive, which all aim to in-crease competition among the clearing andsettlement systems, are to be more clearly de-fined in a comitology procedure. The draftstandards for securities settlement systemsprepared by a joint working group of theESCB (with the participation of the Bundes-bank) and the CESR could serve as a basis forthis.
– Banks and investment firms, stock ex-
changes and MTFs as well as clearing andsettlement systems are to be granted com-prehensive rights of non-discriminatory ac-cess to clearing and settlement systems inother member states. This will help to ex-

framework is to ensure a level playingfield for the system operators as well asthe mutual recognition of the settlementsystems by the relevant national supervis-ory authorities. The Commission herebyintends to use a functional approach,which means that, regardless of the kindof institution concerned, identical activ-ities would be regulated in an identicalway. Moreover, the Commission is con-sidering the introduction of capital ad-equacy rules for providers of settlementservices; it is possible that these will gofurther than the existing prudential super-visory regulations. The common regula-tory framework is to be supplemented bycooperation between national supervisors.This would create a basis for a Europeanpassport for all institutions active in thefield of securities settlement, which wouldallow these institutions to offer clearingand settlement services throughout Eur-ope.

earnings transparent. Furthermore, it is tobe possible for clients to obtain only partsof a central securities depository’s bundleof services and to selectively acquire ser-vices from other providers.
Overall, the measures proposed by the Com-
mission are a step in the right direction. Bycreating a level playing field and linking thesystems, it intends to release market forces,which should lead to a rise in cross-border se-curities trading with improved risk diversifica-tion and lower transaction costs for investorsas well as lower capital costs for issuers. Allfurther consolidation will be left up to themarket players and the owners of the variousproviders of clearing and settlement services.The Commission expressly does not intend tobecome involved in the discussion about theuser-owned/user-governed or profit-orientedgovernance models. Moreover, it takes a neu-tral stance with regard to the debate aboutthe horizontal and vertical integration ofsettlement services and the desired numberof providers at the end of a further Europeanconsolidation process.
Within the framework of the intended Direct-
ive on Clearing and Settlement, therefore, itis all the more important for all of the meas-ures envisaged by the Commission to becompetitively neutral. The consistent and ap-propriate use of the functional approach withregard to the planned Directive is of para-mount importance here. However, this ap-proach is also a major challenge. This has al-ready been shown in the as yet uncompleteddiscussions about the ESCB-CESR standards,as commercial banks and central securities
depositories operate in partially overlappingbusiness areas. If the Directive were to definesome functions imprecisely, for example, inthe regulation of lending activities for themonetary settlement of transactions, thiscould lead to undesirable competitive distor-tions between central securities depositoriesand large commercial banks. Furthermore, itis questionable whether further rules for deal-ing with risks in connection with short-termloans extending beyond the existing pruden-tial supervisory regulations are necessary. TheCommission’s comments on specific govern-ance rules for securities settlement businessare very extensive as they envisage bindingregulations on clearing and settlementwhereas the governance regulations thatapply to most financial services and any otherbranches of economic activity are just recom-mendations. Moreover, the fact that theserules are not to be applied across the board,but rather only with respect to central secur-ities depositories and central counterparties,should be critically questioned.
Capital market orientation and
corporate financing
The central goal of the new regulatory ap-
proach connected with the FSAP is – as setout above – to deepen the integration of thefinancial markets through harmonising theregulatory frameworks. In essence, the ob-jective is to enable an increase in the marketliquidity in the securities market. In doing so,it is assumed that there are positive paralleldevelopments in trading costs and the user

44cost of capital. Moreover, reduced transaction
costs, which find their counterpart in declin-ing intermediation margins, are supposed toallow for improved risk allocation. The trendtowards financial intermediation beyondbanks’ balance sheets, which was establishedon the basis of a number of technological fac-tors, is also promoted by regulatory means inthis respect. The associated potential em-phasis on the orientation of the capital mar-ket signifies new opportunities, but also chal-lenges for corporate financing and, therefore,fairly directly, for monetary policy too.
Change is necessary, in particular, in the con-
tinental European financial structures, whichhave a strong universal banking orientation.
29
This also applies to the German corporatesector which – as a direct expression of the in-stitutional (eg regulations concerning com-pany pension plans) and, not least, tax condi-tions – is characterised by low equity capitalratios and predominantly bank lending-basedexternal financing. Equity financing becameconsiderably more attractive towards the endof the 1990s owing to high share prices.However, the sharp market price correctionsince the spring of 2000 has perceptibly di-minished the importance of shares as finan-cing instruments. Although it must be notedthat, during the boom period, the financingof capital expenditure through the issuanceof shares and other equity increased – in rela-tion to the volume of gross investments – itfluctuated sharply over time. For example,the volume of share issuance in relation togross investments amounted to -3.8% in2003, which means that, in net terms, moreshares were removed from the market
through repurchasing than were issued.
In view of the available choices for corporate
debt financing – bank loans or bond issuance– it is possible to make a rough distinctionbetween more “bank-based” and more“capital-market-oriented” financial systems.The table on page 45 shows the volume ofbonds and outstanding loans to enterprises

In this analysis of recent developments, there
are also signs of a slight increase in the im-portance of corporate bonds vis-/C224-vis corpor-ate loans in Germany. However, credit devel-opment in Europe and the USA also reflectsthe weak economic activity of the past fewyears. The bond-based financing of Germanenterprises is actually likely to be greater as,owing to the trade tax burden of the intereston longer-term debt, many enterprises issuelong-term bonds through foreign subsidiariesand convert them into short-term loans.
There are diverse reasons why corporate fi-
nancing via bank loans has up to now beenof such profound importance in Germany aswell as in many other continental European fi-nancial systems. Obstacles such as the formerissue authorisation obligation or the stock ex-change turnover tax go only a short way to-

45wards explaining the negligible role played by
corporate bonds in Germany up to the end ofthe 1990s. After all, the predominance offinancing via bank loans continued even afterthese obstacles were removed.
31Therefore,
besides the problem of the trade tax on theinterest on longer-term debt, there must bemore fundamental reasons for the financingbehaviour of German enterprises.
The size structure and the legal structure
should be considered first of all. The Germaneconomy is dominated by medium-sized en-terprises, which usually have established linksto a house bank. Direct capital market finan-cing is out of the question for many of theseenterprises for cost reasons. The average costof, say, a bond issue (eg commissions, advis-ory fees and listing costs) can amount to sev-eral percentage points in the case of a smallerissue. The costs of corporate disclosures mustalso be added later.
32Financing via bond issu-
ance is, therefore, an option used mainly bylisted public limited companies as they haveto comply with extensive disclosure require-ments anyway. These disclosure requirementsalso help to reduce the information asym-metry which generally exists in financing op-erations. Banks reduce this information asym-metry by means of credit assessments, whichthey carry out before entering into a contract,and through constant monitoring during theterm of the contract.
33The efficiency of long-
established relationship banking can befound, above all, in the attendant cost reduc-tions.
Bank loans can be advantageous for enter-
prises in that the originating banks usuallypass on any changes in their refinancing
terms to their debtors only gradually, whichhas an interest rate smoothing effect.
34In this
connection, close bank/client ties, which areattractive for both sides, and competitiveconsiderations both play a role. Moreover, incomparison with bonds, bank loans allow fora considerably greater degree of flexibility if asubsequent adjustment of the payment obli-Corporate financing,

32However, it is possible that capital market financing
via intermediaries will become more relevant for small
and medium-sized enterprises – namely through using
bank loans as collateral for the issuance of securities,
ie asset-backed securities.

46gations should become necessary.35If an en-
terprise encounters financial difficulties, alending bank is usually prepared to grant re-lief from payment obligations if it considersthe enterprise to be viable. In the case ofbond issues, however, negotiations on debtrestructuring often prove to be very difficultor sometimes even impossible owing to thelarge number of (normally anonymous) bondcreditors.
Although it may be argued (according to the
Modigliani-Miller theorem) that the methodof financing is irrelevant in a perfect capitalmarket, empirically more robust approacheshighlight the importance of various financingoptions for an enterprise’s development.
36
The capital market is, in particular, normallynot yet open to young and innovative enter-prises, which are not very transparent froman informational point of view. The same usu-ally applies for size reasons. Although a cap-ital base can be acquired via private equity,young enterprises are particularly dependenton bank lending for their external financingneeds.
The issuance of corporate bonds (including
short-term borrowing by way of commercialpaper) has been gathering pace in Europesince around the end of the 1990s, but mar-ketable external capital is still of secondaryimportance for corporate financing in Ger-many. One reason for this development wasthe introduction of the euro, which furtheredthe convergence of the previously nationalbond markets and the emergence of a broadand deep euro capital market. Moreover,high investment volumes during the technol-ogy boom as well as for mergers and acquisi-
tions could be financed only via the capitalmarket. The issuance of corporate bonds ac-cordingly focused on a few industry sectors,such as the car and air transport industry andtelecommunication and IT enterprises. Therewere also demand-side stimuli for an upturnin the corporate bond market. Thus, institu-tional investors became more importantworldwide. These investors are increasinglyon the lookout for investment alternatives togovernment bonds and bank debt securitieswhich have dominated up to now. The de-cline in yields in the market for governmentbonds has further reinforced this trend.
37The
possibility of investing in a broad and deepmarket is particularly important for institu-tional investors.
A greater capital market orientation in cor-
porate financing raises the question of howthis will affect the stability of enterprises andthe financial system. Additional financing op-tions basically lead to a diversification of fi-nancing methods and thus to increased mar-ket efficiency and also, in principle, to greaterrobustness. On the other hand, the markeddecline in commercial paper programmes fol-lowing the market corrections, for instance,shows that obtaining market access cansometimes also be difficult.

47enon which emerges on both the credit mar-
ket and the bond market at the same time,this reciprocal interchange of financingsources is empirically rather implausible. Evi-dence of such a connection is provided by thevolatility of the financing flows in both formsof debt financing in relation to total debt fi-nancing as well as the correlations betweenthe financing flows.
38
A comparison of the financing flows in euro-area bond and credit financing from the firstquarter of 1998 to the third quarter of 2003reveals a variation coefficient of 0.57 forcredit financing and 0.77 for bond finan-cing.
39The financing flows in bond financing
therefore tend to be more volatile than incredit financing. As enterprises are interestedin stable financing flows for reasons of plan-ning certainty, they will take the greater vola-tility of bond financing into consideration intheir business decisions, even if the compari-son of variation coefficients does not revealwhether the wider dispersion is caused bydemand-side or supply-side factors.
The correlation between the financing flows
sheds further light on the degree of inter-changeability of the two forms of debt finan-cing. If it is negative, this indicates that the fi-nancing sources tend to develop in oppositedirections and would, in this respect, comple-ment each other in some situations. There is aweakly positive correlation of 0.17 for theaforementioned period, which suggests thatthe two financing sources develop relativelyindependently of one another. A decline incredit financing is therefore not automaticallycountered by an increase in direct capitalmarket financing. However, the emergence
of a larger corporate bond market expandsthe range of financing possibilities availableto enterprises.
The increased integration of the EU financial
markets is also changing their microstructure.The trend towards a more intensive capitalmarket orientation in the development of ex-ternal financing sources is likely to continue.With respect to the effects of integrated cap-ital markets – which in a positive market en-vironment are distinguished by increased li-quidity and efficient capital and risk allocation– market access restrictions cannot be ruledout. In recessionary periods in particular, ac-cess to external funds is sometimes noticeablymore difficult in capital market-dominatedsystems. An accentuation of financial cycles isthen an almost inevitable consequence.
40
In the past, lending in relationship banking-oriented systems was less volatile in reces-sions. These systems thus helped to stabilisethe economy as a whole.
41The increase in
the significance of the financial markets,which is accentuated by the efforts to inte-grate the European capital market, is likely toheighten robustness. In particular, the possi-

A robust financial system is an essential pre-requisite for a successful monetary policy. Inthis respect, there is a large degree of consist-ency between a central bank’s key task of en-suring monetary stability and its efforts to
safeguard financial stability. Conversely, thismeans that, with an intensified capital marketorientation, monetary policy makers have toreview their operational measures for any po-tential impact on the financial markets. This isbecause greater financial market integrationchanges the backdrop against which monet-ary impulses are transmitted.

49Initial experience with
the new monetary
policy framework
and the Bundesbank’s
contribution to
liquidity management
by the EurosystemIn 2002 the Eurosystem carried out a
thorough efficiency analysis of its mon-etary policy instruments and presentedvarious suggestions for operational im-provements for discussion in a publicconsultation procedure. One particularaim was to avoid underbidding in themain refinancing operations, thisbeing undesirable from a monetarypolicy point of view. Taking account ofthe results of the analysis as well as thecomments and suggestions made bymarket participants, the GoverningCouncil of the ECB decided in January2003 to make the reserve maintenanceperiods more flexible and to shortenthe maturity of the main refinancingoperations from two weeks to one. InMarch 2004 the monetary policy instru-ments were changed to reflect thenew minimum reserve and tender re-gime. This article depicts and analysesthe experience of working with thenew monetary policy frameworkthrough four reserve maintenanceperiods. The changeover went smooth-ly; the more flexible reserve mainten-ance period and the shorter maturityof the main refinancing operations ful-filled expectations during the reviewperiod. The article also looks at theBundesbank’s contribution to liquiditymanagement by the Eurosystem andthe expanded publication of liquiditydata related to the main refinancingoperations executed in the new mon-etary policy framework.

50An overview of changes to the monetary
policy instruments1
The Eurosystem’s liquidity management taskis to forecast the need for central bankmoney in the euro area as accurately as pos-sible and to cover it through open market op-erations. The aim of liquidity management isto keep the overnight rate in the interbankmarket close to the rate on the main refinan-cing operations. Liquidity management there-fore implements the ECB’s monetary policydecisions in the money market and is the firstlink in the monetary policy transmission pro-cess. Furthermore, liquidity management en-sures that the credit institutions are able tofulfil their minimum reserve requirementswithout undue difficulty.
From the start of European monetary union
to the beginning of 2004, the reserve main-tenance periods started on the 24th calendarday of one month and ended on the 23rd cal-endar day of the following month and wereindependent of the Governing Council meet-ings. Changes to the key interest rates oc-curred within a reserve maintenance periodand during the maturity of the two-weekmain refinancing operations, ie changes tothe rate on the standing facilities took effecton the very next day following an interestrate decision and changes in the terms andconditions of the main tenders became ef-fective with the next operation. Accordingly,the bidding behaviour of the Eurosystem’scounterparties also depended on their inter-est rate expectations. After the Eurosystemhad switched in June 2000 to variable ratetenders, primarily because of the problem ofoverbidding with the previous fixed rate ten-
der procedure,
2the environment of low inter-
est rate expectations often led to heavyunderbidding, which had an adverse effecton liquidity management in the Eurosystem.
3
As a result, since early March 2004 the re-serve maintenance period has been timed tocoincide with the monthly monetary policymeetings of the Governing Council of theECB. The reserve maintenance period nowstarts on the settlement day of the main refi-nancing operation following the GoverningCouncil meeting for which the monthly as-sessment of the monetary policy stance isscheduled (as a rule, the first meeting of themonth). Now that the scheduling of the re-serve maintenance period has been adjusted,changes in the interest rate on the main refi-nancing operations (the minimum bid rate inthe case of variable rate tenders and – cur-rently not in use – the fixed interest rate forfixed rate tenders) as well as on the standingfacilities do not take effect until the start ofthe new reserve maintenance period. Centralbank rates can no longer be adjusted during

to the monetary policy stance as a rule only at its first

51the reserve maintenance period; however, if
necessary, the Governing Council of the ECBmay deviate from this rule. The additionalstep of shortening the maturity of the mainrefinancing operations to one week meansthat there is no longer an overlap with thefollowing reserve maintenance period. There-fore, interest rate expectations should nolonger influence counterparties’ bidding be-haviour in the main refinancing operations.
Changing the timing of the reserve mainten-
ance period also ensures that the mainten-ance period always starts on a TARGET oper-ating day and that recourse to the standingfacilities, which is concentrated at the end ofthe reserve maintenance period, is no longercarried over into the new reserve mainten-ance period. Furthermore, the reserve main-tenance period generally ends on a TARGET
operating day, which makes it easier for creditinstitutions to carry out final fine-tuning atthe end of the reserve maintenance period.For security reasons as well as to avoid reserveshortfalls, credit institutions tend to keephigher balances than absolutely necessary atthe central bank towards the end of the re-serve maintenance period. Whenever the re-serve maintenance period ended at the week-end or on a TARGET closing day, large, gen-erally non-interest-bearing excess reservestended to be held.

52typically generates a large degree of volatility
among the autonomous factors, which madeit difficult, in the past, to conduct an accurateallotment policy towards the end of the re-serve maintenance period and generally ham-pered liquidity at the start of the new reserveperiod. In order to provide bidders in themain refinancing operations with additionalinformation and to grant market participantsbetter insight into the ECB’s allotment policy,since the transition to weekly main refinan-
cing operations the ECB has been publishingthe “benchmark allotment” on each biddingand allotment day in these operations.
4This
is the allotment amount which allows coun-terparties to fulfil their minimum reserve re-quirements without any problems.
Finally, against the backdrop of overall in-
creasing refinancing needs, the volume of thethree longer-term refinancing operations out-standing was raised by 310 billion each to
325 billion at the start of 2004; the liquidity
provided by these operations therefore nowamounts to 375 billion. As a rule, allotment in
the longer-term refinancing operations nowtakes place on the last Wednesday of eachcalendar month, with settlement on the fol-lowing day. The increase also reflects the find-ings of the public consultation procedure, inwhich credit institutions expressed the desireto counteract the reduction in the average re-financing maturity – a natural result of short-ening the maturity of the main refinancingoperations – and to mitigate the higher oper-ational and liquidity management risks associ-ated with consecutive weekly main refinan-cing operations.

539 March 2004) as a transition to the new re-
serve maintenance period regime. Ratherthan setting a very short transitional period(24 January to 10 February), the reserveperiod was extended to just over six weeks,offering the institutions subject to the min-imum reserve requirements the advantage ofbeing able to exploit the flexibility of the aver-aging provision during the transitional period,too. Moreover, the solution appeared logicalas the new reserve maintenance period re-gime, synchronised with the scheduled meet-ings of the Governing Council of the ECB,will occasionally also result in “long” reservemaintenance periods. The transitional periodand the first four reserve maintenanceperiods (now synchronised with the monetarypolicy meetings of the Governing Council ofthe ECB) went smoothly. The German creditinstitutions made the IT adjustments neededto deal with the bookkeeping in the new vari-able periods in good time, thus avoiding anyincrease in non-compliance with minimum re-serve requirements in the transitional periodor in the reserve maintenance periods todate. In addition, since the introduction of itsnew account management system in January2004, the Bundesbank has provided each in-stitution subject to the minimum reserve re-quirement with a minimum reserve overviewon each business day; this lists, among otherthings, the remaining amount of reserves re-quired by the end of the period. Since thespring of 2004 this new process has helpedto keep the number of cases of non-compliance with the minimum reserve re-quirement recorded by the Bundesbank atthe traditionally very low level despite thenew variable periods.The new regime is intended to stabilise the
volatility of the excess reserves, promotingdevelopments which will facilitate liquiditymanagement in the Eurosystem. However,owing to the shortage of observed values, ithas not yet been possible to identify anytrends. Since a slight change was made tothe definition for establishing excess reserves,which has been applied throughout the Euro-system since January 2004, these figureshave been reported (for structural reasons) asapproximately 3130 million higher. Up to the
reserve maintenance period that ended inNovember 2003 data on excess reserves didnot include the balances of credit institutionswhich fulfilled their minimum reserves re-quirements through an intermediary (indirectreserve holdings), were not subject to min-imum reserve requirements or, after deduct-

monetary policy framework was to preventspeculative underbidding in the variable ratetenders in the future, ie to avoid situations inwhich the overall volume of bids is not suffi-cient to allow the allotment that would benecessary from a liquidity policy perspective.In the past, underbidding occurred whenmarket participants expected rates to be cutwithin the ongoing reserve maintenanceperiod and, in the hope of a lower minimumbid rate being set in the subsequent main re-financing operations, therefore held backwith their bids for the current tender oper-ation. Underbidding led to short-term liquid-ity shortages and to undesirable upward fluc-tuations in the money market rates althoughthe market had expected interest rates cuts.This potentially hindered the Eurosystem’s li-quidity management and helped to weakenthe intended monetary signal. Since the tran-sition to the new reserve maintenance periodand tender regime in March of this year, therehave been no cases of speculative underbid-ding. The overall interest rate environmenthas proved to be very stable since the keyinterest rate cut in June of last year, with theresult that even before the transition to the
new monetary policy framework no morespeculative underbidding took place.
Even so, in the spring of this year slight
underbidding occurred twice – this was re-lated, however, to the interest rate spread.Such underbidding can occur when the dif-ference between the short-term money mar-ket rates and the marginal interest rate onthe main refinancing operations has nar-rowed to such an extent that, in particular,credit institutions which are normally active inthe money market limit their bid volumesconsiderably since dealing in tender liquidityno longer offers them attractive margins.Underbidding related to the interest ratespread occurred in the main refinancing oper-ations settled on 23 February (ie in the transi-tional period) and 24 March. These two caseswere each preceded by a phase in the moneymarket during which overnight money was atthe level of the minimum bid rate or only oneor two basis points above it.
During the public consultation procedure of
autumn 2002, market participants expressedtheir concern that eliminating the overlap inthe main refinancing operations and the re-sultant concentration of the entire transfer ofliquidity from the main refinancing operationson one day might lead to an increase in theamount of interest rate bids (”safety bids“),which would be reflected in an increasedspread between the marginal and theweighted allotment rates and the minimumbid rate. Moreover, if only one, and thereforea completely rotating, main refinancing oper-ation were outstanding, the institutions

55might be inclined to make price-boosting
safety bids in order to avoid being given anunderallotment or a zero allotment. However,in the first half of 2004 credit institutions’bidding behaviour gave no indication ofsafety bids being placed. On the one hand,since mid-February 2004 the spread betweenthe marginal allotment rate and the minimumbid rate has been almost consistently at zero,meaning that as a rule each credit institutionhas always been allotted at least a portion ofits bid; on the other hand, owing to the ex-tremely narrow spread between the marginalmain refinancing rate and the overnight rateduring this period, a potential zero allotmentin the main refinancing operation would nothave presented any major financial risk to thecredit institution concerned.So far there has also been no confirmation of
the concern expressed in the public consult-ation that, in the future, following the maintender allotments, money market playersmight find themselves confronted by a situ-ation in which a large volume of central bankcredit has to be redistributed but the redistri-bution might well be hindered by the creditlines set by the institutions in interbank trade.
Since the transition to the new reserve main-
tenance period and tender regime, the lastmain refinancing operation of a reserveperiod has been regularly allotted seven daysbefore and settled six days before the end ofthe reserve period; by contrast, before thechangeover, the lag between the allotmentday of the last tender operation and the endof the reserve period was usually only a fewPer-

There has thus been an extension of the
period of time in which the banks have todeal with greater uncertainty about the ad-equacy of the liquidity situation at the end ofa reserve period. From a liquidity policy per-spective, we will have to wait and see if thiswill lead to a systematic increase in the volatil-ity of the overnight rates towards the end ofa reserve maintenance period. The extensionof this period of time also increases the risk oferrors being made in the Eurosystem’s assess-ment of future liquidity needs and hence to apotential mismatch in the final tender allot-ment in the reserve maintenance period. Thiscould lead to increased recourse to the de-posit or marginal lending facility and to great-er fluctuation of the overnight rate towardsthe end of the period, which in turn could en-courage the use of fine-tuning operations.Compared with the previous procedure, how-ever, the new operational framework has notyet led to a significant increase in the use ofthe standing facilities.
To date, only one fine-tuning operation has
been conducted under the new system. On11 May 2004 – the end of a reserve mainten-ance period – for one day the Eurosystem ab-sorbed liquidity amounting to 313 billion by
collecting fixed-term deposits (by means of afixed rate tender at 2%). This measure wasannounced one day in advance. A largeamount of excess liquidity had occurred fol-lowing the last regular main tender in the re-serve maintenance period as a result of agross overestimation of liquidity needs arisingfrom autonomous factors and consequentlythe overnight rate had fallen well below theofficial central bank rate of 2%. Immediately
after it had been announced that fixed-termdeposits would be collected, the overnightrates stabilised and as a result, recourse tothe standing facilities generally remained low– in fact, on balance, it was at the lowestlevel ever seen at the end of a reserve period.All in all, the quality of the assessments of fu-ture liquidity needs appears to be goodenough to allow the Eurosystem to continueits policy of making very limited use of fine-tuning operations under the new regime,too. This reticence can also be explained bythe fact that only a select group of counter-parties is eligible to take part in fine-tuningoperations, leading to a situation in which,for operational reasons, counterparties arenot treated equally. In addition, the very se-lective use of fine-tuning instruments helps tomaintain incentives to trade in the moneymarket (intertemporal arbitrage, risk-taking),ie to maintain the breadth and depth of theinterbank money market, with the result thatshortages in the short-term money marketare always reflected in prices.
Since March of this year, the allotment vol-
umes of the main refinancing operationshave not deviated (with the exception of theunderbid tender settled on 24 March) fromthe published benchmark allotment. Hence,the ECB reaffirmed its intention to base its al-lotment decisions closely on current liquidityneeds until further notice. Publishing the

57benchmark allotment allows market partici-
pants to assess the ECB’S allotment policymore precisely and to gear their bids more ef-ficiently to that policy. Since the start of2004, the bid-to-cover ratio has stabilised ata low level and is largely free of volatility. Bid-to-cover ratios which remain just slightlyabove 1 for lengthy periods of time simplifyconsiderably counterparties’ bid decisionsand result in an appropriate primary alloca-tion of central bank liquidity. By contrast,high and particularly volatile bid-to-coverratios require bidders to also undertake a tac-tical assessment with respect to the develop-ment of the bid-to-cover ratio and can thuslead initially to a less efficient allocation ofliquidity.Bidding activity in the main refinancing oper-
ations has increased since the spring of thisyear. Whereas in 2003 an average of 267 bid-ders took part in the Eurosystem’s main refi-nancing operations, under the new regimethe number of bidding institutions has risensteadily to just under 400, a figure which waslast reached in the first half of 2002. The in-crease in the number of bidders in the mainrefinancing operations could be due in partto the transition to a weekly maturity and theattendant shorter – and for some credit insti-tutions more attractive – lock-in periods forthe collateral which has to be deposited withthe central banks. The constellation of themoney market rates during the period underreview probably also played a role.

58and the overnight rate resulted in a consider-
able reduction of the risks associated withplacing bids during a variable rate tender, ietaking what, with hindsight, turns out to bethe wrong decision with respect to the inter-est rate bid or the amount allotted. As a re-sult, bidding directly in a central bank tenderbecame more attractive for smaller credit in-stitutions which are less active in the moneymarket.
The sharp increase in the number of German
bidders is particularly striking. However, thistrend contrasts with the occasional fall in theshare of Bundesbank counterparties in thevolume of the main refinancing operationsoutstanding. This was due to a considerabletemporary decrease in the volume outstand-ing of German central bank refinancing at asmall group of German institutions which
traditionally have been particularly active inthe money market. In mid-2003, in the run-up to the last interest rate cut, these institu-tions accounted for just over 60% of the vol-ume outstanding of German refinancing;their share dropped sharply in the spring of2004 and has since stabilised again at around40%. The bidding behaviour of these institu-tions determines to a large degree the trendsin central bank refinancing of German institu-tions in terms of volume and generally exertsa perceptible influence on the cross-border li-quidity flows of the German banking systemas a whole. Measured in terms of the intra-Eurosystem claims related to TARGET, in thepast German credit institutions have mostlybeen net exporters of central bank liquidity.Owing in part to the declining involvement ofseveral German institutions which are activein the money market, the German bankingindustry has been a net importer of liquiditysince the autumn of 2003. German credit in-stitutions did not become net exporters ofcentral bank liquidity until the end of theperiod under review, when the German shareof refinancing credit expanded again. Thebidding behaviour of the leading Germanmoney market players in the tender oper-ations since September 2003 was possiblyalso a reaction to the deteriorating businessopportunities in the interbank money market.The Eonia overnight interest rate remainedclose to the minimum bid rate, thus consider-ably reducing the margin attainable in theinterbank money market, which also led tothe aforementioned interest rate spread re-lated underbidding in March 2004.

59volumes of the leading German bidders may
have led to stronger bidding by smaller Ger-man institutions in the tender operations.This suggests that these credit institutions arereplacing borrowing in the domestic inter-bank money markets (they are not used,however, to employing cross-border liquidityto cover their liquidity needs).
In the public consultation procedure, credit
institutions advocated retaining the longer-term refinancing operations because they didnot consider unsecured longer-term moneymarket operations or the longer-term inter-bank repo market to be entirely viable substi-tutes for longer-term central bank financing.In actual fact, interest in the main refinancingoperations has grown; the number of biddershas increased. German credit institutions arestill among the most active participants. Therelatively favourable allotment rates are alsolikely to have contributed to the increased at-tractiveness of the longer-term refinancingoperations: the spread between the allotmentrates of the longer-term refinancing oper-ations and the three-month Eonia swap rate,which in 2003 was still several basis points,has virtually eroded away.
Viability of the adjusted monetary policy
instruments
In the first months since the transition to the
new reserve maintenance period and tenderregime, the monetary policy framework hasproved effective and completely fulfilled itsfunctions. The ECB’s control over the margin-al interest rate on the main refinancing oper-ations and the short-term money market
rates has remained very effective. The spreadbetween the minimum bid rate and the mar-ginal allotment rate on the main tenders hasbeen close to zero since the beginning of theyear. The minimum bid rate has thus beenable to fully develop its potential as a monet-ary policy signal. The introduction of the newreserve maintenance period (now synchron-ised with the monetary policy meetings of theGoverning Council of the ECB) went smooth-ly. There was no evidence of speculativeunderbidding or price-boosting safety bids.The new monetary policy framework must,however, still demonstrate its ability to pre-vent speculative underbidding in an uncertaininterest rate environment. The occurrence ofinterest rate spread related underbidding hasto be assessed in the context of the extremely

60stable interest rate environment of the past
few months. To date there has been no sys-temic increase in recourse to the standing fa-cilities or a rise in the use of fine-tuning oper-ations. This also reflects not least the qualityof the assessments of future liquidity needsand that of the liquidity management of theEurosystem.
The Bundesbank’s role in liquidity
management by the Eurosystem
The ECB and the twelve national central
banks (NCBs) in the Eurosystem work to-gether closely in managing liquidity. The Gov-erning Council of the ECB sets the scheduleand the terms and conditions for the regularopen market operations as well as for thestanding facilities. The Executive Board of theECB decides the amount to be allotted in themain refinancing operations and the execu-tion of fine-tuning operations. These deci-sions are preceded by an in-depth, up-to-dateanalysis of the liquidity situation in the bank-ing system and the money market. In thiscontext, the Bundesbank forecasts the liquid-ity needs for Germany, which the ECB thenadds together with the amounts indicated bythe other NCBs for the purpose of providingan overall analysis of the Euroystem. The ECBtakes its decisions regarding the provision orabsorption of central bank liquidity as part ofthe monetary policy decisions of the Govern-ing Council of the ECB on the basis of thisaggregate.
The daily financial statements of the NCBs
and the ECB from the preceding day form thebasis for the Eurosystem’s liquidity analysis.
The Bundesbank transmits its daily financialstatement to the ECB electronically on themorning of each TARGET operating day. Forthis purpose (as well as for a number of otherdaily electronic data transfers) an informationsystem which has been especially designedfor the Eurosystem and which meets theEurosystem’s exacting demands with regardto reliability and security during data transferis used. From the daily financial statementssent to it as well as from its own daily finan-cial statement, the ECB generates, by theafternoon of the same day, the provisionalconsolidated daily financial statement of theEurosystem for the preceding day. A signifi-cant amount of information on the current li-quidity situation can be gleaned from thisdaily financial statement and particularly fromthe changes vis-/C224-vis the preceding day. Thisincludes, in particular, the credit institutions’central bank balances and their recourse tothe marginal lending facility and the depositfacility. The ECB releases this information tothe public each day by 9.15 am through wireservices. A simplified version of the consoli-dated financial statement from the precedingFriday is generally released each Tuesday in anECB press release as the Eurosystem’s weeklyfinancial statement and can be viewed on theECB’s website.
However, scrutinising the daily financial state-
ment alone does not provide the informationobtained through an in-depth liquidity analy-sis. In addition, a forecast of the banking sys-tem’s liquidity needs calculated from the min-imum reserve requirement and the autono-mous liquidity factors is also essential. Au-

61tonomous factors are those factors other
than the minimum reserve requirementswhich determine the liquidity needs andwhich cannot be controlled directly throughliquidity management and are therefore saidto be “autonomous”. In particular, these in-clude the volume of banknotes in circulation,which ultimately depends on people’s de-mand for banknotes, and general govern-ment deposits with the Eurosystem, the vol-ume of which depends on the decisionsmade by public sector bodies. Other autono-mous factors include net foreign assets andthe Eurosystem’s net assets denominated ineuro, items in course of settlement and otherautonomous factors (such as accrued interestof the Eurosystem).
Each TARGET operating day, the Bundesbank
forecasts the German share of the autono-mous factors for that day and for the subse-quent days of the ongoing reserve mainten-ance period – at least ten weekdays in ad-vance. It transmits these data to the ECB elec-tronically together with the required Germanminimum reserves, which, however, usuallychange only at the start of a new reservemaintenance period. The ECB consolidatesthe Bundesbank’s forecast with the forecastsby the other NCBs and its own forecast of theautonomous factors affecting the ECB to pro-duce a forecast for the Eurosystem as awhole. Owing to the large German share ofthe liquidity needs of the euro-area bankingsystem, particular attention is paid to theforecast of the German share in the autono-mous factors. For instance, the German shareaccounted for around 50% of the daily aver-age during the reserve maintenance periodfrom June to July 2004. The ECB publishes
the status of the autonomous factors of theEurosystem for the preceding day by 9.15 ameach day through wire services. Average val-ues of the autonomous factors in the Eurosys-tem and at the Bundesbank for the individualreserve maintenance periods are presented ina simplified form in the Statistical Section ofthe Bundesbank’s Monthly Report (pages
14*-15*). In addition, in the February, May,August and November editions of the Month-
ly Report a separate section, entitled “Money
market management and liquidity needs”, isdevoted to the development of the autono-mous factors. The forecast of the autono-mous factors is always published with the an-nouncement of a main refinancing operationas the average for the days relevant to thematurity of the operation. Since 9 March2004 an updated forecast has also been pub-lished on the allotment day in order to affordthe market better insight into the allotmentvolume.
Credit institutions’ excess reserves also play
an important role in the liquidity analysis. Thecredit institutions’ central bank balances gen-erally differ from their minimum reserve hold-ings. To ascertain whether there is sufficientliquidity in the market, the status of both thecurrent and forecast minimum reserve hold-ings must be taken into account. The Bundes-bank therefore captures the portion of thecentral bank balances which is not used tofulfil the minimum reserve requirement separ-ately and transmits the corresponding dailydata to the ECB at least three times duringeach minimum reserve period. On the basisof these data and the data from the other

62NCBs, the ECB elaborates a forecast of the
credit institutions’ liquidity needs arising fromexcess reserves. The data at the end of the re-serve maintenance period are of particularimportance as by far the largest share of theexcess reserves is accumulated only on thefinal days of that period.
The required reserves, the forecast of autono-
mous factors and the forecast of the excessreserves together give a picture of the likelydevelopment of the need for central bank li-quidity in the euro-area money market duringthe forecast period. With account beingtaken of the fulfilment of the minimum re-serve requirements and provision of funds upto that point in time, the “benchmark allot-ment” of a main refinancing operation canbe calculated from this estimated need, rep-resenting the allotment figure which will gen-erally allow the counterparties to meet theirminimum reserve requirements without diffi-culty in the period up to the settlement of thesubsequent main refinancing operation.
In addition to the quantitative analysis, quali-
tative information is also vital to an assess-ment of the liquidity situation. In this respect,the Bundesbank maintains daily contact withimportant German money market playersand prepares this information for the ECB. Ona daily basis the Bundesbank contributes theassessment of the most active German insti-tutions in the money market with regard tomoney market developments, their expect-ations with regard to further interest rate de-velopments and their interpretation of theEurosystem’s monetary policy operations. Ifrecourse to the standing facilities is relativelyhigh, the Bundesbank analyses the reasons
for this demand. In addition, the Bundesbankmonitors the money market continuouslyand, if necessary, contacts its counterpartiesin order to gather data relative to liquiditywhich it then forwards to the ECB. The ECBultimately takes its decisions regarding theprovision or absorption of central bank liquid-ity on the basis of all these data on the liquid-ity situation.
The main objective of liquidity management
by the Eurosystem has been achieved in theyears since the start of monetary union.Measured in terms of the average Eonia rate,short-term money market rates, ie in particu-lar the overnight rate, have been close to thefixed rate or the minimum bid rate in themain tenders. Fairly large divergences havegenerally occurred only at the end of the re-serve maintenance period whenever it wasnot possible to offset an existing liquidity sur-plus or a liquidity shortfall in the currentperiod by means of a regular main refinan-cing operation. Between 2 January 1999 and6 July 2004 the difference between the fixedrate/minimum bid rate and Eonia was, onaverage, only 7 basis points, the standard di-vergence being 17 basis points; all “distor-tions” at the end of the reserve maintenanceperiod and fluctuations due to speculationsabout interest rates are included in that fig-ure. In addition, the average very low re-course to the standing facilities of 30.5 billion
in the case of the marginal lending facilityand 30.4 billion in the case of the deposit fa-
cility indicates that the advance estimates ofliquidity needs arising from autonomous fac-tors were sufficiently accurate to ensure a

63long-term balanced liquidity position in the
money market, particularly since compliancewith the minimum reserve requirement isbased on average daily reserve holdings overthe maintenance period.
Despite a concomitant unavoidable need for
harmonisation, the decentralisation of liquid-ity management is a decisive factor in suc-cessful liquidity management. Liquidity needsarising from autonomous factors tend to bederived from the NCBs’ daily financial state-ment items. This shows that certain individualautonomous factors are determined by na-tional peculiarities. These national develop-ments of relevance to liquidity can be record-ed efficiently through the decentralised struc-ture of liquidity management in the Eurosys-tem. The accuracy and the associated infor-mational advantages therefore argue in fa-vour of this decentralised approach. This isparticularly true of banknotes in circulation,where very different national profiles are ap-parent, and of the impact of public sectortransactions with the NCBs. From the point ofview of the Bundesbank it is particularlyworth mentioning that since the introductionof the euro banknotes the peaks in the do-mestic demand for banknotes previously ex-perienced in the main holiday and travelperiods have not been as sharp; however,their role in the estimate is not negligible.Moreover, country-specific developmentswith regard to banknotes in circulation arecaused by the national differences in holidays.However, longer-term developments in thedemand for banknotes could also lead to dif-ferences between the countries.Banknotes in circulation in the Eurosystem ex-
panded overall by 25.4% between 1 January2003 and 30 June 2004, while net banknoteissuance by the Bundesbank marked an in-crease of 36.7%. Owing to the particularlydynamic development of the demand forbanknotes in Germany relative to the Eurosys-tem as a whole, the forecast of the furtherdevelopment of this autonomous factor as-sumes a key importance. The fact that thechange in banknote circulation in Germany isproving to be quite unstable is making thisdifficult to estimate. In the case of the dailychanges in banknotes in circulation (particu-larly relevant to the forecast of autonomousfactors of the Eurosystem), the average Ger-man share in the same period was 53.3%,while the German share in net banknote issu-ance was only 38.1%. When it comes to pre-senting an adequate picture of the develop-ment of banknote circulation from which theliquidity needs in the Eurosystem can be esti-mated, a typical weekly pattern of changesin the demand for banknotes suggests theeconometric approach to be taken.
Monday and Tuesday are typically those days
on which banknotes in circulation decrease.Wednesday proves to be relatively constant.By contrast, there is normally an increase inbanknotes on Thursday and Friday. This pat-tern can be explained by the demand behav-iour of the users, who make most of theirpurchases on Saturdays. At the start of theweek the money flows back to the Bundes-bank. It should also be noted that on the daysaround the turn of the month there is a dis-tinct increase in the demand for banknotes.Deviations from this standard weekly pattern

64are caused by public holidays, school holidays
and particularly cash-intensive periods suchas Easter and Christmas. These effects arelikewise to be taken into account when bank-note circulation is estimated. To assist it in es-timating banknotes in circulation, for sometime the Bundesbank has been using a dy-namic banknote model, which shows thedaily changes via an autoregressive process,with account being taken of typical weeklypatterns and special effects. Banknotes in cir-culation in Germany is calculated daily on thebasis of the model and, if the situation re-quires, adjustments are made.
By contrast, government transactions with
the NCBs do not play a role for the Bundes-bank as the public sector in Germany holdsits credit balances in the money market. Thesituation is different in Italy, for instance,
where the public sector holds its balances– which fluctuate widely over time – with theBanca d’Italia, with a correspondingly largeimpact on the credit institutions’ liquidity pos-ition.
6In the former system the widest spread
of public sector deposits within the Eurosys-tem coincided with the changeover of the re-serve maintenance period. However, sincethe changeover to the new regime in March2004 it now occurs roughly half-way throughthe period, leading to a stabilisation of theongoing fulfilment of the reserve requirementby the credit institutions particularly at thestart of the period.
Although for the execution of open market
transactions, there is a single monetary policyframework for all euro-area member states,there are distinct country-specific differenceson some points relating, for example, to dif-ferences in the national legal systems. The re-financing operations are conducted in Ger-many, for example, as securitised lending,with the Bundesbank having a right of lien onthe collateral but with the debtor retainingownership, provided that the latter meets anypayment obligations. In other countries, how-ever, the refinancing operations are conduct-ed as repos, with ownership of the securitiesbeing transferred to the NCB in question forthe duration of the operation. There are alsonational differences with regard to the hand-ling of the eligible assets used as collateral.The Bundesbank uses a pooling system, ac- 5 million

65cording to which all collateral submitted by a
credit institution is used en bloc to cover all
kinds of central bank credit, including intra-day credit in the context of payment transac-tions. By contrast, other NCBs use an ear-marking system, in which the collateral sub-mitted is allocated to a specific transaction.The great advantage of the pooling system isthat changes in the value of the assets sub-mitted as collateral are normally reflectedonly in fluctuations of that part of the collat-eral pool that is still available as cover. By con-trast, in the earmarking system revaluationscan make it necessary for collateral to be re-called or released. This great flexibility of thepooling system facilitates, in particular, theprocessing of intraday credit, for which, as arule, no separate submission of collateral isrequired. Moreover, collateral that is neededby the submitting credit institution for other
purposes can be easily exchanged.
There are also differences with regard to the
operational criteria that a credit institution isrequired to fulfil before it can be admitted torefinancing operations at the national centralbank. In the interest of striking a balance be-tween obligations (minimum reserves) andentitlements (refinancing), the Bundesbankhas established these criteria in such a wayas, in principle, to allow all domestic bankssubject to the minimum reserve requirementdirect access to central bank credit.

Monthly Report

66the open market operations and the marginal
lending facility come from Germany.
All this shows that the decentralised structure
of liquidity management within the Eurosys-tem, in which information on the liquiditysituation is derived largely by the individualNCBs, decision-making on the measures tobe taken is centralised at the ECB and thesubsequent implementation of decisions isthe remit of the NCBs, is best suited to the
special structure of the Eurosystem. This isconditional on there being close cooperationbetween the institutions concerned. If furthercountries accede to monetary union, theneed for harmonisation will tend to increase.It will depend on cooperation in the enlargedEurosystem still being organised in such away as to enable liquidity management towork as well as to date.
