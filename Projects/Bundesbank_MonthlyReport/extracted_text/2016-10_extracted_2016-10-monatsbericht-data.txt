Local government finances:
Development and selected aspects
Since reunification, Germany’s local government finances have experienced considerable fluctu-
ations. Up to the mid-2000s and in the course of the financial and economic crisis they were,
overall, almost always in deficit, while perceptible surpluses were recorded in the pre-c risis boom
years and have also returned lately. Debt levels have remained very limited in comparison with
those of central and state government. Local government finances will probably deteriorate
somewhat this year. However, the coming years are likely to see a distinct improvement, partly as
a result of considerable financial support from central government. Even so, the financial situ-
ation of individual local governments varies widely, and is considerably strained in many cases.
Yet the very low interest rates are currently substantially easing the financial burdens associated
with debt, which is very large in some municipalities.
Central government financial support for local governments has significantly increased in recent
years and is set to rise again, not least in order to boost local government investment activity. If,
as some suggest, central government were to cover a larger portion of social costs, such as
accommodation costs for recipients of unemployment benefit II (means- tested benefit), it would
be essential to ensure that local incentives for using funds efficiently and maintaining the area’s
attractiveness as a business location remain intact. It is important to view the pronounced decline
in local government investment expenditure up to the mid-2000s in context. This fall is partly due,
for example, to some entities being outsourced from local government budgets. Nonetheless,
infrastructure improvements are undoubtedly overdue in some areas, and a shift of emphasis
towards investment expenditure therefore appears desirable. Calls for a swift and dramatic
increase in investment spending do not seem justified, however. In particular, appropriate needs
testing, and capacity for planning and implementation will be crucial. Central government sup-
port could help to achieve this. Nonetheless, if a local government is in severe financial difficul-
ties, once full use has been made of scope for adjustment locally it is the state governments
which should step in, as responsibility for supporting local governments with structural weak-
nesses lies with them.
Overall, the state governments strongly influence the financial situation of their municipalities
– most notably via the local government financial equalisation scheme, cost reimbursements or
restructuring programmes – and perform budgetary oversight which includes extensive powers of
intervention. Consistent oversight will be important in order to avoid local governments running
into serious financial difficulties in the future and prevent delays in resolving them. Another option
worth considering would be to stipulate that local governments may only obtain multi-y ear cash
advances from their home state government and that, as a rule, these advances should count
towards that state’s borrowing allowance under the debt brake so that all levels of government
are aware of any problems at an early stage.

Significance and impact of high- frequency
trading in the German capital market
Over the past ten years, the significance of algorithm- based trading strategies has grown consid-
erably in international marketplaces, especially in Europe. This has accordingly heightened interest
on the part of central banks and regulators in the potential implications of high- frequency trading
(HFT) on market stability and market integrity.
However, the market impact of HFT to date has been all but impossible to measure, especially
owing to the paucity of available data. In order to provide a stronger basis for a discussion based
on facts, this report presents the first comprehensive empirical studies of HFT in the German
capital market.
The results illustrate the fact that it would be inappropriate to make a sweeping judgment of the
impact of HFT on the financial markets as they depend heavily on the strategies and market
phases under observation, which are also, in some cases, quite varied. This means that, in a calm
market setting, HFT traders make a considerable contribution to liquidity. However, during periods
of high market volatility, the studies show that HFT market makers temporarily reduce their liquid-
ity provision in both Bund and DAX futures. In addition, in times of relatively highly volatile
markets , some HFT participants are particularly active and can thus contribute to trend-a mplifying
price movements. The results can also stimulate the regulatory debate on HFT.
