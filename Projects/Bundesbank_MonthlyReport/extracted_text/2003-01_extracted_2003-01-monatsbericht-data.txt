ManufacturingThe orders situation in industry continued to
improve in November 2002. In particular, thevolume of foreign orders (adjusted for sea-sonal fluctuations) was up again substantiallyon the month, with brisk export business hav-ing already been reported in October. Theorders intake, which included a whole seriesof larger-than-average contracts, benefitedall the main sectors of industry. October andNovember together witnessed a seasonallyadjusted increase in foreign business of justover 2
12% on the third quarter. This meant
that it was possible largely to overcome theslowdown in orders which had occurred insummer and almost match the strong flowrecorded in spring. The year-on-year figure,which had turned positive again in summerfollowing a long negative period, went up tosomewhat more than 5%. Retarding effectsdue to the appreciation of the euro, especiallyagainst the US dollar, were not discernible inOctober and November.
In November, seasonally adjusted domestic
demand did not maintain its October level, al-though it remained satisfactory. Thus, ordersin October and November together were justover 1% up on the average level for the sum-mer quarter. There was also a slight year-on-year increase of 1
12% whereas the figure for
the third quarter had been -212%.
Industrial output rose significantly in Novem-
ber having previously dropped to quite a lowlevel not least owing to the prevailing patternOrders

one major reason for the average level of out-put in the October-November period being aseasonally adjusted
12% down on the third
quarter. Nevertheless, this still signified ayear-on-year increase of somewhat morethan 1%. Output thus showed a rise on theyear again for the first time in quite a longwhile.
ConstructionNovember 2002 still failed to bring a turn for
the better in construction. Construction out-put did pick up somewhat, however – partlyas a result of the comparatively mild weather.Seasonally adjusted output in November wasconsiderably higher than in the previousmonth. The average figure for the third quar-ter is scarcely likely to have been matched inOctober and November, however. The figurescurrently available show too low a level ofoutput for the summer months, as they donot yet include the usual upward revision re-sulting from this year’s overall survey. A year-on-year comparison, which is not affected bythe impending revisions, shows a fall of 5
12%
for the October-November period.
In October (the last month for which figures
are currently available), construction orderscontinued to fall in seasonally adjusted termsand were around 1
34% down on the third-
quarter level. This signifies a year-on-year de-cline of 8%. The decline in residential con-struction was even sharper, with the minusfigure still in the double-digit range. The pub-lic sector also reduced its orders substantiallycompared with the previous year. The reduc-Economic conditions in Germany*

7tion in industrial construction orders was,
however, relatively moderate.
Labour marketThe labour market continued to be affected
by the cyclical weakness of the German econ-omy. There were further job cuts and un-employment increased significantly. Accord-ing to the initial estimates of the Federal Stat-istical Office, the seasonally adjusted numberof persons in work fell to 38.52 million in Oc-tober, ie around 80,000 fewer than on anaverage of the third quarter and roughly360,000 fewer than one year before. Ashardly any new jobs were created in theservices sector either, it was not possible tooffset the persistent losses in industry andconstruction.
The number of persons officially registered as
unemployed rose to a seasonally adjusted 4.2million in December. This was almost 30,000more than the comparable figure for Novem-ber and represented a year-on-year increaseof more than 260,000. The seasonally adjust-ed unemployment rate, as calculated by theFederal Labour Office, reached 10.1%. Ac-cording to the EU’s standardised method, therelevant figure was 8.5%. At the end of2001, the figures had been 9.5% and 7.9%respectively.
PricesThe price climate in Germany at the end of
2002 remained favourable. The rate of con-sumer price increase remained within narrowbounds in December 2002. The seasonallyadjusted general price level was no higher
than in November. The year-on-year increaseremained unchanged at 1.1%. The height-ened upward pressure on energy prices – in-cluding, in particular, for refined petroleumproducts – was offset by weakening pressureon industrial products and food.
The prices of heating oil and petrol followed
internationally quoted oil prices, whichstopped falling in November and began to ac-celerate upwards. At times, the price of NorthSea Oil reached US$30 per barrel on the spotmarkets. This was due, in particular, to short-falls in Venezuelan oil production and a riskpremium owing to the possibility of war inIraq.
German import prices for oil were still declin-
ing in November. Moreover, the appreciationof the euro had a price-dampening impact.On the whole, import prices fell somewhat inseasonally adjusted terms. The price levelover 12 months which, in October, hadshown an increase for the first time in quite along while, was back down in the negativerange (-0.6%).
Domestic producer prices were broadly con-
stant in recent months. In November, indus-trial producer prices were only 0.4% higherthan a year earlier and agricultural productswere 5.7% cheaper. Construction prices werebarely higher than during the same period of2001.

Indebtedness of central, state and local
government
Indebtedness of central, state and local gov-
ernment rose very steeply again in November(+310.8 billion). The Federal Government ac-
counted for 35.9 billion, almost all of which
was raised on the capital market. Federalbonds (Bunds) were the most preferred finan-cing vehicle – the outstanding amount ofBunds went up by 38.9 billion owing to a
new issue of 35.3 billion and market manage-
ment operations. Despite new issues, the out-standing amount – after deducting redemp-tions – of five-year Federal notes (Bobls) in-creased by only 30.5 billion, while that of
Treasury discount paper (Bubills) declined by30.5 billion. Liabilities from loans against bor-
rowers’ notes, which in November recordedthe highest monthly redemptions of 2002 ( 34
billion in total), declined by 33.5 billion on
balance.
In November state government expanded its
indebtedness by 34.8 billion. The borrowed
resources it required were made up mainly ofTreasury notes ( 32.5 billion), along with
short-term cash advances from banks ( 32.0
billion) and loans against borrowers’ notes(30.3 billion). Of the off-budget special funds,
the “German Unity” Fund – which partici-pated in the above-mentioned Bund issue tothe amount of 30.6 billion – moderately
lowered its indebtedness by 30.2 billion.
Local government is likely to have drawnmarginally on the credit markets in Novem-ber.Federal Government borrowing
In December the Federal Government reduced
its indebtedness by 39.7 billion. Hence its gross
monthly repayment obligation of 327.0 billion,
which was far higher than in any other monthin 2002, was only partly financed by recourseto the capital market ( 313.8 billion) and an in-
crease in money market liabilities ( 33.5 billion).
With the exception of Bobls (which rose by30.9 billion), the outstanding amount of almost
all other securities declined. This was particular-ly noticeable for ten-year bonds (- 312.3 billion),
since both a Bund and a Treuhand agencybond were redeemed. These were only margin-ally offset by proceeds from market manage-ment operations amounting to 30.6 billion.
After deducting redemptions, the outstandingvolume of Federal Treasury notes (Schätze) de-Net borrowing in the market

9clined by 30.3 billion, despite the quarterly
new issue – which raised 37.3 billion gross. The
monthly issue of Bubills was sold at an averageyield of 2.77% and once again, therefore, wasdistinctly cheaper for the Federal Governmentthan in the previous month. The Federal Gov-ernment repaid loans against borrowers’ notesto the net value of 31.1 billion.
The Federal Government’s cumulative indebt-
edness (excluding the ERP Special Fund andthe “German Unity” Fund) at the end of2002 amounted to 3725 billion and was con-
sequently almost 324 billion higher than at
the end of 2001.
1Of this net increase in bor-
rowing, just over 32 billion resulted from
higher money market indebtedness and al-most 322 billion from capital market oper-
ations. Gross borrowing by the Federal Gov-ernment in the capital market amounted to3176 billion. Regarding the debt structure,
the share of Bunds (with a maturity of 10 and30 years) declined slightly in 2002 by 1 per-centage point to just over 58% of the FederalGovernment’s overall debt. By contrast, theshare of five-year Bobls increased marginallyto 17
12%, while the share of two-year
Schätze went up markedly to just under11%. At the short end of the maturity range,the outstanding amount of six-month Bubillsincreased by half. Consequently their share inoverall debt increased to 4%. In terms ofboth the absolute and the relative amount,the significance of Federal savings notes andof bank loans declined considerably again;their shares in the Federal Government’s in-debtedness at the end of 2002 amounted tojust 2
12% and 512% respectively.The Federal Government has redemption ob-
ligations amounting to 3185 billion in 2003.
The Federal draft budget for 2003 envisagesnet borrowing of 319 billion. This will thus re-
sult in total gross borrowing of 3204 billion
according to the budget figures. This excludesnew bond issues agreed as part of the supple-mentary budget for 2002. The rise in grossborrowing vis-à-vis 2002 is primarily due tothe increase in the redemption requirement,which is around 330 billion higher this year.
This particularly reflects the sizeable increasein the issue volumes of Bubills and Schätzeduring the past few years. Furthermore, theFederal Government borrowing in the

Securities markets
Bond marketSales activity in the German bond market
made a clear recovery in November 2002.Domestic borrowers issued debt securities toa market value of 397.0 billion, compared
with 382.7 billion in October. After deducting
redemptions and adjusting for changes in is-suers’ holdings of their own bonds, net salescame to 325.8 billion, compared with only
32.9 billion in October. Sales of foreign bonds
in the German market raised 39.3 billion net;
most of those bonds were denominated ineuro ( 37.2 billion). Overall, net sales of do-
mestic and foreign bonds yielded 335 billion
in November, compared with 34.5 billion one
month previously.
The public sector increased its indebtedness
in the bond market by 315.3 billion in No-
vember, as opposed to 34.2 billion in the pre-
vious month. The Federal Government raised312.5 billion net (October: 37.3 billion) from
sales of its own bonds, with ten-year bondsaccounting for most of this amount ( 38.5 bil-
lion). However, the amount of Federal savingsnotes outstanding fell by 30.2 billion.
2In No-
vember the Land governments issued 32.4billion net of bonds and notes, somewhat less
than in the previous month ( 33.1 billion).
The credit institutions raised 39.9 billion net
from the sale of their own bonds. Sales weremainly of other bank bonds ( 38.0 billion), fol-
lowed by debt securities issued by specialisedcredit institutions ( 35.3 billion). However,
mortgage Pfandbriefe were repurchased for31.5 billion and public Pfandbriefe for 31.9
billion.
Sales of corporate bonds amounted to 30.6
billion net in November and were thus welldown on the previous month ( 33.0 billion).
Credit institutions and non-banks were more
or less equally active on the buyers’ side ofthe bond market in November. The credit in-stitutions added 317.4 billion to their bond
portfolios, most of their purchases consistingof paper issued by domestic borrowers ( 311.9
billion), while 35.5 billion comprised foreign
bonds and notes. Domestic non-banks in-creased their investment in the bond marketby315.9 billion, purchasing 312.2 billion net
of domestic debt securities, 37.5 billion of
which were issued by private borrowers. Theyinvested 33.7 billion net in foreign debt in-
struments. Foreign investors purchased 31.7
billion of debt securities in November.

shown at nominal values rather than at market values,
and no account is taken of the changes in its holdings of

11Equity market
Issuing activity in the German equity market
remained subdued in November. Domesticenterprises placed new shares to a marketvalue of 30.3 billion (October: 30.6 billion).
The volume of foreign equities outstanding inGermany decreased by 30.3 billion, after
32.5 billion had been raised from share sales
in the previous month.
Credit institutions reduced their equity hold-
ings by 31.8 billion. Domestic shares were
purchased by non-residents and domesticnon-banks; these acquired equities worth31.2 billion net and 30.5 billion net respect-
ively.
Mutual fund sharesThe resources raised by domestic mutual
funds in November were, at 34.8 billion,
down on the previous month ( 36.1 billion).
Half of this amount accrued to mutual fundsopen to the general public and half to special-ised funds. After a period of six months, ofthe funds open to the general public, share-based funds, which raised 31.5 billion of new
capital, were again predominant. Sales ofshares in open-end real estate funds raised30.6 billion. Sales of bond-based fund shares
raised 30.5 billion. Money market funds and
mixed funds, however, experienced returnflows ( 30.1 billion each). Sales of foreign fund
shares yielded 30.7 billion in Germany in No-
vember. The total amount raised from sales ofdomestic and foreign mutual fund sharesthus came to 35.5 billion.Mutual fund shares were purchased mainly
by credit institutions ( 33.5 billion), which fo-
cused on buying domestic fund shares ( 33.2
billion). Domestic non-banks raised 32.0 bil-
lion from the sale of fund shares. By contrast,foreign investors made no changes to theirholdings of domestic mutual fund shares.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account ran a surplus of
38.5 billion in November 2002, which was
33.5 billion more than in the previous month.
The increase was due primarily to a smallerdeficit on invisible current transactions withnon-residents, which is that part of the cur-rent account comprising services, factor in-Sales and purchases

12come and current transfers. The trade surplus
was also larger than in October 2002.
According to figures from the Federal Statis-
tical Office, the surplus on foreign tradeamounted to 312.0 billion in November and
was therefore 31.0 billion greater than in Oc-
tober. After the elimination of seasonal influ-ences, too, the surplus, at 311 billion, was 31
billion more in November than in the previousmonth. This was due mainly to the fact thatexports of goods rose in November by 3%above the low figure in October. If Septem-ber, October and November are taken to-gether, exports rose by approximately 2%compared with the period from June to Au-gust. The seasonally adjusted imports ofgoods also showed an increase in November,but, at 1%, the result was lower than on theexport side. In the three-month period fromSeptember to November imports were 2
12%
up on the previous period.
The remaining current account transactions
with non-residents ran a deficit of 33.1 billion
in November, which was 32.4 billion less than
in October. This was due both to a smallerdeficit on services ( 32.1 billion compared with
33.5 billion in October) and to lower net cur-
rent transfers to non-residents ( 32.0 billion
compared with 33.3 billion in the previous
month). By contrast, net factor income fromabroad ( 30.9 billion) was 30.3 billion less than
in October.

earlier). Interest-bearing paper issued by for-eign borrowers was most in demand. For ex-ample, German residents acquired foreignbonds and notes (especially those denomin-ated in euro) worth 38.2 billion and foreign
money market paper worth 31.1 billion.
However, they sold foreign shares worth 32.2
billion net. Non-resident investors, who hadsold German securities in October, returnedto the German securities markets in Novem-ber. They invested a total of 32.9 billion in
German paper, 31.2 billion in shares and 31.6
billion in money market paper. In the case ofbonds and notes the value of their purchasesof public-sector paper almost entirely offsetthe value of their sales of private issues(+30.1 billion).
In contrast to events in portfolio investment,
net capital imports (of 33.4 billion) arose as a
result of direct investment. Foreign propri-etors provided their subsidiaries and branchesdomiciled in Germany with financing fundsamounting to 32.3 billion; these were mainly
in the form of credits. German enterprises, bycontrast, repatriated funds ( 31.1 billion);
within the framework of intra-group creditoperations the amounts paid by foreign sub-sidiaries to their parent companies weregreater than those spent by parent com-panies on establishing and expanding partici-pating interests abroad.
In the field of non-securitised credit transac-
tions the financial transactions of enterprisesand individuals with non-residents resulted innet inflows of 34.5 billion. In the case of en-
terprises they made slight reductions in thebalances held with foreign banks. In the caseof general government cross-border pay-ments were almost completely in balance(-30.1 billion net). The non-securitised exter-
nal operations of the banking system were ofgreater significance. As in earlier months,German credit institutions exported largeamounts of capital in November ( 318.8 billion
net) although this was partly offset by creditsof35.1 billion to the accounts of the Bundes-
bank (excluding foreign reserves); as usual,the latter development was due largely tobalances in connection with the payment sys-tem TARGET.
The foreign reserves of the Bundesbank rose
– at transaction values – by 30.8 billion in
November.

15Reserve assets:
their developmentand importance inmonetary unionGlobal reserve assets have continued
to grow strongly right up to thepresent. Despite the currency crises inLatin America and in Asia, they havemore than doubled over the past tenyears. In the brief period since the startof 1999, when European monetaryunion was established, there has beena worldwide increase of around 35%.However, the Eurosystem, one of theprincipal holders of reserve assets, hasnot contributed to this increase. Infact, it has slightly reduced its reserveassets overall (expressed in US dollars).There has actually been a distinct de-crease in Germany’s reserve assets inthe past four years. Nonetheless, theimportance and appropriate level ofreserve assets under the special condi-tions of monetary union continues tobe a subject of debate in Germany,too. This article takes up that issue andcomes to the conclusion that, althoughGermany’s reserve assets are quite sub-stantial in absolute terms, they are onthe low side by international compari-son when measured in terms of Ger-many’s economic size and high degreeof openness. The article also examinesthe terms and conditions under whichGermany’s reserve policy operateswithin European monetary union.

16Development and structure
of the global reserve assets
After the Second World War the international
holdings of reserve assets expanded fairlyslowly at first. A rapid increase only began inthe early 1970s and has continued ever since.The global reserves increased almost fivefoldbetween 1970 and 1980 and doubled ineach of the following two decades. At theend of September 2002
1they amounted to
US$2,454 billion.2,3The start of the expan-
sion process coincided with the collapse ofthe Bretton Woods system of fixed exchangerates, which, in its final stages, entailed ex-tensive interventions in the foreign exchangemarkets. An important factor was also thefirst “oil price explosion” and the concomi-tant marked expansion of reserve assets inthe OPEC countries. Subsequently, large UScurrent account deficits and shifts in ex-change rate patterns contributed to a furtherswelling of the international reserves. More-over, many countries continued to observeexchange rate agreements even after the endof the Bretton Woods system. It is that back-ground which ultimately makes it possible tofind an explanation for the surprising occur-rence of a sharp increase in the global re-serves after the system of fixed exchangerates had been officially abandoned.
4
In recent years the increase in the reserveassets has been attributable primarily to theemerging economies and developing coun-tries, which more than trebled their reserveholdings between the end of 1992 and theend of September 2002. Even if, in currencycrises, some of these countries have tempor-arily used large amounts of foreign exchange
to protect their national currency, this hashardly had any effect on the longer-termtrend. Since 1996 the emerging economiesand developing countries, taken together,have held more reserve assets than the groupof industrial countries. They currently holdsome 60% of the global reserve assets al-though most of their holdings are concen-trated on a few more developed countries,such as China, Taiwan or South Korea. Never-theless, seven of the ten principal holders ofreserve assets are emerging economies or de-veloping countries (see table on page 18).
Of the industrial countries, Japan, in particu-
lar, has increased its reserve assets significant-ly since the end of the 1980s by means ofinterventions; in the short period of time
1The data used in this article in order to make inter-
national comparisons are mainly those as at the end of
September 2002 or, in the case of annual data, the end
of 2001. In the case of Germany, data on the reserve
assets are available up to the end of 2002 and are indi-
cated separately in the appropriate places.
2In the underlying data of the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), gold reserves are consistently valued at the
fixed gold price of SDR 35 per ounce of fine gold. At the
end of September 2002 the gold reserves were therefore
worth around SDR 33 billion or (converted) US$43 billion.
At that cut-off date the market price for gold in London
was US$323.70 per ounce of fine gold. Valued at market
prices, the gold reserves therefore amounted to around
US$301 billion (SDR 228 billion) and the total reserve
assets to US$2,712 billion. In earlier publications US$38
per ounce was taken as the gold price in 1971 and 1972
and US$42.22 per ounce from 1973 onwards in order to
eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the
value of the gold reserves.
3Owing to the high percentage of US dollar holdings in
the global foreign exchange reserves – at the end of
2001 68% of the foreign exchange reserves were in US
dollars – it seems appropriate to show the reserve assets
in US dollars. Otherwise, exchange rate fluctuations
would distort the development patterns in which we are
interested. As clarified below, this also applies to the euro
area, in particular.

the 1970s and 1980s, see also Deutsche Bundesbank,

17since the start of 1999 its holdings have ap-
proximately doubled as a result. At the end ofSeptember 2002 it had more reserve assets– US$454 billion – than any other country.The second place among the holders of re-serves is occupied by the Eurosystem, whosebalance sheet shows the combined reserveassets of the 12 participating national centralbanks and the European Central Bank (ECB).At the end of September 2002 the Eurosys-tem had reserve assets amounting to 3381
billion.
5In contrast to what has happened in
Japan, however, the Eurosystem’s reserveassets have actually decreased since the startof 1999 when monetary union came intobeing. This can be seen from the balanceof payments statistics, which include onlytransaction-related changes (ie not valuationchanges). The decrease up to the end of Sep-tember 2002 is shown to have been around345 billion (or 12%). By contrast, in the Euro-
system’s financial statement, which is pre-sented in euro and based on market prices,the large valuation gains have such an impacton the foreign exchange position and thegold reserves, in particular, that an increasefrom 3338 billion to 3381 billion was re-
corded.

5The Eurosystem’s reserve assets are valued at market
prices in this article, as in ECB publications. However, if a
uniform gold price of SDR 35 per ounce is taken as a
basis and converted into US dollars (as in the table on
page 18), they amount to US$264 billion. For the Euro-
system, which holds around 40% of the official gold re-
serves, the valuation of the gold stock is of greater im-
portance than for most other countries.
6In each case, including Greece. From the start of 1999
to the end of September 2002 the price of gold went up
from 3246.37 per ounce to 3326.98 per ounce and the
dollar rate rose from 30.86 to 31.01 per US dollar. The
dollar rate has since fallen considerably.

18Although gold continues to play an important
role within the reserve assets as a relativelycrisis-proof, non-government asset, at leastsince the Second Amendment of the IMF Art-icles of Agreement it no longer has a keyfunction in the international monetary sys-tem.
7Its quantitative importance as part of
the reserve assets has also declined signifi-cantly. Even when valued at market prices,the gold reserves at the end of Septem-ber 2002 accounted for only 11% of the totalreserve assets. At the same time, the reserveposition in the IMF and special drawing rightsaccounted for 4%. In terms of volume, how-ever, the foreign exchange reserves are pre-dominant, with a share of 85%.
8
The available data on the currency compos-ition of the foreign exchange reserves indi-cate that assets denominated in US dollars
play the most important role. More than two-thirds of the total holdings of foreign ex-change reserves are in US dollars. After an in-terim low in the early 1990s, the US dollarhas increased its share by more than 10 per-centage points. At the end of 2001 the euroaccounted for 13% of the monetary author-ities’ foreign exchange holdings worldwide,thus somewhat strengthening its position asthe second most important reserve currency.Around 5% of the foreign exchange reserveswere denominated in Japanese yen and 4%in pounds sterling. At the end of 2001 theshare of Swiss francs was less than 1%.

Development and structureof Germany’s reserve assets
The volume and composition of Germany’s
reserve assets are not so much the result ofan optimisation strategy as, primarily, aresponse to the Bundesbank’s interventionobligations during the time of the BrettonWoods system and foreign exchange pur-chases at times when the dollar was weak. Bycontrast, the Bundesbank’s participation inthe European Monetary System (EMS) wasnot a significant factor in the longer-term in-The ten principal holders of reserve

19crease in the reserve assets. Although, in the
context of the EMS, there were repeatedlyvery large foreign exchange inflows in theshort term, with the result that the reserveassets peaked during the EMS crises atDM179 billion in 1992 and DM163 billion in1993, the volume of foreign exchange pur-chased was generally quickly reduced againand therefore had no lasting impact on thelevel of the reserves. At the end of 1998,the Bundesbank had reserve assets whichamounted to DM134 billion ( 368
12billion) –
calculated at the then balance sheet rates,which were largely geared to the historicalacquisition rates.
At the start of monetary union, the reserve
assets of all participants in the Eurosystem– ie including Germany’s reserve assets –were redefined in accordance with standardcriteria.
10Furthermore, they have since been
regularly revalued at market prices.11Accord-
ingly, at the start of January 1999 the Bun-desbank had reserve assets which, when ex-pressed in euro, amounted to 394 billion.
They have decreased slightly since then, albeitwith fluctuations; at the end of Septem-ber 2002 their market value was still 389 bil-
lion.

foreign-currency-denominated claims of the Eurosystem

therefore excludes, for example, claims on euro-area resi-
dents that are denominated in euro (or the legacy curren-
cies) and in foreign currency.

20Eurosystem’s reserve assets as a whole, this
decrease reflects two opposing movements:the deliberate reduction of the reserves, onthe one hand, and holding gains, particularlyin the case of foreign exchange and gold pos-itions, on the other. Data from the balance ofpayments, in which only transactions involv-ing reserve assets are reflected, show that,from the start of EMU up to the end of Sep-tember 2002, Germany’s reserves decreasedby325
12billion (or 27%) as a result of trans-
actions. Roughly half of the decrease can betraced back to the transfer of gold and for-eign exchange holdings to the ECB at the be-ginning of January 1999; in return, the Bun-desbank received a claim for the equivalentamount in euro. The Bundesbank also re-duced its holdings by injecting foreign ex-change into the market in addition to theamounts that had arisen from the interest in-come accruing to it from its investment of thereserve assets. In this way it responded to thechange in the need for reserves in monetaryunion.
The reduction of the foreign exchange hold-
ings and the movements in market prices andforeign exchange rates have also led to majorstructural shifts within the reserve assets. Al-though, at the start of monetary union, for-eign exchange reserves still accounted for60% of Germany’s reserve assets, their sharehas since fallen to 49
12% (end of Septem-
ber 2002). Owing to the increase in the priceof gold, by contrast, the share of the gold re-serves expanded, in terms of value, by 10 per-centage points to 41% in this same periodeven though the volume of gold holdings de-creased. A slight increase (from 9% to 10%)was also recorded in the reserve position in
the IMF and the special drawing rights.
International comparison
of Germany’s reserve assets
Despite the decrease, the Bundesbank still
has the most reserve assets, in terms of value,within the Eurosystem. If the different sizes ofthe individual economies are taken into ac-count, however, Germany’s reserve assets arenot unusually large when compared withthose of other participating countries. Withreserve assets of 389 billion, the Bundesbank
held about 26
12% of the total reserve assets
of the national central banks in the Eurosys-tem at the end of September 2002. This is,for instance, far less than the German capitalshare in the ECB, which – when calculatedfor the current 12 euro-area member states –is slightly more than 30%. Of the individualcomponents of the reserve assets, Germany’sgold reserves were slightly above average(29
12%) but, relatively speaking, they were
still less than its capital share; at 2412%, Ger-
many’s share of the foreign exchange reservesof the national central banks in the Eurosys-tem was even smaller.
This discrepancy between the absolute and
relative volume of Germany’s reserve assets isalso apparent if an international comparisonis made. Although Germany is one of theprincipal holders of reserve assets, thoseassets account for only 3% of the inter-national reserves if calculated at marketprices.

21many’s share of global GDP (6%) or its share
of world trade (812%).
In international comparisons of reserve assets,
rather than reference being made to theshare of global GDP or of world trade, the na-tional reserves are often calculated, for ex-ample, in relation to GDP in the country inquestion or to (monthly) imports, and thesefigures are then compared. If the reserveassets of an economy or a currency area arecompared with its economic strength, the2001 figure for Germany is approximately4
12%. Germany therefore ranks low on the
list of leading industrial countries (along withFrance and Italy). Countries with even fewerreserve assets in relation to GDP are, for ex-ample, the United States with a ratio of justunder 1
12% and the United Kingdom (212%)
while, relatively speaking, the euro area as awhole has slightly more reserves (6%). Thefigures for Switzerland (21%), Japan (9
12%)
and some emerging economies and countriesin transition are far higher (see the table onpage 22).
Relating a country’s reserve assets to its (aver-
age monthly) imports gives the import coverof the reserve assets (in months); for Ger-many it was 1.6 (months). Hypothetically,Germany’s reserve assets would therefore beenough to finance the (total) imports ofgoods and services for about 1
12months.
That figure is fairly low by international com-parison. A similarly low import cover by re-serve assets is recorded, for instance, by theUnited States and the United Kingdom, withslightly more than one month, or France andItaly, with around two months. In terms ofthis indicator, the reserve assets of the Euro-
system as a whole (3
12months) and Switzer-
land (612months) are far higher. Of the major
industrial countries, Japan has the largest im-port cover, almost one year. Some emergingeconomies and countries in transition – suchas South Korea with 7
12months and Russia
with six months – also have quite a large im-port cover.
The calculation of the months of import cover
provided by reserve assets is ultimately basedon the view that, except for performance-related reasons, reserve assets are held mainlyfor intervention and transaction purposes. Itis assumed that an economy’s external vulner-ability increases with its degree of openness.In order to cushion external shocks, the mon-etary authorities will hold a growing amountGermany’s reserve assets within the

In this connection, however,the underlying institutional conditions ofeach monetary system are a decisive factor.Under the conditions of the Bretton Woodssystem, with fixed exchange rates, compara-tively less developed capital markets andwidespread restrictions on the movement ofcapital, external disruptions were transferredmainly via trade in goods and services. Duringthe period in which the Bretton Woods sys-tem was in operation, there was thereforeclearly a certain justification for using refer-ence variables based on imports when evalu-ating the relative amounts of reserve assets.
13
Since the changeover to flexible exchangerates and the liberalisation of capital move-ments, countries with access to the inter-national capital markets generally no longer
need – for reasons related to the balance ofpayments – to hold extensive reserve assets.Market participants are normally able to raisethe funds required for cross-border paymentson the free foreign exchange market.

13One criticism of this standard method for assessing
the level of the reserve assets is that reserves do not gen-
erally serve to finance imports but (balance of payments)
deficits; another criticism is that the approach is said to
imply that the reserves have an import elasticity of 1 al-

23the national currency. It is therefore appropri-
ate to use financial variables in the analysisand to set a country’s reserve assets againstits external liabilities or money stock. Whilethe former indicator shows the confidencefactor more clearly in terms of the externalbalance of payments, the latter takes accountof the sustainability of financial developmentsin the domestic market.

When comparing the relation between re-serve assets and external liabilities for themajor industrial countries and some countriesin transition – for many emerging economiesthe corresponding data from the internation-al investment position are not available –there is also evidence of a broad spread ofvalues, even if the countries are not alwaysranked in the same order as in the other pre-viously analysed indicators. In 2001 the low-est ratios of reserve assets to external liabil-ities were those of the United Kingdom atjust under 1% – which owes much to Lon-don’s status as an international financialcentre – and the United States at 1
12%. Ger-
many was also in the bottom bracket at 3%(the euro area as a whole: 5%). This contrastswith other countries such as Japan (26
12%),
Poland (25%) and the Czech Republic(29
12%) which, measured in terms of exter-
nal assets, had comparatively large holdingsof reserve assets. The problem with these fig-ures is, however, the focus on the external li-abilities – regardless of whether these wereoffset by external assets (and if so, to whatextent). For instance, the USA’s external pos-ition (net external liabilities of US$2,309 bil-lion or 23% of GDP at the end of 2001) dif-fers fundamentally from the German externalposition (net external assets of 3116 billion or
5
12% of GDP).
If the reserve assets are measured against the
money stock – normally using a broad aggre-gate such as M3 – the same familiar patterngenerally tends to emerge: here, too, theUnited States (1
12%) and the United King-
dom (212%) show the smallest figures among
the industrial countries. At 612% Germany’s
reserve assets are somewhat larger than itscontribution to M3 (euro area 7%), whereasthe figures for virtually all the countries intransition and emerging economies includedin the analysis were several times higher. Thereason for this probably has to do, inter alia ,
with the comparatively underdeveloped fi-nancial sector in these countries. However,this may also be attributable in part to distor-tions due to discrepancies in the statisticaldefinitions or in the customary paymentmedia; these distortions frequently play amajor role in the monetary aggregates.
Econometric analyses of the central bank de-
mand for reserve assets frequently draw on“buffer stock models”. The approaches arebased on the view that the greater the likeli-hood is of the reserves being fully depletedwithin a given period, the more monetaryauthorities seek to increase their reserve hold-ings. It is frequently assumed that this prob-ability depends on the past volatility of thereserve assets. In addition, higher adjustment

frequently proved to be an important determinant when
modelling currency crises. See, for example, B Schnatz,

24costs in the real economy, which are incurred
if the reserves are fully depleted, have a posi-tive influence on the (optimal) stock of re-serves, while higher opportunity costs have anegative influence. These correlations wereagain corroborated in recent panel studies,although the explanatory content of themodels is still rather moderate.
15However,
these studies are only of minor importancefor the current analysis of Germany’s reserveassets as, within the context of monetaryunion, Germany is not faced with undesirableoutflows of reserves.
The results of the simple comparison of ratios
and the econometric studies show that thereserve holdings of monetary authorities varyconsiderably from one country to another. Ifthe actual reserve assets were interpreted asbeing the result of an optimisation strategy(which they generally are not), the demandfor reserves would clearly be so different fromone country to the next that they could notbe captured using a single model. Someauthors therefore take a different approachwith regard to the euro-area countries. Theyassume that before accession to monetaryunion the size of reserve holdings was “opti-mal” in terms of the ability to absorb externaleconomic shocks. The changeover to theeuro is said, however, to have reduced the de-gree of openness of the participating coun-tries, now defined as openness vis-à-vis coun-tries outside the euro area. Correspondingly,the volume of reserve assets would also tendto decrease – if the national central banksmaintained their assumed behaviour in theperiod before monetary union. If this line ofargument is followed, Germany – possiblyfollowing a transition period – would main-
tain the level of its reserve assets in relation toits imports from (or vis-à-vis its external liabil-ities to) non-euro-area countries at the samelevel as the ratio that prevailed before monet-ary union in relation to total imports (or totalexternal liabilities).
16
When Germany acceded to monetary union,its reserve assets amounted to 17
12% (or
2.1 months’ worth of imports) in relation to(total) imports in 1998 and 5% in relation to(total) external liabilities. For 2001, the lastyear for which complete data are available,values of 23% (2.7 months’ worth of im-ports) and somewhat over 5% can be calcu-lated – measured against the imports from orliabilities to non-euro-area countries. As thereserve assets declined by around 9% in thecourse of 2002, the ratios (adjusted for theeffect of the reduced degree of openness) arelikely to have since moved closer to the levelsrecorded at the start of monetary union (im-ports) or to have fallen below them (externalliabilities).

serves.
16The argument implicitly assumes that only the confi-
dence of investors from third countries has to be protect-
ed. This is not necessarily the case, however; rather, with
regard to Germany’s ability to meet its international fi-
nancial commitments, it would be possible to continue to
measure its reserve assets against its total external liabil-
ities. Another possibility would be to emphasise the cur-
rency aspect and to use external debt denominated in
foreign currency as the measure.Interim

25Germany’s reserve assets in the changed
monetary policy setting
The belief described above that the new
monetary policy environment in which theBundesbank finds itself could be accountedfor simply by disregarding cross-border trans-actions or financial relations within the euroarea fails, however, to embrace in full the ac-tual implications of monetary union. The Bun-desbank is now integrated into the Euro-system, which has assumed responsibility forboth internal and external monetary policyfor the euro area. This also calls for a funda-mental rethink on the question of the import-ance of national reserve assets. The reasonsnormally given for holding reserve assets haveat most an indirect relevance in the case ofthe national reserve assets.
17
Confidence in the euro is primarily based onthe Eurosystem’s independent monetary pol-icy with its goal of maintaining price stability.The availability of reserve assets, especiallythe reserve assets of the national centralbanks in the Eurosystem, which are not read-ily available for intervention purposes, can atmost act as an indirect support. Other reasonswhich were important in the past or whichapply to less developed economies have lostimportance owing to the development of thefinancial markets, the liberalisation of cross-border capital flows and the strong role ofthe euro as an international currency. In add-ition to the confidence function, three rea-sons essentially remain for holding nationalreserve assets.– In accordance with secondary Community
legislation, the ECB can ask the nationalcentral banks to transfer more reserves ifnecessary.
18
– Foreign exchange reserves enable the Fed-
eral Government to process payments (forexample, in the context of internationalagreements) in foreign currency without amajor impact on the market; as such, theyare a means of fulfilling the fiscal agentfunction which the Bundesbank assumesfor the Federal Government.
– Foreign exchange reserves yield appre-
ciable interest income; this is an importantpart of the Bundesbank’s profit, which ac-crues to the Federal Government in ac-cordance with the statutory regulationssince the Bundesbank is owned by theFederal Republic of Germany.
However, these factors provide no dear indi-
cation of what the appropriate level of theBundesbank’s reserve assets should be. It also
17The literature gives, inter alia , the following reasons
for holding reserve assets: reserve assets serve to main-
tain confidence in the currency in question; reserve assets
are a monetary policy instrument; interventions on the
foreign exchange market are used, where appropriate, to
support the exchange rate, in order to avoid real adjust-
ment burdens or at least to spread them out over time;
reserve assets may be used to service a country’s external
liabilities denominated in a foreign currency; insofar as
this is within the powers of the government, reserve
assets may help to deal with cross-border public expend-
iture; reserve assets may be drawn on during natural dis-
asters or other emergency situations; reserve assets serve
to earn income. See, for example, J NugØe, Foreign ex-
change reserve management, Handbooks in Central
Banking No 19, Centre for Central Banking Studies, Bank
of England, 2000.
18Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1010/2000 of
8 May 2000, the ECB may effect further calls for reserve
assets from the national central banks up to an amount
equivalent to 350 billion if such reserve assets are need-
ed.Profound

26needs to be borne in mind that the present
volume and composition of the reserve assetsconstitute the starting point for any changes.Moreover, decisions on any adjustments canbe made only in the overall monetary policycontext. Besides the current market situation,further constraints apply within the frame-work of the Eurosystem or in the light ofother contractual obligations of the Bundes-bank. For example, a portion (albeit relativelysmall) of the reserve assets – the reserve pos-itions in the IMF and the special drawingrights – are governed by international agree-ments and cannot therefore be mobilised. Inaddition, the Bundesbank may not sell goldat present because major European centralbanks – including the Bundesbank – haveagreed, until September 2004, to refrainfrom making any sales of gold other thanthose already scheduled by individual centralbanks;
19the Bundesbank has announced no
such sales for the duration of this period.
In addition, the Bundesbank, like the other
national central banks in the Eurosystem, isbound by certain restrictions on the use of itsreserve assets.
20Article 31 of the Statute of
the ESCB stipulates that, apart from transac-tions which allow the national central banksto fulfil their obligations towards internation-al organisations, all of their reserve assetstransactions above a certain limit establishedby the Governing Council of the ECB are sub-ject to the approval of the ECB.
21This rule
does not apply to investment transactions inforeign currency. These restrictions are neces-sary to ensure the consistency of the Eurosys-tem’s monetary and exchange rate policy andto avoid disruptions to the market. However,they do not preclude specific changes in the
volume of reserve assets made over longerperiods of time, as is shown by the reductionin the foreign exchange reserves made bythe Bundesbank and other national centralbanks.
Possible “alternative uses” for Germany’s re-
serve assets are a frequent topic of public de-bate – for example, in connection with lastsummer’s flooding disaster or to finance theplanned bank for SMEs. The proposals arenot always in keeping with the provisions ofthe EC Treaty. Pursuant to Article 105 (2) ofthe EC Treaty, the Bundesbank holds andmanages the official German foreign re-serves. Any attempt by government to influ-ence the Bundesbank in the performance ofthese functions would constitute a breach ofthe Treaty and undermine the Bundesbank’sindependence. Apart from these serious legalobjections, however, the reserve assets can-not, for accounting reasons, simply be trans-ferred from the Bundesbank’s accounts toother agencies. The equivalent value of thereserve assets has been largely injected intothe economy in the form of central bankmoney (see box on page 27). A sale of for-eign exchange reserves would withdraw li-quidity from the banking system, whichwould then have to be made good by meansof more refinancing loans, for example. The

27Germany’s reserve assets as part of the balance sheet
Viewed in isolation, the building-up of re-
serve assets by a central bank amounts toan extension of the balance sheet. An in-crease in its assets is matched by a corres-ponding increase in its liabilities. This inter-action can be seen most clearly if one con-siders what happens when foreign currencyis purchased from a domestic credit institu-tion. In such a situation, there is an initialincrease both in the central bank’s foreigncurrency reserves and in the credit institu-tion’s central bank deposits (as a result ofthe equivalent value of the foreign cur-rency purchased being credited to thecredit institution’s account). Even if thebanking system then responds (by increas-ing its lending, for example) or the centralbank does so (by granting fewer refinan-cing loans, for example), the fundamentalbalance sheet connection between thebuilding-up of reserve assets, on the onehand, and the creation of central bankmoney, on the other, remains intact: theequivalent value of accumulated reserve as-sets has been made available to the finan-cial system as central bank money.
This interaction is disrupted – but not en-
tirely eliminated – by valuation changes inexisting reserve stocks. If market prices arerising, unrealised holding gains ensue,which, in line with the Eurosystem’s ac-counting principles, are not distributed buttransferred to a revaluation account. Withthe changeover to marking to market atthe start of monetary union, large unreal-ised holding gains accrued to the Bundes-bank from the previous lower valuation ofstocks of gold, SDRs, US dollars and se-curities. These amounted to 525
12billion.
Particularly as a result of the increase in theprice of gold and the higher US dollar ex-change rate, further (unrealised) holdinggains followed, with the result that therewas around 537
12billion on the revaluation
accounts at the end of September 2002.First and foremost, these liability itemsform a kind of buffer which shields theBundesbank’s profit and loss accountagainst losses incurred by its holding re-serve assets in times of falling market pricesand exchange rates. The fluctuations in therevaluation account can be seen from theBundesbank’s financial statement. Its high-est value to date – 545 billion – was re-
corded at the end of June 2001.
The revaluation account “bridges” the dis-
crepancy between the market value of thereserve assets and the supply of centralbank money derived from the earlier acqui-sition of the reserves. Apart from the otherrestrictions which the Bundesbank is ob-liged to observe in the management of itsreserve assets, the discussion of alternativeuses of reserve assets (in the sense of mak-ing resources available to the public sector)can only be about this partial amount. AsArticle 101 of the EC Treaty prohibits thecentral banks in the Eurosystem from pro-viding public sector financing, reserve as-sets cannot be transferred to a public sectorbody and a corresponding asset shown onthe Bundesbank’s balance sheet. When re-serve assets are sold at market prices whichare higher than the prices originally paidfor them, the ensuing holding gains can,where appropriate, be realised, corres-ponding revaluation reserves being liquid-ated with an effect on the profit and lossaccount and paid over to the Federal Gov-ernment. However, it needs to be borne inmind that the balance on the revaluationaccount is primarily attributable to the cur-rently higher price of gold and that, as faras the use of its gold reserves is concerned,the Bundesbank is currently bound by theCentral Bank Gold Agreement.

28gross proceeds from any sale cannot there-
fore be disbursed in full but are tied up in thebalance sheet. Only the unrealised holdinggains recorded in an additional revaluationaccount on the liabilities side of the Bundes-bank’s balance sheet are released in partwhenever assets are sold and would thus beavailable for alternative use. The Bundesbankhas sold a limited amount of foreign ex-change reserves in recent years and distrib-uted the realised holding gains with the Bun-desbank profit. Another point to remember isthat the (national) reserve assets continue toserve a certain function even in the context ofmonetary union. A sizeable volume of re-serves will therefore continue to be needed.Furthermore, the Bundesbank’s revaluationreserves relate mainly to its gold holdingswhich – even after the expiry of the GoldAgreement – can only be reduced very grad-
ually to ensure that the price of gold does notcollapse. The unrealised gains relating to theforeign exchange reserves totalled less than310 billion at the end of September 2002 and
have since fallen further owing to the euro’sappreciation on the foreign exchange mar-kets, with the result that the resources whicharise from the sale of foreign exchange re-serves and which can be drawn on for specialpurposes would be less than is frequently as-sumed. Moreover, any reduction in the for-eign exchange reserves, by releasing revalu-ation reserves, would lead to a contraction ofthe balance sheet total and would thus alsoentail a loss of income for the Bundesbank.

29Conclusion
The Bundesbank is one of the world’s princi-
pal holders of reserve assets; but comparedwith the size of the German economy and itshigh degree of international economic inte-gration, Germany’s reserve asset holdings donot appear excessive by international stand-ards. However, the question arises as towhether the ratios normally used to valuesuch reserves are also an appropriate measurefor countries in a monetary union. Yet even ifthis is not the case, the reserve assets stillheld at the Bundesbank are also of special sig-nificance within European monetary union:
they are a kind of “standby fund” should theECB need additional reserve assets and theyalso enable the Bundesbank to carry out itsfiscal agent function. In addition, the interestincome on foreign exchange reserves contrib-utes substantially to the Bundesbank’s profit.Moreover, any adjustments to the reserveholdings can only be made by the Bundes-bank itself within the framework of the legal-ly stipulated or agreed limits. To sum up, thebulk of Germany’s reserve assets are not avail-able for “alternative” uses.

31Role and importance
of interest ratederivativesSince being introduced in the late
1970s, interest rate derivatives havebecome indispensable instruments ofrisk management on the financial mar-kets. This has not been without conse-quences for the structure, price forma-tion and liquidity of the relevant cashmarkets. Derivatives take away transac-tions from the cash market while alsocreating new trading opportunities.Thanks to lower trading costs, informa-tion is reflected in prices on the futuresmarkets sooner than on the cash mar-ket. Liquid derivative markets thushave a tendency to raise the efficiencyof the financial markets. Under certainconditions, however, the major lever-age effect of derivative financial in-struments may also have a destabilis-ing impact. The following report firstexplains the development and struc-ture of the markets for interest rate de-rivatives and then the impact of the in-creasing use of derivatives on the sta-bility of the financial system and themonetary policy transmission process.
Introduction
“Interest rate derivatives” is the general term
for instruments whose value is derived fromthe market price of a debt security or a refer-ence interest rate. These include bond fu-tures, their related options as well as interestrate swaps. In April 2001, daily turnover ininterest rate contracts on the derivatives ex-changes was in the order of US$2.2 trillion,

rates of growth in over-the-counter (OTC)trading have been even greater, with its turn-over of interest rate derivatives more thantripling during the same period to US$0.8 tril-lion. At the end of June 2001, the nominalvalue of all open interest rate contracts –traded on exchanges and OTC – was, atUS$93 trillion, several times higher than thenominal value of all bonds outstanding(US$36 trillion).

The Bundesbank investigated the monetarypolicy implications of derivatives as early asNovember 1994.
3Back then, the article came
to the provisional conclusion that monetarypolicymakers could take a relaxed view of theincreasing use of derivative financial instru-ments. At the same time, however, a carefulanalysis of these markets was urged. Nowthat extensive statistical central bank surveysof the banks’ derivative business are conduct-ed every three years, with their results pub-lished by the Bank for International Settle-ments (BIS), the available database – whichalso covers the OTC derivatives market – ismuch better than in 1994. Additionally, since1998, there have been supplementary semi-annual derivatives statistics, which are like-wise collected by the national central banksand coordinated by the BIS.
The key characteristic of derivatives is that
their use makes it easier and more cost-effective to split off the risks associated withthe underlying financing instruments and totrade them separately. Some types of deriva-tives, such as futures contracts and swaps,may, in principle, be replicated by a combin-ation of their underlying securities or interest
rate contracts. In practice, however, this en-tails considerable transaction costs and istherefore uneconomic for the individual in-vestor. For that reason, derivatives are oftenthe only possibility of trading a given combin-ation of risks. This is all the more true of de-rivatives with option characteristics, the riskprofile of which cannot practically be repro-duced by a combination of underlyings.
According to a 1997 survey, more than three-
quarters of the surveyed German enterprisesuse – mainly currency and interest rate – de-rivatives.
4The popularity of derivatives is due
to the fact that they tie up much less capitalthan do positions in the underlying assets.This results in these instruments having amajor leverage effect. They may be used toreduce risks (hedging) or to take on risks in-tentionally. The derivatives markets allow en-terprises, for example, to separate the oper-ational policy risks of an investment from theinterest rate risk so as to make operating per-formance less dependent on factors outsidetheir sphere of influence. They allow banks –whose interest rates on their assets are typic-ally locked in for a longer period than those

market, however.

33on their liabilities – to hedge against interest
rate risks. Portfolio managers can managetheir portfolios’ dependency on individual riskfactors more quickly, more precisely and morecost-effectively than would be possible bymeans of adjusting their securities portfolios.
Derivatives complete the financial markets by
making risk factors tradeable. From amacroeconomic perspective, tradeability, inturn, is a precondition for the efficient alloca-tion of risks. For that reason, derivatives arelikely, in principle, to contribute to a higherrate of growth, even though the importanceof that fact is difficult to quantify. This funda-mentally positive impact, however, shouldnot obscure our view of the risks that mayarise from the use of derivatives. This pointwill be dealt with in greater depth towardsthe end of this article.
The market for interest rate derivatives
The existence of derivatives markets has been
recorded since early modern times.
5As early
as the 17th century, shares were sold andbought at a forward date and even share op-tions were traded.
6Trading of forward con-
tracts on rice is also recorded in Japan in the17th and 18th centuries. The basic featuresof modern derivatives exchanges emergedduring the second half of the 19th century onthe Chicago commodities exchanges. Thatwas where quantities and prices were stand-ardised for the first time, margin calls wereregulated and the possibility of fulfilling con-tracts by means of offsetting trades ratherthan delivering the underlying was intro-duced. With rare exceptions, the majority of
the early derivatives involved commoditiescontracts. Financial derivatives, which now-adays account for most of all forward trans-actions, did not make a breakthrough untilthe 1970s.
Although the first currency swaps appeared
as early as the 1960s, they were used mainlyto circumvent British capital controls andwere thus of minor importance at first, espe-cially as a world monetary system in whichexchange rates were fixed meant that therewas a limited need to hedge against ex-change rate fluctuations. This situation onlychanged when the Bretton Woods systemwas replaced by free exchange rates in theearly 1970s, leading to a sudden sharp in-crease in the demand for hedging instru-ments. That is the background to the successof the first exchange-traded currency future,which was introduced on the InternationalMoney Market of the Chicago Mercantile Ex-change (CME) in 1972. Interest rate futureswere first traded on the Chicago Board ofTrade (CBoT) trading floor in October 1975and were based on US mortgage bonds. Inthe end, these contracts gained no more thanminor importance, mainly on account of thelow level of standardisation in the potentialunderlyings. The futures (which were intro-duced shortly afterwards) on three-monthCME Treasury Bills and long-term CBoT Treas-

34ury Bonds enjoyed greater success, benefiting
from the dramatically increased interest ratevolatility towards the end of the decade. Itwas in this setting that, in the early 1980s,the basic idea of currency swaps (which hadnow clearly gained in significance) was alsotransferred to the field of interest rates. In-stead of payments in different currencies, thecounterparties swapped interest payments ona given principal amount – mainly fixed pay-ments for payments linked to a short-term
interest rate.
Even though options had been known for
centuries, the role they played was a marginalone until the 1970s. This was due, in particu-lar, to difficulties in terms of valuation whichmade trading with options a risky undertak-ing. A crucial boost was given to the optionmarkets by the development of the Black-Scholes model, which – despite its restrictiveassumptions – is nowadays still the basis forthe valuation of options. In 1973, the year inwhich the groundbreaking article by Blackand Scholes was published,
7options on indi-
vidual shares were introduced on the ChicagoBoard Option Exchange (CBOE). Index andinterest rate options followed ten years later.
In Europe, it was only in the 1980s that the
market for derivatives gained a firm foothold.Milestones in this respect were the establish-ment of the British derivatives exchange LIFFEin 1982, the French futures exchange MATIFin 1986 and the German Financial Futures Ex-change DTB in 1989. In Germany, the estab-lishment of a liquid futures market had beenimpeded, among other things, by existing le-gislation – a situation that was remedied onlyas part of the 1989 amendment of the StockExchange Act.

Thismostly concerned the long-term segment ofthe market, especially the future on ten-yearFederal bonds (Bund future). By contrast, theLIFFE has been able to maintain its marketposition in money market contracts.
European monetary union has brought a fun-
damental change to the European derivativeslandscape. This has affected not only the for-eign exchange field but also, in particular, inter-est rate derivatives. Following the eliminationof the foreign exchange risk, the differences inyields among the individual participating coun-tries have been reduced to a minimum.
9Ap o s -
ition in, say, Spanish bonds can now be hedgedby a matching position in the Euro-Bund fu-ture, even though the latter is actually basedon German Federal bonds. Although this hedg-ing strategy is not entirely without risk – theprice of the future and the price of the Spanishbond may still drift apart – that risk is generallyoffset by the higher liquidity of the Bund con-tract. European monetary union has thus beenaccompanied by a concentration of trading ineuro-denominated bond contracts on theEurex (the successor to DTB), while the LIFFEhas strengthened its dominant position in themoney market. Among the other nationalfutures markets, only the French MATIF wasinitially able to defend its market share, whileinterest rate business activity on the Italian andSpanish derivatives exchanges (MIF and Meff,respectively) has virtually come to a standstill.
10Between January and September 2002, 1.6billion futures contracts and 1.7 billion op-tions were traded worldwide on the futuresexchanges. In the case of futures, 55% ofturnover was accounted for by interest ratederivatives,
11followed by equity and com-
modities contracts at 23% and 20%, re-spectively. By contrast, foreign exchange fu-tures were of very minor importance at 2%of overall turnover. In the case of options,equity options were clearly to the fore at87% of turnover. Interest rate options wereof no more than secondary importance witha market share of 10%. At the end ofSeptember 2002, the nominal value of allopen interest rate futures amounted toUS$10 trillion, while that of interest rate op-tions was as much as US$16 trillion.

The growing popularity of futures exchangeswhen compared with the cash market mayalso be explained by the lower capital re-quired. Price gains and losses are first offseton an internal exchange account. It is possibleto sell the contracts short without – as on the

matching paper. As a rule, open positions areclosed by offsetting trades shortly prior tomaturity and the account is squared; fulfil-ment of futures contracts by delivery of theunderlying is the exception. Since interestrate futures are mostly based on a notionalbond,
13the delivered paper is converted into
the underlying in accordance with a specifiedkey. The conversion factor depends on thematurity and interest rate of the paper that is
actually delivered and the extent to whichthey differ from the notional bond on whichthe contract is based.

In contrast to the traditional cash exchanges,the market players on the futures exchangesconclude contracts with a central counter-party and not among themselves.
15This has
the advantage that transactions do not haveto be unwound if one party does not fulfil itsobligations. In order to hedge against thateventuality, the exchange demands a margin,which is adjusted to the market situation on adaily basis. If market players are unable tomeet their resulting margin call, their pos-itions are liquidated by offsetting trades.
The high degree of liquidity of listed deriva-
tives is made possible by a large measure ofstandardisation of the contracts. Tailor-madeinstruments, on the other hand, are tradedover the counter, as are those for which themargin system (for a variety of reasons) is im-practicable. This last-named category includesswaps, for example, for which regularlyrecurring interest payments – but not princi-pal amounts – are exchanged. In the past fewyears, the OTC market has witnessed evenfaster rates of growth than the futures ex-changes. At the end of June 2001, the nom-OTC derivatives trading

37inal value of all open OTC interest rate con-
tracts, at US$76 trillion, was more than fourtimes higher than that of listed interest ratederivatives (US$17 trillion).
16Interest rate
swaps accounted for three-quarters of thatamount, with 14% being options and 10%forward rate agreements.
The vast majority of OTC derivatives trans-
actions take place between internationallyoperating banks or other financial institu-tions. The market is very concentrated: justover half of all transactions in OTC interestrate derivatives takes place among some 60institutions, of which seven are in Germany.In some areas, there are only a handful ofplayers that account for the majority of turn-over. Less than 10% of OTC transactions inderivatives is conducted with end customersoutside the financial sector. This stands insharp contrast to conditions in the early1980s, when swap transactions were con-ducted mainly between non-financial enter-prises. At that time, the banks largely con-fined themselves to acting as brokers and didnot themselves contract open positions.Under such circumstances, the users of de-rivatives often found it difficult to make a cor-rect assessment of their counterparties’ finan-cial soundness. The market for OTC deriva-tives was therefore able to develop properlyonly when the banks increasingly began toact as intermediaries conducting transactionsfor their own account with the end custom-ers.
With 14% of the overall transaction volume,
Germany occupies third place in interest ratederivatives trading behind the United King-dom (35%) and the United States (17%).
Taking into account solely derivatives denom-inated in euro (just under half of the turnoverin all interest rate contracts), German institu-tions have a market share of 22%.
Impact on price formation and liquidity
Owing to the low capital input and the possi-
bility of selling short without major expend-iture, derivatives are suitable not only as in-struments for hedging against interest raterisks but also as a way of deliberately con-tracting speculative positions. A recently pub-lished Bundesbank research paper
17on the
price relationship between German Federalbonds and the Bund future shows that thevast majority of information is “priced in” onthe futures market. In turbulent times, theprocessing of information takes place entirelyon the futures market, in fact, and the pricesfor ten-year Federal bonds follow the futurewithout contributing to price discovery. Thehighly liquid futures contracts, in particular,thus have a kind of price leadership over theunderlying, the prices of which adjust to theprices on the futures market.
The impact of derivatives on the liquidity of
the cash market is ambiguous. As a rule, mar-ket players can hedge more cost-effectivelyor contract speculative positions more easilyby using derivatives than by investing in debt

38securities. The futures market thus withdraws
transactions from the cash market. The sameapplies to investors using futures for the pur-pose of acquiring bonds. Neither case neces-sarily results in the underlyings having a re-duced market liquidity, however. This is be-cause a futures market not only attractstransactions – it also creates new trading op-portunities in the underlying securities. Forexample, traders in derivatives use the cashmarket to hedge against the risks arisingfrom derivative transactions. Moreover, a cat-egory of securities may become more attract-ive overall if a liquid derivatives market isavailable for hedging. Thus, Federal securitiesowe their benchmark status on the euro-areabond market not least to the matching fu-tures contracts having the function of majorhedging instruments for long-term interestrate risks in the euro zone. According to onestudy, the market rewards the status of abond as “cheapest to deliver”,
18ie as the ac-
tual underlying, in the case of the Bund fu-ture with a yield discount of just under threebasis points.
19
Operations that might otherwise be unprofit-able may be conducted on the futures marketsince the transaction costs are lower. The ef-fect of such transactions on price formationdepends on the level of information of theplayers involved. Poorly informed investorswho use capital investments like a lottery in-crease uncertainty and thus have a destabilis-ing impact. However, investors of this typetend to make a loss in the long run and cantherefore be displaced from the market.
20
Arbitrageurs can systematically generate aprofit only if they buy at low prices and sell athigh prices. Rational speculation therefore
has a stabilising effect on the markets andthus tends to reduce volatility.
In addition to these basic considerations, de-
rivatives have certain properties which mayhave a destabilising impact. It has been re-peatedly observed, for example, that, shortlybefore a future matures, market players sys-tematically buy up the underlying bond inorder then to throw the hoarded paper on tothe market at a profit. Unfortunately, it is notknown whether this strategy met with suc-cess. What is certain, however, is that the re-sulting shortage of the underlying was onlytemporary and that there were no deliveryproblems upon the maturity of the futurescontracts.
21
In contrast to futures, the payout structure ofoptions is asymmetrical. Options thus provideinvestors with more extensive hedging oppor-tunities than do pure forward contracts. Forexample, the holder of a call option on abond cannot only hedge against price losses– ie an interest rate rise – but also benefit
18Although several bonds are deliverable in the case of
the Bund future, the fulfilment of the contractual obliga-
tions by means of a specific bond is generally cheaper
than using the other paper. This bond is frequently de-
scribed as “cheapest to deliver” or “ctd”.

39Derivative prices and delta hedging
In order to gain a better understanding of the price
relationship between cash and futures markets andof delta hedging, it is useful first to recall somebasic features of price formation in interest ratecontracts and the valuation of interest rate options.Market players’ arbitrage operations ensure a closeparallel movement of prices in the cash and futuresmarkets. Ignoring transaction costs, the price of abond future F corresponds to the price of theunderlying B plus the financing costs up to the ma-turity of the future:
1
F = B (1 + r). (1)
If this condition is not met, arbitrage opportunities
open up, the use of which drives prices towardstheir equilibrium values. If futures prices are toohigh, ie F > B (1 + r), an investor might sell a futurefor, say, 5F and buy a bond for 5B. The investor first
lends this as part of a repo at an interest rate r andthen delivers it when the future matures. Futuresprices which are too high (or bond prices which aretoo low) thus lead to selling on the futures marketand to buying on the cash market. The oppositecase of futures prices which are too low, ieF < B (1 + r), also provides arbitrage opportunities,the use of which ultimately drives prices towardstheir equilibrium values. In this instance, the arbi-trageur has to borrow bonds on the repo marketand sell them immediately. At the same time, thearbitrageur buys futures and fulfils his obligationsarising from the repo with the debt securities de-livered when the futures contract matures.
2
The valuation of interest rate options and the asso-ciated delta hedging are much more complicatedthan the replication of futures. We shall thereforedescribe them briefly using a simplified example.Let us assume that the price of a bond is currently5100 and may, in the next period, either rise to
P
H=5110 or fall to P L=590. Let us now look at the
case of a purchase option on the bond with a priceof S=100. The buyer of this derivative acquires theright to purchase the bond in the next period at aprice of 5100 – irrespective of how prices developon the cash market. If the price of the bond rises to
P
H=5110, the purchaser of the option makes a
profit of 510. If bond prices fall, the option is
worthless, however, and is not exercised.
For the option writer, a price rise on the cash mar-
ket represents a risk which he can hedge against bypurchasing bonds. The number of bonds neededfor this is usually denoted by the Greek letter D,
which is where the term “delta hedging” comesfrom. In the above example, the option writertherefore first buys bonds to the value of Dx5100. If
there is a rise in price on the bond market, the valueof the bond portfolio increases to Dx5110. This is
matched by a payment obligation, arising fromthe sale of the option, amounting to OP
H=510.
Although, if the price falls, the option writer re-ceives only Dx590 from the sale of the bonds, he
does not have to pay anything to the buyer of theoption, ie OP
L=0. The option writer can thus select
Dso that the value of the hedge portfolio, less the
payments from the option, is independent of thefuture price of the bond. In the example, this wouldbe the case if DxP
H-O P H=DxPL-O P L. This implies a
delta
D= (OP H-O P L)/(P H-PL) = 10/20 =12.
The commonly used option price models are based
on delta hedging.3
In practice, the hedge portfolio has to be adjustedcontinuously to current price developments. Thiscan be explained by extending the above example.Let us assume that the price of the bond rises in thesecond period to 5110 and, in the third period, can
then either go up by another 510 to 5120 or go
back down to 5100. The option payout would then
amount to 520 or 50, which would correspond to
D=1. The adjustment of the hedging portfolio over
time is also called “dynamic hedging”. The exampleshows that this involves a positive feedback be-tween the price change of the underlying (bond)and the hedging operations.

1In practice, r is a rate for repo transactions. — 2The arbi-
trage relationship between futures and bonds describedhere is a simplification. In practice, transaction costs are in-curred and different bonds can be delivered which are con-verted using a conversion factor. For details, see H Diwald,Zinsfutures und Zinsoptionen , Munich, 1999. — 3The
hedge portfolio, consisting of a long position in a bondand a short position in the option, guarantees a securepayment in the next period. Its current price should
therefore correspond to the price of a risk-free bondwith an identical payoff. This means that the price of theoption can then be determined. — 4For a more detailed
description of delta hedging in continuous time and thecorresponding Black-Scholes model, see John C Hull:Options, Futures, and other Derivatives, Prentice-Hall,1997.

40from price gains. On the other hand, in order
not to enter into an incalculable risk, the is-suer of the option has to adjust his portfoliocontinuously. This is referred to as “dynamic”or “delta” hedging (see explanatory notes onpage 39). Such hedging operations can amp-lify price movements since underlyings aresold if prices are falling and purchased whenprices are rising. They have a particularly de-stabilising impact if the exercise prices of op-tions are concentrated on certain thresholdvalues. The overshooting of such a thresholdmay then lead to a chain reaction, resulting inextreme price fluctuations. For the UnitedStates, it has been possible to show that suchhedging operations may also distort the termstructure of interest rates.
22
The question as to whether futures marketsincrease or reduce volatility is therefore anempirical one. An econometric study of theyield development of ten-year Federal bondsbased on daily data for the period from 1978to 2001 shows that the introduction of theBund future had no demonstrable effectwhatsoever on the volatility of German bondyields (see the adjacent explanatory notes).Independently of this, however, each investorhas the possibility of using interest rate de-rivatives to change his individual interest raterisk.Derivatives and interest rate
uncertainty on the bond market
The potential impact of derivatives on interest rate
uncertainty on the bond market is studied below
using the example of the Bund future. To do this,
the yields of underlying Federal bonds are modelled
using a GARCH(1.1) approach. A dummy variable in
the regression for volatility provides information on
the extent to which the introduction of the future
contract on Federal bonds has affected interest rate
uncertainty.
In the model regression, the yield outstanding on
Federal bonds deliverable on the Eurex i tis mod-
elled as a first-order autoregressive process AR(1):
it=b0+b1it–1+et.
The conditional variance of the disturbance item et
corresponds to the interest rate uncertainty. This is
denoted as h tand is modelled by the following vari-
ance equation:
ht=a0+a1e2
t–1+a2ht–1+g1t+g2dt.
The introduction of the Bund future on the German
Futures Exchange on 23 November 1990 1is charac-
terised by a dummy variable d t, which assumes the
value of zero before that date and the value of one
thereafter. A positive and statistically significant coef-
ficient g2then indicates an increase in volatility
brought about by the future and a negative coeffi-
cient shows a reduction in interest rate uncertainty
by the future. A time trend t was included in order to
separate the impact of the derivatives market from
other long-term effects on interest rate uncertainty.
The GARCH model was estimated using daily data
over the period from the start of 1978 to the end of
2001. The results are shown in the table below:
The estimation results show a high degree of per-
sistency of the yield outstanding in both the level
(b1= 1) and the volatility ( a1+a2= 0.99). The para-
meters g1andg2are both extremely small and statis-
tically insignificant. Thus, neither a trend movement
in interest rate uncertainty nor an influence of the
introduction of the Bund Future can be demon-
strated. 2
1The results remain largely unchanged if the estimates
are based on the introduction of the Bund Future onthe LIFFE on 29 September 1988. — 2It has been pos-
sible to show comparable results for the US market forTreasury bonds and the related futures contracts. SeeS P Hedge, The Impact of Futures Trading on the SpotMarket for Treasury Bonds, The Financial Review , 29,

41Effects of the increasing use of
derivatives
Monetary policy implicationsThe above-mentioned Monthly Report article
on the monetary policy implications of inter-est rate derivatives, which was published in1994, came to the conclusion that the exist-ence of derivatives does not affect the centralbank’s ability to influence interest rates onthe money market. Changes in the scale andspeed with which monetary policy measuresimpact on the real economy were conceiv-able, however. On the whole, however, mon-etary policymakers could, if anything, take arelaxed view of the increasing use of deriva-tive instruments. From the current perspec-tive, this assessment has been confirmed. It isonly on isolated points that the conclusionsdrawn in 1994 have to be modified some-what.
Although the existence of interest rate deriva-
tives does not reduce the central bank’s abilityto control short-term interest rates, the use ofsuch instruments can lead to changes in themonetary transmission process. In this con-text, it is not possible, however, to separatethe impact of derivatives from that of otherchanges in the structure of the financial sys-tem. For instance, the securitisation of largeparts of the banks’ balance sheets means thatcredit institutions are more dependent oninterest rates – something which banks can,in turn, contain by the use of derivatives. Inthe final analysis, however, derivatives canonly spread risks – not eliminate them. Inevery transaction, there is a counterpartywhich accepts the traded risk. This does not
necessarily have to be a domestic bank. Risksmay also be transferred to other institutions,say, to insurance companies, or to anothercountry, which means that the transmissionof monetary policy stimuli through the do-mestic banking sector will tend to becomeweaker.
Of the various monetary policy transmission
channels, the credit channel – which is basedon frictions in lending to enterprises – is likelyto be especially affected by the use of deriva-tives. That is because derivatives enable firmsto hedge against rising interest rates (andthus also against price losses in their loan col-lateral). For the transmission process, thismeans that the credit channel is becomingless effective.
23However, in Germany and the
euro area as a whole, the credit channel playsa secondary role to the interest rate channelin any case. A further weakening is thereforelikely to be of very little relevance to monet-ary policy.
With the exception of currency swap arrange-
ments, no major central bank at present usesderivatives as an instrument of monetary pol-icy. Nevertheless, the central bank could, intheory, use derivative contracts (such as for-ward rate agreements or options) to influencelonger-term interest rates. However temptingit might seem to use derivatives for that pur-pose, such operations would be fraught withenormous risks. It would mean the centralbank tying its own hands and committing it-

42self over an extended period to a given inter-
est rate path, which would be very costly toleave. In particular, adopting such a strategywould make it all but impossible to respondappropriately to future shocks. For that rea-son, interest rate derivatives have no place inthe set of monetary policy instruments. It isonly in extreme situations – such as in a per-sistent deflation – that a central bank mightfind it useful to be able to commit itself to aspecific interest rate path by using deriva-tives.
24
Even though derivatives are hardly suited tobe monetary policy instruments, the height-ened information efficiency of the market as-sociated with them can be used for monetarypolicy purposes. Derivatives prices providemany different kinds of data about marketplayers’ expectations. This information en-ables the central bank to form a more nu-anced judgement of the impact of monetarypolicy measures.
25As information is “priced
in” mainly on the futures market, futures arefundamentally better indicators than arebonds. The close arbitrage relationship be-tween the cash and futures markets ensuresthat identical information can be observed inboth market segments after only a few min-utes.
26In monetary policy practice, it is there-
fore irrelevant which market is being ana-lysed.
Stability of the financial systemPotential risks to the stability of the financial
system are primarily associated with OTC de-rivatives trading since it is concentrated on acomparatively small number of intermediarieswith a diverse presence in the various market
segments. As things stand at present, thereare no empirically corroborated findings onthe impact that the sudden collapse of amajor market maker can have on financialsystem stability. There are indications, how-ever, that the derivatives markets are suffi-ciently liquid to allow the unwinding of size-able positions without causing major disloca-tions. More problematical than the collapseof individual institutions, however, is a criticalsituation that affects several institutions atonce. The events of September and Oc-tober 1998 show that, under such circum-stances, the limits of the markets’ resiliencemay soon be reached.
27
In addition to its high degree of concentra-tion, the lack of transparency on the OTC de-rivatives market gives cause for concern. Theaccounting of many market players has notkept pace with innovation on the financialmarkets. In Germany, derivatives, as a rule,are shown on the balance sheet only upontheir maturity. Before that they are deemedto be uncompleted transactions, which donot appear on the balance sheet and arementioned, if at all, only in the notes on theannual accounts. In other countries, banks

43can show their derivatives activities on the
balance sheet, but the associated informationvalue is limited by the considerable scope fordiscretion that is available and by rights toopt for an alternative procedure.
28A further
difficulty in the accounting of OTC derivativesis the lack of an observable market price atwhich open positions can be valued. Whilethere are recognised pricing models for “plainvanilla” products, such as simple swaps oroptions, the valuation of complex derivativesis often hard to follow. For the reasons cited,it is difficult for outsiders to assess the finan-cial situation of the major players in the de-rivatives markets.
The sometimes very high degree of complex-
ity of OTC derivatives makes considerable de-mands on the market players. With newlyintroduced instruments, in particular, there isno guarantee that their risk profiles are reallyalways properly understood. For example,owing to errors, a number of major multi-national companies have suffered significantlosses when using derivatives.
29
The German banking supervisors reacted atan early stage to the increasing use of deriva-tives. Credit institutions have had to includederivatives in their reports to the Bundesbanksince as long ago as 1986. Since Oc-tober 1990, open positions in derivativeshave had to be backed by capital.
30Deriva-
tives are not treated fundamentally differentlyfrom other financial assets. In the case ofinterest rate derivatives, this is of particularrelevance to the capital requirements for mar-ket risks, which, since 1996, have applied tothe bank’s portfolio as a whole. This meansthat the market price risks of derivatives pos-
itions and the price risks of securities can beoffset against each other if they run in differ-ent directions. The use of derivatives forhedging purposes thus lowers the prudentialcapital requirements, while the incurrence ofadditional risks through derivatives increasesthem.
Closing remarks
The financial system has become far more
complex over the past few decades. Thegrowing number of financial instrumentsmeans that it is possible to split up risks intoever finer individual factors and trade them.The increased use of derivatives is a key fea-ture of this development. This may producechanges in the monetary policy transmissionprocess, although such changes have thus farstayed within narrow and manageablebounds. Overall, from the perspective of themonetary policymakers, this is likely to beoutweighed by the information advantages.Less easy to predict, by contrast, are the risksto the stability of the financial system result-ing from transactions being concentrated ona small number of banks, insurance com-panies and securities firms active in OTC de-

the lack of transparency in such trading.Clear, internationally harmonised accountingstandards are needed so that the players canmake a better assessment of their counter-party risks. The accounting of derivatives attheir “fair value” in accordance with IAS 39 isa step in that direction. In the interests of
greater transparency and valuation certainty,the available scope for discretion and rightsto opt for an alternative procedure in the ac-counting of derivatives should be reduced toan absolute minimum.

45The new “Minimum
requirements for thecredit business ofcredit institutions”and Basel IIIn September 2000 the Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision published its“Principles for the Management ofCredit Risk”, which identified concentra-tions of risk and weaknesses in lendinga n dl o a nm o n i t o r i n gp r o c e s s e si nc r e d i tinstitutions as the most frequent causesof problems in credit business. This is con-firmed by the recent difficulties beingfaced by individual credit institutions.
On 20 December 2002 the Federal Fi-
nancial Supervisory Authority, or FFSA(Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleis-tungsaufsicht, BaFin), published a setof “Minimum requirements for thecredit business of credit institutions”,
1
which define qualitative standards fororganising credit business.
The new international capital ad-
equacy requirements (Basel II), whichwill probably enter into effect at theend of 2006, likewise contain qualita-tive rules for the credit business ofthose institutions which use internalrating methods for measuring creditrisk. The “Minimum requirements”and the lending rules under Basel II arelargely congruent with one another.
Both sets of rules are ultimately de-
signed to contribute to the soundness ofcredit institutions and thus also to pro-moting the functional ability and thestability of the German banking system.

which were published back in October 1995and the “Minimum requirements for the in-ternal audit function of credit institutions”
3
published in January 2000.
The “Minimum requirements” mirror the best
practices of well-managed credit institutionsregarding the organisation of credit business.A key aim was to create a set of practical min-imum requirements that are also compatiblewith the limited resources available to smallerbanks.
The new “Minimum requirements” entered
into force with the publication of circular34/2002 (BA). At the same time, credit insti-tutions have been given until 30 June 2004 toimplement these requirements (first stage ofimplementation). Necessary adjustments inthe IT area have to be implemented in asecond step by 31 December 2005.
With its circular on the “Minimum require-
ments”, the FFSA has given concrete shape inrespect of credit business to the provisions of
section 25a (1) of the Banking Act, accordingto which credit institutions are subject to spe-cial requirements regarding a proper businessorganisation, risk controlling and the moni-toring of their banking business.
The “Minimum requirements” apply to all
credit institutions in Germany, includingbranches located abroad. They do not applyto branches of enterprises domiciled in an-other country of the European EconomicArea pursuant to section 53b of the BankingAct. In principle, all exposures within themeaning of section 19 (1) of the Banking Act(asset items and off-balance-sheet transac-tions entailing a counterparty risk) and alltransactions with country risk fall within thescope of application of this circular. The re-quirements of this circular apply by analogyto trading activities, in accordance with the“Minimum requirements for the trading ac-tivities of credit institutions”, as well as toparticipating interests. By selecting the ex-tended credit definition of section 19 (1), the“Minimum requirements” are consistent withthe definition of credit risk usually appliedinternationally for regulatory purposes.
Banking supervisors place special emphasis
on creating a proper credit risk environmentwithin which credit business activities can de-velop. Credit institutions are therefore re-quired to impose their own framework condi-tions for ensuring a proper and suitable or-

procedures to identify, manage and monitorcredit risk as well as to implement them in-ternally. The framework conditions are to bedefined for each specific institution andshould take account of each institution’s indi-vidual situation such as size, complexity, thefocus of its operations and its ability to sus-tain risk.
One example of such framework conditions is
the formulation of a credit risk strategy whichdefines lending activities over an adequateplanning period. This strategy should be for-mulated taking into account the institution’sability to bear risk, an analysis of the businesspolicy status quo and an estimate of the risksassociated with the credit business. Internalorganisational guidelines are another part ofthis framework. The “Minimum require-ments” list areas which expressly need to beregulated by the institution, such as
– the allocation of tasks, the assignment of
competencies and monitoring;
– the procedure for the timely risk assess-
ment of the exposures, also in respect ofany risk provisioning measures that mightbe necessary;
– risk classification procedures for assessing
counterparty risk and, as appropriate, ob-ject/project risk;
– procedures for the early identification,
management and monitoring of risks aris-ing from credit business; and– a procedure for the introduction of new
types of products and the commencementof business activities on new markets.
The framework conditions have to be re-
viewed annually and amended as appropri-ate; they have to be documented logicallyand communicated within the credit institu-tion.
By emphasising the overall responsibility of
management, the “Minimum requirements”make it clear that, despite the division ofmanagerial responsibilities prevalent intoday’s business world, all managers, regard-less of the internal assignment of competen-cies, are collectively responsible for ensuringthe orderly organisation of credit businessand the proper management and monitoringScope of application of the

pick up where the “Minimum requirementsfor the trading activities of credit institutions”and the “Minimum requirements for the in-ternal audit function of credit institutions”left off.
The requirements concerning sufficient quali-
fication of the staff who perform credit busi-ness relate not only to the staff active in lend-ing decisions but to all staff involved in thevarious processes of the credit business chain.Adequate professional qualifications of thepersons incurring, managing and monitoringthe risks are of key importance. These re-quirements should be met by the careful se-lection of staff and by means of employeetraining measures.
The rules governing the separation of func-
tions in credit business are a core element ofthe “Minimum requirements”. The key prin-ciple for organising the processes in creditbusiness is the clear separation of the “frontoffice” and “back office” functions, with theformer defined as the area which initiatestransactions. The separation of the two func-tions is to be observed all the way up to andincluding management level and also at dep-uty level (for exceptions see the section “Sim-plified rules” below).
The credit risk controlling function, which is
responsible for independently monitoringportfolio risks and filing reports, is to be exer-cised by a unit not affiliated with the front of-fice. The same applies to the units responsiblefor the development and quality of creditbusiness processes and for the development,quality and monitoring of the implementation
of risk classification procedures.
The involvement in the credit decision of a
unit independent of the initiators of thetransaction is a key element of the rules gov-erning the separation of functions. The estab-lishment of a credit risk controlling unit notaffiliated with the front office is designed toincrease the transparency of credit decisionsand their effects and thereby to eliminateweaknesses in the identification of credit riskand in credit risk management which in somecases still exist.
Another key requirement, in keeping with the
separation of the front office and back officefunctions, is that each credit decision necessi-tates a vote by a unit independent of thefront office as well as by the front office. Thevote of the back office is the deciding factor.This should also be reflected in the assign-ment of competencies and, in the case of asplit vote, the subsequent escalation proced-ure (referral of the decision to the next higherlevel). The thinking behind the introductionof a two-vote rule was again to enhance thetransparency of the credit transaction pro-cesses.
A different situation applies where one man-
ager of an institution takes a credit decisionwithin the defined scope of his individualdecision-making authority. In that case thevotes of the front office and back office maydeviate from the manager’s credit decision.These decisions, however, should be madetransparent in the risk report.

49For lending decisions relating to certain types
of business or for lending transactions belowcertain thresholds which are to be definedunder risk aspects (low-risk transactions),management may decide that only one voteis necessary. To that extent the organisationalseparation between front office and back of-fice is only relevant to credit transactions inwhich the risk involved makes two votes ne-cessary.
Banks need to develop internal procedures
for classifying their credit positions by riski-ness. It is up to the banks to determine theprecise design of their risk classification pro-cedures. Meaningful and logical risk classifi-cation procedures for the initial, regular or adhoc assessment of counterparty risk and, asappropriate, object/project risk must be es-tablished.
In addition, credit institutions have to set up
early warning procedures which detect anydeterioration in a borrower’s creditworthinessat an early stage and enable the credit institu-tion to take timely suitable measures to dealwith the exposures in question. Such earlywarning procedures might include, for in-stance, the ongoing monitoring of current ac-counts. If, for example, a borrower’s incomingpayments deviate sharply from the usualchronological pattern, this would be an earlywarning indicator. Early warning proceduresand risk classification procedures may be inte-grated in an overall risk system.
On the basis of the risk classification proced-
ure, banks need to implement procedures toidentify, manage and monitor credit risk. Aspart of the requested procedures, the “Min-
imum requirements” additionally prescribe aregular (at least quarterly) risk report. Man-agement must then forward the report to thesupervisory board. Regulators attach greatimportance to this report because, without ameaningful internal reporting procedure,management cannot assume its overall re-sponsibility for the institution, especially forassessing the risk situation. The risk reportshould inter alia comment on the develop-
ment of the loan portfolio, the volume andtrend of new business, the development ofrisk provisioning or important credit decisionswhich deviate from the credit risk strategy.
Minimum requirements for internal
rating systems under Basel II
The new Basel Capital Accord introduces
qualitative and quantitative minimum require-ments for banks’ internal rating systemswhere these are required for measuring regu-latory capital. Two internal ratings-based ap-proaches (IRB approaches) exist, each ofwhich requires approval. In addition, there isa regulatory Basel standardised approach formeasuring the necessary regulatory capitalfor those credit institutions which do not useinternal rating systems or whose internal rat-ing systems have not been approved by regu-lators.
If the IRB approaches are used, the probability
of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) andexposure at default (EAD), as well as the ma-turity, are estimated for every loan on thebasis of the ratings. The regulatory capital re-

50quirement is calculated from these risk par-
ameters and on the basis of a regulatory riskweighting function. The above table illus-trates the evolutionary character of the newBasel approaches to measuring credit risk.
To be approved by regulators, internal rating
systems need to meet the following basic cri-teria. These criteria, like the “Minimum re-quirements”, are geared closely to currentbest practices for rating systems in the bank-ing industry.
The goal of internal rating systems is to
achieve a meaningful differentiation of riskswithin the institution’s loan portfolio. Internalrating systems should also provide clues re-garding major risk drivers. Internal rating sys-tems must therefore analyse, in two separatedimensions, borrowers’ creditworthiness and
any collateral (two-dimensional rating sys-tem). In addition, internal rating systemsshould contain at least seven rating classesfor non-defaulted loans and at least one rat-ing class for defaulted borrowers. Rating sys-tems should assess all important credit risks,but specific risk factors are not prescribed indetail. This therefore gives credit institutionsextensive methodological leeway.
The rating process should ensure the objectiv-
ity and independence of the processes of as-signing credit ratings and monitoring the rat-ing system. In practice, this can be achievedeither by assigning the rating process to aunit independent of the initiators of transac-tions, or by fully automated and objective rat-ing systems which leave the customer ac-Credit risk measurement approaches under Basel II

51count staff no discretion to influence the rat-
ing result. The rating classification prescribedby the system can be changed at any time;however, changes must always be document-ed.
For methodological reasons it is additionally
necessary for every borrower in an IRB port-folio to have a rating, and thus a PD, which isneeded to calculate the required amount ofregulatory capital. A further key requirementis that all borrowers be re-rated at least oncea year to capture the current risk situation.
The corporate governance rules encompass
inter alia management’s overall responsibility
for the adequacy of rating systems and theircorrect use in internal borrower evaluationand risk management. Banks are also re-quired to allow internal and external auditorsto regularly audit the quality of rating systemsand the adequacy of their use.
If a bank has its own ratings, they must form
an integral part of its internal management.Examples range from ratings-based lendingdecisions, assignments of competencies, limitsystems and risk provisioning measures tocredit risk-dependent remuneration systems.Rating systems conceived merely for regula-tory purposes which are not simultaneouslybeing used for internal risk management willnot be approved.
The internal use of ratings is of key import-
ance from a regulatory perspective. For onething, it helps to improve internal risk man-agement, thus promoting the stability of thebanking industry. For another, credit institu-tions, by using these ratings in their lending
decisions, have a vested interest in the ratingassessments being adequate and in the at-tendant intensive internal monitoring. The in-ternal use of ratings for credit risk manage-ment thus also contributes to ensuring theadequacy of PD, LGD and EAD as risk param-eters.
To obtain a comprehensive picture of the risk
situation in credit business, internal stresstests based on ratings must be performed.The idea is to use these stress tests to helpbanks better understand the impact of nega-tive conjunctural influences on their loanportfolios and to take the relevant precau-tionary measures on that basis.
Banks are required to use the uniform regula-
tory definition of default shown in the box onpage 52 for quantifying the risk parametersPD, LGD and EAD. The uniformity of the def-inition of default is intended to ensure thecomparability of the internally measured riskparameters. This uniformity is significant bothfor regulatory and for competitive reasons.
The forecast PD, LGD and EAD should, in
addition, be calculated based on each banks’own internal loss history to ensure the ad-equacy of the risk parameters for that creditinstitution’s specific portfolio and the ratingsystem being used. If the bank’s own loss his-tory is not sufficient to estimate statistically

In order to allow the risk-mitigating effect ofthe financial and physical collateral recog-nised in the IRB foundation approach to beincluded in the calculation of the capitalcharge via regulatory LGD, banks must dem-onstrate that the collateral they have collect-ed is of lasting value (eg by producing expertopinions to that effect). In addition, thebank’s internal collateral management systemmust ensure the legal enforceability and aregular realistic valuation of the collateral.
Credit institutions which wish to use one of
the IRB approaches must review the adequacyof their rating systems and risk parameters atleast once a year. The banks will test the abil-ity of rating systems to discriminate betweenhigh-quality and low-quality borrowers – ifonly out of self-interest. From a regulatoryperspective, however, the absolute level ofPD, LGD and EAD is even more importantsince they determine the amount of regula-tory capital.
Only one empirical default rate can be calcu-
lated per rating class per year – as the quo-Basel definition of default
A default is considered to have occurred with
regard to a particular obligor when either orboth of the two following events has takenplace.
– The bank considers that the obligor is un-
likely to pay its credit obligations to thebanking group in full, without recourse bythe bank to actions such as realising secur-ity (if held).
– The obligor is past due more than 90 days
on any material credit obligation to thebanking group. Overdrafts will be con-sidered as being past due once the cus-tomer has breached an advised limit orbeen advised of a limit smaller than currentoutstandings.
The elements to be taken as indications of un-
likeliness to pay include:
– The bank puts the credit obligation on
non-accrued status.
– The bank makes a charge-off or account-
specific provision resulting from a signifi-cant perceived decline in credit quality sub-sequent to the bank taking on the expos-ure.
– The bank sells the credit obligation at a
material credit-related economic loss.
– The bank consents to a distressed restruc-
turing of the credit obligation where this islikely to result in a diminished financial ob-ligation caused by the material forgive-ness, or postponement, of principal, inter-est or (where relevant) fees.
– The bank has filed for the obligor’s bank-
ruptcy or a similar order in respect of theobligor’s credit obligation to the bankinggroup.
– The obligor has sought or been placed in
bankruptcy or similar protection wherethis would avoid or delay repayment of thecredit obligation to the banking group.
Deutsche Bundesbank4This may be the case, for instance, if no defaults exist in
the very good rating classes or even in entire portfolios,
or if smaller banks generally do not have enough defaults
per year and rating class for statistical analyses.
5In this connection, pooled data refer to the estimation
of PD by pooling the loss histories of several credit institu-
tions which use comparable internal rating systems. The
internal data form at least part of the data pool used for
the estimates. By contrast, external data denote a default
data pool containing no data from the credit institution
whatsoever. A textbook example of the latter is the map-
ping of internal ratings to the rating scales of external
rating agencies such as Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s and
the use of their default rates.Recognition

53tient of the number of borrowers defaulting
in the year in question divided by all borrow-ers in the rating class. Statistical tests whichcompare the forecast PDs to the actually ob-served annual default rates will probably haveonly limited informative value owing to theshort empirical time series. Notwithstandingthis, the Basel Committee is still working onthe development of further prudential valid-ation methods. However, even under the al-ready proposed rules banks should still reviewtheir forecast PDs using annual default ratesand adjust their forecasts for the future asappropriate.
Under Basel II, credit institutions seeking to
qualify for one of the IRB approaches mustdisclose aggregated risk information (eg fore-cast and actual PD, LGD and EAD per ratingclass) in their annual accounts. These datacan be used by market participants to obtaina clearer picture of the institutions’ risk struc-ture. However, information which wouldmake it possible to infer information aboutindividual borrowers and would therefore beproblematic in terms of data protection maynot be published.
The prudential character of the
“Minimum requirements” andthe IRB approaches under Basel II
The implementation of both the “Minimum
requirements” and Basel II will improve creditinstitutions’ credit risk management. Never-theless, the “Minimum requirements” andthe IRB approaches are fundamentally differ-ent in terms of their prudential character.Whereas the “Minimum requirements” pre-
scribe qualitative minimum requirements forthe credit business of all credit institutions,the qualitative and quantitative minimum re-quirements of the IRB approaches are manda-tory only for those institutions which havechosen to apply IRB approaches. The IRB ap-proaches represent a further-reaching com-plement to a selected aspect of the “Min-imum requirements” – the risk classificationprocedure.
For a bank to be able to use one of the two
IRB approaches to calculate its regulatory cap-ital, it has to submit an application for super-visory review followed by an explicit approvalby supervisors. In contrast, the “Minimum re-quirements”, as best practices, are regularlymonitored at all credit institutions in thecourse of ongoing banking supervision. Therelationship between the “Minimum require-ments” and the IRB approaches is in many re-spects similar to the relationship between the“Minimum requirements for the trading ac-tivities of credit institutions” and banks’ in-ternal models for calculating the capitalcharge for market risk in line with the BaselMarket Risk Paper of 1997. Both the “Min-imum requirements for the trading activitiesof credit institutions” and the “Minimum re-quirements for the credit business of credit in-stitutions” provide the necessary organisa-tional basis for the correct use of internalmodels and procedures.

ments for the trading activities of credit insti-tutions” and the “Minimum requirements forthe credit business of credit institutions”, as

models and rating systems, will all merge intothe Supervisory Review Process (SRP) fromthe end of 2006. However, the initial reviewof a market risk model or an internal ratingsystem within the SRP will continue to betantamount to an eligibility test, a test that isconducted only at the request of the creditinstitution.
The standardised approach is to be applied
until approval to use internal rating systemsfor determining regulatory capital is grantedor if approval is refused. This means that par-allels between the respective standardised ap-proaches for market and credit risk, on theone hand, and alternative internal methods,on the other, can also be seen in respect ofthe supervisory procedure.Common features shared by the “Min-
imum requirements” and IRB approaches
The “Minimum requirements” concentrate
on principles of the functional and organisa-tional structure and the shaping of creditbusiness processes. The IRB approaches ofBasel II, by contrast, exclusively address theissue of risk quantification and the attendantcalculation of regulatory capital. They thusfocus primarily on a specific sub-sector of the“Minimum requirements” – the risk classifica-tion procedure.
However, some aspects of the “Minimum re-
quirements” play a role in ensuring that rat-ings obtained using IRB approaches are cor-rect. Certain general minimum requirementsRegulatory character of general minimum requirements and of

55may be interpreted as a “side condition” of
the IRB approaches.
The separation of functions required by the
“Minimum requirements” is rather similar tothe independence of the rating assignment inthe IRB approaches. Parallels similarly exist be-tween the independent monitoring of ratingsystems under Basel II and the fact that re-sponsibility for the development, quality andmonitoring of the application of risk classifi-cation procedures is to be independent of thefront office according to the “Minimum re-quirements”.
There is a notable link between the Basel re-
quirement that ratings be used for internalcredit risk management and the provisions ofthe “Minimum requirements” with respect tothe identification and management of risk,
the assignment of competencies, credit riskstrategy, risk provisioning and the structure ofthe terms and conditions. All these provisionsof the “Minimum requirements” should bebased on the risk information provided by in-ternal rating systems in the case of banksusing IRB approaches.
The exemptions for low-risk credit business
expressed in the “Minimum requirements”are contained in a different form in the IRBapproaches. For retail banking, a typicalexample of low-risk business, banks arepermitted to use rating methods which aresimpler, standardised, more automated andthus more cost-effective. They are oftencalled “scorings” or “score cards” in practice.It is nevertheless necessary to assess the riskStandardised approaches versus internal models

56for the individual borrowers in a standardised
manner since less risky business, too, needsto be backed by capital. For this, within theIRB approaches it is necessary to differentiateby risk and to estimate PD, LGD and EAD.
General process, organisation and monitoring
requirements, such as the overall responsibil-ity of management, regular reviews by the in-ternal audit function and external auditors,and requirements for staff qualifications arenearly identical in both sets of rules. In eachcase the rules require the responsible units tobe familiar with the internally defined frame-work conditions and risk measurementmethods, to be able to adequately implementand monitor them, and to have the necessaryqualifications.
Specific requirements for internal rating
systems
In the area of risk classification, the minimum
requirements for IRB systems are far more ex-tensive than those contained in the “Min-imum requirements”. Unlike the IRB ap-proaches, the “Minimum requirements” donot require the quantification of risk by esti-mating PD and, as appropriate, LGD andEAD. There is neither a prudential definitionof default nor a minimum number of ratingclasses. The risk classification procedure,which complies with the “Minimum require-ments”, does not have to be quantitativelyvalidated, either.
An internal rating conforming to Basel II is to
be considered a special case in respect of therisk classification procedures stipulated in the“Minimum requirements”; all Basel II ratings
will comply with the “Minimum require-ments” in respect of risk classification proced-ures. The reverse does not apply, though; the“Minimum requirements” can be met usingmuch simpler procedures than for ratingsconforming to Basel II. The bar must be sethigher for internal rating systems than for the“Minimum requirements” because the for-mer apply only to selected banks which vol-untarily choose to pursue one of the IRB ap-proaches whereas the “Minimum require-ments” apply to all banks.
However, for those banks which choose to
use one of the IRB approaches, practical con-siderations make it appear wise to implementthe risk classification procedures of the “Min-imum requirements” in such a manner as toalready meet the key Basel II requirements.
“Minimum requirements” not directly
related to Basel II
Unlike the “Minimum requirements”, the
new Basel Capital Accord does not primarilycontain specific requirements for certain in-ternal processes such as the following.
– Internal definition of the credit risk strat-
egy and organisational guidelines for theconduct of credit business. Parts of the or-ganisational guidelines refer to the alloca-tion of tasks and the assignment of com-petencies, the structure of the processesand risk classification procedures and tothe reporting procedure.

In these areas the “Minimum requirements”exceed the minimum requirements for intern-al ratings (for an illustration of all interde-pendencies between the “Minimum require-ments” and the IRB approaches see the charton this page).
In addition, the “Minimum requirements” are
more differentiated than the Basel standard-ised approach in the area of risk classification.The standardised approach does not requireany classification of loans using a risk classifi-cation method; only externally rated loansneed to be backed by capital in a differenti-ated manner commensurate with the exter-nal rating.

The Foundation’s aim is topromote basic research in the fields ofeconomics and law with a view to se-curing monetary stability and stable fi-nancial systems. To this end researchfacilities affiliated to a university are tobe set up. A total of 551 million is avail-
able for this purpose in the form ofthe Foundation’s endowment capital,which was raised by the issue of a com-memorative DM 1 gold coin from theBundesbank’s monetary reserves. Thesubject of the conference was “An in-stitutional framework for monetarystability” (see also the conference pro-gramme on page 61). The choice ofthis subject was intended to under-score the importance of defining theright institutional framework. This hasbeen demonstrated very clearly in re-cent years by economic theory, particu-larly in the field of monetary policy.Prominent representatives of inter-national organisations, central banks,commercial banks, regulatory bodiesand the academic world took part inthe discussion.

60An institutional framework for
monetary stability
The first session of the conference established
the framework for the subsequent discussion.The defined objective was to answer the fol-lowing questions. What do we mean by pricestability and a stable financial system? Whyare these goals important in an economy?How do these goals relate to one another?There is now a general consensus that mon-etary stability is a key basis for the welfare ofa country or currency area. There was alsobroad agreement that an inflation rate ofunder 2% is compatible with monetary stabil-ity. Monetary stability relates to the overallprice level, not to individual prices. Relativeprices must be able to change if they are tofulfil their steering function. By contrast, eco-nomic theorists still find it hard to come upwith a simple and concise definition for thestability of the financial system. It is clear,however, that stability should not be con-fused with rigidity. On the contrary, the abilityto adjust to new circumstances is a key fea-ture of any system that promises lasting sta-bility. In this context the conference partici-pants also considered the interrelationshipbetween efficiency, competition and stability.
In recent years financial systems worldwide
have been confronted with crises more thanin the first few decades after the SecondWorld War – despite the marked progressthat has been made in combating inflation.Nevertheless, the dominant view at the con-ference was that safeguarding monetary sta-bility is the best contribution that centralbanks can make to avoiding financial crises.This is the most direct way in which monetary
policy can help ensure transparency and effi-ciency in the financial system. This does notrule out short-term disruptions and exagger-ations in the financial markets, however. Inthis context the participants also discussed towhat extent central banks can integrate earlywarning systems into their strategies to de-tect such dangers. In particular, it was point-ed out that the growth of monetary aggre-gates and bank lending may serve as an indi-cator of unhealthy developments. Financialmarket bubbles are often accompanied by asteep rise in bank liabilities and bank claims.This opens up an additional perspectivewhich may also be of interest in the discus-sion on the first pillar of the ECB’s monetarypolicy strategy.
After initially defining the goals in detail, the
conference then addressed the question ofwhat institutional framework is best suited torealising these aims. The debate focused atfirst on monetary stability. In this respect theprecise formulation of central banking legisla-tion is of key importance. Germany’s positiveexperience of an independent central bank,which had a particularly successful track re-cord in the field of stability policy, and theacademic debate going back more than adecade jointly paved the way to today’s situ-ation in which central banks the world overenjoy greater autonomy than used to be thecase. This went hand in hand with two otherdevelopments: the commitment of centralbanks to enhanced transparency and theirgreater public accountability.

62Although it appears uncontested that the
amendments to central bank statutes playedan important role in the stability policy suc-cess of the recent past, speakers at the con-ference underscored that this was not anautomatic process. Not least the history ofthe Federal Reserve System and the DeutscheBundesbank clearly shows that public sup-port, as well as skill and resilience on the partof the policy makers at the central banks,have been major factors in their success.
Central bank laws define the available scope
of monetary policy action in the narrowersense. But other institutional conditions, too,need to be examined. Two further areas werediscussed during the conference, namely la-bour markets and fiscal policy. The relation-ship between monetary policy and the institu-tional setting on the labour markets appearscomplex. In the run-up to European monetaryunion, for example, some people speculatedthat the single monetary policy in Europemight change the way labour markets in theeuro area are organised and function. On bal-ance, however, such influences seem to havebeen very limited so far. On the other hand,labour market rigidities that often stem frominstitutional factors may increase the costs ofa stability policy. In some cases this may leadto greater political pressure on central banks.
The discussion on the interrelationship be-
tween monetary and fiscal policy focused onthe pros and cons of the European Stabilityand Growth Pact. EC Commissioner PedroSolbes and Federal Finance Minister HansEichel stressed the Pact’s importance for thesmooth functioning of EMU. This does notpreclude improvements in the Pact’s imple-
mentation. Mr Solbes specifically called forgreater attention to be paid in future to en-suring that the principles of a responsible me-dium-term fiscal policy are also taken to heartduring economic upswings. This demandsgreater fiscal policy restraint whenever thelevel of business activity is above average.Critics of the Pact, by contrast, cited two prin-cipal dangers. They argued, firstly, that thePact prevents due account from being takenof the different requirements in the individualeuro-area economies and, secondly, that it di-verts attention from the real challenges thatEurope’s countries will face in the future. Inparticular, the Pact’s critics claim, it is more ur-gent to lower the general government spend-ing ratios than just to reduce the general gov-ernment deficits.
Whereas price stability was at the centre of
discussion during the first part of the confer-ence, the focus later turned to the questionof what precautionary measures are mostconducive to minimising the danger of finan-cial market crises. The intellectual challengesin this field now appear just as great as in thediscussion on safeguarding price stability. Be-sides the difficulty of defining financial mar-ket stability, there is at the moment no gener-ally agreed and closed model for determiningwhat instruments and approaches are bestsuited to predicting or preventing crises. Theongoing development of the financial sys-tems and the intensified competition which,though important for efficiency, can also poserisks to stability, are additional challengeswhich call for new approaches to prudential

63supervision. Nonetheless, there is evidently
agreement about some basic principles.
For example, various speakers emphasised
that transparency plays a key role in modernsystems of financial market supervision bypromoting responsibility and facilitating, forinstance, functioning early warning systems.The concrete design of accounting standardscould force firms inter alia to adopt a moreopen disclosure practice, which in turn wouldhelp to safeguard the stability of a given fi-nancial system. Most participants took theview that attempts to regulate the market dir-ectly are only of limited usefulness in a con-stantly changing world. This is often associ-ated with a tendency towards harmonisationwhich fails to address the differing individualneeds and hence may impair efficiency. Thesemisgivings about overregulation were high-lighted by examples from the financial sys-tem.
Another issue examined during the confer-
ence was how the supervision of financial sys-tems can best be organised. The discussionfocused on conditions in Europe. There was abroad consensus that even in a monetaryunion supervision should remain a nationalresponsibility, although a close exchange ofinformation is necessary between these na-tional authorities. There was likewise a largemeasure of agreement that central banksshould be integrated into the supervision offinancial systems; for a number of reasons
central banks are especially suited to contrib-uting to the stability of the overall system. Inthis context the German solution, underwhich the Federal Financial Supervisory Au-thority collaborates with the Bundesbank inthe field of prudential supervision in an effi-cient and economical partnership, was alsodiscussed extensively.
Finally, the conference also considered the
best way of tackling international financialcrises. Resolving this issue has acquired majorsignificance given the huge growth in inter-national capital flows of private-sector credit-ors. For example, the IMF has proposed a“Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism”.It was also pointed out, however, that all suchapproaches require broad support if they areto be successfully implemented.
The conference showed that a number of
questions remain unresolved, particularly inrespect of creating an efficient and stable fi-nancial system. In other areas, such as gain-ing acceptance for the goal of monetary sta-bility, a greater degree of unity and certaintyprevails today. But in this field, too, it is al-ready apparent that the future will bring newchallenges. Against this background the newFoundation’s objective of studying and pro-moting the conditions for stable prices and asound financial system seems well chosen.

*These euro area retail bank interest rates should be used with caution and Member States. Furthermore, the national interest rates are not harmonised
for statistical purposes only, primarily to analyse their development over in terms of their coverage (new business and/or outstanding amounts), th e
time rather than their level. They are calculated as the weighted average of nature of the data (nominal or effective) or the compilation method. The
national interest rates provided by the national central banks. The national country weights for the euro area retail bank interest rates are derived from
rates represent those rates that are currently available from national MFI balance sheet statistics or close proxies. The weights reflect thesources and which are judged to fit the standard categories. These national country-specific proportions of the relevant instruments within the eur o
rates have been aggregated to derive information for the euro area, in area, measured as outstanding amounts. The weights are adjusted monthly,some cases relying on proxies and working assumptions due to the so that interest rates and weights always refer to the same month. —1En-
