5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Underlying trends
The German economy stabilised further in
the third quarter of 2009. According to the
leading indicators, output is even expected to
pick up noticeably in the third quarter follow-
ing a slight increase in real gross domestic
product (GDP) in the previous quarter. The
current upturn, starting from a very low level,
is due mainly to the fact that confidence lost
in the wake of the Lehman insolvency is grad-
ually returning. Added to this are the large-
scale economic stimulus programmes adopt-
ed in the industrialised countries and in some
emerging market economies. These, along
with an expansionary monetary policy, are
starting to have a noticeable impact. German
enterprises are benefiting from the fact that
the incipient recovery in the world economy
is also giving a boost to exports. Demand
stimuli from abroad are providing a welcome
compensation for the waning effects of the
environmental premium for scrapping old
cars, which was a special factor that bolstered
private consumption in the first half of 2009.
Setbacks in the ongoing economic stabilisa-
tion process cannot be ruled out, however,
especially as risks to the economy are still em-
anating from the financial sector.
Industry
Seasonally adjusted industrial output in July
fell by 0.5% on the month. The decline is
likely to have been due primarily to the fact
that output in the reporting period was
dampened by a greater number of publicEconomic

6holidays than in previous years. If this effect is
excluded, the tendency towards stabilisation
in industrial activity continued at the begin-
ning of the third quarter. Industrial output in
July was up by a seasonally adjusted 11/C254%o n
the average of the second quarter. Manufac-
turers of intermediate goods performed fairly
well, while producers of capital goods, which
also includes vehicle manufacturers, suffered
further losses. Experience has shown that
holiday-related delays in production are a
major factor in this connection.
Following the recovery in the previous
months, July saw a marked seasonally adjust-
ed 2.9% decline in domestic sales of indus-
trial goods. This was due, not least, to the
way in which the holidays fell. Turnover in
capital goods was affected very strongly by
this. By contrast, German industrial exports
showed marked growth at the beginning of
the third quarter, too. The value of exports of
goods in July went up by a seasonally adjust-
ed 2.3% on the month even after a sharp rise
in June. Imports of goods were only slightly
up on the month in the reporting period. This
meant that the foreign trade surplus increased
to3121/C252billion in seasonally adjusted terms.
New industrial orders rose by a seasonally ad-
justed 3.5% on the month at the beginning
of the third quarter after rising quite sharply
in May and June. The increase in the report-
ing period was due to one very large arma-
ments order, however. Although seasonally
adjusted export demand for industrial goods
was somewhat lower in July, export orders
were 31/C252% up on the quarter. Domestic
orders, too, showed a significant rise on theEconomic conditions in Germany*

7second quarter, even if the aforementioned
major order is not taken into account. The in-crease in the intermediate goods sector wasespecially important in this context. Therewas also a further seasonally adjusted in-crease in domestic orders of machinery inJuly, whereas demand for motor vehicles fellback from the higher level recorded in theprevious months. All in all, there was a pick-up in demand in all major sectors of Germanindustry over the past few months.
ConstructionConstruction output in July fell by 2.3% on
the month in seasonally adjusted terms afterhaving already declined in May and June.Holiday effects are also likely to have played apart in this at the end of the period underreview. Construction demand in the secondquarter – more recent data are unavailable atpresent – went up by a seasonally adjusted5.1% on the quarter. All sectors, especiallyresidential and road construction, benefitedfrom the stimuli this generated.
Labour marketThe strain on the labour market brought
about by the economic crisis is gradually in-creasing. According to initial calculations bythe Federal Statistical Office, the seasonallyadjusted number of persons in work in Julyfell by 15,000 on the month to 40.18 million.The year-on-year decline widened to144,000. Following sharp declines in Apriland May, the number of employees subject tosocial security contributions in June showedonly a slight decrease according to the provi-sional data. Estimates by the Federal Employ-
ment Agency indicate that, in the secondquarter, 1.4 million employees were receivingshort-time working benefits due to economicfactors. Although there was a further fall inthe number of new registrations for short-time work from 170,000 in July to around105,000 in August, the actual number ofshort-time working hours is likely to remainat a high level. The leading indicators suggestthat the decline in employment will continue.The BA-X index was stagnating at a low level.There was an improvement in the Ifo employ-ment barometer for trade and industry, but itwas still in contractionary territory.
The official unemployment figure in August,
at a seasonally adjusted 3.48 million, was justas high as in the previous month. However,according to estimates by the Federal Employ-ment Agency, without the revisions to the la-bour market statistics, this figure would haverisen by around 25,000 persons in seasonallyadjusted terms, compared with an increaseof 14,000 in July. The unemployment figureshowed a year-on-year increase of 276,000in August. The unemployment rate, at 8.3%,was 0.7 percentage point up on the year.
PricesCrude oil prices in August remained largely at
the level reached following the sharp rise inthe second half of July. At US$73 on amonthly average, the spot price for BrentNorth Sea oil was 11
1/C252% higher than in July.

8marked premiums; US$31/C254and US$71/C254were
being charged for six-month and 18-month
deliveries respectively. As this report went to
press, the spot price stood at US$72.
Price reductions at the upstream stages of the
economy continued in July. In seasonally ad-
justed terms, the cost of imports in July was
down 1.1% on the month and 12.6% on the
year. Producer prices for industrial products
were down 1.6% on the month and 7.8%
on the year. The sharp declines were due pri-
marily to crude oil prices, which declined per-
ceptibly for a time in the first half of July.
There were also price reductions for domestic
sales of intermediate goods. The prices of
capital and consumer goods showed little
change. The further rise in crude oil prices
was apparent at the domestic producer level
in August. Industrial producer prices went up
by a seasonally adjusted 0.7% on the month;
the year-on-year figure fell to -6.9%.
At a seasonally adjusted 0.5%, consumer
prices rose fairly sharply in August following a
crude oil price-induced decline in July. Con-
sumer prices of petrol and heating oil showed
a further marked rise and more than offset
the decline in the previous month. However,
a number of energy providers have lowered
their gas prices again. Greater price reduc-
tions than normal, especially in the case of
seasonal food products, formed a counter-
weight to the overall rise in energy prices.
The rise in the cost of clothing in connection
with the introduction of the autumn collec-
tion was more or less as sharp as in the previ-
ous year. The price trend for services was sub-
dued on the whole. Owing to the absence ofthe strong baseline effect, overall consumer
prices in August, according to the national
consumer price index, were again as high as
in the same period last year, compared with a
rate of -0.5% in July. According to the Har-
monised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the
year-on-year rate of inflation was -0.1%,
compared with -0.7% in the previous month.
Public finances1
Statutory health insurance scheme
In the second quarter of 2009, the statutory
health insurance system (the health insurance
institutions and the health insurance fund
combined) recorded a surplus of just under
31/C254billion, which thus barely exceeded the
previous year’s figure. Transfers from central
government were slightly higher than in the
second quarter of 2008.2Revenue and ex-
penditure both increased by a total of just
under 51/C252%. Additional revenue, which was
generated primarily by the higher contribu-
tion rate until mid-year (15.5% compared
with the previous average rate of 14.9%),
was offset by a similar amount of additional
1In the short commentaries on public finances the em-
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the
Monthly Reports (published in February, May, August and
November), by contrast, contain a detailed description of
the development of public finances during the preceding
quarter. For detailed data on budgetary developments
and public debt, see the statistical section.
2Until 2008, the Federal grant was transferred in two
tranches in the second and final quarters ( 32.5 billion in
total last year). Now, these tranches, which have been in-
creased to a total of 34 billion, are paid in regular month-
ly instalments. However, to safeguard the health insur-
ance fund’s ability to meet its ongoing payment obliga-
tions vis-/C224-vis the health insurance institutions, additional
advance payments were made primarily in the first quar-
ter, in which contribution receipts were relatively low.Import and

9expenditure. After adjustment for this rate
rise, contribution receipts grew by just under1%. The unfavourable macroeconomic trendhad only a muted effect on revenue to thestatutory health insurance scheme as con-tributions for pensioners and recipients ofwage substitutes (in particular, unemploy-ment benefit I and short-time working bene-fits) had a stabilising effect.
The sharp first-quarter rise in spending on
benefits continued practically unabated. Themain factors driving up expenditure wereincreases in spending on out-patient treat-ment resulting from the new remuneration ar-rangements (+6% on the year) and in-patienttreatment in hospitals (+5
1/C252%); pursuant to
the Hospital Financing Reform Act ( Kranken-
hausfinanzierungsreformgesetz ), hospitals may
pass through half of the costs associated withthe rises in negotiated rates of pay introducedin 2008 and 2009 to the health insurance insti-tutions. However, growth in other expenseswas also still significantly stronger overall than,for example, insured persons’ income subjectto contributions, leading to pressure for a risein the contribution rate or the Federal grants.
In the first six months of 2009 as a whole, the
surplus for the statutory health insurance sys-tem came to 31
1/C254billion. However, this clear
improvement on the previous year’s deficit ofjust under 31 billion is due entirely to pay-
ments from central government, which were32
1/C252billion higher in the first half of 2009
than a year previously.
In the statutory health insurance system, the
health insurance fund, which collects thecontributions and Federal grants, must pay
predetermined equal monthly instalmentsto the health insurance institutions. Conse-quently, not only the risk of estimation errorsregarding revenue developments but also theliquidity risk during the year are carried by thefund or – given the fund’s current absence ofreserves – by central government, which pro-vided the fund with liquidity assistance forthis reason at the beginning of 2009. Thesepayment flows between central governmentand the health insurance fund will be re-versed at the end of 2009 owing to the factthat contribution receipts are usually higherat that time of year.
Owing to the typical increase in healthcare
expenditure towards the end of the year, def-icits can certainly be expected in the secondFinances of the statutory

10half of the year for the health institutions,
whose receipts are now distributed more
evenly throughout the year. Whether the
statutory health insurance institutions record
a surplus or a deficit for 2009 as a whole fol-
lowing the positive balance of the first six
months depends entirely on whether their
actual expenditure is greater or smaller than
estimated at the end of 2008 and thus differs
in size from the predetermined receipts from
the health insurance fund. To date, the sharp
increase in the health insurance institutions’
spending has remained within expectations.
Even taking account of the additional costs
for influenza vaccinations, the resources re-
ceived from the fund should therefore be
more or less sufficient, meaning that individ-
ual health insurance institutions are highly
unlikely to demand additional contributionsof insurees this year. This situation is likely to
change next year as the uniform contribution
rate will be raised only if the expenditure
cover provided by payments from the health
insurance fund is in danger of falling below
the threshold of 95% stipulated by law.
Owing to the weak macroeconomic environ-
ment, the fund’s contribution receipts for
2009 as a whole will be lower than expected
and will probably be insufficient to cover its
payment obligations to the health insurance
institutions. To offset such a shortfall, the
Federal budget envisages an appropriation
authorisation for a loan of 34 billion, al-
though only a small part of this sum is likely
to be required. These funds must be paid
back by the end of 2011.
As part of the second economic stimulus
package, the uniform contribution rate was
lowered from 15.5% to 14.9% in mid-2009.
The fund’s revenue shortfalls of just over 33
billion in the second half of the year will
be offset by additional central government
funds. A further extraordinary increase of 33
billion is envisaged for the coming year in
order to compensate for the losses in contri-
bution receipts over the year as a whole. As
previously planned, the Federal grant is to be
additionally raised by 31.5 billion per year
and is set to reach the target value of 314 bil-
lion, originally foreseen for 2016, as early as
2012.

11surplus of 31/C254billion after recording a margin-
al deficit a year earlier. At 15%, revenue
growth was again very strong as the contri-
bution rate was raised from 1.7% to 1.95%
(plus a special contribution of 0.25% to be
paid by childless persons in both cases) on
1 July 2008. After adjustment for the rate in-
crease, contribution receipts were up by1/C252%.
As in the statutory health insurance scheme,
the negative impact of the unfavourable
macroeconomic situation is being cushioned
by contributions for pensioners and recipients
of wage substitutes. At almost 6%, growth in
expenditure remained at the high first-
quarter level. This reflects the extension of
benefits introduced as part of the nursing
care reform. Reserves amounted to just over
34 billion at the end of June.
The surplus reached almost 31/C252billion in the
first half of the year and is likely to expand
further over the year as a whole. As neither
further contribution rate increases nor benefit
extensions are planned before the end of the
year, more favourable budget balances can
be expected in the second half of the year fol-
lowing the usual seasonal pattern. The nega-
tive employment effect on revenue will prob-
ably continue to be mitigated by the fact that
the rise in unemployment is still focused at
the insurance level (unemployment benefit I)
and that comparatively high contributions are
therefore being paid. This could change in
the coming year. In addition, a further in-
crease in the long-term care benefit rates is
planned as of 1 January 2010. The surplus in
the long-term care insurance scheme is thus,
in all likelihood, a temporary phenomenon.Securities markets
Bond market
The issuance volume in the German bond
market fell markedly month on month in July
2009, with gross sales amounting to 3112.6
billion compared with 3145.0 billion in June.
After deducting redemptions, which also
decreased, and taking account of changes in
issuers’ holdings of their own bonds, the
volume of outstanding domestic bonds de-
creased by 313.5 billion. Foreign debt secur-
ities with a total value of 310.2 billion were
concurrently sold on the German market;
this consisted almost exclusively of euro-
denominated securities. On balance, there-
fore, 33.3 billion was returned to investors.
The public sector redeemed debt securities
worth a total of 39.8 billion net in the report-
ing month. Securities totalling 38.1 billion net
were returned to central government. This
notably included ten-year federal bonds
(Bunds) in the amount of 318.7 billion and, to
a lesser extent, 30-year Bunds ( 30.5 billion)
as well as Federal Treasury financing paper
(30.1 billion). By contrast, central government
continued to issue short-term securities in net
terms, in particular Treasury discount paper
(Bubills) with a maturity of up to 12 months
(39.4 billion) as well as two-year Federal
Treasury notes (Sch/C228tze) and five-year Federal
notes (Bobls) for 31.2 billion and 30.7 billion
respectively. The outstanding amount of debt
securities issued by state governments fell by

12Credit institutions reduced their capital mar-
ket borrowing in July by a further 35.4 billion
(after 37.7 billion in June). The largest repur-
chases, in net terms, concerned debt secur-
ities issued by specialised credit institutions
(32.9 billion) and public Pfandbriefe ( 32.4 bil-
lion), although the category of other bank
debt securities, which can be structured par-
ticularly flexibly, was also redeemed on balance
(31.8 billion). By contrast, mortgage Pfand-
briefe were sold to the value of 31.7 billion.
In July, German enterprises issued debt secur-
ities for 31.7 billion net, on balance exclusive-
ly in the form of bonds with original matur-
ities of more than one year.
The primary purchasers of debt securities on
the German bond market were domesticnon-banks ( 317.1 billion), buying, in the main,
foreign bonds ( 313.3 billion). Domestic credit
institutions added bonds worth 31.4 billion to
their portfolios on balance. By contrast, for-
eign investors sold a sizeable quantity of debt
securities ( 321.8 billion net).
Equity market
In the month under review, domestic enter-
prises issued 30.4 billion worth of new shares
in the German equity market, almost all of
which involved listed companies. The out-
standing volume of foreign shares in the Ger-
man market increased in July ( 32.5 billion).
Foreign investors were the main purchasers
of equities on the domestic stock markets
(34.9 billion). German non-banks also in-
creased their equity holdings by 31.8 billion,
whereas German credit institutions sold shares
totalling 33.9 billion net.
Mutual fund shares
Domestic mutual funds recorded inflows of
34.2 billion net in July, the majority of which
was channelled into specialised funds re-
served for institutional investors ( 33.4 billion).
Of the domestic funds open to the public, es-
pecially equity-based funds ( 31.1 billion) and
bond-based funds ( 30.9 billion) successfully
offloaded their shares as well as, albeit to a
lesser extent, mixed funds ( 30.3 billion) and
mixed securities funds ( 30.1 billion). Con-
versely, money market funds ( 31.2 billion)
and open-end real estate funds ( 30.4 billion)

Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur-
plus – in unadjusted terms – of 311.0 billion
in July 2009. The result was thus 32.5 billion
down on the level of the previous month. The
main reason for this was the reversal to a
negative balance in invisible current transac-
tions, which comprise services, income and
current transfers. By contrast, the trade sur-
plus went up.
According to provisional figures from the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, in July the foreign trade
surplus went up by 31.8 billion on the month
to313.9 billion. After adjustment for season-
al and calendar variations, it expanded by
31.5 billion to 312.4 billion. The value of ex-
ports rose by 2.3% while nominal imports re-
mained unchanged. Compared with the
second-quarter average, seasonally adjusted
nominal exports rose much more sharply
(+6.5%) than imports (+3.2%). In real terms,
the increase in imports was somewhat more
pronounced owing to lower prices, especially
for energy and other commodities.
A deficit of 31.7 billion was recorded for in-
visible current transactions in July, compared
with a surplus of 32.2 billion in June. This can
be attributed to a deterioration in all three
sub-accounts. The net deficit arising fromcurrent transfers rose by 32.6 billion to 32.7
billion. In addition, the deficit on services
went up by 30.9 billion to 33.3 billion as a re-
sult of increased expenditure on travel. Net
receipts from cross-border income decreased
from 34.7 billion to 34.3 billion.
Cross-border portfolio investment led to net
capital outflows in July. At 332.6 billion, these
were more than three times as high as in June
(39.2 billion). On the one hand, foreign port-
folio investors withdrew funds from Germany
(317.8 billion) after having invested 31.1 bil-
lion in domestic securities in the previous
month. In the main, they sold German debt
securities ( 321.8 billion). While disposing of
bonds ( 331.1 billion) they purchased money
market paper ( 39.3 billion). Furthermore,
they acquired shares worth 34.9 billion. On
the other hand, additional capital outflows
were generated by increased investment by
German investors abroad ( 314.7 billion, com-
pared with 310.4 billion before). Their pri-
mary focus was on foreign debt securities
(310.2 billion). In this context they acquired
bonds ( 37.6 billion) – especially those denom-
inated in euro – but they also invested in
money market paper ( 32.6 billion). Moreover,
they purchased mutual fund shares ( 33.0 bil-
lion) and shares ( 31.6 billion) abroad.
In July, net transactions in the area of direct
investment were broadly balanced (- 30.1 bil-
lion). With respect to foreign-owned German
enterprises there were modest capital out-
flows ( 31.4 billion). These were primarily at-
tributable to intra-group lending – and, in
particular, to short-term financial loans – be-
tween foreign parent companies and theirCurrent

14domestic affiliates. Conversely, in net terms,
German enterprises also withdrew funds
from abroad ( 31.3 billion). A major role was
played by loans between affiliated enterprises
(35.5 billion). Among other activities, domes-
tic parent companies availed themselves of
long-term loans from their affiliates domiciled
abroad. At the same time, they provided their
affiliates with equity capital in the amount of
33.2 billion.
Other statistically recorded investment com-
prising financial and trade credits (where
these do not constitute direct investment) as
well as bank deposits and other assets saw
net inflows of funds to Germany of 331.0 bil-
lion in July. Non-banks accounted for 39.0 bil-
lion of this sum. The activities of general gov-
ernment resulted in capital imports in the
amount of 310.3 billion primarily owing to a
reduction of its foreign bank deposits. By con-
trast, transactions by enterprises and individ-
uals led to funds flowing abroad ( 31.2 bil-
lion). In this regard, the discharge of external
debt played a prominent role. The net exter-
nal position of the banking system contracted
by321.9 billion. This mainly affected credit
institutions ( 315.0 billion) which reduced, in
particular, their short-term financial liabilities
abroad while foreign-held deposits rose. The
Bundesbank also recorded inflows ( 36.9 bil-
lion). This was attributable, first and fore-
most, to a reduction in claims within the
large-value payment system TARGET2.

tion values – remained broadly unchanged in

15Developments in
lending to the German
private sector during
the global financial
crisisDomestic banks’ lending business with
the German private sector has slowed
down significantly since the third quar-
ter of 2008. This is especially true of
loans to non-financial corporations,
which have been on the decline since
the beginning of the year. Against the
backdrop of the financial crisis, this has
fuelled fears of a credit crunch. The
main concern in this context is that
such credit constraints might either
markedly exacerbate the economic
downturn or hamper a nascent real
economic recovery.
On the whole, consideration of a wide
set of indicators does not at present
provide clear-cut evidence that Ger-
many has already begun to experience
a credit crunch. The slowdown in lend-
ing to non-financial corporations can
be readily explained by traditional
factors, notably by the sluggish real
economic activity.
Looking ahead, however, it is possible
that, in the early stage of the nascent,
gradual economic recovery process in
Germany, bank credit supply might fall
short of corporate borrowing needs,
which could hinder the upturn. As
things stand today, however, although
there is a risk of such a development, it
is not the likeliest scenario.

16Recent trends in loans by German banks
to the public sector in Germany
The annual growth rate of loans to the
domestic private sector in Germany fell by
2.7 percentage points to 1.1% between July
2008 and July 2009. This pronounced weak-
ening is closely linked to the global financial
and economic crisis, and is particularly signifi-
cant because in Germany the domestic bank
loan is a key source of external finance for
enterprises and households. According to
financial account figures, it currently accounts
for roughly two-fifths of German non-
financial corporations’ debt. What is more,
households are indebted almost exclusively to
domestic banks.The current credit growth rate is not excep-
tionally high when compared over time. In
fact, it is identical to the average annual
growth rate from 2002 to the current end.
During this period, the growth of credit to
the German private sector was characterised
by some pronounced fluctuations, and even
stagnated at times.1Similar upward and
downward movements have also been
witnessed more recently. The annual growth
rate of lending to the German private sector
rose strongly from -0.1% in May 2007 to
3.8% in July 2008, whereas lending dynamics
have gone back down sharply since the third
quarter of 2008.
Growth of credit to the private sector has also
contracted strongly in the rest of the euro
area. However, this decline – excluding the
trend in Germany – already began at the end
of 2007. Since then, the 12-month rate for
the euro area has receded markedly and cur-
rently stands at only 0.6% (or 0.4% without
Germany). Unlike in Germany, however, the
decline in euro-area lending began from a
much higher level of growth. Due to the
sharp increase in real estate and corporate
loans, year-on-year growth in loans to the pri-
vate sector in the euro area stood at double
digits every month from the beginning of
2006 to the middle of 2008. For this reason,
the latest slump in lending was even more
pronounced in the euro area as a whole than
in Germany.Loans to domestic enterprises

17The striking drop in lending to the German
private sector since the third quarter of 2008has been driven by a very heterogeneousdevelopment in terms of the borrowers, thekey factor being loans to non-financial cor-porations. After these loans had risen signifi-cantly during the economic upturn in Ger-many starting from early 2006 onwards, the12-month rate fell sharply from 8.5% in June2008 to 1.2% in July 2009. The volume ofloans to non-financial corporations has de-clined since February of this year.
Loans to non-monetary financial institutions
such as, for example, insurers and pensionfunds present a different picture. Togetherwith loans to non-financial corporations, theydrove the rise in the growth of loans to thedomestic private sector between mid-2007and mid-2008. Yet unlike lending to the non-financial sector, they subsequently continuedto grow dynamically. One factor may be bankloans to special purpose vehicles, whoseother refinancing options had deteriorateddramatically as a result of the financial crisis.Another more important factor, however, isthat reverse repo transactions led increasinglyto extensive short-term lending by the bank-ing system to a domestic financial serviceprovider outside the banking system whichfor statistical purposes is classified as a non-monetary financial institution.
2
Nor is the household sector responsible forthe current slowdown in lending. The contri-bution accounted for by loans to householdsto growth of total unsecuritised lending hasbeen declining since January 2007. Whereasconsumer and other loans initially drove thereduction in lending to households, since the
beginning of 2008 the trend in lending to thehousehold sector has been shaped by loansfor house purchase. On balance, the negativegrowth has even weakened in recent months,and the other loans to households have againposted faintly positive year-on-year growthrates since February of this year.German banks’ loans

to other financial market players and the settlement of
these transactions via a central counterparty became
considerably more attractive in light of the financial crisis.Slowdown

18Trend in loans to non-financial
corporations since the third quarter
of 2008
Thus, the deceleration in domestic credit
growth to the private sector was driven main-
ly by loans to non-financial corporations.
However, this development did not affect all
banking groups, business sectors or matur-
ities in equal measure.
Growth in lending to non-financial corpo-
rations, especially by those banking groups
that were hit particularly hard by the global
financial crisis, has declined sharply. In July
2009, the annual growth rate in big banks’
loans to non-financial corporations stood at
0.1%, representing a drop of 7.9 percentage
points compared with July 2008.3The ratefor loans by regional and other commercial
banks4was down by 14.3 percentage points
to -0.1%, and loans from Landesbanken
were down by 5.1 percentage points to
2.0%. Following a brief spell in positive terri-
tory in the fourth quarter of 2008, the annual
percentage change in lending by mortgage
banks, which had been consistently reducing
their loans to non-financial corporations since
mid-2006, had also clearly returned to the
negative zone.Loans to non-financial corporations in Germany by banking group

19This contrasts in particular with loans by
credit cooperatives, whose annual growthrate in July 2009 was almost constant at7.0%. The savings banks, too, considerablyexpanded their credit to non-financial corpo-rations by an annual rate of 5.8%, althoughthe growth rate was 2.3 percentage pointsdown on the year. As a result, the savingsbanks and the credit cooperatives haveslightly increased their shares in the domesticmarket in this segment since the third quarterof 2008.
If one considers the business sectors individu-
ally, in June 2009
5loans to enterprises and
self-employed persons in Germany showed apositive annual rate of change for almost allsectors, with the exception of wholesale andretail trade and the (statistically quite broadlydefined) services sector. However, the annualgrowth rate for all economic sectors as awhole has contracted markedly since thefourth quarter of 2008. This trend has beendriven not only by wholesale and retail trade(including the repair of motor vehicles) andthe services sector but most notably by manu-facturing and, to a lesser extent, by transportand communication. In the more export-heavy manufacturing sector, credit growthwas weaker in almost all sub-groups. Particu-larly sharp declines in the annual growth ratewere recorded in the manufacture of basicmetals, mechanical engineering and themanufacture of transport equipment, all ofwhich are key sectors of the German econ-omy, even though the annual growth ratesstill remained at a higher level. In a number ofother, primarily domestically oriented sectors,by contrast, growth rates remained high oreven rose further. This is true of electricity, gas
and water supply as well as construction,which has also benefited from the Federal Gov-ernment’s two economic stimulus packages.
The deceleration of growth in loans to non-
financial corporations since the third quarterof 2008 affected all statistically recorded ma-turities, albeit to varying extents. The declinein the annual growth rate is especially pro-nounced for short-term loans (up to 1 year),which plummeted by 23.3 percentage pointsto -8.1% in July 2009 compared with July2008. The marked drop in lending to non-financial corporations, then, is due primarilyto an accelerated scaling-back of short-termloans, which is usual in periods of recession.German banks’ loans

20This was observed in all banking groups, al-
though it was particularly strong among the
big banks, Landesbanken and mortgage
banks.
Does the deceleration of credit growth
since the third quarter of 2008 mean a
credit crunch?
Given the fall in credit growth and the bur-
dens on banks due to the current financial cri-
sis, the fear increasingly expressed in public
debate is that the German economy is experi-
encing a “credit crunch”. Yet there is no gen-
erally accepted definition of this expression;
there only appears to be general agreement
that a credit crunch is characterised by a per-
ceptibly constrained credit supply. Definitions
used in economic literature and public debate
differ, for instance, with regard to whether
and to what extent the term “credit crunch”
refers only to credit constraints that are due
to certain factors or that have certain effects.
In the following, “credit crunch” will be
taken to mean a quantitative restriction on
credit supply so great as to constitute a major
economic risk.
The core problem in seeking to identify a
specific credit crunch empirically lies in the
difficulty of isolating with sufficient precision
the supply and demand-side factors of loan
development. For example, credit demand
tends to decline in a period of weak economic
activity. Households’ propensity to purchase
consumer durables or real estate decreases –
for example, because of the negative impact
on income prospects. In addition, enterpriseshave to finance a lower volume of working
capital, and planned investment in machinery
and equipment grows increasingly unat-
tractive.6
At the same time, the credit supply is cut
back in a recession as the probability of
default rises. Banks demand compensation
for the heightened risk by adding a higher
risk premium to the lending rate and by im-
posing stricter requirements on borrowers
with regard, say, to collateral. Normally, how-
ever, the resultant decline in lending is merely
a reflection of real economic activity, and
is necessary both microeconomically and
macroeconomically in that it helps to keep
macroeconomic risks low and prevents fun-
damentally non-justified developments which
could lead, in the longer term, to macroeco-
nomic imbalances. Thus, it is important in the
interest of efficient capital allocation.7This
relationship holds true not only in an eco-
nomic downturn. In an upturn, the general
risk situation improves, which, taken by itself,
increases credit supply. This gives the real
economy access to funds that may be needed
to boost economic activity. This has the effect
of reducing the danger that the upswing
6One likely result of the downturn in economic activity is
that enterprises’ ability to finance operations out of cur-
rent profits is reduced and they have temporarily higher
borrowing needs until they can sufficiently cut back their
current expenditure (cash flow effect). However, the re-
sultant rise in corporate demand for loans is likely to be
short-lived, as enterprises will adjust their expenditure
sooner or later.
7There is a danger, however, that banks will be too pes-
simistic about the actual risk situation and overly con-
strain their credit supply. See C Borio and H Zhu (2008),

21could be delayed or even prevented by credit
constraints.
Besides these real economic factors which in-
fluence credit supply, a prominent role is alsoplayed – in the present context of the finan-cial crisis – by bank-related factors such asfunding availability or the respective bank’scapital base. The massive refinancing prob-lems banks have experienced as a result ofthe global financial crisis entail a risk of nega-tive repercussions for their lending activity.This is particularly true of those institutionswhich, in light of a small deposit base,financed themselves through the financialmarkets on a large scale, and also of thoseinstitutions which resorted to securitisingtheir own assets to obtain funds, because theinterbank loans and structured financial in-struments which are central to such trans-actions were affected to a particular extentby the general loss of confidence sparked bythe financial crisis. Moreover, the crisis-induced losses in lending business couldcause the banks to retrench new lendingactivity because they want to or have tostrengthen their capital base.
A cut in credit supply due to constraints im-
posed by banks during a financial crisis mustbe judged differently in macroeconomicterms than a decline in credit supply due tothe deterioration of the would-be borrowers’creditworthiness. This is because such ad-ditional credit supply restrictions which arelinked to the financial crisis currently harbourthe danger of further weakening real eco-nomic growth by aggravating the banks’ situ-ation still further – for example, due to afurther rise in defaults and write-downs – and
thus causing banks to curb their credit supplyeven more.
Statistical and methodological problems
in identifying a credit crunch
To identify a credit crunch, therefore, it is
necessary to show that a substantial part –observable only ex post – of the macroeco-
nomic slowdown in credit growth is due to arestriction on the supply of credit, the extentof which markedly exceeds the usual patternand the causes of which are to be found inthe financial or banking sector. A decline incredit supply which adequately reflects onlythe usual influencing factors, notably realeconomic growth, would therefore not sub-stantiate the diagnosis of a credit crunch.
In practice, the empirical identification of a
credit crunch is exceedingly difficult. Observ-able quantitative lending growth is alwaysthe result of movements both in the supply ofand the demand for credit, which is to say itdoes not, in and of itself, allow conclusions tobe drawn about the existence of supply-siderestrictions. Nor does credit growth on itsown indicate the extent to which it has beendampened by restrictions imposed by thebanks. For this reason it is essential, whenseeking to diagnose a credit crunch, to use awide range of information in order to reducethe danger of overlooking relevant facts anddrawing false conclusions.

22sector, it will be at the focus of the following
section of this report.
Development in aggregated loans to
non-financial corporations
A simple historical comparison offers a first
opportunity to put current credit growth into
perspective. The decline, observed since
the third quarter of 2008, in the annual
growth rate of loans by German banks to
non-financial corporations has so far not
been fundamentally different from previous
years’ figures. Although the 12-month rate
has now reached the relatively low level of
pre-financial crisis years, at currently 1.2% it
is still in positive territory and a long way
from its low of -2.0% in the second quarter
of 2005. Although the decline in the growth
rate of loans to non-financial corporations
since October 2008 has been faster than in
the 2001-2003 period of cyclical weakness,
this could be the result of the unusually
severe slump in overall economic activity in
the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quar-
ter of 2009.
Econometric estimations are one way of
measuring the real sector’s influence on
lending trends. Single-equation estimation of
quarterly growth in loans to non-financial
corporations shows that real GDP and the
ratio of investment in machinery and equip-
ment, together with the interest rate spread
between corporate and government bonds,
has, as a measure of risk, strong explanatory
power for the estimation period from the first
quarter of 1991 to the second quarter of
2009. This applies in particular to the currentend of the data.8The present credit growth is
largely explained by real economic growth
and the interest rate spread. The estimation
therefore leaves no room for any further,
bank-imposed credit constraints. However,
some caution is called for when subscribing
to this interpretation, since it is possible that
the relationship expressed in the estimation
equation between real economic growth and
credit growth not only covers the determin-
ants of lending activity but also reflects the
impact of lending trends on real economic
growth, giving rise to a simultaneity problem.
Regardless of this problem, however, the esti-
mation offers no indication of any significant
structural change in the relationship between
credit growth and real economic growth at
the current end. In terms of traditional deter-
minants, therefore, the actual lending trend
has not been exceptional.
Disaggregated analysis of credit growth
The idea that the economic downturn and
the higher macroeconomic risks offer a good
explanation for the recent slowdown in credit
growth is supported by a credit growth analy-
sis broken down by maturity. The stronger
reduction in particular of short-term loans to
non-financial corporations points to a cyclical
decline in corporate financing needs for cur-
rent assets that is likely to be related, not
least, to a considerable contraction of manu-
facturing output. Moreover, earnings consid-
erations could have encouraged companies

24to replace part of their short-term loans with
medium and long-term loans in order to take
advantage of the lower capital market rates.
Another factor is that non-financial corpo-
rations are likely at present to be more inter-
ested in longer-term credit if they are con-
cerned that credit availability might be con-
strained in the near future. By contrast, at the
moment, banks are likely – out of risk and
earnings considerations – to be more interest-
ed in shorter-dated loans. However, this is
not reflected in the present shift in the matur-
ity structure towards longer-term loans. Thus,
the development of the maturity structure of
loans to non-financial corporations tends in
and of itself to indicate a dominance of
demand-related factors.
However, one argument in support of the as-
sertion that, besides macroeconomic factors,
bank-related determinants are also constrain-
ing credit supply could be that there was a
significant slowdown in credit growth as a
whole among those banking groups which
have been hit especially hard by the financial
crisis. By contrast, savings banks and credit
cooperatives continue to report an increase in
loans to non-financial corporations in Ger-
many, albeit with a downward trend. This is
undoubtedly an indication that neither of
these banking groups has so far experienced
any substantial shortages of liquidity or cap-
ital, whether because their business focus
gives them a large share of deposit business –
meaning they did not have to resort to mas-
sive funding on the interbank market to such
an extent as other banking groups – or be-
cause their own, as a rule, somewhat more
conservative asset management practicesinitially shielded them from substantial direct
losses as a result of the global financial crisis.
In this way, the savings banks and credit
cooperatives, which are engaged primarily in
retail banking, were able last year to continue
posting positive, though in some cases clearly
diminished, pre-tax results in 2008.9
Nor, however, may this trend in lending,
which is heterogeneous within the banking
industry, be overinterpreted as a possible indi-
cation of banks imposing credit constraints.
In particular, demand for credit could have
developed unevenly among the different
banking groups, and loan seekers that were
possibly rejected by banking groups with
tighter credit standards or conditions could
have received loans from others.
Development of lending conditions and
lending rates
Survey results might also indicate the possible
existence of a credit crunch. According to
Bank Lending Survey (BLS) data, since the
financial market turbulence began in the
third quarter of 2007 – and above all since
the third quarter of 2008 – the German
banks surveyed have in some cases tightened
their credit standards considerably.10Accord-
ing to the last survey round, the surveyed
institutions stated that, on balance, they had
tightened their credit standards only some-
what in the second quarter of 2009, and the

25quarter-on-quarter decline in the number of
banks that tightened their credit standardswas the strongest since the BLS was launchedin 2003.
For the question as to the possible existence
of a credit crunch, however, the data on thedifferent determinants of these, on thewhole, tighter credit standards are especiallyimportant.
11Factors affecting the banks – for
instance, higher cost of funds and balancesheet constraints, which in the BLS arebroken down into “costs of holding capitalreserves”, “banks’ financing conditions in themoney or bond markets” and “banks’ liquid-ity position” – played a major part in thetightening of standards for lending to non-financial corporations, especially in the firstyear of the financial crisis. By contrast, thesignificance of the financing conditions andthe liquidity position has, according to thebanks, declined perceptibly since the begin-ning of this year. This is also largely attribut-able to the generous provision of liquidity bythe Eurosystem. On the other hand, the sur-veyed institutions stated that the significanceof possible capital restrictions as a constraintgrew until the first quarter of 2009.
One point that argues against the relevance
of directly impacting bank-specific factors,which are key to the risk of a credit crunch,and in favour of a primarily real economy-driven reduction of credit supply is that, sincethe third quarter of 2008, above all the per-ception of risk, and notably the “overall eco-nomic outlook” and “industry or firm-specificoutlook”, have been cited as the reasons forChanges in BLS credit

26tightening standards in commercial banking
business.12
The results, broken down by enterprise size,
indicate that up to the fourth quarter of 2008
the credit standards of the surveyed banks for
loans to small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) were less tight. This is probably also
related to the fact that lending business with
SMEs is conducted to a greater extent by
credit institutions which fund themselves less
on the money and capital markets, making
them less vulnerable to funding problems
caused by financial market turbulence. In the
meantime, however, adjustments to credit
standards for loans to SMEs have moved
closer to those for large enterprises. There are
probably two reasons for this – first, the
growing impact of the business cycle on all
banks’ credit standards and second, the fact
that SMEs are on average more dependent
on the domestic economy, meaning they
were affected by the crisis later on. Surveys
among enterprises, too, confirm that, in the
course of the financial crisis, credit supply
conditions for larger firms deteriorated to a
greater extent than for SMEs, but that this
divide has recently lessened somewhat.13
The banks’ interest rate pass-through in cor-
porate lending likewise indicates that the
response pattern currently shown by banks
does not deviate strikingly from normal cyclic-
al behaviour. In the wake of the interest rate
cuts by the Eurosystem, bank interest rates
for corporate loans have declined as a whole
since November 2008, although recently the
pace of decline was slower compared with
previous months. Econometric estimatesbased on pre-crisis interest rate pass-through
provide no indication that banks have been
exceptionally slow to pass on the greatly re-
duced refinancing costs as a result of mone-
tary policy easing to short-term lending
rates.14
On the danger of a credit crunch in the
cyclical recovery phase
Overall, considerations so far indicate that
the most recent slowdown in lending to non-
financial corporations in Germany may largely
be explained by real economic activity, al-
though a certain influence of bank-related
factors cannot be ruled out. Thus, there is
strong evidence that the slowdown to date in
lending to German non-financial corporations
does not reflect a credit crunch.
The economy is likely to stabilise further in
the months ahead, although this does not
12However, it should be noted that, besides an actual
increase in risks, these data could also reflect a change in
banks’ risk appetite. Yet this, too, would not in and of it-
self necessarily point to a credit crunch if the banks’ risk
appetite had previously been slightly too high. Indeed,
such behaviour is often interpreted as a cause of the
global financial crisis. It is unlikely to have played an im-
portant role with regard to domestic lending by German
banks, however.
13See, for example, the regular survey results of the Ifo
credit constraint indicator and the corporate surveys con-
ducted by the German Chamber of Industry and Com-
merce.
14The analysis excludes longer-term loans, as there is
likely to have been a marked change in German financial
institutions’ wholesale funding during the financial mar-
ket crisis. For example, there has probably been a distinct
decline in the importance of the capital market for
banks’ refinancing and therefore in the relevance of the
yield on bank bonds, which is typically the starting point
for studies on the pass-though of interest rates. See

27guarantee that the bottoming-out will soon
give way to a sustained recovery. If, in thecourse of this recovery process, bank creditsupply were to grow more slowly than de-mand, however, the fundamental dangerexists that this might dampen macroeconom-ic activity. This could delay or, in a worst casescenario, frustrate the economic upswing.
It must be borne in mind, however, that at
previous cyclical turning points lendinggrowth lagged real economic growth. A cer-tain lag, ie a continued weakness in the de-velopment of credit aggregates even after thefirst signs of real economic stabilisation, istherefore a common pattern. After the lasttwo cyclical slowdowns in 1992-1993 and2001-2003, in which growth of loans to non-financial corporations also dropped sharply, adiscernible recovery in lending did not kick inuntil several quarters after the macroeconom-ic downturn had ended.
Usually, several factors contribute to the ini-
tially still sluggish credit growth at the begin-ning of an economic upswing. For instance,non-financial corporations tend to be reluc-tant to make new investments in fixed assetsat the beginning of an economic recovery inorder to make greater use of underutilisedcapacity, and to see how their earnings pro-spects develop. This is probably particularlyrelevant in the current situation. According toexisting data, capacity utilisation is currentlyat a very low level. Annual average underutil-isation has surpassed by far the lows of previ-ous recessions. For this reason, firms shouldbe able to expand production comparativelyvigorously in the coming cyclical recoveryphase without having to make new invest-
ments in fixed assets and, therefore, withouthaving to apply for the requisite loans.
What is more, economic recovery is associ-
ated with improved corporate profitability,with the result that companies are increasing-ly able to cover any rise in capital needs bydrawing on funds they have generated fromretained earnings and charging depreciationCyclical sensitivity of loans to

28against revenue. This happened, for example,
in the years after the 2001-2003 period of
cyclical weakness when, despite expanding
investment budgets, companies’ internal
funds provided adequate scope for obtaining
finance and companies’ financing balance
consistently remained in positive territory
until 2007.
Yet supply-side factors also argue in favour of
a delayed increase in credit growth in the first
cyclical recovery phase. If one considers ear-
lier cyclical downturns, it may be seen that
insolvency rates usually responded with a
certain time lag. This means that even after
cyclical recovery gets underway, insolvency
figures could initially remain at a rather ele-
vated level or even rise. This pattern was
especially pronounced in the 1990s, when
the absolute number of bankruptcies rose
rapidly until 1997. Whereas the number of
corporate insolvencies in Germany virtually
stagnated in 2008, it has risen markedly in
the current year. The increase was above-
average in manufacturing, transport and
business-related services, ie in the sectors that
were at the heart of the recession. By con-
trast, the number of business failures in con-
struction, one of the main beneficiaries of the
economic stimulus programmes, was even
lower in the first half of 2009 than one year
before. If insolvency figures keep rising, do-
mestic banks are likely to find themselves
with increasing write-downs. It should be
noted in this context, however, that manufac-
turing firms have raised their capital base
across the board in recent years, bolstering
their financial robustness substantially in the
process.15Besides this influence of real economic devel-
opments, bank-related factors dampening
credit suppl y – a hitherto less salient aspect –
could, however, play a more significant part.
In particular, the German banking industry
could consider itself forced by capital bottle-
necks not to expand credit supply in the cy-
clical upswing for the time being, or indeed
to make a substantial and lasting reduction to
corporate loans that goes beyond the pattern
described above.16In the current situation,
heightened market expectations that banks
will hold own funds clearly in excess of the
regulatory capital requirement could also con-
tribute to this. What is more, the Basel Com-
mittee on Banking Supervision is currently
considering raising capital requirements in
order to give a long-term boost to the stabil-
ity of the international banking system. There
is a consensus, however, that stricter capital
requirements should not be applied until
after the end of the present economic crisis in
order not to jeopardise the recovery.17
There might also be other motives behind ef-
forts on the part of some credit institutions to
reduce their balance sheet totals, notably the

17Besides strengthening the capital base, measures to
dampen the cyclical effects of regulatory minimum cap-
ital requirements are currently also at the centre of dis-
cussion. One conceivable approach would be to imple-
ment countercyclical capital buffers that “breathe” over
the cycle and absorb the increase in risk-sensitive capital
requirements in the event of an economic downturn.Insolvency rates

29need in some cases to change the focus of
their business model as well as any require-ments that are linked to government guaran-tees or capital injections.
Indeed, the German banking industry has
been deleveraging, ie reducing leverage ontheir balance sheets, since the fourth quarterof 2008.
18German banks significantly re-
duced asset positions directly connected withbanking business after the global financialcrisis escalated. This is also reflected in amarked reduction in their balance sheet to-tals. The extent of this decline was exception-ally strong, even compared with the 2002-2005 period. Although the biggest reductionswere made between November 2008 andApril 2009, this trend has continued in aweaker form up to the current end. To date,the reduction has mainly affected external
assets, interbank assets, equities and othervariable-rate securities.
Thus, when the financial crisis escalated fol-
lowing the collapse of US investment bankLehman Brothers, external assets, of whichcross-border interbank loans alone made upmore than two-thirds, were the first totumble. After the turn of the year, loans todomestic banks slumped as well. The mainreason for the decline in exposures to domes-tic and foreign banks is likely to have beenthe drying-up of trading activity in the globalfinancial markets.

30external assets was amplified, moreover, by a
conscious scaling back of the activities of do-
mestic banks through international financial
centres in the likes of the United Kingdom
and Asia. Most recently, the reduction in ex-
ternal assets and exposures to domestic
banks has slowed down somewhat compared
with the fourth quarter of 2008, yet remains
at an elevated level.
So far, however, banks’ deleveraging has had
less of an impact on lending to the domestic
private sector. Basically speaking, the financial
institutions, in reducing their assets, are likely
to endeavour to keep their private-sector
lending broadly stable and initially to trim pri-
marily their liquidity buffers, ie their stocks of
liquid assets. The main reasons for doing so
are the lower liquidity of loans and the banks’
aim to maintain existing close ties with their
borrowers for as long as possible. The grow-
ing strains on the capital base of banks –
above all, due to further write-downs arising
from the weakness in real economic activity –
could, however, lead to a heightened prob-
ability that the reduction of assets will in-
creasingly also affect loans to the domestic
non-financial corporate sector.
If, as a result of ongoing deleveraging, the
credit supply by banks actually were to fall
short of enterprises’ borrowing requirements,
this need not necessarily have a negative im-
pact on the German corporate sector. Larger
firms in particular have, as a general principle,
other sources of external funding besides the
domestic bank loan. However, the extent to
which these alternative sources, abroad or in
the capital market, may be tapped in a futurephase of global cyclical recovery is hard to as-
sess, because they, too, have been affected
by the global financial crisis.
Above all, there has been a sharp decline in
financial credit from foreign banks and sub-
sidiaries so far this year, after they had gained
considerably in importance in the years be-
fore. Borrowing through the issuance of debt
securities – though traditionally less signifi-
cant in Germany – and the sale of equities
also remains subject to high levels of uncer-
tainty despite a positive trend in the global
financial markets in recent months. In this
context, it would have an alleviating effect if
German enterprises – particularly SMEs –
were to make greater use of the possibilities
to raise funds through the capital markets in
future than they have done in the past. What
is more, cross-border trade credits are of im-
portance to internationally operating German
enterprises, as they ensure that intermediate
inputs do not have to be paid for immediately
and so provide at least short-term scope for
obtaining finance. Trends in cross-border
trade credit usually follow the business cycle,
for which reason they, too, have experienced
a sharp decline in connection with the drop in
the international flow of goods since the
fourth quarter of 2008.
Overall, what these considerations indicate is
that, in the first phase of an incipient eco-
nomic recovery, German non-financial cor-
porations as a whole would be able – in
particular because of their fundamentally
strengthened resilience, spare production

31financing options – to bridge a certain period
of time until German banks’ credit supply
picks up again. Thus, potential restrictions to
credit supply would not necessarily and dir-
ectly place an appreciable burden on the
economy as a whole. A further factor is that
the banks themselves do not at present at-
tach much importance to the possible risk of
banks adversely affecting credit supply.
Responses given during a special survey that
the Deutsche Bundesbank conducted among
selected banks and banking associations in
July provided little indication of an imminent
credit crunch in business with domestic non-
financial corporations.19On the whole, survey
participants stated that they do not expect
any decline in their new lending activities in
the second half of 2009 and in 2010. Despite
plans to reduce their balance sheets, the ma-
jority of the larger banks expect lending to be
largely unchanged; smaller banks are even
expecting their lending business to grow.
In keeping with this picture, supervisory sensi-
tivity analyses based on data from solvency
reports currently conclude that the German
banks, given their present capital base, would
weather an across-the-board fall in their bor-
rowers’ creditworthiness without under-
shooting the Basel II minimum capital require-
ments.20
Conclusions
The sharp slowdown in the growth of loans
by German banks to the domestic private sec-
tor since the third quarter of 2008, which
was mainly driven by the trend in loans tonon-financial corporations, does not indicate
a credit crunch. Despite isolated signs of
bank-related credit constraints, the indicators
considered here instead suggest, on the
whole, that the weaker growth in credit activ-
ity can be explained primarily by a decline in
demand for credit and a more cautious lend-
ing policy by banks which can be expected in
the face of gloomier economic prospects and,
as a result, of greater risks.
This diagnosis of the current situation does
not, however, preclude the possibility that it
could prove more difficult to overcome the
recession in Germany if the effects of the
credit supply intensify in future. In particular,
when credit demand picks up again in the
economic recovery phase, possible bank-
imposed restrictions to the credit supply
could end up throttling the economy and
hampering the upturn. However, given the
current high level of production capacity
underutilisation, a nascent economic upswing
is likely to be less dependent on bank loans
than in past cycles. In this context, it would
also have an easing effect if small and
medium-sized enterprises in particular were
to reduce their dependence on bank loans in
the long term and finance themselves more
through the capital markets. Looking ahead,
the factors described above – together with
the improving internal financing conditions
led by a real economic brightening, paired
with non-financial corporations’ fundamen-

advent of a substantial credit shortage repre-
sents a risk scenario rather than the baseline
scenario of macroeconomic activity.
However, the longer the banks take to adjust
their balance sheets, the more relevant this
risk scenario could become. To make the ad-
justment process easier for the banking sys-
tem, the Federal Government implemented
measures mandated by the broad-based
Financial Market Stabilisation Fund ( Sonder-
fonds Finanzmarktstabilisierung, orSoFFin )through guarantees for newly issued bank
bonds and recapitalisation measures. More-
over, the Act on Further Development of
Financial Stabilisation ( Gesetz zur Fortent-
wicklung der Finanzmarktstabilisierung ) en-
ables banks to transfer high-risk assets to bad
banks, thereby preserving their own capital. If
the stabilising effect of these extensive meas-
ures is to take full effect, however, it is essen-
tial that particularly those banks that face
equity or liquidity bottlenecks due to the
financial crisis make use of these instruments
without delay.

33The performance
of German credit
institutions in 2008The performance of German credit in-
stitutions in the financial year 2008
was shaped crucially by the effects of
the financial crisis. In comparison with
2007, there was a massive slump of
345.5 billion in the profit for the finan-
cial year before tax. This meant that a
loss of 325.0 billion was recognised for
the first time. The big banks, Landes-
banken, mortgage banks and special
purpose banks were especially affect-
ed. By contrast, the savings banks,
credit cooperatives and regional banks
were still able to post a pre-tax profit
in 2008, even though this was notice-
ably lower than before in some cases.
It was in own-account trading, in par-
ticular, that German banks were forced
to show dramatic losses. Added to
this were considerably higher valu-
ation charges and exceptionally large
strains from financial investment busi-
ness. Although German banks gener-
ated substantial income from the re-
lease of reserves overall, there was still
a balance sheet loss for the first time,
although this was concentrated on a
few categories of bank.
Despite signs of a recovery in the first
half of the financial year 2009, a sus-
tained improvement in performance
for the financial year 2009 is unlikely
given the increasing strains on lending
business.

34Income from interest business
Despite the crisis in the financial markets,
interest business in 2008 just about matched
the level of the previous year and showed no
more than a slight decline in net interest re-
ceived (difference between interest received
and interest paid). The percentage increase in
interest expenses (+4.5% to 3342.1 billion)
was greater than that in interest income
(+3.3% to 3432.7 billion). Overall, for the
first time in five years, net interest received by
German credit institutions showed a slight fall
of31.0 billion to 390.6 billion.1The interest
margin – calculated as net interest received in
relation to the average balance sheet total –
declined accordingly from 1.12% in 2007 to
1.09% in 2008. In consolidated terms – ie
after adjustment for interbank business, whichhas no effect on net interest received –
the interest margin remained constant in
year-on-year terms at 1.52%. The share of
net interest received in operating income
(net interest received and net commissions
received plus net profit or loss from financial
operations and net other operating income or
charges) showed a clear increase to 84.6%,
since operating income fell sharply overall in
the reporting year.
In terms of the individual components of the
interest result, German credit institutions,
given a larger volume of business and despite
a predominantly flat and, at times, inverse
yield curve, were able to increase their in-
come from lending and money market trans-
actions as well as from debt securities and
Debt Register claims. Nevertheless, current
income from shares and other variable-yield
securities showed a marked fall of more than
30% owing to the reduction in trading port-
folios. As a result, it was not possible to offset
the overall higher interest expenditures.
Developments across the individual categor-
ies of banks were quite heterogeneous, main-
ly on account of their differing business fo-
cuses. The decrease in net interest received
– primarily as a result of the perceptible re-
duction in current income from shares and
other variable-yield securities – was concen-
trated chiefly on the big banks, which showedThe performance of

1Net interest received was, however, influenced by a
one-off effect in the case of one German big bank, as is
shown by its published annual report. Consequently, a
time comparison is subject to a number of caveats. Ad-
justment for this effect produces a slight increase of
2.3% in net interest received for the reporting period.Slight decline

35a decline of 11% to 321.8 billion.2However,
the share of net interest received in totaloperating income, which is traditionally com-paratively small for this category of banks,amounted to 123.9% in the reporting yearand thus almost doubled. This was due to themarkedly lower operating income for this cat-egory of banks compared with 2007, withoperating income being adversely affected bya very high net loss on financial operations.As there was only a very small reduction inthe balance sheet total, the big banks record-ed an overall decline in the interest margin of0.10 percentage point to 0.99%.
Those categories of banks for which classical
lending and deposit business is traditionallyvery important mostly showed no majorchange in their net interest income, however.Credit cooperatives’ net interest received re-
mained at the previous year’s level of 313.2
billion, while savings banks recorded a slight0.5% decline to 320.9 billion. Furthermore,
the decline in credit cooperatives’ and savingsbanks’ interest margins continued for thefifth year in succession (by 0.09 percentagepoint to 2.06% and by 0.06 percentage pointto 2.00% respectively). This meant that, inthe reporting year, both categories of banksrecorded their lowest ever interest marginInterest received and interest paid by credit institutions in the interest cycle

2According to the annual report mentioned in foot-
note 1, this was due, more than anything, to a one-off
effect at a single institution. Adjustment for this effect
produces a slight increase of 1.9% in net interest received
for the category of big banks during the reporting period.
As a retroactive reduction in net interest received for the
financial year 2007 meant that this one-off effect was
offset by a matching increase in this institution’s own-
account trading income, the operating profit and the op-
erating result of the category of big banks remained un-
affected by this.Mixed develop-

36since statistics on banks’ profitability have
been recorded. In contrast to this, regional
banks were able to achieve growth in interest
business; their net interest received went up
by 3.2% to 313.6 billion. Lastly, Landesban-
ken and regional institutions of credit co-
operatives, which, structurally, tend to have
quite a small interest margin owing to their
focus on wholesale and interbank business,
likewise recorded a marked increase in their
net interest received. Their interest margins
rose from 0.65% to 0.72% and from 0.50%
to 0.58% respectively.
Net commissions received
In the reporting year, German credit institu-
tions were unable to maintain the high
growth rates of previous years. Declining
commission income led to a fall in net com-
missions received of 32.1 billion (-6.4%) to
329.6 billion. Net commissions received there-
fore accounted for 0.36% of the average bal-
ance sheet total, compared with 0.39% in
2007. Despite this fall in absolute terms, the
sharp reduction in operating income meant
that net commissions received, when meas-
ured as a share of operating business, showed
an overall year-on-year increase of 2.5 per-
centage points to 27.7%.
The decline in commissions received in the re-
porting year was due mainly to significantly
higher risk aversion and the associated reduc-
tion in capital market investment in the wake
of the financial crisis. The volume of sales on
the German equity markets showed a marked
fall and, at 35.5 trillion, was nearly 16%down on the year. There was also a marked
slump in domestic enterprises’ issuance activ-
ity. Compared with 21 initial public offerings
(IPOs) in 2007, only two companies decided
on an IPO in 2008. Furthermore, bank cus-
tomers also showed less interest in mutual
fund shares last year; purchases of mutual
fund shares by domestic non-banks alone de-
clined in 2008 by 328.2 billion (-54.9%) to
323.1 billion. Lastly, there were also fewer
sales in German bond trading.
The marked decline in net commission re-
ceived affected mainly the big banks and re-
gional banks, for which this area of business
is traditionally very important. Overall, the dif-
ference between commissions received and
commissions paid by these two categories of
banks decreased by 31.8 billion, ie 88% of
the fall in net commissions received by all the
banks, to 315.7 billion. Despite this notice-
able decline, together they generated more
than one-half of total net commissions re-
ceived by all the German banks in 2008. Dur-
ing the reporting period, net commissions re-
ceived by the big banks and the regional
banks accounted, respectively, for 56.2% and
29.8% of their operating income.
In contrast to the big banks and the regional
banks, both the savings banks and the credit
cooperatives recorded a comparatively small
decline in their net commissions received. In
2008, the savings banks’ result fell by 1.5%
to36.0 billion and that of the credit coopera-
tives by 2.4% to 34.0 billion. The fact that
these two categories of banks suffered only a

37likely to be due primarily to their result de-
pending significantly less on developments in
the stock markets. This is also evident over
time, not least, from this income item having
a lower volatility for these categories of
banks. The Landesbanken likewise recorded a
decline in their net commissions received of
3.1% to 32.2 billion, while net commissions
received by the regional institutions of credit
cooperatives showed a marginal increase.
Net profit or loss on financial operations
Net loss or profit on own-account trading in
securities, financial instruments, foreign ex-
change assets and precious metals was
dramatically affected by the financial crisis.
Overall, German credit institutions’ loss on
financial operations increased on the year by
317.6 billion to 318.8 billion in 2008. In abso-
lute terms, this was the highest loss for the
period 1993-2008.3An additional factor to
be considered in this context is that securities
in the trading portfolio and the liquidity re-
serve were allocated by German banks to
their financial investment portfolio in 2008
– sometimes on a considerable scale – which,
in itself, boosted profitability (trading result,
net income or net charges from the valuation
of assets).4
According to the data published in the annual
reports, large write-downs on structured prod-
ucts5as well as major losses in derivatives
business were the key reasons for the dra-
matic deterioration in own-account trading
figures. This reflected, among other things,
the insolvency of US investment bank Leh-man Brothers and, to a lesser extent, write-
downs on specific foreign investments and
depreciations in connection with monoline
insurers. Although profits were generated in
trading in foreign exchange assets and pre-
cious metals, these failed to offset the losses.
Most of the losses in own-account trading
were suffered by the big banks, which record-
ed a loss of 315.4 billion. This came after
generating a profit on own-account trading
of nearly 31.8 billion in the preceding year
despite the adverse impact of the financial
market turbulence.6According to the data
published in the annual reports, not all insti-
tutions in this category were affected equally
by the deterioration, however. As in 2007,
the Landesbanken, too, (chiefly one institu-
tion) recorded a marked loss on own-account
trading; this amounted to 31.5 billion, which
was, however, 30.2 billion lower than in the
previous year. The loss of the regional institu-
tions of credit cooperatives, whose financial
operations generally also make a significant
3The definition of the observation period is due to a
comprehensive change in the accounting and classifica-
tion rules for the profit and loss accounts of German
credit institutions, which was introduced in 1993. See
Deutsche Bundesbank, The profitability of German credit
institutions in 1993, Monthly Report, October 1994,
pp 19-47.
4As a result of such reclassifications, the securities in
question are no longer subject to the strict but to the
moderate “lower of cost or market” principle. Accord-
ingly, in the event of a temporary decline in value, extra-
ordinary write-downs are no longer compulsory but sub-
ject to the discretion of the accounting institution.
5This concerns, in particular, asset-backed securities
(ABS), residential or commercial mortgage backed secur-
ities (RMBS, CMBS) and collateralised debt obligations
(CDO).
6Owing to adjusted higher own-account trading profits,
inclusion of the one-off effect at a German big bank dis-
cussed in the context of the interest result (see footnote 2)
would result in both a markedly larger recorded decline
within the category of big banks and a markedly larger
reduction in the overall aggregate.Dramatic

of regional banks, whose own-account trad-
ing normally plays a more secondary role in
operational business, recorded a loss of 31.0
billion in 2008, which was only marginally
larger than in 2007. For the profitability of
other institutions active in retail business
– savings banks and credit cooperatives – as
well as of mortgage banks and special pur-

Administrative spending
Overall, German banks cut their administra-
tive spending in 2008 by 32.9 billion to 378.6
billion; in relation to the balance sheet total,this was equivalent to a reduction from
1.00% in 2007 to 0.94% in the reporting
year. This reduction resulted to a very large
extent from cutting staff costs by 6.0% to
341.9 billion. This was due to both the declin-
ing number of employees (657,850 in 2008
compared with 662,650 in 2007) and notice-
ably lower spending on bonuses and profit
sharing. Other administrative spending, which
essentially comprises operating expenditure,
expenditure on third-party services, as well as
write-offs and write-downs of tangible fixed
assets, was reduced slightly by 30.3 billion to
336.7 billion.

ministrative spending made by the big banks

since variable and performance-related salary
components play a major role for this cat-
egory of banks, while other administrative
spending showed a marginal rise of 0.3%.
The regional banks, however, recorded a rise
in both staff costs and other administrative
spending, which ultimately led to a notice-
able 3.8% increase in their total administra-
tive costs to 312.5 billion. The Landesbanken,
too, recorded a slight rise in their administra-

By contrast, the regional institutions of credit

comparison with the previous year.Net other operating income or charges
German credit institutions’ net other operat-

42due, not least, to the sale of business units,
positive effects of currency conversion, and
the release of provisions. For all other cat-
egories of banks, there were only minor
changes compared with the previous year.
Operating result before the valuation
of assets
Given the massive losses on own-account
trading, there was a marked decline of 315.6
billion to 328.4 billion in German banks’ op-
erating result before the valuation of assets in
2008. It was the big banks that were affected
most severely. Owing to the loss of 315.4 bil-
lion on own-account trading, their operating
result before the valuation of assets slumped
by316.9 billion to - 35.0 billion. Regional banks
and mortgage banks also recorded a decline
on the year of 30.6 billion (to 37.1 billion)
and30.5 billion (to 32.3 billion) respectively,
although it was small in relation to the overall
aggregate; this was due mainly to higher
administrative spending in the case of the
regional banks and to lower net interest
received in the case of mortgage banks. In
the case of the regional institutions of credit
cooperatives, the operating result before the
valuation of assets underwent only minor
changes.
By contrast – owing, in particular, to higher
net interest received – the operating result
before the valuation of assets in the case of
the Landesbanken showed a marked increase
of nearly 31.5 billion to 36.1 billion. The credit
cooperatives and special purpose banks like-
wise recorded increases of 30.5 billion (to36.0 billion) and 30.3 billion (to 33.0 billion)
respectively on account of an improvement in
other operating income or charges and high-
er net interest received. The savings banks,
too, showed an increase in their operating
result before the valuation of assets, albeit a
small one of 30.1 billion to 38.6 billion, pri-
marily because of lower administrative spend-
ing.
Net income or net charges from the
valuation of assets
Following an increase of roughly 39.6 billion
in 2007, there was a further marked rise of
nearly 313 billion in German credit institu-
tions’ net charges from the valuation of se-
curities of the liquidity reserve, claims and
loans. At 336.6 billion, they exceeded their
previous peak level of 2002 ( 331.2 billion).9
Net valuation charges in relation to the bal-
ance sheet total went up to 0.44% from
0.29% in 2007.
Across the various categories of banks, the
aggregate rise in risk provisioning in compari-
son with 2007 was due mainly to increases
at big banks (+ 34.2 billion), Landesbanken
(+36.4 billion) and mortgage banks (+ 32.7
billion), whereas special purpose banks had a
significantly dampening effect on the aggre-
gate owing to a reduction in risk provisions
(-33.1 billion). Despite the year-on-year re-
duction in special purpose banks’ risk provi-

billion in 2008 (compared with 37.8 billion in

10There were also
marked increases in risk provisioning com-pared with the previous year in the case ofregional banks (+ 31.0 billion) and credit co-
operatives (+ 30.9 billion). Savings banks’ net
valuation charges showed a rise of 30.5 bil-

10As in 2007, the net valuation charges of this category
of banks were crucially determined, according to the
data published in the annual reports, by one bank and an
institution affiliated to it, whose participatory relationship
ended in 2008, however. In the reporting year 2007, the
net valuation charges of special purpose banks grew by
37.2 billion to 37.8 billion, mainly on account of risk-
shielding measures taken by this bank in favour of the af-
filiated institution in connection with the financial market
turbulence. This was therefore a crucial factor responsible
for the 39.6 billion increase in the previous year’s aggre-
gate. See also Deutsche Bundesbank, The performance
of German credit institutions in 2007, Monthly Report,
September 2008, p 23.
11Furthermore, measured by the balance sheet total,
risk provisioning by Landesbanken (0.50%), mortgage
banks (0.48%) and special purpose banks (0.53%) in the
reporting year attained a level hitherto typically shown
only by savings banks and credit cooperatives given the
greater importance of lending business in their case; their
risk provisioning in relation to the balance sheet total, at
0.47% and 0.56% respectively, was at the level of the
past few years. Special purpose banks, at 0.96%, had al-
ready clearly exceeded this level in the reporting year
2007 owing to the special factors described above.Direct and

44mainly to the marked increase in write-downs
in foreign business following the insolvency
of US investment bank Lehmann Brothers as
well as to some significantly higher country
risks in connection with the financial crisis. In
the reporting year, domestic lending business
is likely to have played a secondary role in net
income from the valuation of assets. Here,
the deterioration in expectations regarding
general economic activity in the wake of the
financial crisis was cited as the key determin-
ant of higher risk provisioning. Moreover, des-
pite the fact that 2008 saw an almost 6%
year-on-year fall in the number of insolv-
encies (among which: business insolvencies
+0.4%; consumer insolvencies -6.7%), the
simultaneous increase in the volume of prob-
lem assets associated with these insolvencies
from 331.5 billion to 333.5 billion is also likely
to have resulted in slightly higher charges,
stemming mostly from domestic lending busi-
ness with firms.12The aggregate increase in
problem loans was driven inter alia by a
marked 34 billion increase in potential de-
faults arising from business insolvencies to
322.1 billion (+22%), whereas potential loan
defaults in connection with consumer insolv-
encies showed a slight fall of 30.5 billion to
35.7 billion. This represents an increase in
problem loans arising from business insolven-
cies, as a share of all potential loan defaults,
from 57% in 2007 to 66% in 2008.
Judging by the data published in the annual
reports, risk provisioning for securities of the
liquidity reserve is likely to have been influ-
enced primarily by the financial market turbu-
lence. Write-downs on debt securities, which
increased by roughly 80% on the year to atotal of 38.8 billion due mainly to wider inter-
est rate spreads and which were recorded in
some cases under net charges, are likely to
have been a significant factor in this context.
Furthermore, net valuation charges were ad-
versely affected by increased write-downs of
shares and losses from the sale and valuation
of own shares. According to data published
in the annual reports, net income from the
valuation of assets was bolstered slightly at
some banks by the liquidation of undisclosed
reserves (pursuant to section 340 (f) of the
German Commercial Code).
The results presented in this article are based
on the individual financial statements of Ger-
man banks and on the accounting rules of
the German Commercial Code. Consequent-
ly, the present analysis takes no account of
group-level transactions that affect income.
Furthermore, for individual items the valu-
ation criteria of the German Commercial
Code may result in a valuation that is less ori-
ented to temporary market fluctuations. By
contrast, data on the profit and loss accounts
of individual categories of banks sometimes
published elsewhere differ to some extent
considerably from those in the present study,
not least owing to the impact of the financial
crisis on balance sheets. These data are typic-
ally based on other accounting standards
(IFRS) and on more broadly defined consoli-
dated balance sheets.

45Operating result
Owing to the massive increase in the net valu-
ation charges of some categories of banks in
connection with the financial crisis, the oper-
ating result after valuation compared with
the operating result before the valuation of
assets showed a further marked decline in
2008, falling by 328.6 billion on the year to
its lowest level since 1993 (- 38.1 billion).
By far the largest decline – of 321.1 billion to
-312.0 billion – was recorded by big banks
which suffered not only marked increases in
net valuation charges but also an even larger
loss through own-account trading. A distinct
rise in net valuation charges also led to a de-
cline in the operating results of the Landes-
banken and mortgage banks (by 34.9 billion
to -32.4 billion and by 33.2 billion to - 31.7
billion respectively), whereas the institutions
active in retail banking, in particular, showed
positive figures despite considerable reduc-
tions in some cases. The regional banks re-
corded the most obvious fall – - 31.5 billion to
34.1 billion – which was also largely due to
higher net valuation charges than in the pre-
vious year. The decline in the case of savings
banks (- 30.4 billion to 33.7 billion) and credit
cooperatives (- 30.4 billion to 32.4 billion)
– likewise due mainly to higher net valuation
charges – was much smaller.
Special purpose banks were the only category
of banks to show a reduced burden of risk
provisioning compared with the previous
year; their net valuation charges were 33.1
billion lower. Nevertheless, as in 2007, their
operating result, at - 31.7 billion, was negativesince the impact of the fall in net valuation
charges from 37.8 billion to 34.7 billion in
2008 was still the dominant factor.
Other and extraordinary income or
charges
While the “extraordinary account” was more
or less balanced in 2007 owing to a one-off
effect, it had an exceptionally strong negative
impact on German banks’ profit and loss ac-
counts in the year under review; the balance
of the “extraordinary account” fell from 30.1
billion in 2007 to - 316.9 billion in 2008. The
key factor in this massive deterioration was
the result from financial investment business
(-313.5 billion compared with - 35.0 billion in
2007), which was due mainly to write-downsRisk provisioning

46of participating interests and securities in the
trading portfolio. Added to this were higher
net loss transfers ( 31.6 billion compared with
30.9 billion) and charges incurred through
derived profits of 33.5 billion, which was,
however, less than in the previous year ( 34.9
billion). As usual, the net position resulting
from the release of or transfers to special
items with an equity portion was of only
minor importance ( 389 million compared
with - 327 million). Lastly, net extraordinary in-
come or charges in the narrower sense ( 31.7
billion) boosted the figure, as it had done in
2007 ( 30.8 billion).
Almost all categories of banks considered in
this article recorded a deterioration in their
“extraordinary account” in 2008. The deteri-
oration was especially marked in the case ofbig banks, which had shown a positive bal-
ance in 2007 owing to one-off transaction.
Their performance in financial investment
business as well as increased loss transfers
were the reason for this.13Furthermore, the
Landesbanken, special purpose banks and
savings banks were subject to greater strains
arising from the “extraordinary account” in
2008; in all cases, net income from financial
investment business had a crucial impact on
the “extraordinary account”. According to
the data published in the annual reports,
however, this negative factor was concen-
trated on a small number of institutions in

47banks sectors. In the category of savings
banks, for which the balance on “extraordin-
ary account” typically has no major import-
ance, the negative result was probably due in
part to write-downs of (indirect) participating
interests in Landesbanken. Moreover, this
means that not all institutions of the savings
bank sector were equally affected. The scale
of the aggregated changes in the other cat-
egories of banks considered here remained
relatively limited, however, even though
mortgage banks and regional banks alike re-
corded considerable net charges from the
“extraordinary account”. In the case of the
regional banks, this was due almost exclusive-
ly to profit transfers, which are traditionally
a dominant factor in the “extraordinary ac-
count” of this category of banks.
Profit for the financial year, taxes on
income and earnings
Given the considerable strain due to the
“extraordinary account”, the profit for the
financial year before tax recorded by German
banks slumped by 345.5 billion in 2008, thus
falling more sharply than the operating result.
The loss for the financial year before tax stood
at -325.0 billion, compared with a profit of
320.5 billion in 2007. In the wake of the dra-
matically increased valuation charges in con-
nection with the financial crisis, a loss for the
year before tax was recorded for all categor-
ies of German banks for the first time since
statistics on performance have been collect-
ed. Although all categories of banks con-
sidered here showed a declining profit for the
financial year, it was notably the institutionsactive in retail business (savings banks, credit
cooperatives and regional banks) that were
able to post a positive result even in a year of
crisis. By contrast, the other categories of
banks – which mostly showed a very marked
decline in their profit for the year, too – re-
corded losses mainly as a result of the dra-
matic rise in valuation charges. The big banks
were especially affected by this, although the
above-mentioned significant one-off effect in
2007 makes a year-on-year comparison sub-
ject to some qualification. In the reporting
year, they recorded a result for the financial
year before tax of - 317.8 billion (compared
with + 315.3 billion). However, losses were
also recorded by the Landesbanken (- 36.1 bil-
lion compared with + 30.8 billion), special
purpose banks (- 33.4 billion compared with
-35.6 billion), mortgage banks (- 32.9 billion
compared with + 30.4 billion), and the region-
al institutions of credit cooperatives (- 3416
billion compared with - 3375 billion), although
the institutions of these categories, like the
big banks, were by no means affected
equally.
Taxes on income and earnings fell from 36.0
billion to 31.3 billion in the reporting year.
Significant tax expenses were recorded main-
ly by those categories of banks that recorded
an aggregate profit for the financial year be-
fore tax, although this was also the case for
the category of Landesbanken, where growth
in this item varied quite considerably among
the individual institutions. Tax expenditures
were offset partly by tax receipts in the case
of the regional institutions of credit coopera-
tives and the big banks, tax expenditure was
offset partly by tax receipts. In both cases, ac-First-ever loss

48cording to the data published in the annual
reports, these receipts were, however, con-
centrated on individual institutions.14The
German banking industry as a whole posted
a loss for the financial year after tax of 326.3
billion, which resulted from the losses made
at the big banks, Landesbanken, mortgage
banks and special purpose banks.
In 2008, losses brought forward had a more
negative impact on the German banking
industry’s annual performance than in 2007;
they amounted on balance to 32.3 billion
compared with 30.8 billion but were concen-
trated almost entirely on mortgage banks and
special purpose banks.15As in 2007, income
from withdrawals from the fund for general
banking risks, at 35.2 billion, also bolstered
the profit; corresponding transfers amounted
to32.1 billion. It was, above all, the category
of big banks as well as some Landesbanken
that were compelled to make use of these re-
sources. Finally, the necessary extensive with-
drawals from reserves and participation rights
capital exceeded the corresponding transfers
by320.6 billion.16Overall, there was a record-
ed balance sheet loss of 34.8 billion in 2008
(compared with a balance sheet profit of
313.2 billion in 2007). This resulted essentially
from losses of special purpose banks and
mortgage banks, however. In the aggregate,
all the other categories of banks considered
here showed a balance sheet profit in the re-
porting period.Outlook
Owing to a marked reduction in financial
market risks, especially at the current end,17a
slight recovery in profitability has been appar-
ent so far for the financial year 2009. This is
revealed, among other things, by the im-
proved trading results of some larger German
banks for which intra-year figures on profit-
ability are available at group level and on an
IRFS basis. This is likely to be due, not least, to
the broad-based financial market stabilisation
measures,18accounting rules that have been
relaxed in the short term, and the extremely
expansionary monetary policy in response to
the escalation of the financial crisis triggered
14According to the data published in the annual report,
this concerned, in the case of the regional institutions of
credit cooperatives, receipts from group tax allocations
and the capitalisation of deferred taxes In 2007, the re-
gional institutions of credit cooperatives already recorded
a tax receipt of 30.6 billion, which was also due to group
tax allocations and corporate income tax credits. Accord-
ing to the data published in the annual report, in the case
of the big banks, this was a matter of tax refunds owing
to the carrying-back of losses subject to taxes and the
formation of net asset-side deferred taxes in connection
with foreign branches.
15According to the data published in the annual reports,
only individual institutions in these categories of banks
posted major losses brought forward.
16Extensive withdrawals to offset the annual losses were
needed mainly by the big banks, some Landesbanken,
some special purpose banks and some mortgage banks.
17The reduction in financial market risks at the current
end is most apparent in terms of a marked recovery on
the international stock markets, perceptible declines in
risk premiums on the corporate bond markets, and a
marked narrowing of spreads on the money markets.
18In Germany alone, roughly 322 billion of recapitalisa-
tion resources (including share acquisition) and a guaran-
tee line of some 3132 billion have been made available
by the Financial Market Stabilisation Fund (SoFFin) since
October 2008. Furthermore, the owners of the Landes-
banken (in particular, the federal states and savings
banks) have likewise granted their institutions recapital-
isation resources and guarantees on a large scale. See

2008, pp 30-31, with regard to the main features of the
stabilisation instruments made available to SoFFin pursu-

Nevertheless, the currently observable effects
of a recovery do not yet point to a sustainedimprovement in profitability for the Germanbanking system as a whole. The range of fig-ures published so far varies widely. Moreover,the risks of further falls in profits in the cur-rent financial year are still to be rated as con-siderable despite the recent recovery in thefinancial markets. Irrespective of the observ-able stabilisation tendencies at the currentend, it is very likely that the sharp decline ininternational economic activity will be reflect-ed with a time lag in a rising number of de-faults in both domestic and internationallending business.
19Unlike in the year under
review, in the current financial year, these in-come risks are likely to become evident for allcategories of banks – ie including institutionsactive in retail business – in the form of highervaluation charges from lending business.
Moreover, the higher cyclical risks in inter-
national lending business due to cyclical fac-tors are likely to be reflected in further de-faults, especially in the case of securitisedassets and, therefore, possibly – also with atime lag – in further write-downs of struc-tured products (ABS, CDO, RMBS, CMBS).

19According to the data of the Federal Statistical Office
(Statistisches Bundesamt), there was already a roughly
10% increase in business insolvencies in Germany be-
tween January and June 2009 compared with the same
period last year. See Statistisches Bundesamt, Press re-
lease No 334 of 9 September 2009, and Unternehmen
und Arbeitsst/C228tten, Insolvenzverfahren, Dezember und
Jahr 2008, Fachserie 2, Reihe 4.1, March 2009 (available
in German only).
20The increased economic risk may possibly also lead to
another rating migration, ie a further downgrading of
ratings of structured products, thus resulting – on ac-
count of the rise in risk-weighted assets – in an increase
in the regulatory capital requirements.
21The Act essentially provides for two “bad bank”
models. In the “special purpose vehicle” (SPV) model,
structured securities can be relocated to SPVs against the
transfer of debt instruments guaranteed by SoFFin. By con-
trast, in the “consolidation” model, not only structured se-
curities but also other risk positions as well as non-strategic
business units can be transferred either to liquidation insti-
tutions ( Abwicklungsanstalten ) under German federal law
within the Financial Market Stabilisation Agency (FMSA) or
to liquidation institutions under federal state law. Further
information on the models may be found on the websites
of the Federal Ministry of Finance (www.bundesfinanz-
ministerium.de) and the FMSA (www.soffin.de), and in
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report, May 2009,
pp 54-57, especially with regard to the account of the SPV
model on the basis of the Federal Government’s Draft Act

50teract the potential asset depreciation risks.22
The extent of the strain on profitability posed
by further write-downs on structured prod-
ucts therefore ultimately depends, not least,
on the banks’ use of the “bad bank” model.
Additional risks in operational business in the
current financial year are likely to stem mainly
from a fall in net commissions received owing
to reduced income opportunities in invest-
ment banking and in asset management ac-
tivities. Despite a steeper yield curve, net
interest received is also likely to be lower on
account of a cyclically induced decline in
earnings prospects and as a result of poten-
tially greater competitive pressure. Possible
cost-side relief might be afforded by lower
administrative spending, especially as a result
of lower staff costs. Nevertheless, such allevi-
ating effects are unlikely to alter the assess-
ment of performance for the financial year
2009 as a whole, which is generally fraughtwith major downside risks. In order to coun-
ter these risks in the interests of a business
policy geared to the objectives of long-term
profitability and stability, any profits gener-
ated at present should therefore be used for
strengthening the capital base and thus to
build up an countercyclical “capital buffer”.23
In the medium term, the outlook for profit-
ability in the German banking sector is likely
to be less positive than in the years before the
crisis owing to potentially higher regulatory
levels of capital and liquidity; in return, how-
ever, German banks are likely to benefit from
greater stability in the financial system in the
long run.
The tables accompanying this article
are printed on pages 52 ff.22Furthermore, unloading problem securities would also
counter potential rating migration effects as the offload-
ing of risky assets would free up regulatory capital.

63Amendments to
the new EU Capital
Requirements Directive
and the Minimum
Requirements for
Risk ManagementJust over two years after the transpos-
ition of the Basel II rules contained in
European Union Directives 2006/48/EC
and 2006/49/EC into national legisla-
tion, these directives have once again
been amended. These amendments in-
clude not only corrections to passages
that had been found in practice to be
unclear but also direct responses to les-
sons learnt from the financial crisis.
The focal point of the rules is large
exposures, the recognition of hybrid
capital components, supervisory co-
operation and crisis management. In
addition, however, extensive technical
changes were made, especially in the
areas of securitisations and liquidity
risk. These rules have to be transposed
into national legislation by 31 October
2010; institutions are required to start
applying these new rules with effect
from 31 December 2010.
In addition, the Minimum Requirements
for Risk Management ( Mindestanfor-
derungen an das Risikomanagement,
hereinafter referred to as MaRisk) were
modified in response to flaws detected
in risk management. Some of these
modifications, involving the treatment
of risk concentrations, requirements to
be fulfilled by stress tests and liquidity
management, and the rules govern-
ing compensation systems, are also a
response to lessons learnt from the
financial crisis. The new MaRisk rules
have to be implemented, in principle,
by the end of this year.

64Amendments to the recast Capital
Requirements Directive of the EU
In April 2008, the European Commission
presented a consultation document outlining
proposals for further amendments to the
Capital Requirements Directive (CRD).1These
were aimed at correcting grey areas that had
been detected even after only one year of
practical implementation in the member
states – the Commission’s work had therefore
not been motivated initially by the financial
crisis. Still, as the consultations went on, ini-
tial lessons from the turmoil in the financial
market were incorporated into the work on
the amended directive. The European Parlia-
ment ratified the new directive on 6 May
2009, and the Council followed suit on
27 July 2009. However, the new directive has
not yet been published in the Official Journal
of the European Union.
The main focus of the new directive is on
large exposures, the recognition of hybrid
capital components, supervisory cooperation
and crisis management. However, a raft of
other technical changes were made, especial-
ly with regard to securitisations and liquidity
risk. In some cases, this could lead to an in-
crease in capital requirements for securitisa-
tions.
Major material amendments to the
directives
Revision of the large exposures rules
The large exposures rules were only selective-
ly amended in the Banking Directive and theCapital Adequacy Directive. However, both
directives required the Commission to present,
by 31 December 2007, a report to the Euro-
pean Parliament and the Council assessing
the functioning of the large exposures rules
and outlining any appropriate proposals to
amend these rules. To prepare the report, the
Commission sent several “Calls for Advice”
to the Committee of European Banking Super-
visors (CEBS), which in March 2008 published
the second part of its advice on the review of
the large exposures rules. This formed the
basis for the revision of the large exposures
provisions by the directive amending the Cap-
ital Requirements Directive.
The aim of the review was to simplify the
large exposures rules while also giving more
prominence to their core objective: that the
solvency of a bank should not be threatened
by the default of a counterparty or group of
connected counterparties. The aim is to miti-
gate this idiosyncratic risk by means of legal
regulations while monitoring other types of
risk concentrations, such as sectoral or re-
gional risk concentrations, under the Super-
visory Review Process which constitutes Pillar 2
of the Basel II framework.
The most radical change in the large expos-
ures regime is that all claims of an institution
on other credit institutions and financial ser-
vices institutions count towards the upper
large exposures limit of 25% of own funds.
However, institutions are exempted from this

65rule up to an absolute amount of 3150 mil-
lion. Nonetheless, the exposure is not permit-ted to exceed the institution’s own fundsunder any circumstances. The Bundesbankopposed tightening large exposures rules forinterbank lending since the effects on themoney market, which had been hit by the fi-nancial crisis, are unforeseeable – and themoney market is of key importance for carry-ing out monetary policy operations effective-ly. Moreover, part of the other capital reliefwas abolished, such as for participations in in-surance companies or liquidity netting in net-works of institutions.
However, in order to maintain the efficiency
of payment and securities settlement for cus-tomers and of correspondent banking, onwhich the former is based, exceptions havebeen made. Overnight loans from this type ofbusiness, or loans granted in correspondentbanking business up until the close of busi-ness, do not count towards the large expos-ures limit. For national groups of institutionsor associations, moreover, the new rules ex-empt intra-group or intra-association transac-tions from counting against the large expos-ures limit.
The large exposures regime was also simpli-
fied. The most prominent simplification wasto abolish the overall upper large exposureslimit of 800% of own funds for the sum totalof all large exposures and the reduced individ-ual large exposures limit of 20% for intra-group lending. The former limit was virtuallyirrelevant in practice and also insufficientlygranular for proper diversification of thecredit portfolio – which is why Pillar 2 is thebetter place for the supervisory monitoring of
the diversification of the credit portfolio.With regard to intra-group lending, specialinternal procedures such as the decision-making requirements for loans to manage-ment pursuant to section 15 of the GermanBanking Act ( Kreditwesengesetz ) are regard-
ed as being better suited to mitigating conta-gion risk from intra-group loans.
Lawmakers sought to align the recognition of
collateral even more closely to the method-ology used to calculate capital requirements.Owing to the protection purposes of thelarge exposures regime, only financial collat-eral is generally recognised, in the light of itshighly liquid nature. Institutions can choosefrom among three procedures to recognisethe collateralisation effects, with methods IIand III already being applied (see section 29of the Large Exposures Regulation ( Großkre-
dit- und Millionenkreditverordnung )). (I) A sub-
stitution approach in which, in the case ofguarantees, the institution recognises theprotection seller or, for securities pledged ascollateral, the issuer of the securities as theborrower instead of the original borrower. (II)The comprehensive collateral approach whichuses “haircuts” and in which the value of col-lateral (which reduces the amount of theclaim and thus mitigates credit risk) is reducedin line with the characteristics of the collat-eral. Institutions may use this approach if theyalso use it in the context of their capital re-quirements. (III) Estimating the financial im-pact of financial collateral on LGD for institu-tions that use the advanced internal modelsapproach for credit risk.

66Another lesson drawn from the crisis was to
specify more clearly the rules governing the
formation of groups of connected clients. The
definition of a group of connected clients
clarifies that refinancing-related risks also
need to be recognised when calculating risk
units. This means that firms dependent on a
single source of refinancing, as was the case
for acquiring entities in ABCP programmes,
have to be organised into groups of connect-
ed clients. Moreover, the Commission made it
clear that unilateral dependency is already
sufficient grounds to require the formation of
a group of connected clients. German admin-
istrative practice, which required mutual de-
pendency based on the grounds given for the
Fifth Act Amending the German Banking Act,
accordingly needs to be abandoned. How-
ever, when examining economic dependency,
sectoral or regional dependency do not need
to be taken into account since sector and re-
gional concentration risks are not to be
covered by the large exposures rules but by
Pillar 2 of Basel II.
Lastly, the new directive requires authorities
to use a uniform reporting format for large
exposures reports from 2013. The directive
stipulates that the credit institution is to iden-
tify the client or group of connected clients
– irrespective of whether or not they are ex-
empt from being counted towards the large
exposures limit – for every large exposure and
to give the type and amount of collateral
posted as well as of credit risk mitigation. In
addition, banks using an Internal Ratings-
Based (IRB) Approach to calculate capital re-
quirements for credit risk are to report their
20 largest exposures to their competent au-thorities. Germany already meets this require-
ment through its reports of loans of 31.5 mil-
lion or more to its credit register.
Inclusion of hybrid capital instruments
The new Article 63a represents the transpos-
ition into European legislation of the “Sydney
Agreement” issued by the Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision in 1998 on the inclu-
sion of hybrid financial instruments – ie those
capital components that combine features of
equity and debt capital – in tier 1 capital. The
provisions in Article 57(a) and recital number 4
of the new directive are designed to draw a
clear distinction between hybrid capital and
the components of “core” tier 1 capital. If a
component of capital is equivalent to ordinary
shares during liquidation and fully absorbs
losses on a going concern basis, it can be fully
included in tier 1 capital. The Bundesbank be-
lieves that the new directive’s “ pari passu
with ordinary shares” requirement for inclu-
sion in core tier 1 capital would not have
been necessary since a proper subordination
agreement is already enough to ensure that
preferred creditors are protected by the
bank’s tier 1 capital. Permanence, loss ab-
sorbency and ability of the issuer to cancel
interest payments are the key conditions for
recognition of hybrid capital, which can now
only be included to a limited degree in tier 1
capital. CEBS was requested to elaborate
more detailed guidelines on these criteria for
inclusion, thereby ensuring maximum conver-
gence of supervisory practice in this area. The
draft implementation guidelines were pub-
lished on 22 June 2009; the consultation
period ends on 23 September 2009.Rules for

67The provision of hybrid capital instruments is
regarded as permanent if they are undated orhave a maturity of at least 30 years. Althoughthe issuer may have a call option, the instru-ments may not be redeemable for at leastfive years after the date of issue. Such a calloption may be combined with an incentivefor the institution to redeem (usually an inter-est rate step-up) only after ten years at theearliest. The competent supervisor may forbidthe redemption of dated instruments at thedate of maturity. Hybrid capital instrumentscan be called or redeemed only with the priorconsent of supervisors; such calls or redemp-tions are not permitted to have any materialimpact on the institution’s solvency. The re-sponsible authorities, moreover, may requirethe institution to replace the capital withequal or higher-quality capital.The nominal amount and undistributed inter-
est or dividends must be available to the insti-tution to absorb losses. To create flexibilityhere and allow room for differences in nation-al practice, the text of the directive does notgo into specifics. The CEBS implementationguidelines, which are currently under consult-ation, describe various ways of absorbinglosses (eg by writing down the principal tothe nominal value, or converting it into higherforms of capital); however, it is ultimatelyup to the competent supervisor to decidewhether it regards the envisaged legal or con-tractual provisions for absorbing losses on ahybrid instrument as being sufficient. More-over, by subordinating investors’ repaymentclaims, the claims of depositors and other se-nior creditors are protected if the issuing insti-tution becomes insolvent.
Deutsche BundesbankRules for recognising hybrid capital instruments *
* Hybrid capital instruments are a hybrid of equity and debt capital and contain both key features of equity (eg 
the investor‘s losses are absorbed) as well as of debt capital (eg investor‘s ﬁ  xed claim on interest). Innovative capi-
tal instruments are hybrid tier 1 capital instruments which have not only a pure call option but also some other feature which might lead to them being redeemed (usually an interest step-up clause). — 1 Directive 2009/.../EC

68In order to preserve a bank’s cash under dur-
ess, the rules governing hybrid financial in-
struments must give the credit institution the
opportunity to cancel coupons or dividend
payments non-cumulatively and indefinitely,
which means that such payments are non-
recoverable. The cancellation of these pay-
ments is mandatory if the institution fails to
meet prudential supervisory requirements. In-
stead of paying the coupons or dividends in
cash, however, the institution can issue new
equity capital shares, the value of which can
then be used to settle outstanding payments.
The CEBS guidelines under consultation con-
tain further guidance on this procedure.
Depending on their structures, hybrid finan-
cial instruments may be included up to a
maximum of 50% of tier 1 capital. Dated in-
struments or instruments containing an in-
centive to redeem may make up a maximum
of 15% of tier 1 capital; undated instruments
with a pure call option can be included up to
35% of tier 1 capital. Those capital instru-
ments which, at the behest of the bank, can
be converted into elements of paid-up capital
pursuant to Article 57(a) of the directive may
constitute up to 50% of tier 1 capital. These
buckets are not additive and cover each re-
spective lower limit.
To avoid disrupting the capital markets, Art-
icle 154 of the amending directive contains a
grandfather clause protecting capital instru-
ments already issued at the time the provi-
sions take effect at the national level. It per-
mits the inclusion of these instruments up
until the year 2040. Such old transactions
may be included in tier 1 capital in full for thefirst ten years after 31 December 2010; in the
20 years thereafter, the bucket for inclusion
will be gradually reduced to 20% and then to
10% of tier 1 capital.
Major technical changes to the directives
Securitisation rules
One of the key changes in the new Capital
Requirements Directive was the insertion of a
new Article 122a which stipulates that a
credit institution, acting as an investor, may
assume an exposure to securitisation risk only
if the originator (or sponsor or original lender)
has confirmed that it will retain at least 5%
of the risk. The quantitative risk is supple-
mented by qualitative requirements, especial-
ly with respect to the risk analysis to be con-
ducted by investor institutions. To enable
such analyses, originators and sponsors are
required to disclose comprehensive informa-
tion to investors about the retained risk and
the data relevant to the securitised portfolio.
In addition, originators and sponsors have to
subject their securitised positions to the same
lending standards and procedures as unse-
curitised loans, otherwise the originator’s risk
transfer will be disallowed. Supervisors can
punish violations of the provisions of Art-
icle 122a by imposing a higher risk weight up
to a maximum of 1,250% on the affected
securitised positions. In addition to these
changes, the conversion factors for qualified
securitised liquidity facilities in the Standard-
ised Approach for credit risk have now been
uniformly set at 50% and the special treat-
ment of market disruption facilities has been
abolished.... and the

69Use of life insurance as credit collateral
The opportunities for recognising life insur-
ance as credit collateral in the StandardisedApproach have been improved. Under the oldregime, life insurance policies could only berecognised as risk mitigants if the insurer hadan external rating of at least A-. In future, therecognition of life insurance will no longer bebased mainly on the credit rating of the in-surer but instead on the quality of the coverfund for life insurance claims. This meansthat, under certain conditions, it is now pos-sible to recognise life insurance provided byfirms that are either unrated or have a poorerexternal rating, thereby considerably increas-ing the range of eligible life insurance. Eventhough the risk weights for claims collateral-ised by life insurance have been reduced inpart, the Bundesbank believes that the recog-nition of life insurance as credit collateral isstill relatively rigid.
Treatment of mutual fund shares/units in the
IRB Approach
The treatment of mutual fund shares/units
in the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) Approachhas likewise been changed. When determin-ing the risk weights for mutual fund shares/units in a look-through approach, assets thatare not assigned to the exposure class “equityclaims” will be recognised in future at amodified weighting rate. If a mutual fund in-vests mainly in high-quality debt securities,this could lead to considerable relief com-pared with the previous regime.Treatment of liquidity risk
In response to the vulnerability of many insti-
tutions in terms of refinancing exposed bythe financial crisis, the hitherto more cursoryliquidity rules have been made more specificin Annexes V and XI of the Banking Directive.This represents the transposition into Euro-pean law of the key elements of the BaselCommittee’s “Principles for Sound LiquidityRisk Management and Supervision”, whichhad already been revised in September 2008.The new liquidity rules explain banks’ internalliquidity management tasks and tools andemphasise their particular systemic relevance.In contrast to solvency supervision, the under-lying approach is based less on probabilitiesand more on the potential impact of stress.Accordingly, the simulation of severe liquidityshocks and the subsequent contingency plan-ning and quantitative liquidity provisioningwill play a key role. As before, liquidity super-vision, including that of cross-border institu-tions, will remain largely in the hands ofnational supervisors; in liquidity supervisionthere is no “consolidating supervisor” similarto that in capital supervision. Liquidity super-vision within Europe thus remains an area ofsupervisory law with little convergence.
Supervisory cooperationThe proposed amendments to the Banking
Directive are also intended to expand coopera-tion among banking supervisors under nor-mal circumstances and in times of crisis.
The competent national supervisors are being
expressly called upon for the first time to duly

70consider the potential effect of their decisions
on the stability of the financial system in all
other EU member states concerned when ex-
ercising their general duties and especially
in emergency situations (Article 40 (3)). How-
ever, the introduction of such a “Community
dimension” is not to be understood as bind-
ing supervisors to specific actions or specific
results but rather as a broad and general ob-
jective.
The inclusion of rules governing the establish-
ment of “supervisory colleges” represents the
entry into the Banking Directive of a further
key element of international cooperation.
These colleges are designed for cross-border
groups of institutions in the EU; some are al-
ready in existence while others have yet to be
established. All host country supervisors hold
a meeting headed by the home supervisor or
“consolidating supervisor” in what is known
as a “general college”. There are currently
three such colleges in Germany under Ger-
man management. The home supervisor may
also limit the number of participants to the
supervisors of countries of particular rele-
vance (“core college”). Supervisory colleges
are intended to enhance the effectiveness
of cooperation between national supervisory
authorities in the supervision of cross-border
credit institutions (Article 131a). To this end,
participating supervisors are to exchange rele-
vant information from the various EU mem-
ber states in which the group of institutions is
active, aggregate it into a joint risk assess-
ment and determine supervisory examination
programmes based on the risk assessment of
the group. In addition, duplication of super-
visory requirements is to be eliminated andconsistent application of the supervisory re-
quirements by colleges ensured. Moreover,
the participating supervisors may also agree
on the voluntary delegation of tasks and re-
sponsibilities in order to enhance the effi-
ciency of their work.
The details concerning the establishment and
functioning of supervisory colleges are regu-
lated by written coordination and cooper-
ation agreements formulated by the “consoli-
dating supervisor” after consulting all compe-
tent supervisory authorities (Article 131a (2)).
To avoid inconsistency and regulatory arbi-
trage, CEBS has been asked to develop
guidelines for the practical functioning of
the operations of supervisory colleges (Art-
icle 131a (2)). Moreover, in a dispute between
members of a supervisory college, CEBS can
be consulted as a neutral and independent
conflict-resolving mediator (Article 129 (3)).
The newly added Article 42b also strengthens
the role of CEBS; this article stipulates that
the competent national supervisory author-
ities should contribute to the convergence of
supervisory instruments and procedures in
the EU when fulfilling their tasks. For this pur-
pose, the CEBS guidelines, recommendations,
standards and other measures should be fol-
lowed, and reasons stated if they are not fol-
lowed (the “comply or explain” procedure
pursuant to Article 42b (1) b).
The new Banking Directive has strengthened
the role of the “consolidating supervisor” by
giving it the authority, in the areas of Articles
123 and 124 (capital adequacy) and Art-
icle 136 (2) (additional capital charges) to
make the final decision on a consolidated... introducing a

71basis if the competent supervisors are unable
to reach a joint decision within four months(Article 129 (3)).
Lastly, the amending directive places the ex-
change of information between the compe-tent national supervisors on a broader basis.Now, in cases of a crisis with implications forthe stability of the financial system, centralbanks and finance ministries are explicitly in-volved in an exchange of information (Articles49 and 50). In addition, the new directivefundamentally strengthens the right of hostcountry supervisors to obtain information on“significant” (ie systemically relevant) branches(Article 42a). The home and host supervisorsare to jointly decide within two monthswhether a branch is significant. If no agree-ment can be reached, the decision is taken bythe branch’s host supervisor. This involvementof host country supervisors of legally depend-ent units is very far-reaching and, in and of it-self, is not consistent with the principle ofhome country supervision of foreign branchescurrently valid in the EU.
On the whole, the strengthening of the pos-
ition of the consolidating supervisor as thehead of the supervisory colleges is an import-ant step towards more stringent supervisionwhich at the same time relieves the burdenon institutions. The establishment of supervis-ory colleges takes due account of the specificcircumstances of the European banking andfinancial market. The use of supervisory col-leges as instruments of ongoing supervisionand crisis prevention and also as a supportingmeasure in crisis management is to be viewedpositively and regarded as a key step towardsimproving the European supervisory frame-
work.
Further changes with regard to supervisory
cooperation are in the pipeline for the com-ing year: the Council of Heads of State orGovernment came to an agreement in June2009 to establish a “European System of Fi-nancial Supervisors” by the end of 2010.
OutlookFurther changes in the European framework
for prudential supervision are currently beingplanned for the foreseeable future (CRD 3and CRD 4). Key elements of CRD 3 include arevision of the rules on securitisation and thetrading book. The new CRD also addressescompensation policies. It is currently beingnegotiated by the Council of Ministers. Trans-position into national legislation (together withthe current amended version of the CapitalRequirements Directive) is scheduled for com-pletion by end-2010.
In CRD 4, which is currently undergoing con-
sultation with market participants, the Euro-pean Commission is proposing additionalcapital requirements for residential propertyloans denominated in foreign currency. Inaddition, national options for mortgage lend-ing (in domestic currency) will be tightened.Other contents of this amendment includethrough-the-cycle expected loss provisioningand the introduction of a leverage ratio.There is no definite date yet as to when theCommission will submit a concrete proposalfor a draft directive.

Adjustments to MaRisk
Banking supervisors reacted to deficiencies
in credit institutions’ risk management re-
vealed by the financial crisis by making ad-
justments to the Minimum Requirements for
Risk Management ( Mindestanforderungen an
das Risikomanagement , hereinafter MaRisk).
For example, institutions had not taken ad-
equate account of all major risks, especially
such risks that had been shifted to off-
balance-sheet special-purpose vehicles (SPVs).
Blindly focusing on external rating results
drew attention away from the actual risks;
the backward-looking orientation of risk
measurement led to the understatement of
risk; and compensation systems were exces-
sively oriented to short-term success. In some
cases, the processes for managing risk con-
centrations and liquidity risk were inad-
equate as well. Supervisors, learning from
these weaknesses and following international
standards set by Basel, the EU and the G20,
defined certain elements of the MaRisk more
clearly and made extensions to these rules.
Other changes to MaRisk were made on the
basis of experience obtained from ongoing
supervisory practice and from incidents of
fraud in some banks’ trading business.Capital adequacy assessment
The MaRisk now emphasise more clearly that
institutions are required to establish a process
to ensure capital adequacy on an ongoing
basis. Elements of such a process include
regular analysis of the risk profile, stress test-
ing, updating the available risk-taking poten-
tial, regularly updated capital planning, the
internal limit system, the establishment and
pursuit of strategies and the internal report-
ing system. Supervisors are well aware that
not all institutions already have the requisite
sound mathematical processes or sufficient
time series to quantify all material risks. In-
stead of therefore excluding these risks from
the capital adequacy assessment altogether, a
qualified expert assessment is necessary in
order to obtain a meaningful assessment of
the respective risks which can be verified by
supervisors.
Risk concentrations
In giving greater emphasis to proper manage-
ment of risk concentrations, the MaRisk were
adapted in the light of the insight that hidden
– and therefore beyond the reach of risk
management – risk concentrations can be a
key cause of banks’ difficulties. Logically, the
MaRisk now clearly state that management
needs to inform itself not just of the material
risks to the institution but also about the con-
comitant risk concentrations. As for the risk
concentrations associated with credit risk, the
MaRisk now state clearly that not only quali-
tative procedures but also – where possible –
quantitative procedures are necessary. These
must cover counterparty and sector concen-Deficiencies

73trations, regional concentrations and other
concentrations which can lead to consider-able losses relative to the risk-taking poten-tial.
Stress testsStress tests are necessary to detect an institu-
tion’s vulnerability to losses even under ex-treme circumstances. They are an importantcomplement to risk analysis using mathemat-ical and statistical models since these only en-able a limited reflection of reality and also areoften based on historically observed assump-tions and interdependencies. The reliability ofthese models for predicting the future is fun-damentally limited, all the more so in times ofdynamic change such as in a financial crisis.Institutions are required to develop meaning-ful stress tests in order to increase their sensi-tivity to situations that to them could be crit-ical and, in this manner, to obtain the neces-sary risk management stimuli. The Bundes-bank’s prudential on-site inspections haverevealed that some institutions have notattached enough importance to their stresstests in terms of risk management. That wasanother reason why it made sense to specifyin more detail the requirements with regardto adequate stress testing.
Stress tests comprise sensitivity analyses in
which only one risk factor is varied and scen-ario analyses in which several or even all riskfactors are varied simultaneously in order tosimulate the impacts of predefined events. Itis necessary to use not only historical eventsbut also hypothetical events so that stresstests can also simulate exceptional but plaus-ible events – so much the more if historical
data do not represent a sufficiently broad var-iety of material risk factors across an ad-equate time horizon, which would mean thatpreviously unobserved yet possible eventscould not be derived from the time seriesalone. Looking only at historical develop-ments, moreover, especially after long periodsof stability, can make the observer unawareof their abrupt end or of a trend reversal. For

74management to be able to put the results of
the stress test into the proper perspective, the
risk report needs to present not only the po-
tential impact of the assumed scenarios on
the risk situation but the material assump-
tions underlying the stress tests in a verifiable
and meaningful manner.
Given the highly heterogeneous nature of the
institutions, it does not make sense for super-
visors to impose one-size-fits-all stress tests.
The MaRisk have therefore deliberately reject-
ed standardised stress tests, instead leaving it
up to each individual institution to design
tests that take due account of their individual
situations. The requirement that the results of
the stress test also be incorporated into the
assessment of capital adequacy was newly
added to the MaRisk. However, even the pre-
vious version of MaRisk had required that it
be possible for the institution’s material risks
to be covered on an ongoing basis by the
institution’s risk-taking potential. It is there-
fore only logical to call on institutions to re-
view regularly whether or not and to what
extent they can bear risk even under stress.
Liquidity risk
The financial crisis has made clear just how
important it is for credit institutions to proper-
ly manage their liquidity risk. With this in
mind, the liquidity management requirements
in the MaRisk were more clearly defined and
complemented to incorporate the changes to
the liquidity requirements in the Banking Dir-
ective. In particular, the success of liquidity
risk management even in a difficult situation
hinges on institutions being properly pre-pared for a deterioration in the liquidity situ-
ation, which is why the relevant requirements
in the MaRisk were expanded. Institutions are
now required to recognise an impending li-
quidity bottleneck at an early stage while also
taking into account the impact of other risks,
such as reputational risk, on the liquidity situ-
ation.
The MaRisk now place particular emphasis
on the importance of institutions’ individual
stress tests to detect potential liquidity diffi-
culties. Institutions are required to regularly
perform adequate stress tests over varying
time horizons so that they are prepared for
unforeseen developments which could be
caused by either endogenous or market-wide
factors.
Each institution, taking the results of its own
stress tests into account, is required to draft a
contingency plan for liquidity shortfalls and
review the planned measures regularly for
feasibility. Continuous and permanent access
to the relevant sources of refinance also
needs to be reviewed. For short-term liquidity
gaps, an institution has to hold a sufficient
supply of sustainable liquidity reserves, such
as highly liquid, unencumbered assets. The in-
stitution must also establish the extent to
which any remaining restrictions exist on the
transfer of liquid funds and assets within a
group.
Contingency planning aspects were added to
the liquidity risk reporting requirements.

75have to be reported to senior management.
Special attention is to be given to liquidity riskfrom off-balance-sheet business.
Interest rate risk in the banking bookThe part of the MaRisk explanatory notes
covering interest rate risk in the trading bookwas amended so that now undated equitycapital components may not be included inthe present-value calculation of interest raterisk. This makes it clear that the function ofequity capital as an unlimited risk-takingpotential is incompatible with the assumptionof a maturity when determining the interestrate risk position.
Group-level risk managementIn order to enhance the stature of group-level
risk management and to specify what re-quirements superordinated enterprises pursu-ant to section 25a (1a) of the German Bank-ing Act ( Kreditwesengesetz ) have to meet,
the existing group risk management require-ments were supplemented and transferred toa module of their own. Each superordinatedenterprise, in coordination with its subordin-ated enterprises, is required to ensure compli-ance with the rules governing strategies, cap-ital adequacy, risk management and controlprocesses, organisation of operations and in-ternal audit within the group. The decision onwhich risks to include in risk control hingeson their economic materiality rather thanwhether or not they are part of the supervis-ory consolidation definition. Consequently,special-purpose vehicles which do not fallwithin the consolidation definition must, forinstance, also be included in consolidated
group-wide risk management depending ontheir riskiness.
Compensation practicesThe compensation schemes at some institu-
tions offered their staff, in the past, an incen-tive to take excessive risk, thus contributingdecisively to the current crisis. With this inmind, new rules governing incentive andcompensation practices were added to theMaRisk which go far beyond the previousdemand that incentive and compensationschemes be consistent with strategic aims.
The new requirements are based on the re-
spective principles for sound compensationpractices issued by the Financial Stability Board(FSB) and CEBS. Compensation schemes haveto avoid incentives to incur excessive risk.Variable compensation for senior manage-ment and staff members that are in a positionto enter large risk positions should take intoaccount not only their individual contributionto profit but also the contribution made bythe organisational unit and the overall profit-ability of the institution. Moreover, a timehorizon for assessing and paying out variablecompensation should be chosen which islarge enough to ensure that future negativedevelopments are also properly taken into ac-count.
The new requirements are not intended to
serve as detailed prescriptions which regi-ment compensation policy or even set abso-lute figures for compensation in banks. In-stead, they are conceived as fundamental

77principles that can be implemented flexibly in
order to bring the incentive impacts of banks’
compensation structures much more in line
with their sustainable development.
Technology and organisational measures
A new requirement for assigning IT authori-
sations was inserted into the MaRisk in
response to cases of fraudulent activity at
some institutions’ trading desks. Now, staff
may, as a general rule, only be assigned the
rights they actually need for their activities
(principle of minimum authorisation).
Organisational and operational structure
of lending business
The part of the MaRisk explanatory notes
covering process-related principles was amend-
ed to stipulate that such principles also be
formulated for business with hedge funds
and private equity firms. Institutions are thus
required to develop processes for these types
of business covering, in particular, the provi-
sion of financial and other information, an
analysis of the purpose and structure of the
transaction to be financed, the quality and
availability of collateral and an analysis of re-
payment capability.
The MaRisk previously allowed institutions to
rely solely on external sources when assessing
counterparty credit risk (CCR). The current
version of the MaRisk, by contrast, makes a
point of stating that the exclusive use of ex-
ternal credit ratings is no longer a sufficient
basis for a lending decision.Organisational and operational structure
of trading business
The requirements for processes in trading
business were amended to include a rule stat-
ing that also internal transactions, such as
trading business between branches or organ-
isational units within the same firm, can only
be conducted on the basis of clear rules. A
definition of internal transactions was added,
as well as a note that, in principle, only stand-
ard form contracts be used. Other amend-
ments cover trade settlement and review,
which is now to be performed electronically
as a rule, using existing settlement systems.
In those cases in which no counter-
confirmation can be obtained for overseas
business, the institution must find another
suitable way to confirm the existence of the
transaction. In the confirmation and coordin-
ation procedure, the institution should pay
particular attention to a preponderance of
cancellations or corrections affecting certain
staff members or certain transactions. Institu-
tions have to be in a position to verify the ex-
istence and the content of trading business in
order to detect and prevent fraud early on.
Entry into force
The amended EU directive will be transposed
into German legislation by adapting the pro-
visions of the German Banking Act and the
more concrete rules in the Solvency Regula-
tion and the Large Exposures Regulation. The
EU directive requires the amended national
legal regulations to enter into force by 31 Oc-Restricted IT

78tober 2010 and to be applied by institu-
tions beginning on 31 December 2010. Given
the relatively tight timeframe, work on imple-
mentation has already begun; in a time-
tested procedure, the banking industry (in the
form of specific expert panels) and the bank-
ing supervision working group have already
been brought on board at an early stage.
The implementation process is also scheduled
to include additional planned changes to the
Banking and Capital Adequacy Directives
which will likewise take effect on 31 Decem-
ber 2010. These include, above all, improve-
ments in market risk rules for the trading
book, higher capital requirements for re-
securitisations and new principles for com-
pensation. The European Commission already
presented a draft directive containing these
amendments in July 2009. In a further step,new rules for additional risk provisioning to
mitigate procyclicality are to be prescribed,
and the number of national options and dis-
cretions reduced as much as possible. The
Commission has announced that it will
present a draft directive in October 2009.
In principle, the new MaRisk have to be im-
plemented by 31 December 2009. However,
if the implementation of the requirements
leads to difficulties that are not the fault of
the institutions, supervisors will refrain from
taking prudential supervisory actions until
31 December 2010. It is, not least, the cur-
rent financial crisis which has encouraged
supervisors, in the supervisory process, to pay
particular attention to ensuring that institu-
tions independently and responsibly imple-
ment the revised Minimum Requirements for
