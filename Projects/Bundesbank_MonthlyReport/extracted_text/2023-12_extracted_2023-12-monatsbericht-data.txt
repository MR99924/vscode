Economic conditions
Underlying trends
Real gross domestic product (GDP) in Germany 
is likely to decline again slightly in the fourth 
quarter of 2023, mainly on account of the 
slowdown in industry and construction. Both 
sectors had a weak start to the quarter, with 
output in October significantly lower than the 
average over the three months preceding. They 
continue to suffer from weak demand. Order 
backlogs are acting as less and less of a buffer. 
Industrial output is also being depressed by the 
previous rise in energy prices. Higher financing 
costs continue to dampen investment, particu -
larly in housing construction. On average across 
all sectors, firms assessed their business situ -
ation averaged over October and November to 
be somewhat worse still than in the previous 
quarter, according to the ifo Institute. By con -
trast, private consumption is likely to be re -
covering slowly. In October, for example, 
households increased their spending in the re -
tail sector and on motor vehicles. Their real dis -
posable income is currently improving as wages 
continue to rise steeply and inflation moder -
ates. The stable labour market is underpinning 
this development. At the beginning of next 
year, the German economy is likely to see slight 
growth again.1
Industry
At the beginning of the current quarter, indus -
try was still in the midst of a weak spell. It con -
tinues to navigate a difficult competitive envir -
onment and is struggling with the conse -
quences of the probably permanent increase in 
energy costs in Germany. On top of this, de -
mand remains sluggish and order backlogs are 
dwindling. This is reflected in industrial output, 
which after seasonal adjustment was down 
somewhat in October compared with Septem -ber, and was well below the third- quarter 
level.2 The decline was broadly based across 
sectors. For November, the German Association 
of the Automotive Industry (VDA) reported a 
stable number of motor vehicles produced. In -
dustry as a whole is seeing the first tentative 
signs of an imminent recovery in export busi -
ness. Export expectations as surveyed by the ifo 
Institute improved again. Business expectations 
were also somewhat less pessimistic, and pro -
duction plans at least showed no further de -
terioration. In October, industrial new orders 
from the domestic market and abroad fell for 
another month in succession across all sectors. 
However, excluding large orders, which fluctu -
ate strongly and also generally do not have a 
direct impact on output, new orders from 
abroad have been fairly stable in recent months. 
In October, they increased slightly on the quar -
ter at a low level. Domestic orders were some -
what down on the quarter, by contrast. This 
was mainly due to significantly lower new 
orders for capital goods. The subdued domes -
tic propensity to invest is likely to reflect not 
only weak industrial activity but also higher 
financing costs. Greater uncertainty about fu -
ture fiscal and climate policy following the rul -
ing by the Federal Constitutional Court on the 
second supplementary budget for 2021 could 
create additional headwinds.
Private consumption and 
service  providers
Private consumption is likely to slowly embark 
on a recovery path in the current quarter, thus 
supporting the consumption- related services 
sector. In the retail sector, price and seasonally 
adjusted sales in October were significantly German eco -
nomic output 
likely to dip

higher on both the month and the quarter. The 
increase was fairly broad- based across seg -
ments. According to ifo Institute surveys, as -
sessments of the current situation in the retail 
sector have also improved recently, even 
though they remained largely pessimistic. In 
the accommodation and food services sector, 
by contrast, the assessments deteriorated 
somewhat. In both of these consumption-  
related services sectors, expectations for the 
next six months brightened slightly averaged 
over October and November compared with 
the previous quarter. Household car purchases 
also increased, as indicated by data on new 
passenger car registrations, which are provided 
by the German Association of the Automotive 
Industry and available up to November. For 
most business- related service providers, includ -
ing wholesale trade, the assessment of the cur -
rent situation brightened somewhat in Novem -
ber. Overall, the services sector (excluding 
trade) is likely to remain relatively robust in the 
current quarter. Averaged over October and 
November, enterprises assessed their business 
situation to be the same as in the third quarter, 
according to the ifo Institute. The S&P Global 
Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the ser -
vices sector remained below the average of the 
previous quarter and also a little below the ex -
pansion threshold, but improved slightly in No -
vember.
Labour market
Employment has seen slightly positive develop -
ments recently despite the ongoing cyclical 
weakness. In October, the number of persons 
in employment increased by a seasonally ad -
justed 15,000 compared with September, after 
having stagnated in the summer months. As re -
gards employment subject to social security 
contributions – for which the Federal Employ -
ment Agency’s initial estimates reach up to 
September – additional jobs were filled mainly 
in human health and social work and in the 
public sector. Neither of these sectors face cyc -
lical fluctuations in demand, though. Employ -Slight employ -

ment declined significantly in wholesale and 
retail trade and in temporary agency work, 
however. The latter often serves as an adjust -
ment reserve in industry. By contrast, the manu -
facturing and construction sectors were more 
or less able to retain their core staff. The num -
ber of employees affected by short- time work 
for economic reasons rose again markedly in 
September after the end of the summer holi -
days. However, short- time work continues to 
play a minor role in the economy as a whole. 
Leading indicators of employment remained 
stable in November. The ifo employment bar -
ometer for trade and industry is showing signs 
of bottoming out in slightly negative territory, 
while the outlook for the economy as a whole 
remains neutral.
Registered unemployment went up in Novem -
ber by a seasonally adjusted 22,000 persons to 
2.70 million, having already risen distinctly in 
October. The unemployment rate climbed to 
5.9%. The slight increase in employment was 
not enough to fully absorb the high number of 
immigrants – many of whom are refugees – at 
present. That said, cyclical factors likewise 
played a role. The number of benefit recipients 
under the statutory unemployment insurance 
scheme increased somewhat. Unemployment 
is set to rise further over the next three months 
as well according to the unemployment bar -
ometer of the Institute for Employment Re -
search.
Commodity prices
Commodity prices for energy have come down 
significantly of late. As this report went to 
press, a barrel of Brent crude oil cost US$74, 
just under 20% less than in October. Concerns 
about future oil demand had a dampening ef -
fect on prices. In addition, fears that the con -
flict in the Middle East could spread to other 
regions receded. Market participants also had 
doubts about whether further production cuts 
by some OPEC countries and their partners will 
be fully implemented. European gas and elec -tricity prices saw a marked drop as well, prob -
ably due to stable gas deliveries to Europe, fa -
vourable weather conditions overall and well-  
stocked European gas storage facilities.
Inflation rate
Prices at the upstream stages of the economy 
changed only marginally in October. While pro -
ducer prices remained unchanged on the 
month in seasonally adjusted terms, import 
prices rose only slightly by 0.4%. Nevertheless, 
prices at the upstream stages were significantly 
lower than their prior- year level overall, but less 
so than in August and September. Prices of im -
ports were down by 13% on the year, and of 
domestic industrial products by 11%. This de -
cline is mainly attributable to lower energy 
prices. Taking the latter out of the equation, 
import prices fell by 3.5% and industrial produ -
cer prices rose by 0.5%.
The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices 
(HICP) continued to fall in November. At 0.2%, 
the seasonally adjusted month- on- month de -
cline in prices was just as strong as in October. 
Energy prices saw another distinct drop, as did 
services prices. However, the latter was mainly 
down to volatile travel services. Prices for in -
dustrial goods remained unchanged, while 
food became significantly more expensive 
again. HICP inflation came down considerably 
year on year, from 3.0% in October to 2.3% in 
November.3 As in previous months, this was 
partly due to the base effect stemming from 
the significant inflation one year ago. The core 
rate (HICP excluding energy and food) also 
dropped, to 3.5%. (October: 4.2%).
Inflation is expected to climb to around 4% 
again in December, however. This is because of Unemployment

3 The annual rate of consumer inflation according to the 
national consumer price index (CPI) declined from 3.8% to 
3.2%. The differences between the national CPI and the 
HICP rates are mainly due to the lower share of energy in 
the CPI. Declining energy prices are thus having less of an 
impact in the CPI.Deutsche Bundesbank

the immediate government assistance for gas 
and district heating payments granted as a 
one- off in December 2022. Twelve months on, 
this has given rise to a temporary price- driving 
base effect. At the beginning of 2024, too, 
when this base effect is eliminated, inflation 
will probably be higher than in November. The 
increase in the carbon price for fossil fuels is 
likely to be a contributing factor in this. Price 
pressures in the services sector remain elevated 
amidst substantial wage growth.
Public finances4
Statutory health insurance 
scheme
The statutory health insurance (SHI) scheme 
(comprising the health insurance institutions 
and the health fund) posted a deficit of €1½ bil -
lion in the third quarter (third quarter of 2022: 
surplus of €½ billion). The bulk of the deficit 
was attributable to the health fund. According 
to current legislation, health insurance institu -
tions and the health fund are required to use 
reserves this year to limit the increase in aver -
age supplementary contribution rates.
SHI scheme revenue remained virtually un -
changed on the same quarter of the previous 
year. Contribution receipts experienced con -
tinued strong growth (6%). One percentage 
point of this is due to the fact that supplemen -
tary contribution rates rose by just under 
0.2  percentage point on average to 1.5%. 
However, compared with the same quarter of 
the previous year, central government spent 
significantly less on the health fund on balance:
– Central government’s special funds to stabil -
ise contributions were reduced significantly 
(down by €3 billion to €½ billion).
– Owing to the fact that pandemic- related 
payments have effectively ceased, the re -
funds of these (just over €2½ billion) were 
now absent.– Meanwhile, central government provided 
additional funds to hospitals to ease the bur -
den of high energy costs (+€1 billion).
SHI scheme expenditure was 2½% higher than 
in the same quarter of the previous year. Lower 
special payments from the health fund to ser -
vice providers had a net dampening effect: 
while the fund passed on the new energy crisis- 
related funds for hospitals, larger pandemic-  
related payments were then no longer made. 
Meanwhile, health insurance institutions’ ex -
penditure on benefits rose sharply (+6%). 
Spending on hospital treatment, a particularly 
large expenditure item, grew by 7%. Payments 
for remedies and therapeutic appliances and 
for dental treatment increased even more 
steeply (+11% and +10%, respectively). Growth 
in outlays for medical treatment and pharma -
ceuticals, meanwhile, was below average (+1% 
and +2½%, respectively). This meant that in -
creases were markedly lower than in the past; 
in the latter case, this was due in part to vari -
ous expenditure- reducing measures.
The SHI scheme will probably post a marked 
deficit for 2023 as a whole. While contribution 
receipts are up sharply on the year, the add -
itional central government funds to stabilise 
contributions are down considerably, decreas -
ing by just over €11 billion. Moreover, expend -
iture on benefits is recording strong growth. In 
the first three quarters, it went up by 5½%. If 
revenue and expenditure increases continue at 
a similar pace in the final quarter, the SHI 
scheme will have a deficit of around €3 billion 
for the year as a whole. The outturn would 
thus be considerably less favourable than ex -
pected based on the assumptions made by the … but likely to

group of SHI estimators in autumn 2023 (def -
icit of €1½ billion).5
Based on the assumptions made by the group 
of SHI estimators in autumn 2023, the SHI 
scheme is expected to post a significant deficit 
of €4 billion in 2024. This will be entirely due to 
health fund expenditure. It will transfer funds 
of just over €2½ billion from its reserve to the 
health insurance institutions so that they do 
not need to raise their supplementary contribu -
tion rates more than necessary. Moreover, the 
health insurance institutions will receive €½ bil -
lion from this reserve for improvements in the 
areas of obstetrics and paediatrics. Finally, the 
health fund will pay €1 billion from its liquidity 
reserve to the Innovation and Structural Fund.6
Looking at the health insurance institutions, the 
group of SHI estimators expects a larger short -
fall than in 2023, putting pressure on the sup -
plementary contribution rate. Expenditure will 
be up by 6% on the projected annual result 
for  2023. This is likely to be due, amongst 
other things, to lagged inflationary effects on 
service charges. Based on the assumptions, 
contribution-based revenue (excluding supple -
mentary contributions) will increase sharply 
(+5½%), but not by quite as much as expend -
iture. In addition, reduced funds from central 
government and from the reserves of the 
health fund and the health insurance institu -
tions will cause the shortfall to expand further. 
Accordingly, the Federal Ministry of Health 
raised the calculated supplementary contribu -
tion rate to 1.7% for 2024; at present, the ac -
tual rate charged by the health insurance insti -
tutions is 1.5% on average.
The health insurance institutions set their sup -
plementary contribution rates individually. In 
doing so, they take into account their own 
financial situation, including any reserves. If 
they make use of these, it results in a deficit. It 
would be advisable for health insurance institu -
tions with more sizeable reserves to use these 
first in order to limit an increase in their supple -
mentary contribution rates.Public long- term care

third quarter of 2023.7 This constituted a year- 
on- year improvement of €2½ billion. Relief was 
provided by two main factors. At mid- year, the 
contribution rate rose by 0.35 percentage point 
to 3.4%.8 This generated additional revenue of 
€1½ billion. Furthermore, coronavirus- related 
expenditure was now largely absent (-€1½ bil -
lion).
Total receipts went up by 14%. Contribution re -
ceipts increased at a somewhat faster pace. 
Adjusted for the higher contribution rate, re -
ceipts were up by around 5%. Last year’s spe -
cial grants from central government were now 
largely absent (-€½ billion).The long- term care insurance scheme’s regular 
expenditure on benefits (excluding pandemic-  
related payments) continued to rise sharply, 
climbing by 10%. This increase is much stronger 
than that of the contribution base. Expenditure 
on inpatient care, in particular, saw continued 
strong growth (+11%). Cash benefits also ex -
panded sharply (+9%), with benefit rates un -
changed. By contrast, pandemic- related pay -
ments were now absent (-€1½ billion). In add -
ition, transfers to the long- term care provident 
fund have been deferred to 2024 (-€½ billion). 
Overall, expenditure thus fell by 3½%.
A marked surplus is on the cards for 2023 as a 
whole, following a deficit of just over €2 billion 
in the previous year. The long- term care insur -
ance scheme had already recorded a small sur -
plus after the first three quarters, and the relief 
provided by the increase in the contribution 
rate and the deferred transfer to the long- term 
care provident fund will continue into the final 
quarter. The fourth quarter usually closes out 
the most favourably because special payments 
boost the contribution base.
A surplus on the same scale as in 2023 could 
be recorded again next year. Core expenditure 
is likely to see further strong growth, due in 
part to benefit expansions and adjustments. In 
addition, the long- term care insurance scheme 
will catch up on the transfers to the long- term 
care provident fund from 2023. However, rev -
enue will also rise sharply on account of the 
higher contribution rates: revenue is expected 
to be up by just over €3 billion on 2023. Ac -Surplus in Q3

7 This refers to the core area, i.e. excluding the long- term 
care provident fund. In most years since 2015, this fund has 
received transfers from the core area corresponding to re -
ceipts of 0.1 percentage point of the contribution rate ap -
plicable in that year. Assets accumulated in this way are to 
be depleted in the 2030s to dampen the expected rise in 
the contribution rate.
8 This contribution rate now applies to persons subject to 
contributions who have one child. There is a higher contri -
bution rate for childless persons, which was raised more 
sharply, to 4%. The contribution rate for insurees with a 
particularly large number of children (five or more children 
under the age of 25) was lowered to 2.4%. For more infor -
mation on this and other elements of the legislative 
amendment, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2023b).Deutsche Bundesbank

cording to current plans, the regular transfer to 
the long- term care provident fund will be re -
duced by €1 billion and, in return, the annual 
central government grant of €1 billion will be 
cancelled.
The further dynamic adjustment of benefits 
and, increasingly, demographic developments 
will put pressure on the long- term care insur -
ance scheme’s finances in the years to come. If 
constantly rising contribution rates are to be 
prevented, comprehensive reform will be 
needed. The Federal Ministry of Health intends 
to present proposals on this matter by the end 
of May 2024.
Securities markets
Bond market
At €129.2 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in October 2023 was down mark -
edly on the previous month (€150.4 billion). 
After deducting redemptions, which were 
somewhat higher than in September, and tak -
ing account of changes in issuers’ holdings of 
their own debt securities, net redemptions of 
domestic debt securities came to €20.3 billion. 
The outstanding volume of foreign debt secur -
ities in Germany declined by €3.2 billion during 
the reporting month, which meant that the 
outstanding volume of debt instruments in the 
German market decreased by €23.5 billion 
overall.
In October, domestic enterprises redeemed 
bonds worth a net €11.3 billion, following net 
issuance amounting to €6.5 billion in the previ -
ous month. Overall, this was almost entirely at -
tributable to other financial institutions, which 
on balance solely redeemed bonds with matur -
ities of up to one year.
During the reporting month, the public sector 
pared back its capital market debt by €10.1 bil -
lion net (following net issuance of €16.9 billion 
in September). On balance, central government principally redeemed five- year Federal notes 
(Bobls; -€13.3 billion) and Treasury discount 
paper (Bubills; -€6.3 billion). This contrasted 
with net issuance of two- year Federal Treasury 
notes (Schätze; €4.6 billion) and 10- year Fed -
eral bonds (Bunds; €4.1 billion). State and local 
governments issued bonds worth €0.4 billion 
net.
Domestic credit institutions raised their capital 
market debt by €1.0 billion in the reporting 
month, following net redemptions of €7.1 bil -
lion in the previous month. In this context, the 
outstanding volume of other bank debt secur -
ities that can be structured flexibly and public 
Pfandbriefe increased by €2.5 billion and €1.9 
billion, respectively. By contrast, mortgage 
Pfandbriefe and debt securities issued by spe -
cialised credit institutions, which include public 
promotional banks, were redeemed in net 
terms for €2.0 billion and €1.4 billion respect -

On the buyers’ side, all categories of buyer off -
loaded bonds on balance in the reporting 
month. Non- resident investors trimmed their 
holdings of domestic bonds by €8.3 billion net. 
Holdings of bonds in the Bundesbank’s port -
folio decreased by €6.8 billion net, mainly due 
to maturing bonds under the Eurosystem’s pur -
chase programmes. Domestic credit institutions 
scaled back their bond portfolios by €4.9 bil -
lion, primarily by selling foreign securities. Do -
mestic non- banks sold debt securities for €3.6 
billion in net terms. On balance, this solely in -
volved domestic paper.
Equity market
In October, domestic enterprises placed only 
small quantities of new shares in the German 
equity market (€0.6 billion, following €0.7 bil -
lion in the previous month). The volume of for -
eign equities in the German market fell by €0.6 
billion during the same period. Domestic non- 
banks were the sole net buyers of shares (€2.4 
billion). On balance, non- resident investors and 
domestic banks sold shares for €2.4 billion and 
€0.1 billion respectively.
Mutual funds
Domestic mutual funds recorded net outflows 
of €2.4 billion in October (previous month: in -
flows of €2.1 billion). This affected retail funds 
and specialised funds reserved for institutional 
investors in almost equal measure. Among the 
fund providers, the main redeemers of fund 
units were mixed securities funds (-€1.7 billion), 
followed to a lesser extent by equity funds 
(-€0.6 billion) and funds of funds (-€0.5 billion). 
The outstanding volume of foreign mutual 
fund shares distributed in Germany increased 
by €0.7 billion in October. Domestic credit insti -
tutions were virtually the only buyers of mutual 
fund shares on balance (€0.8 billion). Foreign 
investors purchased German mutual fund 
shares worth a net €0.1 billion, while domestic non- banks scaled back their investment in 
funds by €2.6 billion on balance.
German balance of payments 
in October 2023
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €21.4 billion in October 2023, down €6.6 
billion on the previous month’s level. The sur -
plus in the goods account increased slightly, 
but this was significantly outweighed by the 
fact that the balance in invisible current trans -
actions, which comprise services as well as pri -
mary and secondary income, moved into nega -
tive territory.
In October, the surplus in the goods account 
grew by €0.6 billion to €23.1 billion because 
receipts outpaced expenditure.
Invisible current transactions shifted from a sur -
plus of €5.5 billion in September into a deficit 
of €1.7 billion, a contributing factor being the 
expansion of the deficit in the services account 
by €3.0 billion to €9.2 billion. This was mainly 
due to a rise in spending, primarily owing to 
higher expenditure on travel as well as on 
charges for the use of intellectual property. In 
addition, the declines recorded in several items 
dominated the revenue side overall. Moreover, 
the deficit in the secondary income account ex -
panded by €2.2 billion to €6.3 billion. Receipts 
fell, with declining government revenue from 
current taxes on income and wealth making a 
contribution. In addition, expenditure grew, 
with higher general government expenditure 
on current transfers relating to international 
cooperation playing a prominent role. Further -
more, net receipts in primary income con -
tracted by €2.0 billion to €13.8 billion. This fig -
ure was likewise dampened by lower revenues, 
mainly as a result of residents’ reduced receipts 
from direct investment, and higher expend -
iture, primarily owing to higher payments of 
other investment income to non- residents.Purchases of

In October, international financial markets were 
influenced by the conflict in the Middle East; 
on balance, however, differences in the eco -
nomic outlook in the United States and Europe 
had the largest impact on German capital 
flows. Germany’s cross- border portfolio invest -
ment recorded net capital exports of €7.9 bil -
lion, after net capital imports of €23.0 billion in 
September. The crucial factor here was that 
foreign investors reduced their holdings of Ger -
man securities more sharply than German in -
vestors scaled back their holdings of foreign 
paper. Foreign investors sold German instru -
ments to the tune of €10.9 billion net. In par -
ticular, they reduced their holdings of German 
money market paper (€17.3 billion), but added 
bonds to their portfolios (€9.0 billion). They 
also parted with shares issued in Germany 
(€2.7 billion), but left their holdings of mutual 
fund shares virtually unchanged on balance 
(+€0.1 billion). Domestic investors offloaded 
foreign securities in the amount of €3.0 billion 
in October. In particular, they reduced the vol -
ume of foreign bonds in their portfolios (€3.3 
billion), but barely adjusted their holdings of 
money market paper overall (+€0.1 billion). Do -
mestic investors also sold foreign shares (€0.6 
billion), but acquired additional mutual fund 
shares (€0.7 billion).
In October, transactions in financial derivatives 
resulted in net outflows of €11.7 billion (follow -
ing outflows of €1.5 billion in September).
Direct investment generated net capital exports 
of €2.7 billion in October (following net capital 
exports of €19.3 billion in September). Enter -
prises domiciled in Germany invested €12.0 bil -
lion abroad in October. They provided affiliated 
enterprises abroad with €7.9 billion via intra-  
group credit transactions, mainly in the form of 
trade credits. They boosted their equity capital 
by €4.1 billion. Conversely, foreign enterprises 
invested €9.3 billion in their affiliates in Ger -
many, providing funds primarily through intra-  
group lending (€7.1 billion). They stepped up 
their equity capital in enterprises in Germany by 
€2.1 billion.Portfolio invest -

Falling inflation, but not yet time to sound 
the all- clear – outlook for the German 
economy up to 2026
The German economy will recover in the coming years, albeit with a time lag. At present, the 
main factors still slowing growth are weak foreign demand in industry, hesitant private consump -
tion, and higher financing costs for investment brought about by monetary policy tightening. As 
from the beginning of 2024, though, the German economy is likely to return to an expansion path 
and gradually pick up speed. Exports will increase on the back of expanding foreign sales mar -
kets, and households will increase their consumption expenditure as their real incomes rise signifi -
cantly thanks to a stable labour market, strong wage growth and falling inflation. On the other 
hand, private investment will initially continue to decline, not providing moderate stimulus again 
until 2026.
The current projection assumes that calendar- adjusted real gross domestic product (GDP) will 
increase by 0.4% in 2024 following a slight contraction of 0.1% this year. In 2025 and 2026, the 
economy will grow by 1.2% and 1.3%, respectively. Compared with the June projection, the GDP 
rate has been lowered significantly for 2024 and slightly for 2025. Key factors are weaker foreign 
demand, slower growth in consumption and tighter financing conditions.
Inflation in Germany is on the decline, but it is still too early to sound the general all- clear. As 
measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), inflation is likely to come down to 
an annual average of 6.1% this year before dropping to 2.7%, less than one- half of the current 
figure, in 2024. Energy price inflation will decline sharply and food price inflation will also go 
down considerably. It is only this year that core inflation (excluding energy and food) will peak at 
5.1%. It, too, will fall significantly to 3.0% next year. Supply bottlenecks will then no longer be 
such a major problem and profit margins will normalise. Monetary policy tightening is increas -
ingly taking effect. From 2025 onwards, the strong wage growth will decline more markedly, 
although it will remain high. This will see the core rate gradually continue to fall to 2.3% in 2026. 
The headline rate will diminish to 2.2%, which is nonetheless still high. Compared with the June 
projection, the inflation rate was revised downwards noticeably for 2024 and slightly for 2025.
Public finances will benefit from temporary support measures gradually expiring. This will have a 
greater impact than rising expenditure in areas such as defence and pensions. The deficit ratio 
will therefore fall to 2% in 2023 and 1.3% in 2024. It will remain unchanged in the subsequent 
years. The debt ratio will decline, approaching 60% again in 2026. Following the Federal Consti -
tutional Court’s ruling on the debt brake, the fiscal policy stance and its impact on the economy 
are still uncertain, especially from 2025 onwards.
Beyond this, there are other risks owing, in particular, to geopolitical conflicts. Tighter monetary 
policy has reduced, but not yet eliminated, the risk of a more persistent inflation process. Overall, 
risks to economic growth currently remain tilted to the downside, and those to inflation to the 
upside.Deutsche Bundesbank

Economic outlook1
After rising slightly in the second quarter, sea -
sonally adjusted real GDP fell again by the same 
amount in the third quarter.2 The German 
economy thus merely stagnated in the 2023 
summer half- year. By contrast, the June projec -
tion had anticipated a continuous expansion 
that would gradually intensify.3 One reason 
why the recovery initially failed to materialise 
was the unexpectedly weak foreign demand in 
industry, which dampened production and ex -
ports. Moreover, households were more hesi -
tant than expected when it came to discretion -
ary spending. Although their real disposable income actually rose somewhat more strongly 
in the summer half- year than assumed in June, 
they merely kept their consumption stable. This 
increased their saving ratio. Enterprises, mean -
while, expanded their investment moderately 
in line with the June projection. Housing invest -
ment declined, albeit less sharply than pre -
dicted. The construction sector performed sur -
prisingly well overall. Order books were still 
fairly well filled; this probably bolstered produc -
tion more strongly than expected.
Economic output is likely to fall again slightly in 
the current quarter, as suggested by the de -
pressed survey indicators. According to the ifo 
Institute, enterprises’ assessment of their busi -
ness situation was somewhat more negative 
averaged over October and November than in 
the third quarter. The S&P Global Purchasing 
Managers’ Index was in contractionary terri -
tory. The industrial sector, in particular, will 
probably scale back its production further. It 
continues to suffer from subdued demand and 
high energy costs. Both these factors are also a 
drag on exports. Furthermore, weak industrial 
activity is clouding the outlook for business in -
vestment, which is additionally being damp -
ened by higher financing costs and possibly 
also by increased uncertainty surrounding gov -
ernment subsidies in the area of transition and 
climate change mitigation measures. Higher 
interest rates are having an even stronger im -
pact on housing construction. The construction 
industry will probably have to continue adjust -
ing its output to the depressed level of new 
orders. At all events, households are benefiting 
from further gains in purchasing power and a 
stable labour market. They will probably step 
up their consumption again slightly.German econ -

At the beginning of 2024, the German econ -
omy is likely to return to an expansion path 
given that there are initial signs of a slight im -
provement. Business expectations as surveyed 
by the ifo Institute brightened somewhat in Oc -
tober and November. Sentiment in trade and 
manufacturing, in particular, was less pessimis -
tic. In the industrial sector, foreign demand 
may have bottomed out. Export expectations 
have risen of late. Moreover, households’ in -
come situation should continue to improve. 
The labour market remains robust, wages are 
rising sharply and inflation is easing slightly. Pri -
vate consumption is therefore likely to pick up 
somewhat more strongly in the first quarter.
The projection sees growth gradually picking 
up over the course of 2024. It will continue at 
a slightly accelerated pace over the following 
two years. The economic recovery is based on 
two key pillars. First, exports are rising on the 
back of burgeoning demand in German export -
ers’ sales markets. Second, households are ex -
panding their consumption expenditure as real 
incomes rise. Moreover, the saving ratio is 
gradually receding, which is providing con -
sumption with an additional boost. By contrast, 
housing and business investment will decline in 
2024 and will not provide any stimulus in 2025, 
either. It is not until 2026 that they will increase 
moderately again.
On the whole, the German economy is there -
fore slowly emerging from the bout of weak -
ness since the outbreak of the Russian war of 
aggression against Ukraine. Calendar- adjusted 
real GDP will increase by 0.4% in 2024 follow -
ing a slight contraction of 0.1% this year. In 
2025 and 2026, German economic output will 
then expand more sharply, at rates of 1.2% and 
1.3%, respectively.4 The recovery will thus take 
place roughly three quarters later than antici -
pated in the June projection. Nevertheless, the 
GDP rate for 2023 will turn out to be slightly 
higher since the results for the fourth quarter 
of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023 have 
been revised upward. This more than compen -
sates for the weaker second half of 2023. However, the delayed recovery has been re -
flected in a significant downward revision of 
the GDP rate for 2024. The rate for 2025 has 
also been lowered slightly. The deterioration in 
the economic outlook compared with the June 
projection is due to weaker external demand, First signs

working days than 2025. At +1.1% and +1.6%, the un -

slower growth in private consumption owing 
to the current consumer restraint, and lower in -
vestment. The latter is affected by the further 
tightening of financing conditions as a result of 
tighter monetary policy. Another factor is that 
government support for private investment in 
the areas of climate change and transformation 
is now expected to be lower.5
The German economy will not come close to 
its potential output again until 2026. Potential 
growth rates are expected to be subdued com -
pared with the pre- pandemic period. After 
+0.6% in 2023, +0.4% in 2024 and +0.5% in 
2025, a potential rate of +0.7% is estimated for 2026.6 These low rates are mainly due to the 
impact of the persistently higher energy costs 
caused by Russia’s attack on Ukraine.7 In add -
ition, demographics are having a dampening 
effect. However, in the current high inflation 
environment, the fact that economic output 
will remain below its potential for such a long 
time is not an indication of a widespread ab -
sence of aggregate demand. Instead, the spate 
of recent supply disruptions has weighed even 
more heavily on economic activity than on po -
tential output for some time now.8
Economic activity in detail
Exports are likely to decline again in the current 
quarter. This is indicated by ifo export expect -
ations, which improved in October and No -
vember but remained predominantly pessimis -
tic. In addition, industrial new orders from 
abroad continued to decline in the third quar -
ter, even though the underlying trend, at least, 
is showing signs of bottoming out.9 Persistently 
weak external demand is weighing on the 
export- driven industrial sector. This sector is 
also having to hold its own in a challenging 
international competitive environment, not 
least because of the considerable rise in energy 
costs in Germany in the wake of the Ukraine 
war. Nonetheless, surveys by the ifo Institute 
suggest that supply bottlenecks have eased sig -
nificantly. From the first quarter of 2024 on -
wards, exports are expected to slowly return to 
a recovery path as the global economic recov -

manent consequences of the supply shocks rather than the 
temporary effects which do, however, dampen GDP itself.

Underlying conditions for macroeconomic projections
The projection is based on assumptions by 
Eurosystem experts about the global econ-
omy, exchange rates, commodity prices and 
interest rates. These assumptions are based 
on information that was available on 
23 November 2023. The projection incorp-
orates fi  scal policy measures as soon as they 
are suffi   ciently specifi  ed and their imple-
mentation is considered likely.
Restrained global economic growth
Global economic activity expanded some-
what more materially in the second and 
third quarters of the current year than ex-
pected in the June projection. This was as-
sociated with, in particular, robust domestic 
activity in the United States. In the fi  nal 
quarter of this year, however, momentum is 
likely to weaken visibly. Global economic 
growth will therefore be slightly lower than 
in the summer half- year.1 The central banks’ 
tighter monetary policy is contributing to 
the declining infl  ation rates in numerous 
countries. At the same time, the higher 
fi  nancing costs are a negative factor for the 
global economy. In contrast, robust labour 
market developments and prospects of fur-
ther real income growth are underpinning 
demand. The consequences of China’s 
structural challenges, such as the problems 
on its property market, are also having a 
ripple effect on the global economy. Over-
all, global economic activity is expected to 
be similarly subdued over the projection 
horizon as in the June projection. Following 
3.3% growth in the current year, the global 
economy excluding the euro area will grow 
at a slightly lower rate of 3.1% in the com-
ing year. Growth rates of 3.2% are ex-
pected for both 2025 and 2026.
Economic development fi  gures in the other 
euro area countries on which the projection is based are derived from the forecasts of 
the national central banks, which were in-
corporated into the projection for the euro 
area published by the ECB on 14 December 
2023.2 Economic growth for the euro area 
excluding Germany is therefore expected to 
be slightly weaker than in the June projec-
tion, with rates of 0.8% in 2023 and 1.0% 
in 2024. Following 1.7% growth in 2025, 
largely in line with the June projection, eco-
nomic activity is expected to rise by 1.6% in 
2026.
As some advanced economies posted 
lower- than- expected imports in the 2023 
summer half- year, the outlook for inter-
national trade is slightly below the June 
projection. Import demand from the emer-
ging economies was also estimated to be 
lower. The average growth rate of 1.1% for 
global trade (excluding the euro area) in the 
current year is also being dampened by the 
decline in the 2022-23 winter half- year. A 
growth rate of 3.0% is estimated for each 
of the years 2024 and 2025. At a rate of 
3.2%, slightly higher momentum is ex-
pected in 2026. The sales markets of Ger-
man exporters are likely to expand even 
more slowly than global trade in the com-
ing year. This is because import growth of 
trading partners within the euro area and 
some other advanced economies, which 
account for a large proportion of German 
export markets, is lagging somewhat be-
hind the momentum of global trade as a 
whole. Somewhat higher export market 
growth is expected in 2025 and 2026, 
which will then turn out to be similar to 
growth of global trade.

Technical assumptions of the projection
Energy commodity prices rose again over 
the summer. Production cuts by Saudi Ara-
bia and Russia, in particular, led to higher 
prices in the crude oil markets. Whereas 
forward quotations suggest that prices will 
fall over the next three years, the crude oil 
price assumptions remain above those of 
the June projection. Thanks to well- fi  lled 
gas storage facilities, the expected rise in 
wholesale gas prices in Europe for the 
colder months of the year has so far been 
slightly lower than estimated in June.3 For-
ward quotations suggest a gradual decline 
in European gas prices after the winter of 
2024-25. Over the next two years, they will 
remain slightly below the trajectory as-
sumed for the June projection. European 
electricity prices, which are closely linked to 
gas prices, also rose far less considerably in 
the second half of this year than expected 
in June and have even declined recently. For the European electricity markets, futures in-
dicate higher prices for the winter months 
up to the end of the projection period, al-
though the increases will be lower than as-
sumed in the June projection.
In view of the weaker economic outlook, 
other commodity prices have fallen more 
sharply in recent months than expected in 
June. It is assumed that prices will rise again 
slightly on average in 2025 and 2026. Agri-
cultural producer prices in the euro area 
have fallen more persistently in recent 
months than estimated in the June projec-
tion. The more stable trend in gas prices, 
which has an impact inter alia on fertiliser 
prices, is also likely to have contributed to 
this development. Forward quotations sug-
gest that producer prices for food will re-
main largely unchanged until 2026.
According to the June projection and the 
ECB’s September projection, infl  ation in the 
euro area will remain too high for too long. 
At each of its monetary policy meetings in 
June, July and September, the ECB Govern-
ing Council therefore decided to raise key 
interest rates by a further 25 basis points in 
order to bring infl  ation back to its medium- 
term target without delay. In addition, prin-
cipal payments from maturing securities 
under the asset purchase programme (APP) 
have no longer been reinvested since July 
2023. In October, the ECB Governing Coun-
cil left its key interest rates unchanged. The 
Governing Council’s decisions on the ap-
propriate level of the key interest rate will 
remain data- driven. Against the backdrop 
of the additional tightening of monetary 
policy, money market rates have continued 
to rise in recent months. For the next two 
years, however, the EURIBOR futures rates 
will be on a downward trend before indi-
cating a largely steady level for 2026. The

EURIBOR will therefore be slightly higher 
next year than assumed in the June projec-
tion and then marginally lower in 2025. 
After the June projection was fi  nalised, 10- 
year German government bond yields also 
initially continued to rise, but then fell again 
in November. Forward quotations indicate a 
largely constant yield for the next two 
years, which will rise again slightly in 2026. 
The yield level will therefore be above the 
June projection in the next two years. Finan-
cing costs for bank loans are also expected 
to be higher than in the June projection.
Changing expectations among market par-
ticipants regarding the US Federal Reserve’s 
monetary policy stance as well as incoming 
US and euro area economic data caused 
the external value of the euro to rise initially 
in the summer and then fall again. In the 
period relevant for deriving exchange rate 
assumptions, the euro was trading at 
US$1.08, largely unchanged from the June 
assumption. However, gains by the euro 
against some central European currencies, 
the yen and the renminbi contributed to a 
1.6% appreciation of the euro against 41 
currencies of importance to German foreign 
trade.
Fiscal projection for Germany: 
schematic  adjustment to the ruling 
on the debt brake
The Federal Government and some Federal 
states are currently revising their fi  nancial 
plans in order to align them with the ruling 
handed down by the Federal Constitutional 
Court on the debt brake.4 Consultations in 
this context were still under way when the 
projection was fi  nalised (see p. 20 on the 
latest agreements concerning central gov-
ernment fi  nances for 2024). For 2023, the 
projection takes into account the informa-
tion in the draft supplementary budget for 
2023. For 2024, it no longer contains any 
measures that the Economic Stabilisation Fund for Energy Assistance (ESF- E) should 
fi  nance. In particular, the energy price 
brakes will expire at the end of 2023 and 
central government will no longer stabilise 
the grid fees in 2024. In addition, €60 bil-
lion of the reserve for the Climate and 
Transformation Fund (Climate Fund) will be 
immediately cancelled as a result of the rul-
ing. This will be taken into account by sche-
matically lowering the projected expenses 
prior to the ruling. Only those grants with 
which the Federal  Government offsets the 
renewable energy levy on the electricity 
price are not affected . This is because a le-
gislative amendment would be necessary to 
implement a reduction. As a result, the Cli-
mate Fund will only run annual defi  cits of 
less than €10 billion in the projection from 
2024 to 2026.

Lapsing of crisis measures easing pres-
sure on the general government budget
Temporary crisis- related measures will 
weigh heavily on public fi  nances for the last 
time in 2023, with the share of these meas-
ures in gross domestic product falling from 
1¾% in the current year to ½% in the com-
ing year. By 2025, these burdens will have 
lapsed altogether (see chart above). Among 
the energy price support measures, the 
transfers in the course of the electricity and 
gas price brakes are particularly signifi  cant. 
Moreover, the ESF- E pays supplementary 
aid to hospitals and care facilities in particu-
lar. Substantial government revenue short-
falls will result from the fact that remuner-
ation components will be exempt from tax 
as infl  ation compensation premiums up to 
and including 2024. In addition, VAT on 
natural gas and district heating will remain 
reduced until the end of February 2024. In 
2024, the crisis measures will mainly affect the promotion of infl  ation compensation 
premiums.
Other measures will have a net negative 
impact on the general government 
budget
In addition to short- term crisis support, the 
projection includes a number of other fi  scal 
policy measures. In terms of revenue, the 
income tax rate in particular will shift in 
2023 and 2024 to compensate for the pre-
vious year’s bracket creep.5 It is assumed 
that legislators will continue this practice. 
The Growth Opportunities Act (Wachstums-
chancengesetz) and a lower electricity tax 
for companies in the manufacturing sector 
in 2024 and 2025 are also included – both 
are planned but have not yet been adopted. 
Social security contribution rates will in-
crease signifi  cantly up until 2026. Above all, 
health insurance institutions are raising their 
supplementary contribution rates in order 
to close funding gaps. The truck toll will 
also generate signifi  cant additional revenue 
as of 2024 due to higher toll rates and an 
expanded toll obligation.
5 Various measures are also taken into account regard-
ing expenditure. However, the projected expenditure 
by central, regional and local authorities as well as so-
cial security organisations generally cannot be allo-
cated to individual measures. They are addressed in 
the description of the projection where they are rele-
vant for the respective development.Temporary fiscal measures affecting

ery causes sales markets to grow.10 Over the 
course of next year, exports will then pick up 
momentum, keeping a roughly constant pace 
over the remainder of the projection horizon. 
They will grow more slowly overall than the 
sales markets, since the comparatively sharp 
rise in labour costs in Germany is eroding the 
price competitiveness of German exporters. 
They will therefore be forced to sustain losses 
in market share, especially in trade with euro 
area partner countries.
Despite adverse underlying conditions, business 
investment has so far been robust.11 However, 
enterprises’ spending on capital goods will 
probably already begin to fall during the current 
quarter. As a result of monetary policy tighten -
ing and the slowdown in economic activity, 
interest rates on loans to enterprises rose sig -
nificantly, and commercial banks tightened their 
lending policies appreciably. In this setting, 
banks’ net lending to enterprises fell into nega -
tive territory, meaning that the annual growth 
rate in October of this year was negative for the 
first time in more than eight years. This was also 
reflected in domestic demand for capital goods, 
which plummeted in the third quarter. Accord -
ing to the ifo Institute, sentiment among capital 
goods producers also deteriorated significantly. 
Heightened uncertainty surrounding future 
government support for investment in the areas 
of climate change mitigation and the transition 
to a low- carbon economy is likely to further 
dampen propensity to invest. A stronger slump 
is being prevented by what is still a considerable 
order backlog. The tightening of monetary pol -
icy, in particular, will probably curb investment 
activity for some time to come. Moreover, weak 
export dynamics are providing only a small 
boost to investment. All in all, the projection ex -
pects business investment to decline next year. 
Over the remainder of the projection horizon, 
however, the continuous improvement in for -
eign demand, in particular, will increasingly pro -
vide momentum. On an annual average, busi -
ness investment will grow only marginally in 
2025, but will then expand more significantly 
again in 2026.The underlying conditions for private consump -
tion will improve markedly over the projection 
horizon. This is because households’ real dis -
posable income is rising significantly thanks to 
a stable labour market, steep wage increases 
and subsiding inflation. The greatest improve -
ment is expected to take place in 2024. After Weak industrial

11 In 2023 so far, spending on machinery and equipment, 
commercial buildings and other investment, which mainly 
includes expenditure on research and development, has

been the potential for catching up after the slump during 
the COVID-  19 crisis as well as the significant improvement 
in the availability of some capital goods.Deutsche Bundesbank

this, income growth will tail off slightly. Private 
consumption will probably already edge up 
again in the current quarter, as indicated by 
new private car registrations according to data 
from the German Association of the Automo -
tive Industry (VDA) and real retail sales, which 
exceeded the previous quarter’s level in Octo -
ber. However, according to the GfK survey, 
consumer sentiment remained weak of late, al -
though it had at least stabilised. According to 
GfK, precautionary motives are playing a major 
role in the subdued propensity to consume.12 
Besides this, the latest increase in the saving 
ratio is also likely to have been driven by back- 
payments for electricity and heating for 2022.13 
Higher interest rates on savings deposits could 
also play a part. Against this backdrop, house -
holds are unlikely to fully channel the increase 
in their real income into higher consumer 
spending at first. The saving ratio will rise a 
 little further until the first quarter of 2024. 
However, it will then gradually recede over the 
remainder of the projection horizon. This is  because the special factors associated with 
 energy back- payments will expire, and precau -
tionary motives will subside. From the middle 
of next year, private consumption will therefore 
increase slightly more strongly than real dispos -
able income for some time. Towards the end of 
the projection horizon, both metrics will grow 
at a similar rate, with the saving ratio reaching 
more or less its long- term average.
Real income losses for households, soaring 
construction costs, higher financing costs and 
more restrictive lending policies have now 
pushed down demand for housing sharply. Net 
lending for housing practically came to a stand -
still. In the third quarter, both building permits 
and new orders for housing construction were 
significantly lower than their levels at the be -
ginning of 2022. Large order backlogs in the 
construction sector have so far cushioned the 
drop in demand somewhat. According to sur -
veys by the ifo Institute, the range of orders in 
housing construction was still above the long- 
term average in November. However, it has de -
clined significantly compared to its peak. The 
share of firms with a shortage of orders actu -
ally rose to almost 50%. It should therefore be 
assumed that weaker demand will increasingly 
affect construction activity. Housing investment 
is already likely to fall significantly in the current 
quarter. According to the projection, it will 
continue to decline in the course of 2024, al -
beit at lower rates. It will not bottom out until 
the beginning of 2025. After this, a moderate 
recovery will set in. This is due to several fac -
tors. For example, the fundamental demand for 
housing remains intact and is being amplified 
by the high level of immigration. Furthermore, 
it is assumed that financing costs will not con -
tinue to rise, and real household income will 
recover significantly. Renovations to increase

stock will probably provide support over the 
entire projection horizon. These will become 
more important in the light of higher heating 
costs and the heating transition as part of cli -
mate policy.
Real government consumption will fall signifi -
cantly this year, owing to the fact that 
pandemic- related health spending has ex -
pired.14 Higher spending on asylum seekers and 
the military, for example, will dampen the de -
cline somewhat. From 2024 onwards, real gov -
ernment consumption will go back up steeply. 
This is mainly due to a significant increase in 
intermediate consumption and social transfers 
in kind. Real government investment will grow 
sharply over the entire projection horizon, with 
a particularly steep rise in investment in military 
machinery and equipment. By contrast, it is as -
sumed that government investment in con -
struction will edge up more slowly in the com -
ing years than in the current year. This is be -
cause local government finances are coming 
under increasing strain.
As domestic demand recovers, imports will 
grow more strongly than exports, which are 
being held back by diminishing competitive -
ness. This will put downward pressure on the 
trade surplus and the current account surplus 
over the entire projection horizon. Neverthe -
less, these surpluses will initially rise sharply this 
year – probably to 6.7% of GDP in the current 
account. In the previous year, the current ac -
count balance totalled only 4.4% owing to the 
deterioration in the terms of trade on the back 
of a sharp rise in energy prices. The rebound 
this year is mainly due to the improved terms of 
trade as a result of lower prices for imported 
commodities (especially natural gas and other 
energy imports). This is likely to continue over 
the remainder of the projection horizon, albeit 
to a noticeably lesser degree. Although some 
commodity prices will presumably actually go 
back up, a gradual decline is likely, in particular 
for crude oil prices. Overall, import prices will 
therefore increase at only a comparatively 
moderate pace. By contrast, export prices will rise quite steeply in the coming years, mainly as 
a result of strong domestic wage pressures. All 
in all, the trade balance will decline slightly be -

Labour market
Despite the economy being mired in a down -
turn for over one and a half years now, the la -
bour market has remained remarkably stable. 
Only in the third quarter of 2023 did the previ -
ously significant increase in employment come 
to a virtual halt. There is still a pronounced 
shortage of skilled workers in large parts of the 
economy. Although the number of job vacan -
cies declined somewhat, it continues to be very 
high, with the time taken to fill vacancies still 
lengthy. Hours worked per worker recovered 
only slowly from the depressed levels of 2022.

somewhat, the economic slowdown was re -Government

14 As of the second quarter of 2023, the national accounts 
no longer record local public transport in the corporate 
sector but in the government sector. However, this statis -
tical reclassification does not play a role in the real path of 
government consumption described here. It only affects 
the deflator of government consumption. (Real) transport 
services remain part of private consumption. The deflator 
of government consumption will therefore show excep -
tionally strong growth this year, but this also reflects wage 
increases and the general upward pressure on prices.Deutsche Bundesbank

flected in relatively low overtime worked and 
the reduction of balances on working time ac -
counts. Short- time work continues to be less 
relevant at the current time. By contrast, the 
weak economy left more significant but still 
limited traces in the form of a gradual rise in 
registered unemployment, but this is only partly 
related to cyclical weakness. A somewhat 
greater part of the increase since June 2022 is 
due to the gradual inclusion of immigrants, 
with the proportion of refugees being high.
Given the only lagged and slow economic re -
covery, no increase in total employment is to 
be expected in the current quarter or the first 
quarter of 2024. However, all leading indicators 
are suggesting that the high level of employ -
ment achieved can be maintained. According 
to the ifo Institute, recruitment plans of trade 
and industry, a sector that is particularly ex -
posed to economic stress at present, tend to 
be in negative territory. However, extrapolated 
to the aggregate economy, the outlook is neu -
tral. The risk of dismissal is very low by histor -
ical standards. The number of newly registered 
job seekers at the Federal Employment Agency 
(BA) soon to lose their jobs is still high at 
present. However, the probability of hiring un -
employed persons is likewise relatively low at 
the current time. Unemployment is therefore 
likely to rise somewhat in the coming months, 
especially among job seekers who have com -
pleted language and integration courses.15
In the course of 2024, hours worked per 
worker will rise initially as the economic recov -
ery takes hold. Employment will also shift back 
onto an upward path, with a slight time lag, 
but will grow only to a relatively small degree. 
Employment is already at a very high level and 
the shortage of skilled workers will increase 
again as soon as there is a significant rise in de -
mand for labour. Despite the negative demo -

again markedly in 2024. The process of inte -
grating the many immigrants who came in 
2022 and 2023 is making itself felt here. How -
ever, integration into employment is particu -
larly challenging for refugees, as they did not 
migrate for the purpose of work and the skills 
they bring with them often do not match la -
bour demand, for example. This is another rea -
son why registered unemployment is still ex -
pected to be slightly higher on average in 2024 
than in the current year. On the other hand, 
unemployment will start to decline again in the 
second half of 2024 as the economic recovery 
accelerates.
Owing to demographic developments, labour 
supply will increasingly be the constraining fac -
tor for the labour market in the coming years. 
The rising labour force participation rate of the 
population and the high level of immigration in 
recent years have so far more than made up for 
the dampening impact of demographics. How -
ever, the labour force participation rate will 
stop rising in the medium term owing to the 
unfavourable age structure in Germany, al -
though the individual propensity to work is 
likely to continue to increase. This is mainly due 
to the fact that “baby boomers” are leaving the 
prime- age bracket, where participation rates 
are highest. With regard to immigration, this 
projection assumes a balance of 300,000 per -
sons per year in the medium term.16 The mas -
sive influx of immigrants over the past 12 years 
has improved the demographic structure of the 
population, as it was mainly young people, in -
cluding many children, who came to Germany. 
This development will also dampen the bur -
dens of demographic change in Germany in 
the future. The majority of these people need 
to be successfully integrated into the labour 
market, however. Given the assumptions made 
here, the labour supply will not increase signifi -
cantly overall in 2025 and will decline slightly in 
2026.
In 2025, employment will continue to grow 
somewhat while the economy continues to re -
cover, with unemployment declining at the same time. Furthermore, hours worked per 
worker will also go up slightly via an increase in 
the number of overtime hours. However, there 
is not much upward headroom here either as, 
taking a longer- term perspective, hours worked 
will tend to decline due to the rise in the share 
of women and older persons, who are more 
often in part- time employment. The labour 
market will continue to become tighter overall. 
In 2026, both the increase in employment and 
the number of hours worked will largely come 
to a halt as a result of the shortage of labour 
supply. At the same time, unemployment will 
fall again slightly. As immigrants gain more 
work experience and enterprises boost their 
capacity utilisation, the economic recovery to -

ously subdued labour productivity.
Labour costs and prices
The wage agreements concluded so far this 
year were once again higher than the already 
strong results for 2022. The compensation of 
previous real wage losses continued to play a 
key role, a widespread combination being sig -
nificant tax- free and social contribution- exempt 
inflation compensation bonuses and high per -
manent wage increases. The wage increases 
agreed after the June projection were well above expectations, in particular in the smaller 
sectors. At the same time, negotiations in some 
major sectors proved to be very heavy going. 
As a case in point, negotiations in the retail 
sector as well as in wholesale and foreign trade 
that have been ongoing since April have still 
not been concluded. The expected pay rises in 
the retail sector will thus be shifted into 2024, 
as compared with the assumptions of the June 
projection. It was no longer possible to include 
the pay settlement in the public sector of the 
Federal states reached on 8 December 2023.17 
It is assumed that higher negotiated wages for 
the retail sector and public sector of the Federal 
states will no longer be disbursed this year. 
These postponements will affect around six 
million employees and lead to a somewhat 
smaller increase in overall negotiated rates of 
pay (4.0%) in 2023 than anticipated in the June 
projection.18
At the same time, the projection for 2024 was 
revised upwards substantially to 5.0%. The 
stronger than expected and, in some cases, 
delayed rise in wages in this year’s pay round 
will outweigh the significantly lower assump -
tions for wage settlements in 2024 in view of 
the weaker economic outlook compared to the 
June projection. These will be considerably 
lower than in previous years but remain com -
paratively high. This is due to the fact that 
losses in purchasing power suffered in previous 
years have not yet been fully compensated for, 
while inflation is falling but still above- average 
and the labour market is robust overall. How -
ever, the decelerating wage growth will not be 
clearly visible in the projection of negotiated 
wages until 2025. In addition, no more infla -
tion compensation bonuses will be awarded 
from that time. Overall, growth in negotiated Substantial

wages will fall to rates of around 3% for both 
2025 and 2026, which still roughly corresponds 
to the level of 2018 and 2019, years character -
ised by a strong economy.
Growth of actual earnings will consistently out -
pace that of negotiated wages over the projec -
tion horizon. Compensation for high inflation, 
staff shortages, longer working hours, higher 
performance bonuses and the strong wage in -
creases among low earners triggered by the 
rise in the minimum wage in October 2022 are 
contributing factors this year.19 At just under 
6% in 2023, actual earnings will rise at their 
fastest rate in more than 30 years. In contrast 
to negotiated wages, their growth will already 
tail off somewhat in the coming year. The min -
imum wage increase from January 2024 will 
provide little stimulus. More importantly, there 
are the effects of the still subdued economic 
activity and the associated lower performance 
bonuses. Wage growth will then decline more 
significantly in 2025 and 2026. However, at 
rates of around 3½%, it will remain higher than 
the historical average since reunification. This is 
due to a combination of a high level of labour 
market tightness and pent- up demand from 
the period of high inflation. Compensation per 
employee will increase at a similar pace to ac -
tual earnings, possibly even somewhat more 
strongly in 2025 and 2026 when employers’ 
social contributions rise.
Combined with declining economic activity and 
a stable labour market, unit labour costs will 
rise extremely sharply this year, with their 
growth a major factor in the high level of do -
mestic inflation. In addition, enterprises will be 
able to expand their profit margins slightly on 
average this year. In previous years, margins 
had already risen steeply in an environment of 
strong and, in some cases, pent- up demand (in 
the form of higher order backlogs, for ex -
ample), supply- side bottlenecks and high infla -
tion rates. Recently, however, they have already 
eased off to a point. Unit labour costs will con -
tinue to exert very significant pressure next 
year, as the economy is set to recover only gradually, with robust employment but very 
high wage growth. Enterprises are likely to ab -
sorb this development through their profits, 
however. This is due to the fact that they enjoy 
a very satisfactory earnings situation, the sup -
ply bottlenecks will have largely dissipated in 
2024 and pent- up demand is receding – also as 
a result of the tightening of monetary policy. 
Aggregate profit margins will therefore fall 
steeply in 2024 and return roughly to pre-  Growth of

pandemic levels in 2025. From 2025 onwards, 
in addition to weaker wage growth, the recov -
ery in labour productivity will contribute to unit 
labour costs rising at a markedly slower pace. 
Against this backdrop, domestic inflation as 
measured by the GDP deflator will fall markedly 
in 2024, from 6.2% this year to 2.9%, and over 
the remainder of the projection horizon will 
gradually decline to 2.1% in 2026.
After reaching an all- time high of 8.7% (as 
measured by the HICP) last year, inflation de -
clined markedly during the course of this year. 
It is expected to reach 6.1% on average in 
2023. The main reason for the easing of price 
pressures is the deceleration in energy price in -
creases – which were initially dampened by 
government relief measures and lastly by lower 
fuel prices. By contrast, food inflation is likely to 
remain in double digits overall on average for 
2023, even though it has already fallen steeply 
over the course of the year and some products 
have even seen prices slashed significantly. Only this year will core inflation (excluding en -
ergy and food) reach its peak at 5.1%. It is par -
ticularly in services where it is up once again 
from the previous year. Continued pent- up de -
mand for services that were not available dur -
ing the pandemic has initially been a factor, 
allowing an increase in profit margins in some 
sectors. This is compounded by the steep hike 
in wages, lagged adjustments to the sharp in -
crease in the general statutory minimum wage 
in October 2022 and repercussions following 
the considerable rise in energy prices last year. 
In the case of non- energy industrial goods, 
price inflation is again well above average for 
2023. Supply chain disruptions initially still had 
an impact here, although they eased over the 
course of the year, causing consumer price in -
flation to drop in the second half of the year.
The June projection had assumed a steep de -
cline in the inflation rate for the second half of 
2023, partly because the sharp price rises in the

from the calculation. Actual developments 
were even slightly more pronounced. At 2.3%, 
headline HICP inflation was 0.4  percentage 
point lower than expected in November and 
the core rate was even down by 0.5 percent -
age point. The fact that non- energy industrial 
goods price inflation weakened more rapidly 
than assumed in the wake of price develop -
ments at the upstream stages also played a 
role. However, this also largely reflected unex -
pectedly sharp price slumps for some services 
with fluctuating price patterns, such as air 
travel, which are unlikely to be permanent. The 
comparatively low rates should therefore not 
detract from the fact that underlying price 
pressures are still strong. The core rate was still 
3.5% in November. Moreover, the headline 
rate will be significantly higher again in the 
coming months. A considerable surge is to be 
expected in December, in particular, as the gov -
ernment covering advance payments for gas 
and district heating bills a year ago had tem -
porarily depressed price levels significantly.
Next year, narrowing profit margins are likely to 
take the pressure out of core inflation. Particu -
larly in the case of non- energy industrial goods, 
inflation will then fall to a sizeable extent. It will 
remain above average, however, as price pres -
sures caused by rising labour costs will still be 
very high. As wages have a greater impact on 
services prices than on other price compon -
ents, services price inflation will decline less sig -
nificantly. For food prices, by contrast, the infla -
tion rate will drop considerably despite the rise 
in wages, as agricultural producer prices in the 
euro area are assumed to be lower. Falling 
prices are also expected for energy commod -
ities. However, the impact on energy price in -
flation will be softened somewhat by the expiry 
of government measures to dampen the rise in 
energy prices. This concerns, for example, the 
temporary cut in the VAT rate on gas and dis -
trict heating and the price brakes on electricity 
and gas tariffs.20 Second, the annual increase in 
the CO₂ price on fossil fuels, which was sus -
pended in 2023, will be resumed. This will 
make a marked contribution to energy price in -flation over the next three years.21 Overall, the 
inflation rate in 2024 is likely to decline by more 
than one- half to 2.7%. Core inflation is ex -
pected to fall to 3.0%.
According to the projection, energy prices will 
remain fairly stable in 2025 and 2026 and will 
thus hardly contribute to headline inflation any 
more.22 This is in contrast to food prices, which 
will continue to rise sharply owing to persistent 
wage pressures, as agricultural producer prices 
will no longer offer relief. Although monetary 
policy tightening will continue to yield results, 
core inflation will fall only slowly, as it, too, will

20 The projection assumes that the price brakes will expire 
at the end of this year. While the average retail tariffs for 
electricity may then have already fallen below the brake 
value, the retail tariffs for gas may still be somewhat above 
the brake value when the brake expires.

price on inflation, see p. 20.

strong wage dynamics. For a while, the sharp 
rise in unit labour costs in 2023 and 2024 will 
continue to have an impact. And further wage 
growth will remain above average, though it 
will no longer be as strong as in previous years. 
All in all, by 2026, headline inflation will be 
down to 2.2% and core inflation down to 
2.3%. Both rates will thus remain above aver -
age over the longer term.
Public finances
According to this projection, the general gov -
ernment deficit ratio will fall from 2.5% in 2022 
to 2.0% this year. Temporary crisis measures 
have been much less substantial in 2023, thus 
reducing the burden on budgets compared 
with the previous year (see p. 22). Other devel -
opments are weighing on public finances. Infla -
tion, for example, is pushing up expenditure 
considerably. In particular, intermediate con -
sumption and interest expenditure on inflation- 
indexed securities are significantly higher. Aside 
from this, expenditure on defence and climate 
action is increasing. Economic activity is also 
weighing on the budget somewhat. In add -
ition, developments in profit- related taxes are 
significantly weaker than would be expected 
on the basis of the macroeconomic reference 
variables – unlike in 2022, when they saw a 
significantly stronger rise than the reference 
variables would have suggested.
According to the projection, the deficit ratio 
will fall significantly to 1.3% in 2024 and re -
main virtually unchanged in the years that fol -
low (for information on how the Federal Con -
stitutional Court’s ruling on the debt brake will 
be taken into account, see pp. 21f.). The tem -
porary crisis assistance will have been phased 
out largely in 2024, and entirely in 2025. Taken 
in isolation, the deficit will fall sharply, above all 
next year. The weak economy will still have an 
impact at first. It is not until 2026 that its damp -
ening effect will recede and then become 
deficit- neutral.Without the temporary effects of the crisis 
measures and economic activity, i.e. in struc -
tural terms, the balance will gradually deterior -
ate. Expenditure on the military, in particular, 
will increase significantly from 2024 onwards. 
In addition, grants to finance the renewable 
energy (EEG) levy will rise sharply in 2024. This 
is because the sale of electricity from renew -
able energy plants will not cover the promised 
proceeds, and the reserves from the EEG levy 
will then be used up. Wage growth in the pub -
lic sector will be strong, mainly as a result of 
high wage adjustments.23 Moreover, pension 
expenditure will rise dynamically. This is mainly 
a lagged reflection of the high wage increases 
at the macroeconomic level. Demographic de -
velopments will also play a role, however: more 
and more people will be reaching retirement 
age. Growth in expenditure on health and 
long- term care will also outpace that of the ref -
erence variables for social security contribu -
tions. Nonetheless, this gap will largely be off -
set by the assumption of higher contribution 
rates. For interest expenditure, the burdens as -
sociated with inflation- indexed debt instru -
ments will decrease from 2024 onwards but 
this will be outweighed by rising refinancing 
costs.
The debt ratio is still trending downwards and, 
according to this projection, will stand at 
60.7% at the end of 2026 (2022: 66.1%). This 
decline is mainly due to the strong growth in 
nominal GDP (denominator effect). Moreover, 
the Federal Government is paring back debt re -
lated to coronavirus assistance loans and to 
bad bank portfolios stemming from the finan -
cial crisis. If the generational capital fund an -
nounced by the Federal Government were to 
be implemented, this in itself would increase 
the debt ratio, as the required capital is to be 
funded primarily from loans.24 The repayments Lower deficit

here. These are expected to rise to 2.3% of 
GDP by 2026. In economic analyses, they 
should be counted towards the German debt 
ratio.25
Risk assessment
The macroeconomic projections presented 
here are subject to several uncertainties. All in 
all, risks to economic growth are tilted to the 
downside, and risks to inflation to the upside, 
at present.
The fiscal policy stance and its impact on the 
economy are still not completely certain follow -
ing the Federal Constitutional Court’s ruling on 
the debt brake. After this projection was final -
ised, German fiscal policymakers responded to 
the ruling, particularly with regard to central 
government finances in 2024. This means that 
there is no need for significant revisions to the 
projection (see the box on p. 34). However, the 
details of some parts of the agreements still 
need to be fleshed out, and responses by the 
state governments are also still pending in 
some cases. Furthermore, it remains uncertain 
how the future climate and transformation pol -
icy stance from 2025 onwards is to be struc -
tured and financed in concrete terms. This goes 
hand in hand with uncertainty about important 
underlying conditions for the German econ -
omy.
In addition, there are geopolitical risks, espe -
cially with regard to the wars in Ukraine and 
the Middle East. An intensification of geopolit -
ical conflicts would probably lead to tensions 
on the international energy and commodity 
markets and could trigger renewed supply 
chain disruptions. If the war in the Middle East 
were to escalate and spread to (crude oil-  
exporting) neighbouring countries, the price of 
crude oil could rise rather than fall as projected. 
This would weigh on the German economy and, at the same time, fuel inflation. There 
could be similar consequences if the supply 
situation for natural gas in Germany were to 
worsen again. The gas storage facilities are cur -
rently much better filled than is usual for this 
time of year. The Federal Network Agency 
therefore considers the risk of a gas shortage 
to be low at present.26 However, residual risks 
persist. They are associated, for example, with 
a colder- than- average winter or a halt in Rus -
sian gas supplies to southern Europe. In the 
former case, the demand for gas in Germany 
would be higher. In the latter, less gas would 
be available because Germany would export 
more to southern Europe.27
The risk that the inflation process will prove 
more stubborn than assumed in the projection 
has been reduced, but not yet eliminated, by 
the tighter monetary policy stance. For ex -
ample, the combination of prior real wage 
losses and a tightening labour market could 
lead to even stronger wage growth. This would 
probably result in correspondingly higher 
second- round effects on consumer prices. In -
flation could also remain elevated for longer if 
firms absorb the pressure from unit labour 
costs via reduced profit margins to a lesser ex -
tent than assumed in the projection. This could 
occur, say, given less intense competition or a 
more favourable demand situation. In an even 
longer- lasting high- inflation environment, the 
risk of economic agents adapting to elevated 
inflation and adjusting their long- term inflation 
expectations upwards would ultimately in -
crease. Inflation could then become further en -
trenched.Downside risks

27 Since the projection was finalised, futures prices for en -
ergy commodities have decreased, especially for the short 
term. Further technical assumptions underlying the projec -
tion have also changed since then. For example, market 
expectations for the Euribor and the yield on long- term 
government bonds in the euro area have declined. In add -
ition, the euro has depreciated. Viewed in isolation, these 
changes in the underlying conditions would have a slight 
positive impact on GDP growth over the projection hori -
zon. They would dampen inflation somewhat next year, 
but increase it slightly in 2025 and 2026.Deutsche Bundesbank

What do the latest announcements on central government 
ﬁ  nances for 2024 mean for the projection?
The projection is based on assumptions as 
to how ﬁ  scal policy will react to the ruling 
by the Federal Constitutional Court (see 
pp. 21f.). After the projection was ﬁ  nalised, 
leading Federal Government policymakers 
adopted new resolutions on central govern-
ment ﬁ  nances for 2024. Only a few details 
were known as this report went to press. 
Overall, however, there is no signiﬁ  cant 
need to revise the projection at present – 
with neither the ﬁ  scal nor the macroeco-
nomic outlook requiring any revision as 
things currently stand.
The announcements indicate that indirect 
levies are likely to increase slightly more 
sharply than projected. This applies to the 
price of national CO₂ certiﬁ  cates in 2024 
and 2025 and other indirect levies (in par-
ticular, a new levy on plastic products). 
Planned expenditure is apparently also 
somewhat higher than assumed in our pro-
jection. The information available on this is 
patchier, however. Overall, the forecast def-
icit ratio of 1.3% for the years 2024 to 2026 
still appears plausible. The Federal Minister 
of Finance has projected a deﬁ  cit ratio of 
1.5% for 2024, which is only slightly higher.
Most of the macroeconomic variables in the 
projection will therefore not require any 
major revision. However, the higher CO₂ 
price will have a direct impact on consumer 
prices. In the baseline of the projection, it 
was still assumed that the ﬁ  xed price per 
tonne of CO₂ would be raised from cur-
rently €30 to €40 in January 2024 and to 
€50 in January 2025. The maximum price of 
€65 was assumed for 2026. In total, these 
increases would have raised the rate of the 
Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices 
(HICP) in 2024 and 2025 by approximately 0.15 percentage point for each year and in 
2026 by just over 0.2  percentage point.1 
According to the latest announcements, 
the increase in the carbon price in the com-
ing year to €45 will initially turn out to be 
more substantial, boosting the effect on the 
HICP rate by 0.1 percentage point. By 2025, 
the new carbon price should then amount 
to €55. The increase will therefore remain 
at €10, which means that the inﬂ  ationary 
effect will not change. The maximum price 
of €65 is still assumed for the last projection 
year, yet the jump to this price now turns 
out to be smaller than before. Compared to 
the baseline, the contribution to the HICP 
rate is therefore reduced by close to 0.1 per-
centage point. Other measures planned, 
such as imposing a levy on plastic products 
or a kerosene tax on domestic ﬂ  ights, are 
still too unspeciﬁ  c to permit a precise as-
sessment of their inﬂ  ationary effect. While 
the measures are likely to have a trend inﬂ  a-
tionary effect, it will probably be limited. 
Domestic ﬂ  ights, for instance, account for 
less than 0.5% of the HICP basket of goods 
and services.

Model- based recommendations for 
 monetary policy decision- making
As a result of the COVID-  19 pandemic and Russia’s unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine, 
inflation rates in the euro area reached record levels. The Governing Council of the European Cen -
tral Bank (ECB) responded to this with its strongest interest rate hiking cycle thus far since the 
introduction of the euro: since July 2022, it has raised monetary policy interest rates by a total of 
4.5 percentage points. Furthermore, in March 2023, the holdings of assets acquired under the 
asset purchase programme (APP) started to be reduced.
These monetary policy decisions reflect challenging trade- offs, as the Governing Council aims to 
fulfil its price stability mandate without creating unnecessary costs to the economy or risks to 
financial stability. For this reason, the Governing Council gathers a very comprehensive view in its 
consultations before it makes its decisions.
This article explores one of the components of this complex monetary policy decision- making 
process: model- based optimal policy projections (OPPs). In approximated form, they reflect the 
outlined policy trade- offs and, on the basis of suitable models, produce a recommended course 
of action for the path of monetary policy.
Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projection exercises represent the starting point for the calcula -
tion of OPPs and a point of reference for the monetary policy decision- making process. These 
provide a comprehensive picture of current and prospective developments in aggregate eco -
nomic activity and prices in the euro area. However, these projections are based on market 
expectations of the monetary policy interest rate. From a monetary policy decision- making stand -
point, the projections thus do not inherently make any statements regarding an optimal interest 
rate path.
Therefore, in terms of monetary policy, the key question is which monetary policy measures based 
on these projections optimally fulfil the price stability mandate. OPPs may provide an answer to 
this question: the resulting time path for monetary policy instruments is the result of an optimisa -
tion procedure intended to best achieve the objective of price stability, taking into account other 
relevant economic aspects. Here, “optimality” is always defined within the context of the respect -
ive model analyses used to determine the corresponding paths of interest rates. These analyses 
factor in assumptions on the preferences of monetary policy decision- makers; however, these 
assumptions do not necessarily reflect the actual preferences of the individual ECB Governing 
Council members.
This article outlines the use of OPPs in the monetary policy decision- making process on the basis 
of selected analyses. It discusses the need for sensitivity analyses as well as the limitations of the 
approach presented here. Despite their constraints, OPPs support and complement other, some -
times less formal, components of monetary policy decision- making. They have the advantages of 
analytical consistency and transparency. In this way, they help to rigorously test the validity of 
considerations and arguments within the monetary policy decision- making process.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
Over the past two years, the euro area has 
seen exceptionally strong surges in inflation. 
These arose from a combination of supply 
bottlenecks related to the COVID-  19 pandemic, 
a sharp increase in demand as the economy re -
opened from widespread pandemic- related 
lockdowns, and spikes in energy prices result -
ing from Russia’s unjustified war of aggression 
against Ukraine.1 Unlike inflation fuelled purely 
by demand, supply shocks pose particular chal -
lenges for monetary policy, as they drive eco -
nomic activity and inflation in different direc -
tions. This results in complex monetary policy 
trade-offs.
The ECB Governing Council, which makes 
monetary policy decisions for the euro area, re -
sponded to the far too high inflation rates with 
an unprecedented series of interest rate rises. 
Since July 2022, it has increased the interest 
rate on the deposit facility – currently the most 
relevant key interest rate for the monetary pol -
icy stance  – by 4.5  percentage points, from 
-0.5% to 4%. The aim of these decisive interest 
rate hikes is to slow down aggregate demand 
as a way of counteracting the exceptionally 
strong inflation dynamics. In doing so, the Gov -
erning Council is trying to avoid increasing 
interest rates by “too much”, as this could 
otherwise cause unnecessary costs to the econ -
omy and risks to financial stability.2 Hence, 
monetary policy decision- making has been and 
is being carried out in a macroeconomic envir -
onment that requires the Governing Council to 
walk a fine line.
This article discusses how the ECB Governing 
Council is supported in these challenging mon -
etary policy trade- offs and decision- making 
processes by model- based optimal policy pro -
jections (OPPs). In this context, OPPs are one 
component of a comprehensive analysis that 
draws on multiple economic, monetary and 
financial factors that are key to price develop -
ments in the euro area. Their role within this 
comprehensive analysis is mainly to provide a rigorous, formal perspective. Here, the starting 
point and point of reference for calculating 
OPPs is the Eurosystem staff macroeconomic 
projections, which offer a concise picture of 
current and prospective developments in ag -
gregate economic activity and prices in the 
euro area.3
Macroeconomic projections are based on the 
core assumption that the ECB Governing Coun -
cil employs its instruments in the manner ex -
pected by markets at the time the projections 
are made.4 The projections thus do not inher -
ently contain any direct or immediate recom -
mendations for monetary policy action, i.e. no 
assessment of an appropriate or even optimal 
interest rate path for monetary policy decision- 
makers. Instead, the Governing Council’s as -
sessment may differ from market expectations 
and, through its monetary policy decisions, the 
Governing Council may alter the projected path 
of key macroeconomic variables in order to ful -
fil its mandate.
This leads to the normative question of which 
monetary policy decisions contribute to opti -
mally fulfilling the price stability mandate. 
Alongside a number of individual (sub-)analyses 
that feed into the monetary policy decision-  
making process, OPPs help to provide an answer 
to this question. Amongst other things, they in -
clude optimal time paths for the future develop -
ment of monetary policy instruments (such as 
the relevant monetary policy interest rate or 
asset purchases and sales). These time paths, 
then, are the outcome of an optimisation pro -
cedure that aims to fulfil the mandate – which is 
primarily to maintain price stability over the me -Recent strong

4 The modern view of monetary policy emphasises that 
monetary policy measures achieve their impact on eco -
nomic developments largely by steering private sector ex -
pectations about future developments in inflation, output 
and interest rates (see Woodford (2003) and Svensson 
(2005)).Deutsche Bundesbank

dium term – in the best possible way. If neces -
sary, OPPs will therefore also include the optimal 
deviation of monetary policy instruments from 
market expectations.5 However, it is important 
to stress that “optimality” must be understood 
here only within the context of the employed 
model analyses and the monetary policy prefer -
ences formulated within them, and not as a 
statement on the actual preferences of the ECB 
Governing Council or its members.
It is also important to emphasise that OPPs rep -
resent just one component, albeit a noteworthy 
one, of the monetary policy decision- making 
process. OPP calculations are based on a range 
of assumptions, particularly projections for 
both economic developments and the rate of 
inflation, which are subject to considerable un -
certainty. Moreover, the calculation of OPPs 
draws on macroeconomic models that only ap -
proximate reality. For this reason, a number of 
sensitivity and scenario analyses help to verify 
the robustness of OPP outputs and are indis -
pensable when preparing monetary policy 
meetings. Despite the constraints within which 
OPPs and the underlying models are calculated, 
OPPs support and complement other, some -
times less formal, components of the monetary 
policy decision- making process. This is because 
OPPs have the advantage of being analytically 
rigorous, comparable over time, and transpar -
ent, which means they can play a part in test -
ing the soundness of considerations and argu -
ments in monetary policy decision- making.
Conceptual framework 
for deriving optimal policy 
 projections
Overview: construction of 
 optimal policy projections
Three components are needed to calculate 
OPPs:
(i)  the operationalisation of monetary policy 
target variables and their relative weighting;(ii)  the prospective paths of the target variables 
– for given market expectations regarding 
monetary policy instruments (i.e. macroeco -
nomic projections);
(iii)  the estimated transmission of monetary 
policy to these target variables.
The calculation of OPPs now centres around 
the question of how the ECB Governing Coun -
cil should employ its monetary policy instru -
ments to optimally influence the path of the 
target variables within the scope of its mandate 
(see the upper chart on p. 40).
Put simply, OPPs are calculated by adding the 
estimated impact of monetary policy instru -
ments on the target variables to the projected 
paths of these variables. Here, the use of in -
struments is selected via an optimisation pro -
cedure in such a way that the target variables 
follow an optimal path within the scope of the 
mandate.6 The lower chart on p. 40 provides a 
schematic illustration of this approach in the 
case of a monetary policy- induced rise in inter -
est rates. It depicts the fundamental trade- off 
that Eurosystem monetary policy would face 
given an unfavourable supply shock. On the 
one hand, an increase in interest rates would 
lower the rate of inflation and thus bring it 
back closer to its target value. On the other 
hand, an increase in interest rates would amp -
lify the economic downturn. When OPPs are 
calculated, these countervailing effects are 
traded off within the scope of the mandate. 
The outcome of these calculations – the opti -
mal compromise – is an optimal interest rate OPPs are based 
on assumptions 
and must 
always be 
challenged

lating OPPsConstruction

5 In some of the more recent literature on monetary policy, 
OPPs are therefore also referred to as “optimal policy per -
turbations” (Barnichon and Mesters (2023)).
6 The method for calculating optimal policy projections 
was developed in recent macroeconomic literature. See 
Svensson (2005), Svensson and Tetlow (2005), Svensson 
(2010), de Groot et al. (2021), Harrison and Waldron 
(2021), Hebden and Winkler (2021), Barnichon and Mesters 
(2023) and McKay and Wolf (2023). The method is im -
mune to the Lucas critique (Lucas (1976)), as it takes ac -
count of the fact that households and firms have individu -
ally optimal responses to current and future monetary pol -
icy impulses. In this context, “optimality” means profit or 
utility maximising.Deutsche Bundesbank

path as well as the associated paths of inflation 
and economic activity (blue lines).
Operationalisation of monetary 
policy target variables and 
their weighting
To determine the optimal time path for monet -
ary policy instruments, the calculation of OPPs 
first requires the price stability mandate to be 
operationalised (component 1 in the list pre -
sented above). This is done by selecting individ -
ual target variables and then weighting them 
to set their relative priorities in monetary policy.
The Eurosystem’s monetary policy strategy con -
siders that price stability is best maintained by 
aiming for an inflation rate of 2% over the me -
dium term.7 When calculating OPPs, the main 
target variable for monetary policy is therefore 
the deviation of inflation from its 2% target.
The focus on the medium term takes account 
of the fact that monetary policy is transmitted 
with a time lag and is thus only able to influ -
ence current economic developments to a very 
limited extent. In addition, a medium- term 
horizon for monetary policy allows for flexible 
responses when inflation rates and economic 
activity move in opposite directions. This means 
that, in principle, when the ECB Governing 
Council stabilises the rate of inflation, it does so 
not entirely without regard to economic devel -
opments. If the stabilisation of inflation is too 
narrowly interpreted, accompanied by overly 
large fluctuations in economic activity, this may 
jeopardise the inflation target over the medium 
term. From the Eurosystem’s perspective, it is 
therefore appropriate to avoid excessive fluctu -
ations in economic activity. Minimising eco -Component 1:

7 For an in- depth description of the Eurosystem’s monetary 
policy strategy, see European Central Bank (2021) and 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2021). The Governing Council’s in -
flation target of 2% is symmetric. In this context, “symmet -
ric” means that both negative and positive deviations of 
inflation from the target are considered equally undesirable 
by the Governing Council.Deutsche Bundesbank

nomic fluctuations is thus a second target vari -
able underpinning the calculation of OPPs.
Lastly, the orientation towards the medium term 
also permits the consideration of financial stabil -
ity aspects that could arise from excessive fluctu -
ations in monetary policy interest rates. In this 
context, financial stability is not a monetary pol -
icy objective in its own right, but is instead a pre -
requisite for achieving the inflation target over 
the medium term.8 Small fluctuations in interest 
rates ceteris paribus increase the certainty of 
planning for households, firms and financial 
markets, and also reduce the likelihood of sharp 
corrections in asset values. For this reason, the 
third target variable that the Bundesbank takes 
into account when calculating OPPs is the vola -
tility of the monetary policy interest rate.
Depending on the economic situation, these 
target variables may be at odds with one an -
other. One prototypical example of this is the 
impact of a supply shock that causes both 
higher inflation and an economic downturn 
(e.g. an unexpected rise in energy prices). In 
this case, the goal of combating the excessively 
high inflation following such a shock is –  all 
else being equal – at odds with the goal of pre -
venting the economic downturn from becom -
ing longer or more severe. The target variables 
therefore need to be traded off within the con -
text of monetary policy decision- making, which 
means that the target variables each have to be 
assigned suitable relative weightings.
This is done by means of a (formal) loss func -
tion, which represents the relative priority of 
each target variable within the context of the 
monetary policy mandate.9 Here, “loss” refers 
to the margin by which the monetary policy 
targets are missed. The further the target vari -
ables deviate from their target values, the 
greater the loss. The weighting assigned to the 
target variables within the loss function deter -
mines the degree to which the (squared) devi -
ations of the individual target variables from 
their respective target values affects the overall 
loss. Not only the target variables’ current val -ues, but their future values as well, are factored 
into the loss function. This intertemporal ap -
proach takes account of the fact that monetary 
policy does not act statically but rather in a dy -
namic environment, weighing current and fu -
ture developments against each other. Through 
its decisions, monetary policy only has a limited 
impact on the current (prevailing) economic 
situation. Instead, it exerts its main influence 
on future economic activity and the inflation 
rate over the medium term. This implies that a 
complex trade- off needs to be achieved: for ex -
ample, a (sharp) rise in interest rates may be 
conducive to the aim of lowering inflation in

function that can be supported directly by the monetary 
policy mandate of the Eurosystem – as shown – is used.

aim of this trade- off, then, is to stabilise the 
target variables optimally overall.
Expected development of 
 target variables and monetary 
policy interest rate
The second component in the calculation of 
OPPs is an assessment of how the target vari -
ables are likely to develop for given market ex -
pectations about the path of the monetary pol -
icy interest rate. This assessment is based on 
time series from the Eurosystem’s macroeco -
nomic projections – the (broad) macroeco -
nomic projection exercises ((B)MPEs) produced 
by Eurosystem staff on a quarterly basis.10 The 
current (B)MPE at each point in time contains 
the projected path of the inflation rate and of 
economic activity in the euro area, operational -
ised as the annual rates of change in the Har -
monised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) and 
real gross domestic product (GDP), respectively. The (B)MPE is based on, inter alia, financial 
market expectations regarding the develop -
ment of the monetary policy interest rate over 
the projection horizon at each point in time 
(see the chart on p. 41). Projections and market 
expectations derived from (B)MPEs are a key 
point of reference for the OPPs. As mentioned 
above, the OPPs answer the question of how 
the ECB Governing Council should deviate from 
these baseline time paths in order to optimally 
fulfil the monetary policy mandate (i.e. to min -
imise the loss function).
Estimated impact of monetary 
policy on target variables
The third component in the calculation of opti -
mal interest rate paths is the quantitative esti -
mation of the impact of monetary policy. In 
particular, the impact of a change in the mon -
etary policy interest rate path on the target 
variables of the loss function must be calcu -
lated. Here, the focus is on the causal effect of 
an interest rate path change for monetary pol -
icy purposes: how are target variables affected 
when monetary policy alters the interest rate 
path compared with a scenario in which it is 
left unchanged?
This question is answered in the form of im -
pulse responses, i.e. specific time paths. These 
reflect the impact of an isolated, one- time im -
pulse (in this case, a change in the interest rate) 
over a specific time horizon.11 The adjacent 
chart schematically illustrates such an impulse 
response: a (temporary) interest rate hike that 
is implemented “today” and dissipates after a 
certain amount of time will typically cause a Component 2:

(temporary) decline in the inflation rate and 
macroeconomic activity.12
A macroeconomic model is needed to quantify 
the causal effect of a change in the interest 
rate using impulse responses. This model must 
capture the relationship between the interest 
rate and other macroeconomic variables (and 
thus also the target variables) in an empirically 
plausible fashion. In principle, both purely em -
pirical, comparatively atheoretical, time series 
models (such as vector autoregressive models13) 
and more theory- based structural models (such 
as dynamic stochastic general equilibrium 
(DSGE) models) are suitable for this purpose. 
When calculating optimal interest rate paths, 
which is the primary focus of this article, DSGE 
models offer certain conceptual advantages 
over purely empirical models. In particular, the 
calculation incorporates not only the effect of 
an immediate change in interest rates (as illus -
trated in the chart on p. 42), but also the effect 
of anticipated interest rate changes at future 
points in time (sometimes referred to as “news 
shocks”).14 Whilst in monetary policy practice 
these effects can only be determined to a 
limited extent and approximately at best using 
empirical models, they can be quantified rela -
tively easily and model- consistently using DSGE 
models.15 DSGE models thus yield an analytic -
ally consistent input derived from “first prin -
ciples” for the calculation of OPPs that provide 
analytically rigorous and transparent support 
for monetary policy decision- making that is 
consistent over time.16
All the components needed for the calculation 
of OPPs are at hand, then: optimal interest rate 
paths can be calculated using the weighted tar -
get variables within the loss function, projec -
tions of the future path of the target variables, 
and the estimated impact of monetary policy.17Macroeconomic 
model captures 
impact of 
monetary  policy
12 Given empirically estimated impulse responses, the strong -
est effects of a change in the interest rate usually only occur 
with a time lag of around one to two years. See, inter alia, 
Christiano et al. (1999, 2005) and the literature that builds on 
this. See also Monetary Policy Committee, Taskforce on Rate 
Forward Guidance and Reinvestment (2022). The DSGE 
model described below reproduces such a time lag.
13 VAR models are presented and applied in, inter alia, 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2023b, 2023c). For an introduction 
to this concept, see Kilian and Lütkepohl (2017).
14 The reason for this is, to put it simply, that a (scaled) 
impulse response, as shown in the chart on p. 42, is not 
always sufficient to “hit” the best possible time path of the 
target variables. Rather, linear combinations of impulse re -
sponses to immediate and future monetary policy shocks 
are needed. See Dengler et al. (2024) for details.
15 For approaches to calculating approximate OPPs using 
empirical models, see Barnichon and Mesters (2023) and 
McKay and Wolf (2023).
16 In this context, “first principles” means the use of a gen -
eral equilibrium model that is microfounded and is built on 
maximising utility for households and profits for firms.
17 A clear distinction should be made between OPPs and time 
paths based on Taylor rules (the latter derive their name from 
the original Taylor rule (Taylor (1993)). Taylor rules are simple 
rules that describe how the interest rate is set as a function of 
different variables (current inflation and GDP are often used). 
They are usually estimated on the basis of historical data, and 
their aim is to capture monetary policy decisions as well as pos -
sible (mostly ex post). However, the Taylor rules differ funda -
mentally from OPPs in that they are not subject to any optimisa -
tion procedures. In other words, Taylor rules do not answer the 
question of how monetary policymakers should set the interest 
rate. This, in turn, is a distinguishing feature of OPPs.Market expectations of the interest rate

Illustration of optimal 
interest  rate paths for 
preparing  monetary policy 
decisions based on the June 
2023 BMPE projections
The following section presents, as an example, 
a calculation of OPPs based on the June 2023 
BMPE projections. For didactic purposes, we 
begin with the assumption that the monetary 
policy interest rate was the sole monetary pol -
icy instrument in active use by the Eurosystem 
at that time.
Macroeconomic projections, 
model and weighting of target 
variables
The macroeconomic projections for the euro 
area (hereinafter referred to as the June 2023 
BMPE) were a key component of the June 2023 
monetary policy deliberations. These provided 
the time series required for the loss function 
target variables of the OPPs. The June 2023 
BMPE projected HICP inflation rates well above 
the 2% target for multiple successive quarters. 
At the same time, the expected path of eco -
nomic activity was assessed to be relatively 
weak. This was reflected in a negative pro -
jected output gap, which operationalises eco -
nomic activity as a target variable in the con -
text of the OPP calculations.18 With regard to 
the monetary policy interest rate, operational -
ised by the interest rate on the deposit facility, 
market participants expected in June that this 
rate would rise from its level of 3.25% at that 
time to around 3.75% within the next few 
quarters.19,20 The chart on p. 43 illustrates the 
path of the three target variables over time, 
first as realised values up to the first quarter of 
2023 and thereafter as projected values ac -
cording to the June 2023 BMPE.
To calculate OPPs from the June projections, a 
representative macroeconomic DSGE model 
was used to quantify the necessary impulse re -sponses.21 The model is based on the currently 
prevailing paradigm in monetary policy analy -
sis, a New Keynesian model framework, which 
has become a standard in the academic litera -
ture and the international monetary policy de -
bate.22 The impulse responses describe how an 
interest rate increase leads – with a time lag – 
to a decline in the output gap and the inflation 
rate.23 Although analysis in the context of the 
New Keynesian model produces an aggregated 
and thus simplifying representation of monet -
ary policy transmission, it does allow for a con -
sistent derivation of monetary policy recom -
mendations based on a coherent theoretical 
framework, as stated above.
The last step is to select the weights assigned 
to the target variables in the loss function. The 
weighting assigned to deviations in the infla -Illustration of

18 The output gap is defined as the percentage deviation 
of real GDP from potential output. Potential output is cal -
culated using a production function approach as part of 
the Eurosystem’s projections. A negative output gap sug -
gests a tendency towards underutilisation of resources, 
whilst a positive output gap signals a tendency towards an 
overheating economy.
19 Here, market expectations relate to the money market 
rate (euro short- term rate (€STR)), which closely tracks the 
Eurosystem interest rate on the deposit facility (see 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2020)).
20 As the Eurosystem usually changes monetary policy 
interest rates only by (multiples of) 0.25 percentage point, 
concrete figures for interest rate time series are, in accord -
ance with this practice, rounded to the nearest possible 
monetary policy value (3.5%, 3.75%, 4%, etc.) in the fol -
lowing.
21 The parameters of this model were estimated using 
macroeconomic data from the euro area. As mentioned 
above, broadly atheoretical time series models could also 
be used, in principle. Dengler et al. (2024) document that 
the Bundesbank also calculates OPPs for other models.
22 The model contains the model blocks common in the 
literature. It is a DSGE model containing two types of 
households (those with and those without access to credit 
markets), firms experiencing pricing frictions and trade 
unions that are subject to wage- setting frictions, as well as 
a banking sector with financing frictions and a govern -
ment. Households behave with bounded rationality. For 
details, see Gerke et al. (2022) and Dobrew et al. (2023), 
and for additional applications of DSGE models in monet -
ary policy analysis, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2021).
23 Put simply, households reduce their consumption ex -
penditure in the model when the interest rate rises, as sav -
ing is more worthwhile when interest rates are higher. At 
the same time, firms invest less, as higher lending rates 
make borrowing more expensive. The reduced economic 
capacity utilisation (output gap) ultimately causes firms to 
lower their goods prices, resulting in lower inflation rates. 
Analogously, an interest rate reduction leads to higher in -
flation and increased economic activity.Deutsche Bundesbank

Monetary policy discussion in 
June 2023 and OPPs
The June 2023 BMPE illustrates a prototypical 
monetary policy trade-  off: taken in isolation, 
the inflation projection in June indicated the 
need for an even tighter monetary policy. Eco -
nomic developments, by contrast – once again 
taken in isolation – indicated that a significant 
further tightening of monetary policy was not 
warranted.
The public debate ahead of the ECB Governing 
Council’s June 2023 monetary policy meeting 
reflected this trade- off. Markets considered it 
very likely that the monetary policy interest rate 
would be raised by a further 0.25 percentage 
point to 3.5% at the meeting. But there was 
intense debate surrounding the interest rate’s 
path beyond that, particularly its peak (also 
known as the terminal rate). Back then, the 
Bundesbank’s OPP calculations indicated that 
further interest rate increases were warranted, 
including beyond the level expected by markets 
at that time. This is illustrated by the blue lines 
in the adjacent chart, which plot the optimal 
path of the monetary policy interest rate and 
the resulting OPP paths of the inflation rate and 
the output gap.25 The OPP calculations suggest 
that the optimal interest rate path initially 
tracks the path expected by markets fairly 
closely. Taken in isolation, this indicated that 
the additional interest rate step of 0.25  per -
centage point expected by the majority of the 
market should be decided at the June meeting.
Over time, however, the optimal and market-  
expected interest rates diverged. At a peak of 
around 4.25%, the optimal interest rate path at 
that time overshot the path expected by mar -
kets. This more restrictive time path would 
have contributed to lowering the high inflation 
rates more quickly (middle panel of the chart above), but at the expense of a more pro -
nounced fall in the output gap (lower panel of 
said chart). Based on this rationale, the model- 
theoretical optimisation procedure of the OPPs 
assessed the monetary policy trade- off as being 
somewhat more strongly aligned towards com -
bating inflation than implicitly suggested by 
market expectations. At the same time, an 
even larger direct interest rate step of 0.5 per -
centage point in June would not have been op -
timal from the perspective of the OPP calcula -
tions. While this would have lowered the infla -
tion path further still, it would have done the 
same with the output gap. For the chosen Public debate

sensitivity analysis is carried out on pp. 48 ff. in which the

function varies.

weighting of the target variables, this would 
have worsened the value of the loss func -
tion.26,27 Lastly, not raising interest rates at all 
or announcing the end of interest rate hikes at 
the market-  expected level of around 3.75% 
would have likewise worsened the value of the 
loss function.
The takeaway from the OPPs for the ECB Gov -
erning Council’s June 2023 meeting, then, was 
that there was a case for monetary policy to 
further increase the interest rate from 3.25% to 
3.5% and that further increases of the interest 
rate in future should not be ruled out.
Alignment of market 
expectations  and optimal 
interest rate paths
The optimal interest rate path and the one ex -
pected by financial markets were closely 
aligned at the beginning of the projection period, but that has not always been the case 
in the past two years. Rather, the very high in -
flation rates – particularly at their peak in au -
tumn 2022 and based on the Bundesbank’s 
OPP calculations – generally made a tightening 
of monetary policy that was stronger and faster 
than expected by markets appear to be war -
ranted. The adjacent chart illustrates this and 
compares market expectations and projections 
from the December 2022 BMPE with the opti -
mal interest rate paths calculated internally by 
the Bundesbank at the time. On the one hand, 
it becomes clear that the interest rate path ex -
pected by financial markets was still quite low 
at the time, with a peak of 3%. Given the very 
high inflation rates, the optimal interest rate 
path calculated then was significantly higher 
(peak of 5.5%). On the other hand, unlike the 
picture in June 2023, the optimal interest rate 
path was already inclining considerably more 
steeply towards its peak at an early stage. 
Taken together, these factors would have led 
to a faster decline in the inflation rate, albeit 
accompanied by a stronger decline in macro -
economic activity than projected at the time by 
the BMPE based on market expectations.28
Sensitivity analyses and 
 scenarios in monetary policy 
decision- making
Calculating optimal interest rate paths hinges 
on numerous factors, particularly the under -
lying projections or the prioritisation of monet -
ary policy objectives. We will therefore illustrate Optimal interest

26 The incorporation of financial stability risks, operational -
ised by the smallest possible changes in interest rates, also 
suggested that the interest rate path should be as “smooth” 
as possible and therefore that an even greater increase in 
interest rates was not warranted.
27 The choice of weights is discussed on pp. 45f.
28 The maximum of the optimal monetary policy interest 
rate in the June 2023 calculation is significantly lower than 
in December 2022. This is mainly on account of the inten -
tion to smooth the interest rate. As the interest rate was 
not raised as quickly and significantly as was suggested in 
the December 2022 OPPs, it “only” stood at 3.25% in June 
2023. The December 2022 OPPs had already set the inter -
est rate higher than 5% at this point in time, allowing it to 
slowly fall again shortly thereafter.Deutsche Bundesbank

below how sensitivity and scenario analyses 
can be used to test the robustness of the de -
rived optimal interest rate paths. Here, “robust -
ness” means that the optimal interest rate path 
does not change significantly if at least one of 
the underlying assumptions is changed.29
On the sensitivity of 
 projections
Euro area monetary policy operates in a con -
stantly evolving and thus uncertain environ -
ment. In terms of the OPPs, uncertainty is pri -
marily inherent in macroeconomic projections. 
By construction, these projections are based on 
a variety of assumptions – such as on the fu -
ture path of oil and energy prices, expected ex -
change rates and assumptions regarding wage 
developments and corporate profits. There is a 
high probability that the assumptions will not 
materialise as expected, meaning that the 
paths of HICP inflation rates and the output 
gap will diverge from those projected by Euro -
system staff. Hence, future developments that 
deviate from the projections can lead to differ -
ent monetary policy conclusions.
It is common for alternative scenarios to be 
analysed and discussed as a way of explicitly 
factoring projection uncertainty into monetary 
policy deliberations.30 We assume below, for il -
lustrative purposes, that energy prices or wages 
rise more strongly than assumed in the June 
2023 BMPE, both of which would lead to even 
higher inflation rates than those projected in 
the BMPE. However, whether or not this dir -
ectly results in a tighter monetary policy stance, 
expressed as a steeper interest rate path, de -
pends in part on the assumptions made in 
these alternative scenarios regarding the other 
variables in the loss function, particularly eco -
nomic developments. In the stylised alternative 
scenario described below, higher wage and en -
ergy costs lead to higher goods prices and even 
weaker economic growth, causing the output 
gap to decline further. The light blue lines in 
the upper two panels of the chart on p.  48 show how the alternative scenario contrasts 
with the baseline scenario.
The three lower panels of the chart on p. 48 
show the optimal path of the monetary policy 
interest rate, as well as the resulting OPPs of 
the inflation rate and the output gap, and com -
pare them with the baseline scenario.
The monetary policy trade- off in this alternative 
scenario is even more acute than in the base -
line scenario. The higher inflation rates require, 
taken in isolation, an even higher interest rate 
path, while the more strongly negative output 
gap –  taken in isolation  – calls for a flatter 
interest rate path. Just how the trade- off can 
be optimally resolved depends on the relative 
weights in the loss function (which are dis -
cussed in the next section) and the specific 
time paths for the output gap and inflation 
rate. In the alternative scenario presented here, 
optimal monetary policy implies a tighter tra -
jectory: the optimal interest rate path in the al -
ternative scenario (light blue dashed line in the 
third panel of the chart on p.  48) peaks at 
around 5%, leaving it roughly 0.75 percentage 
point above the peak of the optimal interest 
rate path in the baseline scenario described 
above (dark blue dashed line). The tighter mon -
etary policy stance causes inflation to fall more 
sharply (light blue bar in the fourth panel) and 
a more strongly negative output gap (bottom 
panel) than in the baseline scenario.Sensitivity ana -

Sensitivity with respect to the 
weights in the loss function
The weights in the loss function express, in a 
highly condensed form, the prioritisation of 
monetary policy target variables – especially if a 
trade-  off needs to be made between object -
ives. However, in monetary policy practice, 
using a loss function entails challenges. One is 
that a specific weighting of target variables 
cannot be unambiguously derived from the Eu -
rosystem’s mandate. Another is that a single 
concrete weighting of target variables in the 
loss function, when done in isolation, can only 
approximate and hence incompletely describe 
how the ECB Governing Council achieves an 
optimal trade- off within the meaning of its 
monetary policy mandate. One way of better 
capturing these complex trade- offs in model 
theory is therefore to vary the weights of the 
loss function. This way, alternative OPPs can be 
generated. Constructing alternative OPPs offers 
the advantage of allowing the monetary policy 
trade- offs to be made from complementary 
perspectives. Above and beyond that, Euro -
system decision- makers are also able to discuss 
alternative policy projections that were not 
constructed as OPPs.31 In this sense, then, there 
is a certain degree of discretion when choosing 
the weights of the target variables. Therefore, 
to give greater regard to the ECB Governing 
Council’s considerations and trade- offs, it is 
standard practice to calculate alternative OPP 
paths when generating OPPs, based on differ -
ent weightings being assigned to the target 
variables in the loss function.
As already explained, an initial benchmark cal -
culation (baseline analysis) generally applies 
weights that are commonplace in the academic 
literature. From these are derived the already-  
shown OPPs, which are depicted once again in Sensitivity analy -
sis with regard 
to the weight of 
the output gapOptimal policy projections (OPPs) for the

need not always nor necessarily be consistent across vari -

the adjacent chart by the solid dark blue lines 
and bars. If the weight of the output gap is 
now varied based on the June 2023 BMPE, we 
can see how this affects the OPPs for the mon -
etary policy interest rate, output gap and infla -
tion rate.32
If monetary policy gives the output gap a lower 
weight (“hawkish”), it would be willing to tol -
erate a stronger economic downturn in order 
to achieve price stability. Thus, the optimal 
interest rate path in the adjacent chart in the 
“hawkish” scenario (blue thick dashed line) 
peaks at around 5%. That is 0.75 percentage 
point more than in the baseline analysis and 
around 1.25 percentage points more than ex -
pected by markets in June 2023 (black line). A 
tighter monetary policy stance of that kind 
brings about, with a time lag, stronger disinfla -
tion and thus a faster return to the inflation tar -
get. It also leads, however, to a more strongly 
negative output gap than had been projected 
in the June BMPE.
Similarly, OPPs can be calculated based on a 
high relative weight being assigned to the sta -
bilisation of the output gap (light blue fine 
dashed line; “dovish”). That kind of weighting 
would specifically avoid a stronger decline in 
the output gap, but at the same time, the infla -
tion rate would return to target more slowly 
than in the baseline analysis (light blue bars in 
the middle panel of the adjacent chart). In this 
case, the optimal interest path does not sur -
pass the 3.5% mark.
Incorporation of additional 
monetary policy instruments
Thus far, we have assumed, for the sake of sim -
plicity, that the ECB Governing Council has only 
a single instrument, the interest rate. This as -
sumption is not strictly necessary, as the meth -
odology for calculating OPPs is flexible enough 
to accommodate multiple instruments – pro -
vided, however, that it is possible to measure 
the impact of each instrument on the econ -omy, i.e. the corresponding impulse responses, 
using a macroeconomic model.33

32 Comparable sensitivity analyses can be conducted in 
the same way for the weighting of interest rate changes in 
the loss function.
33 The DSGE model explained above can model not only 
the impact of conventional interest rate policy measures 
but also the impact of central bank asset purchases or sales 
on economic activity and inflation. It is therefore suitable 
for deriving optimal paths for multiple monetary policy in -

mand and bring the inflation rate closer to the 
2% target. Two of the most important pur -
chase programmes in the euro area are the 
asset purchase programme (APP), which was 
officially launched in March 2015, and the pan -
demic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), 
which was announced and implemented in 
March 2020 in response to the COVID-  19 pan -
demic.34 In a high- inflation environment, these 
programmes are gradually being phased out. 
Thus, as of June 2023, the principal payments 
from maturing securities purchased under the 
APP are no longer being reinvested, while re -
investments under the PEPP are scheduled to 
be discontinued at the end of 2024.
A reduction of the assets held on the central 
bank’s balance sheet contributes to a tight 
monetary policy stance and has a correspond -
ingly dampening impact on inflation and eco -
nomic activity.35 In principle, then, a (stronger) 
reduction in asset holdings could substitute po -
tential interest rate hikes. When calculating 
OPPs, we can therefore also investigate the ex -
tent to which an accelerated reduction of asset 
holdings adds to the impact of potential inter -
est rate hikes or even renders them unneces -
sary.
To illustrate this point, let us assume that PEPP 
reinvestments are discontinued in Q4 2023 – that is, earlier than the Q4 2024 expiry date 
expected by most market participants in June. 
The adjacent chart shows the alternative path 
of the asset holdings compared with the path 
expected by markets at the time. In the present 
example, ending reinvestments earlier has a 
comparatively small impact on the expected re -
duction path for asset holdings.36 As house -
holds and firms, bearing this in mind, expect 
only a marginally tighter monetary policy stance 
with regard to the reduction path, they would 
reduce their consumer expenditure and invest -
ment, respectively, only marginally in the con -
text of the macroeconomic model. Accordingly, 
this would entail a comparatively minor impact 
on the inflation rate, economic activity and the 
optimal interest rate path.37 This would be less 
than 0.1 percentage point below the optimal 
interest rate path shown in the previous sec -
tion, for the calculation of which only the inter -
est rate was permitted as a monetary policy 
instrument. It could therefore be concluded 
from this alternative calculation that ending 
PEPP reinvestments earlier, taken in isolation, 
could have contributed to a tighter monetary 
policy stance. However, the macroeconomic ef -
fects would have been comparatively minor, 
meaning that a further interest rate hike would 
still have been appropriate from a monetary 
policy perspective.Effects of the

34 The APP was launched at the effective lower bound on 
interest rates as an additional expansionary instrument in 
an era of a subdued inflation outlook and falling inflation -
ary expectations. The PEPP was introduced in response to 
the COVID-  19 pandemic and its economic fallout in order 
to prop up financing conditions and ensure economic sta -
bility during the crisis.
35 This takes place through a variety of channels. For a 
discussion of the channels, see, for example, Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2016). One key channel, the announcement 
effect (also known as the stock effect) is discussed in Gerke 
et al. (2022).
36 The primary reason for the small impact on the ex -
pected reduction path is that only a small volume of assets 
are affected by the premature end of reinvestments relative 
to the stock of assets still held by the Eurosystem.
37 To isolate the effect of the presented alternative reduc -
tion path on the optimum interest rate in the model, the 
deviation of this alternative reduction path from market ex -
pectations is fed into the model. So, although in formal 
terms two monetary policy instruments – the interest rate 
and asset holdings – are available in this analysis, only the 
time path for the interest rate is optimally chosen.Deutsche Bundesbank

Conclusion
Building on the Eurosystem’s quarterly projec -
tions, macroeconomic models can be used to 
derive OPPs that aim to optimally fulfil the Eu -
rosystem’s monetary policy mandate. Here, 
OPPs serve as a basis for discussion and sup -
port decision- making in the context of the 
complex process of preparing monetary policy 
decisions. Their key advantage lies in allowing 
the monetary policy trade- off process to be 
modelled consistently by describing the opti -
mal compromise between monetary policy 
trade- offs from the standpoint of model theory.
The calculation of OPPs as an input in monet -
ary policy decision- making feeds not only into 
the monetary policy discussions within the 
Bundesbank or the Eurosystem. Other central 
banks, too, such as the US Federal Reserve, the 
Bank of England, Norges Bank and Sveriges 
Riksbank, calculate and publish OPPs for their 
respective currency areas.38 Common to all of 
them is that they emphasise the utility of OPPs 
in monetary policy decision-  making, yet are 
also cognisant of the risks associated with 
overreliance on the monetary policy implica -
tions they involve.39 OPPs do not serve as a dir -
ect recommendation for a specific course of 
action in monetary policy decision- making, as 
they are naturally based on assumptions whose 
realisation is uncertain. Accordingly, there is an 
inherent uncertainty about OPPs that monetary 
policy decision- makers must bear in mind.
For example, it is effectively assumed when cal -
culating OPPs that the macroeconomic projec -
tion will actually materialise. Uncertainty sur -
rounding the macroeconomic projections is 
therefore disregarded initially, though it can, as 
explained above, generally be taken into ac -
count using sensitivity analyses. There is also 
some discretionary scope as to how precisely 
the ECB Governing Council achieves the opti -
mal trade- off between the monetary policy tar -
get variables. In other words: there is a degree 
of uncertainty surrounding monetary policy 
decision- makers’ priorities (i.e. ultimately the weights assigned within the loss function). For 
that reason, it is generally a good idea to test 
the robustness of the results in this regard.
Moreover, there is, in principle, a degree of un -
certainty about the functioning and strength of 
monetary policy at a given point in time, some -
thing the ECB Governing Council particularly 
highlighted in the context of its most recent 
decisions.40 The impulse responses used to cal -
culate OPPs initially reflect the cause- and- effect 
relationships observed in the past. Any change 
in the cause- and- effect relationships when cal -
culating OPPs can therefore only be considered 
to an approximate degree.41 The same applies 
for non- linear transmission channels of monet -
ary policy decisions.42
Given that a raft of assumptions are used to 
underpin OPPs, they should therefore only be 
regarded as a contribution, albeit a notable 
one, to the monetary policy decision- making 
process. The comparative advantage of OPPs 
over other analyses carried out in the decision- 
making process lies in their analytical rigour 
and transparency with regard to the assump -OPPs represent

38 The Federal Reserve’s Tealbooks, which contain an an -
alysis of the US economy and descriptions of monetary pol -
icy alternatives, likewise derive optimal interest rate paths. 
For examples, see Board of Governors of the Federal Re -
serve System (2017). Calculations of optimal interest rate 
paths likewise feed into the monetary policy decision-  
making discussions of the Bank of England’s MPC; see 
Broadbent (2022).
39 As Broadbent (2022) puts it: “One should always take 
the OPPs with a healthy dose of salt.”
40 See, for example, the press release following the ECB 
Governing Council meeting of 26 October 2023: “The Gov -
erning Council’s past interest rate increases continue to be 
transmitted forcefully into financing conditions.”
41 For example, in a first step, a steeper Phillips curve, as 
documented by Benigno and Eggertsson (2023), can be 
diagnosed using a (separate) time- varying VAR estimate. In 
the second step, the parameters of the DSGE model can be 
adapted such that the resulting impulse responses reflect 
the potentially altered monetary policy impact.
42 Thus, for one thing, unusually strong (or a particularly 
rapid succession of) interest rate increases can contribute 
to firmly anchoring economic agents’ inflation expectations 
and to preventing them from being a cause of high actual 
inflation rates themselves. For another, unusually strong 
interest rate increases could trigger strong adjustments in 
financial markets and themselves represent a risk to finan -
cial intermediaries. The latter risk of a non- linear transmis -
sion channel (not explicitly incorporated into the model) is, 
as already explained, approximated via the preference for 
small interest rate fluctuations.Deutsche Bundesbank

tions made and the prioritisation of objectives. 
That said, OPPs are not direct recommenda -
tions for monetary policy actions but serve as a 
basis for discussion and a point of reference for 
monetary policy decision-  makers. OPPs help 
monetary policy decision- makers estimate, in a 
coherent and consistent fashion, the impact of monetary policy alternatives on the expected 
development of the economy and the achieve -
ment of the monetary policy objective. Through 
this, OPPs can also contribute to an improved 
assessment of the proportionality of monetary 
policy decisions.

German enterprises’ profitability and 
 financing during the 2022 energy crisis
The energy crisis and high- inflation environment impacted on non- financial enterprises’ profitabil -
ity in 2022. Materials costs soared as prices of intermediate goods and energy skyrocketed, while 
sales saw exceptionally robust growth. These developments left the pre- tax profit margin only 
slightly lower at 4.5%, but still well up on its long- term average. This would suggest that the in 
part huge cost increases have been largely passed on to customers.
Dramatic upticks in gas, electricity and crude oil prices in 2022 barely impacted on profitability in 
energy- intensive sectors. Only the chemicals and pharmaceutical industry saw net earnings shrink 
noticeably – albeit from a record level in the previous year. That industry and, to a limited extent, 
the wood, paper and printing industry, had a higher need for liquidity as well, but this was not 
detrimental to balance sheet stability. Overall, energy- intensive sectors coped well with the imme -
diate financial fallout from the energy price shock at first.
The primary outcome for enterprises of the monetary policy tightening in 2022 was an increase 
in the cost of external funds and of servicing new liabilities. The staggered maturity profile of 
existing liabilities and the gradual increase in the key interest rate mean that the monetary policy 
impulse is being transmitted with something of a lag, and will only impact fully on enterprises’ 
profitability and financing in 2023 and 2024. Germany’s corporate sector is in good shape over -
all, in terms of its profitability, liquidity and stability, to rise to the challenges presented by the 
reversal of interest rates.
With the economy experiencing a bout of weakness, the energy crisis is likely to have greater 
effects on enterprises’ costs in their 2023 annual financial statements than it did in 2022. The 
increased energy costs are still weighing primarily on energy- intensive industry. Moreover, output 
in export- driven parts of the economy, and thus above all manufacturing sales, is also suffering 
from lacklustre foreign demand. In addition, cost- side pressures are likely to remain intense owing 
to high wage settlements and increased funding costs across all sectors. On balance, these fac -
tors will probably weigh more heavily on enterprises’ profitability in 2023.Deutsche Bundesbank

Underlying trends
The German economy shrugged off the critical 
developments in energy markets brought about 
by Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine 
and expanded significantly in 2022. Buoyed by 
catch- up effects, real gross domestic product 
grew by a calendar- adjusted 1.9% on the year. 
As the year progressed, however, activity de -
teriorated, particularly on the back of sharply 
higher energy prices. On balance, this left Ger -
man economic output still lagging behind its 
medium- term aggregate production capacity in 
2022. But the below- potential output level was 
due not to an absence of aggregate demand, 
but in part to a variety of supply- side disrup -
tions. These were transitory in nature and did 
more to dampen supply than demand in many 
sectors, driving strong price increases. The Bun -
desbank’s concept of potential output, by con -
trast, is geared to a medium- term horizon, 
which means that it has limited scope to cap -
ture short- term supply effects of that kind. 
What is more, subdued demand and consider -
able increases in energy costs left German ex -
porters operating amid less favourable global 
conditions. With most pandemic restrictions 
being phased out, private consumption regis -
tered substantial gains, while business invest -
ment also rose significantly on the year. But 
even so, construction investment continued to 
decline owing to higher construction and fund -
ing costs. Fiscal policy remained supportive, 
though somewhat less so than in the previous 
two years on account of the gradual rollback of 
government coronavirus support measures, 
which were replaced in part by extensive new 
measures addressing the energy crisis and high 
inflation.
Judging by the annual financial statements we 
currently have on file, the 2022 pre- tax profit 
margin, at 4.5%, was slightly down on the pre -
vious year’s very high 5.1%, but still well up on 
the long- term average.1 Materials costs soared 
as prices of intermediate goods and energy 
skyrocketed. However, it would appear that the 
in part huge cost increases were largely passed on to customers, with the result that corporate 
sales likewise saw exceptionally robust growth 
and profitability did not suffer unduly. Profits 
remained high in 2022, and this is likely to have 
played a not inconsiderable role in the inflation 
observed last year.2 The cost of materials was 
not the only expense item that increased; per -
sonnel expenses were also driven higher by 
staff growth, strong wage rises and other fac -
tors.3 On the income side, other operating in -
come saw significant growth, just as it had 
done in the previous two years.
With profitability still high and capital adequacy 
remaining sound, corporate insolvencies saw 
only a slight uptick in 2022 on a broad sectoral 
basis, leaving them at a very low level by histor -
ical standards. Corporate insolvencies had bot -
tomed out in the previous year, partly on ac -
count of the temporary suspension, subject to 
certain conditions, of the requirement to file 
for insolvency.

sure.4 Data from the Federal Statistical Office 
show that output in energy- intensive industries 
was down by around 7% on an annual aver -
age, with output at year- end even lagging al -
most one- fifth behind the previous year’s level. 
This decline was particularly evident in the 
chemicals industry, while manufacturers of 
metals suffered somewhat smaller losses in 
output. The annual financial statements on file 
deliver key insights into how the energy crisis 
impacted on liquidity, stability and profitability 
in the corporate sector as a whole and in spe -
cific sectors.
The energy crisis barely impacted on profitabil -
ity and liquidity or solvency levels in the corpor -
ate sector in 2022. The cost of materials rose 
dramatically, in part due to higher energy costs, 
but profitability was hardly affected – probably, 
in first order, because the costs were largely 
passed on to customers.5 There was also an 
uptick in other operating income, chiefly on the 
back of one- off factors in the chemicals and pharmaceutical industry. Unlike in previous 
years of crisis, liquidity requirements did not 
generally increase, as firms chose to dip into 
the liquidity reserves they had set aside during 
the pandemic. The stability metrics exhibited 
broadly similar patterns as well, with the long- 
term debt ratio, amongst others, continuing to 
recede. The equity ratio was the only metric to 
deteriorate, mainly due to the soaring cost of 
intermediate inputs, which drove up the figure 
for trade payables, advance payments received 
on account of orders and, in some cases, liabil -
ities to affiliated companies.

high level of energy intensity that is sourced almost exclu -
sively from refined petroleum products, though German 
enterprises are likely to face fewer drawbacks in this area 
than international competitors.

Extrapolated data from the corporate annual 
financial statement statistics can also be used 
to draw conclusions about developments in 
energy- intensive industrial sectors.6 As ex -
pected, materials costs rose more strongly in 
energy- intensive sectors than elsewhere in the 
corporate sector. The chemicals and pharma -
ceutical industry, which operates in a fiercely 
competitive international environment, appears 
to have had less scope to hike prices than other 
sectors. So although this sector saw its other 
operating income increase significantly, the 
gross profit margin was 4  percentage points 
down on the previous year’s record level. How -
ever, this is likely to have been due, at least in 
part, to the pharmaceutical industry’s profits 
returning to normal levels after the boost they 
had been given by the coronavirus pandemic. 
Despite the decline, sector profitability was 
close to its long- term average. The general pat -
terns shown by liquidity and stability metrics 
were also reflected to a large degree in energy- 
intensive sectors. Only the chemicals and 
pharmaceutical industry and, to a limited ex -
tent, the wood, paper and printing industry 
saw their liquidity requirements increase.
Energy- intensive sectors thus coped well, for 
the most part, with the direct financial impact 
of the energy price shock.7 Declines in energy 
prices plus action to cap businesses’ gas and electricity prices will probably make a further 
contribution this year. But even so, the in -
creased energy costs are dragging on Germa -
ny’s corporate sector. With energy prices likely 
to remain permanently higher than both pre-  
energy- crisis levels and prices in other large 
economic areas like the United States, Bundes -
bank estimates suggest that they will continue 
to noticeably dampen the German economy’s 
potential output in the coming years.8

sectors relates to sectoral aggregates that also include 
other (non- energy- intensive) sectors. The extrapolated data 
for 2022, however, show that energy-  intensive industrial 
sectors accounted for between around four- tenths and 
three- quarters of the respective sectoral aggregates.

f March 2022 and the end of June 2022, re -
spectively. The interest rate decision of 21 July 
2022 set the reversal of interest rates in mo -
tion, with the monetary policy deposit facility 
rate gradually increasing from -0.5% to 2% at 
year-  end 2022 and to 4% by 20  September 
2023. These interest rates had been very low 
since the 2008-09 economic and financial cri -
sis. The primary outcome of the monetary pol -
icy tightening for enterprises is an increase in 
the cost of external funds and of servicing new 
liabilities. Taken in isolation, this narrows the 
scope for investment. How the interest rate re -
versal impacts on enterprises’ financing struc -
ture depends primarily on the ratio of liabilities 
to equity, the maturity profile of existing debt, 
and the extent to which enterprises can service 
interest costs out of their current receipts or 
liquidity reserves.
The interest rate channel ranks as the key trans -
mission channel of monetary policy. The pass-  
through of interest rates by banks to enter -
prises is of crucial importance, especially in 
Germany’s bank- based financial system. The 
pace and degree of this transmission depends 
on the maturity structure of liabilities and the 
importance of bank liabilities. Interest- bearing 
short- term liabilities maturing in less than one 
year accounted for 27% of total assets in the 
reporting year, and long- term liabilities (matur -
ing in over one year) for 13%.9 Viewed through 
the lens of enterprises’ capital structure, it 
therefore stands to reason that around two-  
thirds of the interest rate hike will be passed 
through to enterprises within the space of a 
year when existing liabilities are renewed at the 
new interest rate conditions. Sectors such as 
trade in motor vehicles and motorcycles, motor 
vehicle manufacturers and the chemicals and 
pharmaceutical industry, which have a higher 
share of interest-  bearing short- term liabilities, 
may thus feel the impact of the interest rate 
reversal sooner.Two- thirds of

9 Interest- bearing short- term liabilities are short- term liabil -
ities excluding trade payables as well as advance payments 
received on account of orders, which typically do not entail 
interest expenditure.Deutsche Bundesbank

In the case of liabilities to banks in particular, 
the monetary policy impulse could be passed 
on relatively directly in the form of interest rate 
spreads. Bank debt as a percentage of total 
assets, which has declined significantly over the 
past two decades, only came to around 10% in 
the reporting year. Hence, the percentage of 
liabilities to affiliated companies was higher, at 
just over 23% of total assets. Viewed from this 
angle, the hotel and restaurant sector, trade in 
motor vehicles and motorcycles, the energy 
sector, transportation and storage, and the re -
tail trade – all sectors with an above average 
ratio of bank liabilities to total assets – could be affected particularly strongly by the interest 
rate reversal.
All in all, Germany’s total corporate sector is in 
good shape overall, in terms of its profitability, 
liquidity and stability, to rise to the challenges 
presented by the reversal of interest rates. In 
addition, some enterprises are likely to benefit 
in the coming years from relief on the pension 
obligations front as the interest rate used for 
discounting purposes notches up again. Even 
so, mounting interest costs in the years ahead 
can be expected to erode profits at most enter -
prises and significantly increase the cost of cap -
ital expenditure and debt servicing.Enterprises’

Sales and income
Non- financial enterprises’ sales saw exception -
ally strong growth in 2022, significantly sur -
passing even the rate of growth registered in 
2021, which had previously been the strongest 
increase observed since records began back in 
1997. Two factors will probably have been at 
play here: the continued impact of post-  
pandemic catch- up effects, and the fact that 
higher prices played a more significant role in 
the increase in sales than volume growth, as 
was the case in the previous year.10 Sales prices 
of goods and services rose considerably and 
even more strongly than in the previous year. The onset of the interest rate reversal also 
pushed interest income significantly higher. 
Other operating income rose sharply, just as it 
had done in the crisis year of 2020, and re -
mained at a high level relative to sales. Devel -
opments at enterprises from the chemicals and 
pharmaceutical industry and transport equip -
ment manufacturers accounted for much of 
this.

creased energy prices brought on by the en -
ergy crisis. The hotel and restaurant sector re -
corded the second- highest increase in sales. 
With pandemic- related restrictions still in force 
in 2021, the post- pandemic catch- up process in 
the hotel and restaurant sector only began in 
2022. The strong increases in food prices are 
also likely to have played a part in the higher 
sales numbers. Other services sectors, such as 
transportation and storage, wholesale trade 
and business service providers, also saw their 
sales grow considerably. Within the manufac -
turing sector, sales grew most strongly in the 
metal industry, the wood, paper and printing industry, and the food industry. These are also 
industrial and services sectors in which price in -
creases are likely to have played a significant 
role.
Non- financial enterprises’ profits remained at a 
high, stable level in 2022 in spite of the imme -
diate impact of the energy crisis. As overall ex -
penditure rose roughly as strongly as income, 
the annual result before taxes was more or less 
the same as it had been in the previous year, 
which would suggest that enterprises largely 
passed on the increased costs to customers.

prices of intermediate goods and energy, while 
personnel expenses also rose sharply as a result 
of staff growth, strong wage increases and in -
creased pension provisions.11 Interest expend -
iture rose considerably as well, probably on the 
back of the increased funding costs brought 
about by the monetary policy interest rate re -
versal in combination with the additional provi -
sions set aside for pension obligations.12 Other 
expenses also increased considerably, in line 
with the strong sales growth.
Sources and uses of funds
On the revenue side, the large volume of add -
itional funds was sourced internally and exter -
nally in roughly equal parts. Internal financing 
increased as a result of depreciation and trans -
fers to provisions. External financing grew 
mainly owing to the considerable expansion of 
short- term liabilities. In contrast to the previous 
year, however, long- term liabilities were like -
wise built up again. Looking at the uses of 
funds, expenditure on non- financial assets in -
creased sharply again as a result of strong 
stockpiling. Growth in tangible fixed assets ac -
celerated further and was actually significantly 
greater than in the pre- crisis year of 2019. As in 
the previous year, the bulk of the sharp in -
crease in financial asset formation came from 
the acquisition of additional short- term receiva -
bles. The build- up of liquidity in the form of 
cash moderated somewhat again.
Balance sheet developments
In line with the high sales growth, the total 
assets of non-  financial enterprises expanded 
considerably in 2022. As with sales, the in -
crease in total assets, at 10.9%, was larger than 
in the previous record year, 2021. In addition to 
the effects of the energy crisis, rebound effects 
after the crisis year of 2020 are likely still to 
have been a factor in some cases. On the assets 
side, the share of financial assets in total assets 
fell slightly. Following the decline in the two Sources and

11 The strong uptick in recognised pension provisions in 
2022 is largely due to the sharp decline in the fair values of 
assets offset against pension obligations (pursuant to Section 
246(2) sentence 2 of the German Commercial Code ( Han-
delsgesetzbuch )). Overall, the weak bond and equity markets 
in 2022 could be partly responsible for the decline in fair 
values. The post- employment benefit obligations themselves, 
by contrast, saw only moderate growth in 2022 by historical 
standards. Some of the strong year- on- year increase in 
wages can be traced back to the decline in short- time work.
12 Section 253(2) of the Commercial Code requires provi -
sions for post- employment benefit obligations with a re -
sidual maturity of more than one year to be discounted at 
the average market interest rate of the past ten financial 
years according to their residual maturity. Because of this 
averaging, the strong rise in central bank interest rates only 
has a lagged effect on the discount rate and thus on enter -
prises’ pension provisions. In fact, the discount rate applied 
under the Commercial Code fell slightly, dropping from 
1.87% as at 31 December 2021 to 1.78% as at year- end 
2022. As a result, the monetary policy reversal is only likely 
to be a source of relief in future periods.Deutsche Bundesbank

Adjustments to the international supply chains of German 
fi  rms and impact on their production costs
In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic 
and the Russian war of aggression against 
Ukraine, disruptions to international supply 
chains became a widespread phenomenon, 
affecting numerous economic sectors and 
countries. There has also been an increase 
in protectionist measures and geopolitical 
tensions in the recent past, particularly be-
tween China and western countries.1 Ac-
cording to existing surveys, fi  rms have re-
sponded to these developments by introdu-
cing measures to strengthen the resilience 
of their supply chains.2 However, there is 
still little insight into the impact of these ini-
tiatives on production costs. Cost increases 
and their pass- through to customers also 
determine how fi  rms’ profi  tability and sales 
prices develop.In the Bundesbank Online Panel – Firms 
(BOP- F) conducted in the third quarter of 
2023, the Bundesbank asked around 8,400 
firms about their international supply 
chains, measures to restructure them and 
the associated costs. According to this sur-
vey, around 50% of fi  rms obtained products 
via international supply routes.3 When 
asked about the most signifi  cant regions for 
global supply relationships, around 90% of 
the fi  rms named the EU (excluding Ger-
many), 40% China, and just under 25% the 
rest of Europe (i.e. excluding the EU).4 On 
the one hand, these responses indicate the 
key role played by the European single mar-
ket for the cross- border supply chains of 
German fi  rms. On the other, they show the 
signifi  cance of China, which is, moreover,  
somewhat more pronounced still in the 
manufacturing sector.5
Almost 60% of fi  rms have introduced at 
least one measure since 2021 to improve 
the reliability of their international supply 
chains.6 The most important measures here 
were the expansion of supply networks 
through additional suppliers, the expansion 
of storage capacity, the replacement of for-
mer suppliers with new ones and improved 
monitoring of supply chains. In addition, 
1 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2023e).
2 According to a survey carried out by the ifo Institute 
in July 2022, almost 90% of German manufacturing 
fi  rms initiated measures to adjust their supply chains 
following the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic; 
see Aksoy et al. (2022).
3 The following analysis relates to fi  rms with inter-
national supply chains.
4 Other regions named included Asia excluding China 
(17%), North America (11%) and other regions (5%).
5 For more on the importance of China as a supplier of 
key intermediate goods, see Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2023f).
6 Just under 30% of fi  rms introduced three or more 
measures.Measures to improve the reliability of

around 40% of fi  rms planned to introduce 
further measures by the end of the coming 
year. Shorter delivery routes and a shift in 
the regional focus among current suppliers 
are also expected to play an important role 
here. The proportion of fi  rms that have al-
ready implemented measures and intend to 
do so in the future is highest in the manu-
facturing sector. Furthermore, manufactur-
ing fi  rms typically took more measures than 
fi  rms active in other sectors.
It is also worth noting that fi  rms for which 
China played a key role in international sup-
ply chains implemented more measures or 
planned to do so in the near future than 
fi  rms with a supply chain focus on the EU 
(excluding Germany). This is consistent with 
the results of another survey conducted in 
the second quarter of this year, according 
to which some fi  rms sourcing critical inputs 
from China are switching to alternative sup-
ply sources.7
It is therefore clear that German fi  rms are 
attempting to make their supply relation-
ships more reliable. In all likelihood, these 
measures are also having an impact on the 
production costs of fi  rms.8 According to the 
survey, 45% of German fi  rms anticipate cost 
increases as a result of supply chain adjust-
ments. Almost one- fi  fth of these fi  rms ex-
pect these measures to increase their pro-
duction costs – not insignifi  cantly – by 5% 
or more. Firms tend to expect the highest 
cost increases for measures that signifi  -
cantly change the structure of their supplier 
network (shift of regional focus, replace-
ment of former suppliers with new ones). In 
contrast, just over two- fi  fths of fi  rms do not 
expect the measures to have any impact on 
their production costs. In addition, almost 
one in ten fi  rms expect certain cost savings.
A rough estimate based on the fi  rms’ re-
sponses about the measures already imple-mented since 2021 suggests average cost 
increases of around 2% in the period from 
2021 onwards.9 According to this estimate, 
the additional measures planned for imple-
mentation by the end of 2024 will lead to 
cost increases of another 2%. Any further 
adjustments to supply chains after 2024 
could thus result in even more cost in-
creases.
7 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2023f).
8 For example, costs can arise through the construc-
tion or rental of warehousing premises and warehouse 
staff. In addition, the establishment of new supply re-
lationships can involve higher expenses for searching 
and coordination. Although shorter delivery routes can 
reduce transport costs, this may also mean moving 
away from the most cost- effi   cient suppliers. On the 
other hand, diversifi  ed supply relationships can also re-
duce procurement costs by alleviating the effects of 
supply chain disruptions, which can lead to short- term 
cost increases or production losses. Diversifi  cation can 
also increase competition among suppliers, which can 
likewise have a cost- cutting impact in the long term; 
see Schiersch et al. (2023).
9 If fi  rm size is taken into account in the calculation by 
weighting by turnover, the cost increases work out 
somewhat smaller at 1.5%.Impact of supply chain changes on

previous years, long- term receivables were also 
built up again in 2022, though they did not yet 
reach pre- pandemic levels. There was growth 
in both long- term receivables from affiliated 
companies and other loans and long- term 
financial assets. In line with the high sales 
growth, there was another significant rise in 
trade receivables. Short- term receivables from 
affiliated companies also recorded a consider -
able increase. The sizeable growth in other re -
ceivables and other assets was mostly driven by 
developments at enterprises in the energy and 
manufacture of transport equipment sectors. 
Securities also rose sharply. Unlike in the two 
previous years, efforts to conserve liquidity 
seemed to play a fairly minor role. For example, 
the increase in the cash item slowed, and more 
long- term securities were also purchased.
As in the previous year, the strong build- up of 
inventories was the main factor driving the in -
crease in non- financial assets in 2022. In 2020, 
they had been scaled back in a bid to conserve liquidity, partly in response to the crisis. Stock -
piling was again broadly spread across sectors. 
Besides the ongoing economic recovery and 
price effects, efforts to make value chains more 
resilient may have been a factor here in some 
cases (see the box on pp. 64 ff.). Tangible fixed 
assets rose sharply, having already grown per -
ceptibly again in the previous year. By contrast, 
intangible fixed assets, which include digital 
goods such as software, databases or patents, 
barely increased.13 The sharp rise in intangible 
fixed assets in the manufacture of transport 
equipment sector was offset by a decline in the 
chemicals and pharmaceutical industry.
The equity ratio of non- financial enterprises de -
clined slightly on average across all sectors in 
2022, but remained at a high level. That ratio 
Stockpiling

but still at a

of fi  rms anticipate a rise in production costs. 
Moreover, smaller fi  rms tend to expect cost 
increases more often than larger fi  rms. The 
regional focus of supply chains also has an 
impact on expected changes in production 
costs. Firms with a regional focus on China 
are more likely to assume that the restruc-
turing of supply chains will lead to cost in-
creases and that these will be comparatively 
high. Overall, the survey results suggest 
that, in a changing international environ-
ment, fi  rms are placing greater emphasis on 
resilience – albeit at some additional cost – 
when weighing up between the effi   ciency 
and resilience of supply chains.10
10 One factor in this changing environment could be 
that supply chain disruptions are more systemic than in 
the past, as they have recently affected several coun-
tries and products simultaneously and had a longer- 
lasting effect; see Baldwin et al. (2023).
13 According to the Commercial Code, intangible fixed 
assets include, amongst other things, internally generated 
industrial rights and similar rights and assets, purchased 
concessions, industrial and similar rights and assets, and li -
cences in such rights.Deutsche Bundesbank

Profi  tability and fi  nancial position of German listed groups 
in 2022 and an outlook for 2023
German non- fi  nancial listed groups re-
corded a decline in their profi  t margin in 
2022.1 Price developments meant that rev-
enue growth signifi  cantly outpaced the rise 
in profi  ts. Equity increased markedly, includ-
ing as a proportion of total assets. Estimates 
for 2023 point to a slight fall in revenues 
and a further decline in the profi  t margin.
Revenues recorded another strong rise of 
21% in 2022.2 Driving factors here were 
price effects and the weaker euro, which in-
creased group revenues generated in for-
eign currencies and converted into euro. 
Overall, these two effects considerably 
overcompensated for the declining sales 
volumes reported by a number of groups. 
As prices also increased on the operating 
cost side, revenue growth only partially fed 
through into groups’ earnings. Operating 
income before depreciation and amortisa-
tion (EBITDA) and operating income (EBIT) 
increased by 8% and 4%, respectively. As a 
consequence, the profi  t margin declined 
from its near- record level of 8.1% in 2021 to 
7.0%. However, this fi  gure remains above 
the long- term average since 2007.3 At the 
sector level, a decline was evident in the 
profi  t margin of the production sector, namely from 7.5% to 6.0%.4 A signifi  cant 
portion of this decline was attributable to 
the losses of energy companies. These def-
icits were the result of the additional cost of 
procuring energy to make up for the cessa-
tion of Russian energy supplies, along with 
valuation effects in connection with trans-
actions to hedge against price risks. In the 
services sector, the profi  t margin increased 
from 10.5% to 11.3%, buoyed by the recov-
ery of the aviation industry and high freight 
rates in the logistics sector.

non- fi  nancial groups admitted for trading on the Prime 
Standard segment of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (ex-

make a meaningful contribution to value creation in 
Germany. Information on the profi  tability and fi  nancial

Groups’ assets grew by 4% in 2022, with 
the build- up of inventories in the produc-
tion sector contributing almost 40% of this 
increase. On the one hand, the general rise 
in prices caused the value of inventories to 
go up. On the other, there was also a vol-
ume effect at work. This was the result of 
higher raw material and intermediate prod-
uct inventories as well as inventory in-
creases in fi  nished products and goods ear-
marked for delivery. Groups’ cash and cash 
equivalents declined by 7%. However, the 
2022 fi  gure for this item was still signifi  -
cantly higher than the levels recorded in the 
years prior to the onset of the coronavirus 
pandemic in 2020. Intangible and tangible 
fi  xed assets, which each accounted for 
more than one- fi  fth of groups’ assets, grew 
by 5% and 4%, respectively.
On the fi  nancing side, short- term and long- 
term liabilities in 2022 were almost un-
changed on the year. At the same time, 
trade payables rose by 15%, with three- 
quarters of all groups recording an increase 
in this balance sheet item. This expansion 
was more or less offset by a decline in 
short- term fi  nancial debt. In the long- term 
sphere, energy companies reported marked 
rises in derivative liabilities. These were the 
result of developments in transactions to hedge against commodity price risks. A sig-
nifi  cant fall in groups’ pension obligations 
overall due to the rising reference interest 
rate had a mitigating effect. The resulting 
liability shift together with the high level of 
retained earnings largely explains the 14% 
rise in equity capital. The equity ratio in-
creased strongly, climbing by 2.8 percent-
age points to 33%. Both equity capital and 
the equity ratio rose signifi  cantly more in 
the production sector than among service 
providers. Notable factors here included 
special effects from transactions involving 
subsidiaries in the automotive industry and 
relating to the fair value of derivatives of 
energy companies.
According to estimates based on the fi  nan-
cial statements of the largest groups in the 
reporting population for the fi  rst three 
quarters of 2023, revenues recorded a slight 
year- on- year decline and pre- tax profi  ts a 
marked decline. This would suggest that a 
further fall in the profi  t margin is likely for 
2023.5 Viewed at the sector level, the pic-
ture that emerges is mixed. In the produc-
tion sector, the automotive industry re-
corded higher delivery volumes and rev-
enues thanks to the growing global market, 
but, due to higher costs (amongst other 
things), this has not fed through into rising 
pre- tax profi  ts.6 Revenue increases here 
were offset by revenue declines in both the 
chemicals sector and amongst energy com-
panies. The chemicals sector reported de-
clines in both demand and prices in a chal-
lenging economic environment. The fall in 
energy prices – from the very high values 
recorded in 2022 – and attempts to save 
energy by end users had the effect of redu-
cing the revenues of energy companies. In 
summary, the revenues of the production

dustry in 2022 was boosted by a one- off effect relat-
ing to the consolidation of subsidiaries.Equity of German non-financial groups

fell most sharply in the manufacture of trans -
port equipment, energy supply and mechanical 
engineering sectors. In most sectors, there was 
an increase in the volume of equity, but this 
was, overall, outpaced by the growth in liabil -
ities and provisions. Equity declined noticeably 
only in the manufacture of transport equip -
ment sector, while it largely stagnated in the 
information and communication sector.
As in the previous year, growth in liabilities and 
provisions was very strong in 2022. On bal -
ance, there was a further shift from long- term 
to short- term liabilities, as in 2022. In 2020, 
liquidity considerations related to the pandemic 
had caused a short- term shift in the ratio of 
long- term to short- term liabilities in favour of 
long- term liabilities. The uptick in business ac -
tivity and price effects caused trade payables 
and advance payments received on account of 
orders to rise sharply. Short-  term liabilities to 
affiliated companies also grew significantly. Un -
like in the previous two years, short- term liabil -ities to banks also increased considerably. By 
contrast, long- term liabilities to banks stag -
nated. As in the previous year, provisions in -
creased sharply in 2022. This was largely due to 
higher provisions for pensions and to other 
provisions set aside in line with positive busi -
ness developments. Provisions for tax also in -
creased sharply, as in the previous two years.
Trends for 2023
In view of the bout of weakness the German 
economy is experiencing, it is likely that non-  
financial enterprises did not expand their busi -
ness activities or, in some cases, reduced them 
in 2023. Although energy markets calmed 
down somewhat, energy prices remained at 
elevated levels. In addition to the increased en -
ergy cost burden, industry is also likely to have 
suffered as a result of weak foreign demand. 
Real exports of goods fell, for example. Mean -

both revenues and pre- tax profi  ts could de-
cline noticeably. The logistics sector, which 
was a driver of the strong rises of previous 
years, experienced weaker demand and a 
considerable decline in freight rates.
The profi  tability of groups as an indicator of 
the picture for individual enterprises should 
be viewed with a degree of caution, as the 
former is essentially subject to greater fl  uc-
tuations. Unlike the single- entity fi  nancial 
statements, which primarily paint a picture 
of business in Germany, consolidated fi  nan-
cial statements refl  ect above all the devel-
opment of the global economy and the do-
mestic economic parameters of the coun-
tries in which the respective subsidiaries are 
located.77 Furthermore, the metrics derived from the fi  nancial 
statements are materially shaped by differences be-
tween the accounting standards applied (German 
GAAP for corporate fi  nancial statement statistics 
(single- entity), IFRS for consolidated fi  nancial state-
ment statistics).Annual result before taxes on income

continued to ease according to ifo Institute and 
S&P Global surveys. The impact of the reversal 
of monetary policy interest rates is likely to be 
felt more strongly in 2023. The increased finan -
cing costs brought about by this could dampen 
private investment and thereby also weigh on 
domestic demand for industrial goods and, in 
particular, construction work. Furthermore, 
order backlogs decreased further, absorbing 
less and less of the decline in demand in indus -
try and the construction sector. Overall, this 
puts a strain on output in these two sectors of 
the economy. In addition, real government 
consumption declined as pandemic- related 
spending came to an end, which was only par -tially replaced by new measures to address the 
energy crisis and high inflation. What is more, 
consumers held back on additional spending 
despite strong wage growth, declining inflation 
rates and stable employment. This is likely to 
hurt consumer- related service providers, in par -
ticular, although the period of economic weak -
ness could well also dampen business activities 
at business- related service providers. Overall, 
enterprises’ profit margins could come under 
stronger pressure in the current year than in 
2022 given high energy prices, increased wages 
and financing costs and gloomier sales pro -
spects.

Tackling the challenges of crypto-assets – 
the state of play with regulation
Since the first Bitcoin block was mined in 2009, thousands of different crypto- assets have been 
created. This cryptosystem has increasingly attracted public attention in recent years. A series of 
scandals, spectacular bankruptcies and crises have exposed the system as a source of potential 
risk. Despite the general interest in the cryptosystem, it is a small, largely self- contained niche 
when compared with the traditional financial system, which means that – at least for the time 
being – it is fairly unlikely that crises in the cryptosystem could pose a threat to financial stability.
In terms of preventive regulation, however, competent authorities worldwide are faced with the 
question of how to deal with crypto- assets with a view to limiting potential future risks to finan -
cial stability. Regulatory approaches are generally guided by the principle of “same activity, same 
risk, same rules” – in other words, focusing on the economic function of an activity, irrespective 
of the technological means used. At the same time, regulation should be formulated in such a 
way that it does not hinder innovation – and the technology underlying the cryptosystem cer -
tainly presents an opportunity to make the financial system more efficient. In addition, regulation 
should take account of the fact that crypto- assets can vary in their design and function.
With regard to the cryptosystem, the principle of “regulate and contain” has now become estab -
lished: first, the cryptosystem itself should be regulated, and second, potential contagion risks 
between the cryptosystem and the traditional financial system should be contained.
In terms of regulating the cryptosystem, the European Union (EU) has taken a major step forward 
and adopted a comprehensive rulebook, the Markets in Crypto-  Assets Regulation (MiCAR). MiCAR 
directly addresses cryptosystem participants, including issuers of crypto- assets and providers of 
crypto- asset services. In future, these participants will be required to comply with a number of 
rules designed to help protect investors and keep potential risks in check.
In a move to contain contagion risks, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) has 
developed an internationally harmonised standard for banks’ exposures to the cryptosystem. 
Banks are expected to comply with this standard when they take on exposures to crypto- assets. 
For example, the standard defines capital requirements geared towards the risk posed by differ -
ent types of crypto- assets. Overall, the standard is designed to ensure that banks are protected 
as well as possible against risks from the cryptosystem even if they have taken on direct expos -
ures.
The aforementioned regulatory initiatives have established initial guard rails. But the cryptosystem 
is rapidly evolving, meaning that what is a robust regulatory framework today might already be 
showing cracks tomorrow. With that in mind, both MiCAR and the Basel standard are already 
being examined to determine the extent to which provisions need to be adjusted to keep up with 
new developments. Overall, crypto- assets are thus likely to remain firm fixtures on the agendas of 
international, European and national regulatory bodies for years to come.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
When the concept of Bitcoin was made public 
in a November 2008 paper authored by the 
pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, this marked 
a critical juncture on the path to a new, digital 
form of money.1 Ever since the 1980s, if not 
before, computer specialists and idealists had 
been attempting to bring together the internet, 
cryptography and money. Their aim was to de -
velop digital money that everyone could use 
anytime and anywhere, free from government 
control.
Today, there are thousands of crypto- assets be -
sides Bitcoin, and it is no longer just specialists 
who engage with crypto- assets. A very large 
number of participants with different back -
grounds now operate in the various sectors of 
the cryptosystem: people living in regions lack -
ing a sufficient traditional financial infrastruc -
ture, small investors who want to see how the 
cryptosystem works, speculators hoping to 
make a quick profit and criminals relying on the 
supposed anonymity of the cryptosystem to 
launder money or engage in other illegal activ -
ities. Traditional financial institutions are also 
operating in the cryptosystem, investigating, 
for example, what kind of efficiency gains the 
underlying distributed ledger technology (DLT)2 
might deliver.3
Given how rapidly the cryptosystem is evolving, 
possible risks and regulatory implications must 
be considered. The cryptosystem itself is a po -
tential source of various risks that can also af -
fect the traditional financial system. For ex -
ample, it is in many respects highly concen -
trated: the two largest crypto- assets, Bitcoin 
and Ether, account for just under 70% of mar -
ket capitalisation.4 Trading in crypto- assets is 
also concentrated on a small number of plat -
forms. At the same time, liquidity in the system 
depends on a small number of stablecoins – 
crypto-  assets that are backed by traditional 
assets.5 In the event of a run on a stablecoin, 
the reserves of traditional assets backing it 
could open up a channel of contagion between the cryptosystem and the traditional financial 
system. There is also a danger of stablecoins 
increasing the risk of currency substitution in 
regions of the world where there is a lack of 
established financial infrastructure or confi -
dence in monetary stability.6 In addition, the 
cryptosystem often involves high leverage, with 
loans mostly secured by uncovered and thus 
volatile crypto- assets. On top of this, market 
structures are complex and opaque.
The risks inherent in the cryptosystem may well 
take on a systemic dimension, which raises the 
question of the extent to which the traditional 
financial system could also be affected. The 
size of the cryptosystem is one factor that plays 
a role in the risk it poses to the traditional 
financial system. When compared with the 
traditional financial system, the cryptosystem is 
actually little more than a niche. However, the 
past has shown that even small market seg -
ments can lead to major crises. What is more 
important than relative size is the fact that the 
cryptosystem and the traditional financial sys -
tem have so far barely interacted with each 
other. Most of the channels through which cri -
ses in the cryptosystem could affect the trad -
itional financial system are therefore of little 
relevance today. This is a snapshot, however – 
the risks emanating from the cryptosystem will 
depend on how it evolves over time.
When considering a preventive approach, regu -
lators are therefore faced with the question of 
how they should treat the cryptosystem. A 
fairly simple method would be to prohibit all 
activities related to crypto- assets, at least in 
one’s own jurisdiction. Alternatively, the cryp -Idea behind

tosystem could be left to itself, with the only 
measures taken being those to ensure that the 
traditional financial system remains unaffected 
by potential crises. The third and final option 
would be to regulate the cryptosystem to en -
sure its stability, too, and to protect investors 
and consumers.
A ban on all activities related to crypto- assets 
would constitute a significant intervention by 
the government. Moreover, a ban could mean 
that it takes longer for beneficial innovations to 
catch on, if they catch on at all.
To protect the traditional financial system from 
adverse developments in the cryptosystem, a 
containment strategy could also be pursued. 
Regulators would focus on limiting the links be -
tween the cryptosystem and the traditional 
financial system. Crises in the cryptosystem 
would therefore not pose a direct threat to 
general financial stability.
However, there are also grounds for consider -
ing regulation of the cryptosystem itself. First, 
an unregulated cryptosystem would take zero 
account of important concerns, including con -
sumer protection and money laundering pre -
vention. Second, the possibility of the crypto -
system expanding beyond its niche over time 
and becoming a relevant part of the financial 
system cannot be ruled out. And third, risks 
traditionally associated with financial services 
do not usually disappear simply because the 
services are carried out by other technological 
means. For this reason, “same activity, same 
risk, same rules” is a guiding principle for es -
tablishing a regulatory framework – where an 
activity has an economic function that has an 
equivalent in the traditional financial system 
and is thus exposed to the same risk, it should 
be subject to the same regulation.7 Moving ac -
tivities to the cryptosystem must not be a way 
of circumventing regulation.
Regulating the cryptosystem itself is therefore a 
key component in dealing with crypto- assets. 
Against this background, national, European and international bodies have decided to es -
tablish minimum standards for the regulation 
of cryptosystems. In the EU and Germany, 
regulatory measures aim to provide scope for 
innovation through a clear framework whilst at 
the same time minimising risks to the financial 
system and ensuring consumer protection.
Looking at established banks, the BCBS8 has 
decided to treat crypto- assets within the trad -
itional regulatory framework for the banking 
system in order to contain contagion risks. 
Overall, regulators are thus following the “regu -
late and contain” approach mentioned previ -
ously.
The following sections provide an overview of 
the main initiatives to regulate the cryptosys -
tem itself and to regulate banks’ exposure to 
crypto- assets.

structures based on DLT12 and a digital finance 
strategy. MiCAR was published on 9 June 2023 
and entered into force on 29 June 2023.
The provisions set out in MiCAR, which are ex -
plained in more detail below, have varying 
dates of application (see the chart above).
The main objective of MiCAR is to create a har -
monised European legal framework for all 
crypto- assets that are not already covered by 
other existing EU regulations.13 MiCAR is in -
tended to support innovation and make it pos -
sible to harness the potential of crypto- assets 
whilst ensuring that financial stability, the 
smooth operation of payment systems and 
monetary policy transmission and investor pro -
tection are maintained.
In this context, MiCAR makes an explicit dis -
tinction between (i) various activities relating to 
the issuance and offers of crypto- assets and (ii) 
crypto- asset services.
The main points covered by Article 1 of MiCAR 
are:
– requirements for issuers of asset- referenced 
tokens and e- money tokens14 and crypto-  
asset service providers as well as supervisory 
requirements for, amongst other things, the management and organisation of these par -
ticipants;
– transparency and disclosure requirements 
for offers to the public and admissions of 
crypto- assets to trading;
– requirements for protecting the holders of 
crypto- assets and the clients of undertakings 
offering crypto- asset services;
– requirements for the disclosure of inside in -
formation; measures to prevent insider deal -
ing, unlawful disclosure of inside informa -
tion and market manipulation related to 
crypto- assets.

European Securities and Markets Authority

MiCAR. These are intended to further specify 
and make applicable the provisions in MiCAR 
that apply to issuers of e- money tokens and 
asset- referenced tokens as well as to crypto-  
asset service providers.
Definitions and addressees of 
MiCAR
Article 3(1) number 5 of MiCAR introduces a 
definition of the term crypto- assets in Europe. 
This definition is an umbrella term that is fur -
ther broken down into (i) asset- referenced 
tokens (ARTs), (ii) e- money tokens (EMTs), (iii) 
utility tokens and (iv) other crypto- assets that 
do not fall into any of the other categories (see 
the chart on p. 78).
MiCAR does not apply to crypto- assets that are 
covered by other EU regulations. MiCAR there -
fore does not apply, inter alia, to crypto- assets 
belonging to one or more of the following cat -
egories: (i) financial instruments within the 
meaning of the Markets in Financial Instru -
ments Directive II (MiFID II)15 (e.g. tokenised 
securities), (ii) e- money16 within the meaning of 
the Electronic Money Directive II (EMD II),17 
with the exception of EMTs within the meaning 
of MiCAR, (iii) deposits within the meaning of 
the Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive, and 
(iv) structured deposits within the meaning of 
MiFID II.18
The addressees of MiCAR are natural and legal 
persons and certain other undertakings19 that 
are engaged in the issuance, offer to the pub -
lic20 and admission to trading of crypto- assets 
or that provide services related to crypto- assets 
in the EU (Article 2(1) of MiCAR). MiCAR distin -
guishes between issuers and offerors (see the 
chart on p. 79).
MiCAR sets forth a catalogue21 of ten different 
crypto- asset services that closely mirrors the 
catalogue of MiFID activities. In particular, 
MiCAR  lists: (i) providing custody and adminis -
tration of crypto- assets on behalf of clients; (ii) the operation of a trading platform for crypto- 
assets; (iii) the exchange of crypto- assets for 
funds; (iv) the exchange of crypto- assets for 
other crypto- assets; (v) the execution of orders 
for crypto- assets on behalf of clients; (vi) the 
placing of crypto- assets; (vii) the reception and 
transmission of orders for crypto- assets on be -
half of clients; (viii) providing advice on crypto- 
assets; (ix) providing portfolio management on 
crypto- assets; and (x) providing transfer ser -
vices for crypto- assets on behalf of clients.
Crypto- asset services that are provided in a fully 
decentralised manner without any intermediary 
do not fall within the scope of the Regulation. 
This applies to crypto- assets without a deter -
minable issuer, including Bitcoin, for example. 
However, it should be noted that crypto- asset 
service providers offering services relating to 
crypto- assets without a determinable issuer do 
fall within the scope of MiCAR. This means, for 
example, that a crypto-  asset service provider 
that renders services related to or using Bitcoin 
is covered by the scope of MiCAR.Introduction of

Rules for offerors of 
crypto-assets
Requirements for issuers of ARTs22
Authorisation requirements as well as ongoing 
obligations are envisaged for issuers of ARTs. 
An offer of ARTs to the public or the applica -
tion for their admission to trading on a trading 
platform of crypto- assets generally requires au -
thorisation granted by the competent author -
ity.23 Authorisation is conditional on the issuer 
of the ARTs being a legal person or another 
undertaking established in the EU, for instance. 
The issuer must draw up and publish a crypto- 
asset white paper.24,25 This white paper must 
also be submitted and approved as part of the 
application for authorisation.
Authorisation is not required if the outstanding 
value of the ART does not exceed €5 million or 
the equivalent value in another currency over a 
period of 12 months, or if the offer to the pub -lic of the ART is addressed solely to qualified 
investors where the ART can only be held by 
such investors.26 However, issuers are still re -
quired to draw up a crypto- asset white paper 
and submit it to the competent authority for 
approval.
Issuers of ARTs must comply with a number of 
requirements. Alongside various obligations 
pertaining to communication, publication, no -
tifications, complaints- handling procedures, 
disclosure, governance and business organisa -
tion, the issuer must hold sufficient own 
funds,27 draw up a recovery plan and a re -
demption plan28 and maintain a reserve29 that Comprehensive

covers the risks associated with the assets ref -
erenced by the ARTs. How the reserve assets 
must be held in custody and invested is speci -
fied for the reserve.
Credit institutions authorised in the EU30 do not 
need to be explicitly authorised to offer ARTs to 
the public or to apply for admission to trading. 
However, they must likewise draw up a crypto- 
asset white paper and submit it to the compe -
tent authority for approval. In addition, they 
must comply with the other requirements.31
Requirements for issuers of EMTs
In the EU, only credit or e- money institutions 
that have already been authorised may offer 
EMTs to the public or apply for admission to 
trading for these tokens.32 To do so, they must 
submit a crypto- asset white paper to the com -
petent authority and publish it.33
Since e- money tokens are very closely related 
to e- money – as the name suggests – EMTs are 
explicitly considered to be e- money. Therefore, 
MiCAR stipulates that EMT issuers must largely 
comply with the provisions set out in the EMD 
II – with only a few specific adjustments due to 
MiCAR. Central requirements include EMT 
holders’ right to redeem their tokens at par value34 at any time as well as compliance with 
security requirements.
If the EBA classifies ARTs or EMTs as significant 
on the basis of several criteria (size, scope, in -
terconnectedness, etc.), issuers must comply 
with additional requirements. These include, 
for example, higher own funds requirements 
and additional reserve management require -
ments.35
Provisions for other crypto- assets
Although an offer to the public or an admission 
to trading of crypto- assets other than ARTs or 
EMTs do not require authorisation, MiCAR sets 
out some necessary requirements that must be 
adhered to.36 An offer to the public or an appli -
cation for admission to trading in the EU may 
only be made by legal persons. They must draw 
up and publish a crypto- asset white paper and 
submit it to the competent authority. Require -Only already

requirement is not the issue itself but rather the offer to the public or the application for admission to trading.

must be granted rights of withdrawal.
Exceptions to the obligations outlined above 
are provided, for example, if other crypto-  
assets are offered free of charge as ARTs or 
EMTs or if these crypto- assets involve mining 
rewards.37
Rules for crypto- asset service 
providers
As a general rule, crypto- asset services pursu -
ant to MiCAR may only be provided by pro -
viders that are established in the EU and au -
thorised as crypto- asset service providers by the 
competent authority.38 However, certain under -
takings, such as credit institutions, investment 
firms and e- money institutions, are allowed to 
provide all or specific crypto-  asset services 
without separate authorisation.39 They simply 
have to inform the competent authority before 
providing the planned activity using the infor -
mation specified in MiCAR. Pursuant to MiCAR, 
crypto- asset service providers also have to 
comply with certain provisions, including hold -
ing own funds, compliance with governance 
requirements and safeguarding crypto- assets 
and clients’ funds.40 Specific obligations also 
apply depending on the service. For instance, a 
crypto- asset service provider that provides cus -
tody must enter into an agreement with clients 
with predetermined minimum content.41 
Where a trading platform for crypto- assets is 
operated, own- account trading is prohibited.
With the exception of the own funds require -
ments, all of the above- mentioned require -
ments also apply to undertakings that do not 
require a separate authorisation for this service. 
By contrast, the own funds requirements for 
these undertakings are governed by the applic -
able sectoral supervisory legislation.
Crypto- asset service providers may provide 
these services throughout the EU by means of cross-  border services or by establishing a 
branch. They must notify the competent au -
thority of this intention (see the chart on p. 81).
Competent authorities in 
Germany 
In Germany, the Federal Financial Supervisory 
Authority (BaFin) in cooperation with the 
Bundesbank supervise the issuers of ARTs and 
EMTs and also crypto- asset service providers. 
However, MiCAR stipulates that supervision is 
to be fully transferred to the EBA in the case of 
significant ARTs42 and partially transferred in 
the case of significant EMTs43. In the case of 
credit institutions and e- money institutions, the 
EBA will exercise these supervisory powers in 
close cooperation with the other competent 
authorities.
MiCAR and German law
Crypto- assets were already subject to German 
law even before MiCAR. Owing to the law 
transposing the amending directive to the 
Fourth EU Anti- Money Laundering Directive 
(Federal Law Gazette I, 2019, p. 2602), German 
legislators established a very broad definition of 
crypto- assets in the Banking Act (Kreditwesen -Rules for crypto-

37 See Article 4(3)(b) of MiCAR. In the case of crypto-  
assets such as Bitcoin, mining describes the procedure used 
to process, secure and synchronise transactions. Miners 
provide the system with computing power for this purpose. 
High power consumption means that the computing 
power is very costly. Miners are remunerated with mining 
rewards (units of the crypto- asset and proportionate trans -

crypto- custody business was also added to the 
Banking Act as a new financial service and 
crypto- assets as a new financial instrument. 
These existing national rules need to be ad -
justed on account of the provisions under 
MiCAR .

European definition. The category “crypto-  
custody business” will be maintained in the 
Banking Act under the new name of  “qualified 
crypto- custody business” (qualifiziertes Krypto -
verwahrgeschäft).  This serves to maintain the 
authorisation  requirement for the custody of 
crypto- assets that do not fall within the scope 
of MiCAR. Qualified crypto- custody business 
comprises the custody of cryptographic finan -
cial instruments and the safeguarding of 
cryptographic keys, which are, for example, 
used to enable access to crypto- securities.
The Basel standard for 
the prudential treatment 
of banks’ crypto- asset 
exposures 
While MiCAR is aimed directly at cryptosystem 
participants, the BCBS focuses on banks’ ex -
posures to the cryptosystem.
In December 2022, the BCBS added an add -
itional standard (SCO60)46 to the Basel frame -
work. This new standard sets out the pruden -
tial treatment of banks’ crypto- asset exposures 
and is designed to shield the traditional finan -
cial system from risks arising from the crypto -
system. Overall, the standard only defines min -
imum requirements. This means that individual 
jurisdictions still have the option of generally 
prohibiting crypto- assets, restricting banks’ ex -
posure to this segment or regulating such ex -
posure more strictly than the standard requires.
Definitions in the Basel 
 standard
With regard to the definition of crypto- assets, 
the Basel standard takes a broad approach, 
similarly to MiCAR, and generally includes pri -
vate digital assets that are based on cryptog -
raphy and DLT or similar technologies.47
The standard distinguishes between two 
groups of crypto- assets based on a set of clas -sification conditions (see the upper table on 
p. 86) and sets out different requirements for 
these groups, especially with regard to capital 
requirements. The chart on p.  85 provides a 
schematic representation of the structure of 
the standard; its elements are explained in de -
tail on the following pages.48
Both tokenised traditional assets (Group 1a), 
such as bonds issued with DLT, and crypto-  
assets with an effective stabilisation mechan -
ism (stablecoins) (Group 1b) may qualify for 
Group 1. If crypto- assets do not meet the clas -
sification conditions specified in the standard 
(see the upper table on p. 86), they must be 
classified in Group 2. Unbacked crypto- assets 
must always be assigned to Group 2; the most 
prominent example here being Bitcoin.
The classification conditions are designed to 
ensure that the risk profile of crypto- assets in 
Group 1 is comparable to that of traditional 
assets49,50 Based on the principle of “same ac -
tivity, same risk, same rules”, the standard es -
sentially applies the existing Basel framework 
to these crypto- assets as far as capital require -
ments are concerned. A tokenised corporate 
bond in the banking book, for example, could 
generally receive the same risk weight as a con -
ventional corporate bond in the banking book. 
By contrast, the standard assumes higher or 
novel risks for Group 2 crypto- assets and pro -
vides for a conservative regime to contain these 
risks for banks.New BCBS

47 The definitions are worded as follows: “Cryptoassets are 
defined as private digital assets that depend on cryptog -
raphy and distributed ledger technologies (DLT) or similar 
technologies. Digital assets are a digital representation of 
value, which can be used for payment or investment pur -
poses or to access a good or service.”
48 See Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2022a) .
49 The standard defines traditional assets as those assets 
that are covered by the Basel framework and which do not 
fall under the crypto- asset definition introduced in the 
standard.

of the standard, see also the preceding consultations: Basel

The work of the Financial Stability Board on crypto- assets
As an international body coordinating the 
supervision and regulation of international 
fi  nancial markets, the Financial Stability 
Board (FSB) has also been increasingly fo-
cussing on the risks posed by crypto- assets 
in recent years. Its aim in this regard has 
been to promote a comprehensive and 
internationally standardised regulatory ap-
proach.
To this end, the FSB published recommen-
dations on the regulation, supervision and 
oversight of “global stablecoin” (GSC) ar-
rangements in October 2020.1 GSCs are sta-
blecoins2 that could be potentially used on 
a large scale across multiple jurisdictions as 
a means of making payments and/ or as a 
store of value. These properties mean that 
GSCs could pose particular risks to fi  nancial 
stability.
The FSB subsequently published a compre-
hensive global regulatory framework for 
crypto- asset activities in July 2023. The 
framework consists of two sets of recom-
mendations that defi  ne minimum inter-
national standards for the regulation, super-
vision and oversight of crypto- assets. In 
view of the greater risks posed by GSCs, the 
FSB has decided to maintain separate rec-
ommendations for these crypto- assets. At 
the same time, however, the FSB supple-
mented them by a second set of recom-
mendations that is applicable to any crypto- 
asset and crypto market, including stable-
coins and decentralised fi  nance (DeFi).
The FSB’s recommendations focus primarily 
on fi  nancial stability risks and have been in-
tentionally formulated in general and 
principles- oriented terms. They are based 
on the principles of “same activity, same 
risk, same rules” and technological neutral-ity. The principles are fl  exible enough not to 
require a specifi  c regulatory framework for 
their implementation. Therefore, it is up to 
each jurisdiction to decide whether to im-
plement the recommendations by adopting 
a new regulation (as in the case of the Mar-
kets in Crypto- Assets Regulation, MiCAR) or 
by applying or extending an existing one. 
The FSB’s recommendations are also de-
signed to allow international standard- 
setting bodies such as the Basel Committee 
on Banking Supervision enough scope to 
develop granular standards.
The status of implementation of the two 
sets of recommendations in the respective 
jurisdictions is to be reviewed at the end of 
2025.3 In the interim, the FSB and the Inter-
national Monetary Fund will work together 
towards ensuring that the recommenda-
tions are implemented globally in an as har-
monised manner as possible.4
Based on the principles set out in the FSB’s 
recommendations, other international 
standard- setting bodies are currently exam-
ining the extent to which their respective 
standards can already be applied to crypto- 
assets and stablecoins, or if further guid-
ance is required.
Of particular note in this context is a report 
published by the Bank for International 
Settlements’ Committee on Payments and 
Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the Inter-
national Organization of Securities Commis-
sions (IOSCO) in July 2022. The report 
1 See Financial Stability Board (2020).

aim to maintain a stable value relative to a specifi  ed 
asset, or a pool or basket of assets.

Individual institutions are required to continu -
ously check whether the crypto- assets they 
hold meet the classification conditions. At the 
same time, institutions are required to inform 
the supervisory authorities of their assessment 
results. Supervisors, in turn, may disagree with 
institutions’ assessments and override classifi -
cation decisions.
Rules for crypto- assets in 
Group 1 of the Basel standard
For Group 1 crypto- assets, the standard speci -
fies how institutions should apply the existing 
provisions of the Basel framework for calculat -
ing credit, market and counterparty credit risk 
of these crypto- assets. The same applies to 
credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risks. Follow -
ing the same logic, institutions can, for ex -
ample, also apply internal models to Group 1 
crypto- assets; the overview below illustrates 
these regulations.The possibility of recognising crypto- assets as 
collateral for the purpose of credit risk mitiga -
tion is limited to Group 1a crypto- assets, as the 
crypto- assets in Group 1b require redemption, 
which entails additional counterparty credit 
risk.
The new standard also includes an infrastruc -
ture risk add- on, which is a flexible instrument 
that allows supervisors to respond to potential 
additional risks arising from the underlying 
technology. This add- on is initially set to zero, 
but can be increased by supervisors if corres -
ponding risks arise that are not already ad -
equately taken into account elsewhere.
Rules for crypto- assets in 
Group 2 of the Basel Standard
As these crypto- assets are riskier, the standard 
sets out separate capital requirement rules for 
Group 2. The starting point is a simple, conser -Capital

for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI) 
can be applied to stablecoin arrangements.5 
Following the principle of “same activities, 
same risks, same rules”, the report essen-
tially fi  nds that the PFMI can be applied to 
systemically important stablecoin arrange-
ments. At the same time, the report also 
sets out additional specifi  c recommended 
actions for a number of the Principles in re-
spect of stablecoin arrangements.6
IOSCO also published a consultation report 
in May 2023 proposing recommendations 
addressed to the respective jurisdictions on 
the regulation and supervision of crypto- 
asset service providers.7 It focuses on con-
siderations on the protection of investors 
and their assets and the organisation of 
crypto- asset trading. The fi  nal report is ex-
pected in 2024.5 See Committee on Payments and Market Infrastruc-
ture and International Organization of Securities Com-
missions (2022).

work for the comprehensive management of risk), 8

vative approach, which generally provides for a 
risk weight of 1,250% for these crypto- assets, 
i.e. if the total capital ratio is 8%, these assets 
must, in principle, be backed entirely with cap -
ital. This approach does not distinguish be -
tween crypto- assets in the banking and trading 
books and does not differentiate between 
credit and market risks, including CVA risks.51 
The counterparty credit risk must additionally 
be backed by capital. The standard excludes 
the use of internal models and the recognition 
as collateral for crypto- assets in Group 2 (see 
the lower table on p. 86).
Nevertheless, the standard recognises that, 
even for Group 2 crypto- assets, risks can in 
some cases be reduced through hedging. 
Group 2 is subdivided accordingly: For Group 
2a, the standard defines an adapted version of 
the requirements for market, CVA and counter -
party credit risk, allowing institutions to net risk 
positions to a limited extent. One prerequisite 
for classification as Group 2a is that there is a functioning market for the respective crypto-  
assets that allows the advantages of hedging 
to be realised effectively (see the table on 
p. 87).
In view of the higher risks that Group 2 crypto- 
assets pose, the BCBS has decided to explicitly 
limit an institution’s maximum permissible risk 
exposure to this group of crypto- assets. An in -
stitution’s total exposure to Group 2 crypto-  
assets may not exceed 2% of the institution’s 
tier 1 capital and should generally be below 1% 
of tier 1 capital. If the institution exceeds the 
1% limit, it must treat the excess amount as 
belonging to Group 2b. If the institution ex -
ceeds the 2% limit, the capital requirements of 
Group 2b apply to all Group 2 crypto- assets.Conservative

Further requirements of the 
Basel standard
Irrespective of the individual groups, the new 
standard also sets out how other elements of 
the Basel framework are to be applied to 
crypto- assets. For example, institutions must 
take crypto- assets into account in the leverage 
ratio, the large exposure regime and the calcu -
lation of operational risks. Institutions should 
also take due account of the specific risks of 
crypto- assets in their internal risk management, 
for example technological or legal risks. Super -
visors, in turn, should expand their supervisory review process accordingly. Institutions must 
disclose business activities and risks as well as 
risk management measures.
Liquidity risks associated with crypto- assets (or 
crypto- liabilities) are identified on the basis of 
the existing prudential definitions and classifi -
cations in accordance with the liquidity cover -
age ratio (LCR) and the net stable funding ratio 
(NSFR). Accordingly, Group 1a crypto- assets 
and liabilities are treated in the same way as 
their traditional counterparts. This allows to -
kenised versions of highly liquid assets to be 
included in the LCR liquidity buffer. Other Application of

crypto- assets and related activities are classified 
according to their liquidity characteristics as fol -
lows, irrespective of the group classification de -
scribed above.
– Stablecoins of Group 1b and certain stable -
coins of Group 2 are treated as non- liquid 
securities; such holdings are thus subject to 
a required stable funding (RSF) factor of 
85% in the NSFR.
– The payment flow assumptions for own-  
issued stablecoins in groups 1b and 2 are 
treated like own- issued collateralised secur -
ities.
– Other crypto- assets are subject to the most 
stringent treatment possible in the LCR and 
NSFR, i.e. holdings in or claims on these 
assets are not to be considered as liquid 
assets or inflows in the LCR and are subject 
to an RSF factor of 100% in the NSFR, while 
liabilities in these assets are subject to an 
outflow rate of 100% in the LCR when due 
within 30 days and do not contribute to 
stable funding in the NSFR.Implementation of the Basel 
standard
The members of the BCBS have agreed to im -
plement the new standard in their respective 
jurisdictions by 1 January 2025.52 Correspond -
ing discussions have also commenced in the 
European Union. The review of the Capital Re -
quirements Regulation (CRR) and the Capital 
Requirements Directive (CRD) that is currently 
underway is intended to initially introduce a 
transitional regime for the treatment of crypto- 
assets.
Outlook
The regulatory initiatives presented make an 
important contribution to the regulation of the 
cryptosystem. They help to protect consumers 
and to maintain financial stability and the 
smooth operation of payment systems without 
hindering innovation.
It is now important that the regulation adopted 
to date is implemented consistently and swiftly.

ments necessary for MiCAR and adapting 
supervisory activities to the requirements of the 
regulation.
However, despite the regulatory progress made 
so far, one point is clear: the cryptosystem and 
the technologies on which it is based are rap -
idly evolving. It is therefore to be expected that 
change in this area will remain a constant for 
the time being. And with this change, regula -
tion must also evolve where necessary.
Regulators are aware of this necessity. The 
BCBS is already looking into some follow- up 
questions:53 For example, it is currently review -
ing some aspects of the classification condi -
tions for Group 1b (stablecoins), including the 
appropriate composition of reserve assets for 
these crypto- assets.
And although the EU, with MiCAR, is at the 
forefront of global crypto regulation, it became 
clear already during the negotiations that there 
may still be gaps in MiCAR that should be 
closed. Examples include staking54 and lending, 
which thus far do not fall under MiCAR’s scope 
of application. The same applies to decentral -
ised finance (DeFi). The main challenge in the 
case of DeFi is to define potential addressees 
for regulation and supervision.55 At the same 
time, the collapse of the FTX crypto trading 
platform in November 2022, in particular, 
pointed to a further need for action under Mi -
CAR.56 Even if MiCAR had already been in 
force, the regulation would not have fully 
covered FTX’s business practices. This is mainly 
because MiCAR does not provide the possibility 
of consolidated supervision or of additional 
prudential requirements for the bundling of 
several activities.
For all these reasons, MiCAR requires the Euro -
pean Commission to present a report on the latest developments with respect to crypto-  
assets by 30  December 2024.57 This report 
should include, amongst other things, assess -
ments of the necessity and feasibility of regu -
lating lending and borrowing of crypto- assets 
and of the appropriate regulatory treatment of 
crypto- assets without an issuer. The European 
Commission may, if appropriate, present a con -
crete legislative proposal alongside the report.
From today’s perspective, it is impossible to say 
with any certainty how the cryptosystem will 
evolve going forward. Given the potential risks, 
a preventive regulatory approach is prudent. 
However, it needs to be accompanied by add -
itional measures.58 First, the cryptosystem is still 
fairly opaque; while MiCAR improves the situ -
ation, it would make sense to go further here 
and cover areas of the cryptosystem that do 
not yet fall under MiCAR’s scope of application. 
Second, the cryptosystem is largely detached 
from geographical structures and thus provides 
scope for regulatory arbitrage; a globally har -
monised regulatory approach would be desir -
able.
While the regulatory progress made so far is 
considerable, we have not yet come to the end 
of the road, and there is no telling where the 
end of the road will be. Going forward, the 
topic of crypto- assets will continue to be a key 
focus of regulators around the world.However, the 
regulatory 
journey  will 
continue

Other regulatory initiatives
In addition to the standards and laws de-
scribed above, a number of other regula-
tory initiatives expressly extend the possibil-
ity of using distributed ledger technology 
(DLT) in the fi  nancial sector.1
Pilot regime for DLT- based market 
 infrastructures
One of the three pillars of the European 
Commission’s digital finance package 
adopted in 2020 is the introduction of a 
regulatory sandbox for the use of DLT in 
market infrastructures. The pilot regime 
(Regulation on a pilot regime for market in-
frastructures based on distributed ledger 
technology) has been applicable in the 
European Union since 23  March 2023. It 
creates a simplifi  ed supervisory framework 
for the trading and settlement of tokenised 
securities within the meaning of the Mar-
kets in Financial Instruments Directive II 
( MiFID II).
The Regulation provides for three new types 
of fi  nancial market infrastructures: DLT 
multilateral trading facilities, DLT settlement 
systems, and DLT trading facilities and 
settlement systems used in tandem. As a 
baseline, these infrastructures must comply 
with the provisions of MiFID II, the Markets 
in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR) 
and the Central Securities Depository Regu-
lation (CSDR). However, investment fi  rms, 
market operators and central securities de-
positories can apply to their national super-
visory authorities for exemptions from these 
requirements for a period of six years pro-
vided that the use of DLT justifi  es such ex-
emptions. The supervisory authority may, 
however, impose compensatory measures 
aimed at meeting the objectives of the ori-
ginal requirements.A number of thresholds have been put in 
place to prevent market infrastructures be-
coming too large and thus posing a risk to 
fi  nancial stability. For example, a new fi  nan-
cial instrument may not be included in trad-
ing or settlement if this would result in the 
total market value of all the securities in-
cluded exceeding €6 billion.2 Should the 
market value of all fi  nancial instruments in-
cluded reach €9 billion (e.g. via increases in 
market value), a transition strategy must be 
implemented, i.e. conversion to a trad-
itional infrastructure for which no further 
exemptions apply.3 This transition strategy 
must also be implemented if the exemp-
tions granted no longer apply after the six- 
year period.
It remains to be seen if the pilot regime will 
actually make it easier to get technical in-
novations off the ground in the EU. The ap-
peal of the pilot regime is diminished by the 
fact that the high costs involved in setting 
up a fi  nancial market infrastructure are 
paired with an operating period of just six 
years.4 Potential users of the infrastructure 
also need to consider if they wish to incur 
the one- off connection and utilisation costs 
given this limited operating period.
One of the strengths of the regime is its 
highly customisable supervisory framework 
for infrastructure operators, thanks to the

covered by the German Ordinance on Enhanced Due 
Diligence Obligations for the Transfer of Crypto- Assets

exemptions that can be applied for in each 
case. However, this customised approach 
also increases complexity for supervisors, 
operators and users of fi  nancial market in-
frastructures. The European Securities and 
Markets Authority is endeavouring to coun-
teract this by publishing the authorisations 
and exemptions that have been granted on 
its website.5

setz über elektronische Wertpapiere, eWpG) 
makes it possible to issue bearer debt secur-
ities, Pfandbriefe and shares in special funds 
in a purely electronic format whereby the 
issuer records them in an electronic secur-
ities register. The eWpG does not cover 
registered securities and order bonds, how-
ever.
Before the eWpG came into force, with the 
exception of government bonds, fi  nancial 
instruments classifi  ed as securities under 
civil law had to be securitised in a physical 
certifi  cate. The transfer of these securities is 
carried out under the principles of property 
law alongside the application of civil law 
provisions on the protection of good faith. 
To facilitate comparable marketability and 
legally compliant acquisition for electronic 
securities, too, these securities are deemed 
to be “things” (res) in a legal sense via a 
legal fi  ction. This means the transfer of 
electronic securities is also governed by the 
principles of property law.
The eWpG distinguishes between two types 
of electronic securities registers, namely 
central securities registers and crypto- 
securities registers.7 A crypto- securities 
register must be maintained on a tamper- 
proof system that records data in chrono-
logical order and safeguards them against 
unauthorised deletion and retroactive modi-fi  cation.8 The requirements governing how 
the system should be designed have been 
formulated in a technology- neutral manner; 
the aim is not to specify DLT or any particu-
lar form of this technology. Furthermore, 
the eWpG does not state that a DLT- based 
system for recording data complies with 
legal requirements at all times.9 Since 
10 June 2021, maintaining crypto- securities 
registers has been deemed a fi  nancial ser-
vice requiring a licence within the meaning 
of Section 1(1a) number 8 of the German 
Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz).

Discrepancies may arise from rounding.  * The banking system's liquidity position is
defined as the current account holdings in euro of euro area credit institutions with the
Eurosystem. Amounts are derived from the consolidated financial statement of the
Eurosystem and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  1 Figures are daily averages
for the reserve maintenance period ending in the month indicated. Following the
changeover in the frequency of Governing Council monetary policy meetings to a
six-week cycle, a reserve maintenance period no longer ends in every month. No figuresare available in such cases.  2 Source: ECB.  3 Includes liquidity provided under the
Eurosystem's asset purchase programmes.  4 From August 2009 includes liquidity
absorbed as a result of the Eurosystem's foreign exchange swap operations.  5 From
2002 euro banknotes and other banknotes which have been issued by the national cen-
tral banks of the Eurosystem and which are still in circulation. In accordance with the
accounting procedure chosen by the Eurosystem for the issue of euro banknotes, a
share of 8% of the total value of the euro banknotes in circulation is

circulation is allocated, likewise on a monthly basis, to the NCBs, with each NCB
showing in its balance sheet the share of the euro banknotes issued corresponding to
its paid-up share in the ECB's capital. The difference between the value of the euro
banknotes allocated to an NCB and the value of the euro banknotes which that NCB
has put into circulation is likewise shown under “Other factors”. From 2003 eurobanknotes only.  6 Remaining items in the consolidated financial statement of the Euro-

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).

ures based on the quarterly figures of the Federal Statistical Office, core budgets and
off-budget entities which are assigned to the general government sector.  2 The annual
figures do not tally with the sum of the quarterly figures, as the latter are all pro-
visional. The quarterly figures for some insurance sectors are estimated.  3 The develop-
ment of the types of expenditure recorded here is influenced in part by statisticalchangeovers.  4 Including discrepancies in clearing transactions between central, state
and local government.  5 On the revenue side, this contains proceeds booked as dis-
posals of equity interests and as loan repayments. On the expenditure side, this con-
tains the acquisition of equity interests and loans granted.  6 Excluding central govern-
ment liquidity assistance to the Federal Employment Agency.

* The effective exchange rate corresponds to the weighted external value of the curren-
cy concerned. The method of calculating the indicators of the German economy's price
competitiveness is consistent with the procedure to compute the effective exchange
rates of the euro. A decline in the figures implies an increase in competitiveness. The
weights are based on trade in manufactured goods and services. For more detailed in-
formation on methodology and weighting scale, see the website of the Deutsche
Bundesbank (https://www.bundesbank.de/content/796162).  1 The calculations are
based on the weighted averages of the changes in the bilateral exchange rates of the
euro vis-à-vis the currencies of the following 18 countries: Australia, Bulgaria, Canada,
China, Czechia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan, Norway, Poland, Romania,
Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United
States. Where current price and wage indices were not available, estimates were used.
2 Includes countries belonging to the extended EER group of trading partners (fixed
composition) and additionally the following 23 countries: Algeria, Argentina, Brazil,
Chile, Colombia, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, New Zea-
land, Peru, Philippines, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Taiwan,Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and United Arab Emirates. The ECB has suspended the
publication and calculation of the euro foreign exchange reference rate against Russian
rouble with effect from March 2, 2022 until further notice. For the calculation of
effective exchange rates, an indicative rate is used for the Russian Federation from that
date. It is calculated from the daily RUB/USD rates determined by the Bank of Russia in
conjunction with the respective ECB's euro foreign exchange reference rate to the US
dollar.  3 Annual and quarterly averages.  4 Euro area countries (from 2001 including
Greece, from 2007 including Slovenia, from 2008 including Cyprus and Malta, from

2015 including Lithuania, from 2023 including Croatia) as well as Canada, Denmark,
Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.
