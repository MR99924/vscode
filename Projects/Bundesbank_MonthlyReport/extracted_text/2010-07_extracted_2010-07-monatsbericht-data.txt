Underlying trends
The pace of growth in the German economy
picked up noticeably in the second quarter.
The sharply increased flow of orders since the
beginning of the year, which has also become
much more broadly based, provided the im-
petus for industrial enterprises to step up
their output substantially, and the construc-
tion sector, too, made rapid progress in clear-
ing weather-related backlogs in production.
Real gross domestic product (GDP) is there-
fore likely to have increased extremely sharply
in the second quarter of 2010. The percep-
tible improvement in the overall economic
situation is also reflected in the high degree
of satisfaction in the corporate sector. On-
going very dynamic growth in the world
economy was the main driving force behind
economic activity in Germany. Additionally,
more machinery and equipment is likely to
have been procured. The noticeably slower
decline in new registrations of non-
commercial cars, comparatively robust retail
sales, households’ high propensity to pur-
chase and notably positive developments in
the labour market suggest that a gradual sta-
bilisation of private consumption may be ex-
pected.
Industry
There was a very sharp 3.4% rise in industrial
output in May compared with April, for
which a seasonally adjusted increase of 1.0%
is reported following the upward revision of

6April and May together, there was an increase
of 5% on the first quarter. There was a very
sharp expansion in the production of inter-
mediate goods (+63/C254%). Capital goods, too,
showed marked growth (+51/C254%). This ap-
plies, in particular, to the automotive industry,
which is defined for statistical purposes as be-
longing to the capital goods sector. Owing to
the pick-up in demand for higher-quality
motor vehicles, output in the automotive sec-
tor was up by 10%. Mechanical engineering
likewise showed a sharp rise on the first quar-
ter of the year (+61/C252%). There was hardly any
change in consumer goods output, however.
Demand for industrial goods declined by a
seasonally adjusted1/C252% in May after having
risen noticeably in the two preceding months.
The main dampening factor was that orders
for motor vehicles fell by 31/C254% after an in-
crease of 91/C254% in April. Moreover, there was
a clear fall in demand for steel tubes, albeit
on the back of an exceptional 150% increase
in the previous month. By contrast, there was
a sharp increase in orders in the mechanical
engineering sector (+5%). On an average of
April and May, the volume of industrial orders
was 61/C252% up on the average of the first quar-
ter. The largest increases came from non-
euro-area countries (+9%), followed by the
domestic market (+53/C254%). Orders from other
euro-area countries were also up by 41/C252%,
however.
Compared with April, the increase in domes-
tic sales of industrial goods in May, at 23/C254%,
was roughly half as strong as export sales
(+51/C252%). On an average of these two
months, domestic business was 51/C254%u po nEconomic conditions in Germany*

7the first quarter and export business showed
an increase of 73/C254%. In terms of value, ex-
ports of goods – which have been exception-ally volatile for some months – were 9
1/C254%u p
on the month in May; there had been a 61/C254%
decline in April. On an average of the twomonths of April and May, exports of goodsshowed an increase of 6
1/C252% on the first
quarter. Nominal exports of goods grew by7% during the same period. The foreigntrade surplus fell slightly in May to 310
1/C252bil-
lion.
ConstructionConstruction activity in May continued to be
shaped by catching-up effects. Althoughthere was a seasonally adjusted month-on-month decline of 2
1/C254% in construction out-
put, the level of activity remained exception-ally high. Construction output on an averageof April and May was 16
1/C252%u po nt h e
weather-induced depressed level of the firstquarter. In civil engineering the figure was18% and was marginally lower in the build-ing industry at 15
3/C254%. Following two strong
preceding months, seasonally adjusted neworders in April – more recent data are unavail-able at present – were down markedly by5
1/C252%, although this was still well above the
average for 2009.
Labour marketThe labour market situation has improved
again noticeably. According to the provisionalfigures of the Federal Statistical Office, theseasonally adjusted number of persons inwork in May again showed a quite clear in-crease on the month (+38,000). This now
gives a year-on-year increase of 0.2%. Ac-cording to initial estimates, there was also afurther sharp rise in employment subject tosocial security contributions. There was a de-cline again not only in the number of newregistrations for (cyclically induced) short-time work but also in its actual use. Accord-ing to the statistics on short-time working(which have been rebased on a new method),short-time working benefits were probablypaid for economic reasons to 613,000 per-sons in April, compared with 742,000 per-sons in March and 1,443,000 in May 2009.According to the Federal Employment Agen-cy’s BA-X index for non-government-assistedjobs, there was a further improvement inJune in enterprises’ willingness to recruit newstaff. By contrast, there was no further rise inthe Ifo employment barometer.
Reflecting employment, there was a further
decline in unemployment. In June, the officialunemployment figure fell by a seasonally ad-justed 21,000 to 3.23 million. Although thismeant that the decline was no longer assharp as in the preceding months, on an aver-age of the second quarter there was still a fallof 130,000 compared with the first threemonths of the year. The unemployment ratein June, at 7.7%, was 0.6 percentage pointlower than in the previous year.
PricesCrude oil prices were not showing any clear
trend in June. The price fluctuations wereprobably due mainly to market players’ un-certainty about the outlook for global eco-

8nomic growth and, thus, for oil demand. At
US$76 per barrel on a monthly average, the
spot price for Brent North Sea oil in June was
21/C254% lower than in May. Owing to its depre-
ciation against the US dollar, there was a
slight1/C252% increase in euro terms, however.
As this report went to press, the spot price
stood at US$751/C254. Prices for future deliveries
of crude oil were, at times, being quoted
with higher premiums. At the end of the
period under review, US$13/C254and US$51/C252
were being charged for six-month and 18-
month deliveries respectively.
At the upstream stages of the economy,
prices in May did not increase as sharply as in
the two preceding months owing, above all,
to lower crude oil prices. If energy is ex-
cluded, the upward price trend continued un-
abated as a result of the upturn in the world
economy and the depreciation of the euro.
The stronger upward price pressure was espe-
cially obvious in the case of consumer goods,
although it weakened somewhat for inputs,
particularly imported intermediate goods.
The prices of imported capital goods con-
tinued to accelerate. Prices in domestic sales
remained unchanged. Overall, import prices
in May were no more than 0.2% up on the
month in seasonally adjusted terms, com-
pared with +1.2% excluding energy. The an-
nual HICP rate went up to 8.5%. The month-
on-month price rise in domestic sales of in-
dustrial products fell overall to 0.1%, or 0.5%
excluding energy. The 12-month rate went
up to 0.9%.
Consumer prices in June remained un-
changed on the month in seasonally adjustedterms following a slight fall earlier. This was
due to opposing movements in the individual
components. On the one hand, energy prices
eased slightly despite largely unchanged euro
crude oil prices. In addition, consumers had
to pay somewhat less for industrial goods in
seasonally adjusted terms. On the other
hand, food prices went up slightly. Services
prices rose somewhat, with more expensive
package holidays being a contributory factor.
The rise in rents remained moderate. The an-
nual CPI and HICP inflation rates, which were
both at 1.2% in May, fell to 0.9% and 0.8%
respectively. One factor behind this decline
was that a quite sharp increase in energy and
food prices 12 months previously is now no
longer affecting the year-on-year rate.
Public finances1
Local government finances
According to the latest cash statistics data
from the Federal Statistical Office for the first
quarter of 2010, local government posted a
deficit of 361/C252billion, compared with 33 bil-
lion a year earlier.2A perceptible decline in
revenue combined with a sharp rise in ex-
penditure increased the pressure on local gov-

appears in the Monthly Report, the emphasis is on recent

(published in February, May, August and November), by

ernment budget trends during the preceding quarter. For

9ernment budgets. Revenue fell by 31/C252% over-
all (- 311/C254billion). In particular, tax revenue
was down by almost 17% (- 32 billion) on the
year. On balance, this was almost exclusivelydue to a renewed sharp drop in local businesstax receipts (of one-fifth after deduction ofthe shares accruing to other governmentlevels). Furthermore, general grants fromstate government, which in most federalstates are linked to the level of tax revenue,also recorded a marked decline (-6% or 3
1/C252
billion). The fall in revenue was moderated, in
particular, by increases in other grants fromstate government, not least for investment aspart of the second economic stimulus pack-age.
At the same time, expenditure went up by
5
1/C252% (or 321/C254billion). Social benefits made
the largest contribution to this rise (+10% or31 billion). However, at +5% ( 3
1/C252billion),
growth in other operating expenditure wasalso very strong. Furthermore, the increase ofapproximately 3
1/C254billion in current transfers
to other entities indicates a continued out-sourcing of facilities. The rise of 9
1/C252%(31/C254bil-
lion) in spending on fixed asset formationwas completely financed by higher grantsfrom state government.
A significant increase in the deficit is expected
for 2010 as a whole. The May tax estimateprojects a fall in revenue of just over 4%. Fur-thermore, general grants from state govern-ment are also likely to decrease considerablyoverall. On the expenditure side, there aresigns of further strong growth in social bene-fits, and probably also in other operating ex-penditure. However, the sharp rise in spend-ing on fixed asset formation is expected to be
offset by higher grants, particularly as partof the second economic stimulus package.Overall, the local government deficit is likelyto rise to over 310 billion. At the same time,
the volume of cash advances (which are actu-ally only intended to bridge short-term liquid-ity shortfalls) is also likely to increase further,having already grown in recent years. In thefirst quarter of 2010 alone, the level increasedby32
1/C252billion compared with the end of
2009 to 3371/C252billion, with growth per capita
focused on the federal states of Saarland,Rheinland-Pfalz and North Rhine-Westphalia,which were, on average, already particularlyhighly indebted.Local government fiscal

10Statutory health insurance scheme
The statutory health insurance institutions
recorded a small surplus of 31/C254billion in the
first quarter of 2010, compared with a larger
surplus of 31 billion one year previously. Rev-
enue rose by 21/C252%, while growth in expend-
iture, at 41/C252%, was once again considerably
stronger. The transfers from the health insur-
ance fund were higher, particularly as a result
of the statutory increase in central govern-
ment funding. Thus, in the first quarter, the
health insurance institutions recorded one-
quarter of the non-recurring grant (amount-
ing to 33.9 billion in total) to offset cyclically
induced revenue shortfalls as revenue. On the
expenditure side, there was only a slight re-
duction in the upward trend.3The health insurance fund recorded a small
deficit of just over 31/C254billion after breaking
even in the same period last year. Unlike in
2009, central government transfers were not
brought forward. Therefore, the deficit pri-
marily reflects the less favourable revenue
trend typical for the beginning of the year,
which will improve considerably by the end of
the year. The revenue shortfalls resulting from
the cut in the contribution rate from 15.5%
to 14.9% in mid-2009 were offset by corres-
pondingly higher central government grants.
In consolidated terms, the health insurance
institutions and health insurance fund thus
recorded a small deficit.
Throughout the remainder of the year, the
health insurance fund is expected to record
higher revenue than in the first quarter and
payments to the health insurance institutions
are likely to be largely stable. Given that the
macroeconomic environment is more favour-
able than expected, the surplus is likely to ex-
ceed the planned accumulation of reserves of
30.8 billion. By contrast, the defined trans-
fers from the health insurance fund will not
be sufficient to cover the health insurance
institutions’ expenditure. The funding gap,
which could, however, be smaller than fore-
cast in autumn 2009 owing to a lower-than-
estimated increase in spending on benefits,
must be closed by drawing upon reserves or
demanding additional contributions. If add-
itional contributions are included, the statu-
tory health insurance system as a whole couldFinances of the statutory

11record a close-to-balance result for the year
as a whole.
According to the original plans, the health
insurance institutions would have had to con-
tend with a reduction in the Federal grant of
321/C252billion4on balance in 2011. On the basis
of the health insurance institutions’ expected
funding gap in 2010 and levels of growth in
expenditure continuing to significantly out-
weigh revenue expansion, a high deficit (of
around 310 billion) was clearly foreseeable
for 2011, which would have had to be com-
pletely offset by additional contributions. In
light of this, the Federal Government’s auster-
ity programme from the start of June already
included plans for a further extraordinary cen-
tral government grant of 32 billion for 2011.
With the measures additionally proposed on
6 July 2010, a substantial increase in addition-
al contributions, which would otherwise have
been required, can now largely be avoided.
Furthermore, the uniform contribution rate is
to be raised from 14.9% to 15.5%, resulting
in additional revenue of 361/C252billion. More-
over, cost savings of 331/C252billion are planned.
Furthermore, in line with recent decisions, the
financing system is to be restructured in such
a way that, in future, additional contributions
will no longer be capped and will be charged
only in the form of non-income-related con-
tributions per insured person. By contrast,
there is to be a fixed rate for income-related
contributions. So as not to place an excessive
burden on lower income earners who are
subject to compulsory insurance, a social
equalisation component is envisaged, where-
by, as a result of the contribution burdenbeing reduced by the employer (or the statu-
tory pension insurance scheme), higher net
income is paid out.5The resulting contribu-
tion shortfalls for the statutory health insur-
ance scheme are to be offset using tax rev-
enue. This opens up the possibility of gradual-
ly shifting the means of financing from social
contributions to a hybrid system, which will
additionally – and probably to an increasing
extent – encompass non-income-related health
insurance contributions and a tax-funded so-
cial equalisation component. The redistribu-
tion of income in the statutory health insur-
ance scheme would then no longer be fi-
nanced solely through contribution payers’
income subject to social security contributions
(up to the maximum level of earnings subject
to contributions), but also through general
taxation.
Securities markets
Bond market
In May 2010, the issue volume in the German
bond market was significantly down on the
month, grossing 387.2 billion (compared with
3118.2 billion in April). After deducting
4Under the original plans, the one-off grant of 33.9 bil-
lion would have been omitted, while the regular Federal
grant would have been raised from 311.8 billion to 313.3
billion.
5Social equalisation is to take place when the average
additional contribution of all contribution payers exceeds
2% of an individual’s income subject to insurance contri-
butions. The reason for basing calculations on the aver-
age additional contribution is to ensure that there is still
an incentive to select a low-price insurance institution. If
the respective actual additional contributions were to be
used as the basis, there would no longer be any incentive
for insured persons entitled to social equalisation to
switch to a lower-priced health insurance institution.Planned Federal

taking account of changes in issuers’ holdings
of their own bonds, net sales of domestic
debt securities amounted to 33.0 billion,
compared with 315.9 billion in April. Sales of
foreign debt securities totalled 30.4 billion; in
net terms, only instruments issued in foreign
currencies were placed in the market. There-
fore, the total volume of debt securities in
Germany outstanding increased by 33.5 bil-
lion in the reporting month.
Among domestic borrowers, the public sector
tapped the bond market for the greatest
amount in May ( 39.4 billion). Central govern-
ment was the primary issuer with net sales
of313.5 billion. It issued mainly five-year
Federal notes (Bobls) for 36.6 billion, two-
year Federal Treasury notes (Sch/C228tze) for 36.4billion as well as ten-year Federal bonds
(Bunds) for 35.7 billion and, to a lesser extent,
30-year Federal bonds ( 30.9 billion). Mean-
while, 35.9 billion worth of Treasury discount
paper (Bubills) was redeemed. The federal
states redeemed debt securities on balance
(34.2 billion) in the reporting month whereas
in April they had issued 31.8 billion worth of
debt securities.
Domestic credit institutions reduced their
capital market debt by 37.4 billion in May
after borrowing 35.2 billion net in April. They
mainly redeemed public Pfandbriefe and
other bank debt securities ( 34.5 billion and
33.5 billion, respectively) as well as, to a lesser
extent, mortgage Pfandbriefe ( 31.5 billion).
Specialised credit institutions were the sole
issuers, placing bonds worth 32.2 billion net
in the market.
In the reporting month, German enterprises
tapped the bond market for 31.1 billion,
significantly less than in the previous month
(34.9 billion). In net terms, these were all
short-term bonds with original maturities of
less than one year.
German non-banks were the main purchasers
of debt securities in May. They invested 340.6
billion in the bond market, predominantly in
foreign bonds ( 337.5 billion). Foreign invest-
ors invested 37.2 billion in the German bond
market purchasing, on balance, only public
debt securities. German credit institutions, by
contrast, sold 344.4 billion worth of interest-
bearing instruments, the vast majority of
which were foreign debt securities.Sales and purchases

13Equity market
In May, domestic enterprises issued hardly
any new shares in the German equity market
(30.2 billion). The outstanding amount of for-
eign equities in the German market increased
by33.5 billion. Equities were purchased al-
most exclusively by foreign investors ( 319.1
billion). In addition, resident non-banks pur-
chased 35.5 billion worth of shares, while
German credit institutions reduced their
equity holdings by 321.0 billion. In net terms,
this involved domestic instruments only.
Mutual fund shares
In the reporting month, German mutual
funds recorded an inflow of 38.5 billion net
(April: 38.4 billion). Specialised funds reserved
for institutional investors sold new shares for
33.5 billion while funds open to the public
were able to raise 34.9 billion. This flowed
primarily into equity funds ( 35.3 billion) and
to a lesser extent also into bond-based funds
(30.5 billion), mixed securities funds ( 30.4 bil-
lion) and money market funds ( 30.2 billion).
By contrast, open-end real estate funds re-
corded outflows of 31.5 billion. Foreign funds
traded on the German market redeemed in-
vestment certificates totalling 31.9 billion
after having recorded net sales of 32.7 billion
in April.
German non-banks were the principal invest-
ors in mutual funds, buying 33.2 billion
worth of instruments. Domestic credit institu-
tions and foreign investors each purchased
31.7 billion worth of investment fund shares.Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur-
plus – in unadjusted terms – of 32.2 billion in
May 2010. The result was thus 39.1 billion
down on the level of the previous month.
This was attributable to a narrower trade sur-
plus and to an increased deficit on invisible
current transactions, which comprise services,
income and current transfers.
According to provisional figures from the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, in May the foreign
trade surplus was down by 33.4 billion on the
month to 39.7 billion. The surplus also re-
corded a decline after adjustment for season-
al and calendar effects, namely by 32.2 billion
to310.6 billion. The value of imports rose
more sharply (+14.8%) than that of exports
(+9.2%). If April and May are taken together,
nominal exports were 6.5% above the aver-
age for the first quarter of 2010. Imports
were up by as much as 7.0%.
The deficit in invisible current transactions ex-
panded from 30.9 billion in April to 36.3 bil-
lion in May. This was due to the fact that a
surplus in both income balance and services
turned into a deficit. In the case of cross-
border income, this was largely attributable
to higher dividend payments to non-
residents. With respect to services, this was
due, in particular, to increased expenditure on
travel. By contrast, the deficit in current trans-
fers fell by 30.4 billion to 31.6 billion.
In May, cross-border portfolio investment re-
sulted in net capital imports of 326.2 billion,

14March and April. This was primarily attribut-
able to securities acquisitions by non-resident
investors in Germany ( 328.1 billion) who pur-
chased large quantities of German shares
(319.1 billion), after having disposed of do-
mestic shares on an even larger scale in the
previous month owing to the upcoming divi-
dend payment dates. In addition, they
bought bonds and notes ( 316.8 billion), with
their attention – on balance – being focused
exclusively on public debt securities ( 319.2
billion). By contrast, 39.5 billion worth of
money market paper was sold. German in-
vestors increased their investment abroad by
31.8 billion. While they purchased shares
(33.3 billion) and money market paper ( 31.5
billion), they disposed of mutual fund shares
(31.9 billion) and bonds and notes ( 31.1 bil-
lion).
Direct investment once again recorded net
capital outflows ( 36.0 billion). These were
largely the result of transactions by German
proprietors who provided their foreign affili-
ates with funds amounting to 39.7 billion,
primarily through intra-group loans. In May,
foreign enterprises supplied their foreign
branches with 33.7 billion in additional cap-
ital. Again, credit transactions between affili-
ated companies played a key role.
Other statistically recorded investment, com-
prising financial and trade credits (where
these do not constitute direct investment) as
well as bank deposits and other assets, saw
net outflows in May ( 331.1 billion, compared
with inflows of 31.5 billion in April). Counter
to overall developments, non-banks posted
capital inflows to the tune of 33.3 billion. InMajor items of the balance

17On the problems of macroeconomic imbalances
in the euro area
Since the beginning of the third stage of monetary union at the start of 1999, the combination
of strong growth in demand, relatively sharp inflation and severe erosion of price competitiveness
has led to persistently high current account deficits in a number of countries on the geographical
periphery of the euro area. The financial and economic crisis revealed that unsustainable devel-
opments at home were behind the substantial external imbalances of these euro-area countries.
Macroeconomic imbalances of this kind not only increase the economic and fiscal policy vulner-
ability of the countries in question; given the spill-over effects on the closely integrated euro-area
financial markets, they are also a hazard for other member states and, consequently, for the sin-
gle currency area as a whole. Furthermore, such imbalances seriously impede the implementation
of a uniform monetary policy that is geared to price stability. The debt crisis, which escalated in
some peripheral countries in the second quarter, and the stabilisation measures adopted at Euro-
pean level in response have clearly demonstrated the inherent risks.
Consequently, it is imperative to correct the imbalances that have arisen thus far and to prevent a
recurrence in the future. Such a reform agenda has to centre on measures to more closely align
domestic demand and potential output in deficit countries. As a first step, urgent action must be
taken to strengthen the driving forces for growth in the affected countries. However, in the me-
dium to long term, supply-side reforms do not necessarily lower external deficits. The economies
in question will therefore have no choice but to bring domestic demand back to a sustainable
level. Owing to the dramatic worsening of public finances, a determined fiscal consolidation is of
key importance. This is the only way, moreover, to restore the lost confidence in financial mar-
kets.
With regard to the opening question of correcting macroeconomic imbalances, therefore, the
bulk of structural adjustments required can be taken only by the deficit countries themselves.
Compensatory measures by euro-area countries with current account surpluses to stimulate do-
mestic demand, for instance by means of a more expansionary wage and fiscal policy, would nei-
ther adequately address the problem nor bring notable relief to deficit economies, given that
spill-over effects on the deficit countries are low. Instead, improved conditions for stability-
oriented monetary policy by ensuring that all euro-area countries pursue a sustainable economic
policy would constitute effective assistance for these countries.

18Euro-area countries during the financial
and economic crisis
The first ten years following the introduction
of the single currency marked a phase of
comparatively pronounced macroeconomic
stability. In addition to the remarkably high
level of monetary stability, the euro area ex-
perienced a phase of low real economic vola-
tility. However, below the surface of favour-
able economic conditions, this period also
saw the build-up of macroeconomic imbal-
ances in some countries. They became appar-
ent above all in high current account deficits
and eroding price competitiveness in a num-
ber of euro-area peripheral countries. But be-
hind these external variables are essentially
domestic imbalances: especially the expan-
sion of domestic demand that – measured in
terms of domestic potential output – was too
sharp, as well as an associated acceleration in
wage developments that were hurried along
in many cases by the domestic productivity
situation. Furthermore, demand in these coun-
tries was fuelled in part by an expansive fiscal
policy and in part by exaggerations in the real
estate markets.
The global financial and economic crisis has
brought to light the problems resulting from
these imbalances. The first decline in overall
economic output in the euro area since the
beginning of the third stage of monetary
union at the start of 1999 was recorded in
2009, when it fell by 4%. The economic
downturn was particularly pronounced in
the last few months of 2008 and the early
months of 2009. The export-oriented econ-
omies of Germany and Finland suffered thesharpest short-term losses. However, here the
downturn was primarily seen as a temporary
dip in external demand and, as a result, en-
terprises in Germany, as well as in other
export-oriented economies, did not imple-
ment any proportional changes in employ-
ment. Consequently, household consumption
demand remained relatively stable. The sharp
recovery in global trade, which started as
early as the second quarter of 2009, con-
firmed the expectations of enterprises and
households. In export-oriented economies,
growth in 2010 is likely to be well above the
euro-area average.
The recession in the peripheral countries
Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Greece, however,
took a different course. The slump in gross
domestic product (GDP) was initially much
weaker due to lower dependence on exports.
But ultimately, as the crisis progressed, it be-
came quite clear that not only recessionary
forces resulting from the global economy
were at play; home-grown problems, too,
were placing a further strain on the situation.
Overall, it transpired that these countries’
pre-crisis growth was not sustainable in the
long term. In Ireland and Spain, economic
overheating culminated in housing price bub-
bles. The related strong expansion of the con-
struction sector has since proven, to a large
extent, to have been exaggerated. Many jobs
have been lost in these two countries as a re-
sult of the subsequent need to reduce cap-
acity. In Spain alone, unemployment recorded
an increase of 23/C254million from the low in the
second quarter of 2007 to 41/C252million three
years later; this accounted for over half of the
increase in the entire euro area. The expect-Macroeconomic

19ation of a long drawn-out adjustment pro-
cess, bringing with it heavy job losses, has
prompted the Spanish and Irish to invest
more in precautionary savings since the out-
break of the economic crisis in the final quar-
ter of 2008. In both countries, the process of
adjusting the domestic real estate market is
proving to be a major strain on the banking
system.
While the Greek and Portuguese real estate
markets were not severely distorted in the
run-up to the crisis, domestic demand in
these countries, too, exceeded domestic pro-
duction capacity and incomes over a longer
period of time. Portugal was not able to halt
the rise in unit labour costs or boost potential
growth. Greek fiscal policy was charting a
very expansionary course that was unsustain-
able in the long term and which ultimately
plunged the country into the current debt cri-
sis.
Developments in Greece have clearly demon-
strated that persistent macroeconomic imbal-
ances of this kind occurring in closely inte-
grated financial markets of the single cur-
rency area cannot be contained within the
affected country. Under the conditions of a
single currency, persistent national imbal-
ances generate spill-over and contagion ef-
fects on other member states. As an upshot,
the necessary correction and adjustment pro-
cedure strains not only the economic pro-
spects of the affected economies but also the
stability of both the real economic framework
and the financial system of the entire cur-
rency area. With this in mind, this article an-
alyses the key factors that contributed to theescalation of the most recent crisis and exam-
ines elements of an essential adjustment
strategy to prevent similar problems occurring
in the future. Attention is focused on the di-
vergences in external balances and in indica-
tors of price competitiveness that have come
to light.
Development of current account balances
in the euro area – the statistics
Although no growing differences in macro-
economic growth rates and national inflation
rates have been recorded and the dispersion
of these figures has not markedly deviated
from those of other large currency areas since
the third stage of monetary union began in
1999, the development of current account
balances has nevertheless been extremely
heterogeneous. However, it is interesting to
note that the current account balance of the
euro area as a whole has fluctuated only be-
tween slight deficits and moderate surpluses
since the launch of monetary union. The
highest levels were recorded in 2000 and
2008 (deficits of 11/C252% and 13/C254% of GDP re-
spectively) as well as in 2002 and 2004 (sur-
pluses of1/C252%a n d3/C254% of GDP respectively).
Germany, with its high surpluses from trading
with non-euro-area countries, made a major
contribution to this by and large balanced
position. Had Germany been factored out of
the calculations, the euro area would have
had to bear current account deficits of be-
tween 3160 billion (2006), or 2.6% of GDP ,
and 3320 billion (2008), or 4.7% of GDP ,
since 2006. In this context, it should also be

20global market share at just under 10% be-
tween 1999 and 2008, whereas the group of
other euro-area countries sustained a 4 per-
centage point decline to 18%.
However, if the euro-area countries are con-
sidered individually, major differences become
apparent. The twelve member states that are
analysed here in greater detail can be roughly
divided into three groups. The four peripheralcountries Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland,
of which the first three joined the euro area
with sizeable current account deficits, posted
sharply rising deficits in particular in the
period from 2004 to 2007-2008. Immediately
prior to the global economic crisis, the deficits
ranged from 5.3% of GDP in Ireland (2007)
to 14.6% in Greece (2008). The second, mid-
table, group constitutes France, Italy and Bel-
gium, which started with surpluses and post-
ed moderate deficits in 2008. With a surplus
of 3.0% in 2008 that was only half of the
amount recorded in 1999, Finland has also
earned its place in this group. Of the mem-
bers of the third group, Austria and Germany
have a rather similar profile insofar as both
countries were able to turn slight deficits into
surpluses. The surplus recorded by the Neth-
erlands, which also belongs to this group,
peaked at 9.3% (2006).
As a consequence of stubborn current ac-
count deficits, the peripheral countries’ net
external position has worsened dramatically
over the years. As early as 1999, Spain, Portu-
gal and Greece recorded net deficits that
were, however, in a rather narrow range of
between 20% and 30% of GDP . Nonetheless,
up until the end of 2009, net liabilities in-
creased significantly, to around 97% in Spain
and 86% in Greece. In Ireland and Portugal,
the net debt item deteriorated to 55% and
92% respectively up to the end of 2008 (this
is the most recent information that is avail-
able to date). In the surplus economies, the
net external position may have improved, yet
the 2009 rates of 38% (Germany) and 18%
(Netherlands) were not especially high by
international standards. Since 2001, AustriaSource:  IMF. —  1 IMF  forecast  from  April

21has made significant progress in reducing its
negative balance to 14%.
A country’s current account position provides
vital information about its macroeconomicposition. It corresponds to the differencebetween aggregate savings (including thebalance on the capital account) and overallnet investment (gross investment less depreci-ation) of the country in question. In caseswhere aggregate savings are lower than in-vestment, a current account deficit showsthe aggregate savings gap that has to bebridged by lowering balances or by borrow-ing abroad.
1For instance, increasing external
debt in Spain and Ireland was driven chieflyby investments, whereas in Greece and Portu-gal declining savings activity in the economyas a whole was the main driver.
From an economic perspective, surpluses and
an improvement in the net external positionare advisable for countries, such as Germany,that are faced with an increasingly ageing so-ciety to absorb future demographically in-duced burdens. Channelling these savingsabroad allows domestic savers to diversify therisks of their assets and benefit from higheryields in fast-growing economies with a dif-ferent demographic profile.
Conversely, one should not criticise flat out
the fact that peripheral catching-up countriesin the euro area that have lower incomes tosupport the economic convergence process,which was greatly fuelled by the alignment ofinterest rates in the run-up to the third stageof monetary union, generated higher currentaccount balances for a time.

1In the economic literature, current account balances
are also considered to be the result of intertemporal sav-
ings and investment decisions (see M Obstfeld and
K Rogoff (1995), The intertemporal approach to the cur-
rent account, in G M Grossman and K Rogoff (eds),
Handbook of International Economics, Vol 3, pp 1731-
1799). Internationally integrated financial markets en-
able, for example, economies with higher growth poten-
tial to finance growth by borrowing abroad, ie to invest
more than can be funded through own savings. In the
model, given a comparatively smooth intertemporal de-
velopment of private consumption, sharp growth in sub-
sequent periods enables debts to be serviced and repaid.

Causes of the unsustainable development
of current account balances in the
euro-area peripheral countries
However, from a long-term growth perspec-
tive, these capital inflows from abroad were
in actual fact not allocated efficiently in the
peripheral countries. In Spain and Ireland, for
example, they were fed to a large extent into
the real estate markets. In Greece, they were
used to fund high government deficits and, in
Portugal, to support private consumption.3
Ultimately, it stands to reason that it is not
the current account deficits per se that
caused the current problems in the peripheral
countries, but the economically inefficient
use of capital provided from abroad.4
These capital inflows – and with them the
funding of current account deficits, too –
were accelerated by the disappearance of the
exchange rate risk as soon as monetary union
started, and country default risks in the euro-
area bond markets were rated very low in the
pre-crisis years.
Even before the start of monetary union, the
nominal yield differences between euro-area
countries had evened out considerably. How-
ever, with persistent differences between na-
tional rates of price change, this consequently
meant sizeable deviations in real interest
rates.5Due to comparatively strong inflation,
the ex post real interest rate (calculated on
the basis of domestic consumer prices) in theperipheral countries in the period from 1999
to 2008 was relatively low, especially in rela-
tion to the equilibrium real interest rate,
which can be approximated using the poten-
tial growth rate, for example. Viewed in isol-
ation, this greatly spurred demand and eco-
nomic activity in those countries, mainly in
the purely domestically oriented sectors, such
as construction, and drove inflation through051015202530354045%

24high wage growth. By contrast, real interest
rates in the price-stable core countries, in-
cluding Germany, were comparatively high –
meaning that, when viewed in isolation,
growth here was less strongly boosted.
The divergences in the current account bal-
ances that were already evident due to these
demand-side factors were probably further
intensified through the competitiveness chan-
nel. The higher inflation rates in the periph-
eral countries, which were mainly driven by
sharp rises in unit labour costs, slowed down
exports in real terms and boosted growth in
imports by weakening the position of domes-
tic suppliers on their home market. The indi-
cator of price competitiveness vis-/C224-vis other
euro-area countries (calculated on the basis
of the deflators of total sales) fell between1999 and 2008 by 15% for Spain, 4% for
Portugal and 7% for Greece. After a phase of
sharply negative development up until the
end of 2002 (-7%), the indicator for Ireland

until the start of 2007 but then trended
strongly upwards (see also explanations on
pages 39 to 55).
By contrast, Germany’s price competitiveness
grew steadily from 1999 to 2008 by a total of
12%. The improved competitiveness in this
economy was above all a result of moderate
wage policy which had been fostered by the
far-reaching reforms of the labour market. It
was predominantly a response of the decen-
trally active social partners to the highly
unsatisfactory situation on, and the impend-
ing further deterioration of the labour market
at the outset of the last decade. This about-
turn in wage policy was necessary to counter-
act previously misaligned labour costs and
thereby improve the conditions for sustained
growth and higher employment. However, it
initially reduced domestic demand. From mid-
2005, the expected creation of jobs surged
and unemployment figures fell from just
under 5 million at the beginning of 2005 to
just over 3 million in the final quarter of
2008. Furthermore, reforms were launched
and the social partners at corporate level
tapped flexibility potential, making the Ger-
man labour market much more resilient. The
most conspicuous sign of the success of these
efforts is the relatively low level of job cuts
during the recent recession. This is clear proof
of the benefits of labour market reforms and
wage moderation for the economy as a
whole. This should serve as an encouragingChange in price

25example for euro-area countries that are cur-
rently embarking on a similar adjustment pro-cess.
The aim of labour market reforms in Ger-
many was to render economic growth moreemployment-intensive. By contrast, improv-ing price competitiveness vis-/C224-vis other euro-area countries was not a central consider-ation. The strategy of increasing the employ-ment intensity of growth in order to bringabout a lasting reduction of structural un-employment would also have been successfuleven without the supporting effect of the    be a thing of the past, at least for the foresee-regained price competitiveness. The foremostconsequence of labour market reforms andof the moderate wage developments thatthey promote is a medium and long-termstrengthening of domestic activity. Wagemoderation is therefore in no way an inter-national zero-sum game where output gainsare realised at the expense of partner coun-tries (see annex on pages 33 to 38). This isspelled out by the fact that the German econ-omy generated sizeable growth stimuli forother euro-area countries in the final stagesof the last upturn.
The economic crisis: corrections since its
outbreak and their sustainability
Since the global economic crisis broke out in
2008, discrepancies in the euro-area coun-tries’ current account balances have nar-rowed again considerably. According to theIMF’s April 2010 forecast, the deficit in Spainin 2010 is likely to be only half as large as inthe pre-crisis boom years. By comparison, inPortugal and Greece the decline is likely to beless pronounced. At the same time, the bal-ances of the surplus countries have contract-ed slightly; the GDP ratio in Germany is likelyto fall to around 5
1/C252% in 2010. This thus
raises the question of the extent to which thisadjustment is cyclically induced or of a morepermanent nature.
One sign that the adjustment may be sustain-
able is that the extremely dynamic demandtrends in the deficit countries, as could be ob-served during the previous cycle, appear to
able future. On the one hand, the expansion-
ary growth stimuli from the process of inter-est rate convergence have finally subsided. Inresponse to a growing loss of confidence onthe capital markets, the interest rate differen-tial between the peripheral countries andGermany has widened greatly in recentmonths. On the other hand, import growthin the deficit countries over the next fewyears – in addition to indispensable generalgovernment consolidation measures to re-store confidence – is likely to be constrainedby households’ heightened savings activity.Ultimately, deficit countries are currently insearch of a new, more sustainable growthmodel. This adjustment process should be ac-companied and mitigated by structural re-forms to strengthen the domestic growthforces. The latter are required because – asdescribed above – the peripheral countries’high current account balances are not the ac-tual problem but are merely a reflection ofdomestic imbalances in the countries in ques-tion. In the short term, such measures arelikely to dampen domestic demand.

26However, in the medium term, it must not be
forgotten that the impact of supply-side re-
forms on a country’s current account position
cannot be forecast with any certainty. Where-
as measures that serve purely to curb demand
clearly reduce the current account deficits,
the impact of steps to boost demand are
not as clear-cut. For instance, significantly
strengthening potential output stimulates in-
vestment, which can result in higher inflows
from abroad. Successful cost cuts can also
lower the export value via prices and, in some
cases, even inflate nominal current account
losses.
In contrast to the deficit countries, tendencies
can currently be observed in the surplus
countries that are counteracting a return to
the high surpluses of the pre-crisis years. For
example, in Germany, a continuation of the
pronounced wage moderation of the last
decade is not to be expected in this form in
the current business cycle. This is due, on the
one hand, to the currently relatively favour-
able situation on the labour market. Should
economic recovery continue, the unions’ rela-
tive bargaining position is thus likely to be
much stronger than at the beginning of the
last decade. Furthermore, the unions’ aim of
halting the pronounced shift in the distribu-
tion of income in favour of enterprises, or at
least reversing this shift to some degree,
could have an impact on future wage devel-
opments. On the other hand, due to demo-
graphic developments, fewer and fewer
young people are likely to enter the labour
market, thus rapidly stepping up competition
among firms for new and highly qualified
workers.Need to adjust economic policy in the
euro area: symmetry or asymmetry?
In view of the fact that the deeper causes of
the imbalances are to be found in domestic
economy factors within the deficit countries,
it is indisputable that the necessary adjust-
ments are to be made first and foremost in
those countries. For instance, it is vital that
these economies get back on a sustainable
path by consolidating public budgets and
implementing structural reforms. Experience
has shown that the adjustments required in
the area of wage growth can be implement-
ed in a considerably more rapid and sustain-
able way if measures to increase labour mar-
ket flexibility are implemented and incentives
to take up employment are improved by mak-
ing changes to the social security system, for
example.6As the deficit countries bear the
brunt of the adjustment burden, the respect-
ive adjustment requirements are distributed
asymmetrically between deficit and surplus
countries.
The need for decisive supportive economic
policy measures in the deficit countries is also
backed by the fact that major market adjust-
ment channels for a more extensive sustain-
able reduction of the diverging current ac-
count balances in the euro area, where rela-
tive prices can no longer be adjusted through
nominal exchange rate shifts, were not par-
ticularly pronounced in the past. This includes
the cross-border migration of workers. In the

27last few decades, labour mobility in the euro
area has been rather low, especially com-pared to the USA, not least due to languagebarriers. This adjustment mechanism mayplay a greater role in the future, that is if un-employment takes hold in the peripheralcountries; however, its significance shouldnot be overstated.
In addition to necessary reform efforts in the
deficit countries, recent public debate on thestrategies required to achieve a sustainablereduction of macroeconomic imbalances inthe euro area has also focused on economicpolicy in the surplus countries. Here the rec-ommendation is often that these economiesshould also play their part in reducing exter-nal discrepancies within the euro area by, forinstance, increasing domestic demand, andthus imports, through higher government ex-penditure or wage acceleration. This wouldlower their current account surplus and helpdeficit countries make the necessary adjust-ments by providing an expansionary stimulus.Such a scenario where deficit and surpluscountries alike work towards reducing dis-crepancies is known as symmetrical adjust-ment.
However, this preference for symmetrical ad-
justment is based on assumptions which,when analysed in more detail, prove to be in-valid. From an empirical point of view, onevital prerequisite would be that the relevantmeasures in surplus countries actually have anotable impact on deficit countries. However,phantasms of mechanistic control for coun-tries with different current account positionsgenerally ignore that, in reality, an economy’strade activities are divided into numerous
smaller flows to many different countries. Itshould be noted in particular that every meas-ure taken by a surplus country with the aimof triggering an external impact often hasonly a relatively small effect on the deficitcountry if the trade links between the surplusand the deficit country are not particularly de-veloped. This is precisely the case for relationsbetween Germany and the euro-area periph-eral countries we are looking at here. Even ifdemand in Germany shoots up in the shortterm, this would not make much of a contri-bution towards reducing current account def-icits in most of the peripheral countries. Forexample, for the given country weights, ifGerman imports were to rise by 10%, thefirst-round effect would be that the currentaccount balance in Spain, Portugal andGreece would improve by only
1/C254percentage
point; the effect would be more pronouncedonly in the case of Ireland, where it wouldamount to one percentage point. Further-more, the higher demand for imports in Ger-many would also benefit those economiesthat have a trade surplus. These consider-ations alone illustrate that, essentially, theproblem of large current account deficits canbe solved only by the affected countriesthemselves.
Proposals for symmetrical adjustment often
centre on wages and prices in the assumptionthat using real effective depreciation as ameans of wage moderation would first andforemost shift output from abroad to thehome markets. This effect could be further in-tensified by wage acceleration abroad. Ger-many has sometimes been accused, especiallySymmetrical

28by fellow Europeans, of expanding its overall
economic output in recent years at the ex-
pense of its neighbours and is now expected
to shore up demand in partner countries. This
line of reasoning neglects, on the one hand,
the fact that wage adjustments are no direct
political control variable but, in market econ-
omies, are rather the result of decentralised
decisions taken by social partners at sector or
firm level. Furthermore, characterising wage
setting behaviour as a tool that serves primar-
ily to shift output between nations is quite
simply wrong. The main effects of macroeco-
nomic changes in wage setting behaviour are
felt almost entirely in the home economy,
above all through changes in employment.
The effects on the external balance items are,
by contrast, less important in quantitative
terms and, in addition, not clear ex ante inqualitative terms. This is also demonstrated
by simulations as part of standard macroeco-
nomic models (see annex on pages 33 to 38).
In addition to wages as a potential way of in-
creasing demand in surplus countries, advo-
cates of a symmetrical adjustment strategy
also cite fiscal policy as a possible instrument.
For example, it has been proposed that Ger-
many, in particular, should use tax cuts to in-
crease government expenditure or stimulate
private consumption. However, this argument
disregards the fact that the public finance
situation is tense in Germany, too, and has
given rise to a need for consolidation, not
least due to the constitutional provisions of
the debt brake and the commitments made
by the German government as part of the ex-
cessive deficit procedure initiated by the Euro-Exports by euro-area partners to Germany *

29pean Commission. Another valid point here is
that the effects of such a strategy – given thelow spill-over effect between the euro-areacountries, which can realistically be assumed –would disappoint ambitious expectations.Overall, it is more likely that macroeconomicrelief in the countries with current accountdeficits would be negligible, whereas the fis-cal policy situation in the countries with cur-rent account surpluses would deteriorate sig-nificantly. This is not a sensible macroeco-nomic adjustment strategy for countries in amonetary union.
A recent examination of current account di-
vergences in the euro area by the EuropeanCommission has correctly determined the es-sence of these theoretical and empirical con-siderations – that neither strong exports northe fiscal policy situation in the surplus coun-tries constitute the problem, and that itwould therefore not be sensible to weakenGermany’s price competitiveness or its fiscalpolicy framework.
7The OECD ultimately also
comes to this conclusion and proposes, aboveall, stepping up structural reforms to stimu-late domestic demand in Germany. In particu-lar, it recommends implementing further la-bour market reforms as well as deregulatingservices and product markets, improving taxtreatment of the promotion of research andreforming the education system.
8From the
German perspective, these measures makegood sense. It is safe to assume, however,that these measures will make little contribu-tion towards easing adjustment requirementsin the euro-area deficit countries.The advocates of the proposals for symmet-
rical adjustment fear that a reduction of do-mestic demand in the peripheral countrieswithout compensatory actions in surpluscountries will result in a general shortage ofaggregate demand in the euro area. In theworst case scenario, this could plunge theeuro area into recession again, which wouldhamper both fiscal consolidation and thebuild-up of competitive output capacity.However, for various reasons, these argu-ments are too short-sighted. As mentionedabove, the naive view of a mechanistic shiftof demand between deficit and surplus coun-tries – given the low spill-over effects in theeuro area – is misguided as far as wage andfiscal policy is concerned. What is more, thisline of reasoning overlooks the fact that realeconomic recovery in the euro area is essen-tially intact despite the adjustment require-ments in the deficit countries. According tothe most recent Eurosystem projections, thereal GDP growth rate both this and next yearis likely to be lower than prior to the econom-ic crisis. However, even after fiscal stimuliand considerable consolidation efforts haveceased, economic development is not likelyto slip back into recession over the forecasthorizon (see box on pages 30 and 31). Ultim-ately, advocates of symmetrical adjustmentdisregard the fact that – even in a risk scen-ario of an upturn in the euro area that ismuch weaker than currently expected – thereare more effective means of countering ageneral shortage in aggregate demand in

To more a ccurately gau ge the extent of su ch ﬁ scal

euro-area countries, the simulation is broken down into 
two variations. In variation 1, only Germany un dergoes 
consoli dation; in variation 2, the remainin g euro-area 
countries un dergo consoli dation. The ﬁ  rst simulation 
determines the impa ct of consoli dation in Germany on 
euro-area partner countries. The se con d variation deter-
mines the effe ct of consoli dation in the other euro-area 
countries on Germany. They show that pro duction short-
falls in euro-area partner countries whi ch result from 
consoli dation in Germany are consistently small, an d 
that a num ber of Germany ’s imme diate nei ghbours are

that consoli dation in Germany woul d ena ble monetary

Conversely, the German e conomy is barely affe cted by

Thus, con current consoli dation in Germany an d the

32deficit countries than compensation from sur-
plus countries. This applies primarily to the
role of monetary policy.
The primary mandate of Eurosystem monet-
ary policy is safeguarding price stability for
the entire currency area. This means that it
generally cannot allow itself to take account
of economic problems in individual countries.
The macroeconomic constellation outlined
above may nevertheless create monetary pol-
icy scope insofar as reducing aggregate de-
mand in some economies paired with the
fiscal consolidation required of all member
states, viewed in isolation, could curb infla-
tion in the euro area as a whole. Monetary
policy geared towards price stability would be
able to take this into consideration when esti-
mating the price outlook and the resulting
policy stance. This would limit the risk of a
short-term recovery course in the euro area
being slowed by retarding fiscal and wage
factors.
Conclusion
All in all the large current account deficits of
the European peripheral countries in the past
few years are a testament to imbalances in
domestic economic activities: measured in
terms of domestic potential output, demand
was too high. Imbalances of this kind in parts
of a single currency area give cause for
concern and, in view of the resulting size-
able macroeconomic adjustment require-
ments, not only in the affected countries.
Given the spill-over effects on the closely inte-
grated euro-area financial markets, they arealso a hazard for other member states and,
consequently, for the single currency area as
a whole. Furthermore, such imbalances ser-
iously impede the implementation of a uni-
form monetary policy that is geared to price
stability. The debt crisis, which escalated in
some peripheral countries in the second quar-
ter, and the stabilisation measures adopted at
European level in response have clearly dem-
onstrated the inherent risks.
Consequently, it is imperative to correct the
imbalances that have arisen thus far and to
prevent a recurrence in the future. Such a re-
form agenda has to centre on measures to
more closely align domestic demand and po-
tential output in deficit countries. In addition
to structural reforms, especially on the labour
market, the agenda should include the con-
solidation of public budgets in particular. Fur-
thermore, regulatory measures should be put
in place to counter future exaggerations in
the real estate market in peripheral countries.
In the medium to long term, supply-side re-
forms do not necessarily lower external def-
icits. The economies in question will therefore
have no choice but to bring domestic de-
mand back to a sustainable level.
With regard to the opening question of cor-
recting macroeconomic imbalances, there-
fore, the bulk of structural adjustments re-
quired can be taken only by the deficit coun-
tries themselves. Compensatory measures by
euro-area countries with current account sur-
pluses to stimulate domestic demand would
neither adequately address the problem nor
bring notable relief to deficit economies,

33countries are low. Instead, improved condi-
tions for stability-oriented monetary policy by
ensuring that all euro-area countries pursue a
sustainable economic policy at home would
constitute effective assistance for these coun-
tries.
Given the critical impact of country-specific
domestic problems on the entire euro area, it
is also appropriate to tighten the fiscal policy
commitment procedures and macroeconomic
surveillance in the euro area. A debate on re-form has since begun for both issues. While it
is broadly uncontested that the fiscal policy
rules of the Stability and Growth Pact need to
be tightened, the attempt to establish more
effective macroeconomic surveillance is large-
ly new territory. It is vital to set up effective
procedures that are restricted to significant
imbalances in the form of macroeconomic
vulnerabilities in the affected countries. Ex-
tensive macroeconomic fine-tuning and co-
ordination by supranational bodies should,
however, be rejected.
Annex
Macroeconomic effects of wage moderation
The effects of an altered orientation in wage set-
ting in the context of the euro area can be appro-
priately demonstrated using simulations of macro-
economic models. This is illustrated below for two
of the models used by the Bundesbank. The pri-
mary purpose of the simulations is to identify the
main transmission channels, and also, in particular,
repercussions on other euro-area countries.
Simulations using NiGEM
With the aid of the multi-country model NiGEM of
the National Institute of Economic and Social Re-
search (NIESR), the effects of wage moderation in
their entirety, including the impact on other econ-
omies, can be depicted.9In this model, the (real)
hourly wage W=P is determined using an esti-
mated equation, according to which it rises with
increasing productivity Y= L but falls with increas-
ing unemployment Uas the negotiating power of
the employees weakens in relation to the positionof the employers. The influence of all other deter-
minants is encapsulated in one term /C11:
lnðWt=PtÞ¼/C11þlnðYt=LtÞ/C0/C12Ut.
In the following, wage moderation is understood
as a permanent reduction in the wage level vis-/C224-
vis a baseline. Such a shock can be implemented in
NiGEM in various ways. First, the equation for
determining the hourly wage can be replaced by a
specific change value (exogenous shock). Second,
the structural relationship described in the equa-
tion can, in principle, be left intact by merely shift-
ing the level by modifying the term /C11.10For such
an endogenous shock, the impact of other macro-
economic variables on the shock variable itself – in
this case, the influence of induced changes in

34productivity and the unemployment rate on the
hourly wage – continues to be taken into consider-
ation. This can be particularly significant if the
rule-based responses of monetary policy are to be
taken into account. Admittedly, by considering the
feedback effects ex ante it is nearly impossible to
gauge to what extent the variable concerned
changes ex post after an endogenous shock,
which, above all, makes a cross-country compari-
son more difficult. By contrast, an exogenous
shock fixes the (final) change in the hourly wage
and nevertheless illustrates the underlying complex
macroeconomic impact of wage moderation.
Therefore, depending on the question at hand,
either an exogenous or an endogenous wage
shock is assumed.
In NiGEM the major economies are depicted by
modules with the same structure, with the respect-ive parameters having been estimated using the
economies’ historical data. Therefore, even an
identical exogenous shock produces quantitatively
different macroeconomic effects in a cross-country
comparison. Despite the concrete results ranging
considerably in some cases, a consistent response
pattern clearly emerges from the separate simula-
tions of a permanent exogenous reduction in the
(nominal) wage level vis-/C224-vis the baseline in the
euro-area member states.11The informative value

that in each case the nominal hourly wage is permanently
reduced by 1% in one country only. Monetary policy in-
fluences are suppressed by fixing the nominal key interest
rates in the euro-area for an extended period. The

35depends not least on the extent to which the em-
pirical interactions depicted in NiGEM still existtoday.
Since prices are rigid in the short term, a nominal
reduction in the hourly wage translates into a realshock. As a general rule, the goods prices inNiGEM are derived from the production costs plusa mark-up. Therefore, in the wake of a reductionin wages, prices are likewise progressively lowered.Nevertheless, in real terms, the wage falls belowthe baseline in the long term too. This primarily in-creases firms’ labour demand, leading to growth inemployment. Consequently, an economy’s poten-tial output rises. Employment growth also resultsin a firm’s capital stock being increased to providemachinery and equipment for the newly createdworkplaces. With potential output, aggregate de-mand also increases in the long term. But in theshort term it is depressed, particularly by privateconsumption, because lowering the hourly wagealso reduces the income of the labour force up tothen. However, in the medium to long term, thiseffect on aggregate wage income is more thancompensated for by the strong growth in employ-ment.
12
The external effects of wage moderation must alsobe taken into consideration. As a result of a reduc-tion in production costs, export prices are alsolowered. As domestic products are now cheaperthan the goods of other economies, internationaldemand is diverted in favour of domestic productsand the export volume rises perceptibly. Nonethe-less, the rise in real exports remains below the in-crease in real GDP and, above all, below growth inprivate investment. Therefore, foreign trade is byno means the driver of the macroeconomic effectsof wage moderation, as is often asserted. Further-more, the reduction in the prices of domesticgoods compared with those of foreign products re-
sults in import substitution to a certain extent only.Since, if potential output increases, aggregate de-mand also rises in the long term, import demandmust be higher, if viewed in isolation. For the euroarea as a whole, on average this impact of the shiftin the level of domestic demand dominates thesubstitution effect from the relative price change,resulting in the volume of imports somewhat ex-ceeding its baseline level.
While the redirection of the trade volumes in fa-
vour of the home country thus has a comparativelyweak impact overall, the terms of trade deteriorateconsiderably as a result of the real depreciation.The values show that the price effect even out-weighs the impact of the shifts in the real tradeflows and, in the long term, the (nominal) currentaccount balance falls somewhat in relation to thebaseline. A further consequence is that aggregateoutput abroad hardly changes. It should bestressed that there is no drop in production in thepartner countries and the overall effect in the longterm tends rather to still be slightly positive. This isprimarily due not only to the fact that the effect ofredirecting the trade volumes, which is in any caseweak, is spread over many partner countries, butalso to the fact that foreign countries mainly bene-fit from a rise in purchasing power as a result ofthe improvement in their terms of trade.
Conversely, particularly in the case of aggregate
underemployment, wage acceleration, which pro-
12Nevertheless, in some economies, private consump-
tion, in line with households’ real disposable income, falls
below the baseline in the long term as well. This is likely
to be mainly due to the loss of income resulting from the
reduction in export prices. In the latest available version
of NiGEM, NIESR has adjusted the behaviour of export
prices so that private consumption is no longer reduced
in the long term. The current account response is also af-
fected by this. The simulation results presented here are
based on NIESR’s version of NiGEM from January 2010.Domestic

36duces the opposite macroeconomic effects, cannot
be beneficial, either from a domestic or a foreign
perspective. In order to illustrate the effects of a
symmetric adjustment, (simultaneous) wage mod-
eration in Greece, Portugal and Spain is combined
with wage acceleration in Germany. Endogenous
shocks are applied to the respective wage equa-
tions so that the macroeconomic repercussions
– and, in a subsequent step, also the impact of a
monetary policy response – can be depicted intheir entirety. The shocks are calibrated in such a
way that the long-term increase in the (real) prod-
uct wage in Germany compensates ex post for the
decline in the southern European countries,
weighted by their economic output.13The example
of Greece, for instance, confirms that although the
real effective depreciation of a deficit country is in-
creased by wage acceleration in a major surplus
country, the effect is small. Above all, however,
compared with the situation where the adjustment
is limited to the selected deficit countries, the ag-
gregate output of the deficit country is by no
means further increased. In the euro-area aggre-
gate, the significant fall in output, which the Ger-
man economy would be confronted with in the
long term owing to higher wages, would compen-
sate for GDP gains in the wake of the decline in
wages in the southern European countries.
Finally, a strategy is analysed in which all euro-area
economies engage in wage moderation.14The real
effective depreciation of a deficit country such as
Greece is then notably weaker than is the case if
the upward pressure on wages is only moderated
in some member states and increases further in
others. Nevertheless, the deficit country benefits
from wage moderation in the euro area as a
whole, as its economic output receives an add-
itional boost from purchasing power effects and
shifts in the level of demand in the other member
states. With regard to the strong increase in euro-

37moderation in the preceding simulations has a
major impact. Since the inflation rate for the euroarea as a whole is significantly curbed in thisscenario, a stability-oriented monetary policy canalso tackle short-term drops in demand in thewake of wage moderation by giving a certainamount of free rein.
Simulations with the Bundesbank DSGE modelIn addition to the simulations carried out using
NiGEM, the macroeconomic effects of wage mod-eration in deficit countries are analysed using anextended version of the Deutsche Bundesbank’sdynamic stochastic general equilibrium model(baseline DSGE model).
15Compared with NiGEM,
whose structure is based on econometrically esti-mated behavioural equations, the strength of theDSGE models lies in a rigorous microeconomicfoundation of macroeconomic relationships. TheBundesbank model can depict three different re-gions and, for the purposes of the simulation inquestion, is calibrated with the corresponding datato Germany, southern Europe (Greece, Portugaland Spain) and the rest of the euro area. Valuescommonly used in the literature are taken to deter-mine the structural parameters.
16The single mon-
etary policy in the monetary union focuses, in par-ticular, on the objective of price stability in theeuro area as a whole.
First, the genesis of the current account imbal-
ances in the euro area is reproduced in the model.Since the deterioration in the current account bal-ances in southern Europe is largely due to the de-cline in the private saving ratio, differences in sav-ings behaviour in Germany and in southern Europeare assumed in the DSGE model. These are mod-elled using a time preference shock,

agents in southern Europe favour current consumption
over future consumption and thus save less. At the same
time, households in Germany save more to the same ex-
tent, while in the rest of the euro area there is no time

38in Germany and to a high current account deficit
in southern Europe. Furthermore, the current con-
sumption restraint in Germany, implied by a
stronger preference for future consumption, indir-
ectly results in an increase in the supply of labour
and thus a decline in the real wage.18As exactly
the opposite labour market responses are pro-
duced in southern Europe, the reverse develop-
ment of production costs causes divergent
changes in price competitiveness within the euro
area.
In a further step, based on the existing current ac-
count imbalances in the euro area, wage moder-
ation scenarios in southern Europe are analysed
using a wage mark-up shock.19A temporary re-
duction in the wage mark-up (a temporary real
wage decline) in southern Europe triggers a sharp
rise in employment and – in tandem with this –
growth in investment in this region. Aggregate
output increases in the medium term. Thanks to
the relative real wage decline, goods in southern
Europe can be produced more cheaply and there-
fore their price competitiveness within the euro
area improves. Export volumes rise as a result of
this real depreciation. However, at the same time,
real imports also increase because growth in out-
put induces higher domestic demand. The current
account hardly changes initially, while in the me-
dium term it improves slightly. In Germany, there is
a slight improvement in the current account bal-
ance in the short term, owing to growth in imports
being weaker than that of exports.
In the case of permanent wage moderation (per-
manent real wage decline), the expansionary ef-
fects on employment, investment and aggregateoutput in southern Europe become more intense
and more prolonged. Consequently, the current
account in southern Europe even deteriorates
owing to increased investment.
Common results
The simulations using NiGEM and the Bundes-
bank’s DSGE model illustrate that dampened wage
growth primarily affects the domestic labour mar-
ket by reducing underemployment. Furthermore,
the creation of new jobs necessitates an expansion
of the capital stock and leads to a sharp rise in in-
vestment. By contrast, the redirection of the inter-
national flows of goods as a result of the shift in
the relative prices plays only a subordinate role in
quantitative terms. The simulations with both
models show that, contrary to expectations, the
nominal current account balance can even deteri-
orate. However, because this is due to an increase
in the domestic economy’s performance and not,
for example, to excessive domestic demand, this is
not an unsustainable development.
Where there is high unemployment, wage moder-
ation is thus likely to pave the way to increased
employment and growth. By contrast, more mod-
erate wage development is, in some cases, a less
suitable means of correcting large current account
deficits. This essentially requires excessive domestic
demand to be curbed.
18The supply of labour in the model is positively depend-
ent not only on the real wage but also on the marginal
utility of consumption, since the economic agents’ pro-
pensity to work decreases with increasing prosperity.
19Since employees in the model have a certain degree
of market power, they demand a wage mark-up, the size
of which depends on their market power.Wage

39Nominal and real exchange rate movements
during the financial crisis
Over the past three years, the international financial markets and the global economy alike were
roiled by crisis. Nominal and real exchange rates, which are affected to a similar degree by devel-
opments in the financial markets and the real sector, were a kind of seismograph of the various
phases of the crisis. This article describes the exchange rate movements of the key global curren-
cies and exchange rate policy responses to the crisis, while at the same time seeking to identify
the relevant determinants of each of the different phases of the crisis.
From mid-2007, the financial and economic crisis led to violent exchange rate fluctuations,
which impacted quite unevenly on the currencies of major industrial countries, however. Where-
as, for example, the euro and the US dollar each underwent a see-saw pattern of appreciation
and depreciation, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc posted considerable net gains. By
contrast, the value of pound sterling is now significantly lower than prior to the outbreak of the
crisis.
During the financial crisis, exchange rates were determined not only by traditional factors but
also, to a major extent, by anxiety among market participants, which led to a flight to safe invest-
ments and an unwinding of risky transactions – such as currency carry trades. From December
2009, Greece’s severe budget problems also figured prominently in the euro’s declining value.
The crisis-related changes in the exchange rate relationships and prices have caused shifts – some
temporary, some enduring – in the competitive positions of the most important currency areas.
Within the euro area, the differences in the individual countries’ competitive positions have, to
date, not diminished noticeably for the most part, however.
The tensions in the foreign exchange markets associated with the financial and economic crisis
have led in various countries to policy interference in foreign exchange markets, such as interven-
tion and capital controls. Such interference, however, has been restrained compared with past
periods of severe global recession and turmoil in the financial markets – such as the Great
Depression of the 1930s. Given the resulting virtual absence of exchange rate policy conflicts
that hamper economic recovery, this may be regarded as a success.

40Exchange rate movements of major
currencies during the financial crisis
In the summer of 2007, the tensions in the
US mortgage market spilled over to the inter-
national financial markets. Although, at that
time, market participants were still bullish
overall about global economic activity, the US
economic outlook clouded over given the
very advanced stage of the business cycle and
the burdens that the crisis was threatening to
cause. This gave rise to heightened expect-
ations regarding a reorientation of US monet-
ary policy, thus putting the US dollar under
pressure against key currencies. The Federal
Reserve did indeed cut interest rates several
times starting in September 2007, gradually
reducing the interest rate advantage of short-
term US dollar-denominated investments
against, for instance, euro-denominated
counterparts, and leading to an interest-rate
disadvantage starting in January 2008. In
spring 2008, the effective exchange rate of
the US dollar against 21 trading partners hit
an all-time low. Amidst the great tension in
the UK financial system, the pound sterling
likewise came under massive downward pres-
sure in autumn 2007. Unlike the US dollar,
however, the pound sterling had previously
been quite strong.
The US dollar’s downward slide was brought
to an abrupt halt in mid-July 2008, when it
became clear that the financial crisis had
reached a second stage in which it would in-
creasingly encroach into the real sector in all
major currency areas. In addition, the Lehman
Brothers bankruptcy in September 2008 trig-
gered a massive global shock to confidence.The upshot was a considerable decline in risk
appetite on the financial markets and a with-
drawal of funds, especially from emerging
market economies, by internationally active
investors.
The US dollar derived particular benefit from
the fall in risk appetite, as investment in this
currency area was regarded as particularly
liquid and low-risk (a “safe haven”) despite
the fact that the United States was the epi-
centre of the crisis. In addition, the repatri-
ation of investment to the United States and
banks’ mutual distrust – especially with re-
gard to cross-border lending – led to a “dollar
shortage”, in response to which the Federal
Reserve concluded swap agreements with
several other central banks, including the
Eurosystem.Effective exchange rates of

41Owing to its role as a “safe haven”, the Swiss
franc also appreciated markedly during thatperiod. After briefly falling, owing, amongother things, to intervention by the Swisscentral bank in the foreign exchange mar-kets, the Swiss franc subsequently continuedits upward movement – initially, in part, evendespite further intervention.
1The Swiss franc
is one of those currencies that emerged fromthe crisis with a massive increase in its value.
Aside from the diminishing risk appetite, the
growing tension in the financial markets dur-ing this second phase of the crisis was associ-ated with exceptionally high exchange ratevolatility, which resulted not only in Japanesehouseholds and firms scaling back their over-seas investments but also a massive unwind-ing of currency carry trades and a significant(effective) appreciation of the yen. On aweighted average against 21 trading part-ners, the yen, after having previously alreadytended upwards – amidst sharp fluctuations –gained around 35% in value between end-July 2008 and end-January 2009.
In contrast to the US dollar, the pound ster-
ling continued its slide until the end of 2008.The pound sterling’s slump had two causes.One was the major importance of the finan-cial industry for the UK economy, where thesituation continued to deteriorate in theautumn months of 2008 with the collapse ofLehman Brothers. The other was that theBank of England cut interest rates sharply inNovember and December 2008, intensifyingselling pressure on the pound sterling. Over-all, the pound fell by just under 25% on aweighted average against 21 trading partners
over the course of 2008.
In the late summer of 2008, the euro – fol-
lowing many years of upward drift and asurge in the first phase of the crisis – initiallyfell distinctly in effective terms against 21trading partners upon news that the globalspillover of the financial crisis had caused theeuro-area economic outlook to grow consid-erably dimmer. The most severe losses weresustained against the US dollar and the yen.The euro’s slump persisted until October2008, when the euro was down to as low asUS$1.25 and ¥116, and was thus 22% and32% respectively below its highs in July2008.Implied volatility of foreign

42Whereas the euro-yen exchange rate subse-
quently fluctuated in a corridor of between
¥117 and ¥128 without a clear trend, the ex-
pansionary monetary and fiscal policy in the
United States led to a renewed appreciation
of the euro against the US dollar. For in-
stance, in mid-December the euro, following
the Federal Reserve’s move to a “zero-inter-
est” policy, soared from US$1.30 to more
than US$1.46 within a period of just six trad-
ing days. However, that still left it slightly
more than 8% below its high in July 2008.
The euro also picked up noticeably in the
autumn months against the pound sterling
and other currencies that had been particular-
ly affected by the slump in global economic
activity and global trade. On balance, the
euro appreciated in effective terms by 21/C252%over the course of 2008 and reached its peak
to date in mid-December.
In the second quarter of 2009, government
assistance for the financial sector, extensive
economic stimulus packages and central
banks’ support measures in the key industrial
countries led to a stabilisation of global activ-
ity and a gradual recovery in the financial
markets. Exchange rate volatility – which is
usually cited as a measure of uncertainty in
the foreign exchange markets – likewise re-
ceded distinctly over the course of 2009, and
most currencies, especially those of many
east Asian countries and some commodity
exporting nations, successfully recovered a
large percentage of their losses. The Chinese
renminbi, however, was largely detached
from this development; in the second half of
2008 the Chinese monetary authorities, hav-
ing allowed a trend appreciation against the
dollar between July 2005 and July 2008,
largely re-pegged the renminbi to the US dol-
lar. Only since June 2010 has China again
been making somewhat greater use of the
envisaged fluctuation margin of the renminbi,
causing the Chinese currency to appreciate
slightly on balance.
Now that the financial markets have calmed
down, risk appetite, and thus also currency
carry trade activity, are likely to have gone
back up. According to market participants,
this has put the US dollar, which has been
increasingly used as the currency for funding
such trades owing to lower US interest rates,
under downward pressure. At the end of
2009 the dollar was trading at just under
10%, on a weighted average, below its levelExchange rate of the euro

above its low of March 2008. As the financialmarkets calmed down, the pound sterlingalso stabilised in the spring and summermonths of 2009; however, owing to un-favourable economic data and the high con-solidation pressure in the United Kingdom,some of these gains were surrendered as theyear progressed.
Since December 2009, events in the foreign
exchange markets have been crucially shapedby the financial crisis that befell Greece. Gree-ce’s looming financial difficulties and fears ofcontagion to other euro-area countries led inthe spring of 2010 to considerable tension inthe financial markets and caused volatility inthe foreign exchange markets to go back up.The euro was at the centre of all these events.On a weighted average, it depreciated by12

June 2010, recording particularly large lossesagainst the US dollar, the Australian dollar,the Canadian dollar and many east Asian cur-rencies. In early 2010, the US dollar alsobenefited from the announcement of unex-pectedly strong US growth figures for thefinal quarter of 2009 and the expiry of specialmonetary policy measures to supply liquidityto the US financial sector. Towards the middleof 2010, the US dollar was trading around7% higher, on a weighted average, than itslevel at the end of November 2009. Its gainsagainst east European currencies – as well asagainst the euro (+22
1/C252%) – were particularly
strong. The yen likewise rose significantlyagainst the euro (+19
1/C252%) following the out-
break of the debt crisis in Greece; its effectivegains, however, remained relatively low at3%. Despite the difficult budgetary situation
in the United Kingdom, the pound sterlingalso rose perceptibly against the euro(+11
1/C252%) from the end of November. These
gains contrast with other considerable losses,especially against the US dollar; the poundsterling’s effective recovery therefore onlyamounted to 3%.
All in all, the yen and the Swiss franc, in par-
ticular, have thus undergone a particularlysustained shift in their exchange rate relation-ships since the beginning of the financial andeconomic crisis. In effective terms, the yenwas around 42
1/C252% higher and the Swiss
franc around 21% higher in mid-2010 thanat the end of June 2007; they thus also quitedistinctly exceeded their average values overthe 2003-2006 pre-crisis period (20
1/C252% and
15% respectively). The pound sterling under-went equally marked changes – albeit in theopposite direction. It depreciated massivelyduring the financial crisis; at the end of Juneof this year, it was trading at 22% below itslevel three years earlier. Compared with thesesignificant exchange rate effects, the impactof the crisis on the euro and US dollar hasremained muted, on balance. The euro de-preciated by 5% over a three-year periodending in mid-2010, falling to just under itsaverage for the pre-crisis period. At the endof June 2010 the US dollar was trading onlyaround 1
1/C252% below its mid-2007 level but a
perceptible 10% above its 2003-2006 aver-age.

44beginning on page 49. That will be preceded
by a detailed analysis and assessment, using
econometric methods where possible, of the
quantitative importance of various factors
which can be assumed to have played a key
role in exchange rate movements during the
financial crisis. These factors are, specifically,
safe-haven flows, carry trades and the Greek
debt crisis.
Key factors influencing exchange rate
movements during the financial crisis
After the US mortgage crisis had ballooned
into a global financial crisis by the summer of
2008, and the worldwide economic outlook
had accordingly worsened, many observers
noted that the US dollar tended to appreciateupon the announcement of negative eco-
nomic figures on both sides of the Atlantic.
Strikingly, even some negative reports about
the US economy strengthened the dollar. This
trend, which at first glance appears to be
something of a paradox, was repeatedly re-
ported in the press as being the result of port-
folio shifts by international investors who, on
the heels of rising uncertainty in the financial
markets, increasingly “fled” to safe and liquid
assets in the dollar zone.2
Provided that heightened uncertainty in the
financial markets is reflected in a rise in stock
market volatility, a potential relationship be-
tween various bilateral exchange rates to the
US dollar and the implied volatility of the
Standard & Poor’s 500 index can provide an
insight into the role of the US dollar as a
“safe haven” (see box on page 46). If the
change in the exchange rate of the US dollar
to the euro and the pound sterling is re-
gressed on the change in this measure of
uncertainty, one finds that, for the period
starting in July 2008, in which “safe haven”
considerations are alleged to have played an
important role, a statistically significant rela-
tionship does indeed exist. In line with the
“safe haven” hypothesis, a rise in stock mar-
ket volatility is therefore associated with an
appreciation of the US dollar against the euro
and the pound sterling.
Alongside the euro and the pound sterling,
the yen has also been included in the analysis,

45carry trades enables a more complex picture
to emerge.3The mechanism is found to have
the opposite effect for the US dollar-yen rate:as the volatility of the stock markets rises, theUS dollar increasingly comes under pressureto depreciate against the yen. In the yen-USdollar market, the search for safe investmentsis apparently being overcompensated by an-other effect as, before the escalation of thefinancial crisis in the late summer of 2008,international investors had been fundinginvestments in the low-interest-rate yen. Thereduction in the resulting exposure inresponse to the crisis-related market uncer-tainty tended to put the yen under pressureto appreciate. This effect, frequently associ-ated with the unwinding of carry trades, willbe described in more detail in the followingparagraph.
In a currency carry trade, funds are borrowed
in a low-interest-rate currency and investedin a higher-interest-rate currency.
4The open
foreign currency position is intentionally leftunhedged. The yield on a carry trade is thuscomposed of the secure interest rate differen-tial and the insecure, actual exchange ratechange. A carry trade loses money if theinterest rate advantage is overcompensatedby a fall in the high-interest-rate investmentcurrency. However, if uncovered interest par-ity (UIP) is fulfilled (ex post), the interest rategain is exactly offset by a loss from the depre-ciation of the high-interest-rate currency;even in this case, the transaction costs alonewould make a carry trade strategy pointless.Disregarding transaction costs, a carry tradestrategy is always profitable if the exchangerate does not change. Under those condi-tions, the yield on the carry trade corresponds
exactly to the interest rate differential. Bycontrast, if the high-interest-rate currency ap-preciates, the transaction is doubly profitable:firstly, through the interest rate advantage,and secondly, through the appreciation of thehigh-interest-rate currency.
Carry trades could influence exchange rate
movements inasmuch as the exchange offunds borrowed in a low-interest-rate cur-rency into a higher-interest-rate currencyshould tend to strengthen the latter. In add-ition, the observation of a tendency for analready higher-interest-rate currency to ap-preciate can also attract additional investors(herding behaviour). Conversely, the unwind-ing of a carry trade will tend to cause thehigher-interest-rate currency to depreciate,thereby potentially leading more investors towithdraw from the currency in question.
The distinct appreciation of the yen in the
second half of 2008 – especially against thehigh-interest-rate Australian dollar and NewZealand dollar – led many observers to sus-pect that international investors, in responseto the increased volatility in forex markets,
3In C Christiansen, A Ranaldo and P . S/C246derlind (2009),
The time-varying systematic risk of carry trade strategies,

the profitability of currency carry trade falls in times of ris-
ing financial market risk. Against this background, one
may expect that, as uncertainty rises, carry trades will be
unwound and the demand for yen will rise.

nomic literature. See the articles by M Brunnermeier,

The role of the US dollar as a safe haven currency
In order to assess the role of the US dollar as a safe haven cur-
rency, the percentage appreciation of the US dollar against
the euro, the pound sterling and the yen is regressed on the
change in the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index (VIX). The indicator is constructed as the implied vola-
tility of the Standard & Poor’s stock index (30 days) and, as a
measure of global investor risk, is designed to model the
level of global investor uncertainty during the financial crisis.
In order to control for general forex market developments,
the change in the interest rate differential between the cur-
rencies (three-month Euribor and Libor) is considered as a
further regressor. This produces the following estimation
method
/C1st¼/C120þ/C121/C1ðiUS
t/C0i/C3
tÞþ/C122/C1VIX tþut, (1)
where i/C3
trepresents the Euribor or Libor rates of the euro,
pound sterling or yen. The estimation period begins in mid-
July 2008 when the effective exchange rate of the US dollar
swung into an upward trend and uncertainty on the forex
markets increased markedly. The estimation results are sum-
marised in the table below.
While the coefficients /C120and/C121are not statistically signifi-
cant at the 5% level, the exchange rate appears to react
as expected to volatility shocks. The /C122coefficient has a posi-
tive sign for both the euro and the pound sterling and is stat-
istically significant. The development in the value of both
currencies could certainly have been influenced by safe
haven considerations. In the case of the yen, the sign is nega-
tive, however. An increase in risk thus tends to cause the yen
to appreciate against the US dollar. It is possible that thesearch for safe investments is overcompensated by the re-
duction in exposure from carry trades, which are typically
funded using low-interest-rate currencies such as the yen.
This reaction in international portfolios to the uncertainty in
the financial markets caused by the crisis is investigated
below.
The importance of carry trades for exchange rate
developments
The carry trade argument was mentioned in the press, in par-
ticular when describing the evolution of the yen as a funding
currency. However, it was also mentioned on several occa-
sions in discussions regarding high-interest-rate investment
currencies such as the Australian dollar. The following analy-
sis thus takes the following exchange rate relationships as
examples: euro/yen, US dollar/yen, US dollar/Australian dollar
and yen/Australian dollar. First-differencing yields daily per-
centage appreciations and depreciations which are then
compared with the change in the carry-to-risk ratio (CtR), de-
fined as the relationship between the interest differential
and the exchange rate risk.1Under the assumption of static
exchange rate expectations, CtR reflects the expected stand-
ardised return from carry trades and is a risk-adjusted meas-
ure of the superiority of carry trades over other investment
forms.2If carry trades have actually initially brought about
an appreciation of the higher-interest-rate currency against
the lower-interest-rate currency and this process was re-
versed after the onset of the financial crisis, the change in
the exchange rate should be positively correlated with the
change in CtR. In the estimation equation
/C1st¼/C120þ/C121/C1CtR tþ"t (2)
/C121is significantly positive, where /C1strepresents the percent-
age appreciation of the higher-interest-rate currency and
/C1CtR trepresents the change in CtR. The estimation is based
on daily data from the beginning of 2004 to mid-2010. CtR
was calculated using the (3-month) Libor for the yen, US dol-
lar and Australian dollar and the 3-month Euribor for the
euro, and the respective implied volatilities of forex options
with a maturity of three months. Owing to the heteroscedas-
ticity of high-frequency exchange rate data, the Newey-West
correction was used in the ordinary least square estimates.
The results are shown in the table below.
There is a statistically significant /C121coefficient with the ex-
pected positive sign for all currency pairs. An increase in the
interest advantage is thus consistent with appreciation, while
1As described in more detail in the main article, carry trades are not
statistically recorded, meaning that a direct analysis of their influence
is not possible. Instead the article looks at the carry-to-risk ratio (CtR),
which is a measure of the superiority of carry trades and thus can be
regarded as an indicator for the extent of such activities. — 2If theexchange rate risk is disregarded, a positive correlation between the
change in the exchange rate and the change in the interest differen-
tial could also clearly be interpreted as an initial exchange rate reac-
tion (as defined in interest parity theory) which generates the equilib-
rium expected exchange rate changes. — 3On the one hand, higher-Estimation results for the safe haven hypothesis

47an increase in exchange rate risk causes the higher-interest-
rate currency to depreciate. In addition, an R2value of
between 0.05 and 0.21 indicates a, to some extent, high ex-planatory power for daily data. Along with the identificationof an econometric relationship between the two variables,the effects of the financial crisis on carry trade mechanismsare also of interest. The data set was therefore split into twosub-periods for the estimation. As discussed earlier, thechanges in the forex markets as a result of the financial crisisbegan in mid-July 2008. Thus, 15 July 2008 marks the bound-ary in the data set between the pre-crisis and crisis periods.The clear increase in the /C12
1coefficient for all currency rela-
tionships points to an increasing sensitivity of exchange ratesto changes in CtR. This can be reconciled with the observa-tion that the losses in value, for example of the yen againstthe euro between 2004 and mid-2008, were corrected withinhalf a year.
The influence of the Greek debt crisis on the euro exchange
rate
In order to examine the influence of the Greek debt crisis on
the euro, the change in the euro exchange rate against theUS dollar is regressed on the change in the differential be-tween returns on Greek government bonds and GermanFederal bonds. In order to control for general forex marketdevelopments, the VIX mentioned above is considered as afurther regressor. The change in the interest differential be-tween the euro and the US dollar (3-month Euribor/Libor) is
included in the equation as an additional control variableand is used as a proxy for news relevant to the forex market.This produces the following estimation method
/C1st¼/C120þ/C121/C1ðiUS
t/C0iEUR
tÞþ/C122/C1VIX tþ/C123/C1SPREAD tþut, (3)
which is an extension of equation (1).
The estimation is based on daily data from 22 October 2009,
the day on which the newly elected Greek government an-nounced the revised budget deficit, to 9 April 2010, the daybefore the EU/IMF rescue package for Greece was approved.The estimation results are summarised in the table below.
While the /C12
0coefficient is not statistically significant, the ex-
change rate reacts both to changes in the interest rate and,as already shown above, to safe haven flows. The /C12
2coeffi-
cient has the expected sign and is statistically significant. Asignificant influence on the part of Greek government bondspreads is also observable. Under the assumption of linear in-dependent regressors, the /C12
3coefficient can be interpreted
in such a way that the euro records a fall of 0.8% against theUS dollar when the spread increases by one percentagepoint.
3The influence is thus clearly economically significant.4
Estimations over a longer period show, however, that theeffect seems to be fading slowly, particularly after the rescuepackage for Greece in April and after the introduction of theECB’s Securities Market Programme at the beginning ofMay.
5
order lags are statistically insignificant. On the other hand, the equa-
tion was re-estimated without a constant; the result was that the co-efficients remain largely unchanged. — 4The spread has actually in-
creased by 2
3/C254percentage points since 22 October 2009 (as at 9 April
2010), which under the assumptions taken, results in a devaluation ofthe euro against the US dollar by just over 2% (or 3 cent). Overall, the
euro-dollar exchange rate has fallen by 16 cent since 22 October. —5Estimations up to 7 May 2010 show a lower but still significant /C12

48were increasingly unwinding their carry trade
positions. However, the absence of sufficient
data on the behaviour of key agents, such as
hedge funds, makes it difficult to quantify the
effects of these investment strategies on the
exchange rate.5In addition, a variety of in-
struments are used to conduct carry trades,
which is why they are difficult to identify
among international financial transactions –
such as are captured in the balance of pay-
ments.
We will therefore pursue another approach to
identifying the influence of carry trade strat-
egies on observable exchange rate move-
ments. The “carry-to-risk ratio” (CtR), de-
fined as the ratio between the interest rate
differential and exchange rate risk, may serve
as an indicator of the profitability of carry
trades, thereby potentially providing some
insight into the quantitative significance of
carry trades for exchange rate movements. If
it is assumed that, as the profitability in-
creases, the extent of these transactions also
increases, it is possible to analyse empirically
the potential effect of carry trades on ex-
change rate movements (see box on pages
46-47). In fact, the changes in the exchange
rates and CtR for selected currencies do in-
deed turn out to be positively correlated. The
relationship between the two variables appar-
ently intensified following the outbreak of
the financial crisis. The establishment of carry
trade positions and their subsequent unwind-
ing could therefore quite possibly provide an
explanation for exchange rate movements
since the middle of the decade, especially
since the beginning of the financial crisis.The decline in the euro’s exchange rate ob-
servable since December 2009 has been at-
tributed by market watchers to the debt crisis
which emanated from Greece, amongst
other factors. The trigger of the crisis was the
new Greek government’s dramatic upward
revision of the (expected) budget deficit for
2009 on 22 October 2009. Financial market
concerns that Greece might not be able to
roll over expiring debt instruments led to a
sharp increase in risk premiums on Greek
government bonds.
There had already been a perceptible widen-
ing of spreads within the euro area between
October 2008 and March 2009 as the finan-
cial crisis worsened following the collapse of
Lehman Brothers, yet these increases subse-
quently receded. The escalation of the debt
crisis in 2010 then led to an unprecedented
dispersion in euro-area yields, with ten-year
Greek government bonds earning yields that,
at their maximum, reached nearly 13%
(1,000 basis points higher than German fed-
eral bonds with similar maturities).
The impact of these events on the (bilateral)
exchange rates of the euro is the result of
fears that plummeting Greek government
bond values could once again cause severe
difficulties for European banks and destabilise
the financial system. In addition, the high risk
premiums of some euro-area countries that
– in the eyes of market watchers – are facing
similar fiscal challenges are reinforcing the
threat of contagion. All in all, this may have

49led to a certain reticence about investing in
the euro area and may have put a consider-
able strain on the euro.
An empirical study shows that the interest
rate premiums on Greek bonds certainly have
had a systematic influence on the euro-US
dollar exchange rate (see box on page 47). The
euro does indeed fall against the US dollar if
the bond spread described above increases.
Greece’s debt problems have apparently
manifested themselves in a less favourable
“sentiment” towards the euro, even though
this effect appears to have been subsiding of
late.
Real exchange rates and price
competitiveness
The financial crisis has not only caused major
shifts in nominal exchange rates but has also
had a considerable impact on the price com-
petitiveness of many currency areas. Whereas
the shifts have, in some cases, reversed them-
selves in some economies, elsewhere the cor-
rections have become more entrenched. Real
effective exchange rates, which take into
account not only the weighted nominal
exchange rate movements against the cur-
rencies of key trading partners but also the
relevant inflation differentials, are the com-
monly used indicator of price competitive-
ness. The financial crisis and the resultant
recession in many parts of the world led to a
marked decline in goods and asset price infla-
tion; however, it was, above all, the above-
mentioned violent fluctuations in nominalexchange rates which had a major impact on
price competitiveness.
Compared with its long-term average,6the
current competitive position of the United
States is still relatively good despite the recent
appreciation of the US dollar; in mid-2010,
the US economy is faring around 6% better
than its average since 1975. On balance, US
competitiveness has thus fallen only slightly
(by 11/C252%) compared with the beginning of
the crisis in the third quarter of 2007. How-
ever, the indicator was temporarily subject to

50The crisis has left a deeper and more endur-
ing imprint on the Japanese and UK real
effective exchange rates. The current com-
petitive positions of these two countries are
almost on a par with their long-term aver-
ages. However, their starting positions at the
beginning of the crisis could not have been
more different: whereas the Japanese econo-
my’s price competitiveness was far above
average (+221/C252%), the United Kingdom’s
was markedly below its multi-year average
(-18%). The adjustment in Japan was due
mainly to the yen appreciation in the second
half of 2008 outlined above, which was at-
tributable to portfolio shifts by Japanese firms
and households and the unwinding of carry
trades amidst mounting risk aversion. In the
United Kingdom, the slump in the pound trig-
gered by the early collapse in real estateprices and by the UK economy’s heavy de-
pendence on the financial sector shaped
events in the first one-and-a-half years of the
crisis.
Measured against the strong shifts in com-
petitive positions, such as that of Japan and
the United Kingdom, or also against the
temporary volatility of the indicator for the
United States, the euro area’s price competi-
tiveness came away from the crisis relatively
unscathed. Compared with its long-term
average, the euro area’s competitive position
remained weak. Although both the euro de-
preciation in the second half of 2008 and the

indicates that, in the long view, the latest
losses should be seen as a correction of a
previously high valuation level.
In this area, however, major disparities exist
between the individual members of European
Monetary Union (EMU). At the outset of the
crisis, some countries, such as Finland, France
and Germany, already enjoyed a high level of
price competitiveness against a group of 19
countries from both within and outside the
euro area, whereas countries such as Greece,
Portugal, Spain, Italy and Ireland were far less
competitive.7This high dispersion of competi-
tive positions among euro-area countries has
not diminished significantly during the crisis.
According to the indicator, Finland and Ger-
many even managed to become more com-
petitive, whereas Greece’s competitiveness
fell even further.
The development of the euro’s exchange rate
contributed to the relative gain in German
competitiveness. Germany was affected more
strongly by the changes in the euro’s ex-
change rate than most of the rest of the euro
area because, as a large and highly open
economy, it transacts a relatively large share
of its foreign trade with non-euro-area trad-
ing partners. The relatively low rate of infla-
tion in Germany has also tended to be benefi-
cial to the competitiveness of its exportingsector. However, the influence of price com-
petitiveness on the German export sector
should not be overstated – the price compon-
ent has been proving less and less important
for German exporters recently.8
Of all countries in monetary union, Ireland
has seen the largest growth in competitive-
ness since the beginning of the crisis. This is
attributable solely to the perceptibly falling
price levels, as Ireland’s competitiveness had
been put under noticeable strain by the ap-
preciation of the euro against the pound ster-
ling owing to its close trading relations with
the United Kingdom. Conversely, Greece’s
sizeable losses in competitiveness during the
crisis can be explained by the fact that its in-
flation rate is still relatively high.
Measures to restrict exchange rate
flexibility as political response to crisis
The tension in the foreign exchange markets
brought about by the financial and economic
crisis and the asynchronous recovery of the
world economy have provoked exchange rate
policy measures in various countries. Since
the beginning of the crisis, some countries
have constrained exchange rate flexibility by
means of intervention and restrictions on the
free movement of capital. In the following

52paragraphs, developments in China, Iceland
and Switzerland shall serve to illustrate the
broad range of measures taken as well as the
underlying economic policy objectives.
As early as mid-2008, the authorities of the
People’s Republic of China discontinued the
policy they had employed since mid-2005 of
gradually permitting the renminbi to appreci-
ate against the US dollar. Though the renmin-
bi’s exchange rate was still officially oriented
to a currency basket of undisclosed currencies
and weights, in actual fact it had been re-
pegged to the US dollar, albeit without offi-
cial comment. However, China’s trade minis-
try had called for such steps to be taken at
the time, referring to rising costs to exporters.
At that time, the media also reported a con-
nection with the upcoming Peking Olympics,
which the authorities did not want to see
spoiled by negative business news. Although
the crisis may not therefore be regarded as a
direct cause of the exchange rate peg, the
crisis-related increase in pressure on exports
owing to the subsequent global slump in de-
mand is still likely to have played a major role
in the continuation of this measure. In June
2010 the People’s Bank of China once again
started to gradually allow the renminbi to
float while maintaining the formal arrange-
ments of the existing exchange-rate regime.
The financial crisis had an immediate and last-
ing impact on Iceland and its foreign ex-
change market. In the run-up to the crisis, a
rapidly growing financial sector coincided
with enormous stock market gains, soaring
house prices and, at times, a relatively high
inflation rate, which not even double-digitcentral bank lending rates were able to con-
tain for long. The high interest rates initially
favoured capital imports, with which the
country was able to finance the massive
current account deficit. However, when the
three major Icelandic banks encountered
liquidity problems in the wake of the financial
crisis, ultimately requiring their nationalisation
in October 2008, many investors, fearing a
government default, pulled large amounts of
funds out of Iceland. This put massive pres-
sure on the Icelandic krona, which had al-
ready lost more than one-third of its value
against the euro over the course of the year
leading up to October 2008. The Icelandic
central bank initially attempted to break the
krona’s fall by intervening in the foreign ex-
change market. On 10 October, however, the
central bank already introduced extensive for-
eign exchange control measures, including in-
structions to banks to stop using foreign
exchange for financial transactions. This
effectively brought trading in the Icelandic
krona to a halt. Capital controls, which, for
instance, require that securities denominated
in domestic currency which reach maturity be
reinvested in krona and also prohibit earnings
from being exchanged into foreign currency,
are still in force. According to the findings of
the Icelandic central bank,9foreign exchange
controls result in financial institutions and
large enterprises building up their own for-
eign currency reserves. One positive outcome
that is stressed is that the controls have
helped to prevent capital outflows and thus
to stabilise the exchange rate, thereby paving
the way for interest rate cuts. The controls

53were partly loosened in October 2009 to per-
mit capital inflows and the repatriation of theresulting gains.
Switzerland serves as a third example of con-
straints on exchange rate flexibility during thecrisis. Even in the early stages of the crisis, theSwiss franc had already begun to appreciateagainst the euro, a development to which theunwinding of currency carry trades is likely tohave contributed. On 12 March 2009 theSwiss National Bank announced plans toprevent a further appreciation of the francagainst the euro by means of foreign ex-change market interventions. It justifiedits decision by stating that appreciationamounted to a tightening of monetary con-ditions, which was an obstacle to its ex-pansionary monetary policy. By intervening,the Swiss National Bank was attemptingto counteract the risk of deflation and a mas-sive worsening of the economic situation.Even though the details of these operationswere not disclosed, official statements bythe Swiss National Bank have made it perfect-ly clear that the authorities have henceforthrepeatedly sold Swiss franc on the foreignexchange markets; however, these effortswere ultimately unsuccessful in preventingthe appreciation of the Swiss franc. With for-eign reserves now at a considerably higherlevel, however, the Swiss National Bank hasrecently hinted that it intends to discontinueits interventions.
In many emerging market economies, the
calming of the financial markets and the cyc-lical recovery that began in the second quar-ter of 2009 have led to a resurgence of netcapital inflows. The attendant pressure on the
affected currencies to appreciate was seen bymany in these countries as problematic,amidst fears that a worsening of domesticprice competitiveness would threaten thenascent upswing. In addition, concerns aboutspeculative bubbles in the credit markets andin asset prices, as well as about an abruptpullout of capital inflows, were being voiced.Reports of major foreign exchange marketintervention at the expense of the domesticcurrency, especially from the emerging econ-omies of eastern, south-eastern and southernAsia, therefore came as no surprise. In Octo-ber 2009, Brazil introduced a financial trans-action tax on foreign investment in domesticdebt securities and stocks.
Such measures must be viewed against the
background of the monetary policy trilemma,defined as the existence of a trade-off be-tween capital mobility, exchange rate stabilityand monetary autonomy. Foreign exchangemarket intervention and capital controls areused to open up scope to pursue the lattertwo goals. However, since economic recoveryis not sufficiently advanced in many industrialcountries, which leads them to keep theirinterest rates low, the incentives for investingacross borders in emerging market econ-omies will therefore tend to persist, as will,therefore, the pressure to make monetarypolicy concessions.
This has kindled a debate on whether or
not to reassess the merits of capital controls.The International Monetary Fund (IMF), for in-stance, has called into question key elements

54of its previous stance on capital controls.10
The Fund now sees justification for the use of
capital controls in a context of high net cap-
ital imports in two scenarios. One is a situ-
ation where there are macroeconomic consid-
erations which perceptibly constrain latitude
in economic policy; and the other is a situ-
ation in which there is a risk of excessive do-
mestic credit growth, engendering fears that
capital inflows could increase the country’s
vulnerability to a financial crisis.
Indeed, the events during the financial crisis
provide cause for reviewing whether, and to
what degree, existing principles, such as that
of maximum liberalisation of capital move-
ments, are macroeconomically optimal. How-
ever, if they are not, the next question to ask
is whether there was a market failure with re-
gard to international capital allocation, since
capital controls would be an appropriate
policy measure only in that particular situ-
ation. By linking the use of capital controls to
numerous conditions, the new approach of
the IMF is intended to temper the fundamen-
tal recommendation of capital controls with
restrictions to relevant individual cases. This
strategy, however, is of only limited practic-
ability as it is impossible to determine conclu-
sively whether the listed criteria have actually
been met. As a case in point, it is often diffi-
cult to find a general and unequivocal answer
to questions regarding the existence of
undervaluation, the proper amount of foreign
reserve holdings or the possibilities of fiscal
policy consolidation. Fundamental scepticism
regarding the use of capital controls as a
means of fighting capital imports (as opposed
to a case of a genuine crisis) is also engen-dered by the resultant constraints on an effi-
cient global allocation of investment, the
danger of counteractive measures and, most
notably, empirical studies which find that
capital controls are not able to significantly
reduce the volume of capital inflows or to
influence the real exchange rate.11
The renewed debate on the advantages of
capital controls therefore poses the risk that
some countries, citing domestic interests, will
use this discussion to justify interference in
the international exchange rate system. How-
ever, such interference has been limited com-
pared with previous periods of severe global
recession and considerable upheaval in the
financial markets, such as the Great Depres-
sion in the 1930s. Back then, the breakdown
of the gold standard among the industrialised
world led to a series of devaluations, foreign
exchange controls and regimentation of
cross-border movements of goods, which
had a marked adverse impact on global trade
and global growth.
The fact that cases of exchange rate policy
intervention have been relatively isolated dur-
ing the current crisis may certainly be viewed
as a success, inasmuch as economic policy
conflicts which hamper economic recovery

55have thus largely been circumvented. If, how-
ever, a number of countries were to startusing foreign exchange intervention or re-strictions as a policy instrument, there wouldbe no denying the danger that the parochialpursuit of national interests could damagethe international monetary system. Much likeresorting to national protectionism in the realeconomy, this development would entail
long-run costs which would far exceed thesupposed short-run benefits, thereby ad-versely affecting the global economy in gen-eral and the respective countries in particular.One of the lessons from the experience of theGreat Depression in the 1930s is that such adevelopment must be avoided at all costs.

57Deutsche Bundesbank Spring Conference 2010 –
International risk sharing and global imbalances
This year’s Bundesbank Spring Conference on the topic of international risk sharing and global
current account imbalances was clearly shaped by the current financial crisis. The aim of the
Spring Conference was to acquire a better understanding of the extent to which the continuous
growth in international financial market integration as well as global imbalances have played a
role in the current dislocations. Among other things, the papers presented at the conference illus-
trated how the relationship between growing international financial integration and an imperfect
understanding of financial system innovations contributed to the financial crisis. Against this
backdrop, the participants also discussed ways to improve the regulation of the financial systems
that would harness the benefits of international financial market integration and the associated
international sharing of risks while avoiding the danger of intensifying the financial crisis.
Uncertainty is a characteristic feature of financial markets. A key component of this is the need
to make decisions in an uncertain context about future economic developments. New informa-
tion regarding the economic situation can lead to a revision of previous decisions and also trigger
share price fluctuations and wealth adjustments which, in turn, may affect the evolution of
current accounts and might foster turbulence and turmoil on the financial markets.
Other contributors showed that the significance of international financial integration in the cur-
rent crisis can be better understood by more profoundly analysing not only economic cycles but
also their interaction with financial market fluctuations. It became clear that central banks should
play a major role in the ongoing development and application of a regulatory framework for the
international financial system. However, it was also emphasised that central banks’ primary
objective remains to ensure monetary stability and that this should not be jeopardised by other
aims. In addition, the conference sought to promote a deeper understanding of the role of mon-
etary and fiscal policy in overcoming the crisis.

58Introduction
Globalisation and the growing integration of
international financial markets, as well as as-
sociated developments in the national current
accounts, offer significant economic benefits.
An increased level of cross-border financial
market integration allows residents, for ex-
ample, to hold foreign financial assets and to
protect themselves against possible income
risks resulting from country-specific cyclical
fluctuations. Furthermore, residents can accu-
mulate savings in foreign securities if this
appears warranted, say, by demographic
developments in their home country. Hence
greater international financial market integra-
tion fosters the diversification of households’
income risk.
International diversification also allows enter-
prises to spread their profit risk more widely.
It therefore enables firms to concentrate on
specific projects, despite heightened uncer-
tainty regarding their demand, costs and
profits.
Advantages at the corporate level additionally
result from the ability, especially in less
developed countries, to generate certain
types of capital flows (such as foreign direct
investment) and thus productivity gains.
Furthermore, international capital flows can
help the domestic financial sector, particularly
in emerging market economies, to develop
more quickly. Numerous studies have pro-
vided evidence that this fosters more efficient
investment. The current-account develop-
ments that result from the above scenarios
therefore improve the allocation of scarcecapital goods, long-term income prospects
and consequently the repayment capability of
countries receiving capital and thus boost
global welfare.1
Finally, greater integration of international
financial markets is also generally coupled
with the hope of greater discipline and stabil-
ity of a country’s economic policy as large
budget deficits or high inflation rates, for ex-
ample, can be “punished” by international
capital outflows.
However, the financial and economic crisis
has also highlighted the risks and potential
economic costs resulting from globalised and
integrated financial markets as well as from
diverging current account developments. This
has happened before in the aftermath of
monetary and financial crises. For example,
the drawbacks of liberalised capital markets
attracted critical attention following the
Asian crisis at the end of the 1990s. One new
feature of the latest crisis, however, is that it
hit the capital markets and economies of the
industrial countries with full force. The trans-
atlantic contagion effects, which emanated
primarily from the US real estate market,
have had a profound impact worldwide.
Against this backdrop, it is not surprising that
these questions are currently playing a central
role in the academic debate as well. The
Bundesbank therefore dedicated its Spring

59Conference this year to the subject of finan-
cial market integration and current account
imbalances.2
This article summarises the individual papers
that were presented at the conference
grouped around the following central issues.
– How significant were the international
financial system and financial integration
for the current financial crisis?
– What role did global imbalances play in
the current financial crisis?
– What monetary and fiscal policy lessons
can be learned from the international
dimension of the financial crisis?
– How can the international financial sys-
tem be better regulated without sacri-
ficing the benefits of international finan-
cial integration?
The role of financial market integration
in the financial crisis
The presentations of Boz and Mendoza3as
well as Bacchetta, Tille and van Wincoop4
provided new insights into the first issue
regarding the significance of international
financial integration and the financial system
for the current financial crisis.
Both contributions use general equilibrium
models in which investors’ decisions depend
largely on expectations regarding an uncer-
tain future and the world of today is likewiseimperfectly understood. Investors must there-
fore try to learn from new experiences and
information. New information may result in
significant revisions of past decisions which,
in turn, could have far-reaching implications
for the financial markets and also the real sec-
tor of the economy. Decision-making in the
context of uncertainty and incomplete infor-
mation coupled with learning opportunities
also featured prominently in other papers
presented at the conference. This new gener-
ation of theoretical models can explain crises
better than older equilibrium models which
assumed that complete information was
available.
In their paper, Boz and Mendoza analyse the
significance of the new financial products for
the US financial crisis. The authors demon-
strate that insufficient knowledge of the
actual probabilities of default of the new
financial derivatives led to the risk of such
derivatives being underrated. Boz and Men-
doza illustrate how this can lead to overopti-
mism on financial markets. This results in a
partly unconscious tendency among market
players to ignore the economic fundamentals
in their assessments and in excessive borrow-
ing. The subsequent learning process and
corresponding adjustment led to a credit
crunch, a surge in savings and a slump in con-
sumption.

60Bacchetta, Tille and van Wincoop highlight
the impact of poorly capitalised financial insti-
tutions on financial stability by demonstrating
that such institutions can decisively influence
investors’ risk perception of the state of the
financial system. An eroding capital base
of these institutions decreases liquidity and
increases volatility on financial markets.
Furthermore, market participants assess the
likelihood of a financial crisis occurring under
these circumstances as being higher, which
then leads to panic reactions on the financial
markets. It is interesting to note in this
context that a crisis can be explained as an
undesired equilibrium of the modelled econ-
omy rather than, for example, an exogenous
event.
Both of these conference papers suggest that
international financial integration, interacting
with financial system innovations as seen in
recent years, contributed to the current finan-
cial crisis. In particular, an imperfect under-
standing of the nature and features of new
financial instruments and the undercapitali-
sation of banks were key factors in this. An
increase in financial institutions’ capital ratio
and a rise in liquidity requirements, as are
currently being discussed, are possible conse-
quences which can be derived from these
two research papers.
The ability to better assess the role of inter-
national financial integration in the current
crisis additionally necessitates a deeper
understanding of the interaction between
economic cycles and financial market fluctu-
ations. The research work of Claessens, Kose
and Terrones5as well as Kumar, Pavlova andRigobon6has made an important contribu-
tion to this.
Claessens, Kose and Terrones examine the
empirical relationship between cyclical and
financial market developments. The authors
draw on empirical data from a large number
of countries to illustrate in detail how sharp
upswings and downswings in the economic
cycle are accompanied by considerable finan-
cial market fluctuations and share price
swings. Among other things, they confirm
the finding of other studies that cyclical
downturns are often particularly deep and
long whenever problems in the real and
financial sectors coincide.
Kumar, Pavlova and Rigobon focus on the
role of systemic risk in the form of increased
contagion risks in the highly integrated inter-
national financial markets. The authors
develop a structural measure to determine
the size of systemic risk in the global financial
markets. They demonstrate that contagion
risks make a significant contribution towards
explaining the extent of the crisis on the US
housing market. To this end, a deeper under-
standing of how contagion risks originate in
integrated financial markets can help us to
better anticipate the risks of future crises and
to contain them more quickly and effectively.

61The role of current account imbalances
in the financial crisis
The research papers of Fratzscher and
Straub,7Ghironi and Stebunovs8as well as
Hoffmann, Krause and Laubach9provided
new insights into the role of external imbal-
ances in the current financial crisis.
Hoffmann, Krause and Laubach stress the
importance of growth expectations for the
development of global imbalances and show
how revisions to these expectations contrib-
uted to the current financial crisis. They argue
that the less favourable growth expectations
in the USA after 2005 led to substantial ad-
justments in the present value of wealth, a
decline in consumption, investment and the
level of output as well as an improvement in
the current account balance. This abruptly
reversed the pre-crisis process in which
favourable growth expectations had pushed
up the current account deficit. Seen from this
perspective, the current crisis was due in part
to a revision of the present value of wealth,
and the high current account imbalances
were a leading indicator of this development.
This, however, by no means negates the
major role which the international financial
markets played in causing the crisis as inter
alia they failed to promptly signal doubts
regarding overoptimistic growth expect-
ations.
A complementary result is shown in the re-
search work of Ghironis and Stebunovs. Their
findings suggest that financial system innov-
ations can lead to efficiency gains and prod-
uctivity increases and thus promote inter-national capital inflows. The authors show, in
particular, that a more efficient banking sys-
tem facilitates increased business start-ups.
The market entry of new enterprises leads to
a greater demand for labour, higher labour
costs as well as real appreciation and a cur-
rent account deficit. According to this inter-
pretation, the rise in the US current account
deficit in the 1990s was attributable in part
to the deregulation of the banking system in
the United States. The extent to which the
efficiency gains actually translated into sus-
tainable increases in productivity is, however,
to be viewed more critically in retrospect than
at the time when deregulation began.
Fratzscher and Straub likewise emphasise the
importance of expected future productivity
developments for the evolution of the current
account. Variations in the prices of shares and
other financial assets reflect anticipated
changes in a country’s future productivity and
are therefore a good fit for partially explain-
ing the development of the current account.
Thus, here too, there is an explicit corres-
pondence between financial markets and
current account dynamics. The closeness of
this correspondence depends to a large ex-
tent on the degree of international trade and
financial market integration as well as on the
country’s monetary and fiscal policy stances.
Above all in the USA, the current account
corresponds closely with share price develop-
ments.

62Lessons for monetary and fiscal policy,
and the regulation of the international
financial system
The third issue that was discussed at the
Spring Conference relates to the monetary
and fiscal policy lessons that can be learned
from the financial crisis. Expansionary monet-
ary and fiscal policies were adopted world-
wide with a view to stabilising the slumps in
the real economy. In the major currency
areas, the short-term interest rate level fell to
historic lows and discretionary fiscal stabilisa-
tion policies experienced a renaissance. Asso-
ciated issues which are also relevant for polit-
ical decision-makers did not feature promin-
ently on the main agendas of academic dis-
cussion in the past decades. For this reason, a
range of recent studies are devoted to issues
relating to classical stabilisation policy. Cook
and Devereux,10for example, set out to
gauge the size of the fiscal multipliers as well
as the international knock-on effects which
are associated with an expansionary fiscal
policy in a crisis. They show that, compared
with “normal” times, fiscal policy can have
strong demand effects in a country in which
interest rates are close to zero and which is in
a liquidity trap. This is because the interest
and exchange-rate effects that would other-
wise be expected – and which at least partly
counteract the fiscal demand effects – are
only very marginal in this case. Conversely,
other countries, unlike the “normal” case,
benefit little from this expansionary fiscal pol-
icy. One of the main conclusions that can be
drawn from this is that an internationally co-
ordinated monetary and fiscal policy does not
yield any significant welfare gains. Despitethe generally strong domestic effects, how-
ever, it would not be advisable from a welfare
perspective for a government to seek to fully
offset a cyclical output gap.
The research papers from this year’s Spring
Conference reviewed above provided a good
basis for the final question raised at the con-
ference, which moved away from the aca-
demic aspects and more into the policy
sphere of the issue: how can the international
financial system be better regulated without
sacrificing the benefits of international finan-
cial integration, and what role should central
banks play in this? The panel discussion, the
presentation by IMF director Jos/C216 Vi/C230als and
the concluding keynote address from Bundes-
bank President Axel Weber outlined a num-
ber of possible ways forward.
It was stressed that the regulation of the
international financial system needs to focus
on two main aspects. Microprudential regula-
tion at the individual bank level should apply
to the same extent as macroprudential regu-
lation at the level of the financial system as a
whole. In the context of reforming micro-
prudential regulation, it is important that the
current Basel II framework is extended to
incorporate a number of different aspects.
First, greater attention should be given to
stricter capital ratios for financial institutions
and, second, incentives to incur greater risks
should be critically questioned at firm level. A
further aspect of an improved micropruden-
tial regulatory framework includes intro-
ducing new liquidity requirements in order to

63improve banks’ capital quality. This also
involves reassessing the degree of leverageappropriate for banks.
Against the background of these measures,
however, it is also necessary to ensure that theactivities of individual banks on the inter-national capital markets are not too severelyrestricted as to prevent financial institutionsfrom sufficiently benefiting from internationalfinancial market integration, such as beingable to diversify the risk of their customers’portfolios. To this end, it is important to findthe optimal level of financial market regulationin order to internalise the above-mentionedbenefits offered by competitive markets andinternational financial market integration.
The global structure of the international
financial system makes it necessary not just toconsider the regulation of individual banksbut also to strengthen the resilience of theglobal financial system. This implies a need tosubject systemically relevant financial insti-tutions to additional capital requirements.Furthermore, a better financial market infra-structure is required under which systemicallyrelevant banks which run into distress can becaught by a better safety net within thefinancial system, without this jeopardising theentire financial system.When implementing these measures, how-
ever, it is crucial to keep in mind their poten-tial consequences. If the positive welfareeffects of international risk sharing and cur-rent account dynamics in a globalised worldare to be retained, the external impact ofindividual bank regulation on the globalfinancial system has to be taken into account,and vice versa .
Central banks have an important role to play
in the ongoing development and applicationof the regulatory framework and in safe-guarding the stability of financial systems. Indoing so, however, they must not neglecttheir paramount task of ensuring long-termmonetary stability. The orientation of centralbanks towards maintaining price stability isthe central monetary policy achievement ofthe past few decades. Any attempt to subju-gate monetary policy to the aim of financialstability would have an adverse impact on thecredibility of monetary policy in the longterm. Therefore, it is important that a centralbank, as an independent institution, clearlycommunicates and pursues its monetary pol-icy objectives in order to continue to firmlyanchor inflation expectations.
