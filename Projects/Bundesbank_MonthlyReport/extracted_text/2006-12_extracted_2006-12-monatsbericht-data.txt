5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Economy as a wholeGermany’s cyclical upturn continued at a
brisk pace in the third quarter. Overall outputrose by 0.6% after adjustment for seasonaland working-day variations. Growth wastherefore weaker than in the second quarterwhen it had increased by 1.1%. Nevertheless,it should be remembered that favourable spe-cial factors, such as the impact of the FIFAWorld Cup and the weather-related“catching-up” effects in the construction sec-tor, played a significant role in the secondquarter. Year-on-year growth stood at 2.8%in the third quarter after adjustment forworking-day variations. The external sidemade a greater contribution to growth. Ex-ports, for example, were up 4.2% on thequarter during the period under review afterrecording only a slight increase in the secondquarter. Imports rose quite sharply again at3.6%, albeit at a somewhat slower pace thanexports. In mathematical terms, the contribu-tion of foreign trade to overall economicgrowth was 0.4 percentage point. Of particu-lar note was the rise in private consumptionexpenditure, which increased by 0.7% afterhaving gone down somewhat in the secondquarter. Investment in machinery and equip-ment went up by 0.7% in the third quarter.Construction investment also developed ina similar fashion. By contrast, inventorychanges had a dampening effect.GDP in

Industrial output in October was down 11/C254%
on the month in seasonally and working-day
adjusted terms and 1% down on the averageof the third quarter. At the end of the periodunder review, the figure was 4% up on theyear, compared with 6% in September. Here,the “bridge day” effect in connection withthe public holiday on 3 October is likely tohave significantly depressed output.

This also makes it difficult to assess the cur-rent underlying cyclical trend in industry asanticipatory effects owing to the VAT increaseat the beginning of next year are likely tohave had an impact on output in some sec-tors over the past three months. This couldwell have been the case for manufacturers ofmotor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers, forexample, whose output has declined signifi-cantly at the current end after recording asharp increase in the third quarter.
At the same time, there were, at all events,
fewer new orders being placed with manu-facturers of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers, while the number of new passengercar registrations rose extremely sharply in No-vember. On the whole, these observations arequite consistent with the widely expected an-ticipatory effects in the second half of 2006in connection with the VAT increase and thematching shortfalls in demand at the begin-ning of next year. This is due to the fact that,Economic conditions in Germany*

7when buying a car, VAT is calculated on the
basis of the rate applying on the delivery daterather than on the basis of the rate of taxthat applies on the date when the order isplaced. Demand for industrial products wasobviously shaped by these effects and wentdown by 1% in October. Much as in the caseof output, the figure was still clearly up onthe year.
The value of exports of goods in October rose
by 2
1/C252% on the month. Once again, how-
ever, this figure was influenced by late statis-tical reporting. By contrast, nominal importsjust about held up. In October, the trade sur-plus was 32 billion higher than in September.
ConstructionSeasonally and working-day adjusted con-
struction output declined by 2
1/C254% in Octo-
ber. This figure was still 3% up on the year,however. The slowdown in the building in-dustry was greater than in civil engineering.This may be due to the intervening comple-tion of many of the increased number ofhousing construction orders which had beeninfluenced by the abolition of the grant tohomebuyers at the end of 2005 as well as theforthcoming VAT increase.
In line with this, demand for construction
work in September, at 3
1/C252%, showed a fur-
ther quite marked fall. In the third quarter asa whole, construction demand did not quitematch the improved level achieved in thesecond quarter. While there was a
3/C254% rise in
orders in the third quarter in both housingconstruction and commercial construction,public sector orders were 2
1/C254% down on the
second quarter. Demand for constructionwork has therefore been at a high level sincethe middle of the year, but there have notbeen any further stimuli since then.
Labour marketThe favourable development in the labour
market has continued. According to initial es-timates by the Federal Statistical Office, thenumber of persons in work stood at 39.19million in October. This was 25,000 morethan in September and 345,000 more thanone year earlier. The increase has thereforeslowed down somewhat since the middle ofthe year. It should also be borne in mind,however, that the increase in the flat-ratecharges for mini-jobs from 25% to 30% inJuly has been tending to have a dampeningimpact on the growth in employment. Ac-cording to estimates by the Federal Employ-ment Agency, the number of employees sub-ject to social security contributions showed afurther increase on the month in September.In the third quarter as a whole, the figure was140,000 up on the second quarter and250,000 up on the year. The number of jobvacancies also increased substantially in Octo-ber. By contrast, there was little change ingovernment-assisted forms of employment.
According to Federal Employment Agency
data, the number of persons registered as un-employed fell sharply in November. The offi-cial seasonally adjusted unemployment figurewas 4.25 million. The figure was thus535,000 lower than in the same period lastyear. The seasonally adjusted unemployment Foreign trade

8rate was 10.2%, compared with 10.4% in
October.
PricesThe price situation in the international crude
oil markets remained calm in November. Atjust over US$60
1/C254, the spot quotation for
Brent North Sea oil in mid-month was virtual-ly at the same level as in October. At the timethis report went to press (14 December2006), the spot price stood at just overUS$63. Futures contracts with maturities ofsix months were up US$4
1/C254on the month
and up by as much as US$7 if taken over an18-month period.
Owing to the calming in the crude oil mar-
kets, price pressures eased considerably in thedownstream sectors of the economy. Importprices, for example, were somewhat lowerthan in the previous month. The year-on-yearrate of increase fell from 3.7% to 3.0%. InOctober, industrial producer prices were4.6% up on the year. The rate of increase inSeptember had been as much as 5.1%. Ex-cluding the decline in energy prices, the up-ward pressure on prices has intensified some-what, however.
Seasonally adjusted consumer prices in No-
vember were 0.1% up on the month. Therewas a further fall in the prices of fuel andheating oil, and package holidays also be-came somewhat cheaper again. However,food prices went up again and the prices ofindustrial products (excluding energy) con-tinued to rise. Seasonally adjusted prices ofservices also rose relatively sharply. The extentto which price adjustments have alreadytaken place in anticipation of the increase inVAT at the beginning of 2007 will need to beanalysed in detailed studies. Owing in part toa base effect due to the sharp fall in energyprices in November 2005, year-on-year con-sumer price inflation (CPI) went up from1.1% in October to 1.5% in the followingmonth. Measured by the Harmonised Indexof Consumer Prices (HICP), the inflation ratestood at 1.5%.

Updated stability programme
On 29 November 2006, the Federal Cabinet
endorsed an updated stability programme,which – as an integral part of the Europeanexcessive deficit procedure – was sent to theEU Council and the European Commission. Inthe updated programme, the Federal Govern-ment proceeds on the assumption of a realeconomic growth rate of 2
1/C254% in the current
year and of almost 11/C252% next year (compared
with just under 11/C252% and 1% respectively in
the previous programme from February). Theoutput gap in 2006 is considered to be virtu-ally closed and potential growth – boosted byincreasing investment in real and human cap-ital – is expected to rise to 1
1/C252% in the me-
dium term. In the basic scenario, however,production in 2010 is significantly higher

9than its medium-term trend. Thus, the as-
sumption is that real gross domestic product(GDP) will increase by 1
3/C254% per year from
2008 to 2010.
The projected general government budget
deficits are significantly lower than foreseenin February’s stability programme, mainly dueto expectations of a more favourable macro-economic trend and the current unexpectedlysharp increase in revenue from profit-relatedtaxes. A deficit ratio of 2.1% is now envis-aged for the current year, with the result thatthe Maastricht Treaty reference value will bemet for the first time since 2001. Applyingthe standard adjustment procedures, underwhich the extremely strong growth in rev-enue from profit-related taxes is classifiedonly to a very limited extent as cyclically in-duced, only a minor part of the year-on-year
decrease of 1.1 percentage points is attrib-uted to economic activity. Despite the meas-ures taken by the Federal Government,which, on balance, are explicitly classified asvirtually budget-neutral, structural consolida-tion of around three quarters of a percentagepoint is recorded.
3In 2007, both the un-
adjusted deficit ratio and the structural deficitratio are expected to decrease further to1
1/C252%, owing mainly to the increase in the
standard rate of VAT. This should constitutestructural consolidation of 1
1/C254% of GDP vis-
/C224-vis 2005 and means that the targets set bythe Ecofin Council will be met.Key data of the Federal Government’s updated stability programme

10While remaining below the 3% ceiling this
year and the planned compliance with Euro-pean provisions in 2007 are circumstances tobe welcomed, the envisaged deficit reductionfrom 2008 onwards is not sufficiently ambi-tious. The business tax reform planned for2008, which is aimed, in particular, at makingGermany a more attractive business and in-vestment location, will lead to revenue short-falls. Consequently, the deficit ratio is expect-ed to remain initially at 1
1/C252% and to fall by
only half a percentage point in each of thefollowing two years. Despite the anticipatedabove-average growth in real GDP , in struc-tural terms the Federal Government envisagesa general government deficit of around 1%of GDP in 2010. Thus, even in the final yearof the forecast period, there is no attempt tofulfil the aim set down in the Stability andGrowth Pact of achieving at least a close-to-balance budget. In the entire three-yearperiod from 2008 to 2010, the structural def-icit ratio is set to fall by only half a percentagepoint in total. Thus, throughout the forecastperiod, structural consolidation is equivalentto an annual average rate of less than 0.5%of GDP . This runs counter to another of themain targets of the revised Stability andGrowth Pact, whose reform was aimed pre-cisely at increasing consolidation in goodtimes. As recently as November, the FinancialPlanning Council also explicitly expressedunanimous support for annual structural con-solidation of 0.5% of GDP beyond 2007. Notleast the developments at the beginning ofthis decade have demonstrated how quicklyan excessive deficit can arise when economicgrowth slackens significantly and no provi-sions have been made in good times. For thisreason, it would seem appropriate to pursuemore ambitious medium-term aims in the fu-ture. It is now a question of determinedly re-sisting the temptation to increase debt that islikely to arise as a result of the favourable def-icit trend. New fiscal “good deeds” wouldrun counter to the aim of a sustainable con-solidation of public finances.

Statutory health insurance
In the third quarter of 2006, the statutory
health insurance fund recorded a deficit of3
1/C254billion, which was only marginally higher
than in the same period last year. Contribu-tion receipts were up by almost 1
1/C252% on the
year. Almost half of the increase in contribu-tion receipts was attributable to the rise inthe average contribution rate by 0.1 percent-age point to just under 14.3% at the end ofthe period under review. Income subject tocompulsory insurance (basic wage total) grewby almost
3/C254%. Overall revenue was up by
just under 2% on the year.
With an increase of 2%, expenditure grew
only marginally faster than revenue. Whilegrowth rates in expenditure on both hospitaland out-patient treatment were particularlystrong (3
1/C252%), in the case of pharmaceuticals
spending actually decreased by 2%. Growthin expenditure was apparently dampened atleast temporarily by the Act improving cost-efficiency in pharmaceuticals supply ( Gesetz

11Arzneimittelversorgung ) which came into
force on 1 May 2006. Spending on dentaltreatment also fell by 4% and growth in ex-penditure on dentures was low at just under1%. Expenditure on sickness benefits de-creased by a further 2
1/C252%.
Thus, the negative balance in the first nine
months also came to 31/C254billion. However,
the second instalment of the Federal grant,totalling 34.2 billion (compared with 32.5 bil-
lion last year), will not be transferred until thefourth quarter. This, combined with the in-crease in contribution receipts owing toChristmas bonuses, means that a substantialsurplus is to be expected for the fourth quar-ter and for the year as a whole.
For the coming year, the cut in the Federal
grant has been reduced by 32.7 billion to
31.7 billion, meaning that 32.5 billion will still
be transferred. However, this, in combinationwith the additional expenditure arising fromthe increase in VAT (almost 31 billion) alone
will require an increase in the average contri-bution rate by almost 0.3 percentage point.Moreover, the statutory health insurance in-stitutions are, as a rule, required to repaytheir debt by the end of 2007.
5The measures
with short-term effects envisaged as part ofthe health system reform are designed tobring in savings of 31.4 billion as early as
2007. However, it is doubtful whether thiswill be successful, as the measures in ques-tion are mainly regulations governing the re-lationship between health insurance institu-tions and service providers, the effects ofwhich will depend on the reactions of theparties involved, which can only be predictedto a certain extent. Furthermore, an extension
of the benefits offered is also planned. In add-ition, in the course of the legislative process,further financial burdens on health insuranceinstitutions could arise.
Statutory long-term care insurance
scheme
There was a marginal deficit in the statutory
long-term care insurance scheme in the thirdquarter of 2006. The surplus of just under 3
1/C252
billion in the first half of the year was solely
attributable to the fact that the transfer datesfor social security contributions had beenQuarterly

12brought forward. In contrast to the statutory
health insurance scheme, the quarterly finan-cial statistics for the long-term care insurancescheme are based on an income-expenditurecalculation without an accruals-based classifi-cation. As in the case of pension and un-employment insurance, as a result of a transi-tional regulation this lead to a temporary in-crease in income in the months up to and in-cluding July. However, as in the health insur-ance scheme, the contributions will be allo-cated to the underlying fees on an accrualsbasis in the final annual accounts. These ac-counts will therefore record a deficit ratherthan a surplus for the first nine months of theyear. On the expenditure side, there was acontinued shift away from nursing benefit to-wards non-financial benefits (in particular, in-patient nursing care).Securities markets
Bond marketIssuing activity in the German bond market
was again very buoyant in October. Debtsecurites were sold for a total of 391.8 billion,
compared with 3101.2 billion in the previous
month. After deducting redemptions andaccounting for changes in issuers’ holdings oftheir own bonds and notes, the volume ofdomestic bonds outstanding increased by323.1 billion. In addition, 318.2 billion worth
of foreign bonds were sold in Germany, mostof which consisted of euro-denominatedpaper. Sales of German and foreign bonds inthe month under review raised funds totalling341.3 billion.
In October, general government increased itscapital market debt by 314.2 billion following
very limited recourse to the market inSeptember. Central government borrowingaccounted for 313.7 billion of this, with sales
of two-year Federal Treasury notes in theamount of 35.5 billion, five-year federal
notes (Bobls) to the value of 35.3 billion and
a limited quantity of ten-year Bunds ( 32.3 bil-
lion) as well as some Treasury discount paper(Bubills) and Federal Treasury financing paper.On balance, state governments issued 30.6
billion worth of bonds and notes.
During the month under review, banks raised
38.7 billion from the sale of their own bonds.
Specialised credit institutions issued debtsecurities worth 36.6 billion net. Other bank
debt securities, which can be structured flex-ibly, were sold for 34.3 billion. In addition,Quarterly

worth of public Pfandbriefe while the out-standing amount of mortgage Pfandbriefewas reduced by 34.4 billion.
In October, non-financial corporations were
hardly present as issuers on the German bondmarket. They redeemed 30.3 billion worth
net of longer-term corporate bonds andissued 30.4 billion worth of short-term com-
mercial paper.
On the buyers’ side, domestic credit institu-
tions and foreign investors were the mainpurchasers of debt securities in October.Banks acquired bonds worth 314.7 billion,
these consisting exclusively of foreign paperon balance. Issues of German private andpublic sector borrowers were mainly acquiredby foreign investors ( 318.3 billion). By con-
trast, bond market investment by Germannon-banks was on a limited scale ( 38.3 bil-
lion). They mostly bought public sector secur-ities ( 35.2 billion) and, to a lesser, extent
private sector paper ( 31.4 billion) along with
foreign debt securities ( 31.8 billion).
Equity marketIssuing activity in the German equity market
was very subdued in October. Listed enter-prises placed new shares with a market valueof30.2 billion, compared with a figure of
30.7 billion in September. Furthermore, sales
of foreign equities in cross-border portfolioinvestment raised 30.9 billion net. On bal-
ance, German shares were purchased solelyby foreign investors ( 36.6 billion), whereas
German investors disposed of equities in theamount of 37.3 billion. Above all, German
non-banks reduced their equity investments(-35.7 billion). In parallel with this, banks also
lowered their stock market exposure some-what (- 31.6 billion).
Mutual fund sharesIn October, domestic mutual funds recorded
net outflows of 31.3 billion. Funds open to
the public remained the most affected (- 30.8
billion), as were the specialised funds reservedfor institutional investors, albeit to a smallerextent (- 30.5 billion). Of the funds open to
the public, both bond-based and share-basedfunds had to accept return flows of mutualfund shares . At the same time, open-end realestate funds, which in the last two years hadbeen faced with large outflows of funds,Sales and purchases

The German current account recorded a sur-

with 39.7 billion in the previous month. An
increase in the trade surplus and a slightlylower deficit on invisible current transactions,which comprise services, income and currenttransfers, contributed to the rise.
According to provisional figures from the Fed-

15enced by late reports. By contrast, the value
of imports of goods fell in October (-1/C254%).
The fall can be attributed mainly to lower oilprices and the fact that the euro tended toappreciate. Nevertheless, in the last threemonths, imports exceeded the figure for theprevious period by 4
3/C254%.
The deficit on invisible current transactions
went down by 30.4 billion on the month to
33.9 billion in October. The main reason for
this was that the deficit on services decreasedby31.2 billion to 32.2 billion. However, net
receipts from cross-border income fell by 30.6
billion to 31.1 billion. In addition, the deficit
on current transfers went up by 30.2 billion
to32.9 billion.
There were net capital imports amounting to
36.5 billion resulting from cross-border port-
folio investment in October, after large capitaloutflows in the previous month ( 316.4 bil-
lion). The main reason for the reversal wasa surge in portfolio investment by non-residents in Germany to 323.2 billion (com-
pared with 34.4 billion in September). In
particular, they increased their demand forGerman debt securities ( 318.3 billion), buying
both bonds ( 313.8 billion) and money market
paper ( 34.4 billion); furthermore, they invest-
ed35.3 billion in the German stock market.
However, residents invested in foreign secur-ities to much the same extent as in September(316.7 billion, compared with 320.9 billion).
They mostly acquired debt securities, whereasthey sold foreign shares ( 32.2 billion).In contrast to portfolio investment, direct in-
vestment resulted in outflows of funds ( 34.3
billion net). These can be attributed to capitalexports by German firms ( 35.8 billion), which
provided their foreign affiliates with bothadditional capital and loans. Foreign enter-prises marginally increased their investmentin Germany ( 31.5 billion). Although they
topped up their equity capital in Germanysomewhat more heavily, domestic subsidiariesof foreign firms repaid group loans whichthey had previously raised from their foreignparent companies.
Other investment, which comprises loans and
trade credits as well as bank deposits andother assets, resulted in net outflows in Octo-ber ( 32.9 billion). Both the activities of gen-
eral government and those of enterprises andhouseholds led to net capital exports ( 36.4
billion and 34.9 billion, respectively). Both
sectors invested liquid funds in bank accountsabroad. By contrast, the non-securitisedcredit transactions of the banking system,which may be seen as the counterpart to theother cross-border payments, resulted in netinflows of funds ( 38.3 billion). The funds
accruing to the Bundesbank ( 34.9 billion)
were attributable mainly to a reduction inclaims within the large-value payment systemTARGET.

17Germany in the
globalisation processOver the past 15 years, Germany’s in-
creasing participation in the inter-national division of labour has takenplace against the backdrop of an espe-cially dynamic globalisation process.Technical progress and the tendencytowards decreasing communicationand transport costs have encouragedthe rapid integration of the worldeconomy. In the early 1990s, globalisa-tion received an additional boost fromthe integration of formerly non-market-oriented economies into theinternational division of labour. In add-ition to the central and east Europeancountries, China is most notably con-tributing to corresponding changes.German enterprises have used the newopportunities to improve their com-petitiveness. This is apparent not leastfrom the dynamic growth in Germanexports. In spite of the emergence ofnew competitors, German industry hasbeen able, for the most part, to main-tain its export market shares over thepast few years. In the long term, how-ever, taking advantage of globalisationand limiting the inevitable adjustmentcosts requires a willingness to makestructural change and reforms in Ger-many. This report analyses differentfacets of the globalisation process andlooks at the factors determining Ger-many’s position in the world market.

18Indicators of Germany’s increasing
integration into the world economy
The internationalisation of economic life,
which accompanies the rapidly advancingglobalisation process, is reflected in the sharpincrease in cross-border activities in the goodsand capital markets, among other things.This development can be seen, for example,in the fact that world trade has been growingfaster in past decades than worldwide eco-nomic output. During the past 20 years,world trade has increased 1
1/C252times as much
as global gross domestic product (GDP). Inthe 1990s, world trade grew at an annualaverage of 6
1/C252%, which was actually twice as
fast as real economic output. More and moregoods and services are becoming tradable. Atthe same time, companies and economieshave become more involved in foreign trade.Accordingly, the degree of real economicopenness of many countries – total exportsand imports of goods and services as a ratioof GDP – has increased significantly. This ratiohas also noticeably increased in Germany. Forinstance, the real economic transaction vol-ume with foreign countries increased fromjust over 60% of GDP in 1990
1to over 75%
last year. This is a high value for a relativelylarge industrial country in terms of GDP andshows Germany to be a very open economy.The corresponding figure for the USA and forJapan in 2005 was 27% in both cases.
Cross-border trade in goods, in particular, is
shaping Germany’s high degree of real eco-nomic openness. About 83% of German for-eign trade transactions are determined bytrade in goods. Although the cross-border ex-change of services has markedly increasedover the past few years, in line with a world-wide trend it has not increased any morethan the trade in goods. Even so, the struc-ture of the German services account reflectschanges in international service transactions.Thus, in addition to the traditionally signifi-cant travel and transport segments, it is main-ly technological services that are gainingground. In 2005, they accounted for 20% ofGerman revenue and for almost 15% of Ger-man expenditure in the services sector. Thecorresponding shares in 1990 had been 10%and 9%, respectively.
2
The momentum in foreign trade is also a signof the internationalisation of production andenterprises. This is accompanied by a world-wide increase in cross-border direct invest-ment stocks. Various studies show that thereis a complementary relationship between acountry’s foreign trade development and itsdirect investment.
3The globalisation of enter-
prises has therefore become a dominant fac-tor in the world’s economic integration. Atthe same time, from an enterprise’s point ofview, it is often the global perspective that isnow of major importance for decisions on de-velopment, production and sales. Accordingto UNCTAD figures, worldwide foreign directinvestment (FDI) stocks amounted to over
1Western Germany.
2The figures refer to services in the areas of patents and
licences, research and development, engineering and
other technical services, as well as IT services.

19US$10 trillion in 2005. About 77,000 trans-
national enterprises with about 770,000branches are involved. Their importance forthe world economy is significant, and this canbe seen not least in the fact that an estimated62 million people were employed in thesebranches in 2005. Germany’s outward directinvestment constituted 9% of worldwide FDIstocks while Germany’s inward direct invest-ment constituted 5% of worldwide FDIstocks.
4
Many German enterprises focus on strength-ening their competitive position and openingup new markets by means of an investmentabroad.
5For 2004, the Bundesbank’s Micro-
database Direct investment (MiDi) showsabout 22,700 German branches abroad andabout 9,000 branches of foreign enterprisesin Germany. The cross-border investmentboth of German enterprises abroad and offoreign enterprises in Germany has increasedconsiderably over the past few years. Since1990, the statistically recorded direct invest-ment stocks of German enterprises abroadhave risen by a multiple of 6
1/C252, which is
somewhat more than the worldwide in-crease. In the opposite direction, growth wasweaker: the FDI stocks in Germany in 2004were only four times as great as their value in1990.
6
Not only the increase but also the structure ofworldwide FDI stocks reflect the globalisationprocess and the changes in the worldwidedivision of labour. In 1990, for example, 80%of worldwide FDI stocks were concentratedon industrial countries. In 2005, the corres-ponding share was 70%. Since the early1990s, developing countries have been at-
tracting substantial foreign capital. However,this investment has been concentrated onjust a few countries, mainly in Asia. China, inparticular, has become one of the preferredlocations for foreign direct investment inrecent years. This seems to be mainly a reflec-tion of the direct investment motives of pro-duction cost savings and market access. Inrecent years, however, Asia has also beengaining increasing importance as a directinvestment capital supplier.
7Apart from Asia,
the central and east European countries havebeen noticeably integrated into the inter-nationalisation of production by means ofdirect investment since the early 1990s.
With regard to German enterprises’ invest-
ment abroad, it becomes evident that firstand foremost a greater investment in thenew central European EU member states aswell as in the USA has changed the regionalbreakdown. In the accession countries, theshare of German outward direct investmentrose from virtually zero in 1990 to 6% of latewhile, in the USA, it rose from 23% to 33%in the same period. By contrast, the sharp in-crease in direct investment (in terms ofgrowth rates) that has also occurred in the
4See UNCTAD, World Investment Report 2006. Inter-
national comparisons of direct investment figures are
partly complicated by the fact that country data do not
always have the same valuation basis. For example, Ger-
man data are specified at book value whereas some
other countries record stock statistics at market value.

China over the past 15 years has not caused
these countries’ share of overall Germaninvestment to rise significantly (2% and 1%,respectively).

The change in the worldwide direct invest-ment structure is also revealing when brokendown by sector. For example, the importanceof direct investment in the services sector hasincreased in recent years. While this sector ac-counted for only about one-quarter of world-wide FDI stocks in the early 1970s, the corres-ponding share in 2002 was some 60%.
10This
may be due not least to the fact that, in theservices sector, the opportunities created bytechnical progress and decreasing costs in thecommunication sector are of great import-ance. A policy of market-opening in manycountries also played a part. In terms ofamount, German direct investment is also fo-cused on the services sector, which recently(2004) was the focus for about 70% of in-vestment. Financial services, in particular,played an important role in this.
In other words, enterprises are increasingly
making use of the opportunities created bythe globalisation process by taking the globalperspective into consideration when makingdecisions on production and organisation inthe services sector. Just as the goods marketshave been subject to increasingly intenseinternational competitive pressure, the ser-vices sector in industrial countries is now alsofacing more and more international competi-tion.The process of increasing global integration isespecially discernible in the financial markets.More and more countries have access to theinternational capital market. At the sametime, there has been a sharp rise in the vol-ume of cross-border securities transactions inrecent years. In the case of Germany, for ex-ample, the turnover in portfolio investmentwith non-residents in 2005 was just over570% of GDP – ten times as much as in1990. In the USA, the corresponding ratio in2005 was just under 330%.
Other factors, such as the close coupling of
interest rates for long-term bonds or thegrowing international correlation of shareprices, also provide evidence of the rapidlyadvancing financial market integration.
11Fur-
ther evidence is found in the sharp rise in thedegree of financial openness of many econ-omies. This degree of openness representsthe ratio of the sum of external assets and li-abilities to GDP . For Germany, it amounted tojust over 340% in 2005, which was threetimes as high as in 1990. In the USA the cor-responding indicator increased in this periodby 116 percentage points to just under 200%

The scope and the pace at which the integra-
tion of the goods and capital markets has ad-vanced in recent years were also accompan-ied by a globalisation change. After theSecond World War, the integration of thewestern industrial countries, in particular, ad-vanced rapidly. In the meantime, the global-isation process also covers most developingcountries and emerging market economies,whose degree of openness is often higherthan that of the leading industrial countries.
12
This changes the challenges of the growingeconomic interdependence for an industrialcountry such as Germany. The degree towhich a country can benefit from the oppor-tunities of open markets is mainly determinedby domestically influenced factors. In thisconnection, structural change and accom-panying structural reforms play a central role.Not only do they contribute towardsstrengthening the relative position of aneconomy in the international economic struc-ture, they also are essential from a domesticperspective, especially for Germany.

22means of offshoring, ie undertaking parts of
the production abroad either in an enterpri-se’s own branches or by means of foreignnon-affiliated companies.
13This makes it pos-
sible to separate human or fixed-capital-intensive areas, such as administration,research or final assembly, from the oftenlabour-intensive production of individual sub-components. The growing importance of this“fragmentation” can be seen in the fact thatnot only finished products but increasinglymore intermediate goods are traded betweencountries.
14
In contrast to the aforementioned inter-industrial trade in various goods, the intra-industrial trade in goods within a sector doesnot depend primarily on the exploitation ofcomparative cost advantages but mainly onthe existence of economies of scale, ie theadvantages of mass production. Such coststructures are typically due to a large block offixed costs, owing to the intensive use offixed capital or technical knowledge. Econ-omies of scope that result from the size of anetwork and play a great role in telecommu-nication, for example, have a similar effect. Inboth cases, foreign trade allows not only fall-ing average production costs but also a great-er product variety.
15Ultimately, both is bene-
ficial to consumers.
The direct advantages of the international
division of labour are supplemented by indir-ect earnings, which often may be difficult toquantify but undoubtedly play an importantrole in the long term. At enterprise level, thedynamic effects of intensified competitionand of an accelerated dissemination of tech-nical knowledge are particularly worth men-tioning. Moreover, economic policy makerssee themselves exposed to greater competi-tion between the systems and are driven tostricter fiscal discipline, for example.
According to estimates by the European
Commission, one-fifth of the rise in thestandard of living in the EU countries over thepast 50 years is due to the greater opennessof the world economy.
16However, globalisa-
tion also increases the individual economicneed for adjustment and accelerates macro-economic structural change. Individual sec-tions of the population and economic sectorsmay be affected quite differently by this. Ne-cessary adjustments are signalised by shifts inthe relative prices of goods and in relative in-come. For example, an additional supply ofproduction factors, goods or services at firstgenerally signifies an intensification of compe-tition and a deterioration in the income situ-ation of the existing providers whereas add-itional foreign demand tends to have positiveeffects on income.

23tensified trade links between Germany and
China are a case in point: the low prices fortextiles from the Far East increased the com-petitive pressure on producers in Germany(and in other European countries). From 2000to 2005 alone, German imports of textilesand clothing from China increased by 90%,and the production in Germany dropped byalmost 25%. By contrast, German mechanicalengineering enterprises almost tripled theirsales in China in the same period.
Globalisation and labour market
The adjustments in the labour markets which
are linked to globalisation are an especially sen-sitive issue in social politics. In industrial coun-tries such as Germany, which is considered a“high-wage country” by international stand-ards, the globalisation process and the associ-ated need for adjustment are often seen as athreat to jobs, wages and working conditions.
It is true that the conditions in the inter-
national labour market have changed verydramatically and very rapidly over the pastfew years. China and India alone each boasta population of over 1 billion. In the mean-time, the factor labour has become muchmore available to enterprises operatingworldwide than 20 years ago. The wage dif-ferences on the global labour market are con-siderable. However, this reflects not only dif-ferences in factor endowments, productivityand “quality”, in the sense of training andperformance, but also significant differencesin living standards and in social welfare.Wage differences alone, however, say noth-ing about the advantages of individual loca-tions. For an industrial country such as Ger-many, the question still remains as to whichadjustments and challenges accompany theglobalisation process.
Real foreign trade theory makes it possible to
describe potential effects of a change in inter-national factor endowments – as observed inrecent years – on the structural change andlabour markets in the industrial countries. Toa certain extent, the worldwide growth in thesupply of low-priced and comparatively la-bour-intensive goods and services fore-shadows a structural change in industrialcountries at the expense of the sectors com-peting with imports, especially since capitalmovements in the form of direct investment,for example, also contribute to this.

24The increasing availability of low-paid work
can contribute to rising wage differences inthe industrial countries.
17However, un-
employment may also arise in countrieswhere wages do not react flexibly enough.
18
Especially in the case of poorly qualifiedworkers in industrial countries, there is thedanger that the wages paid exceed theirproductivity and that a downward wage ad-justment is prevented by explicit or implicitminimum wages. These jobs then cannotwithstand the competition. A comparison ofunemployment among poorly qualified per-sons in OECD countries indicates, for ex-ample, that Germany has been less successfulthan some other countries in integrating per-sons with only low qualifications into thework process. In Germany, the correspondingunemployment rate in 2004 was 20.5%,which was just over 7 percentage pointshigher than ten years earlier. In the OECDaverage and in the EU average, however, itremained virtually constant during the sameperiod; in 2004, it was 10.4% and 12.9%, re-spectively.
19However, various studies show
that other factors, such as technical progressand corresponding changes in qualificationrequirements, dominate employment in theindustrial countries more than the effects ofthe international division of labour.
20
The empirical evidence for the effects of glob-alisation on the labour markets of industrialcountries is not conclusive. In view of thepartly contrasting effects over different hori-zons, this finding is not surprising. Thus,negative consequences for individual sectorsand groups of persons may well be expectedin the short and medium term. However,these costs in the transition phase are setagainst the advantages arising in the longterm. First, jobs that are lost tend to be re-placed by higher-grade jobs with better in-come prospects. Second, less productive jobscan also benefit in the long term from a gen-erally rising income level. A current study bythe European Commission is simulating theseeffects for the EU countries and concludesthat the costs of the adjustment period arerelatively low compared with the possiblelong-term gains.
21The simulation also shows
that protectionist measures would result in asubstantial long-term downturn in the in-come level in the EU. By contrast, economicpolicy reforms can facilitate the adjustmentprocesses. They make it possible to exploitpotential advantages of globalisation moreeffectively and would significantly improvethe EU countries’ income prospects. In thiscontext, the institutional framework in the la-bour market also plays a central role in influ-encing the effects of the structural change onemployment and unemployment.

25In Germany, too, the flexibility of wages or of
the wage structure is an important determin-ant of the labour market effects which stemfrom the growing international division of la-bour and the necessary adjustment to thechanges of the worldwide factor endow-ments. Against this background, the partialflexibilisation in the German labour marketwhich has been introduced over the past fewyears at least points in the right direction. Themanufacturing sector, in particular, has beensubject to major restructurings over the pastten years, which have ultimately also had theeffect of raising labour productivity andlowering unit labour costs. In terms of theseunit labour costs, the international competi-tiveness of German enterprises has substan-tially improved over the past few years. Vis-/C224-vis that of enterprises in 19 industrial coun-tries, it is now almost 19% more favourable
than in 1995, when it reached a low. Com-pared with the other euro-area countries,Germany’s competitive position improved by20% in this period.
The general cost discipline in terms of wages,
the flexibility of working hours, the broaderrange of forms of employment and more effi-cient production processes contributed to thisimprovement. However, the rise in labourproductivity partly also involved the sheddingof labour and the associated social adjust-ment costs. Nevertheless, the labour marketreforms facilitate the reintegration of theseworkers, since the reservation wage is not asrigid as previously.

26the opposite direction. Given the worldwide
factor endowment, however, it is also not for-ward-looking to think that the wage costscomponent alone would enable the retentionof large-scale labour-intensive production,which is in direct competition with importsfrom suppliers from countries with very lowwages.
Consequently, a major determinant of the
German labour market’s standing in theglobal environment will always be the provi-sion of market-related in-service training forthe workforce. In this context, it will becomeincreasingly important to continuously adjusthigher education and further training to newchallenges. An empirical study with Germandata at corporate level shows that innov-ations are the driving force behind Germanexports.
23When Germany’s future economic
viability is being considered, this assigns acentral role to an efficient education system.It is an important determinant of the location-al quality and forms the key to the efficientuse of the advantages that globalisationoffers to advanced economies.
Foreign trade, world market shares and
structural change
Over the past few years, German exporters
have made an important contribution tooverall economic growth in Germany.
24For
example, while real GDP has expanded by14% since 1995, exports have more thandoubled in this period. At the same time,however, there has been a marked increase inthe import content of German exports (from31% in 1995 to 41
1/C252% in 2005). This reflects
the closer cross-border ties and the growingfragmentation of producing goods for exportin the global environment. The determinantsthat have shaped Germany’s relative positionon the world markets in the globalisation pro-cess are examined below. This involves rela-tive price fluctuations, the patterns of special-isation that have developed over the years aswell as exogenous changes and correspond-ing adjustment reactions.%

27The price ratio of the German export and im-
port goods on the world market (terms oftrade) has fluctuated sharply since the early1970s. After showing a clear downwardtrend from the start of the first oil crisis to theend of the second oil crisis, the price ratiorose sharply in the mid-1980s owing to theemerging fall in prices for crude oil and hassince been moving mainly sideways, with aninterim peak before the turn of the millen-nium.
The real world market shares of German ex-
ports rose to over 10% between 1970 and1985,
25only to fall again owing to the influ-
ence of growing competition from Europeand Asia and later also to German reunifica-tion to barely more than 8% and thereforeactually below the 1970 level. Since the mid-1990s, there has been another slight upwardtrend, with the result that Germany’s exportshares reached almost 9% in 2005. All in all,the German terms of trade and the real worldmarket shares have mostly been moving inopposite directions since the early 1970s. Animportant link between the two variables isthe relationship between the terms of tradeand the real exchange rate, which symbolisesa country’s price competitiveness.
While the terms of trade describe the price
ratio between export and import goods, thereal exchange rate converts the domesticprice level to foreign currency and sets it in re-lation to the foreign price level.
26Accordingly,
the relationship between the terms of tradeand the real exchange rate is all the closer,the more the law of one price is applied inthe world markets and the more pronouncedthe correlation between the price develop-
ment for export goods and the price indexthat is used for the calculation of the realexchange rate is.
27
Price competitiveness, for its part, is a centraldeterminant of the development of a coun-try’s shares of world exports. Together withnon-price factors, it has a significant influ-ence on how an economy fares under theconditions of globalisation. Moreover, theworld market shares are influenced by the re-gional and sectoral composition of exports.This “structural effect” can be separatedfrom the actual competition effect by meansof an analysis of constant market shares.
28
The structural effect illustrates the changes inworld market share that result from the re-
25At prices and exchange rates in the year 2000. For a
calculation of real world market shares, see also Deutsche
Bundesbank, Germany’s world market shares, Monthly
Report, November 2002, p 40.
26If the price level is compared with the weighted aver-
age of the price indices of the most important trading
partners, this is called the real effective exchange rate.

28gional specialisation (market effect) and the
sectoral specialisation (product effect) of aneconomy.
29For example, if German exports
are more (less) closely oriented to the rapidlygrowing regional or sectoral markets thanother countries, the German share of worldexports rises (falls). The structural effect ispositive (negative). The following calculationsare based on prices, exchange rates and ex-port shares in the year 2000.
30Between 1985 and 2005, the benefit whichGerman exports had from the strong growthin world exports to Asia was below average.German exports are not as strongly represent-ed in these markets as those of its internationalcompetitors whereas they show a high degreeof specialisation in the comparatively slow-growing euro-area markets (see chart on thispage).
31From the mid-1990s, German export-
ers benefited from their presence in centraland east European transition countries, whoseimport growth recently was also well abovethe growth in world trade. All in all, however,the regional focus of German exports has ham-pered the development of the export shares.
The sectoral perspective shows a specialisa-
tion of German exports in mechanical engin-eering and the manufacture of transportequipment, while the local enterprises in thehi-tech sector of electrical (including com-puters) and optical equipment are under-represented.

30In order to calculate the market effect, the imports of
the individual countries or groups of countries were de-flated by the national import prices. The calculation of
the product effect is based on the sectoral exports of
26 OECD countries. They were adjusted by the national
price deflator of the manufacturing sector and then ag-
gregated. For non-OECD countries, not all of the required
sectoral data were available.
31For example, German exports to Asia (excluding
Japan) accounted for less than 10% of German exportsin the base year 2000, while the share of worldwide ex-
ports to Asia (excluding Japan) was over 20%. By con-
trast, the other euro-area member countries absorbed
some 45% of German exports but only just over one-
fifth of global exports.
32The shares of the mechanical engineering sector and
of the manufacturers of transport equipment in Germanexports in the base year 2000 were 15% and 24%, re-
spectively, and thus well above the OECD average. By
comparison, electrical and optical equipment accounted
for almost one-quarter of the exports of all OECD coun-
tries. In Germany, it accounted for only 19%.... negative

29changes that affected the composition of ex-
ports from industrial countries, these hi-techsectors and – to a lesser degree – the manu-facture of transport equipment have grownvery rapidly, while the other sectors have be-come less important. All in all, the sectoralspecialisation of German enterprises – withrespect to the group of countries consideredhere – had a mostly neutral effect on their ex-port development over the past few years.
The competition effect reflects the aggre-
gated development of the market shareswithin the respective sectors and regionalareas. In mathematical terms, it representsthe residual of the changes in the world mar-ket shares after adjustment for the structuraleffect. It can be determined by indicators forboth price and non-price competitiveness.A suitable measure of price competitiveness isthe corresponding indicator of the Bundes-bank based on the deflator of total sales. Onthe other hand, Germany’s inward and out-ward direct investment, together with otherfactors, influence the non-price competitive-ness of German exporters (see the explana-tory notes on page 30).
The slight loss of real world market shares
over the past 20 years was due not only tothe aforementioned unfavourable structuraleffect but also to a negative competition ef-fect. Over the whole period, price competi-tiveness has slightly deteriorated, while non-price competitiveness experienced only minorchanges.
Given the course of German shares in world
exports between 1985 and 2005, however, itseems reasonable to make a distinction be-
tween the first decade, which was shaped bya marked decline, and the last ten years, inwhich German exports regained world mar-ket shares. The losses in export shares be-tween 1985 and 1995 were accompanied bya deterioration in all the aforementioned de-terminants. The negative market effect and a%

30Determinants of Germany’s real world market shares
Changes in a national economy’s share of real exports may
be broken down into a structural effect and a competition
effect .1The structural effect stems from the regional and
structural specialisation of exports. The competition effectreflects changes in the export shares within each of the sec-tors and export markets. To illustrate this, the presentstudy employs indicators for both price and non-price com-petitiveness. A suitable measure of price competitiveness isthe real exchange rate based on the deflator of totalsales.
2However, Germany’s inward and outward direct in-
vestment, together with other factors, influence the non-price competitiveness of German exporters. The periodstudied runs from 1981 to 2005. Estimates of the influenceson the competition effect are based on the followingequation:
(1)WE
t¼/C110þ/C111PWF tþ/C112FDIa
t/C01þ/C113FDIi

where WE is the competition effect (calculated as the real
world market share less market and product effects); PWF
is the indicator of price competitiveness based on the price
deflator of total sales;3FDIais the level of German direct
investment abroad expressed as a percentage of global dir-ect investment stocks; FDI
iis foreign direct investment in
Germany expressed as a percentage of global direct invest-ment stocks; and tis the time index. The data are the loga-
rithms of real variables at prices and exchange rates in theyear 2000.

This interplay presumably reflects international competi-tion among investment locations where the home countryof an enterprise is becoming increasingly irrelevant. It isalso connected with the increasing integration of emer-ging economies in Asia and in central and eastern Europe;these countries have become significantly more attractivetargets for direct investment. German enterprises are rela-tively strong performers in direct investment, not only inEurope, but also in China and India. However, Germanyseems to have lost some ground as a host country for in-ward direct investment.
The second cointegration relationship shows the connec-
tion between the competition effect and price and non-price competitiveness. As expected, improvements in pricecompetitiveness are associated with above-average in-creases in German exports on an international comparison.Concurrently, changes in the German share of global directinvestment stocks entail the export shares being adjustedin the same direction. This suggests that German enter-prises enhance their international competitiveness by shift-ing parts of the production process abroad. Furthermore,access to foreign expertise or improved access to exportmarkets could also play a role here.
1See Annex, p 33. — 2The number of new patents regis-
tered by German firms in comparison with that of the rest
of the world was not significant in statistical terms; for thisreason it was not employed as a measure of non-price com-petitiveness in the results presented here. — 3An increase
in the PWF variable implies a deterioration in price com-petitiveness. — 4Direct investment is price-adjusted in the
local currency using the national GDP deflator. Globalstocks of direct investment were approximated by the fig-ures for 27 OECD countries as well as China, Hong Kong,India and Russia. More than 94% of global stocks werecaptured in this manner in 2005. — 5The Augmented
Dickey-Fuller test (ADF), Phillips-Perron test (PPT) and theKwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin test were carried out. —6When interpreting the data, it is important to note that
this study defines the stocks of direct investment as ratiosto global stocks.

31marked decline in price competitiveness had
the greatest impact in this period.33
German reunification was also a special factorin the first half of the 1990s and seems to havehad a direct effect both on price and non-pricecompetitiveness. Owing to the heavy demandfrom the new federal states, goods and prob-ably also investible funds, which would other-wise have gone abroad, were increasingly dir-ected from the federal territory as formerlydefined to eastern Germany. At the same time,German imports increased. Moreover, the fa-vourable economic developments in Germanyfollowing reunification resulted in significantwage increases, which had a detrimental effecton price competitiveness.
Since 1995, by contrast, both price and non-
price competitiveness, so far as the latter ismeasured in terms of German direct invest-ment abroad, have developed favourably. Atthe same time, the negative contribution ofthe market effect has markedly declined. Inthis case, it seems that the special position ofGerman enterprises in the central and eastEuropean growth markets has had a positiveeffect. Overall, however, the dominance oftrade with other EU member states, com-bined with a below-average presence in thefaster growing Asian markets, has slowedGerman export developments up to now.
As expected, following the catching-up pro-
cess of the emerging market economies, theshare of the industrial countries in worldtrade tended to decrease. Compared withsuppliers from the other industrial countries,however, German exporters have so far heldtheir ground against the increasing competi-
tion by the emerging economies. By contrast,the real shares of the USA and Japan in worldexports have further declined over the pastten years, during which Germany made goodsome of its previous losses, and were 3 per-centage points and 1 percentage point, re-spectively, below the corresponding values of1995. Within the EU, the United Kingdom,France and Italy also suffered losses. Con-versely, the real world market shares ofthe Asian economies excluding Japan rosein this period by 9 percentage points to 27%.

32In 2005, the People’s Republic of China ac-
counted for about one-third of this.
German enterprises benefited from the fact
that the range of goods offered by the newcompetitors is rather more complementarythan substitutionary to German exports. Fur-thermore, German enterprises have made useof the cost advantages of foreign locationsand – as described above – have increasedtheir own competitiveness by relocating pro-duction processes.
This interpretation is consistent with the find-
ing that German direct investment abroadhas a positive influence on the export busi-ness of domestic enterprises. Moreover, em-pirical studies show that, in the long term,German direct investment abroad can be ex-pected to have a favourable influence on do-mestic investment activity. This means thatthe employment effect is also more likely tobe positive.
34This argues against concerns
that regard the intensive direct investment ofdomestic enterprises as a threat to employ-ment in Germany.
However, the challenges for the German
economy are not expected to decline in fu-ture if the structural change that can be seenespecially in China and India continues andthese countries become increasingly competi-tive in areas where the advanced economiesstill see their comparative advantages.
35
Against this background, the ability of enter-prises to react quickly to a changed environ-ment will be a decisive competitive factor inthe future.
Summary and conclusions
The globalisation of the world economy has
undoubtedly changed the framework for theindividual economies. In general, however, in-dustrial countries, emerging market econ-omies and developing countries can benefitfrom the extended opportunities provided bythe international division of labour.

33enter into competition with other countries.
While German enterprises have mainly react-ed very successfully to the new challenges,the economic policy makers must still act tocreate an environment that facilitates adjust-ment processes and thus makes it possible tofully exploit the advantages arising from glob-alisation. This applies especially to the labourmarket. Here, the structural change requiresa high degree of flexibility in order to facilitatethe move to new employment in the case ofjob losses. This also involves an appropriateeducation policy in order to strengthen in-novative capacities and future economic via-bility. Only in this way can the adjustmentburdens accompanying structural change bekept as low as possible in an industrial coun-try such as Germany. Resorting to protection-ist measures, by contrast, does not hold outany prospect of success.

35The economic
situation of small
and medium-sized
enterprises in Germany
since 1997Small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) continue to play a major role inthe German economy. This article,which follows on from earlier studiesof the profitability and financing ofsmall and medium-sized enterprises, isbased, for the first time, on the Bun-desbank’s Financial Statements Data-pool. In the period from 1997 to 2004,SMEs’ profits in the sectors coveredhere showed a marked rise. Given amostly unfavourable overall economicsetting, this was achieved, first andforemost, by maintaining a notablelevel of cost discipline. During theperiod under review, SMEs also madeup ground with regard to their provi-sion with equity, albeit in the contextof a shrinking balance sheet total.
In 2005, enterprises’ gross profits
showed a further sharp increase over-all, although there were major differ-ences at the individual level. They alsofurther improved their financial viabil-ity. Since 1997, their equity ratio hasgone up by an average of 8 percentagepoints. SMEs are likely to have partici-pated in this favourable development,although, currently, no separate dataare available for them for 2005. This issuggested, not least, by the fact thatdomestic economic activity – on whichSMEs are especially dependent –picked up noticeably in the course ofthe year.

36SMEs are often described as the backbone of
the German economy.1Their importance for
the economy as a whole is revealed, aboveall, by the fact that, in 2003 (according todata provided by the Institute for SME Re-search, Institut f/C252r Mittelstandsforschung –
IfM), 99.7% of all enterprises subject to turn-
over tax were SMEs and that these generatedroughly 41% of the total sales recorded in theturnover tax statistics. Moreover, in 2003,around 70% of wage and salary earners inthe corporate sector were employed in smalland medium-sized firms, and over 80% of allapprentices were being trained in the SMEsector.
2According to the Federal Statistical
Office’s structural survey in manufacturing,which is a key sector in the present study,roughly half of the total of 6.1 million wageand salary earners in the sector were workingin SMEs with up to 499 employees in 2004.

SMEs in a difficult macroeconomic setting
In cyclical terms, the period under analysis
can usefully be divided into several phases.The first phase was characterised by the up-swing that lasted up to mid-2000. Followingthe exaggerations in the financial markets in2001, this then led into a persistent phase ofsemi-stagnation which lasted until mid-2003.Thereafter, expansionary forces gradually pre-vailed again, although the recovery initially re-mained quite hesitant and fragile. This wasdue mainly to the fact that the expansionaryimpulses came only from exports while realdomestic demand was still tending to beweak. In the course of 2004, however, the ex-ternal dynamics were reinforced by industrialinvestment, which was reflected in a strongerdemand for machinery and equipment. Bycontrast, the adjustment crisis in the Germanconstruction sector, which began in the mid-1990s and affected not only residential con-struction but also industrial and public con-struction, did not come to an end until 2005.Apart from a brief interlude in 1999, how-ever, construction output generated retardingeffects on balance throughout the periodunder review. Furthermore, private consump-tion failed to provide any major stimuli in2004 and 2005 either.
Over the period from 1997 to 2004 as a
whole, real GDP grew by 10% or 1
1/C254%o na n
annual average, with domestic demand in-creasing by
3/C254% and exports by 7% per year.
Exports thus made a cumulative contributionto growth of 15
3/C254percentage points. Exports
have had a large and growing import contentsince the mid-1990s, however, which meansthat imports, too, showed a sharp rise. As aresult, exports’ net contribution to growth, at4
1/C254percentage points, was noticeably lower.
In the industrial sectors, the contrast betweensluggish domestic business and buoyant ex-port activity was even more marked than inthe economy as a whole. According to the of-
1See also the comments of the Federal Ministry of Eco-
nomics on SME policy (www.bmwi.de).
2The information on employment and training is based
on Federal Employment Agency data on employees sub-ject to social security contributions. These data cover op-
erating units rather than enterprises. This means that
small and medium-sized firms are overweighted; SMEs
are often part of large enterprises, especially in the trade
sector. On the other hand, subsidised low-paid part-time
employment (such as mini-jobs), which is provided very
largely by SMEs, is not recorded in these statistics.

37New database and definition of SMEs
In this article, which follows on from earlier
studies,1the situation of German small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is analysed
for the first time on the basis of the Financial
Statements Datapool. Annual reporting on
German firms’ profitability and financing as a
whole was rebased on the new datapool in
2005.2This study presents extrapolation results
broken down not only by sector but also by
size category and legal form for the period
1997 to 2004. More recent results are not yet
available in such detail. However, the profit-
ability and financing trends of 2005 for the en-
tire corporate sector captured by the statistics
are presented in the box on page 45 on the basis
of projected data. This reveals a continuation of
the positive development in both profitability
and financing which had started earlier.3
The statistical definition of small and medium-
sized enterprises is normally based on the cri-
teria “annual sales” and “number of employ-
ees”. Studies of SMEs in Germany are often
based on the definition of the Institute for SME
Research (IfM). According to this definition,
firms are classified as small enterprises if they
have annual sales of less than 51 million and
up to nine employees. Medium-sized enter-
prises are those with annual sales of 51 million
to550 million and between 10 and 499employees. Firms with larger sales and/or more
staff are deemed to be large companies.4
Only the classification by turnover size is rele-
vant to the following analysis of SMEs’ profit-
ability and financing, however. This is because
the financial statements analysed for the cor-
porate balance sheet statistics do not consist-
ently contain information on the number of
employees. Furthermore, small and medium-
sized firms are combined into a single turnover
size category. SMEs which are defined in this
way, however, belong to the Mittelstand in the
real meaning of the word only if the qualita-
tive criterion of complete or far-reaching for-
mal independence is fulfilled. Under the Euro-
pean Commission’s definition, this condition is
met if the capital interest held by another firm
in an SME is below 25%. Fulfilling the criterion
of formal independence reveals little about a
firm’s actual scope for decision-making, how-
ever. This is often very constricted in the case of
a smaller firm that depends on one or a few
large customers and if these customers have a
large say in determining product characteris-
tics, prices and other business terms and condi-
tions. Firms that are not independent cannot
be eliminated from the Bundesbank’s extrapo-
lations. Nevertheless, any resulting inaccuracies
are likely to be limited.

The changes in methodology – above all, inconnection with the setting up of the Financial StatementsDatapool and the approach to extrapolation – were ex-plained in detail in the annex to that article. — 3See
Deutsche Bundesbank, German enterprises’ profitabilityand financing in 2004, Monthly Report, June 2006, pp 55-77. — 4The European Commission recommendations on
the definition of SMEs include “micro-enterprises” as anadditional category of firms and, as a further distinguish-ing feature in addition to the number of employees and
turnover, the balance sheet total. In the new recommenda-tion that has been in force since 1 January 2005, firms witha turnover of up to 550 million are included – as in our
definition – in the category of SMEs. The thresholds foremployment and the balance sheet total are 249 personsand 543 million respectively. In addition, individual thresh-
olds are set for both micro and small enterprises. As theEuropean SME promotion programmes are geared to thesethresholds, some German federal states have adopted thenumber of 249 employees as the ceiling for medium-sizedenterprises (see Institut f/C252r Mittelstandsforschung, Mit-telstand – Definition und Schl/C252sselzahlen, www.ifm-bonn.org/dienste/definition.htm, p 3).

38ficial turnover statistics for manufacturing
and mining, domestic sales increased by justunder one-tenth in value between 1997 and2004, while export sales went up by 50%.
The weakness of domestic German economic
activity in the first half of the current decadehad a greater impact on the business of SMEsthan it did on that of large enterprises. This isdue to the fact that SMEs traditionally servicethe domestic markets to a greater extent andhad a markedly smaller presence than largefirms in the more thriving foreign marketsduring the period under review (see box onpages 40 and 41). What is striking is thatSMEs’ earnings nevertheless showed a strongimprovement. In this context, the SMEs– which tend to be more labour-intensive –benefited, in particular, from the persistentlymoderate wage developments in Germanysince the mid-1990s. Gross wages and salar-ies per employee in the economy as a wholewent up on an annual average by no morethan 1
1/C254% between 1997 and 2004. The rise
in unit labour costs calculated on an hourlybasis was even smaller during this period atjust under
1/C252% per year. Furthermore, the in-
creased dropout of unprofitable firms helpedto boost the trend in profits. At the end ofthe period under review, the economic set-ting for SMEs had improved markedly, how-ever, with the accelerated pick-up in domesticdemand.
The fact that SMEs were in a difficult situation
in the 1997-2004 period despite this im-provement in profitability is very obvious fromthe substantial increase in corporate insolven-cies. In this context, the overall number of in-solvencies can be used a yardstick since thevast majority of cases recorded in the officialstatistics involve SMEs. Of the firms which be-came insolvent in 2005 and for which dataon employment are available, 83% had fiveemployees at most and only 190, or
1/C252%, of
the insolvent enterprises had a workforce ofmore than 100 employees. Most of these 190firms are also likely to be assignable to thecategory of SMEs since the thresholds mark-ing the transition to large enterprises are sig-nificantly higher, namely at 249 employeesaccording to the European Commission’s def-inition or 499 employees according to theIfM’s definition. Although the major insolven-cies during the observation period were thusof little significance in terms of their number,they attracted more public attention owingto the accompanying large job losses.Log scale

39The number of corporate insolvencies
reached a new peak in 2003. At 39,320, theywere 43% up on 1997.
4Insolvency cases
have been declining since 2004, however. In2005, the number of firms that became in-solvent was 6
1/C254% lower than in 2003. In
2004, however, the frequency of insolvencies,ie the number of insolvencies per 10,000 en-terprises, at 134, was only slightly down onthe 2003 ratio. It was only in 2005 that therewas a perceptible fall. The main reason forthis is likely to have been the continuing eco-nomic upturn with higher profits and an im-provement in liquidity and the fact that pay-ment behaviour led in many cases to a finan-cial easing for many firms.
There was a very sharp (75%) rise in the num-
ber of insolvent non-corporations
5between
1997 and 2003, while there was an increaseof 23% in the case of corporations. This dis-crepancy is due, first, to non-corporations’generally weaker equity base, which makes itmore difficult to cover losses and bridge li-quidity shortages in economically difficulttimes. Second, the possibility of deferring thecosts of insolvency proceedings that has exist-ed since the end of 2001 triggered an up-surge in insolvencies of small enterprises, thevast majority of which were operated as non-corporations, in the ensuing years. In 2004and 2005, insolvencies of non-corporationscontinued to increase at a more moderatepace, whereas the number of insolvent cor-porations fell back to the 1997 level.Weak business activity,better profitability
In the manufacturing, construction, trade,
transport and business-related services sec-tors under analysis, the value of SMEs’ grossrevenue – which, in addition to sales, includeschanges in stocks of finished goods as well asother own work capitalised – grew by nomore than 2% overall in the period from1997 to 2004. This was due to a rather sub-dued increase up to 2000 and a sharp cumu-lative decline of 4
1/C252% between 2001 and
2003. In 2004, business activity picked upagain by 2
1/C252%. By comparison, large enter-
prises’ gross revenue expanded much moresharply. In 2004, it was roughly 30% higherthan in 1997, which corresponds to an aver-age annual growth of just under 4%. Only in2002 was a slight fall recorded along with vir-tual stagnation in 2003. In all the other years,the volume of business expanded quite vigor-ously.
The main reason for these diverging develop-
ments in business was the above-mentionedweakness of domestic economic activity,which placed a strain, first and foremost, onSMEs. In this context, the ongoing crisis ofadjustment in the construction sector sincethe mid-1990s had an especially large influ-ence. Small and medium-sized enterprises areheavily represented in this sector – they ac-

40Deutsche BundesbankThe export business of German enterprises according to size category and economic sector
The data from the official turnover tax statistics on tax-
able sales with input tax deduction allow the export ac-tivities of enterprises in Germany to be studied in moredetail.
1The respective average share of small, medium-
sized and large enterprises which conduct business withforeign customers can be inferred from the breakdownof the data by size category, while the ratio of exports tototal sales for the group of firms with export business canalso be determined.
2Studies based on size category can
be carried out for the totality of enterprises as well as forindividual economic sectors and legal forms.
According to calculations based on the turnover tax stat-
istics for 2004, the share of enterprises conducting busi-ness with foreign customers in the economic sectors stud-ied – manufacturing, construction, trade, transport, andbusiness-related services – was, at 15
1/C252%, markedly high-
er than in the economic sectors not covered by the cor-porate balance sheet statistics (4%). The average exportratio of the enterprises with export business studiedstood at 20
1/C252% in 2004, compared with 6% for the other
firms. The large difference can be put down to the factthat the manufacturing sector, which constitutes the coreof the corporate balance sheet statistics, is traditionallyvery export-orientated. In this sector, 28
1/C252% of firms op-
erate in foreign markets, achieving one-third of theirturnover there.
Export business is likewise fairly important in the whole-
sale trade and in the transport sector. By comparison, ex-ports play more of a minor role in the construction sector,since the vast bulk of production needs to be carried outon site. To a lesser extent, this also applies to the retailtrade and to providers of business-related services. In allthe areas specified, however, participation in export busi-ness and, in most cases, export ratios are higher than thecorresponding average figures for the economic sectorswhich are not covered. A key role is played in the lattercategory, for example, by household service providers,who operate almost exclusively in local markets withinGermany.
Of the enterprises studied in the turnover size category
of less than 51 million, only 11% were active in foreign
markets. In the case of enterprises with turnover of be-tween 51 million and 550 million, the ratio, at 48
1/C252%,
was much higher, albeit considerably below the compar-able figure for large enterprises (87%). Similarly, the ex-port ratios of small and medium-sized enterprises withexport business were much smaller than for larger firms.For example, small firms generated just 2
1/C252% of their
sales abroad. In the medium-sized category, the exportratio amounted to 13
1/C252%, compared with 261/C252% for
large enterprises.
In the analysis by size category, pronounced differences
are evident between the major economic sectors. For ex-ample, small firms’ involvement in export business in2004 ranged from 4
1/C252% in the construction sector to
161/C252% in the manufacturing sector and 21% in the
wholesale trade. Their corresponding export ratiosranged from 0.5% in the construction sector to 7
1/C252%i n
the wholesale trade. In the segment of medium-sized en-terprises, too, construction firms featured at the bottomend of the scale, with an export participation level of19
1/C252% and an export ratio of 21/C252%. At the top of the
scale was the manufacturing sector in terms of the par-ticipation level (67%) and the transport sector in terms ofthe percentage of sales (22
1/C252%).
The strong export orientation of German industry is par-ticularly clear in the case of large enterprises, 94
1/C252%o f
which are active in foreign markets, where they generate38% of their sales. In the transport sector the two ratiosare likewise relatively high, at 85% and 42
1/C252%. While
over 80% of large firms in the wholesale and retail trade
1Tax-free goods and services are usually excluded from input tax de-
duction. However, this does not apply to exported goods and services,
and, in certain other cases, such as turnover from air and sea travel,and deliveries of gold to central banks, etc These items are aggre-gated in the turnover tax statistics, meaning that export sales cannotbe separately distinguished. However, the latter represent by far themost important form of goods and services with input taxdeduction. — 2By contrast, the import ratios of German enterprises
cannot be determined by using the turnover tax statistics. The reason

41were involved in export business in 2004, their exports ac-
counted for just 151/C252% and 3%, respectively, of their
total turnover. Of the large construction enterprises,65
1/C252% were active abroad, with an export ratio of 6%.
The foreign presence of business-related service pro-viders with sales of 550 million or more was even smaller
(58%). However, they still conducted 12% of their busi-ness outside Germany.
Within the manufacturing sector, too, the importance of
export business varies very greatly. For example, just 9%of firms in the food industry supplied foreign markets in2004, in which they generated 13
1/C252% of their sales. This
is connected firstly to the fact that eating habits can varygreatly from one country to another, and, secondly, thatthe refrigeration which is necessary in many cases drivesup transport costs. By contrast, around half of chemical
enterprises and of manufacturers of machinery andequipment exported products abroad, amounting to42% and 44
1/C252%, respectively, of their total sales. Graded
by size category, it is the medium-sized manufacturers ofmachinery and equipment that achieved the highestscores; more than 80% of them sold products outsideGermany in 2004, achieving an export ratio of 33
1/C252%.
The large enterprises in this segment even achieved ashare of sales of 52% outside Germany. In terms of theexport ratio, medium-sized firms also had a strong for-eign presence of more than 20% in most of the othermanufacturing subsectors. However, the large enterprisesin these industries consistently achieve much higherratios.

revenue – clearly lagged behind the large en-terprises (+39%). However, this was due lessto the divergent developments in the Germaneconomy than to the continuing advance ofthe big discount chains, which, over the pastfew years, has been further fostered by theconstrained income situation of many house-holds. SMEs’ share of total sales consequentlyfell from 60% in 1997 to 52
1/C252% in 2004. By
contrast, small and medium-sized enterprisesperformed relatively well in the business-related services sector, with a rise in gross rev-enue of 27
1/C252% between 1997 and 2004,
compared with an increase of 451/C252% in the
case of large enterprises. Accordingly, SMEsaccounted for as much as 70
1/C252% of sales in
this sector at the end of the period under re-view. One reason for their strong position islikely to lie in the intensive demands for in-novation, say, in the software engineeringsector, which open up market opportunitiesfor new (and, therefore, mostly small) firms.
SMEs’ total income – which includes interest
and similar income as well as other income –grew by just over 2% between 1997 and2004 and thus scarcely more than their grossrevenue. Given the rather unfavourable salestrend, SMEs made a concerted effort to con-tain the rise in costs. Such efforts were verysuccessful in that SMEs’ total expenses (be-fore taxes on income) went up by less than1% in the period covered by the analysis,while large enterprises’ total expenses – inthe context of a higher increase in sales –grew by 30
1/C252%.
The main reason for this discrepancy was thefact that SMEs, with sales growing only mod-erately, were able to make a slight reduction(-1%) in their cost of materials, whereas thisitem showed a sharp (37
1/C252%) increase in the
case of large enterprises – not least owing tocontinued outsourcing and the steep rise inimported inputs. Furthermore, SMEs’ person-nel expenses were not much higher in 2004than in 1997 (+
1/C252%) and even showed a fall
compared with the period from 2000 to2002. By contrast, extensive restructuringmeasures and increased pension provisionsnecessitated by the decline in market interestrates over the past few years helped to pushup the staff costs of larger firms, which con-sequently remained at a high level despitefalling employment figures. The alleviating ef-fects of what have been quite sharp job cutsare therefore likely to be reflected in their in-come statements only after a certain delay.Overall income

43The sharp (151/C252%) decline in depreciation
also played a part in SMEs’ favourable costdevelopment. This is likely to be a reflection,first, of weak investment in the past fewyears. Second, SMEs were far less affected bythe “bubble” that formed at the turn of themillennium than were the large enterprises,which had to book sizeable write-downs onlong-term investments and securities port-folios in the years that followed. Furthermore,SMEs’ interest and similar expenses showed amarked decline – by almost one-quarter since1997. This was due to a reduction in thestock of interest-bearing liabilities. Moreover,the long and short-term lending rates forSMEs showed a perceptible fall between1999 and 2004. Although small andmedium-sized enterprises’ overall ratio ofinterest expenses to gross revenue, at 1
1/C252%,
was on the low side at the end of the periodunder review, owing to the greater weight ofbank loans in their overall financing, SMEs’interest expenses were noticeably higher thanthose of the large enterprises (just under
1/C252%). Among the major cost items, it was
only SMEs’ “other expenses” (which com-prise rental and leasing expenditure, researchand development costs as well as spendingon advertising) which showed a significantrise (16
1/C252%) during the observation period.
Thanks to their cost discipline, SMEs were
able to boost their overall profitability. In theperiod from 1997 to 2004, for example, theannual result before taxes on income in-creased by a total of 44
1/C252% in nominal
terms. In the last two years of the analysedperiod alone, the annual result before taxeson income increased by 32
1/C252%, which morethan offset the decline in the three years be-
fore. However, in addition to the absolutelevel at the start of the observation period, ithas to be taken into account that, as men-tioned above, many small and medium-sizedfirms – with mostly poor profitability ratios –became insolvent and are therefore no longerrecorded in the corporate balance sheet stat-istics. In comparison with SMEs, the large en-terprises were able to only slightly improve€

44Deutsche BundesbankGerman enterprises‘ proﬁ  tability and ﬁ  nancing in 2005
Carried by the sustained economic recovery, corporate 
proﬁ ts in the manufacturing, construction, trade, trans-
port and business-related services sectors increased mark-
edly again in 2005. According to the estimates,1 the annual 
result before taxes on income was 13% higher than in 2004, when it had already risen by 11½%. This accelerated proﬁ t growth was all the more notable given that the 2004 
ﬁ gure had been boosted by extraordinarily strong positive 
working-day effects, which was not the case in 2005. In the 
year under review corporate earnings outperformed the impressive level seen in 2001 by 18%. The gross return on sales reached 4%, its highest level since 1997. The annual 
result after taxes actually outmatched the gross ﬁ  gure to 
rise by 15%, as taxes on income rose by the relatively mod-erate rate of 5%.
All sectors of the economy experienced particularly strong 
growth in their gross annual result. In manufacturing, the 
annual result before taxes on income rose by 9½%, follow-
ing 5½% in 2004. However, this was not quite enough to 
compensate for the decline in the annual result during the 
period from 2001 to 2003. At 4%, the return on sales was 
just over ½ percentage point below the peak measured 
in 2000. The proﬁ  t trend in manufacturing was hampered 
by the steep rise in the cost of materials caused not only 
by higher energy prices but also the hefty increase in the prices of industrial raw materials. The ongoing outsour-cing process, which led to an upward trend in the share of 
intermediate goods and services, also made itself felt.
The overall rise in corporate proﬁ  ts in 2005 is largely attrib-
utable to the perceptible and broadly based 4% expan-
sion of business activities. Signiﬁ  cant growth occurred not 
only in manufacturing, but also in the wholesale trade, transport and business-related services. By contrast, sales in the construction industry fell further, although not as 
markedly as in the preceding years; they only bottomed 
out over the course of 2005. Furthermore, retail trade was 
only able to expand its gross revenue by a marginal 1½% owing to persistently weak consumption. Enterprises’ total income, which also includes interest and similar income as 
well as other income, rose by 4% in 2005, compared with a 
3½% rise in total expenses (before taxes on income).On the cost side in 2005, the above-average rise in the cost of materials (+5%) was accompanied by only a small increase 
in personnel expenses (+½%). This reﬂ  ects  ongoing muted 
wage growth, continued job-shedding and the increasing

models in large parts of the economy. Other cost-curbing 
factors were the 4½% decline in depreciation charges and 
the 2½% easing of the burden of interest paid. Operating taxes and other expenses grew by 3½% each.
The balance sheet total of the enterprises in the economic 
sectors under review grew by just over 3½% in 2005. This 
was the strongest growth since the boom year 2000. It 
reﬂ ects the pick-up in business activity as well as the sub-
stantial improvement in earnings. On the assets side, it is 
noteworthy that the stock of non-ﬁ  nancial assets, which 
had tended to fall since 2001, rose by 1%. The main reason 
for this was the marked increase in inventories. By con-
trast, tangible ﬁ  xed assets remained at the prior-year level 
while intangible ﬁ  xed assets, which had risen perceptibly 
in 2004, dropped considerably.
The rise in ﬁ  nancial assets by 5½% was a decisive factor in 
the growth of the asset total. They consequently further 
increased their preponderance over non-ﬁ  nancial assets. 
The 12% rise in other long-term equity investments was 
particularly sharp; this item‘s share of the balance sheet 
total reached a new all-time high of just over 13½%. Other long-term equity investments grew strongly in all sectors, 
particularly in transport and business-related services. Cash holdings, too, were stepped up clearly (+4%). This 
presumably reﬂ  ects the creation of a ﬁ  nancial buffer for 
a future expansion of tangible ﬁ  xed assets or the acquisi-
tion of additional long-term equity investments. The stock 
of receivables grew by 4½%, with trade receivables also 
expanding for the ﬁ  rst time since 2000.
On the capital side of the balance sheet, the trend towards 
strengthening the equity base, which has been evident for some time now, progressed further. In 2005, equity grew 
by 9%, following 6½% in 2004. As a result, the equity ratio gained more than 1 percentage point to make up 24% of the balance sheet total. This increase was solely 
due to retained proﬁ  ts and contributions to the capital of 
non-corporations, whereas corporations recorded no net 
increase in equity. However, the equity ratio continued to 
vary considerably across the individual sectors. Thus the equity ratio ranged from 10½% in the construction sector 
to 28% in manufacturing. Since 1997, the equity ratio of all enterprises has risen by 8 percentage points.
The growth in the importance of equity on the capital side 
of the balance sheet was accompanied by a decline in the weight of liabilities, which made up 56% in 2005 com-
pared with 64½% in 1997. The stock of liabilities rose by 
1% in 2005. The reduction in liabilities to banks (-3%) was 
more than offset by the increase in trade payables (+3%), 
in liabilities to afﬁ  liated companies (+3½%) and in pay-
ments received on account of orders (+4½%). Enterprises‘ 
combined provisions increased by 4½%, with provisions 
for company pensions actually being raised by 5½%.
Enterprises’ liquidity rose once again perceptibly in 2005. 
Cash resources and short-term receivables covered 92½% 
of short-term liabilities, compared with 90% in 2004. The cash ﬂ  ow as a percentage of liabilities and provisions less 
cash came to 16½% and was thus 2 percentage points 
above the most recent low in 2003.

46their profitability situation. In 2004, their
gross profits were just 11% higher than in1997 and 14
1/C252% below their previous peak
of 2001.
It is striking that the corporations among the
SMEs were able to double their gross annualresult, while the non-corporations clearlylagged behind with a growth of 31
1/C252%. This
was partly due to the fact that the non-corporations started out from a markedlyhigher level. In the legal forms of partnershipand sole proprietorship, the (imputed) entre-preneurial income, ie the remuneration forthe entrepreneur’s labour, is included in thereported annual result. By contrast, corpor-ations record the salaries of managers andtop executives as personnel expenses, whichmeans that the reported profit of non-corporations is correspondingly higher. In linewith this, at the end of the period under re-view, non-corporations generated 56% ofthe gross revenue of SMEs while accountingfor 75% of the overall gross annual result.Non-corporations’ profits, more narrowly de-fined, are likely to have developed along simi-larly dynamic lines as the profits of corpor-ations.
The gross return on sales, which is the ratio
of the annual result before taxes on incometo enterprises’ sales, improved in the case ofSMEs from 3
1/C252% in 1997 to 5% in 2004.6By
contrast, large firms’ gross return on sales fellby
1/C252percentage point to 3%.7The very
sharp increase in the ratio of intermediateconsumption and the matching slowergrowth in value added in this entrepreneurialsegment mean that the lower return on salesshould not be overinterpreted. Moreover, thedifferential between the returns on sales inthe two size categories is biased by the factthat, in the category of SMEs, a larger part ofthe recorded annual result is to be regarded,as mentioned above, as entrepreneurial in-come. First, the imputed entrepreneurial in-come plays a more important role in the caseof sole proprietorships and partnerships –measured by the annual result as a whole –and, second, a notably larger percentage ofSMEs are operated as non-corporations.Given this situation, it is advisable to compareonly corporations among the SMEs with thelarge enterprises, the vast majority of whichoperate in the legal form of a limited liabilitycompany ( Gesellschaft mit beschr/C228nkter Haf-
tung – GmbH ) or public limited company
(Aktiengesellschaft – AG ). In the period under
analysis, the gross return on sales of the smalland medium-sized corporations increased by1
1/C252percentage points to 3%, which meant
that, in 2004, it was as high as that of thelarger firms for the first time.
From 1997 to 2004, the gross annual result
showed a double-digit increase in all sectors.There was a 37
1/C252% expansion in the pre-tax
6Net return on sales, which is the ratio of profits after
taxes to sales, is not shown here since this variable pro-
vides little information value in the case of SMEs. Partner-
ships and sole proprietorships are a widespread form of
business organisation among SMEs; their annual results
are taxed in the “private sphere” of the entrepreneurs.
The amount of tax on their income does not appear in
the income statement. The net return on sales can be in-
terpreted meaningfully, at most, for the corporations
among the SMEs.
7The gross operating ratio (ie the operating surplus
as a percentage of turnover) for manufacturing enter-prises, which is calculated by the Federal Statistical Office
for the purposes of the national accounts, shows a similar

48profits of small and medium-sized manufac-
turing firms. Following declining results be-tween 2000 and 2002, the result grew by35% in the two years that followed. Besidesthe decline in depreciation and in interest andsimilar expenses, a major factor in the im-provement in profitability since 1997 was therelatively small rise in personnel expenses of3
1/C252% overall. Following the earnings trough
of 2002, corporations’ gross return on salesrose by a little more than 1 percentage pointto just over 3
1/C252%. By comparison, the larger
manufacturing enterprises suffered deep cutsin their profits even in 2003 and managedonly to stabilise the situation at a low level in2004. Measured by sales, too, the profit theygenerated in that year, at 3
1/C252%, was the low-
est since 2002.
In the construction sector, the SMEs’ profit-
ability ratios have likewise improved followingthe sharp falls at the beginning of the dec-ade. This is due mainly to the fact that themajor expense items have declined either atthe same pace as gross revenue (cost of ma-terials) or more sharply (personnel expenses,depreciation and interest and similar ex-penses). In addition, even more than in othersectors of the economy, the dropout from thestatistics of many struggling firms, as is evi-denced by the high number of insolvencies,tends to overstate the underlying profitability.Moreover, their earnings performance –measured by the gross return on sales of thecorporations among the SMEs – was ultim-ately still unsatisfactory at 2% at the end ofthe period under review. At first glance, thisfinding also applies to the retail trade wherethe corresponding profitability ratio stood atjust over 1
1/C252%. What also has to be taken
into account in this context, however, is thehigh turnover of goods, which signifies a lackof depth in value added relative to sales. Thesmall and medium-sized wholesale firms in-creased their gross profit by just under one-half compared with 1997, with 2003 and2004 accounting for two-thirds of thisgrowth. In relation to sales, the corporationsamong the small and medium-sized whole-sale firms achieved an increase of more than1 percentage point to 2
1/C252% latterly. This was
substantially more than in the case of largeretail firms, which recorded a return of justunder 2% in 2004.
Small and medium-sized providers of
business-related services also recorded sharpincreases in gross profits (+40%) during theperiod under analysis. One major factor inthis was that the cost of materials – which in-cludes intermediate goods and services andwhich accounted for as much as nearly one-third of gross revenue in 2004 – grew by23% and thus significantly more slowly thanthe business volume. The gross return onsales of the SME corporations in this sectorrose from its low of just under 1% in 2001 to4% in 2004. This meant that they still per-formed somewhat less well than the large en-terprises, which reached a figure of almost5%. The strongest percentage growth inprofits achieved by SMEs between 1997 and2004 was in the transport sector at 112%.Although the return on sales of transportcompanies run as corporations overcame itsinitially unfavourable position (-1%), it wasstill quite low at the end of the period under

figure for larger firms (+11/C252%).
Falling balance sheet total and higherequity ratio
The weak growth in SMEs’ business activity in
the period from 1997 to 2004 shaped devel-opments in assets and capital. The balancesheet total actually shrank over this period by1
1/C252%, with a moderate rise up to 2000 being
followed by a decline which did not come toa halt until 2004. It is notable that the bal-ance sheet total of the non-corporations fellby 6% over the observation period as awhole, while that of corporations increasedby 5
1/C252%. By contrast, the large enterprises’
stock of assets and capital increased by381/C252% in line with the dynamic growth in
sales.
Balance sheet developments in the individual
sectors of the economy essentially reflect theexpansion of business activities. Accordingly,SMEs’ assets and capital in the manufacturingsector increased relatively sharply at aroundone-tenth. The increase in the case ofbusiness-related services providers was evensharper at 25%. In the construction sector,the considerable decline in work performedresulted in a roughly 30% reduction in thestock of assets and capital. SMEs’ balancesheet total decreased by 2% in the retailtrade and by 10% in the wholesale trade.This is likewise consistent with developmentsin business in these two areas, which waspointing upwards slightly in the retail tradeSMEs’ return on sales and equity ratio in 2004 by sector

50and which contracted perceptibly in the
wholesale trade. The transport sector issomething of an exception; its assets andcapital in 2004 were no higher than in 1997,although there was a notable expansion ingross revenue.
A major factor in the decline in SMEs’ balance
sheet total during the observation periodwas, on the assets side, the continuing reduc-tion in the stock of non-financial assets: in2004, this was 6
1/C252% lower than in 1997.
This, in turn, was due to a sharp 15% reduc-tion in inventories, while the stock of tangiblefixed assets (including intangible fixed assets)increased by 2
1/C252%.8The reduction in inven-
tories was concentrated on the constructionsector, where the sharp contraction in thewake of the adjustment crisis was accompan-ied by a decline of almost one-third in workin progress shown on the balance sheet since1999. Inventories were also reduced in thewholesale and retail trades, with the focus onlowering inventories of finished goods andmerchandise. Possible reasons for this wereSMEs’ sluggish business in the wholesaletrade and more efficient inventory manage-ment in the retail trade. The relatively weakrise in the stock of tangible fixed assets wasdue, in particular, to the unfavourable trendin construction and in the wholesale trade,while quite notable growth was achieved inthe other sectors. Although gross fixed capitalformation tended to decline in the manufac-turing sector, net investment was invariablypositive, with the exception of 2002 and2003.The decline in SMEs’ non-financial assets wasaccompanied by an increase in their financialassets amounting to 5
1/C252% between 1997
and 2004. This growth was sustained mainlyby higher cash holdings as well as greaterportfolio investment. One of the motives forthis may have been to build up financial re-serves for future investment projects or to im-prove their negotiating position vis-/C224-vis cred-itors. By contrast, short and long-term recei-vables were reduced by 2
1/C252%. Trade receiva-
bles declined by as much as 141/C252% compared
with the peak of 2000, while trade payablescontracted by an even greater amount. Inboth cases, this is likely to have been aresponse to the economic slowdown and therise in the number of insolvencies, which re-sulted in a lower propensity to grant paymentterms. The reduction in trade receivables wasaccompanied, however, by a marked expan-sion in receivables from affiliated companies.
Overall, the relative weight of financial assets
increased by just under 3 percentage pointsto 44
1/C252%. This means that the SMEs were,
nevertheless, lagging significantly behind thelarge enterprises where financial assets, atthe end of the period under review, account-ed for 63
1/C252% of total assets. The difference is
largely explained by the fact that, in the caseof the larger firms, other long-term equity in-vestments, which amounted to 19% in 2004,
8The sharp growth in leasing over the past few years
suggests that the stock of tangible fixed assets used has
increased considerably more sharply than is recorded in
the balance sheet figures. This is due to the fact that the
vast majority of the leasing companies, on whose balance
sheets the leased machinery and equipment are mostly
recorded, are assigned to the banking industry, which is
not recorded in the Bundesbank’ s corporate balance
sheet statistics.Decline

52were considerably more important than for
SMEs (21/C252%). With a share of 31/C252% in 2004,
investment in securities likewise plays a great-er role in the balance sheets of the large en-terprises.
The structural shifts on the capital side of the
SMEs’ balance sheets were even moremarked than those on the assets side. Moststriking in this context is the sharp increase inequity and the reduction in liabilities. Be-tween 1997 and 2004, SMEs’ equity stockgrew by 150%, which was significantly morethan in the case of the larger enterprises(+53%). This was helped by the fact that,above all, non-corporations among the SMEshad substantially improved on their oftenpoor equity levels in the 1990s. Besides buoy-ant earnings, this may have been due to acertain amount of pressure from the banks toplace more private assets on the balancesheet.
9Corporations’ equity likewise showed
a marked increase during the observationperiod (+85
1/C252%).
Measured by the balance sheet total, SMEs’equity increased overall by 9 percentagepoints to 15% between 1997 and 2004, withthe ratio increasing by 8 percentage points to9% in the case of non-corporations and by10 percentage points to 23
1/C252% in the case of
corporations. Considerable differences re-main across the individual sectors. In 2004,these ranged, for all legal forms, from 6% inconstruction and 6
1/C252% in the retail trade to
21% in manufacturing and 211/C252% in the
wholesale trade. It is striking that the differ-ential between SMEs and large enterprises isdue predominantly to the still much weakercapitalisation of non-corporations, whereasthe relevant ratios of the small and medium-sized corporations and the large corporationsare either more or less equally high (manufac-turing, wholesale trade and transport) or onlyslightly lower (other sectors).Equity as % of balance sheet total

9The proprietor or partner has some accounting discre-
tion as to whether assets are classified as private or busi-
ness assets. For tax reasons, it is therefore more attractive
to record financial assets and real estate as private assets,
for example, owing to the more favourable treatment of
capital gains from sales. However, the liability of propri-
etors of sole proprietorships and at least some of the
partners of partnerships for their firm’s debts ultimately
also extends to their private assets not shown in the bal-
ance sheet. In addition, they often post some of their pri-
vate assets as collateral when procuring business loans.
Conversely, since interest paid on bank loans is tax-
deductible, there is an incentive to locate loans in the
business accounts. This results in the non-corporations’
balance sheets often showing their real financial status
too unfavourably.Sharp increase

53As a mirror image of this, the stock of liabil-
ities declined significantly. One main reasonfor this was the substantial 18
1/C252% net repay-
ment of short and long-term bank loans since1997. Altogether, these accounted for30
1/C252% of the balance sheet total in 2004,
compared with 37% in 1997. Second, in thewake of the shrinkage process in the con-struction industry, there was a decline in pay-ments received on account of orders andtrade payables, both in terms of their amountand in relation to the balance sheet total. Bycontrast, payables to affiliated companiesshowed a slight increase. SMEs’ provisions in-creased by 17% in the observation period,latterly representing just over one-tenth oftotal capital. This is still relatively little, how-ever, when compared with the large enter-prises, whose provisions have a balance sheetshare of 24
1/C252%, mainly on account of high
pension provisions – which have shown a fur-ther sharp rise over the past few years.
Concluding remarks
The profitability and financing situation of
SMEs in Germany improved markedly be-tween 1997 and 2004. This is striking giventhe fact that the quite weak domestic de-mand meant that the overall economic set-ting was rather unfavourable for the general-ly less export-oriented small and medium-sized firms in most of the years in the periodunder study. In this difficult situation, SMEsfocused, first and foremost, on restructuringwith the objective of reducing costs. The sub-stantial gap between SMEs and large enter-prises in terms of both profitability and finan-cing that had existed in the 1990s has sincenarrowed considerably. This applies, in par-ticular, to the corporations among the SMEs,whose annual financial statements, for vari-ous reasons, can be better compared withthose of the large enterprises than can thoseof the non-corporations. What also has to beborne in mind in this analysis, however, isthat very many small and medium-sized firmswith very poor economic ratios disappearedfrom the market during the observationperiod and so are no longer captured statistic-ally.
In 2005, enterprises’ gross profits showed a
further sharp overall rise (see the box onpages 44 and 45). This was accompanied bya further improvement in their equity levels.The SMEs (for which no separate statisticalbreakdown for 2005 is possible at present)are likely to have shared in this development.This is indicated by the fact that domestic de-mand has become a second pillar of econom-ic activity in Germany besides exports.
As the sustainability of the improved profit-
ability and financial situation is by no meansassured yet, there continues to be a need foreconomic policy action. This includes, firstand foremost, a business taxation regimewhich promotes performance and furthermeasures to make the labour market moreflexible. By comparison, the adoption of spe-cific measures to promote small and medium-sized enterprises would appear to be less effi-cient. Indeed, they harbour the risk of intensi-fying distortions in the interplay betweenSMEs and large enterprises and of posing anadditional strain on public finances.

67Transposing the new
Basel capital rules into
German lawThe new Basel II capital rules will begin
to be applied in Germany on 1 January2007. At this time, the relevant EC dir-ectives will be transposed into nationallaw through amendments to the Ger-man Banking Act and the adoption ofa Solvency Regulation. Whereas thecurrent Principle I was oriented toquantitative minimum capital stand-ards, the implementation of Basel IIwill involve the introduction of twoadditional “pillars”: the supervisory re-view process (Pillar II) and disclosurestandards (Pillar III). The more qualita-tive orientation of solvency supervisionin future is reflected by principle-basedstandards that can be applied propor-tionally, flexibly, and with due regardto institutions’ particular risk profile.The minimum capital requirements(Pillar I), especially to cover credit riskand operational risk, have likewisebeen refined more in line with riskorientation and risk adequacy andnow comprise alternative risk measure-ment methods of varying degrees ofcomplexity. It is also in supervisors’interests to pay greater attention tosophisticated elements of banks’ in-ternal risk management methods inthe context of capital regulation or li-quidity monitoring.
In 1988 the Basel Committee on BankingSupervision published, for the first time, aframework agreement on capital require-ments for credit institutions known as the“Basel Accord”. This Accord prescribed, in

68particular, an adequate level of capital back-
ing for loans. A bank’s regulatory capital mustmake up at least 8% of its risk-weightedassets. In 1996 the framework agreementwas extended to include market price risks inthe capital requirements. This led to the fol-lowing formula for prudential minimum cap-ital requirements.
Ownfunds
12:5/C1ðRW A þMRP Þ>/C08%1
The function of capital here is to cover risksthrough its loss-absorbing qualities. Its levellimits the institution’s risk taking.
The capital requirements of the current Basel
Accord (transposed into German law as Prin-ciple I) are restricted to a simple classification(defined by supervisors) of exposures usingonly five different risk weightings (0%, 10%,20%, 50% and 100%). One consequence ofthis is that the regulatory capital charge for aloan does not reflect the individual borrower’sactual default risk since all borrowers in agiven category (eg commercial enterprises)are assigned the same risk weight irrespectiveof their credit rating. The credit institutionthus bears the same capital costs for lendingto a high-quality borrower as it would for aloan to a borrower with a poorer credit rat-ing, even though the default risk is lower inthe first case.
Institutions now have more precise methods
of measuring risk at their disposal. This devel-opment has been taken into account in theRevised Framework
2(“Basel II”) which was
published in 2004. In future, prudential cap-ital requirements will be much more stronglyoriented to the credit rating of individual bor-rowers and thus distinctly more risk-sensitive.
Capital requirements, however, are by them-
selves not enough to completely capture acredit institution’s risk profile. Therefore, twoadditional pillars have been added alongsidethe regulatory capital requirements, whichconstitute Pillar I. Pillar II covers institutions’individual risk profile; banks themselves arerequired to identify their key risks, managetheir levels adequately and back them withcapital. Supervisors will assess the adequacyof these internal risk assessments through areview process. Pillar III embraces market par-ticipants – who, through the institutions’ obli-gation to comply with extended disclosure re-quirements, will be able to form a clearer pic-ture of banks’ soundness than was previouslypossible.
Although the recommendations of the Basel
Committee – and thus the June 2004 frame-work for the new capital requirements forcredit institutions – are not per se legally
binding, they formed the starting point forthe relevant EU directives. Alongside – andclosely based on – the work of the BaselCommittee, the European Commission pre-sented proposals for modernising the Bank-ing Directive and the Capital Adequacy Dir-ective; these have since been adopted by the

are to be implemented by the member statesby the end of 2006. The cited EC directives,moreover, are now sufficiently consistentwith the new Basel capital rules to be regard-ed as equivalent to the latter. In the EU, thiswill mean that Basel II will have been imple-mented for all banks and securities firms fromJanuary 2007. Unlike in the United States,where Basel II will be implemented only part-ly, the EU will experience the positive effectsof the new framework throughout the bank-ing industry.
Ever since work on the new framework
began at European and global level, a closedialogue has been held with the banking sec-tor through several consultation papers inorder to align the new rules closely to real-world banking practice. The new rules will be
transposed into German law through amend-ments to the Banking Act and the adoptionof the Solvency Regulation and the Regula-tion governing large exposures and loans of31.5 million or more (Large Exposures Regula-
tion). Pillars I and III of Basel II will for themost part be incorporated into the SolvencyRegulation, while the qualitative require-ments of Pillar II will be transposed into Ger-man law through the “Minimum require-ments for risk management” (Mindestan-

Amendments to the Banking Act
With the amendments to the Banking Act
(Federal Gazette I, No 53, p 2606 of 22 No-vember 2006), the fundamental prudentialrules of the European directives will havebeen implemented, and the legal basis forthe Solvency Regulation and the Large Expos-ures Regulation will have been created.
In the area of capital requirements, the re-
vised section 10 of the Banking Act now gen-erally governs the capital adequacy require-ments that apply both to single entities andto groups of institutions and financial holdinggroups and also generally defines the eligibil-ity of internal risk measurement systems. Sec-tion 10a of the Banking Act is confined toquestions regarding the definition of consoli-dated groups, the consolidation proceduresand the obligations incumbent on the super-ordinated institutions. The extended cata-logue of capital components listed in theBanking Directive necessitates an even clearerdifferentiation of the definition of capital orown funds in various areas of application. Infuture, “modified available capital” will bethe key indicator for calculating capital ad-equacy pursuant to the Solvency Regulation.Add-ons or deductions resulting from the useof certain calculation methods – eg the valueadjustment excess in the case of institutionsusing an internal ratings-based (IRB) approach(IRB institutions) – will be additionally recog-nised when calculating this “modified avail-able capital”.
The use of internal ratings-based approaches
to calculating a borrower’s risk and thus theinstitutions’ resultant capital requirementscrucially requires corresponding data historiesand thus the collection and use of personaldata. The Banking Directive – without preju-dice to the general provisions relating to theprotection of natural persons when process-ing personal data and to the free movementof data in the European Economic Area (EEA)– therefore expressly recognises a legitimateinterest of the institutions in the collectionand processing of the personal data neces-sary to operate internal ratings-based sys-tems. This, after all, is the only way to ensurethat these systems are operated reliably andthat the results are meaningful. The new sec-tion 10 (1) sentences 3 to 8 of the BankingAct therefore contains specific rules govern-ing the use of personal data in connectionwith such risk measurement methods; thistakes due account of institutions’ and super-visors’ interest in creating and operating such

protecting customers’ legitimate interests.Whereas, when the rating systems are in liveoperation, only features that are demon-strably relevant to creditworthiness after ap-plying strict standards (eg income, assets, em-ployment and payment habits) may be fac-tored into the rating systems, prior to live op-eration features that do not (yet) meet thestrict standards that govern live operationmay also be used for developing and refiningrating systems. Enterprises’ business andtrade secrets are likewise protected.
There are two areas in which the Banking
Directive envisages a considerable easing ofthe requirements for groups of institutionsand financial holding groups. If there is aclose link between the subordinated institu-tions and the superordinated enterprise of agroup of institutions or a financial holdinggroup, in terms of both capital links and riskmanagement aspects, these institutions, pur-suant to section 2a of the Banking Act, maybe exempted from key requirements ofsingle-entity supervision under certain condi-tions. This arrangement enables supervisorsto take due account of banks’ state-of-the-art, inter-institutional risk management pro-cedures. Pursuant to section 10c of the Bank-ing Act, institutions that meet certain condi-tions will be eligible in future to apply a uni-form zero risk weighting to loans within agroup of institutions or financial holdinggroup. A similar arrangement was also madefor institutions that belong to the sameinstitution-related mutual insurance scheme(see box on page 72).How to calculate modified

72Easing of requirements for groups of institutions
Waiver
Pursuant to section 2a of the Banking Act,
institutions domiciled in Germany which
are subordinated to another institution or
a financial holding company also domiciled
in Germany can claim exemption (waiver)
at single-entity level from the requirements
governing capital adequacy, large expo-
sures and the internal control system by no-
tifying the supervisory authorities accord-
ingly. Such exemption requires the subordi-
nated enterprise to be closely integrated in
the group structure. Only in this way can it
be ensured that, by waiving the central
prudential rules at single-entity level, no
risks will arise which could endanger the
safety of the assets entrusted to the institu-
tions or which could impair the orderly con-
duct of banking business or provision of fi-
nancial services or which could result in the
emergence of any unacceptable prudential
loopholes and that an adequate distribu-
tion of capital resources within the group
will be safeguarded. Thus, an institution
may only claim exemption if the superordi-
nated enterprise exercises a controlling in-
fluence on the subordinated enterprise.
Furthermore, the subordinated enterprise
must be fully integrated in the group-wide
risk assessment, measurement and monitor-
ing procedures and the superordinated en-
terprise must ensure that the subordinated
enterprise is managed in line with the pru-
dential requirements. This exemption can
also be claimed by the superordinated en-
terprises of a group of institutions or a fi-
nancial holding group if they meet the
aforementioned requirements.Intra-group exposures
Pursuant to section 10c of the Banking Act,
loans within a group of institutions or a fi-
nancial holding group may be given a zero
risk weighting for Solvency Regulation pur-
poses provided that they are not assigned
to the debtor’s own funds (intra-group ex-
posures). Furthermore, both the creditor
and the debtor of the loan must be domi-
ciled in Germany and must be included in
both the full consolidation and the group’s
risk management system. Finally, there
must be no obstacles to the loan’s repay-
ment. This relaxation of the rules also ap-
plies to lending between credit institutions
which belong to the same institution-based
mutual insurance schemes. However, since
the requirements of inclusion of the mem-
ber institutions in the full consolidation of
the superordinated institution and in the
group-wide risk management system are
applicable to groups of institutions and
financial holding groups only, these
institution-based mutual insurance schemes
are therefore subject to special terms and
conditions. Key stipulations in this respect
are the existence of a liability covenant laid
down in a contract or statute to avert insol-
vencies, appropriate arrangements for
monitoring risks and credit defaults as well
as the avoidance of multiple use or inap-
propriate drawing of own funds within the
network of institutions. The institutions
must provide adequate documentation to
show that they have met the requirements.
The supervisory authorities are currently
holding intensive discussions with the asso-
ciations of institutions concerned to deter-
mine the extent to which the individual re-
quirements have been met.

73The risk management requirements in section
25a of the Banking Act were adapted suchthat an appropriate risk management systembased on methods of gauging and safeguard-ing risk-bearing capacity include the defin-ition of strategies and the establishment ofinternal control mechanisms (internal controlsystem and internal audit function). In add-ition, the fundamental business organisationrequirements expressly include regular re-views of the adequacy of the business organ-isation and its adaptation to changed condi-tions. Not only the power to issue orders pur-suant to section 25a of the Banking Act butalso section 45b of the Banking Act givesupervisors further scope for taking action toremedy organisational deficiencies affectingan institution, a group of institutions or a fi-nancial holding group. These include stiffercapital requirements, imposing restrictions onbusiness activity or ordering targeted meas-ures to reduce risk.
Furthermore, in implementing Pillar III of the
Revised Framework, section 26a of the Bank-ing Act imposes a series of disclosure require-ments in connection with the use of internalrisk measurement procedures for calculatinginstitutions’ capital requirements. Whereasthe specific disclosure events are largely regu-lated by the Solvency Regulation, section 26agoverns general issues concerning the con-tent of disclosure requirements, organisation-al requirements and exceptions. In the area ofdisclosure, too, supervisors have the power toissue specific orders to remedy organisationaldeficiencies or deficiencies in disclosure prac-tices.It was necessary to amend the large exposure
provisions in order to extend the scope forgreater recognition of credit risk mitigationprovisions contained in the new solvencyrules to large exposures. The aim is to createmaximum consistency between the two regu-latory areas with regard to credit risk mitiga-tion rules (see the section on the Large Expos-ures Regulation). Moreover, it was necessaryto introduce exceptions for energy trading soas not to unduly impede the economicallyand politically important goal of liberalisingthe markets for gas and electricity. Pursuantto section 20c of the Banking Act, the exist-ing concentration risks for energy trading,which also need to be hedged, are, no longerto be limited via prudential quantification,but instead to be measured and managed in-dividually by energy traders using internallydeveloped procedures.
With the new section 1a of the Banking Act,
there is now a separate provision devoted tothe requirements relating to holding a tradingbook, superseding the current section 1 (12)of the Banking Act which governs the distinc-tion between the trading book and the bank-ing book. This was necessitated by the needto take account of the extended rules ontrading book business adopted in the newCapital Adequacy Directive. The recast Cap-ital Adequacy Directive now includes moreextensive qualitative provisions on holding atrading book, on trading strategies and onthe valuation of trading book positions. Sincethese provisions are specifically tailored to theholding of a trading book, they were not in-cluded in the general rules on risk manage-ment set out in section 25a of the Banking

74Act but instead under the rules governing the
trading book. All the same, institutions areequally free to implement these rules in thecontext of their general risk management sys-tem. The requirements governing the tradingbook also contain provisions relating tobanks’ internal hedging practices. At thesame time, section 1a (3) of the Banking Actredefines financial instruments for the pur-poses of the act. In future, for the purpose ofmonitoring solvency, reference will no longerbe made to the “financial instrument” con-cept as defined in the Investment Services Dir-ective or the Financial Markets Directive,which is relevant for the approval require-ment for trading in financial instruments, butinstead to the broader definition contained inthe Capital Adequacy Directive. A financial in-strument is said to exist if a contract results inone party having a financial asset and theother having a financial liability or equity in-strument. Institutions engaged in only very lit-tle trading in financial instruments (ie the sumtotal of their trading book positions is gener-ally less than 315 million; see section 2 (11) of
the Banking Act), however, are exempt fromthese requirements.
Now that institutions are increasingly en-
gaging in banking business across bordersand providing financial services in other EEAmember states, the rules for cooperationamong supervisory agencies (sections 8 etseq of the Banking Act) have been revised toaddress these changes in market practices.Moreover, a trend towards creating central-ised risk management systems is noticeableamong internationally active groups of insti-tutions and financial holding groups. Againstthis background, it has to be ensured that alicence granted by the country of domicilecan be recognised throughout the EEA andthat competition between institutions domi-ciled in different member states is not distort-ed by differences in supervisory standards.For that reason, convergence of supervisorypractices in the EU is one of the key goals ofthe revised Banking Directive.
One central issue here is the goal of further
strengthening the position of the agency re-sponsible for supervising the consolidated in-stitution (the “consolidating supervisor”), asthis agency will have an increased role in co-ordinating the supervision of internationallyactive groups whose members are domiciledin more than one member state. The provi-sions in section 10 (1a) of the Banking Act onallowing internationally active groups of insti-tutions and financial holding groups to use in-ternal measurement models accordingly em-phasises the special significance of the super-visory authority responsible for consolidatedsupervision. This provision, however, also en-sures that all responsible agencies in otherEEA member states are fully involved in theapproval procedure. In a continuation of theintensified cooperation between the variousagencies responsible for supervising thegroup’s member institutions expressed in sec-tions 8 et seq of the Banking Act, the consoli-dating supervisor does not decide unilaterallyon applications for approval of internal meas-urement models in a group. Instead, the ap-plication is forwarded to the other respon-sible agencies, provided the institutions theysupervise are affected by the application forgroup approval. Upon receipt of the full appli-

75cation, the responsible agencies have six
months to reach a joint decision on whetherthe conditions for approval are met. Shouldthe agencies involved fail to reach a joint de-cision within that time, the consolidatingsupervisor has the right to take the final deci-sion.
In place of the aggregation of single-entity fi-
nancial statements which had previouslybeen required by supervisors for all groups ofinstitutions and financial holding groups, nowconsolidated statements drawn up undercommercial law can be used as the basis forcalculating consolidated capital adequacy.Use of the consolidated financial statementsto calculate consolidated capital adequacymust be based, however, on the respectiveprudentially defined consolidated group, iefirms that are included in the consolidated fi-nancial statements under commercial law yetare not part of the consolidated group forprudential purposes need to be eliminatedfrom the consolidated group. Conversely, theexposures of enterprises that belong to theprudentially defined consolidated group yetare not included in the consolidated financialstatements under commercial law are to beassigned to the consolidated own funds andrisk positions. Additional provisions (“pruden-tial filters”) designed to correct certain valu-ation rules in the International AccountingStandards (IAS/IFRS) will be included in theConsolidated Financial Statement TransitionRegulation (Konzernabschluss/C252berleitungs-
verordnung).Solvency Regulation
The Solvency Regulation replaces the previous
Principle I and spells out the details of the ad-equacy of institutions’ own funds demandedby section 10 of the Banking Act. The Solv-ency Regulation is scheduled to come into ef-fect on 1 January 2007. For a one-year transi-tional period, institutions will be able to con-tinue calculating their capital requirementscompletely on the basis of Principle I.
New methods of calculating credit riskPrinciple I had hitherto envisaged only a
standardised procedure for calculating theadequacy of the capital backing of credit riskpositions. It contained a rigid creditworthi-ness weighting schema for determining riskwhich was categorised by type of borrowersand (with regard to sovereigns and banks asdebtors) made a relatively simplistic distinc-tion between OECD and non-OECD states.No consideration was given to individual bor-rowers’ probabilities of default. This proced-ure has been replaced in the Solvency Regula-tion by two alternative approaches.
One of these is for institutions to apply a new
Credit Risk Standardised Approach (CRSA), inwhich the risk weighting is usually linked toexternal credit assessments.
5External credit
assessments may be used only if they comefrom institutions that are recognised bysupervisors (see box on page 76).

tutions may eschew external credit assessments in favour

76Recognition of external credit assessment institutions for risk weighting purposes
in the Credit Risk Standardised Approach
Before an institution is granted permission
to use the credit ratings issued by an exter-
nal credit assessment institution (ECAI) to
measure the risk weights of credit risk pos-
itions in the Credit Risk Standardised Ap-
proach (CRSA), the ECAI first needs super-
visory approval. Such approval may be
granted only if the credit assessment meth-
odology applied by the ECAI and the result-
ing credit ratings meet certain require-
ments.
The credit assessment methodology is gov-
erned by the following requirements.
– Objectivity, especially including a sys-
tematic structure which can be valid-
ated.
– Independence from political or econom-
ic pressures.
– The issued credit assessments should be
subject to at least an annual review.
– Transparency (ie the documentation of
the general methodology should bepublicly available).
The resultant credit assessments must be
– recognised in the markets by the users
of these assessments as credible and reli-
able, and
– transparent in the sense that they are
available at least to all institutions thathave a legitimate interest at equivalent
terms.The application for ECAI recognition for
risk weighting purposes has to be lodged
by the ECAI itself. This is also to include a
declaration of intent by an institution or a
central association of the banking industry
on the future use of the ECAI’s assessments
for the purposes of the Solvency Regula-
tion. BaFin and the Bundesbank then joint-
ly examine whether the requirements have
been met. If the ECAI is also seeking recog-
nition in other European Union member
states, a “joint assessment process” is con-
ducted by the supervisory authorities of the
EU member states involved. The existence
of a single main point of contact, joint
evaluation and agreement between all par-
ticipating supervisory authorities regarding
the joint assessment of the application are
all intended to ensure a consistent decision
on the application across member states
while also reducing the bureaucracy this
involves for the applicant. The decision
on the recognition of ECAIs is then taken
by each responsible national supervisory
authority.
Within the framework of the recognition
procedure, BaFin and the Bundesbank then
assign each credit assessment category used
by the applicant ECAI to a supervisory
credit rating grade between 1 and 6 from
which the risk weights to be used can then
be derived. The long-term default rates of
the credit assessment categories, but also
qualitative factors such as portfolio com-
position and the ECAI’s default definition,
are included in the assignment.

77Depending on their external credit assess-
ment, the risk exposures that have to be as-signed to certain asset classes are given indi-vidualised risk weights.
6For unrated expos-
ures or certain loans, such as those granted inretail or mortgage business, by contrast, thepractice of assigning a uniform fixed riskweight will continue to apply. Retail expos-ures will benefit in future from particularly fa-vourable treatment, as the new CRSA ruleswill only require them to be given a 75% riskweight (as against 100% in Principle I). This isadvantageous particularly for the medium-sized business sector, as the retail businessasset class generally also covers small andmedium-sized enterprises up to an overall in-debtedness level of 31 million. The risk
weight for claims secured by residential realestate property will be reduced from 50% to35%. These rules are likely to favour, in par-ticular, smaller and medium-sized banks thatfocus mainly on retail banking business.
In a departure from the general coupling of
risk weights to issue or issuer credit ratings,the risk weight for claims on banks dependson the external credit assessment of thecountry of domicile. Because few smaller andmedium-sized institutions have an externalcredit assessment, a corresponding option inthe Banking Directive is being exercised in thenational implementation.
For the first time, institutions have been given
a further option for calculating the regulatorycapital charges for credit risk – that of using amore risk-sensitive approach based on theirown rating procedures, also known as the in-ternal ratings-based (IRB) approach, in whichthe credit risk weights are determined using
borrower-based risk parameters. Institutionscan choose between a Foundation Approach(in which the institution only has to estimatethe borrower’s probability of default (PD)) andan Advanced Approach (in which the institu-tion calculates not only PD but also loss givendefault (LGD), conversion factors for off-balance-sheet business and residual matur-ities). The risk weights are calculated for indi-vidual risk exposures using an IRB approachbased on individually estimated parametersand classified by given asset classes, using riskweighting formulas.
Here, too, some components of the rules are
“SME-friendly”: as in the CRSA, SMEs can beassigned to the retail business asset class,thus subjecting them to lower risk weightsthan for the corporates asset class. However,if SMEs are counted as corporates owing tohigher total indebtedness, they are also eli-gible for “haircuts” in capital requirementsdepending on the amount of turnover andthus on enterprise size.
Since the institutions themselves estimate the
risk parameters in the IRB approaches, super-visory approval, which can be given based onan on-site inspection, is necessary prior to theuse of these approaches. In this procedure,supervisors’ examinations focus on an institu-tion’s compliance with the strict catalogue ofminimum requirements. During an implemen-tation phase, which generally lasts five years,an institution is permitted to use, to a certaindegree, the CRSA alongside the IRB approach

78(“temporary partial use”); for some expos-
ures, there is no time limit on this option (alsoknown as “permanent partial use”).
In order to calculate the credit equivalent
amounts of risk exposures in derivatives,there will be two new procedures in future inaddition to the original exposure method andthe mark-to-market methods: the Standard-ised Method (SM) and the Internal ModelMethod (IMM). The SM could also be referredto as a standardised IMM, as it includes coreelements of the IMM and thus reflects creditrisks much more accurately than previousmethods; however, it is less difficult for insti-tutions to implement. In the IMM, creditequivalent amounts are calculated using aninternal risk model that assesses the disper-sion of future positive market values of de-rivatives based on modelled market pricemovements. The IMM may also be used tocalculate assessment bases for counterpartycredit risk arising from non-derivative transac-tions with collateral margin calls as well asrisks arising from other repurchase transac-tions and securities or commodities lendingor borrowing transactions, which otherwise,would have to be counted as balance sheetor off-balance sheet transactions regardingtheir counterparty credit risk. Since institu-tions have considerable discretion whenusing the IMM, this method, unlike the otherprocedures, may only be used upon approvalby supervisors.

79Fundamental revision of rules governing
credit risk mitigation techniques
Under the capital adequacy provisions, insti-
tutions used to have only very limited scopefor recognising collateral for credit risk miti-gation purposes (in most cases, only collateralfrom collateral providers with a risk weightingof 0% or 20% provided institutions with cap-ital relief). The Solvency Regulation representsa fundamental revision of the rules for creditrisk mitigation techniques.
In future, institutions using IRB will be
allowed to use not only a much larger rangeof eligible financial collateral for credit riskmitigation purposes, which will include awide range of potential collateral instrumentsup to and including equities, mutual fundshares or also life insurance policies, but alsoassignments of claims or physical collateral.When using advanced IRB approaches, therange of eligible collateral is even completelyunrestricted, provided an institution canpresent reliable estimates of the asset’s intrin-sic value. When collateralising securitisationexposures, the rules on credit risk mitigationtechniques apply accordingly.
The recognition of mortgages and warranties
as eligible collateral has been maintained.Under the rules for warranties, the treatmentof credit derivatives will likewise be compre-hensively regulated by the Solvency Regula-tion. For credit risk mitigation techniques tobe recognised when calculating minimumcapital requirements, however, institutionsneed to comply with certain minimum quali-tative requirements which are explicitly speci-
fied in the Solvency Regulation.
The provisions governing contractual netting
have also been fundamentally rewritten. Pre-viously, institutions could only recognise net-ting effects in the case of credit risk exposuresfrom derivatives and, separately, in the caseof repurchase transactions and securities orcommodities lending or borrowing transac-tions in the trading book for credit risk mitiga-tion purposes. On condition that the institu-tion has concluded a bilateral eligible nettingagreement, the use of on-balance sheet net-ting (the netting of mutual money claims anddebts) will also be permitted in future. More-over, institutions, via eligible cross-productnetting agreements, will also be able to takeaccount of netting effects in the case of riskexposures from non-derivative transactionswith collateral margin calls, other repurchasetransactions and securities or commoditieslending or borrowing transactions and deriva-tives, for risk mitigation purposes. However,for such cross-product netting agreements,the use of IMM is mandatory.
New rules governing securitisationsHitherto the treatment of many securitisation
transactions has been agreed with supervisorson a case-by-case basis. With the adoption ofthe Banking Directive’s securitisation provi-sions in the Solvency Regulation, comprehen-sive rules have now been introduced for thecapital backing of securitisation exposuresand conditions created for the originators ofsecuritisation transactions to claim regulatorycapital relief. When determining the securi-

80tisation risk weight, a distinction is made be-
tween CRSA and IRB securitisation transac-tions. The classification of a securitisationtransaction as a CRSA or IRB securitisationtransaction is determined by the credit riskapproach that governs the type of assetbeing securitised (CRSA or IRB). Mixed port-folios are classified according to whetherCRSA or IRB positions are predominant in thesecuritised portfolio.
Any external ratings that exist for CRSA se-
curitisation transactions are the key criterionfor the securitisation risk weight. Unrated se-curitisation exposures are always to be givena weighting of 1,250% or deducted from li-able capital. Exceptions are envisaged forqualified liquidity facilities, second loss pos-itions in asset-backed commercial paper(ABCP) programmes and in cases in whichthe average risk weighting of the securitisedportfolio can be calculated owing to a trans-parent portfolio composition.
A hierarchy of approaches is envisaged for
IRB securitisation transactions. If a securitisa-tion position has been given an external rat-ing, or if the rating can be inferred froma benchmark securitisation position, theRatings-Based Approach (RBA) is to be used.Otherwise, it is to be examined whether thesecuritisation risk weight can be calculatedusing the Supervisory Formula (SF) approach.For certain securitisation exposures in thecontext of ABCP programmes, upon applica-tion and supervisory approval, banks may usean internal assessment approach to calculatethe credit rating, and thus the securitisation

securitisation exposures to which none of theaforementioned procedures are applicableare to be either given a risk weighting of1,250% or deducted from liable capital. Inexceptional cases, there is a “fallback” solu-tion for qualified securitisation liquidity facil-ities – which is subject to revocation by super-visors – according to which the highest CRSArisk weight in the securitised portfolio can beapplied in order to prevent the deductionfrom capital or a 1,250% risk weighting.
Additional capital requirement for
operational risk
To date, “other” risks, chief among which are
operational risks, were covered by a flat-ratesolvency coefficient of 8%. However, since, infuture, the regulatory capital requirement for
credit risk will be calculated with much great-er precision, the explicit capital backing of op-erational risks is envisaged. Three differentcalculation methods are provided for by theSolvency Regulation.
– Basic Indicator Approach (BIA)– Standardised Approach (TSA)– Advanced Measurement Approaches
(AMAs)
The calculation basis for the BIA and TSA is
the three-year average of the “relevant indi-cator”, which is to be calculated from certainitems in the profit and loss account (net inter-est and net commissions received, the tradingDeutsche BundesbankCalculating the credit risk mitigation effects from netting agreements

82result and other operating income). When
using the BIA, multiplying the “relevant indi-cator” across the board by 15% produces thecapital charge. In order to calculate the cap-ital charge using the TSA, the “relevant indi-cator” is to be broken down into eight busi-ness lines defined in the Solvency Regulationand multiplied by weights ranging between12% and 18%. Alternatively, an institutionthat is involved primarily in retail and corpor-ate business, when using the TSA, may, sub-ject to prior approval by supervisors, calculatethe capital charge in these business lines bymultiplying the nominal credit volume by aprudential factor of 0.035.
If an institution has been given permission by
supervisors to use an AMA, it may, in compli-ance with qualitative and quantitative super-visory standards, use its own model to calcu-late its capital requirements. This is precededby an approval examination performed bysupervisors.

The market risk rules in Principle I – with the
exception of necessary systematic adjust-ments to the new credit risk rules – will be in-corporated into the Solvency Regulationlargely unchanged in the course of the Basel IIimplementation process.

New disclosure requirements
The new disclosure requirements envisaged in
Pillar III of the Basel II framework and the re-cast EC directives were included in the Solv-ency Regulation because of their close rela-tionship with capital rules. Disclosure obliga-tions are generally aimed at the financialgroup level; entities belonging to groups arenot individually subject to disclosure require-ments.
Institutions or superordinated institutions are
required to publish the necessary informationannually, and at least semiannually in thecase of internationally active institutions, in asuitable medium (eg on the company’s ownwebsite), unless disclosure has already beeneffected in the context of fulfilling other pub-lication requirements. Disclosure primarilycovers information on risk management relat-ing to risk areas, capital structure, capital ad-equacy and detailed information on counter-party credit risk, market risk and operationalrisk, securitisations, credit risk mitigationtechniques, interest rate risk in the bankingbook and equity holdings in the bankingbook.
Regulation governing large exposures
and loans of 51.5 million or more
(Large Exposures Regulation)
The definition of the concept of risk for large
exposures in the Banking Directive is basedon the solvency rules. However, the riskweights are generally not to be used, sincethe sole purpose of these weights and de-grees of risk is to calculate the general solv-ency requirement for the capital backing ofcredit risk. In order to limit the maximum lossrisk of a credit institution with respect to asingle customer or a group of affiliated cus-tomers, the nominal value of the exposures,without applying weights or risk grades, is tobe used as the basis for defining large expos-ures. However, the effects of credit risk miti-gation techniques can be recognised similarlyto those relating to the calculation of min-imum capital requirements. Accordingly,when recasting the Large Exposures Regula-tion, the Standardised Method and the In-ternal Model Method needed to be intro-duced in order to calculate the assessmentbase for derivative transactions, and rulesgoverning credit risk mitigation techniquesneeded to be incorporated.

84With regard to the recognition of credit risk
mitigation techniques in the large exposurerules, supervisors may give institutions revoc-able permission, upon prior application, torecognise the eligible financial collateral pur-suant to the Solvency Regulation at itsvolatility-adjusted value, ie to use the creditamount adjusted for the level of financial col-lateral instead of the credit amount calcu-lated pursuant to the general provisions ofthe Large Exposures Regulation. Moreover, in-stitutions using the IRB approach can recog-nise the collateral effect of financial collateralwhen calculating credit amounts providedthey are permitted to make their own esti-mates of the loss given default (LGD) and IRBconversion factor parameters for a givenasset class and, when doing so, can reliablyassess the effects of financial collateral ontheir credit risks irrespective of other aspectsthat are relevant to LGD.
8Here, institutions
are required to proceed in a manner consist-ent with the approach they use to calculatetheir capital requirements. In addition, institu-tions may recognise financial collateral, war-ranties (including credit derivatives) and trad-ing book collateral for reporting purposes orfor calculating capital charges provided thatthey meet certain standards regarding thevaluation of this collateral and the manage-ment of the risks associated with this collat-eral, which are spelled out in the Regulation.
Liquidity Regulation
Even though no material connection exists,
Principle II will be transformed into a LiquidityRegulation pursuant to section 11 of theBanking Act simultaneously with the imple-mentation of Basel II.
The Liquidity Regulation will modernise the
quantitative liquidity rules by creating a morerisk-oriented and principles-based prudentialsupervisory regime. From 2007, institutionshave been given, for the first time, the oppor-tunity to use their own risk measurement andrisk management procedures for the pruden-tial limitation of liquidity risk, subject to priorapproval by supervisors. Such an individual-ised procedure must meet stringent require-ments, compliance with which is assessed bysupervisors in an approval examination. Forinstitutions that do not use their own proced-ures, the Liquidity Regulation represents hard-ly any change from current practice, since theexisting rules of Principle II will be incorpor-ated into the regulation largely unchanged asthe “Standardised Approach”.
Institutions temporarily using Principle I dur-
ing the year 2007 will be able to simultan-eously use Principle II instead of the new Li-quidity Regulation until 1 January 2008.
8For the calculation, the credit amounts are to be multi-
plied by the LGD adjustment factor, calculated as the dif-
ference between one and the quotient of the self-
estimated LGD that would arise for this loan if the finan-
cial collateral were recognised and of the self-estimated
LGD for this loan without recognising the available finan-

85The qualitative elements of the Basel
Pillar II in the “Minimum requirementsfor risk management”
The “Minimum requirements for risk man-
agement” (MaRisk),
9published on 20 De-
cember 2005, flesh out section 25a (1) of theBanking Act, which calls for adequate riskmanagement. These minimum requirementscover the qualitative requirements of Pillar IIof the Basel framework. MaRisk stand for aprinciples-based approach and serve to imple-ment the principle of dual proportionality setforth in the Supervisory Review Process (SRP)enshrined in articles 22, 123 and 124 of theBanking Directive. On the basis of numerousescape clauses, MaRisk can be applied in asimplified manner depending on the credit in-stitutions’ size, business speciality and risksituation.
The qualitative elements of the Internal Cap-
ital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP)contained in Pillar II of Basel have been fac-tored into MaRisk. For instance, requirementsgoverning risk-bearing capacity (AT 4.1
10)
were introduced, and three new risk categor-ies were added to the requirements for therisk management and risk controlling processalongside the counterparty and market pricerisks in the trading book already regulated bythe “Minimum requirements for the creditbusiness of credit institutions” and the “Min-imum requirements for the trading businessof credit institutions”: interest rate risks in thebanking book (BT R 2.3, “Market price risksin the banking book”), liquidity risks (BT R 3)and operational risks (BT R 4). However,MaRisk do not include rules on interest rateshocks,
11as this is a quantitative element of
the SRP .
BaFin and the Bundesbank are currently
working together on revising prudential rulesrelating to outsourcing with a view to inte-grating them into MaRisk. In a similar mannerto the “Minimum requirements for the trad-ing activities of credit institutions”, the ob-jective in this field is to modernise and reducethe volume of rules in a principles-based,real-world manner. The rules in the Marketsin Financial Instruments Directive 2004/39/EC
12and the implementing Commission Dir-
ective 2006/73/EC, as well as the CEBS’sGuidelines on Outsourcing, which will shortlybe published, need to be taken into account,which means that rules on outsourcing willthen apply both in the banking sector andthe securities sector.

end of 2005, credit institutions have alreadybeen eligible to make use of the relief anddiscretionary scope afforded by the new rulescompared with the earlier “Minimum require-

Solvency reporting system harmonisedthroughout the EU (“COREP”)
A new path is being embarked upon in the
reporting system with the advent of an EU-wide harmonised solvency reporting system(Common Reporting, or COREP) developed atthe level of the Committee of EuropeanBanking Supervisors (CEBS). In the past, thesolvency reporting system, which was basedon the Banking Act and Principle I, had beendeveloped by supervisors at the nationallevel. Now, the structure of the COREP re-porting system has been imported into theSolvency Regulation completely. Supervisors,however, still have national discretion regard-ing the amount of detail in the specific infor-mation to be provided by institutions.

87supervisory aim of making the reporting sys-
tem as streamlined as possible.
In future, institutions and superordinated in-
stitutions will have to submit solvency reportsto supervisors no longer monthly, as in thepast, but only on a quarterly basis, therebypartly alleviating their reporting obligations.In addition, according to the new rules, sub-mission deadlines for single-entity reports willbe extended in institutions’ favour: from end-March 2007, these reports will be due nolonger on the 5th business day, but insteadthe 15th business day, after the end of thepreceding month. Reports for groups of insti-tutions and financial holding groups, how-ever, will continue to be due within onemonth after the reporting date.
Outlook
With the publication of the new German
Banking Act on 22 November 2006, and ofthe Solvency Regulation and the amendedLarge Exposures Regulation in December2006 in the Federal Gazette, work on thelegal implementation of the recast EC direct-ives has been completed. What will be theimpact of the new rules, and what still needsto be done?
First and foremost, expert implementation
cannot be described as complete: the twoGerman supervisory agencies, BaFin and theBundesbank, along with those institutionsthat have applied for permission to use ad-vanced risk measurement approaches, are stillin the process of issuing IRB and AMA ap-proval. This process is likely to take some timeyet – not least owing to the generous rulesgoverning the gradual transition to moreadvaced risk measurement approaches,under which banks can apply for initial ap-proval at institution level or for approval forindividual, additional rating systems evenyears later. With regard to Pillar I of the newcapital framework, therefore, the conclusionof regulatory implementation should be re-garded more as reaching an (important) mile-stone rather than as having crossed the fin-ishing line of all implementation work.
Upon completion of the legal implementa-
tion, a Basel Committee working groupchaired by the Bundesbank will address theissue of monitoring the capital requirementsunder the new capital adequacy regime. Thismonitoring is designed to ensure that theaims of the Basel Committee – to create cap-ital incentives for using more advanced riskmeasurement approaches while at the sametime preserving capital in the overall system –are achieved. The Basel II capital requirementsare calibrated such that, in Germany, they willlead to slight capital reductions of around 5%in the new CRSA and to somewhat largercapital reductions of around 8% in the IRBApproach. Thus, the correct incentives havebeen set for transitioning to more risk-sensitive approaches. Depending on the out-come of monitoring, however, a future recali-bration of the Basel risk weighting functionscannot be ruled out.
Expert work will also continue on Pillar II, im-
plemented in Germany as MaRisk. The ICAAPrequirements represent a journey into un-

88charted waters in Germany. The evolution of
banks’ internal methodologies is very dynam-ic and has not yet reached the end. In this en-vironment, the specific prudential supervisoryrequirements for ICAAP , in terms of what is“feasible” today, will require some time totake on a specific shape, depending on thesize and complexity of the institutions. In add-ition, as institutions make advances in theirmethodologies, this shape will evolve overtime.
Furthermore, in ICAAP , present-day national
requirements for integrated risk managementintermingle with future regulatory ideas. Inlong-term preparation for the potential futureprudential recognition of credit risk models,the Risk Modelling and Management Group(RMMG) of the Basel Committee has alreadybegun to analyse and evaluate the status
quo of modelling and its integration into
models of economic capital. In the shortterm, its results could give a valuable impetusto ICAAP , as it is precisely these internal creditand capital models which form the core ofICAAP among the more advanced institu-tions, even though they are not prudentiallymandatory.
Moreover, banking supervisors will set to
work on revising the current regulatory defin-ition of capital and on developing inter-national standards for measuring and moni-toring liquidity risk. In the latter project, BaFinand the Bundesbank will raise the issue ofrecognising banks’ internal liquidity riskmodels for prudential purposes for discussionat international level.
On the whole, the process launched with
Basel II of allowing advanced institutions touse modern internal risk measurement sys-tems for more and more types of risks andrisk systems while at the same time providingstandardised prudential methods for less ad-vanced institutions will be continued. This willenable institutions to proactively choose a de-gree of complexity for their own risk meas-urement and risk management systemswhich is the best fit for them and their par-ticular business structure.

89Recent developments
in payment cards and
innovative electronic
payment proceduresThe cashless payments landscape in
Germany today is still shaped by thepredominance of traditional paymentinstruments, namely credit transferand direct debit. Nevertheless, in re-cent years the significance of card pay-ments has grown considerably. Influ-enced by technological advances andthe possibilities offered by the inter-net, various forms of electronic pay-ment procedures have also emerged.At the forefront are access proceduresto payment instruments with author-isation via mobile telephone, landlineor internet and recent developmentsin electronic money. Moreover, advan-cing European integration is proving adriving force behind structural changesin the EU payments environment, espe-cially in the card market. The Bundes-bank is monitoring the efficiency andsecurity of these developments as partof its statutory responsibility for cash-less payments. The aim of this article isto highlight new trends, drawing at-tention to special aspects of security,standardisation and regulation.
Trends in payment procedures in Germany
Even though credit transfers and direct debits
still dominate the cashless payment scene inGermany, payment cards, which now accountfor 15% of transactions, have become anestablished payment instrument.

90The German card market is characterised by
debit cards, which are generally directlylinked to the cardholder’s bank account.When a card payment is made, this results inan immediate debit to the account. In 2005,approximately 91.6 million debit cards werein circulation in Germany. These were almostentirely cards issued by German credit institu-tions for the electronic cash card paymentscheme. In this scheme – developed by theGerman banking industry – the payment isguaranteed by the card-issuing bank follow-ing successful authorisation, which includes acover and validity check. For security reasons,the customer proves his identity during thepayment transaction using his personal iden-tification number (PIN). Debit cards can beused to withdraw cash from automated tellermachines (ATMs) and to pay at electronicpayment terminals. A total of roughly 53,000ATMs and 570,000 payment terminals wereavailable in 2005. In Germany, debit cardscan also be used to generate electronic directdebits.

The number of card payments in the retailsector is rapidly increasing. In the past fewyears, there has been substantial growth inelectronic cash. This is due in part to the deci-sion by large discount chains to accept elec-tronic cash cards. It is also probable that,given the risk of fraud, merchants are nowplacing increasing importance on the pay-ment guarantee provided by electronic cash.The EHI Retail Institute
2has established that
card payments in the retail sector rose fromroughly 6.2% of turnover in 1994 to approxi-mately 32.9% in 2005. Debit cards wereused for 26.9% of the retail turnover in2005, while credit cards accounted for only5%. Of the payments made by debit card,unguaranteed payments (eg electronic directdebits) were slightly more common at 15.4%of retail turnover.

A distinction is to be made between creditcards with monthly payment of the cumula-tive card transactions and those with a creditfunction. The latter are equipped with a spe-cific credit facility, which is independent of anoverdraft facility on the giro account. Theroughly 21 million credit cards issued in Ger-many are used far less often than debit cards.This is due partly to the higher charges forthe card holder and the merchant. In add-ition, the low usage of revolving credits pro-vided by the cards is likely to be the routinelyhigher interest charged in comparison withpersonal credit lines on giro accounts. A re-cent development in the German market in-volves credit cards allocated to a specific card
account which is invariably maintained on acredit-balance basis. In some cases, the cardaccount may be topped up. Like gift cards,these credit-balance-based cards are usuallyoffered to a specific target group.
The growing use of the internet to purchase
goods and services is also reflected in pay-ments. The vast majority of purchases madeon the internet are settled using traditionalpayment procedures, for example, directdebit or credit card. Alongside payment ondelivery, credit transfers – for instance, as ad-vance payment or upon receipt of invoice –continue to play a significant role.

92doubtedly due in part to the increasing popu-
larity of online banking. At the end of 2005,there were approximately 33.3 million onlineaccounts in Germany while in 2001 the figurewas 19.1 million. Roughly 1.1 billion credittransfers in 2005 were initiated via the inter-net (compared with approximately 0.5 billionin 2001).
Payment procedures which allow the secure,
comfortable and efficient payment of goodsand services without the exchange of datamedia hold particular potential for electronictrade. Thus, in February 2006 a large sectionof the German banking industry introducedGiropay,
4an online banking portal designed
specifically for payment transactions on theinternet. According to Giropay, it can be usedby roughly 17 million online banking custom-ers at participating banks in Germany. At theend of a purchase transaction on the internet,the customer is redirected within Giropaystraight to his bank’s website where he au-thorises a fully prepared credit transfer order.Once the customer has authorised his bankto make the payment, the merchant receivesdirect confirmation and payment guaranteefrom the customer’s bank.
Providers of internet-based billing procedures
enable the collection of payment amountsoccurring in connection with internet transac-tions. Authorisation may be made using, forexample, passwords (following registration)or transaction numbers transmitted via mo-bile telephone. Billing procedures consolidatethe individual amounts into a single transac-tion sum. This is then collected either at regu-lar intervals (for example, once a month) oronce a certain minimum amount has beenreached. Collection is generally made usingtraditional payment instruments, such as dir-ect debit or credit card. Providers with anexisting business relationship with the cus-tomer (for instance telecommunication com-panies) add the accrued payment sums to thecustomer’s monthly invoice. Owing to the ag-gregation of individual transactions, billingprocedures are very efficient especially forsmall payment amounts.
Pursuant to the Electronic Money Directive
(2000/46/EC) from the year 2000, e-moneyconstitutes a monetary value as representedby a claim on the issuer which is stored on anelectronic device. E-money is issued on re-ceipt of an amount that is not less in valuethan the stored monetary value. Another de-fining feature is that the stored e-money isaccepted as a means of payment by under-takings other than the issuer. A licence
5from
the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority(BaFin) is required in order to issue e-moneyin Germany. A distinction can be made be-tween various forms of e-money according tothe different storage devices – card or server.
In the case of card-based e-money, the mon-
etary value is stored directly on the card – asis the case for the “GeldKarte” of the CentralCredit Committee (CCC) in Germany. TheGeldKarte function is usually integrated intothe bank card in addition to the debit func-tion. At the end of 2005, over 64 millionGeldKarte cards were in issue and 172,000

93merchant terminals were equipped for pay-
ment by GeldKarte. A total of 37.8 millionpayment transactions were made using Geld-Karte.
6Until now, GeldKarte has been used
mainly at vending machines to purchasetickets and cigarettes, for example, and in carparks. It can also be used to make paymentson the internet. Increasingly, the age of thecardholder has also been stored in the Geld-Karte chip. This enables providers to checkthe customer’s legal capacity to enter intotransactions, or to block access to offers witha minimum age restriction, for instance. Add-itional functions, such as electronic ticketing(e-tickets), bonus programmes, time and ac-cess checks, and electronic signatures, offerfurther possibilities for using GeldKarte. Thenew generation of chip cards issued by thebanking industry now supports contactlessinterfaces as required by German publictransport companies for additional applica-tions of this kind.
The average payment amounts in German
card-based payments still constitute a verticalmarket segment in this area.
7As a rule, credit
cards are used to pay larger amounts andGeldKarte tends to be used for micro-pay-ments. In recent years, the average debit cardtransaction amount has fallen in comparisonwith that of the credit card, reflecting the in-creasing popularity of the debit card for day-to-day purchases.
The European Commission’s definition of
e-money also includes electronic monetaryvalues stored on a server. Server-basede-money can be accessed, for example, viamobile telephone, internet or infrastructuresfor payment cards. PayPal (Europe) Ltd, whichis licensed as an electronic money institutionby the British Financial Services Authority, hasintensified its activities in Germany, too. Pay-Pal enables individuals and businesses totransfer server-based balances over the inter-net.

94Options under the SEPA Cards Framework (SCF)
The SCF describes three options for
further European development. Combi-nations of options are also expressly per-mitted.
Option 1 envisages the replacement of a
national debit card scheme by an inter-national debit card scheme (for example,MasterCard’s “Maestro” and Visa’s“V-Pay”). This option could, however, re-sult in international card schemes domi-nating the European card market, mean-ing that broad-based competition wouldnot be achieved. Banks should also con-sider such a strategy carefully, not leastin view of the ensuing dependencies onnon-European card schemes. In the lightof the above, establishing at least onefurther European approach would seemto make sense.
A European solution could be achieved
with SCF option 2, both in the form ofthe pan-European expansion of variousnational card schemes and as a coopera-tive venture between various schemes.The technical feasibility of cooperationof this kind has been confirmed by theBerlin Group, which began its work de-veloping standards for the bilateralauthorisation and settlement of cardtransactions in October 2004 and nowconsists of more than 14 large players inthe euro-area card market.
1Building on
the Berlin Group’s preparatory work onstandardisation, the Euro Alliance of Pay-ment Schemes (EAPS) was set up in 2006with aim of interlinking the participatingnational debit card schemes. Among thefounding members of the EAPS are theGerman electronic cash system, providersfrom Italy, Portugal, the United Kingdomand Spain, and EUFISERV.
2The first pilot
phases have already begun within theEAPS. Furthermore, as early as September2005 the German banking industry an-nounced plans to extend access to elec-tronic cash throughout Europe.
SCF option 3 foresees cooperation be-
tween national and international cardschemes provided that all the schemesfulfil the SCF requirements. This practiceknown as “co-branding” (the trademarksof all the participating card schemes aredisplayed on the card) is already commonin many countries. However, this har-bours the risk that existing national ac-cess restrictions and standards will bemaintained and the cross-border compe-tition which the SEPA aims to promotewill not be achieved.

95by the European Payments Council (EPC), is
currently focusing on the implementation ofSEPA credit transfers and SEPA direct debitsand on establishing a SEPA cards framework(SCF). Debit card procedures, which in manycases dominate the national card segment,are particularly affected by SEPA develop-ments. While the relevant national debit cardscheme is used to process domestic transac-tions, cross-border transactions are processedvia the networks of the large internationalcard companies.
The Eurosystem has produced a report de-
scribing its current view of the card market tothe public.
8According to this report, the chal-
lenge in implementing the SEPA lies in ensur-ing the successful transition to an integratedcard market with a high degree of efficiencyand low fees in Europe. The migration to theSEPA must not lead to a deterioration in theconditions for cardholders or merchants. Ra-ther, the Eurosystem’s objective behind theSEPA card market is to enable cardholders inthe future to use their payment cards any-where in the euro area as easily and cheaplyas in their home country. According to theEPC’s plans, the banking industry is to havefulfilled the requirements for the launch ofSEPA-compatible payment schemes by2008.
9The Eurosystem’s report gives con-
crete shape to the EPC’s requirements for theSEPA card market as presented in the SCF,which are still rather general. The Bundes-bank expressly advocates approaches whichpromote competition and, through interoper-ability, maintain the high level of efficiency ofthe current national card schemes with aview to establishing Europe-wide use and ac-ceptance of payment cards. This requires thetechnical standardisation of all interfaces, forexample.
It has yet to be decided how card transactions
will be cleared in the SEPA. In Germany, theinfrastructures in place for the clearing andsettlement of direct debits are currently beingused. From an efficiency and cost aspect, itmight well make sense if card transactionswere cleared and settled through the infra-structures that are to be set up for SEPA directdebits. In this way, card payments could alsocontribute towards achieving the critical massfor the new SEPA infrastructures.
Security aspects for payment cards
New technologies enable new forms of at-
tack on IT systems and mean continuouslychanging requirements for ensuring an ap-propriately high level of security. This requiresthe ongoing monitoring and assessment ofdevelopments, also in the field of payments,and the timely implementation of necessaryadjustments.
In the case of payment cards, for example,
the situation is now such that the magneticstrips containing the cardholder’s bank sortcode and account number can be copiedwith little technical effort. The technical pos-sibilities for reading the magnetic strip and il-licitly identifying the PIN have also increasedsignificantly. Switching from magnetic-strip-

96based procedures to chip cards, in which the
relevant data are safely stored in a chip im-planted in the card, can help prevent thisabuse. This changeover is planned with theintroduction of the EMV standard
10in Eur-
ope. Once payment cards with EMV chipshave been introduced, there will be a sharpincrease in PIN use worldwide, and this willlargely replace signature-based authorisation.According to the EPC’s plans, the migrationto EMV chip technology should be completedas part of the work towards the SEPA by theend of 2010 at the latest.
11
In the Eurosystem’s view, payment schemes inthe Single Euro Payments Area should be atleast as secure and efficient as the best-per-forming national payment schemes oftoday.
12The European Commission also em-
phatically recommends that the payment in-dustry guarantee the highest possible eco-nomically viable level of security for electronicpayments. This implies that the highest exist-ing security level among the national cardschemes should be used as the benchmarkfor European harmonisation. In cooperationwith various standardisation initiatives, inwhich card organisations and providers areinvolved, the EPC is planning to define com-mon standards and security requirements forEurope. In the Bundesbank’s view, all thetechnical interfaces of a card payment pro-cedure must be included in the harmonisationprocess. For example, chip cards, data ex-change protocols and terminals should all befitted with the appropriate security featuresand cryptographic protection mechanisms toensure the continuous integrity and authenti-city of data and components, and to effect-ively protect the secrecy of identification data(PIN etc). These requirements are in somecases already fulfilled today.
Major factors determining the acceptance of
a payment procedure by merchants are thetime required to process a single transactionand the consistent stability of the systemeven on days with a large transaction volume.Thus, close attention should continually bepaid to availability aspects and contingencyprovisions. In Germany, a number of serviceand technical network providers operate con-currently. This decentralised structure un-doubtedly contributes towards the robustnessof the infrastructure. In addition to this, it isimportant that appropriate contingencymechanisms are in place to ensure the neces-sary performance of the schemes even ondays with particularly large transaction vol-umes.
Security issues are particularly relevant in the
case of cross-border transactions with pay-ment cards because these use componentsand infrastructures from diverse card schemesand settlement providers. One of the thingswhich the Eurosystem advocated in thefourth SEPA Progress Report was the develop-ment by the end of 2007 of a comprehensivestrategy to reduce card fraud especially in the

97international context.13The growth in cross-
border fraud with “cloned” magnetic strip
cards, which are produced after illicitly read-ing the original card data, is a cause for con-cern here. Thus, it is to be hoped that cardauthorisations for European chip cards withinEurope will be processed using only EMV chiptechnology as soon as possible.
As an incentive for card issuers and mer-
chants to introduce EMV chip cards and ter-minals, on 1 January 2005 MasterCard andVisa created a liability shift which means that,in the event of a counterfeit or copied cardbeing used, liability is borne by the partywhich has not yet switched to chip technol-ogy. If the magnetic strip on a chip card iscopied to another card and the copied card isused at a merchant terminal which does notsupport chip technology, the merchant is li-able for the ensuing damages. Conversely, ifthe merchant has already equipped his ter-minal with chip technology and transactionsare processed with magnetic strip cardswhich the issuer has not fitted with a chip,the card issuer is liable. The liability shift doesnot yet apply worldwide.
Security aspects of innovative
payment procedures
Attacks on the internet to fraudulently ac-
quire electronic identification and authorisa-tion data, known as phishing and pharmingattacks,
14are current examples of cross-
border fraud seen worldwide.In order to combat this type of fraud, it wouldseem reasonable to unequivocally declare theattempt to fraudulently acquire data for elec-tronic identification and transaction authorisa-tion a punishable offence worldwide, thusabolishing the current legal uncertainties sur-rounding this issue. In the context of combat-ing identity theft, the idea of a single emer-gency telephone number has been discussedin Europe to report compromised electronicdata of all kinds quickly and simply. In mid-2005, an emergency telephone number
15
(116 116) was introduced in Germany for thispurpose. The aim is to provide a single tele-phone number for blocking electronic author-isations, such as payment cards, mobile tele-phones and access data to internet providers.
Aside from the issues of criminal liability, pros-
ecution and customer information cam-paigns, it is essential that providers of pay-ment procedures and online banking adapttheir security measures appropriately and rap-idly to meet the changing risk situation sur-rounding identity theft. Although Germanonline banking provides a relatively high levelof protection thanks to a dual authenticationfeature which requires the user to enter a PINand a specific transaction number (TAN), thisalone is unlikely to provide sufficient protec-tion in the future. It is therefore to be wel-comed that sections of the banking industry
13See ECB, Towards a Single Euro Payments Area –

14In phishing attacks, an attempt is made - usually by
counterfeit e-mail - to redirect the recipient to a fakewebsite and to persuade him to disclose the relevant

98have already responded to the growing threat
from phishing by introducing more complexTAN procedures. Nevertheless, for the futureit might be worth considering options wherethe data on the instruction to the bank (trans-action data) are directly included in the secur-ity measure. In the medium term, the securitylevel should be further increased by employ-ing electronic signatures. The chip cards is-sued by the German banking industry to itscustomers are increasingly technicallyequipped to produce electronic signatures.
Future developments
In the future, a further increase in card-based
payment procedures can be expected in Ger-many, particularly in the light of the relativelylow level of use at present in comparison withthe EU average and with non-European coun-tries (see chart on this page). At the sametime, as the SEPA approach competition inthe card market is increasing, which is likelyto lead to further consolidation.
The performance capacity of payment
schemes is continuously increasing, whichwill further reduce the time required to pro-cess, for example, credit transfers and cardpayments. Mobile terminals and chip cardswhich support contactless transmission tech-nology are likely to play a particular role here.Providers of internet-based innovative pay-ment procedures could extend their range ofservices at merchant terminals if both the cus-tomer and the merchant had (mobile) inter-net access at the point of sale. Then, evenlow-value payments could be settled onlineat the merchant terminal at a reasonable costand with only short waiting periods. Such adevelopment would reduce the current effi-ciency advantage of cards with an e-moneyfunction for low-value payments. Ultimately,greater competition among products owingto increasingly overlapping business lines islikely to lead to consolidation, which may re-duce the variety of products currently avail-able. The first steps in this direction have al-ready been taken by credit card organisa-tions, such as MasterCard and Visa, whichhave been offering contactless credit cards inthe USA since 2002. More recent develop-ments, in Japan, for example, have shownthat contactless chip card technology can beintegrated into mobile communication de-vices without any difficulty.
The forthcoming regulatory changes under
the EU Payment Services Directive are likely tohave a major impact. The directive aims tocreate a common legal framework for theSingle Euro Payments Area. Current planningenvisages the introduction of a new type ofprovider in the field of payments known as a“payment institution”. These institutions willbe able to offer almost all payment services,in particular, giro business which, in Germany,is currently restricted to banks. Consequently,they could compete with credit institutionswithout being subject to the same strictsupervisory standards even though the risk in-volved is similar. This may intensify competi-tion between payment service providers.
On 17 February 2006, the European Commis-
sion presented a report evaluating theE-Money Directive (2000/46/EC). According

99to this report, the e-money market in the EU
has developed much more slowly than ex-pected and is far from fulfilling its real poten-tial.
16Among other things, the report points
to the restrictions and requirements imposedby the directive itself and draws attention tothe different national interpretations andrules implementing the directive as well asthe legal uncertainty surrounding the scopeand applicability.
However, this should not lead to the conclu-
sion that the rules concerning the issue ofe-money should generally be relaxed. On thecontrary, the requirements set out in theECB’s report on electronic money
17regarding
the issue of e-money from a monetary policyperspective continue to apply. These require-ments specify a refund obligation, the possi-bility of imposing a minimum reserve fore-money and statistical reporting require-ments for issuing institutions. Against thisbackdrop, a possible integration of the E-Money Directive provisions into the forthcom-ing Payment Services Directive should beviewed critically. The electronic payment pro-cedures currently under discussion in connec-tion with the Payment Services Directivemerely constitute a means of access to pay-ment instruments. By contrast, e-money is anindependent means of payment which may
also be regarded as a special form of the trad-itional bank deposit business. Thus, issuinge-money is an activity with its own specialcharacteristics, which justify it having a legalbasis of its own.Number of transactions per year
