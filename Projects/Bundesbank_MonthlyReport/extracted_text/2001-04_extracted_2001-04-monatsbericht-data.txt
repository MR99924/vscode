ManufacturingIn terms of new orders and output, there
were divergent developments in the manu-facturing sector at the start of 2001. Whileproduction increased, orders remained downon the level reached at the end of last year. InFebruary – more recent statistics are unavail-able at present – seasonally adjusted orderswere no higher than they had been in Janu-ary. Taking together the first two monthsof the year, there was a decline of 2%compared with autumn 2000. Following adouble-digit growth rate in the fourth quar-ter, the level was around 6
1FGJ%2% up on the
year.
The flow of new orders from abroad, in par-
ticular, was less buoyant at the end of theperiod under review, even though it was stillmore than 10% up on the year in that two-month period. With a year-on-year growthrate of around 3
1FGJ%2%, orders from domestic
customers were significantly below that fig-ure, however, although they largely held theirown in seasonally adjusted terms comparedwith the end of 2000.
Manufacturing output, which had been just
as high in February as it had been in the firstmonth of the year in seasonally adjustedterms, was significantly higher in January/February than in the final quarter of 2000. Asbefore, the year-on-year rate of growth wasaround 7
3FGJ%4%. This is likely to have been due
in part to the processing of orders on hand,Ordersreceived

6which had grown especially during the last
few months of 2000.
ConstructionThere was a significant fall in seasonally
adjusted demand for construction work inJanuary/February. The comparable level lastyear was undershot by 8%, which was morethan before. The main reason for this was amarked restraint on the part of industrial andpublic sector clients, which had still been pla-cing orders for a large number of construc-tion projects during the last few months of2000. It was only in residential constructionthat the order books improved somewhat atthe start of 2001.
In February, construction output recovered
somewhat after the cold winter weather hadabated. The fact that the situation in the con-struction sector is nevertheless still very un-favourable is revealed by the year-on-year de-cline in output, which has increased to morethan one-tenth since the beginning of 2001.
LabourmarketThere has been no further improvement in
the situation on the labour market recently.According to the estimations of the FederalStatistical Office, seasonally adjusted employ-ment persisted at 38.73 million persons inJanuary. The increase on the year, which hadbeen just under 1
1FGJ%2% in the fourth quarter
of 2000, fell to somewhat more than 1%.
In March, there was a further slight rise in
the seasonally adjusted number of personsEconomicconditionsinGermany*

7registered as unemployed at the Federal La-
bour Office. At the end of the period underreview, the figure was 3.80 million, i.e.around 140,000 fewer than a year before.The seasonally adjusted unemployment rateremained unchanged at 9.3%.
PricesThe year-on-year rise in the consumer price
index went down marginally from 2.6% inFebruary to 2.5% in March. Whereas a slightfall in energy prices had an easing effect,food became much more expensive at theend of the period under review. Sharp pricerises were due not only to BSE: the quite coldand rainy weather led to price increases forseasonal food products. Price movements inthe case of other goods and services re-mained largely within narrow bounds.
Although import prices went up again some-
what in February in seasonally adjustedterms, the fact that the rise was smaller thanit had been in the same period of 2000meant that the year-on-year rate of increasefell to 5.4% from 6.5% in January. Thesharpest fall in the rate of price increase over12 months was in raw materials and semi-finished goods. By contrast, price movementsin the case of finished goods (2.8% at theend of the period under review) remainedwell below average.
Domesticindustrial selling pric es showed a
slight seasonally adjusted rise in February. Theyear-on-year increase went up to 4.7%, com-pared with 4.6% at the start of 2001. Themain reason for this was a further rise inprices for sources of energy. Excluding these,
the year-on-year rate of increase declinedmarginally to 2.3%. Above all, this reflectsprice developments in consumer goods. Prod-ucts from the capital goods sector becameonly marginally more expensive comparedwith one year before.
Publicfinance
GovernmentindebtednessFollowing the substantial debt reduction in
January resulting from a one-off redemptionfinanced through the UMTS proceeds, thecentral, regional and local authorities slightlyincreased their indebtedness again in Febru-ary by 3
3FGJ%4billion. This ensued primarily from
net borrowing by the LFGJJ8nder Governments inthe amount of 31 billion, which mainly took
the form of special bond issues (just under31
1FGJ%2billion), while short-term bridging loans
from banks decreased by 31FGJ%2billion. The Fed-
eral Government, by contrast, redeemed fur-ther debt worth just under 3
1FGJ%2billion net.
The inflow of new resources from the moneymarket (not quite 31 billion), from topping
up the 30-year Federal bond issued last year(34
1FGJ%2billion) and from market management
operations (almost 311FGJ%2billion) was more
than offset by the considerable reductionin outstanding liabilities arising from loansagainst borrowers’ notes ( 33
1FGJ%4billion), five-
year special Federal bonds (Bobls)(33 billion)
and Federal savings bonds ( 31 billion). The
off-budget special funds expanded their li-abilities only marginally on balance, althoughthis masked significant changes in the debtConsumer

8profile of the “German Unity” Fund. It
covered its financing requirements for therepayment of a 10-year bond in the amountof35 billion maturing in February and for a
reduction in short-term bridging loans ( 3
3FGJ%4
billion) through greater recourse to loans
against borrowers’ notes ( 321FGJ%4billion) and
bonded debt in the form of Bobls(331FGJ%2bil-
lion). Local government debt is likely to havedeclined slightly in February.
FederalGovernmentborrowingIn March the Federal Government increased
its level of indebtedness for the first time thisyear, borrowing almost 33
1FGJ%2billion net. In
doing so it resorted exclusively to the moneymarket, where it increased its liabilities by justover 33
1FGJ%2billion. Although it tapped thecapital market, too, for about 373FGJ%4billion
gross, this amount was offset by redemptionsof a similar magnitude. The main vehicle forits gross borrowing was an issue of FederalTreasury notes – with a record volume of over38 billion (including the amount borrowed
on behalf of the “German Unity” Fund). TheFederal Government procured much smalleramounts by running down its stocks of bondsset aside for market management operations(almost 31
1FGJ%2billion) and through its tap
issues (for a total of just under 31 billion). Its
liabilities under borrowers’ note loans fell bya further 31
3FGJ%4billion net, although this was
smaller than the decrease registered in Febru-ary.
In the first quarter of 2001, taken as a whole,
the Federal Government reduced its indebt-edness by just over 316 billion. Excluding the
redemption of liabilities of the Currency Con-version Equalisation Fund ( 333 billion) fi-
nanced through the UMTS proceeds, it wouldhave increased its net borrowings by 317 bil-
lion. It continued to give precedence to finan-cing via Federal bonds (Bunds), the total
amount of which outstanding rose by almost39
1FGJ%2billion. After redemptions, the shorter-
term forms of capital market debt (FederalTreasury discount paper, Treasury financingpaper and Treasury notes) contributed a totalof only 31 billion to the Federal Govern-
ment’s net borrowing. The volume of Bobls
and Federal savings bonds outstandingdropped by 32 billion and 31
1FGJ%2billion, re-
spectively. Although money market liabilitiesgrew by 316
1FGJ%2billion, it should be taken into
account that the volume of these short-termbridging loans had shrunk to virtually zero atNetborrowinginthemarket

9the end of last year. One-third of the Federal
Government’s gross borrowing requirementsenvisaged for this year in the amount of 3138
billion was covered already in the first quarter.However, this is by no means an unusual pat-tern of financial procurement by the FederalGovernment within the annual planning hori-zon.
Securitiesmarkets
BondmarketIn February, domesticborrowers issued bonds
to the market value of 368.3 billion. In terms
of the amount, more than three-quarters ofthe issues were denominated in euro. Al-though the volume issued was smaller than inthe previous month ( 383.5 billion) owing to
the lower level of redemptions, the outstand-ing amount of debt securities increased againon balance, at 313.6 billion, after it had de-
clined in January. Foreign bonds were placedin the German market to the value of 39.4
billion net. On balance, only euro-denomin-ated bonds issued by non-residents weresold. Net sales of domesticand foreign bondsamounted to 323.0 billion in February, com-
pared with 36.9 billion in January.
Credit institutions issued their own bonds in
February to the value of 315.1 billion net,
compared with 317.3 billion in January.
Other bank bonds and communal bonds(/C214ffentliche Pfandbriefe) predominated, at
39.9 billion and 34.2 billion, respectively.
Mortgage bonds (Hypothekenpfandbriefe)
were sold to the tune of 32.5 billion, where-
as the outstanding amount of bonds issuedby specialised credit institutions fell by 31.6
billion. Net sales of corporate bonds, at 30.9
billion, were smaller than in the previousmonth ( 31.7 billion).
In February, the public sector reduced its
bonded debt by 32.4 billion. This decline was
due mainly to redemptions by the “GermanUnity” Fund. In February, the Federal Govern-ment raised funds in the bond marketamounting to 31.5 billion. Specifically, it sold
ten-year and 30-year Federal bonds to the ex-tent of 30.8 billion and 30.7 billion, respect-
ively. Five-year special Federal bonds and Fed-eral Treasury notes were sold to the value of30.7 billion and 30.3 billion, respectively.

Gross sales of Deutsche Mark/euro bonds

lion). After deduction of the higher level ofredemptions (compared with the previousmonth), the outstanding amount declined by32.6 billion.
On the buyers’ side of the bond market, do-
mesticc redit institutions were in the forefrontin February. They enlarged their bond port-folios by 313.0 billion, 39.3 billion of that
sum being accounted for by foreign paperand33.8 billion by domesticsec urities. Bankspurchased domestic bank bonds worth 34.6
billion, whereas they sold publicbonds to thetune of 30.9 billion. Domesticnon-banks in-

domesticbonds ( 37.7 billion). In February,
foreign investors purchased domestic bondsworth 32.1 billion.

11month. As in January, it was the specialised
funds that were hardest hit by the decline; at33.3 billion, they received markedly less cap-
ital than in January ( 38.4 billion). Funds open
to the general public sold certificates to thetune of 35.2 billion; that was almost as much
as in the previous month ( 35.9 billion). Al-
most one-half of that sum ( 32.4 billion) ac-
crued to open-end real estate funds. Money-market funds sold certificates to the total of30.9 billion, while share-based funds and
bond-based funds received 30.7 billion and
30.2 billion, respectively. In February, there
were virtually no sales of certificates by pen-sion investment mutual funds (Altersvorsor-
gefonds) or mixed funds. In February, foreign
fund certificates amounting to 32.1 billion
were sold in the German market.
In February, residents bought investment
fund certificates totalling 312.6 billion, with
domestic certificates greatly predominating.Non-banks increased their portfolios of do-mestic and foreign fund certificates by 39.4
billion and 32.1 billion, respectively. Credit in-
stitutions invested 31.0 billion in investment
funds. Non-residents sold domesticfund c er-tificates to the extent of 31.9 billion.
Balanceofpayments
Germany’s current account showed a surplus
of31.8 billion in February. In January, the
combined outcome of foreign trade, services,factor income and current transfers had seena deficit of 35.3 billion. That positive trend
was largely determined by higher net receiptsof factor income.According to calculations by the Federal Stat-
istical Office, there was a trade surplus of36.2 billion in February, compared with one
of34.5 billion in January. After seasonal ad-
justment, however, the trade surplus, at 35.6
billion, was somewhat below the level of theprevious month ( 36.6 billion). Following the
sharp rise in merchandise exports in January,such exports declined by 1.2% in February. Ifthe last three months are taken together, ex-ports went up by 0.9% against the previousperiod. The deterioration in the seasonally ad-justed balance of trade also owed somethingto the increase in merchandise imports,which grew by 0.7% in February over theprevious month. If the months from Decem-ber to February are taken together, however,there was a slight decline over the previousperiod (– 0.3%).
The deficit on invisible current transactions
with non-residents decreased from 39.1 bil-
lion in January to 34.0 billion in February.
That was primarily due to higher net receiptsof factor income, which showed a surplus of30.8 billion in February, following a deficit of
34.3 billion in January. Services transactions
with non-residents likewise showed a positivetrend, with net expenditure, at 32.8 billion in
February, being lower than a month before(34.3 billion). By contrast, the deficit on cur-
rent transfers to non-residents increased, andamounted to 32.0 billion in February, com-
pared with 30.4 billion in January.
The outflows of funds arising from portfolio
transactions were markedly lower in Februarythan in the preceding month; net capital ex-ports decreased from 330.9 billion to 38.6

12billion. The main reason was that residents’
investment in foreign securities markets, at311.4 billion, no longer increased as sharply
as in the previous month ( 327.1 billion). Ger-
man investors’ demand for foreign shares, inparticular, was conspicuously muted; follow-ing net purchases equivalent to 311.8 billion,
they slightly reduced (by 30.2 billion) their
portfolios of foreign shares in February. For-eign bonds and investment fund certificates,by contrast, remained in demand ( 39.2 bil-
lion and 32.1 billion, respectively). Non-resi-
dents once again slightly stepped up their in-vestment in German securities ( 32.8 billion,
after net sales of 33.8 billion in January). In
particular, they increased their holdings of do-mesticpublicbonds ( 33.8 billion), after they
had been reduced – mainly on account ofheavy redemptions – by 39.6 billion a month
earlier. In addition, foreign investors boughtGerman shares again ( 32.6 billion), whereas
in January they had reduced their investmentin the German market by a similar amount.On the other hand, they continued to rundown their portfolios of domesticmoney-market paper ( 38.3 billion). Moreover, they
sold domesticinvestment fund c ertific ates inthe amount of 31.9 billion (net).
Capital flows in the area of direct investment
almost cancelled out in February. Inflows offunds from abroad amounting to 36.8 billion
were accompanied by outflows related toGerman participating interests abroad totalling37.0 billion.

The 1988 Capital Accord of the Basel Com-
mittee of Banking Supervision (hereafter re-ferred to as the Basel Committee) representsa milestone in the international harmonisa-tion of supervisory capital regulations.
1With
thisagreement (Bas el Accord),2the minimum
capital requirement wasfixed at 8% of thestandard risk-weighted credit positions of abank, with the thusmeas ured capital im-plicitly also being intended to cover otherrisks not included in this calculation.
Although the Basel Accord was initially direct-
ed only at internationally operating banks, ithasnow become the globally recognis ed cap-ital standard for banks and is applied in morethan 100 countries. The relevant directives atthe EU level, too, have been crucially influ-enced by the Basel Accord. For that reason,the Basel Capital Accord also forms the basisof the corresponding German supervisoryregulations (Principle I pursuant to sections 10and 10a of the Banking Act).
In view of the growing importance of banks’
trading activities, banks’ market price risks(price risks in the trading book, foreign ex-change risks, commodities risks) were incorp-orated into the capital requirementsin 1996.
3
Since then, the bankshave als o been able touse their internal models in order to managethe market risk for the regulatory calculationof capital adequacy, provided that thesemodels are recognised by the banking super-visory authorities.The 1988 Basel Accord has come under in-
creasing criticism over the past few years.This is due to the fact that the institutions’economic risks are captured only very roughly– and thusimprecis ely – by the prudentiallyspecified standardised calculation of thecredit risks. New financial instruments andmethods of credit risk management, such ascredit derivatives, netting agreements for bal-ance-sheet positions, the global use of collat-eral, the securitisation of assets and credit riskmodelshave been virtually ignored up tonow. Apart from this, the gearing of the cap-ital requirementss olely to credit and marketprice risks does not correspond to the actualoverall risk profile of a bank. By revising theAccord, the Basel Committee has set itselfthe objective of eliminating, asfar aspos s ible,the cited shortcomings of prudential creditrisk measurement and of bringing the meas-urement of credit risks in the capital ad-equacy regulationsmore clos ely into line withthe banks’ risk management methods. Thismeansthat the development initiated in1996 by the recognition of internal modelsfor market risks is being continued.
1The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision was es-
tablished by the central bank governors of the Group of
Ten (G-10) countries in 1975. It consists of senior repre-
sentatives of central banks and bank supervisory author-
itiesfrom Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzer-
land, the United Kingdom and the United States. It usual-
ly meetsevery three monthsat the Bank for International
Settlements (BIS) in Basel, where its permanent secretar-

17ThethreepillarsofthenewBaselAccord
A risk-appropriate capital base – as important
as it is – cannot, on its own, ensure the solv-ency of a bank and the stability of the bank-ing system. In the final analysis, what is cru-cial isa bank’sris k and profit profile, which isdetermined by the management, in conjunc-tion with the bank’sability to manage ris ksand sustain them over the long term. TheBasel Committee therefore wishes to encour-age further improvement in the banks’ in-ternal risk management systems and themonitoring of these systems by the respon-sible supervisory bodies. In Germany andmany other countries, where regulatory activ-ity has, up to now, been characterised mainlyby the analysis of banks’ reports and of theexternal auditors’ audit reports, this newelement will effect a paradigm shift towardsbanking supervision that is more stronglyquality-oriented. Furthermore, more exten-sive disclosure obligations for banks are envis-aged so that the disciplining forces of themarketscan be us ed asa complement to theregulatory requirements.
The new Basel Capital Accord therefore con-
sists of three mutually reinforcing pillarsaffording better protection to the stability ofthe national and international banking systems.
Pillar1:
Minimumcapitalrequirements
Compliance with the capital requirement of
Basel II is measured, as before, using the “cap-ital ratio” which must be no lower than 8%.
Capital
 total risk-weighted assets credit risk +
(capital charges market risk + operational risk) x 12.5>_  8%
While no changesare currently planned with
regard to the definition of the term “capital”and the minimum capital ratio of 8% hasalso remained unchanged, the “operationalrisk” has now been added to the existing risktypes“credit ris k” and “market ris k”. In fu-ture, the operational risk is to be explicitlycovered by capital.
The calculation of the minimum capital re-
quirementsisgeared to an average analys iswith regard to the distribution of risk in thebanking sector and, therefore, does not re-flect the specific circumstances of individualinstitutions in every case. The credit institu-The three pillars

fundsover and above compliance with theminimum capital requirementsif thisiscalledfor by their specific risk situation.
The new regulatory capital requirementsare
not only to be adapted to market develop-ments but should also take account of thevarying stages of development in risk man-agement at individual banks. As part of anevolutionary approach, standardised methodsof risk measurement and refined methods areenvisaged in each case. The transition to theregulatory use of more precise methods is tobe “rewarded” by a moderate relaxation ofthe capital requirements. This means that thebankshave an incentive to continue develop-ing their methodsof internal managementwithin the various risk categories.
CreditrisksFor measuring the capital requirement for
credit risk, the Basel Committee proposes astandardised approach as well as an “internalratings based approach” (IRB) based on abank’sinternal ratingsof ris k.
In the standardised approach, risk weights
are specified, as before, for certain types ofclaims. In addition to the familiar weights(0%, 20%, 50% and 100%), a new weight-ing factor of 150% hasbeen introduced forborrowerswith a poor rating. In the s tandard-ised approach, the risk weighting in the indi-vidual risk groups (mainly “banks”, “non-banks” and “sovereigns”) will in future sub-stantially depend on assessments by externalcredit assessment institutions (above all, rat-ing agencies and also, in the case of sover-
eigns, on the export credit agencies of theOECD) (see table on page 20). The BaselCommittee isaware that the ratingsappliedby the rating agenciesand other ins titutionsvary worldwide. For that reason, further workisbeing undertaken, with one of the aimsbeing to define rangesof probability of de-fault (PD) asa bas isof allocation to one ofthe weighting categories. These probabilitiesof default must also be consistent with therequirementspertaining to banks ’ internalratings.
Claimson s overeignsare weighted, depend-
ing on their rating, at between 0% and150%. For claimson central government inGermany, the 0% weighting continuestoapply under the modified standardised ap-proach aswell.
Claimson non-central government public
sector entities (PSEs) are weighted in thesame way as claims on banks. Subject to na-tional discretion, however, claims on domes-tic PSEsmay als o be treated asclaimson thesovereigns in whose jurisdictions the PSEs areestablished . This means that the risk assess-ment applied hitherto in Germany can be re-tained, i.e. not only the Federal government,but also the Federal states (L,CPP2nder) , legally
dependent special funds of the Federal gov-ernment or a state as well as local authoritiesand local authority associations are given a0% weighting.

fit in future from a 0% weighting if they alsofulfil specific criteria established by the Basel

19Committee with regard to their shareholder
structure, their shareholders’ continued cap-ital contributionsaswell astheir level of cap-ital and lending policy.
The consultative paper provides two options
for claims on banks. The national supervisorsare to decide which option will be applied toall banks in their jurisdiction. Under the firstoption, banks are assigned a risk weight onecategory less favourable than that assignedto claimson the s overeign of incorporation.The second option bases a bank’s risk weight-ing on itsexternal rating. Furthermore, s hort-term claims(with a maturity of three monthsor less) are to be assigned a preferential riskweight within certain limits.
4
Retaining the possibility of deriving the creditrating of banksfrom the s overeign of incorp-oration (option 1) isa welcome outcomefrom both a national and an EU perspective,since this means that the existing rating gapin the case of small and medium-sized banksdoesnot have an advers e impact on their refi-nancing.
Claimson s ecuritiesfirmsare to be treated in
accordance with the same rules as those en-visaged for banks, provided that the securitiesfirms are subject to comparable supervisoryand regulatory arrangementswith the s amecapital requirements.
Claimson corporates(including ins urance
companies) are to be weighted in future de-pending on their external risk rating. For thispurpose, three new risk weight categories arebeing introduced for corporates(20%, 50%,150%). Asbefore, claimson unrated corpor-
atesare to be given a ris k weight of 100%.
Claimss ecured by mortgageson res idential
property that isor will be occupied by the bor-rower, or that isrented, need to be ris k weight-ed at only 50% in future aswell. In the cas e ofclaimss ecured on commercial real es tate, theBasel Committee is adhering to its fundamen-tally cautious assessment (100% weighting),but a reduced weighting of 50% is also pos-sible if certain conditions are fulfilled.
5
A 150% risk weight category has been newlyintroduced not only for claimswith a poor ex-ternal rating but also for claims for whichdelaysin payment have occurred. In particu-lar, the unsecured portions of claims of anyasset, net of specific provisions, that is pastdue for more than 90 daysisto be ris kweighted at 150%.
The decision on whether an external credit as-
sessment institution (rating agency) is recog-nised as being suitable for assigning regulatoryrisk weights is taken by the national supervisors.Specifically, in order to be recognised, the ratingagency in question must satisfy the criteria setout in the table on page 21. These criteria giverise to a number of issues concerning their im-

dence over a period of at least ten years that, on a na-
tional average (i) losses stemming from commercial real
estate lending up to the lower of 50% of the market
value or 60% of loan-to-value (LTV) based on mortgage-
lending-value (MLV) must not exceed 0.3% of the out-
standing loans in any given year, and that (ii) overall

Asset-backedsecuritiesThe new Basel Capital Accord introduces
internationally harmonised regulations on thesupervisory treatment of asset-backed secur-ities(ABS). The fact that the prudentiallymeasured credit risk has differed hithertofrom the actual credit risk, especially whentaking portfolio effectsinto account, hasinpart led market players to develop securitisa-tion techniquesasa method of optimis ing
their internal capital management. The out-come of thisisthat ABS trans actionshaveoften resulted in a significant lowering of theregulatory capital requirementswithout acorresponding reduction in the bank’s creditrisk in all cases (regulatory capital arbitrage).
A fundamental distinction has to be made be-
tween two types of asset-backed securitiestransactions:
A traditional ABS involves a given asset of a
credit institution (originator) being sold to athird party which has been set up solely forthis purpose (known as a “special purposevehicle” or SPV). The SPV refinancesits elf byissuing securities, the redemption of which islinked to the servicing of the acquired asset.Creditassessmentsandriskweightsinthestandardisedapproach*

21In what are known as synthetic structures,
however, the asset is not sold by the origin-ator. Instead, the credit risk contained inthe asset is transferred through the use ofcredit derivatives, thus constituting a synthe-tic counter-position (hedge). Synthetic trans-actionshave the advantage that they do notrequire a transfer or assignment of the assetsand thusachieve a greater flexibility and add-itional cost advantages.
The future capital requirementsfor banksas
investors, i.e. buyers of ABS tranches, will bedetermined in the standard approach by theexternal assessment of such paper (see tableon page 20).
What iscrucial for the minimum capital re-
quirementsin the cas e of the originatingbank iswhether – and to what extent – thecredit risk has been transferred as a result ofthe securitisation structure. Firstly, the explicitrisks are to be taken into account and weight-ed as risk assets which the bank assumes, say,by retaining individual tranchesof ABS or byproviding linesof liquidity. Furthermore, theremay also be implicit risks for the bank aftersecuritisation in the form of non-contractualrecourse. For example, in order to protect itsreputation, a bank may counter a deterior-ation of the underlying assets by exchangingthe claimsthat are s ubject to payment diffi-culties for more valuable assets. The debatein the Basel Committee on the extent towhich capital requirements should be usedalso to take account of these implicit risks hasnot yet been concluded.Riskmitigationtechniques
To a greater extent than before, banking super-
visors will in future recognise the instrumentsthat are used in banking practice for securingloans– collateral, guarantees , credit derivativesand netting agreementsfor balance-s heet pos -itions(on-balance-s heet netting). The main dif-ference between collateral, on the one hand,and guaranteesand credit derivatives , on theother, isthat, in the cas e of collateral, the lend-ing bank receivesan as s et

The value of collateral changesover time.
Supervisory “haircuts” of the value of theposted collateral are designed to protectagainst such price volatility. The past fluctu-ationsin the value of the category of collat-eral in question, taking into account its re-sidual maturity, are the basis for determiningthe haircuts. The frequency with which thecollateral is valued and the possibility of de-manding variation marginsare als o taken intoconsideration. Institutions which possess amarket risk model recognised by the super-visors may determine the haircuts themselvesusing their market risk model.Irrespective of potential decreases in the
value of the collateral, there may also, for ex-ample, be weaknesses in the contractualtermsor with regard to an immediate utilis a-tion of the collateral. For that reason, the fac-tor applied to the collateralised portion of theexposure is generally 15% of the risk weightof the original borrower (w factor), althoughthisfactor may be dis pens ed with if certaintypesof collateral are provided. In the cas e ofshort-term repo and securities lending/secur-ities borrowing transactions with domesticgovernment securities, for example, a 100%collateralisation is recognised if such transac-tionsare s ubject to certain conditions , includ-ing daily remargining. Short-term moneymarket operationsvia s ecuritieslending andborrowing transactions are thereby givenspecial treatment.
In the case of guarantees and credit deriva-
tives, the risk weight of the protection pro-vider is assigned, as before, to the collateral-ised exposure (substitution approach).
7The
inclusion of the w factor is new here, too.
Finally, the possibilities of recognising collatera-
lisation techniques are being enhanced by arisk mitigation applying in future even if thehedge doesnot run until the end of the con-tractually agreed exposure, i.e. there is a ma-turity mismatch between the loan and hedginginstrument.

Internalratingsbased(IRB)approachThe authorisation of internal rating for pur-
poses of calculating regulatory capital buildson the banks’ tried-and-tested credit man-agement techniquesand continuesthecourse set out by the supervisory recognitionof market risk models in making increaseduse of banks’ own methods of managementand risk measurement for calculating regula-tory capital. At the same time, the way is tobe prepared for the supervisory recognitionof credit risk models representing a furtherdevelopment of the internal rating methods.
The IRB approach in the new accord isdivided
into three elements:
– the relevant risk components– the calculation of the risk-weighted assets– the minimum requirementswhich the
bankshave to fulfil if they wis h to qualifyfor the IRB approach.
Under the IRB approach, the capital require-
mentsare calculated by reference to s ixclasses of assets: corporates, banks, sover-
eigns, retail, project finance and equity.
A similar treatment is envisaged for corporate,
bank and sovereign exposures. Further work isneeded in the area of retail exposure and, inparticular, project finance. Within the IRB ap-proach, a simpler method of calculating thecredit risk arising from retail portfolios is to bemade possible. This is intended to make it easier– especially for smaller banks – to start using in-ternal ratingsfor the calculation of regulatorycapital. Given the broad dispersion of risk insuch portfolios, a lower capital requirementthan in the case of the other loan portfolios isenvisaged (see chart on page 25). Smaller cor-porates and self-employed persons are also likelyto benefit from thisass uch loansare, under cer-tain conditions, assigned to the retail portfolio.Standardsupervisoryhaircuts*

24In order to enable aslarge a number of banks
as possible to have access to the IRB ap-proach, the new Basel regulations provide fortwo alternative IRB approaches: the simpler“foundation approach” and the “advancedapproach”, the latter being based on abroader use of banks’ own internal assess-ments of risk components. The Basel Com-mittee expectsthat only a s mall number ofbanksworldwide will be able to apply theadvanced approach immediately when thenew regulationscome into force (2004).
The risk components of exposures to corpor-
ates, banks and sovereigns contained in theIRB approach are based on the accepted prac-tice of credit risk measurement and creditmanagement. First of all, the financial stand-ing of the borrower is assessed by assignmentto an internal rating grade. In the next stage,the probability of default (PD) ises timated forthe time horizon of one year for each internalrating grade. If the borrower defaults, the po-tential loss is dependent on other risk param-eters. If the proceeds from the paymentsmade by the borrower and from the utilisa-tion of the collateral and guaranteesare in-sufficient to cover the bank’s exposure, thisimplies an actual loss, the expected value ofwhich isthe expected los sat the time of thedefault, which istermed “los sgiven default”(LGD). This variable is usually expressed as apercentage of the expected exposure to theborrower at the time of default, known as“exposure at default” (EAD). Furthermore,the residual maturity of a loan, called the“effective maturity” (M), also plays a role as arisk component in the IRB approach.The definition of default haskey importance
in estimating the risk components – in par-ticular, the probability of default – and thusthe amount of regulatory capital required. Inpractice, variouscredit eventsare us ed forthispurpos e. In order to create comparablecompetitive conditionsinternationally, theBasel Committee has proposed a referencedefinition of default (see overview onpage 26).
8
In order to facilitate a widespread applicationof internal rating and to make it easier forbanksto introduce more complex methodsofmeasurement, the foundation IRB approachenvisages that, of the quantitative risk com-ponents, the banks estimate only the prob-abilitiesof default of the rating gradesin theindividual risk asset categories. The other riskcomponents(M, LGD, EAD) are s pecifiedby the supervisors.
9Collateral, guarantees,
credit derivativesand netting agreementsare,in effect, taken into account in a way similarto that of the standardised approach.
The advanced IRB approach offersthe banks
the possibility of using internally estimatedparametersfor all the cited ris k componentsexcept the residual maturity. Moreover, thegroup of eligible collateral isnot res trictedand due account may be taken of the LGD onthe basis of the bank’s historical and empirical
8An analogousdefinition of default appliesto retail ex-
posures, albeit with the following modification: the term
“restructuring” covers, in particular, any prolongation of
an exposure (such as extending the loan maturity in order
to reduce repayment instalments).
9The residual maturity is assumed to be three years on
average. The supervisory LGD values are 50% for senior
claims and 75% for subordinated claims. The EAD is
determined by the current utilisation plus 75% of the
undrawn credit line.Two IRB

25information on loss rates. With the exception
of off-balance-sheet positions, the EAD, too,may be determined by the individual bank.However, the bankshave to adhere toextended qualitative minimum requirementsfor these additional estimations.
In the advanced IRB approach, two alterna-
tives are under discussion for taking the re-sidual maturity of a loan into consideration.These two approaches result in differing ad-justment factors. The inclusion of the matur-ity asa determinant of the credit ris k mus tnot lead to long-term credit operationshav-ing to be made subject to capital require-mentsthat are too high and cons equentlybeing placed under a strain. The long-termfinancial relationships in the German bankingsystem have not only been a factor that hasincreased the stability of the financial system.They have also encouraged overall economicgrowth and employment.
In addition to the capital requirement based
on the individual exposures, the capitalrequirement isadjus ted depending on thegranularity
10of the loan portfolio. A concen-
tration of single borrowers or groups of close-ly related borrowers (large exposures) isregarded as a significant risk factor and thusincreases the overall capital requirement.High granularity, by contrast, implies a smallercapital requirement.
Bankswhich intend to us e the IRB approach
for calculating supervisory capital must, firstof all, satisfy general minimum requirementsfor the authorisation of internal rating pro-cedures. These requirements are designed toensure that the rating system, the rating pro-
cess and the estimated risk components of abank are adequate.
Among the minimum requirements, particu-
lar emphasis should be placed on the require-mentspertaining to the application of intern-al rating methodsand internal validation.Both criteria are intended to ensure that therating systems used for calculating regulatorycapital are employed not just for regulatorypurposes but also actually for the banks’ in-ternal risk management.

sideration in the pricing of loans and risk pro-visioning. Furthermore, in conformity withthe requirementsof the s econd pillar of theconsultative paper, internal ratings have to beincorporated into the internal assessment ofcapital adequacy. This does not necessarily re-quire the use of a credit risk model. Neverthe-less, for assessing capital adequacy, the banksare required additionally to have in placesound stress testing processes in order toassess potential crisis scenarios.
For the credit institutions, there exists the
possibility of applying the IRB approach initial-ly to only some of the risk assets. Such partialuse of the IRB approach must be only for alimited period, however. The bank hastoadopt the IRB approach for all risk assets andbusiness units within an appropriately short
period of time. This is necessary on groundsof risk management and for preventing insti-tutionsapplying the mos t capital-favourablealternative in each case. To this end, a cogentstrategy and a time schedule for the integraluse of the IRB approach are to be agreed withthe supervisors. Excepted from this are riskassets in business units which, owing to theirsize and risk profile, are comparatively insig-nificant.
Following the implementation of the new
Capital Accord in 2004, there will be a transi-tional period of three years. At the start ofthisperiod, bankshave to s ubmit no morethan two yearsof his torical data for their in-ternal assessment of the probability of defaultrather than data for five yearsasactuallycalled for in the minimum requirements.This requirement will increase every year, sothat five yearsof his torical data have to bepresented in 2007.
For a period of two yearsafter the implemen-
tation of the regulations, banks opting imme-diately for the advanced IRB approach willhave to perform parallel calculationsfor thecapital requirementson the bas isof both thefoundation and advanced IRB approach.During this period, as specified by the BaselCommittee, the capital requirementsfor theadvanced approach should not fall below90% of the capital requirement under thefoundation approach. For parallel calculation,the Basel Committee intends to present sim-plified calculation proceduresunder the foun-dation approach.

27Operationalrisk
Operational risk is defined as “the risk of dir-
ect or indirect loss resulting from inadequateor failed internal processes, people and sys-temsor from external events ”.
11
Operational risks, which were hitherto in-cluded only implicitly in the Capital Accord,have become increasingly important over thepast few years. The main reason for this – be-sides the fact that banking operations are be-coming more and more dependent on IT, therelated trend towardsmore outs ourcing andthe spread of electronic banking – is the fun-damentally greater complexity of business op-erationswhich isbeing intens ified by the on-going process of concentration in the bank-ing industry. Banks class operational risk asthe second most important category of riskafter credit risk and allocate roughly one-fifthof their own economic capital for thispur-pose. Nevertheless, the management mech-anisms, especially methods of defining andquantifying operational risk, are still at anearly stage of development; so far no stand-ard on thishasemerged.
Not least in view of the wide range of differ-
ent methods used in practice, the Basel Com-mittee on Banking Supervision – following ex-tensive consultation with the banking indus-try – hass pecified three methodologiesformeasuring the operational risks: the basic in-dicator approach, the standardised approachand the internal measurement approach. Thisrange of approaches, which represents a’continuum’ characterised by increasing risksensitivity and sophistication accompanied bya simultaneous reduction in capital charges,
givesthe banksthe freedom – and isintend-ed to encourage them – to switch to moresophisticated risk management techniques.
The basic indicator approach is a less sophisti-
cated procedure which isapplicable to anybank but which doesnot involve a genuinemeasurement of risk. The capital charge is de-termined using an indicator – for example,gross income.

28risk, the banking supervisors expect inter-
nationally active banksand credit ins titutionswith a significant operational risk to use moreprecise methodologies, i.e. at least the stand-ardised approach.
In the standardised approach, the operational
risk is measured using an indicator that re-flectsthe volume of the bank’sactivitieswith-in each business line, such as retail banking orpayment and settlement. The operational riskisthen weighted by a capital factor s pecifiedby the supervisors. The Basel Committee isaware that thisapproach, too, repres entsonly a rough measurement of risk, since it isnot based on any loss data specific to theinstitution. The supervisors therefore advo-cate that banks switch from the standardisedapproach to the internal measurement ap-proach. In order to create incentivesto do s o,banks– in addition to enjoying lower capitalcharges– are to be given the option of apply-ing the internal measurement approach onlyto some lines of business (partial use) tobegin with.
The internal measurement approach is the
most sophisticated approach and also takesaccount of the institutions’ individual experi-ence of operational losses. Under this ap-proach, the operational risk is measured bybusiness lines and types of loss (e.g. write-offs, legal costs). Consequently, a distinctionis made not only by line of business but alsoby the type of operational loss in each busi-ness area. The banks determine the scale ofthe expected operational loss by each type ofloss and business line on the basis of internalloss data (supplemented, to the necessary ex-tent, by external loss data). The overall capital
requirement isthen calculated by multiplyingthese expected losses by a capital factor spe-cified by the supervisors.
In addition to the approachesoutlined in the
consultative paper, a fourth method, knownas the “loss distribution approach”, is cur-rently under discussion. Under this approach,the banksmay, under certain circums tances ,determine the operational risk using their in-ternal models. The supervisory assessment ofrisk mitigation techniques, such as insuranceagainst operational risk, is also being studiedat present.
Since the supervisors, too, are venturing into
new territory in termsof s etting capital re-quirementsto cover operational ris k, furtherconsultation with the banking industry and,in particular, the systematic construction ofrelevant databases are of paramount import-ance. Establishing qualitative standards whichhave to be met in order to use the advancedapproacheswill als o be a focal point of futurework.

29In the view of the Basel Committee, the aver-
age level of provisioning with own funds forcapital adequacy purposes by banks in theG-10 countries should essentially remain un-changed. Depending on the individual risksituation, this will lead to a raising of the cap-ital requirementsfor s ome banksand a lower-ing of them in the case of others. When cali-brating the risk weights under the internalratings based approach, it should be takeninto account that the new Capital Accordprovidesfor an explicit capital charge foroperational risks which were hitherto implicit-ly covered by other items. Initial studies,based on the credit institutions’ data, showthat the ratio of credit risk to operational riskin the banking sector is roughly 4:1. In orderto achieve the objective of an unchangedaverage minimum capital requirement of 8%(relative to the existing standardised risk-weighted credit positions of a bank), thecredit risk and the operational risk are cali-brated, using a top-down approach, at 6.4%and 1.6%, respectively.
The calculation of a representative “average
portfolio” playsa key role in calibrating therisk weights under the IRB approach. Thisaverage portfolio is designed to reflect, firstly,the weighting of the various risk asset classesunder the IRB approach and, secondly, theway in which the risk assets are distributedamong the various rating grades. The envis-aged 6.4% calibration for the credit risk re-latesto the weighted mean of all portfolioclasses under the IRB approach. In someclasses (corporates, for example), this maylead to a higher weighting than the average6.4%. In other classes (such as retail), it mayresult in a lower weighting. In the calibration,
due account also has to be taken of greaterrecognition being given to the effectsofcredit risk mitigation techniques. The annexprovidesan explanation of the method of de-termining the benchmark risk weights forcorporatesunder the foundation approach asa function of the borrower’sprobability ofdefault.
The calibration of the risk weights is closely
connected with the “Quantitative ImpactStudy” which iscurrently being conducted bythe Basel Committee. The aim of this study is,firstly, to investigate what impact the newCapital Accord will have on the regulatorycapital ratiosof the banksand, s econdly, tocollect the data needed for calibrating therisk weights under the IRB approach and forthe operational risk. The distribution of therisk assets among the various rating gradesplaysa key role in thiscontext.
Pillar2:
SupervisoryReviewProcess(SRP)
The “Supervisory Review Process” represents
a major innovation in the revision of the 1988Basel Capital Accord. Within the “second pil-lar”, which isan integral part of the newCapital Accord having equal status alongsidethe minimum capital requirementsand thepromotion of market transparency, particularemphasis is placed on the need for qualitativebanking supervision.
The main aims of the supervisory review pro-
cess may be summarised as follows:

30The banksare to be encouraged to make
continuousimprovementsto their internalprocedures for assessing their institution-specific risk profile and capital adequacy. Thisappliesequally to the continual adaptationand development of new risk managementmethodsand internal controls .
The supervisory review process is designed to
capture external factors, such as the influenceof the business cycle, as well as risk areaswhich have not – or not completely – beentaken into consideration when calculating theminimum capital requirements(e.g. interes trate risks in the banking book or uncertaintiesin measuring operational risks).
The supervisory review approach will promote
the dialogue between banks and supervisors,since the institutions’ own procedures will be-come the yardstick of supervisory assessmentto a much greater extent than in the past.Finally, the supervisors will assess the banks’ability to identify, measure, manage andmonitor their risk exposures.
Supervisors are to have the ability to take ac-
tion requiring banksto hold capital in exces sof the minimum capital requirementsup to alevel that is indicated as necessary by an as-sessment of the institution as a whole. Theaction to be taken in each case, such as strict-er monitoring of the bank or requiring higherregulatory capital ratios, is left to the discre-tion of the supervisory authority.
The supervisory review process represents a
major challenge to German banking super-visors. To a much greater extent than before,supervisors are required to be “close” to the
banks so that they can identify risks at anearly stage and initiate any regulatory meas-uresthat are needed. Not leas t, the ques tionof obtaining the quantity and quality of re-sources which the banking supervisors needfor conducting the monitoring process willplay a major role in the implementation ofBasel II. In an international context, greaterharmonisation will be absolutely crucial – notonly in major regulations, such as the capitalrequirements for banks, but also in supervis-ory practices– s o that a level playing fieldexists for the banks in different countries.
Pillar3:
Enhanceddisclosure
The provisions on the minimum capital re-
quirements (pillar 1) and the supervisory re-view process (pillar 2) are joined by transpar-ency requirements(pillar 3), which are de-signed to allow a complementary use of mar-ket mechanisms for regulatory objectives.Thisisbas ed on the expectation that well in-formed market playerswill reward credit ins ti-tutions’ risk-aware business managementand effective risk management in their invest-ment and credit decisions and/or penaliseriskier behaviour. This provides credit institu-tionswith an additional incentive to controland efficiently manage their risks.
A flexible strategy has been developed for
achieving market discipline of this kind and fortaking due account of the interests of thecredit institutions and the market players. Interms of the scope and frequency of disclos-

31ure, for example, the principlesof materiality
and protection of confidential information canbe taken into consideration when determininga bank’sindividual dis clos ure practice. Where-as, generally, disclosure should be made on asemi-annual basis, credit institutions that oper-ate only in a particular region or particulararea of business and have a stable risk profilemay, for example, report annually. Also, thedistinction between core and supplementarydisclosures allows reporting which is consistentwith the bank’sown ris k profile. Only majorinternationally active banksare expected toprovide the full range of disclosure.
The proposals on disclosure are generally
framed as recommendations, since supervisorsare often not the competent authority for issu-ing accounting regulations. They have the sta-tus of requirements in those cases where dis-closure relates to the application of certain in-ternal procedures, such as the use of internalratings, asset securitisation or the inclusion ofcollateral in determining the credit risk to becovered by capital. This is because the institu-tion can achieve lower regulatory capital ratioswith the above-mentioned procedures. Super-visory recognition of internal methods and in-struments that have the effect of lowering thecapital ratiosdependson compliance with therelevant transparency requirements, thus en-suring that the institution’s associated scopefor discretion is under a certain degree of pub-lic control.
The transparency provisions relate to four
areas: application of capital requirements,structure of capital, risk exposures and capitaladequacy.When applying the capital requirementson a
consolidated basis, there should be disclosureof which corporate entitiesbelong to the cor-porate group and how such participatinginterests (equity and capital) have beencaptured when calculating the risk positionsand the eligible capital (e.g. consolidation ordeduction from capital).
This section of the second consultative paper
requires disclosure of the nature and scope ofthe individual featuresof capital, and of theoverall eligible capital. The key disclosure rec-ommendationsrelate, in particular, to thecore capital and itsindividual components : anexplanation isto be given of the nature andtermsof innovative core capital componentswith regard, say, to maturity, cumulative char-acteristics, step-up provisions and repaymentagreements.
This disclosure is designed to enable market
players to assess a bank’s risk positions andrisk management and covers four key bank-ing risks: credit risk, market risk, operationalrisk and interest rate risk in the banking book.The recommended disclosure structure largelyadheresto a uniform pattern. The current ris kprofile as an ex ante risk assessment is com-pared with the risks that have actually materi-alised during the reporting period in an expost analysis in what is known as “back-test-ing”. Thisisintended to convey an impres s ionof the reliability and quality of the chosen riskmanagement methods.
The capital requirementsin the individual ris k
categoriesand the overall capital ratio are tobe disclosed. If a credit institution itself de-

32finesan “economic capital” and us esit for in-
ternal risk management and/or internal riskmitigation by assigning limits to classes ofrisk, business lines or business units, disclos-ure of these figures is desirable, since theycan provide information on how regulatorycapital compareswith economic capital.
In order to keep the institutions’ workload to
a minimum, the disclosure recommendationsgenerally aim at the publication only of infor-mation that can be easily obtained from in-ternal accounting, i.e. data that ispreparedin any case for risk management or externalaccounting purposes. As part of its contactswith the International Accounting StandardsCommittee (IASC), the Basel Committee isendeavouring to have its disclosure require-mentsincorporated into the current revis ionof IAS 30 “Disclosures in the Financial State-
mentsof Banksand Similar Financial Ins titu-tions” in order to maintain as large a degreeof conformity as possible between the super-visory disclosures and the disclosures formingpart of external accounting.
Timeschedule,implementation
The consultation period that has been run-
ning since the publication of the second con-sultative paper in mid-January of this yearendsin May 2001. Asthe debate on a num-ber of detailed aspects of the new regulationswill, in all probability, not be concluded bythe end of May, there will be a close dialoguewith the banking industry on the issues thatare still unresolved even after the end of theconsultation period. At the same time, the in-stitutions’ comments on the consultativepaper that hasbeen pres ented can be incorp-orated aspart of an interactive proces suntilthe work is finalised. The consultative periodtherefore doesnot mark the end of thebanks’ opportunities of influencing the futureBasel regulations.
The information, remarksand commentspro-
vided during the consultation are to be in-corporated and assimilated within the follow-ing few monthswith the aim of adopting thenew Accord before the end of thisyear.Implementation of Basel II is scheduled forearly in 2004.

regulationsattheEUlevel;translationintonationallaw
Asmentioned at the beginning of thisarticle,
the Basel Capital Accord has no formal legis-lative character, but it doeshave a crucial in-fluence on the relevant directivesat the levelof the EU and thusals o on German bankingsupervisory law.
At the European level, intensive work on the
revision of the capital adequacy regulations istherefore taking place in parallel with thework of the Basel Committee. The EuropeanCommission published a consultative paperof itsown directly after publication of each ofthe two Basel consultative papers. The Com-mission’s papers largely follow the example ofthe Basel proposals but are more closelygeared to the banking structure in Europe. Inparticular, thisisintended to ens ure that thenew regulationscan be applied to the largenumber of small and medium-sized banks inthe EU.
Mainly on groundsof competition, the Euro-
pean Union isaiming to s et the timetable forthe legislative process in the EU so that thenew capital adequacy regulations, even withdue regard to the national implementationprocess, can likewise enter into force in 2004as envisaged by the Basel Committee. Inorder to achieve thisambitiousobjective, theEuropean Commission has proposed imple-mentation in three “strands”.In the first strand, the major decisions and
principlesare to be s et down in a directive.The European Commission intends to presenta firs t draft of thisdirective asearly asmid-2001. The second strand is to be formed byannexesto the directive, incorporating areasthat are still being elaborated or which de-pend on market developments. Any amend-mentsto the annexeswhich are required laterare to be made through the comitology pro-cedure.
13Finally, in the third strand a higher
degree of convergence isto be achieved inthe interpretation of uncertain legal termsand in exercising the powers conferred onthe supervisory authorities with the aim ofadvancing the harmonisation of supervisorypractices.
The relevance to competition of a simultan-
eousimplementation of the new capital re-quirementsisperceived in Germany, too. Forthisreas on, the Financial Committee of theBundestag has already discussed the proposalon several occasions. Furthermore, the Fed-eral Ministry of Finance has started talks withthe institutions involved in supervision inorder to put in place the framework neededfor a timely implementation with the Baselstandard.
13The comitology procedure isbas ed on the third indent
of Article 202 of the EU Treaty asrevis ed by the Treaty of
Amsterdam, governing the excercise of implementing
powers(comitology procedure) in the actswhich the
Council adopts. This is supplemented by the Council
Decision laying down the procedures for the exercise of
implementing powers conferred on the Commission. The
precondition for the comitology procedure isthat all es -

Thisannex will s how how the capital requirements
are calculated under the new Basel Capital Accordusing the standard approach and the IRBapproach. Moreover, it explainshow the ris k miti-gation techniquesare taken into account.
StandardisedapproachExamplesThe capital charge for a loan iscalculated, accord-
ing to the standardised approach, using the tableon page 20:
The bank hasa government bond in the banking
book worth 31,000 with a BB rating given by a
recognised rating agency:Credit exposure of 31,000 x risk weight of 100%
x capital ratio of 8% = capital charge of 380.
Loan of 31,000 to an enterprise, with the enter-
prise being given an A rating by a recognised rat-ing agency:loan amount of 31,000 x risk weight of 50% x
capital ratio of 8% = capital charge of 340 for the
loan.
Loan of 31,000 to an unrated enterprise:
loan amount of 31,000 x risk weight of 100% x
capital ratio of 8% = capital charge of 380.
Purchase of a corporate bond, with an issue rating
of AA, the enterprise having an issuer rating of A:Loan amount of 31,000 x risk weight of 20% x
capital ratio of 8% = capital charge of 316.Creditriskmitigationtechniques
The principles
14for the recognition of collateral de-
veloped by the Basel Committee are intended torecognise collateral at that value which can alwaysbe achieved for utilisation purposes. For this, hair-cuts are used to calculate the “adjusted value”:

All haircutsare applied to the current market value
C of the collateral received.
The size of the haircut depends on the frequency of
revaluation, the type of collateral (including issuer,maturity and rating of the bonds) and the type oftransaction (e.g. repos with daily remargining).
ExamplesLoan of 3950 to an unrated enterprise (risk weight
of 100%). Collateral: shares included in a mainindex and having a current value of 31,000. No
maturity mismatch, but currency mismatch (sharesnot traded in euro). Collateral isrevalued every90 trading days.

(IRBapproach)
Unlike the standardised approach, where regula-
tory risk weights are to be used, the risk weightsused in the IRB approach are individually calculatedby the banks for the risk components of every sin-gle loan using a continuous function mandated bythe supervisory authority.

15The benchmark risk weights for enterprises in the IRB
approach are set using, for instance, credit risk models. Al-
though credit risk models cannot yet be recognised for
supervisory purposes at present (the computation of de-
fault correlations for borrowers is still beset with problems
at present, and methods still need to be developed for ad-
equately validating credit risk models), it makes sense to
calculate the relative risk weights using credit risk models.
The relative risk weights define the slope of the curve of
benchmark risk weights. The absolute values of bench-
mark risk weights derive from the goal of calibrating cap-
ital chargeson credit ris k at an average of 6.4% (8% cap-
ital requirement minus1.6 percentage pointsfor oper-
ational risk) and depend greatly on the distribution of the
representative average portfolio’s risk assets among the
various risk classes. In a first step, credit risk models calcu-
late the economic capital for the bank’sentire loan port-
folio and, in a second step, allocate it among the individual
loans. The amount of economic capital allocated to an in-
dividual loan dependsin general not only on itscharacter-
istics but additionally on the composition of the portfolio.
This effect is not desirable for the proposed capital charge,
which isintended to depend only on the characteris ticsof
the loan (e.g. itsprobability of default). However, there
are two assumptions under which the allocation of eco-
nomic capital to the variousloansdoesnot depend on the
composition of the portfolio: (a) there is only one system-

the borrowers; and (b) the portfolio is infinite or asymptot-
ically granular. The Basel Committee therefore chose a
“single-factor” credit risk model when setting the relative
risk weights in the IRB approach, assuming an asymptotic-
ally granular portfolio. At the same time, depending on
the granularity of the portfolio, the capital requirement is
adjusted for the impact of the simplifying assumption (b).
Assumption (a), which says only one systematic factor
exists, presents a greater constriction, however. It is as-
sumed de facto that a monolithic economic cycle exists

37To obtain the risk-weighted asset for a loan, the
EAD of a loan ismultiplied by the ris k weight. Wethen take thisres ult, multiply it by 8%, and obtainthe capital requirement for the loan. The riskweight isdefined asa function of PD and LGD(and M). The function for the risk weights dependson the class of risk assets. So far, one function hasbeen defined for loans to enterprises, banks andgovernments, and another for loans to individuals.
For the capital requirement (EK) on a corporate
loan, the following formulasapply in the IRBapproach:
(1) EK = risk-weighted asset x 8% = EAD x risk
weight (RW) % x 8%.
RW iscalculated asfollows :(2) RW (LGD; PD) = min {LGD/50 x BRW (PD);
12.5 x LGD}.
16
BRW isthe benchmark ris k weight which dependson PD and which assumes an LGD of 50% and anaverage residual maturity of three years. In the IRBapproach, a standard residual maturity M of threeyears is assumed. M does not explicitly enter intothe calculation of the risk weights, but was impliedin the calibration.
(3) BRW(PD) = 976.5 x N(1.118 x G(PD) + 1.288) x
(1 + 0.0470 x (1 – PD)/PD
0.44).17
N is the distribution function of a standard normaldistributed random variable and G the attendantinverse cumulative distribution function for astandard normal random variable N
–1.
When using the advanced IRB approach, formula
(2) ismodified asfollows :(2’) RW (LGD; PD; M) = min{LGD/50 x BRW(PD) x
[1 + b(PD) x (M – 3)];12.5 x LGD}.
When using the advanced IRB approach, the residual
maturity M isdetermined for internal banking pur-poses as the maximum period of time the borrowermay use to meet his contractual obligations. M is atleast one year and no more than seven years, i.e.long-term liabilitiesenter into the equation with aresidual maturity of no more than seven years. Thus,in the advanced IRB approach, M isnot given astandard definition of three years like in the founda-tion IRB approach; instead, its actual value entersi n t ot h er i skw e i g h t .T h ei m p a c tt h er e si d u a lm a t u r -ity exertson the ris k weight dependson the functionb(PD). At pres ent, two optionsfor thisfunction arenow under discussion.
According to the marking to market model (MTM
model), b(PD) isasfollows :
b(PD) =0.0235 x (1 – PD)
PD0.44 + 0.0470 x (1 – PD).
According to the default mode model (DM model),
b(PD) is:
b(PD) = 7.6752 PD2– 1.9211 PD + 0.0774 for
PD < 0.05.
b(PD) = 0 for PD $0.05 (to avoid a negative factor
when adjusting the residual maturity).
The two proposed functions differ above all in

38weight for good borrowers (and consequently also
on the capital requirement). Debate iss till goingon asto which of the aforementioned approacheswill ultimately prevail (see the main body of thisarticle).
The PD of a loan to an enterprise is generally deter-
mined by the PD of the internal rating category as-signed to the borrower in both the foundation IRBapproach and the advanced IRB approach. If theone-year PD estimated by the credit institution it-self is below 0.03%, a minimum PD of 0.03% istaken as the basis for calculating the risk weight.When internally estimating the one-year PD, anaverage of many years is to be assumed.
In cases where a credit is secured by a guarantee
or a credit derivative, the PD for the collateralisedpart of the credit isreduced to PD*, where
(4) PD* = w x PD
B+ (1–w) x PD G.
PDBdenotesthe borrower’sPD, and PD Gthe PD of
the guarantor. Thus, a weighted average of theborrower’sPD and the guarantor’sPD isformed.w isgenerally 0.15; for guaranteesgiven by s over-eigns, central banks and commercial banks, whichare also given a zero weight in the standardisedapproach, w = 0. With the help of the w factor,the residual risk that remains with the borrowereven after transfer of the credit risk is backed bycapital. Ultimately, the result of a reduction in PD isa relaxation of the capital requirement if the guar-antor’sPD isles sthan that of the borrower. How-ever, thiscapital requirement isrelaxed only for ex-posures which are collateralised by guarantors orsellers of credit derivatives recognised under thestandardised approach. In the advanced IRB ap-proach, the bank itself estimates the degree oftransfer of risk from the borrower to the guarantoror seller of credit derivatives. It is not restricted to
the guarantorsor s ellersof credit derivativesrecog-nised under the standardised approach and is notrequired to apply a w factor.
If a bank uses the foundation IRB approach, the
national supervisor requires a 50% LGD for seniorunsecured claims and a 75% LGD for unsecuredsubordinated claims. By contrast, banks using theadvanced IRB approach use their own LGD esti-mates.
In the foundation IRB approach, the collateral in-
struments recognised in the standard approach (fi-nancial collateral) and collateral in the form ofcommercial or residential real estate are taken intoaccount. Other formsof collateral are not recog-nised by the foundation IRB approach as mitigatingcredit risk. Recognised collateral leads to a reduc-tion in LGD. For exposures secured by financial col-lateral, the adjusted LGD (LGD*) is calculated asfollows:
(5) LGD* = LGD x [1-(1-w) x C
A/E)] for E > C Aand
LGD* = w x LGD for E < C A
E isthe amount of the claim, and CA the currentvalue of the collateral after taking the collateralhaircutsinto account. w is0.15 or 0, dependingon the collateral. Haircutsare calculated the s ameway as in the standardised approach (see above).The use of commercial or residential real estatemay, in the foundation IRB approach, reduce theLGD by up to 10 percentage points(depending onthe current value of the collateral). LGD* iscalcu-lated as:
(6) LGD* = 50% for C/E #30%
LGD* = 40% for C/E > 140%

Bundesbank
MonthlyReport
April2001
39LGD* = {1-[0.2 x (C/E)/140%]} x 50% for
30% < C/E #140%
E isthe nominal expos ure and C the current value
of the collateral. In the advanced IRB approach abank may use all own LGD estimates, i.e. all typesof collateral are recognised if the additional min-imum requirementsare met and adequate timeseries information can be presented.
In the foundation IRB approach, EAD is, for on-
balance-sheet items, the book value of the loan,and for off-balance-sheet transactions (with the ex-ception of foreign-exchange, interest-rate, equityand commodity-related derivatives), the unusedcommitted credit line, multiplied by a credit conver-sion factor (CCF) of 75%. Excluded here are un-committed credit lines, facilities that are uncondi-tionally cancellable or facilitiesthat can be automat-ically cancelled, e.g. if a borrower’screditworthines sdeteriorates. In the advanced IRB approach, EADsbased on own estimates of CCFs are allowed.
For foreign-exchange, interest-rate, equity and
commodity-related derivatives, as previously doneunder the mark-to-market method, a creditequivalent amount will be calculated made up ofreplacement costs plus an add-on for estimated fu-ture exposure depending on the type of productand the residual maturity.

43Theroleand
behaviourofGermanfundmanagersontheequitymarketInstitutional investors are playing an
increasingly important role on theequity markets. In Germany – as inmanyotherOECDcountries–thereisaclear trend towards the institutional-isation of asset management, a trendwhich has become even stronger sincethe start of the 1990s. This articleanalysestheroleandbehaviourofGer-manfundmanagersontheequitymar-ket. It is based on a representativewritten questionnaire to which mostGerman equity fund managers re-sponded. The results show that fundmanagers tend to base their decision-making mainly on enterprise-relateddata. Their investment behaviour isthus able to contribute to a more effi-cient price formation on the equitymarkets. On the other hand, there areclear limits to the use of arbitrage byinstitutional investors. Herding canalso lead to instability on the equitymarkets.
Introduction
Institutional asset management has long
played only a relatively minor role in Ger-many. But thisisgradually changing. At theend of 1999 German credit institutions, insur-ance companiesand inves tment funds– themain componentsof the group of ins titution-al investors – already accounted for 43% oftotal domestic assets invested in shares, ascompared with 26% at the start of the1990s. By contrast, direct equity investment

tween 1990 and 1999 the growth recordedby investment companies was well aboveaverage. Thiswasaccompanied by a general-ly stronger inclination to invest in shares. Theshare of security-based funds’ assets investedin equitiesros e from around one-fifth in 1990to more than one-half at the end of 2000.Owing to the relative changes in asset pricesin favour of shares, this may overstatethe underlying trend. However, the above-average growth in receipts of share-basedand mixed security-based funds underlinesthe greater significance assumed by this formof investment (see the above chart).
“Institutionalisation” on the equity market is
being driven on two levels: private investorsare increasingly resorting to investment fundsinstead of investing directly, and institutional
investors such as banks and insurance com-panies are engaging in “institutionalisation inthe narrow sense” by expanding their invest-ment in special funds as opposed to directequity purchases. At the end of 2000 thespecial funds certificates held by credit institu-tionsand ins urance companiesamounted to381 billion and 3196 billion respectively. By
comparison, the reported portfolio invest-ment of credit institutions in equities amount-ed to 374 billion and that of insurance com-
paniesto 333 billion. These figures empha-
sise the high ranking that investment in spe-cial fundshasmeanwhile attained in thefinancial industry as compared with directequity holdings. Since the implementation ofthe first Financial Market Promotion Act in1990, it hasbeen eas ier to take advantage ofinvestment opportunities in special funds,with the result that banks and insurance com-panieshave increas ingly favoured thisinves t-ment instrument – also with regard to taxand balance-sheet advantages.
An explanation needsto be found for the
clear trend towardsthe intermediation ofcapital market investments, and especially ofequity investment, as in recent years the in-formation and transaction costs of directportfolio investment have fallen drastically insome cases, owing to rapid progress in thefield of information and communicationstechnology and the interlinking and compu-terisation of trading procedures. Evidently,however, conditionson the capital marketsfavour professional fund management. Insti-tutional asset management can create addedvalue by reducing risk. The potential of invest-

45ment fundsto s ecure value added ismultifa-
ceted. By outsourcing asset management, in-vestors can offset the problems caused bylack of time, information and know-how. In-vestment funds can generally achieve econ-omies of scale when analysing and trading se-curities. This enables investment strategieswhich use diversification as a means of largelyneutralising unsystematic risks related to indi-vidual equitiesto be devis ed and implement-ed far more favourably. By investing in funds,private s aversare thusable to inves t indirectlyin a number of shares from a broad range ofinvestment opportunities. This includes cap-ital marketsthat were previous ly difficult orimpossible to access. In addition, consolidat-ing investment money is often the only wayto permit complex and otherwise generallyprohibitively expensive hedging strategies in-volving the use of derivatives. A further ad-vantage of fund-based investment is derivedfrom the facility to exchange certificatesfor li-quidity asrequired, without having to liquid-ate specific assets, thereby changing thecomposition of the portfolio itself. Not least,the consolidation of investment money en-ablesinves tment fund managersto exertpressure on public limited companies.
Marketing strategies adopted by investment
fundsare often linked to the notion that fundmanagers are in possession of superior infor-mation, valuation modelsor inves tment tech-niques. It is thus, for example, the explicitlystated aim of a whole class of funds – hedgefunds– to track down dis tortionson the mar-ket and to turn them into profit by imple-menting investment strategies with specialrisk-return profiles.
1In fact, investors may usefund-based investment services primarily be-
cause they believe that the equity market pro-videss pecial profit-making opportunitiesandpresume that portfolio managers are able torealise above-average returns by drawing ontheir experience of the capital market andtheir analytical research activities in order toexploit undervaluationsand overvaluationseffectively. If thiswere s o, fund managerswould actively help to forge a stronger linkbetween priceson the financial market andtheir underlying economic fundamentals.

46are unlikely to be of any great significance.
The increase in “institutionalisation in thenarrow sense”, i.e. the outsourcing of assetmanagement within the financial industry tospecial funds, is better accounted for by taxand balance-sheet advantages.
2In addition,
special funds offer institutional investors suchasins urance companiesgreater flexibility interms of portfolio design – for instance, byusing options and futures to hedge assetitems.
The involvement of professional asset man-
agerscan, however, als o lead to informationasymmetries. Therefore, agreements aboutincentivesfor fund management that areconsistent with its objectives together withmeasures to enhance product transparency,such as standards governing the presentationof investment results, are necessary to boostinvestor confidence. Moreover, diseconomiesof scale may also occur. Clustering of invest-ment money, especially if it is accompaniedby herding on the part of asset managers,could lead to a thinning-out of the corres-ponding trading side, thus jeopardising mar-ket depth and causing prices to fluctuatewidely. Moreover, institutional investors mostprobably prefer shares with particular fea-tures– for example, blue chipswith a highmarket capitalisation. Consequently, therecan be undesirable side-effects for smaller en-terprises with low market capitalisation ornew enterprises that do not have appropriateaccess to equity market financing. Institution-alisation also entails the risk of short-termismon the part of institutional investors.Focusonprofessionalequityfund
management
The rapid, huge increase in the importance of
institutional investors would suggest the ad-visability of adopting a systematic approachto obtaining information about the invest-ment behaviour of this group of investors.We will focushere on s ome key featuresofthisbehaviour. The res ultsof our inves tiga-tions are based on a broad representativewritten survey which was conducted in sum-mer 2000, involving most of the fund man-agersdealing in equities(i.e. 278, or 52%) atvirtually all relevant investment companies lo-cated in Germany (60 out of 62 companies).Total assets managed by the survey’s respond-entsamounted, at the time of the s urvey, tosome 3400 billion, or 70%, of all assets held
in share-based and mixed security-basedfunds. Careful analysis of the data, includingthe examination of subgroups, reveals struc-turesand patternsthat are economicallyplausible and coherent. Since the fund man-agerss urveyed were granted anonymity,there is no reason to assume that they did notrespond to the best of their knowledge, offer-ing their own subjective assessments as well.Nor isthere any indication that the s urveyresults are distorted by selectivity in theresponses.

losses for some items can be offset against price gains in
others, whereas in the case of direct portfolio investment
the principle of the lower of cost or market is applied
strictly to each individual item.

47Detailsofthesurveyresults
The typical German equity fund manager is
35 yearsold and hasbeen working in thatfield for more than five years. He managessome 3850 million worth of equities. Most of
the fund managerswho took part in the s ur-vey (59%) had a university degree in eco-nomics or business administration and morethan half (54%) had completed two to threeyearsof profes s ional training in banking ora comparable training programme. Over one-quarter (27%) had also qualified as financialanalysts. Almost 71% of fund managershave full responsibility for taking decisions, al-though these must be in keeping with the in-vestment strategy prescribed by the invest-ment company or group; a further 14%make joint decisions with their colleagues. Asa rule, 15% make fully independent deci-sions, i.e. without any investment strategyconstraints imposed by the investment com-pany. In the context of their investment man-date, fund managersgenerally focusfirs t andforemost on blue chips. They therefore definetheir investment strategy as targeting growthrather than value.
4Furthermore, they claim
to follow more of a bottom-up than a top-down approach, i.e. they tend to analyse in-dividual shares independently of one anotherrather than to review marketsand s ectorsbe-fore assessing individual shares in the sectorsconcerned. According to the information pro-vided by the respondents in the survey, index-tracking plays a substantial role.Marketefficiencyandinvestment
philosophy
Whether fund managerspurs ue a more ac-
tive or a more passive investment style de-pends on their philosophy. Passive investmentstrategies such as index-linked investmentpoliciesare likely to be bas ed on the viewthat significant pricing errors on equity mar-ketsare a rare occurrence.
5According to this
criterion, the value added which passivelymanaged fundsare able to offer their inves t-ors consists primarily in reducing price risks bymeans of broad risk diversification and pos-sibly by hedging strategies related to portfolioitems. By contrast, active fund managementaimsat realis ing above-average returnsonequity investment, i.e. at “beating the mar-ket”. The type of value added that activefundsoffer their inves torsisthusderivedfrom the deliberate exploitation of supposedinformation advantages. The surveyresponses confirm the fact that Germanequity fund managersgenerally perceive theirmain task as being to pursue above-averageshare price increases. Measured on a scaleranging from 0 (irrelevant) to 5 (criterionplaysa major role), thisobjective received anaverage score of 4.6. Value added achievedby implementing diversification strategies evi-dently plays a significant, if subordinate, role.
4A value-oriented investment approach favours shares
with a relatively low valuation, while a growth-oriented
approach favours shares with a significant potential for
earningsgrowth. Thisismore of a practical dis tinction

possible to introduce index funds which fully replicate

With regard to the nature of equity markets,
virtually all fund managers(92%) agree thatinformation efficiency isinadequate. A clearmajority of 70% are of the opinion that pri-cing errors will also persist in the longer termbecause the market takes full note of newtrendsand developmentsonly after s ometime haselaps ed. Rather than new informa-tion being immediately reflected in marketprices, its impact is only gradual. The notionthat short-term share price distortions mightbe introduced asa res ult of initially inappro-priate responses to new information on thepart of investors is considered by 58% of therespondent fund managers to be of second-ary importance. Only a few investors (8%)ascribe a comparatively high degree of effi-ciency to the equity market and considershares to be valued correctly on the whole.On balance, German fund managerss ee ac-tive asset management as having consider-able potential.
WaysofacquiringinformationActive fund managerswho perceive opportun-
ities for profit in inappropriately assessed sharepriceshave to analys e the data and informa-tion available to them as a basis for devisingprofit-making strategies. On the other hand,they may also endeavour to secure informa-tion advantages. According to the results of
the survey, most fund managers consider thekey to successful fund management as lying inthe appropriate analysis of the informationavailable (43%) and, to a slightly lesser extent,in their own research activities (40%). How-ever, it isnot clear which of thes e two isthepreferred option. Thismay be becaus e it canbe relatively expensive for fund managers toconduct their own analyses and research andthey are therefore dependent on the capacitiesof the investment company concerned.
The way in which information isdis s eminated
among market playersiss ignificant for thestability of the financial markets, as it can pro-duce exaggerated and unbalanced reactionswhich it isdifficult to counter, even in part, byfundamental arbitrage. The potential for con-tagion among institutional investors may beexamined by investigating fund managers’preferencesin termsof s ourcesof informa-tion. According to the survey, fund managersconsider their discussions with managementand industry experts to be the most import-ant source of information for their work (seethe chart on page 49). At the same time,“second-hand” information is also of relative-ly major importance, with colleaguesand themedia being ranked second and third. This in-creases the likelihood of contagion derivingfrom information exchanged by investors orgroups of investors. In addition, profit projec-tionsfor public limited companiesgenerallyplay a greater role than macroeconomic fore-casts – which is hardly surprising as invest-ment decisions on the equity market, asalready indicated, are based primarily onbottom-up analyses. It is mainly the “second-

49hand” forecasts which are consulted – pri-
marily those made by analysts from otherinvestment firms. Moreover, to observe port-folio investments by other market players isconsidered less significant, but not irrelevant.Thus, in the fund managers’ own estimation,there isan inherent tendency to purs ue in-vestment strategies which are tuned to thetrading activitiesof other players .
MethodsofequitymarketanalysisIf active portfolio managers are consistent in
their analysis of the equity market, they gravi-tate towardsthos e methodsof analys iswhichare in keeping with their basic conception ofhow the equity market functions, i.e. of howprice-efficient it is. They may therefore regardtechnical analysis as profitable, especially formarketsfor which, in their view, the adjus t-
ment of pricesto fundamental s upply and de-mand factorsisrelatively inelas tic or whereoverreactionsoccur. Other quantitative analyt-ical approacheshelp to determine efficientlydiversified portfolios based on risk-return fore-casts as well as to make econometric estimatesof equity returns using single and multi-factormodels. By contrast, fundamental analysis, bynature, aimsat determining the intrins ic valueof an equity investment solely on the basis ofeconomic determinants. Such determinantsare not based on past price trends but on cri-teria such as corporate profits, dividends andinterest rates. Those who use fundamental an-alyses are entitled to assume additional returnsonly if their evaluation schemes indicate thatmarket pricesdo not fully reflect generally ac-cessible, relevant information.In order of importance 1

50In practice, portfolio managerstend to em-
ploy different evaluation strategies in parallel.For instance, quantitative instruments may beused to pre-select securities from a range ofinvestment opportunities, while individualchoicesare ultimately made in accordancewith the results of fundamental analysis.However, on balance, fundamental analysisplaysby far the mos t important role. On ascale of 0 to 5, it scored an average of 4.2,whereas technical analysis scored only 2.6.Only just under one-half of all fund managersrefer to econometric and portfolio optimisa-tion models; in general, they are consideredrelatively unimportant (1.2 and 1.1 respect-ively). With regard to the forecast horizon,fundamental analyses are evidently con-sidered particularly suited to identifying theyield potential of equity investment over themedium term. The choice of a time horizonof roughly one year suggests that fund man-agersconcentrate on corporate earningses ti-matesfor the financial year to come. Quanti-tative methods seem to be used primarily inthe analysis of short-term fluctuations; theforecast horizon for technical analysis aver-ages just eight weeks, while that adopted forportfolio optimisation approaches and econo-metric models is roughly six months.
Decision-makingmethodologyA major task in institutional asset investment is
to position the decision-making process be-tween a rules-bound and a purely discretionaryinvestment policy. For example, independentinvestment consultancy firms, which are in-creasingly being commissioned by credit insti-tutionsand ins urance companiesto choos esuitable investment managers, place great em-
phasis on consistent and rigorously imple-mented investment strategies. The advantageof a rule-based decision-making procedure,which in practice isgenerally referred to asstructured portfolio management, is that it en-ables the establishment of a systematic, com-prehensible and relatively objective investmentprocess. However, reduced decision-makingflexibility and a narrower discretionary latitudehave their drawbacks. Such approaches invari-ably lead to non-optimal decisions if unexpect-ed factorsand dis continuitiesoriginating inthe structure of the firm or in the economy asa whole intervene.
The survey results show that only 23% of
fund managers engage in systematic, stand-ardised analysis and then apply a fixed deci-sion rule. By contrast, 47% reserve for them-selves the greatest possible degree of flexibil-ity when taking an investment decision. Theytend to analyse equities in a manner depend-ent on the current market situation, making ageneral judgement only after a personal ap-praisal. Of the managers surveyed, 30% alsomake investment decisions after a final per-sonal appraisal, albeit only after systematicequity analysis.
HedgingandriskmanagementstrategiesFurther investment decision rules may be in-
ferred from strategies designed to limit mar-ket risks. Only those funds which gear theirinvestment strategies consistently to indicescan probably afford to disregard this object-ive. The results of the survey indicate thatfund managersmake only limited us e of op-

51tionsor futuresashedging s trategies(aver-
age score 2.2). Rather, depending on theirreading of the general market situation, theyadjust the ratio of equities to cash in theirportfolios(3.1). Dynamic hedging s trategiesare intended to limit losses in the portfolio’svalue in the event of a general market down-turn by tying the ratio of equitiesto cas h andbonds to the general stock market trend. Es-pecially since the stock market crash of 1987,these rules have been held responsible forexerting a destabilising effect on stock mar-ket price trendson account of their impliedpro-cyclical orientation. To judge from thedata supplied by the fund managers sur-veyed, such hedging strategies do not cur-rently play a major role in Germany (1.0).Stop-loss strategies are sometimes used toprotect the value of individual equities, mean-ing that a drop in market price to or below apre-determined level leadsto the abandon-ment of the corresponding investment pos-ition. Stop-loss strategies are thus static andlinked to the general development of thestock market. It is not the analysis of newfundamental information which promptsthedecision, but rather the market developmentitself. Generally speaking, the fund managerssurveyed also considered this rule to be ofonly minor relevance (1.6).
Remunerationincentivesand
performancecontrol
Remuneration incentivesand control meas -
uresin the inves tment companiesare likely toinfluence fund managers’ investment deci-sions. The optimal solution for institutional in-vestors may well be to adapt, by and large, tothe general market trend. Such behaviour is
logical if the risks and opportunities involvedin the investment decisions are viewed fromthe fund manager’spers pective. If the inves t-ed money entrusted to him achieves above-average performance, he can look forward toincreased job security, possibly a bonus and/or other professional advantages. By contrast,performance that iss ignificantly under parwould reduce the likelihood of a bonusandquite possibly also jeopardise the manager’sprofessional prospects.
The survey results indicate that, within invest-
ment companies, the performance of fundmanagersisapprais ed, on average, onceevery three monthsin the light of the growthin value of the investment sums entrusted tothem. However, the average ismis leading inthat it masks considerable differences.Whereas44% of the fund managerss ur-veyed are appraised on the basis of their fundperformance no more than once a year, one-third have a monthly appraisal. Benchmarkindicesare clearly the preferred meansofcomparing fund performance (average scoreof 4.5). Measurements of fund performancewhich aim to take explicit account of pricerisks incurred rarely use formal measures(1.7). Instead, it is apparently far more usualto take comparable fundsasa meas ure (3.2).Absolute fund performance also plays a role,albeit a subordinate one (2.2). Moreover, thesalaries of almost all fund managers includeperformance-based components; for the vastmajority of these managers, they are in theorder of up to 60% of their gross basic an-nual salary, with 30% being the median. Nor-mally, the primary criterion for bonusawards

52isrelative performance (s ee the above chart).
However, a subjective evaluative criterion, in-house appraisals by colleagues and superiors,isof relatively high s ignificance, too. Criteriawhich are more closely linked to the marketingsuccess of the investment company’s products,such as corporate profit, influx of investmentmonies, customer satisfaction, or the acquisi-tion of new customers, are less frequentlyused as a basis for assessment.
Pro-cyclicalinvestmentbehaviourThe question of whether fund managers tend
to act pro-cyclically, thereby reinforcing themarket momentum iscurrently being de-bated at length. One area of research has fo-cused on herding behaviour. As a general ob-servation, herding is to be understood as in-vestor behaviour that is at times independent
of the fundamentalsand unidirectional. Herd-ing reinforcesmarket trendsand thuspro-cyclical tendencies. Conventional empirical in-vestigations using market data have, to date,failed to distinguish adequately betweenspurious and intentional forms of herdingamong institutional investors. Unidirectionalinvestment behaviour clearly leads to correl-ated trading, but evidence of correlated trad-ing is not necessarily evidence of consciouslyimitative patternsof inves tment. The s urveyresults yield helpful supplementary informa-tion in this respect. They show that equityfund managers– albeit to differing degrees–largely take one index asa kind of bench-mark, which effectively synchronises invest-ment behaviour.

With a view to consciously imitative invest-
ment behaviour – in other words, herding –which is based on other market players’ sup-posed information advantages, fund man-agers were asked to appraise various buy sig-nals(s ee the above chart). On balance, ob-served purchasing activity by other institu-tional investors plays only a minor role. Tech-nical buying signals – such as an above-average rise in market prices accompanied byincreasing turnover, or a quoted price thathas stabilised at a level well below its peakvalues– which ultimately likewis e imply gear-ing to other market players’ trading activities,are considered to be rather more important.However, fund managers, as a rule, attach
significantly less importance to these market-driven buy signals than to criteria of a funda-mental nature. This is not altogether surpris-ing, given that the fund managersinter-viewed thought fundamental analysis farmore relevant.
An explanation of pro-cyclical behaviour in-
vokesthe fact that inves torsundertake re-valuationsonly gradually. Momentum s trat-egies, i.e. shifts into those stocks for whichpositive fundamental news is coming in,might then bring the quoted pricesclos erto the “fundamentally justified” value.

Rather, theycan be triggered by independent, yet similar,responses to the arrival of new information.In order of importance 1

54A common concern regarding the ongoing
institutionalisation of portfolio investment de-cisions presupposes an implicit trend towardslargely standardised patterns of investmentbehaviour or investment strategies. If thatwere the case, price adjustment processeswould be speeded up, entailing an increase inshort-term volatility. If, however, the arrival ofinformation itself provides the basis for mo-mentum strategies and supersedes a funda-mental assessment independent of marketdynamics, overreactions on the equity marketmay occur. According to the information sup-plied by the fund managers, their investmentdecisions are strongly influenced by such fac-torsascorporate announcementswhich arejudged to be positive (average score of 3.8)and higher profit expectationson the part ofanalysts for a certain public limited company(average score of 3.3). By contrast, their strat-egiestake almos t no account of dividend ex-pectations(s ee the chart on page 53). A trad-ing alternative isthat fund managersregard afundamentally low valuation by cross-marketor cross-sectoral comparison as a signal tobuy. Thisisthe only option determined by thevaluation level itself and not the direction ofmovement. Strictly speaking, only this type ofresponse is likely to be adopted by investorswho are pursuing a wholly fundamentalistapproach. In point of fact, thiscriterion does ,on average, have just a narrow lead over theothers in terms of fund managers’ decisionsto purchase equities (3.8). Fund managerstherefore appear to react just as readily topositive news itself as to its implications forthe relative pricing of equities.Furthervaluationcriteriagoverning
investmentdecisions
If institutional investors have other invest-
ment preferencesthan private inves tors , thetrend towardsus ing fundsto inves t indirectlyin shares will also have a corresponding effecton relative share prices. Several studies on in-stitutional investment behaviour suggest thatfund managersmake a deliberate effort tomeet certain secondary criteria. There is, forexample, a marked preference for large, li-quid shares. High liquidity in securities tradingreduces transaction costs. If derivatives arealso available as liquid tradable equity con-tracts, this may enable risk transformationand offer additional information on marketexpectationsand uncertainty. Whether cer-tain types of shares display such key stockcharacteristics or not probably only begins tobe important when the large volume and themore complex trading and hedging strategiesof institutional investors have been reached.Even so, the fund managers surveyed attrib-uted only minor significance to both tradingcosts, as measured by the bid/offer spread,and derivatives(average s core of 1.9 and 1.5respectively). Although the bid/offer spread isregarded asan indirect meas ure of s econdarymarket liquidity, adverse trading effects aris-ing from a lack of market depth might per-haps have been subsumed under the moregeneral criterion of market capitalisation,which isdeemed very relevant (3.7).
Unidirectional investment behaviour could
also be explained by the fact that fund man-agersare keen to protect their reputation.“Lone” decisions could turn out to be bad.

55Pro-cyclical behaviour may be the result of in-
vestor preferences for certain selection cri-teria which are considered indicative of super-ior stock quality. Unlike private investors,fund managershave to offer immediate jus ti-fication for their decisions as part of an in-ternal control and evaluation process; at thesame time, the law prescribes that they “ad-minister the trust for the joint accounts of theshareholders (i.e. holders of certificates) withthe caution of a responsible business man”.

Hence they may choose to apply conservativestock selection criteria. Besides market capit-alisation, which can be conceived as indicat-ing the size and popularity of a public limitedcompany, fund managersregard the fre-quency of public disclosure and the availabil-ity of independent analysts’ valuations as veryimportant (3.5). Thiss howsthat the amountof attention paid to particular stocks and theflow of information about them may have animpact on their value. Finally, although pastcorporate trendsand market performancehave no predictive value per se, general mar-ket acceptance can be regarded asa qualitycategory. According to the survey, fund man-agersattribute, on balance, high importanceto thiscriterion (3.6).
ThelimitsoffundamentalarbitrageThe extent to which investors contribute to
the price efficiency of the equity market isoften dependent on the methodsof financialanalysis that are used to justify their invest-ment decisions. This is unrelated to the po-tential forecasting advantages of one methodof analysis over another. For example, themore non-fundamental factorsdetermine theshare prices, the more appropriate the appli-
cation of technical analysis tools seems to aninvestor. However, such methods reveal amarked tendency not to take account ofunderlying economic data and to gearto market development itself. It cannottherefore be assumed that the use of non-fundamental techniquescontributesto asystematic correction of pricing errors on theequity market. By contrast, fundamental in-vestors take it as a signal to buy if the prices ofthe shares of a public limited company fallbelow their fundamental value and asa s ignalto sell if they are above it. The fact that thereare many mainly fundamental investors doesnot, however, adequately determine financialmarket stability. Fundamentalist fund man-agerscould deter from arbitrage becaus e theyperceive a risk of further incorrect valuationarising from the dominance of endogenousmarket forcesreleas ed by non-fundamentalis ts(“noise-trader” risk). Furthermore, fund man-agersrun the ris k of enforced liquidation ifcustomers start to withdraw their money. If“fundamentalists” take advantage of arbi-trage possibilities anyway, and if they do notpromptly record a success, liquidations canresult in worse pricing errors on the markets orfinancial crises.
The survey results help to gauge the potential
for fundamental arbitrage. Of the fund man-agers surveyed, 30% could be seen as pri-marily fundamentalist. More than 85% ofthem hold the view that investors take toolong to recognise new trends and develop-

However, when these fund man-agerswere as ked how long they would holdon to a portfolio strategy if the marketsturned against them and underperformancebecame significant, the response was justover three monthson average. Les sthan one-quarter of fundamentalists indicated theywould maintain it for six months, and lessthan one-eighth referred to at least one year(see the above chart). The survey results castfurther doubt on whether fundamentalistscould last the course.
All survey participants were asked to rank dif-
ferent scenarios in terms of their potential forgenerating particular tension during profes-sional decision-making. Almost all fund man-
agerscited market dynamicsasthe mos t like-ly source of nervousness – especially if pricesare sliding rapidly but even, to a considerableextent, if they are rising rapidly. Fundamental-ists were the only group to have “voted”with a slight majority for economic and com-pany-related newsasthe s econd-rankedsource of nervousness. Fund managers there-fore primarily follow market dynamics, includ-ing those who adhere strictly to fundamentalswhen investing. All in all, these empirical ob-servations support the view that there arelimits to institutional investors’ use of arbi-trage on the equity markets. This is in keepingwith approachesbas ed on behavioural finan-cial theory.
Conclusion
As increased use is made of investment funds
for the purpose of investing in stocks andshares, professional asset managers havemoved to centre stage on the equity markets.At the same time, periods of high volatility onthe marketss eem to have become more fre-quent, although there isno clear evidence ofhigher volatility over the longer term. The de-bate over the impact of institutional investorson financial market stability is gainingground, attracting not least the attention ofcentral banks. Therefore, this article hasmade use of a representative survey to ana-lyse key aspects of institutional investmentprocesses. The results endorse the view thatinstitutional investors can generally contrib-ute to more efficient stock market pricing.Fund managersdemons trate a clear prefer-

barriers and the lifting of political re-strictions,theindividual nationalecon-omies have become a strongly inte-grated world economy. Globalisationhas become a guideline for many en-terprises. In the contest for sales mar-kets and production advantages, theyare attempting to establish a world-wide presence by setting up branchesand subsidiaries abroad and often bytaking over existing foreign firms.Even big companies which alreadyhave an extensive international pres-ence arenow merginginto evenlargercorporate entities with the aim of se-curing a leading position on the worldmarket.

owesmuch to the activities , particularly inthe past few years, of a handful of globalplayersin Germany that are very much in thepublic eye. At the end of 1999 German directinvestment abroad accounted for aroundone-sixth of the aggregate gross assets of theGerman economy vis-bR,,4-vis non-residents atthat time.
1The inward primary direct invest-
ment, i.e. the participating interests in Ger-man enterprises held by non-residents,reached the sum of 3284 billion at end-
1999; thiswasmore than three-and-a-halftimesashigh asthe level ten yearsearlier.These foreign-held corporate assets made upone-eighth of all German liabilitiesto non-residents. On balance Germany has for longbeen a “net creditor” in termsof foreign dir-ect investment (FDI). In other words, Germandirect investment abroad exceeds foreign dir-
ect investment in Germany – such an out-ward FDI biasistypical of virtually all highlydeveloped industrial countries.
Of the total amount of 3392 billion of pri-
mary German direct investment stocksabroad at end-1999, 3311 billion – that isal-
most 80% – was held in the form of equitycapital. Thisparticipatory capital waslargelyinvested in foreign firms in the form of liablecapital, with 3257 billion accounted for by
the combined nominal capital and capital re-serves attributable to the German sharehold-ers(s ee table on thispage). The 371 billion

The capital structure of the primary foreign
direct investment stocks in Germany was verydifferent. The equity capital held in Germanfirmsby foreign inves torsisfar s maller thanGerman participating interests in enterprisesoutside Germany. At 3127 billion, the pri-
mary foreign equity capital invested in Ger-many at the end of 1999 wasonly two-fifthsaslarge asthe corres ponding German partici-pating interests abroad. The nominal capitalheld by non-resident investors amounted toonly 347 billion. The capital reserves alloc-
able to foreign shareholders in the balancesheets of German direct investment enter-prises at end-1999 came to 384 billion. The
prorata revenue reserves and profits brought
forward were very small in both absolute andrelative terms, at 316 billion. Thisphenom-
enon appears to have several causes. Aboveall, until 1998 it was possible under Germantax law to release revenue reserves accumu-lated in earlier yearsat a lower rate of corpor-ation tax. Foreign shareholders made abun-dant use of this facility; in recent years Ger-man direct investment enterprises disbursedrather substantial dividend payments to theirforeign owners. For the rest, German ac-counting rulespermit a very cautiousap-proach to disclosed earnings which tends tounderstate the true level of profitability. Pro
ratalosses brought forward and losses for the
financial year cut aggregate foreign equityholdingsin German enterpris esby 334 billion
at end-1999. The principal method by whichforeign investors – in contrast to German dir-ect investors abroad – provided financial re-
sources to their corporate holdings in Ger-many wasthrough the granting of loans . Atthe end of 1999 direct loansfrom s harehold-erstotalled 356.5 billion, while loansfrom
other affiliated enterprises amounted to asmuch as 3100 billion. The relatively high level
of credit financing of direct investment enter-prises in Germany by non-residents is explain-able not least by the fact that this type offinancing attractsmore favourable taxtreatment than direct capital links.

structure of large enterprise groups and con-glomerates– es pecially where internationallinks are concerned. The establishment ofsuch an administrative apex focuses thegroup’s management structure and simplifiesthe logistics; in some cases, tax breaks orother locational advantagesals o lie behindthe establishment of a holding company. Ofthe primary German direct investment stocksabroad at the end of 1999, more than one-third ( 3144 billion) wasconcentrated in s uch
holding companies. The role of holding com-paniesin inward FDI iseven greater. At end-1999 holding companiesaccounted for morethan 60% ( 3173 billion) of FDI in Germany.
In order to obtain an accurate picture of the
composition of direct investment stocks,broken down by firm size, location and busi-ness activity, it is useful to “look past” theseholding companiesby, in effect, dis regardingthem. For the purpose of these direct invest-

62ment studies this is achieved through a very
simple method of consolidation. The equitystakes held via such dependent holding com-paniesare added to the primary participatinginterests, at the same time, the shares in theintermediate holding companiesare ignoredso as to avoid duplication. This method ofpresentation has a drawback, however: italters the aggregate volume of disclosed cor-porate assets to some extent. As can be seenfrom the chart on thispage, thismethod
modifiesGerman FDI abroad only marginally,raising the total by 313 billion to 3405 bil-
lion. Thisismainly due to the fact that add-itional financial resources were procured bythe foreign holding companieson the inter-national financial marketsand then madeavailable to the affiliated enterprises. How-ever, the inclusion of secondary participationsinstead of the dependent holding companieshasa much greater impact on the level of for-eign direct investment in Germany. Calcu-lated in this way, non-residents’ combinedprimary and secondary direct investmentstocks at end-1999 were 359 billion smaller
than the total based solely on primary directinvestments (including in dependent holdingcompanies). One of the main reasons for thisdiscrepancy is presumably that the branchesand subsidiaries of the holding company inGermany “paid” higher pricesfor the acquis i-tion of their domestic participating intereststhan isreflected in the balance s heetsof thesubordinate direct investment enterprises.Owing to undisclosed reserves, particularly,the consolidated primary and secondary cor-porate assets held by foreign shareholders inGermany tend to be understated.
The following analysis is based solely on the
consolidated figures for primary and second-ary direct investment combined.

63practice direct investment is a domain of
large enterprises. This can clearly be seen ifthe stock of direct investment is analysed interms of the respective shares attributable toindividual investors and direct investment en-terprises. Of the 8,304 German investors inother countries recorded in the statistics atthe end of 1999, the ten largest investorsalone in termsof inves tment volume heldone-third ( 3137 billion) of all German direct
investment abroad. The 50 largest individualinvestors accounted for more than one-half(3230 billion) of the total, while the 100 big-
gest investors between them made up no lessthan two-thirdsof the aggregate volume ofinvestment in foreign enterprises. With re-spect to the size of individual corporate in-vestments abroad, too, a heavy concentrationon large-scale investment projects is appar-ent. Thus the ten largest direct investmententerprises abroad accounted for one-sixth ofGerman firms’ aggregate FDI, the 50 largestprojectsmade up 30%, while the 100 larges tinvestment projects had a share of almosttwo-fifths, or 3157 billion, in total outward
FDI of German companies.
A similar structure can be seen in non-
residents’ direct investment in German enter-prises. The ten largest foreign stocks of assetsin German firmsat end-1999 made up one-fifth of the total, the 50 largest accounted forjust under two-fifths ( 383 billion), while the
100 biggest inward investment projects madeup almost one-half ( 3104 billion) of total pri-
mary and secondary foreign direct investmentin Germany.In the case of direct investment – in contrast
to portfolio investment – it is very clear that inthe vast majority of cases the investors wishto exert a dominant influence over the directinvestment enterprises. At the end of 1999more than 70% of German FDI abroad wasaccounted for by direct investment enter-prises which were wholly owned by Germancompanies; similarly, two-thirds of all directinvestment enterprises were 100% German-owned. A further 14% of the outward FDIstock (and 20% of the direct investment en-terprises) had a German participation of be-tween 50% and 100%. Only one-seventh ofall cases (and roughly the same proportion oftotal German direct investment abroad) re-lated to German minority interests in foreigndirect investment enterprises, defined as atleast 10% of the capital shares or votingrights. Looking at inward FDI, no less thanthree-quartersof the direct inves tment enter-prises and around 60% of foreign direct in-vestment in Germany were solely owned bynon-resident investors. Almost 85% of thestock of inward FDI and 91% of the numberof direct investment enterprises in Germanyheld by non-residents at the end of 1999 con-cerned participationsof more than 50% ofthe capital shares or voting rights.
If the German firmsthat are s ubject to for-
eign influence are broken down by legalform, it becomesapparent (ascan be s een inthe chart on page 64) that four-fifthsof in-ward FDI stocks at the end of 1999 was in-vested in corporations, of which just underone-third were Aktiengesellschaften (AGs),

billion, the amount of foreign direct invest-ment in dependent branchesin Germany wasrelatively insignificant. 333 billion, or 15% of
inward FDI, was invested in partnerships. Ifthe relative numbersof direct inves tment en-terprises are considered, it becomes clear thatforeign participating interests in German pub-lic limited companieswere only of minor im-portance owing to the small magnitude ofstock market capitalisation in Germany. Atthe end of 1999 only 407 out of a total of12,597 enterprises in Germany with foreigncapital involvement were organised in theform of plcs.

2Public limited companies are especially significant in
calculating FDI stocks. At the international level it is desir-
able to value cross-border corporate assets on the basis
of “market prices”, which are very hard to determine for
companies. In Germany the direct investment stocks are
calculated on the basis of the prorata direct investment
positions derived from the balance sheets of the direct in-
vestment enterprises, which thus represent realistic and
current values. However, public limited companies that
are listed on stock exchanges are to be valued additional-
ly in future according to current stock market prices.GermanFDIin

65dom ( 340 billion), France ( 323 billion) and
the Netherlands( 321 billion). The sectoral
profile of the corporate assets in the EU re-gion held by German investors was disparate.Whereas the financial industry was the sectorfavoured most in the UK, Belgium andLuxembourg, direct investments in the manu-facturing or wholesale/retail trade sectorspredominated in Austria, France and Spain.
In international discussions – as well as in the
GATS
3talksof the World Trade Organis ation
– key data of direct investment enterprises(number, turnover, number of employees) areassuming increasing importance, especiallywith respect to assessing the degree of“openness” of economies. For example, thenumber of direct investment enterprises inthe individual direct investment countriesshows that, despite the trends towards glob-alisation, geographical proximity still plays animportant role for German investors – aboveall for the vast number of small and medium-sized enterprises. Of the more than 29,000foreign firmswith German capital linksre-corded at the end of 1999, almost 10%alone were located in Germany’simmediateneighbour France. The turnover and numberof employeesin French direct inves tment en-terprises were likewise the highest within thegroup of EU countries(s ee table on page 66).
Three-fifthsof all inward FDI ( 3135 billion)
was held by investors from EU countries. Thepredominance of investors from the Nether-landswasvery s triking in thiscontext: theirassets in German firms added up to 345.5
billion, which wasone-fifth of total FDI inGermany held by non-residents. This is doubt-less attributable to the importance of the
Netherlandsasa location for internationalholding companies. Many investors – includ-ing some domiciled outside the EU – havegroup headquartersin the Netherlandswhichmanage corporate holdingsworldwide. Thisbecomes evident if FDI is assigned to thecountry of domicile of the ultimate beneficialowner rather than that of the primary foreigninvestor (see table on page 68). On this view,the stock of FDI accounted for by investorsdomiciled in the Netherlandsfallsdramaticallyby more than half to 321 billion. Thismeans
that at end-1999 the participating interests ofDutch firmsin German direct inves tment en-terprises were smaller in the aggregate thanEnd-1999

held 325 billion.
Graded by the number of participating inter-
ests held, Dutch investors had a stake in2,577 enterprises in Germany at end-1999(but only in 1,784 enterprises when classifiedaccording to the ultimate beneficial owner),which corresponds to approximately one-third of all FDI in Germany by investors fromEU countries. The associated direct invest-ment enterprises employed a total of439,000 (254,000) people, which worksoutat almost one-quarter of the total workforceof firmsin Germany with foreign capital links .Investors from France and the United King-dom, taken together, operated about thesame number of direct investment enterprisesin Germany, employing a combined work-force of 347,000 persons.
Among the group of industrial countries out-
side the EU in which German firms had in-vested, the United States was by far the mostpreferred nation (accounting for 3129 billion
of German FDI), which isa cons equence notleast of some recent very large mergers. TheGerman investors focused on the US manu-facturing sector ( 354 billion) – within that
sector mainly on motor vehicle manufacture(321 billion) and the chemical industry ( 320
billion) – and on the financial intermediationsector ( 350 billion). German firmsheld par-
ticipationsin the United States , which istheworld leader in information and communica-tion technology, in 3,398 enterprises employ-ing 792,000 people. In 1999 German invest-orsearned one-third of their total turnoverfrom foreign corporate holdingsfrom US
firms.
Similarly, the lion’ss hare of inward FDI eman-
ated from the United States( 352 billion); US
investors held interests in just under 2,000direct investment enterprises in Germany em-ploying a total of nearly
1bR,82million people. If
inward FDI is classified by the country ofdomicile of the ultimate beneficial owner, theindustrial nations outside the EU, at 3100 bil-
lion, accounted for a larger share of corpor-ate assets in Germany than did investors fromEU countries( 395 billion). Once again, US in-
vestors account for the bulk of this total; theiraggregate FDI in Germany was 313 billion
higher according to thisdefinition.

69339 billion. Thismade up les sthan 10% of
their total outward FDI. Less than one-tenthwasheld in African developing countries .German FDI in the (Latin) American develop-ing countrieswasfar larger. More than halfof German direct investment in this categoryof nationswasinves ted in countriesbelong-ing to thisgeographical group. In Brazil alonethere were 498 enterprises at end-1999 inwhich German partnershad an aggregate in-volvement of 37 billion. In Mexico German
investors made use of the country’s open pol-icy towardsforeign inves torsand free-tradeagreements(s uch asNAFTA). At the end of1999 their direct investments in Mexicototalled 35 billion and were distributed
between 273 firms, mainly in the manu-facturing sector.
Almost half of the direct investment enter-
prises in developing countries in which Ger-man investors were involved were located inAsia (including Oceania); the volume of fundsinvested in the region at the end of 1999 was314 billion. A particularly noticeable feature
wasthe high number of employees(111,000)in the 239 enterprises in India which had Ger-man capital links. Similar relations can beseen in some other developing countries inwhich comparatively low wage ratesencour-age labour-intensive production methods.
Breakdownbyeconomicsector
A widespread tendency that has been evident
of late isthat the management bodiesofinternational corporate groupshave reorient-ed their business policy. They have increasing-ly abandoned strategies aimed at diversifica-
tion and instead are focusing on their corebusiness. This is mirrored in the field of FDIactivity by the preference shown for horizon-tal mergers, meaning that investors mostlyacquire capital stakes, including abroad, infirms in the same economic sector. Given theever-shorter product life-cycles, this enablesthem to market new goodsfas ter worldwide;in thisway the high res earch and develop-ment costs can be amortised more rapidly. Inthe field of industrial manufacture, concen-tration within one branch of industry permitsa high unit output; intermediate productscanbe manufactured at the cheapest location ineach case and then brought together for finalassembly at a site near the customer – as iswidespread practice in motor vehicle manu-facturing.
Thisexplainswhy nearly two-thirds( 3100 bil-
lion) of the total FDI of German manufactur-ers( 3158 billion) at end-1999 wasinves ted
in foreign industrial enterprises. A further 323
billion wasappropriated for dis tribution out-lets (which are far less capital-intensive) and326 billion wasinves ted in “other financial
intermediaries”. At the end of 1999 the col-lective direct investments abroad of Germancredit institutions totalled 355 billion – virtu-
ally exclusively through equity links withcredit institutions in other countries ( 342 bil-
lion) and with other financial institutionsabroad ( 310 billion). By contrast, little more
than two-thirdsof the 315 billion in corpor-
ate assets outside Germany held at the samejuncture by German insurance enterpriseswas placed in foreign insurance companies.

70If the sectoral breakdown of the German dir-
ect investment enterprises abroad is analysed,it is conspicuous that at the end of 1999 lessthan 40% ( 3152 billion) of German invest-
ors’ outward FDI in a total of 9,345 enter-prises abroad was invested in manufacturingfirms(s ee table on page 72). At over 3500
billion, these enterprises generated aroundhalf of German corporate investors’ aggre-gate foreign turnover. Almost 2.5 million per-sons were employed in this sector. The chem-ical industry was a focal point of German in-vestors’ interest, accounting for 345 billion
of direct investments. German investors havetraditionally shown a marked preference forinvesting in foreign manufacturers of chem-icals and chemical products, not least so thatthey can make better use of research capaci-tiesworldwide but als o in order to take ad-vantage of locational advantagesabroadwhere, for example, environmental protec-tion standards are less rigorous than in Ger-many.
The manufacture of motor vehiclesabroad
hasacquired great s ignificance within theframework of German foreign direct invest-ment; 337 billion wasinves ted in thisindus -
try at the end of 1999, while 640,000 peoplewere employed in the around 700 foreignautomobile firmswith German capital partici-pation. The foreign direct investment enter-prises of German investors also included asizeable share of manufacturers of electricalmachinery and apparatus(with an FDI s tockof316 billion) and of machinery and equip-
ment ( 312 billion); together they also ac-
counted for a large number of foreignbranches and subsidiaries (nearly 2,200).They had a combined workforce abroad of
more than
1bR,82million.
The relative importance attached by investors
to enhancing the opportunitiesto s ell theirown productsabroad when making their FDIdecisions can be gauged to some extent fromthe volume of assets invested in the whole-sale and retail trade sector. At 355 billion,
14% of German outward direct investmentwasplaced in dis tribution outletsabroad atthe close of 1999. With over 11,000 direct in-vestment enterprises, this sector was a keyarea of German FDI in termsof the numberof investment projects. The German whole-sale and retail trade enterprises abroad gener-ated turnover worth 3393 billion, or more
than one-third of the total turnover of alldirect investment enterprises abroad.
In the financial sector new opportunities for
direct investment were created through elec-tronic banking and e-commerce. Additionalmarket potential isemerging – es pecially inthe industrial countries – from new systemsof old-age provision for the population. Inthisfield, in particular, the provis ion of ins ur-ance services is closely linked to maintaining alocal presence, as fairly widely differing na-tional legal regulationshave to be obs erved.The liberalisation of financial markets has alsomade it easier for German investors to ac-quire enterprises abroad. For example, a sub-stantial stock of German FDI was accumu-lated up to the end of 1999 in foreign finan-cial intermediation enterprises amounting to3136 billion, which made up one-third of
total German FDI stocks abroad. 363 billion

stitutions”. At end-1999 some 2,146 foreignbranches and subsidiaries engaged in finan-cial intermediation were wholly or partlyunder German ownership, including 850“other financial intermediaries”, almost 500“insurance companies” and nearly 450“credit institutions”.
At the end of 1999 German investors had
interests worth 342 billion in the services sec-
tor
6of other countries spread across more
than 3,900 enterprises, which indicates agrowing significance of this sector. There wasa German involvement in 1,400 real estatefirmsand more than 1,300 firmscarrying out“other business activities” and employing86,000 people. At 313 billion, the amount of
FDI funds invested in these two sub-sectorswascomparatively s mall, however.
One noticeable feature of foreign direct in-
vestment in Germany is that inward invest-ment in the German manufacturing sectorhas a relatively small share (see the adjacentchart), especially if it is remembered that Ger-many is one of the leading industrial nations.On the other hand, it should be borne inmind that Germany hasfor long been a veryopen economic location with comparativelylow commercial barriers, so that having alocal production base is not absolutely essen-tial for foreign firms wishing to sell their prod-uctsin thiscountry. Moreover, the s tock offoreign industrial assets in Germany as shownin corporate balance sheets is probablyunderstated as they mostly relate to old es-tablished enterprises with considerable undis-closed reserves. At 379 billion, little morethan one-third of inward FDI wasinves ted in
the German manufacturing sector at end-1999 in a total of 3,300 enterprises; however,they accounted for almost half the turnoverof firmsin Germany with foreign capital linksand employed more than 1 million persons.The stock of foreign direct investment in Ger-many was more widely dispersed across theindividual manufacturing industries in Ger-many than wasthe cas e for German FDIabroad. But for foreign investors, too, FDI inthe chemical industry was of major import-ance, accounting for 319 billion of assets at
371 production sites; at 347 billion, the firms
in this industry generated the highest turn-End-1999

632 firmsin the mechanical engineering in-dustry in Germany had a foreign capital in-volvement (with an inward FDI stock of 38
billion). At 345 billion, foreign investors re-
corded their second largest turnover in themanufacturing sector in Germany in themotor vehicle industry.
Wholesale and retail trade outlets were import-
ant for foreign investors in Germany, too. Theyheld participating interests in almost 5,000 dir-ect investment enterprises in this sector which,at332 billion, accounted for 14% of inward
foreign direct investment. Distribution estab-lishments in Germany with foreign capital linksgenerated a turnover in 1999 of 3212 billion,
which (asin the cas e of German FDI abroad)made up a third of the total turnover of foreignbranches and subsidiaries.
At338 billion, foreign involvement in the fi-
nancial intermediation sector in Germany atthe end of 1999 wasvery low both abs olutelyand relatively. Thisinvolvement wass tretchedacross just under 450 enterprises in the finan-cial sector.
At the end of 1999 inward FDI in the services
sector totalled 368 billion and ranked second
after the manufacturing sector; in terms of thenumber of investment enterprises (2,722), thesector accounted for over one-fifth of all for-eign capital participationsin German firms .With a volume of 352 billion, foreign direct
investment in the almost 500 holding com-paniesin Germany wasparticularly s ignificant.These holding companies had no equity inter-ests in Germany that were subject to reporting
requirements, so they were not included in theconsolidation process described at the begin-ning of thisarticle. In recent yearsGermanyhasbecome a popular location for foreignholding companies for tax reasons; one of thekey attractionswasdoubtles sthat operatinglosses made by foreign-owned plants in Ger-many could be offset against German tax.However, thisfacility isbeing abolis hed by thenew Tax Relief Act. But other categoriesof s er-vice enterprises in Germany were also of inter-est to foreign investors since local personalcontactsare often deemed neces s ary for theprovision of services. Thus foreign corporateinvestors held over 1,100 direct investmententerprises in the services sub-sector “otherbusiness activities” in Germany, in which81,000 people were employed. The real estatesector likewise attracted many foreign in-vestors, with 690 direct investment enter-prises.
A further steep increase in both outward and
inward FDI linksisalready becoming apparentthrough recent corporate takeovers, althoughthese have only been recorded so far in thedirect investment transactions captured bythe balance of payment statistics for the year2000.

*These euro area retail bank interest rates should be used with caution and Member States. Furthermore, the national interest rates are not harmonised
for statistical purposes only, primarily to analyse their development over in terms of their coverage (new business and/or outstanding amounts), th e
time rather than their level. They are calculated as the weighted average of nature of the data (nominal or effective) or the compilation method. Thenational interest rates provided by the national central banks. The national country weights for the euro area retail bank interest rates are derived from
rates represent those rates that are currently available from national MFI balance sheet statistics or close proxies. The weights reflect thesources and which are judged to fit the standard categories. These national country-specific proportions of the relevant instruments within the eur o
rates have been aggregated to derive information for the euro area, in area, measured as outstanding amounts. The weights are adjusted monthly,some cases relying on proxies and working assumptions due to the so that interest rates and weights always refer to the same month. —1En-
