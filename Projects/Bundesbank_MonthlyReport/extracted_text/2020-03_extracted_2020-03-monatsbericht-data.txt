Economic conditions
Underlying trends
Germany is facing unprecedented challenges 
as a result of the rapid spread of the corona -
virus pandemic. It is the healthcare system that 
has the key part to play. The measures taken so 
far have the aim of containing the number of 
infections so as not to place too great a strain 
on the healthcare system, but they will also 
have massive implications for the economy. A 
slide into a marked recession is unavoidable. 
An economic recovery will set in only when the 
pandemic risk has been effectively brought 
under control. Against this backdrop, economic 
developments are characterised by unpreced -
ented uncertainty. The year got off to quite a 
positive start, with the hitherto weak pace of 
industrial activity picking up at the beginning of 
2020. Industrial output was up strongly and 
the orders situation showed a considerable im -
provement. According to the Ifo Institute, busi -
ness expectations in manufacturing were point -
ing upwards well into February. Domestic eco -
nomic activity, too, remained intact early in the 
year. This was indicated by the perceptible rise 
in retail sales in January and by a strong upturn 
in the construction sector, which was favoured 
by the mild weather. This overall picture sug -
gested that the two- speed growth in the Ger -
man economy was gradually receding and that 
its – previously weak – underlying trend was 
becoming stronger again. However, the pan -
demic has abruptly interrupted this develop -
ment. Amid all the uncertainty, its impact is 
likely to be severe, at least for the coming 
months. The data for most economic indicators 
reflect the situation prior to the coronavirus 
outbreak. They were largely collected before 
the worldwide escalation of the health risk, 
and the authorities in the key trading partner 
countries, but also in Germany itself, took far- 
reaching countermeasures. Current surveys 
suggest, however, that German firms are now suffering considerably under the effects of the 
pandemic. According to provisional Ifo survey 
results for March, economic sentiment in Ger -
many has deteriorated dramatically. This was 
mainly due to enterprises’ business expect -
ations, which saw an unprecedented fall. A 
number of available indicators with a particu -
larly short time lag, such as the strong decline 
in restaurant reservations and lower passenger 
numbers at Frankfurt airport, also point in this 
direction. The consequences of the pandemic 
are expected to have a massively detrimental 
impact on economic output, at least in the first 
half of the year. Economic activity is likely to 
decline considerably in many sectors, probably 
resulting in a perceptible underutilisation of 
capacity in the economy as a whole.
The pandemic and the measures adopted to 
contain it will hit the German economy through 
a variety of channels. First of all, direct eco -
nomic effects will become apparent in Ger -
many itself. In this respect, it is likely to be the 
more domestically oriented, consumer-  related 
services sectors, which have thus far supported 
economic activity, that will be most severely af -
fected. Hotels, restaurants and catering ser -
vices, the entertainment industry as well as 
trade fair operations and airlines are likely to 
suffer very strongly from declining demand and 
precautionary closures. Besides this, other busi -
nesses, too, are being afflicted by potential 
losses of work and sales due to protective and 
precautionary measures, such as the nation -
wide closures of schools and child day care 
centres. Added to this are external knock- on 
effects which will chiefly hit export businesses 
and thus industry. For example, demand for 
German exports in countries worst hit by the 
pandemic is likely to fall considerably. Further -
more, the cutback in production in countries 
that are particularly affected   means that there 
is the risk of supply shortages for key inputs. 
This might lead to production bottlenecks in 
Germany, too, even if there should be demand Emerging eco -

for the goods to be produced. All of the cited 
obstacles can trigger negative confidence and 
second- round effects in Germany. These knock- 
on effects are nevertheless being countered to 
a certain extent by Germany’s extensive social 
security system, the accommodative monetary 
policy measures adopted by the Eurosystem as 
well as the various measures taken by the Fed -
eral Government. The government’s quickly 
imple mented increase in short- time working is 
bolstering the available incomes of employees. 
Compensation under the German Protection 
against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz)  
could also have a stabilising impact in this 
respect . Extensive credit guarantees and tax 
defer rals are helping to safeguard the solvency 
of affected enterprises. Furthermore, the meas -
ures create confidence that the economic fall -
out from the crisis can be managed for society, 
the economy as a whole and for each individ -
ual. Above and beyond that, the Federal Gov -
ernment has announced additional measures 
to boost economic activity if the economic 
slowdown threatens to become entrenched. 
Germany’s public finances are well equipped 
for this.
Industry
German industrial output was up strongly in 
January 2020, being 2¾% higher than the pre -
vious month in seasonally adjusted terms. This 
was due partly to “bridging” days dampening 
output at the end of 2019, which may have led 
to bounce- back effects in the reporting month. 
The January figure was likewise up sharply 
(+1¾%) compared with the average of the last 
three months of 2019, with manufacturers of 
computers, electronic and optical products and 
German mechanical engineering firms report -
ing significantly higher output. There was an 
even stronger increase in output in the sector 
of repairs and installation of machinery and 
equipment. By contrast, output in the automo -
tive sector continued to decline markedly, al -
though there was a considerable expansion of 
capital goods production overall. Growth in Industrial output

intermediate goods was even more dynamic. 
This contrasted with consumer goods, where 
manufacturers had to contend with a notice -
able drop in output. This was chiefly due to a 
sharp decline in the manufacturing of pharma -
ceuticals.
The order situation of German industrial enter -
prises improved significantly in the early part of 
the year. Industrial orders in January were up 
very strongly on the month in seasonally ad -
justed terms (+5½%) and growth, at 3¾%, 
was still robust compared with the preceding 
quarter. Large- scale orders received on an 
irregu lar basis played a key part in this, but the 
inflow of orders picked up briskly even if these 
are left aside. In a regional breakdown, im -
pulses came mainly from abroad, with German 
industry reporting a considerable increase in 
orders from the euro area, for example. Orders 
received from non- euro area countries showed 
even stronger growth. By contrast, domestic 
demand for German industrial products was 
comparatively modest. With regard to the indi -
vidual sectors, manufacturers of computers, 
electronic and optical products experienced an 
extremely strong surge in orders; to a some -
what smaller extent this was also true of Ger -
man manufacturers of machinery and equip -
ment. The automotive industry received fewer 
orders, however. This was due to a lack of 
orders from Germany and the euro area, while 
demand for motor vehicles went up in non-  
euro area countries. These regional differences 
are probably related to stricter EU regulations 
pertaining to carbon emission targets. For this 
reason, front- loaded orders may have been 
lacking in January. Despite this, the intake of 
orders in the capital goods sector was up 
strongly overall. The increase in orders of inter -
mediate goods was even greater. By contrast, 
orders in the consumer goods industry re -
mained at the level of the previous quarter.
Nominal industrial turnover followed the buoy -
ant industrial output in January 2020 and was 
up strongly on its December level in seasonally 
adjusted terms (+1¾%). Turnover was also considerably higher than the average of the 
preceding three months (+1¼%). Broken down 
by industrial sector, there was a particularly 
strong growth of sales in the German mechan -
ical engineering sector. By contrast, motor 
vehicle  sales fell sharply, dampened mainly by 
weak business figures in Germany and in the 
euro area. Sales of capital goods were up con -
siderably overall, however. Furthermore, the 
consumer goods sector reported a similarly 
dynamic  sales development. Sales of intermedi -
ate goods were only marginally higher than 
their figure for the final quarter of last year. In 
regional terms, sales in Germany and in the 
euro area were the main reason for the overall 
increase. Sales in non- euro area countries were 
slightly down on the average of the previous 
quarter. Nominal exports of goods in January 
2020 remained unchanged on the month in 
seasonally adjusted terms. They were percep -
tibly down on the previous quarter in nominal 
and real terms (-½% in each case); in line with 
industrial sales, the decline was attributable to 
weak exports to non- euro area countries. Nom -
inal imports of goods in January 2020 showed 
a slight increase on the December figure 
(+½%). Imports were unchanged  compared 
with the fourth quarter of the previous year, 
although  there was a slight rise (+¼%) after 
adjust ment for price effects .
Construction
Construction output in January 2020 showed a 
very strong seasonally adjusted increase 
(+4¾%) on the figure for the previous month, 
which had undergone a considerable upward 
revision. Construction output was also consid -
erably up on its level in the preceding quarter 
(+3½%), which was chiefly due to an extremely 
sharp increase in activity in the main construc -
tion sector. Output in the finishing trades was 
likewise up strongly, however. The recent 
warmer- than- average weather is likely to have 
played a part in this buoyant construction activ -
ity, but new orders received by the main con -
struction sector in the final quarter of 2019 Significant

–  data are available up to this point  – also 
showed a very strong quarter- on- quarter in -
crease in seasonally adjusted terms. According 
to the Ifo Institute, the reach of orders in the 
main construction industry also increased 
somewhat latterly from an already high level.
Labour market
Developments in the labour market were mut -
edly positive early in the year. As in the two 
preceding months, employment in January 
2020 showed a moderate rise. In seasonally ad -
justed terms, there were 18,000 more persons 
in employment than in December, although the 
year- on- year figure continued to decline. Com -
pared with the January 2019 level, there was a 
241,000, or 0.5%, rise in the total number of 
employees. According to the initial estimate of 
the Federal Employment Agency, December 
saw a strong increase in employment subject 
to social security contributions. This growth 
was mainly attributable to large parts of ser -
vices and to construction. In manufacturing, 
there was a slight fall in employment subject to 
social security contributions, and the decline in 
temporary employment was quite marked in 
fact. Other forms of employment, such as ex -
clusively low- paid part- time employment and 
self- employment, have been exhibiting a nega -
tive trend for some time now and this persisted 
throughout the reporting period. The number 
of employees in cyclical short- time work was 
continuing to rise up to the end of 2019, with 
90,000 persons being affected in December. 
As the leading indicators for the labour market 
were largely calculated before the recent escal -
ation of the coronavirus pandemic at the end 
of February, their informative value is limited 
and uncertainty about the evolving situation is 
especially high.
The number of persons officially registered as 
unemployed fell slightly at the start of the year. 
Following a seasonally adjusted decline of 
4,000 in January, the official unemployment 
figure showed a further fall of 10,000 in Febru -ary. This meant that there were 2.26 million 
persons registered as unemployed with the 
Federal Employment Agency; the unemploy -
ment rate remained at 5.0%. There was no 
change in the unemployment rate compared 
with February 2019 either. The virtually con -
tinuous mild winter weather is likely to have 
played a substantial part in the decline in the 
first two months of 2020. The impact of allevi -
ating labour market policy measures has re -
mained neutral so far.
Prices
Owing to concerns about demand from China, 
oil prices showed a marked fall in February 
2020. They were down by roughly 14% both 
on the month and on the year. In the first half 
of March, the decline in prices accelerated 
against the backdrop of the further spread of 
the new strain of coronavirus. As this report 
went to press, the price of a barrel of Brent 
crude oil was only US$26. Crude oil futures 
were trading at significant premiums. The pre -
mium on crude oil futures was US$6½ for de -
liveries six months ahead and US$9¾ for deliv -
eries 12 months ahead.
Import prices were down markedly in January. 
This was due mainly to lower energy prices, 
while prices of other goods were unchanged 
on average. In industrial domestic sales, for 
which data up to February are already avail -
able, prices also declined because of energy. 
Excluding energy, prices came to a standstill. 
Towards the end of the period under review, 
imports were 0.9% lower and industrial prod -
ucts 0.1% lower than their levels last year.
Consumer prices (HICP) in February continued 
to rise in seasonally adjusted terms. Energy be -
came perceptibly cheaper as crude oil prices 
fell, but there was a further steep rise in food 
prices at the same time. In January, prices of 
services were likewise significantly higher than 
in the previous month owing to a counter -
movement to the sharp decline in the case of Employment

increase  in the prices of industrial goods ex -
cluding energy. Overall, the annual HICP rate 
went up slightly from 1.6% to 1.7%.1 Excluding 
energy  and food, the figure was 1.4%, up from 
1.3%. If crude oil prices remain at the low levels 
reached recently, there is likely to be a sharp 
decline in the overall rate over the next few 
months.
Public finances2
Statutory health insurance 
scheme
According to preliminary data, the statutory 
health insurance scheme –  comprising the 
health insurance institutions and the health 
fund – finished 2019 with a deficit of €1 bil -
lion.3 The result was down €3½ billion on the 
year, almost entirely owing to the health insur -
ance institutions, which recorded a deficit of €1½ billion (following a surplus of €2 billion in 
2018). The reduction in the supplementary 
contribution rates by an average of 0.1  per -
centage point had an impact of just over €1 
billion. The institutions’ financial reserves con -
sequently fell to almost €20 billion. Across all 
health insurance institutions, financial reserves 
were still just at the statutory upper limit of a 
month’s average expenditure. For 2019, the 
health insurance fund recorded a surplus of €½ 
billion, unchanged on the year. Its reserves 
thereby rose to €10 billion.

Health insurance institutions’ revenue (for the 
most part, transfers from the health fund) grew 
by more than 3½%. The slightly lower supple -
mentary contribution rates had a dampening 
effect. At just over 5%, expenditure rose 
sharply, with spending on benefits recording 
slightly stronger growth still (+5½%) given a 
½% increase in the number of insured persons. 
The large expenditure items hospital treatment 
and outpatient treatments rose by roughly 4% 
each. Spending on pharmaceuticals grew by 
5½%. Expenditure on sick pay (+10%) and 
therapeutic treatment and aids (+10½%) ex -
panded particularly sharply. Administration 
costs, meanwhile, fell by 2%. This was largely attributable to lower transfers to provisions for 
pensions, which had, in some cases, been 
raised considerably in previous years given the 
very good financial situation. Adjusted for this 
factor, they would have gone up by 3%.
All in all, the health insurance institutions’ result  
was perceptibly worse than had been expected. 
Total spending was almost 1% higher than the 
figures projected by the group of statutory 
health insurance estimators in the autumn of 
2018. Meanwhile, relief was afforded by the 
fact that the supplementary contribution rates 
did not fall to the rate deemed necessary back 
then to cover expenditure, namely 0.9%.
The health fund’s revenue grew by 3½%, with 
employees’ contributions rising by the same 
amount. Revenue from contributions on pen -
sions rose slightly more strongly (+4½%), partly 
as a result of the expansion of mothers’ pen -
sions. The slightly lower supplementary contri -
bution rates, the lower minimum contributions 
for the self- employed and lower contributions 
for those on low incomes had a dampening ef -
fect. The central government grant was un -
changed. On the expenditure side, transfers to 
the health insurance institutions rose by 3½%. 
This was the level set by the group of estima -
tors back in the autumn of 2018. Overall, the 
health fund exceeded expectations with a small 
surplus, which was almost unchanged on the 
year, though. This was mainly attributable to 
stronger than previously anticipated growth in 
the labour market.
In the autumn of 2019, the group of estimators 
said they expected the health fund to record a 
deficit of just under €1 billion this year. This 
was mainly the result of transfers to the innov -
ation and structural funds. After the estima -
tions were concluded, the decision was taken 
to lower contributions for occupational pen -
sions to the tune of just over €1 billion. The 
revenue shortfall is being compensated from 
the reserves. It was clear, even at the beginning 
of the year, that the health insurance institu -
tions, too, would record a deficit. The result for Sharp rise in

2019 fell short of the assumptions that the 
group of estimators made in the autumn of 
2019. Similarly, at the beginning of 2020, the 
supplementary contribution rates were not 
lifted to the level calculated as being necessary 
to cover expenditure. The unexpected Corona 
pandemic will now hit the health insurance sys -
tem both on the revenue and the expenditure 
front. A shortfall in contributions is likely, 
though this will be cushioned by short- time 
working benefits. While government author -
ities are likely to shoulder some of the cost of 
combatting the pandemic, the cost of treat -
ment is likely to have a large impact on the 
health insurance scheme. This is, however, 
likely to be counteracted temporarily by non-  
essential treatments being postponed under 
the present circumstances. Overall, a larger def -
icit is expected for both statutory health insur -
ance institutions and the health insurance fund. 
Both have very large reserves, however, and are 
consequently well equipped for the expenses 
they face as a result of the crisis.
Public long- term care 
insurance  scheme
The public long- term care insurance scheme 
reported  a sharply improved result in the core 
area in 2019 with a surplus of almost €3½ bil -
lion,4 following a deficit of €3½ billion a year 
earlier.5 The improvement was due to a sharp 
rise in the contribution rate at the beginning of 
2019. The contribution rate rose by 0.5  per -
centage point to 3.05% (plus an extra 0.25 per -
centage point for childless persons), resulting in 
additional revenue of €7½ billion.
Revenue grew sharply, by 24½%, as a result of 
the higher contribution rate. Adjusted for the 
higher contribution rates, growth was still per -
ceptible at 4%. This reflects, first and foremost, 
the positive developments in the labour mar -
ket, with significantly higher wages and salar -
ies. Revenue was, moreover, perceptibly higher, 
as the Care Staff Strengthening Act meant that 
health insurance institutions made payments of €½ billion to the long- term care insurance in -
stitutions. Overall, expenditure grew by a hefty 
6½%. In terms of spending on benefits, there 
was an especially marked increase in cash 
benefits, which were up 9½%. This is largely 
the result of higher care allowance payments 
and higher pension contributions for those 
providing care for a relative. Non- cash benefits,

benefits in kind (including for home medical

also expanded considerably (+11½%).
Overall, the general reserves rose to €7 billion

had cumulative reserves of more than €6½ bil -

Securities markets
Bond market
At €154.9 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in January 2020 was again sig-
nificantly up on the previous month’s figure 
(€67.4 billion). After taking account of in -
creased redemp tions and changes in issuers’ 
holdings of their own debt securities, the out -
standing volume of domestic bonds rose by 
€29.9 billion, following a drop of €24.3 billion 
in December 2019. The outstanding volume of 
foreign debt securities in the German market 
grew by €9.2 billion, which meant that the out -
standing volume of domestic and foreign debt 
securities in Germany in January increased by 
€39.2 billion on balance.
The public sector issued bonds worth €15.6 bil -
lion net in the reporting month. In particular, 
central government increased its capital market 
debt by €11.3 billion on balance. It primarily 
issued  Treasury discount paper (Bubills: €7.9 bil -
lion) and two- year Federal Treasury notes 
(Schätze: €6.0 billion), but also five- year Federal 
notes (Bobls) on a smaller scale (€3.7 billion). 
This contrasted with net redemptions of ten-  
year Federal bonds (Bunds) totalling €9.1 bil -
lion. The Federal states and local governments 
issued bonds to the tune of €4.3 billion on bal -
ance.
Domestic enterprises expanded their capital 
market debt by €9.2 billion in January 2020, following net redemptions of €3.8 billion in 
December 2019. The bulk of this net issuance 
was attributable to non- financial corporations.
Domestic credit institutions issued bonds total -
ling €5.1 billion net in January, following net 
redemptions of €4.3 billion in the previous 
month. This was mainly attributable to other 
bank debt securities that can be structured flex -
ibly (€4.7 billion) and mortgage Pfandbriefe 
(€3.4 billion). This contrasted with debt secur -
ities issued by specialised credit institutions, 
which were redeemed for €3.0 billion net.
Foreign investors were the main purchasers in 
January, adding domestic debt securities with a 
net value of €32.5 billion to their portfolios. 
Domestic credit institutions also purchased 
bonds for €3.4 billion net, the vast majority of 
which were foreign securities. The Bundesbank 
acquired debt securities amounting to €3.0 bil -
lion net – also via the Eurosystem’s asset pur -
chase programmes, which were renewed in 
November 2019. Domestic non- banks topped 
up their bond portfolios to the tune of €0.3 
billion net with solely foreign bonds.
Equity market
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
raised fresh funds of €0.8 billion on balance 
from placing new shares in the German equity 
market. Net issuance of foreign equities in Ger -
many totalled €5.6 billion in the same period. 
Domestic non- banks were the main buyers, 
purchasing equities worth €6.1 billion on bal -
ance. Non-  resident investors acquired German 
shares totalling €0.5 billion net. By contrast, 
domestic credit institutions scaled back their 
equity holdings by €0.3 billion on balance.

beneficiaries (€11.4 billion). Of the various asset 
classes, mixed securities-  based funds (€7.8 bil -
lion) and open- end real estate funds (€3.6 bil -
lion) attracted the most investment. Foreign 
mutual funds placed shares worth €9.4 billion 
in the German market in January. On balance, 
domestic non- banks were virtually the only 
purchasers of mutual fund shares in the report -
ing month (€20.8 billion). Domestic credit insti -
tutions purchased mutual fund shares for €3.0 
billion net, while non- resident investors sold 
domestic fund shares worth €0.1 billion net.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur -
plus of €16.6 billion in January 2020. The result 
was €8.1 billion down on the previous month’s 
level. Although the goods account surplus ex -
panded, the surplus in invisible current transac -
tions – comprising the services account as well 
as primary and secondary income – contracted 
to an even greater extent.
In the reporting month, the surplus in the 
goods account increased by €1.4 billion on the 
month to €14.2 billion. The growth of goods 
imports in foreign trade exceeded that of 
goods exports. In addition, net sales under 
merchanting fell. On the other hand, however, 
exports saw a significant decline in deductions 
made from foreign trade. In particular, exports 
in connection with contract processing fell.
In January, the surplus on invisible current 
transactions fell by €9.5 billion to €2.4 billion. 
This decline was due to lower results in all three 
sub- accounts. Net receipts on primary income 
were down by €4.1 billion to €9.9 billion. This 
was due, in particular, to the normalisation of 
other income following payment of the bulk of 
the agricultural subsidies out of the EU budget 
in December – as is standard practice at year-  
end. The deficit in the secondary income ac -
count widened by €2.9 billion to stand at €7.1 
billion. This was due chiefly to the rise in gen -
eral government payments to the EU budget, which were connected to financing related to 
gross national income and which considerably 
outweighed the decline in expenditure on cur -
rent transfers relating to international cooper -
ation. In addition, a decline was seen in rev -
enue, in particular from current taxes on in -
come and wealth from non- residents accruing 
to general government. Services posted a def -
icit of €0.4 billion in January after recording a 
surplus of €2.2 billion in December. In this con -
text, expenditure fell particularly owing to 
lower expenditure on other business services 
and IT services. Income dropped even more 
sharply, however, especially since receipts from 
charges for the use of intellectual property 
were also down.
In January 2020, sentiment in the financial mar -
kets was marked by heightened uncertainty, 
caused in part by the temporary escalation of 
the dispute between the United States and Iran 
and – starting in the second half of the month –

China. Germany’s cross- border portfolio invest -
ment generated net capital imports of €9.4 bil -
lion (December 2019: net capital exports of 
€35.8 billion). Foreign investors acquired Ger -
man securities worth €32.9 billion net. Safe in -
vestments such as money market paper (€18.2 
billion) and bonds (€14.3 billion) played an im -
portant role here. In addition, foreign investors 
acquired small quantities of shares (€0.5 billion) 
and disposed of investment fund shares (€0.1 
billion). On balance, domestic investors added 
€23.5 billion worth of securities issued by non- 
residents to their portfolios. They acquired, in a 
broadly diversified manner, mutual fund shares 
(€9.4 billion), bonds (€6.4 billion), shares (€4.8 
billion) and money market paper (€2.8 billion).
Direct investment generated net capital exports 
of €1.1 billion in January (following €5.7 billion 
in December 2019). Domestic enterprises in -
creased their foreign direct investment by €3.6 
billion. This was accomplished primarily by 
boosting equity capital (€8.2 billion), chiefly 
through reinvested earnings. By contrast, cross- 
border intra- group lending –  especially trade 
credits – saw €4.7 billion in repayments; in this 
context, it was particularly foreign affiliates 
paying back loans received from their German 
parent companies. Foreign enterprises, on bal -
ance, likewise stepped up their direct invest -
ment in Germany (€2.4 billion). They increased 
the amount of equity capital provided to affili -
ated enterprises (€2.8 billion), also largely 
through reinvested earnings. Intra- group lend -
ing, however, saw net outflows of funds from 
Germany (€0.4 billion).
Other statistically recorded investment – which 
comprises loans and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank de -
posits and other investments – registered net 
capital imports of €6.9 billion in January (fol -
lowing €14.1 billion in December 2019). This 
was due mainly to a reduction in the net claims 
of monetary financial institutions (excluding the 
Bundesbank) on non- residents, which de -
creased to €28.3 billion. By contrast, the Bun -

German balance of payments in 2019
In 2019, the German economy’s current account surplus decreased by ¼ percentage point to 
7¼% of nominal gross domestic product (GDP). As in previous years, this was caused by a drop 
in the goods trade surplus. Very sluggish global trade growth and composition effects left a 
visible  dent in Germany’s exports, whereas imports of goods saw relatively steep growth in spite 
of the industrial downturn. Meanwhile, cheaper import prices, particularly for crude oil, made a 
positive contribution to the foreign trade balance. Moreover, the increase in the primary income 
surplus – attributable to Germany’s higher net external assets – boosted the surplus. Aggregate 
net lending/ net borrowing relative to GDP fell marginally in the reporting year. Both net invest -
ment and savings of non- financial corporations declined amidst the ongoing bout of weakness in 
exports and industry. Housing and government investment expanded substantially, however.
Germany’s capital flows reflected longer- term structural influences, such as growing asset diver -
sification and ongoing globalisation in the corporate sector, as well as changing political risks 
and monetary policy measures. At €204½ billion, net capital exports were below the previous 
year’s level. Portfolio investment as well as direct investment and other investment recorded out -
flows, on balance.
The composition of the capital flows changed distinctly in some cases. For example, for the first 
time since 2014, foreign investors again made net purchases of German securities. In the inter -
vening years, during which the Eurosystem had made large- scale net purchases of bonds, sales 
and redemptions had always predominated. In the other investment category, Germany’s 
TARGET2 claims on the European Central Bank (ECB) declined perceptibly over the course of the 
year. This, too, constituted a reversal in the trend of the preceding years. Germany’s outward 
direct  investment flows were below the previous year’s level, as were inward foreign direct invest -
ment flows. Even so, German foreign direct investment was still marginally higher than the aver -
age of the past ten years and proved relatively robust in the face of turbulent conditions in the 
global economy.Deutsche Bundesbank

Current account
Underlying trends in the 
current  account
Germany’s current account surplus went down 
by €2 billion to €245½ billion in 2019. Relative 
to nominal GDP , the balance declined by ¼ per -
centage point to 7¼%. As a result, the ratio is 
now significantly lower than its peak of 8½% 
of GDP in 2015, after having already decreased 
in the three preceding years.1 As things stand, 
it seems improbable that the German current 
account balance will rise again in the coming 
years.2 Even so, it is likely that the threshold of a three- year moving average of 6% of GDP set 
by the European Commission as part of the 
procedure for preventing and correcting macro -
economic imbalances will continue to be sur -
passed for the time being.3
The slight decline in the current account bal -
ance was due to partially countervailing move -
ments in the sub- accounts. The surplus in the 
goods account decreased significantly in the 
reporting year. This reflects both a smaller for -
eign trade surplus and a greater deficit in sup -
plementary trade items. Volume effects result -
ing from weak export growth and compara -
tively robust domestic demand reduced the 
surplus in the year under review. This was 
counteracted by price effects owing to the 
marked improvement in the terms of trade 
brought about by the lower crude oil price. In 
addition, the deficit in the services account rose 
marginally. As in previous years, the increase in 
the primary income surplus had a surplus-  
boosting effect. Here, the increase in Germa -
ny’s net external assets more than compen -
sated for the dampening effects of the less 
favour  able yield differential and the further 
drop in the yield level. The traditional deficit in 
the secondary income account declined slightly.
Owing to the slowdown in the global econ -
omy, German enterprises faced less favourable 
global economic conditions on the demand 
side in 2019. The pace of world trade stem -
ming from both advanced and emerging mar -
ket economies was very muted. By contrast, 
the slight depreciation of the euro is likely to 
have boosted German export revenue. Its nom -
inal effective exchange rate against the curren -
cies of the euro area’s 38 most important trad -
ing partners, on average across 2019, was 
roughly 1% lower than the previous year’s Current account

German net exports from the perspective 
of the federal states
Current account surpluses have been a dis-
tinguishing feature of Germany’s economy 
since the 1950s. What is striking is the cur-
rent account defi  cit which persisted for 
some time in the 1990s following German 
reunifi  cation. It was followed by current ac-
count surpluses which were very large and 
persistent, even by historical standards.1 
Below, we analyse how the individual fed-
eral states contributed to the dynamics of 
German net exports. This can provide in-
sights into the extent to which their trend 
increase in the period from 1995 to 2016 
can be linked to reunifi  cation and the ex-
tent to which this increase therefore repre-
sents an exception in historical terms.
Regional accounts data at federal state level 
can be used to analyse regional contribu-
tions to German net exports. In conceptual 
terms, a distinction is drawn between net 
exports and the current account balance.2 
Nevertheless, net exports are likely to pro-
vide meaningful information on the devel-
opment of Germany’s current account 
given that they were responsible, in arith-
metical terms, for the majority of the cur-
rent account balance’s dynamics following reunifi  cation. Net exports broken down ac-
cording to federal states can be determined 
approximately as the difference between 
gross domestic product (GDP) and private 
and public consumption as well as gross 
fi  xed capital formation.3
While the net exports of the German Demo-
cratic Republic were largely low,4 the east-
ern federal states experienced negative net 
exports following reunifi  cation, reaching 
their highest level in 1994 at 6.1% of total 
German GDP . The slump in German net ex-
ports following reunifi  cation was therefore 
mainly attributable to developments in the 
eastern federal states, while the positive net 
exports in the western federal states re-
mained largely unchanged during this 
period. Following the reunifi  cation boom, 
the negative net exports in the eastern fed-
1 Aside from that, there were only isolated current ac-
count defi  cits during the economic downturns of the 
late 1960s and early 1980s.
2 The current account balance equals the sum of net 
exports and the primary and secondary income bal-
ance.
3 In addition, in the national accounts equation for net 
exports, changes in inventories, acquisitions less dis-
posals of valuables and statistical discrepancies are fac-
tored out, though no data broken down according to 
federal states are available for this. The net exports of 
a federal state calculated in this way are, however, not 
necessarily identical to their cross- border foreign trade 
balance, since they also include intra- German pur-
chases and sales of goods and services. Even so, the 
sum of the net exports of all federal states corresponds 
to the German net exports since the intra- German bal-
ances add up to zero.

eral states receded, at fi  rst signifi  cantly, and 
later with reduced speed. Although the net 
exports in the western federal states also 
tended to rise in the period following reuni-
fi  cation until 2016, depending on the refer-
ence year, between roughly one- half and 
two- thirds of the growth in Germany’s net 
exports was accounted for by the eastern 
federal states from the 1990s on.5 Viewed 
from this perspective, the sharp increase in 
Germany’s current account balance since 
the late 1990s frequently discussed in the 
literature is likely to be attributable in large 
part to adjustment processes in the eastern 
federal states.
In 2016 – the most recent regional accounts 
data at federal state level in the degree of 
detail required for the analysis – Germany 
generated a net export surplus of 7.4% of 
GDP . In purely arithmetical terms, this was 
distributed very unevenly across the Ger-
man federal states. Overall, there were con-siderable differences particularly in the con-
tributions to German net exports made by 
the eastern and western federal states. The 
western federal states tended to exhibit a 
surplus position, while the eastern federal 
states (excluding Berlin) still generated a 
marginal defi  cit despite the steep decline in 
large defi  cits following the reunifi  cation 
boom described above.6 Overall, the west-
ern federal states generated a surplus of 
8.8% of total German GDP in 2016. By con-
trast, the eastern federal states exhibited a 
defi  cit of 1.4% of GDP .7
In addition to the descriptive evaluations, 
decomposition analyses can provide indica-
tions of which factors have contributed to 
the changes in the net exports of the west-
ern and eastern federal states.8 In purely 
arithmetical terms, a decline in investments 
relative to GDP in the eastern federal states 
as well as a fall in private consumption rela-
tive to GDP in the western federal states 
were the key factors behind the increase in 
5 A role is likely to have been played initially by adjust-
ment processes following the reunifi  cation boom, but, 
at the same time, also by causes similar to those in the 
western federal states. The persistent differences in net 
exports between the western and eastern federal 
states could, for example, be related to location deci-
sions taken by enterprises based on economic and his-
torical factors.
6 In purely arithmetical terms, the largest contributions 
to Germany’s surplus (in each case in percentage 
points) came from North Rhine- Westphalia (2.0), 
Bavaria  (2.0), Baden- Württemberg (1.8) and Hesse 
(1.5). Conversely, the contributions of Brandenburg 
(-0.4), Saxony (-0.3), Schleswig- Holstein (-0.3) and 
Mecklenburg- Vorpommern (-0.3) were the most 
dampening, in arithmetical terms.
7 The current account defi  cit (current account  surplus) 
of the eastern (western) federal states is, however, 
likely to have been signifi  cantly larger than is sug-
gested by the analysis of the net exports on account of 
transfer payments to the eastern federal states. See 
also Blum et al. (2009).
8 In this analysis, changes in the net exports were 
decom posed into contributions from private consump-
tion, public consumption and gross fi  xed capital 
forma tion. Furthermore, gross fi  xed capital formation 
was subdivided into investments in new buildings, new 
machinery and equipment, and existing plants, and 
private consumption was subdivided into disposable 
income, changes in pension entitlements and house-
hold saving.Net exports

German net exports in the period from 
1995 onwards.9 The main reason for the 
weak contribution of investments to the 
increase  in German net exports was the 
reduced  new construction activity following 
the high level in the early 1990s.10 Mean-
while, the contribution made by declining 
private consumption in the western federal 
states (as a percentage of GDP) played a 
key role in the increase in German net ex-
ports roughly from the upturn of 2006-07 
onwards. The weak increase in private con-
sumption in this period in comparison to 
GDP growth is largely attributable to the fall 
in disposable income relative to GDP .
To sum up, more than half of the increase 
in German net exports since 1995 is attrib-
utable to the reduction in the negative net 
exports of the eastern federal states which 
arose following reunifi  cation. All the same, 
Germany’s high net exports in 2016, too, 
were still primarily attributable to the strong 
net exports of the western federal states. 
The results of the analysis suggest that the 
dynamics of Germany’s current account 
since the late 1990s cannot be viewed in 
isolation from the economic adjustment 
processes in the wake of reunifi  cation.9 1995 serves as the reference year for this analysis 
since, at that point in time, the economic turmoil 
result ing directly from reunifi  cation had largely sub-
sided.

level. The euro depreciated against the Japan -
ese yen and US dollar in particular, but also 
against the Swiss franc. Germany’s price com -
petitiveness improved slightly as a result of this. 
Cheaper import prices, especially for crude oil, 
also provided tailwinds for economic activity in 
Germany. A barrel of Brent crude oil cost an 
average of US$64 in 2019 – roughly one- tenth 
less than in the previous year.
Aside from generally weak global demand, 
composition effects also put a strain on Ger -
many’s export revenue. On the one hand, 
domestic  enterprises were particularly affected 
by the global slowdown in industrial output 
and investment given that capital goods (ex -
cluding motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts) 
and intermediate goods make up a large share 
of Germany’s exports. On the other hand, the 
decline in global car sales left a dent in the 
automotive sector’s exports, which are an im -
portant component of Germany’s exports. In 
net terms, exports of goods expanded only marginally. Imports benefited from domestic 
demand, which remained upbeat, even though 
growth in the volume of imports lagged behind 
that of previous years, partly because of the 
downturn in Germany’s industrial sector. The 
lower import prices – and slightly more expen -
sive goods exports – meant that import growth 
outstripped export growth to a lesser degree in 
nominal terms than in real terms. On balance, 
the foreign trade surplus fell by €5 billion to 
€223½ billion in 2019, with volume effects   
(-0.6% of GDP) more than compensating for 
the price effects (0.5% of GDP) resulting from 
the more favourable terms of trade.
In regional terms, the current account surplus 
vis- à- vis both euro area countries and non- euro 
area countries saw a marginal decline to 2¼% 
and just under 5% of GDP , respectively. In both 
cases, developments in goods trade were of 
crucial importance.
Aggregate net lending/ net borrowing relative 
to GDP fell marginally in the reporting year. 
This occurred against a background of de -
creases in domestic investment as well as in 
national  savings. The growth rate of business 
investment contracted markedly amidst the 
ongoing  weakness in exports and the industrial 
sector. In contrast to this, there was a relatively 
large increase in housing investment, in par -
ticular, but also in government investment. Sav -
ing by non- financial corporations, which had 
risen steeply up until 2015, dipped further in 
the reporting year, partly because enterprises’ 
payout ratio increased again.4 Enterprises now 
have a comparatively sound equity base, but 
also a less favourable profit situation amidst 
robust  wage growth, and both factors may 
have played a role here.5 Saving by general 
government was also on the decline given the 
loosened fiscal policy. On balance, net lending 
by non- financial corporations rose significantly, 
while general government net lending declined 
considerably. Meanwhile, net lending by house -Weak global

Goods flows and balance of 
trade
The increase in Germany’s foreign trade activ -
ities experienced another slowdown in 2019. 
On an annual average, exports of goods rose 
by just ¼% in price- adjusted terms.6 On aver -
age in 2019, imports of goods expanded much 
more strongly than exports, at 2¼%, but also 
lost momentum. Foreign manufacturers felt the 
result of Germany’s industrial downturn in the 
shape of very muted growth in demand for 
machinery and equipment, which has a rela -
tively high import content, as well as for inter -
mediate goods. This was only partially offset by 
brisker consumer spending and stronger de -
mand for motor vehicles and motor vehicle 
parts.
In regional terms, export business with the 
most important sales regions predominantly 
developed less favourably than in the previous 
year. Price- adjusted exports to euro area coun -
tries grew only a little overall. In terms of value, 
they merely reached the previous year’s level. 
While revenue from deliveries to Belgium, Por -
tugal and Greece rose strongly, exports to most 
partner countries, including to France (exclud -
ing other transport equipment7), lost momen -
tum or weakened. Declining deliveries to Ire -
land and Italy had a significant dampening 
effect .
Exports to countries outside the euro area like -
wise saw only a marginal increase in price-  
adjusted terms. In nominal terms, however, 
there was distinct growth in export revenue, as 
higher export prices were charged overall. For 
example, a robust increase was recorded in ex -
ports to the United States – probably also given 
an additional boost by the depreciation of the 
euro – as well as to Switzerland and to Russia. 
Although exports to China expanded at an 
above average rate, they lost a significant amount of momentum as growth in China 
gradually slowed and the realignment of its 
economy continued.8 Sales to Japan likewise 
rose at a slower pace than in the previous year.

in exports to other south and east Asian coun -Exports very

tries, particularly to the newly industrialised 
economies. The value of exports to the United 
Kingdom declined sharply on an annual aver -
age, with a role played by the UK’s drop in in -
dustrial production and sluggish demand for 
machinery and equipment in view of Brexit as 
well as composition effects. Additionally, there 
was a significant drop in exports to OPEC coun -
tries. Revenue growth for exports to central 
and eastern European countries belonging to 
the EU but not the euro area was also distinctly 
down on the previous year.
Sluggish global industrial activity and the very 
subdued growth in world trade were felt mainly 
by German exporters of capital and intermedi -
ate goods. In price- adjusted terms, there was 
an especially steep reduction in exports of 
motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts, which 
suffered from the globally overall weaker de -
mand for motor vehicles. As a result, exports of 
motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts to im -
portant sales markets such as the euro area, 
the other central and eastern European EU 
countries, the United Kingdom and the United 
States declined markedly in terms of value. 
After very strong growth previously, sales to 
China provided a much smaller positive stimu -
lus. Subdued deliveries of other categories of 
goods were also a distinct dampener. Price-  
adjusted exports of classic capital goods such 
as machinery remained slightly below the previ -
ous year’s level. Deliveries of metals and fabri -
cated metal products, taken together, rose only 
marginally. Exports of electrical equipment, 
which had hitherto been expanding, experi -
enced weakened momentum in the reporting 
year. By contrast, exports of chemical products 
distinctly picked up pace after very muted de -
velopments. Deliveries of computers, electronic 
and optical products continued to increase 
relatively strongly. The upward trend in con -
sumer goods exports remained relatively robust Exports of

and even strengthened when disregarding 
pharmaceutical exports.9
The growth in demand from Germany did not 
cover the entire range of foreign products. 
Demand  from German consumers remained 
robust , benefiting foreign manufacturers of 
consumer goods, which increased their deliver -
ies more strongly than in 2018 in price- adjusted 
terms. In addition, imports of motor vehicles 
and motor vehicle parts picked up speed. This 
might also have been because stricter CO 2 
emissions standards for newly registered motor 
vehicles apply in the EU from 2020. In particu -
lar, purchases of computers, electronic and 
optical  products abroad increased relatively 
strongly. In contrast to this, Germany’s indus -
trial downturn mainly affected foreign manu -
facturers of intermediate goods and classic 
capital goods. The price- adjusted German sales 
of foreign manufacturers of machinery re -
mained slightly below the previous year’s level. 
Imports of metals and fabricated metal prod -
ucts also decreased. Imports of chemical prod -
ucts as well as electrical equipment were rela -
tively good, but distinctly more subdued than 
in 2018.
Throughout the region in 2019, the robust rise 
in import demand benefited producers in the 
euro area to a slightly greater extent in price-  adjusted terms than producers from other 
countries. Among the more significant sup -
pliers from the euro area, the value of imports 
from Italy and Belgium fell sharply, whilst im -
ports from Spain and Austria saw relatively sub -
stantial growth. Among the non- euro area 
countries, deliveries from the United States 
grew very strongly. Imports from the United 
Kingdom likewise increased relatively steeply. 
Growth in deliveries from China and from the 
central and eastern European EU Member 
States outside of the euro area was above aver -
age, although more restrained than in the pre -
vious year. Imports from Japan and, above all, 
from other industrial and emerging market 
economies in South and East Asia showed rela -
tively muted developments. Furthermore, the 
income of major energy suppliers such as 
Russia  and the OPEC countries from sales to 
Germany was in sharp decline, likely also due 
to the drop in prices for energy products.

trade10 – fell by just under €5 billion to €221½ 
billion in 2019. Although the decline was thus 
similar to the one recorded in the balance of 
foreign trade, it was based on partially oppos -
ing movements in the three other items. In par -
ticular, net receipts from merchanting rose by 
€4 billion. In this context, a major role was 
played by the increased (net) earnings in the 
automotive industry, which account for a con -
siderable proportion of such transactions. In 
addition, net exports of non- monetary gold 
grew by €3½ billion due to greater exports. 
This was attributable primarily to exports to the 
United Kingdom, Switzerland and Canada, 
which generally account for a large share of 
these exports. However, the increases in these 
two sub- items were more or less cancelled out 
by a higher deficit in the balance of supple -
mentary trade items. A particular contribution 
was made to this by a fairly sharp fall in imports 
for processing in Germany.
Invisible current transactions
From Germany’s perspective, the balance in the 
cross- border exchange of services is tradition -
ally negative and recorded a deficit of €20½ 
billion in 2019. Both services income and ser -
vices expenditure grew at a rate of 4½%, which 
is rather moderate in comparison to previous 
years. Due to the higher level of expenditure, 
the deficit rose slightly on the year by just 
under €1 billion. In the reporting period, at a 
total of €23½ billion, more services were pur -
chased by Germany from non- resident pro -
viders in the euro area than were purchased by 
persons in the euro area from Germany; as a 
result, the deficit vis- à- vis the rest of the euro 
area widened by €1½ billion compared to 
2018. By contrast, there was a rise in the slight 
surplus in the services account vis- à- vis non-  
euro area countries.
The largest net position within services was the 
deficit in the balance of cross- border travel, 
which, at around €45 billion, widened margin -
ally on the year. Growth in income as well as travel expenditure was highly subdued in com -
parison to previous years, which could also be 
related to weaker global economic develop -
ments. In particular, expenditure for business 
travel remained more or less unchanged after 
falling sharply last year. Within travel expend -
iture, which rose slightly, travel destinations 
shifted away from the United Kingdom and 
Croatia and towards euro area countries.
In line with the weak economic activity, the ser -
vices sub- accounts related to goods trade saw 
below- average growth. This held especially 
true for transport expenditure, which followed 
the subdued export trend. As the income from 
transport services for non- residents grew to a 
considerably greater extent, this traditionally 
negative sub- account achieved a surplus of €½ 
billion in 2019 after posting a deficit of €2 bil -
lion in the previous year. A similar situation was 
observed in manufacturing services, which saw 
declines in both income and expenditure. By 
contrast, there was notably strong momentum 
in cross- border maintenance and repair ser -
vices, which nevertheless continued to post a 
balanced account.
Some knowledge-  based services, such as the 
use of intellectual property and communica -
tions and IT services, have already been exhibit -
ing strong growth for some time now in terms 
of both income and expenditure. In the year 
under review, growth on the income side 
slowed while spending continued to increase 
dynamically; as a result, the common surplus of 
both sub-  accounts fell slightly. There was also 
comparatively weak growth in income related 
to other business services, which include re -
search and development, professional, tech -
nical and commercial services, as well as man -
agement consultancy services. As expenditure Rise in net

10 In accordance with the current edition of the Balance of 
Payments and International Investment Position Manual 
(BPM6), trade with non-  monetary gold must be shown 
separately in the current account. If corresponding pay -
ments have already been captured in foreign trade, these 
are recorded as deductions in the supplementary trade 
items in order to avoid duplication. See International Mon -

rose to a greater extent than income here, too, 
the deficit in this sub- account widened. The 
surplus in cross- border fees for financial and in -
surance services grew slightly, which was pri -
marily attributable to increased earnings from 
financial services.
Germany’s primary income from abroad in 
2019 exceeded its corresponding payments to 
the rest of the world by €92½ billion. As in the 
preceding years, cross- border investment in -
come was the major factor in primary income 
growth, while the flows of employee compen -
sation and other primary income each largely 
continued to lead to marginal deficits in the re -
spective sub- accounts. In the reporting year, 
the surplus in cross- border investment income 
saw comparatively moderate growth of €3 bil -
lion and, according to provisional calculations, 
totalled €94½ billion after having risen very 
substantially in some cases in the preceding 
years.11 In this context, residents’ income from 
investments abroad rose only a little; expend -
iture for investors and capital donors from 
abroad was just marginally higher than the 
figures  from the previous year. In arithmetical 
terms, the increase in Germany’s net external 
assets was the main contributor to the higher 
surplus. By contrast, a dampening effect 
stemmed from the fact that the yield level con -
tinued to sink in 2019 and that the yield differ -
ential developed to the detriment of Ger -
many.12
In 2019, the deficit in cross- border secondary 
income amounted to €47½ billion – €1 billion 
less than in 2018. Unilateral payments from 
abroad rose by €3½ billion, with government 
and non- government income rising in roughly 
equal measure. This also included a marked 
increase  in Germany’s tax revenue from non-  
residents’ income and assets. On the expend -
iture side, spending rose by €2½ billion over 
2018, primarily due to government benefits. 
Only a small portion of this rise was attribut -
able to the private sector. Amongst other 
things, there was a slight increase in remit -
tances.Capital movements

non- residents; however, outflows of funds 
dominated in direct investment and other 
invest ment, too. Alongside the fundamental 
economic factors that helped determined the 
current account balance, diminishing political 
risks over the course of the year as well as the 
European monetary policy stance had an im -
pact on German capital movements last year.
After the date for the United Kingdom’s with -
drawal from the European Union had been 
postponed multiple times at the start of the 
year, in the second half of the year there were 
signs of a solution that would avoid a hard pol -
itical and economic split for the time being.13 
Furthermore, in December, the United States 
and China reached a partial agreement in their 
trade dispute, which had been mounting for 
years. Both of these developments contributed 
to the lower risk evaluation on the international 
financial markets over the course of the year.
After four years, the Eurosystem temporarily 
suspended its net purchases under the ex -
panded asset purchase programme (APP) at the 
end of 2018. Up until October last year, only 
maturing bonds were replaced. It was not until 
November 2019 that the national central banks 
and the ECB again began purchasing additional 
securities (€20 billion net per month). In the 
German financial account, this had an impact 
not only on portfolio investment, but also on 
other investment. In the years prior, German 
TARGET2 claims had risen continuously in con -
nection with the net asset purchases.14 When 
this driver was lost at the start of 2019, the bal -
ance initially stabilised and even recorded a de -
cline over the entire year. This development im -
pacted other investment as Bundesbank capital

Portfolio investment
Portfolio investment generated net capital ex -
ports of €95 billion in 2019, following €157 bil -
lion one year earlier. The lower balance is due 
to a massive shift in demand for German secur -
ities among non- resident investors. In net 
terms, non- resident investors added German 
securities totalling €28½ billion to their port -
folios in 2019. In 2018, they had offloaded Ger -
man securities to the amount of €74 billion. 
Although non- resident investors continued to 
sell off public sector bonds, the volume sold 
was – at €7 billion – considerably below the 
figure recorded last year. The temporary sus -
pension of the APP might have been a reason 
for this. As a result, the Bundesbank purchased 
no additional securities from January to Octo -
ber. Another  highly significant factor in this 
shift was the increased demand for private 
bonds – non- resident investors acquired both 
corporate bonds as well as bank bonds. Ultim -
ately, they also added more money market 
paper (€7 billion) to their portfolios in 2019 
than they had in 2018.
In contrast to debt securities, and despite very 
favourable overall stock price performance on 
the German equity market over the year, shares 
in German- domiciled enterprises were sold off 
by non- resident investors in net terms (€6½ bil -
lion). With regard to mutual fund shares, sales 
by non- resident investors resulted in outflows 
of €5 billion in 2019.
Last year, domestic investors acquired a net 
€123½ billion worth of foreign securities. This 
meant that net purchases were considerably 
higher on the year. As in 2018, German invest -
ors focused their attention on bonds (€54½ 
billion ). Amongst other factors, this could be 
attribut able to the yields on long- term Federal 
bonds, which were overwhelmingly negative 
and fell further over the course of the year. For -
eign bonds probably became more attractive to 
investors because, although their yields were 
also falling and they posed additional risks in 
some cases, they promised higher returns. Non- resident

What drives Germany’s TARGET balances?*
A BVAR analysis for distinguishing global and 
European causes
The present analysis aims to identify pos-
sible drivers of Germany’s TARGET balances 
with the aid of a comparatively simple 
Bayesian vector autoregression (BVAR) 
model and place them in a historical con-
text. The balances have shown considerable 
fl  uctuations over the past years. In this 
respect , four phases are typically identifi  ed.1
During the fi  rst phase, the national TARGET 
balances moved at a low level following the 
start of the third stage of economic and 
monetary union and frequently changed 
their signs. The cross- border redistribution 
of liquidity in the euro area took place over-
whelmingly through the private interbank 
market.
The second phase was characterised by a 
strong expansion of the national TARGET 
balances. It began with the outbreak of the 
global fi  nancial crisis, which had its origin in 
the sub- prime mortgage crisis in the United 
States. As private commercial banks were 
becoming increasingly mistrustful of each 
other, the interbank market largely col-
lapsed. The Governing Council of the ECB 
then adopted a series of non- standard 
monetary policy measures in order to con-
tinue supplying commercial banks with cen-
tral bank money. Above and beyond that, 
the ECB and other central banks arranged 
an international network of swap agree-
ments in order to safeguard access to for-
eign exchange as well.2 A further expansion 
of the national TARGET balances ensued in 
spring 2010 and became stronger in the 
follow ing year. This occurred against the 
backdrop of the European sovereign debt 
crisis, which was again accompanied by a 
generous provision of central bank money. The funds on offer were utilised asymmet-
rically by the commercial banks of the 
Member States and were deployed across 
borders in some cases.
In summer 2012, this development resulted 
in a period of easing with falling TARGET 
balances (third phase). The commitment 
made by Mario Draghi, who was President 
of the ECB at the time, “to do whatever it 
takes to preserve the euro” boosted the 
fi  nan cial markets’ confi  dence in the con-
tinued existence of monetary union. Fur-
thermore, the Eurosystem adopted a pro-
gramme of outright monetary transactions 
(OMT), which so far has not been utilised, 
however.
The fourth phase began in mid- 2014 and 
brought with it a renewed rise in the na-
tional TARGET balances. In mid- 2018, Ger-
man claims reached an interim peak of 
almost  €1,000 billion. However, this in-
crease was not linked to a European or 
global fi  nancial crisis. Instead, it refl  ected 
the Eurosystem’s expanded asset purchase 
programme (APP) in conjunction with Ger-
many as a fi  nancial centre in its role as a 
“gateway to the world”.
* TARGET, the real- time gross settlement (RTGS) system 
for the Eurosystem, commenced operations on 4 Janu-
ary 1999, a few days after the launch of the euro. 
Migration  to the more advanced TARGET2 took place 
gradually from 2007 to 2008. The term “TARGET” is 
used here to refer to both the fi  rst and second gener-
ations of the system.
1 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2019a, 2019b, 2017a, 
2016).
2 The participants in the agreement – which is still in 
force – are the ECB, the Fed, the Bank of Canada, the 
Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, and the Swiss 
National  Bank. The provision of foreign currency to 
European commercial banks via the Eurosystem led to 
the ECB having a positive TARGET balance for a time in 
2008 and 2009.Deutsche Bundesbank

The following econometric analysis of Ger-
many’s TARGET balance relates to the 
period from the beginning of 1999 to the 
end of 2019. A BVAR model is used to iden-
tify the outlined driving forces and assign 
them to the various episodes.
The model incorporates monthly data of 
n = 5 variables: change in Germany’s 
TARGET balances compared with the same 
month of the previous year (variable: tar-
gett; in euro), difference in yield between 
bonds of other euro area countries and 
Bunds (variable: EAspreadt; in percentage 
points), difference in yield between ten- year 
US Treasuries and Bunds (variable: 
USspreadt; in percentage points), implied 
volatility on the stock market as an indica-
tor of (global) uncertainty (variable: vixt; in 
index points), and change in the sum of all 
assets on the Eurosystem’s consolidated 
balance sheet concerning monetary policy 
operations compared with the same month 
in the previous year (variable: balancet; in 
euro).3
The data used accordingly cover the period 
from January 1999 to December 2019. 
However, owing to the use of year- on- year 
changes, only data from January 2000 on-
ward are available for the estimation. The 
effective estimation period is further short-
ened by the inclusion of lags.
The BVAR model is estimated with a Minne-
sota prior.4 In total, 12 lags and thus a 
whole year of back data are included. The 
estimated reduced form BVAR model is rep-
resented as
yt=c+12X
i=1Aiyti+✏t
where yt = (y1,t,y2,t,…,yn,t) denotes an 
n × 1 vector of the variables described 
above, c a constant, Ai the n × n coeffi   cient matrices of the observations yt-i lagged by i 
units, and /uni03F5t an n × 1 vector of residuals 
that follows a multivariate normal distribu-
tion (i.e. /uni03F5t ~N(0,/summation.text)). E (/uni03F5t,/uni03F5t/prime) = /summation.text  repre-
sents the positively defined variance- 
covariance matrix of the residuals.
By means of sign restrictions on the impulse- 
response functions, the model is converted 
into a structural form so that the shocks can 
be interpreted in economic terms. These re-
strictions have to be fulfi  lled only in the 
period in which the shock occurs. All the 
shocks are defi  ned such that they lead to an 
increase in the variable targett. The other 
restrictions are selected as shown in the 
table on p. 32.
In line with the assumption, a global risk 
shock results in capital fl  ows to the United 
States and also to Germany. Both countries 
are seen as safe havens. Because of the 
United States’ outstanding role as a safe 
haven, the decline in yields in the United 
States should more than offset the decline 
in Germany, however, leading to a com-
pression of the positive yield spread be-
tween US Treasuries and Bunds during the 
observation period. Based on the same line 
of reasoning, an increase in the yield spread 
between Bunds and bonds of other euro

euro area credit institutions related to monetary policy 
operations denominated in euro) and 7.1 (Securities 
held for monetary policy purposes).
4 Using a Minnesota prior, an existing a priori estima-
tion regarding the model parameters is specifi  ed for 
the model. In this case, the following a priori values 
are used: autoregressive coeffi   cient: 0.8; overall tight-
ness: 0.1; cross- variable weighting: 0.5; lag decay: 2; 
exogenous variable tightness: 100; total number of 
iter ations: 2,000; burn- in iterations: 1,000. The ECB’s 
BEAR toolbox version 4.2 is used for the estimation.Deutsche Bundesbank

area countries is to be expected. The higher 
risk should be refl  ected in a rise in vix.5
The identifi  cation of a shock confi  ned to 
the euro area rests on the assumption that 
an increase in risk in the euro area leads to 
capital fl  ows from other euro area countries 
to Germany. The reason for this is that Ger-
many is seen as a safe haven within the 
euro area. This should lead to higher yields 
in other euro area countries. In Germany, by 
contrast, declining yields are to be ex-
pected, which should be refl  ected in a 
widening of the yield spread between 
Germany  and the other euro area countries. 
As a result of the lower yields in Germany, 
the yield spread between US Treasuries and 
Bunds should also increase. Even though 
the euro area represents only a (small) 
part  of the global economy, it is to be 
expected  that there will be a tendency for 
vix to rise.
The expansionary monetary policy shock is 
understood as an expansion of the sum of 
all the Eurosystem balance sheet items re-
lated to monetary policy operations. It is as-
sumed in this context that these reduce the 
yield spreads between government bonds 
of other euro area countries and Bunds.
These shocks are defi  ned such that, overall, 
no combination of impulse- response func-
tions is excluded and each shock neverthe-
less possesses an individual pattern, i.e. the shocks are orthogonal to each other. The 
residual shocks are identifi  ed for purely 
economic  reasons and cannot therefore 
be  inter preted in economic terms. These 
shocks thus model additional factors that 
do not fall into the above- mentioned cat-
egories.
The BVAR estimation permits the time series 
of all the variables involved to be broken 
down into components, which are to be as-
signed to the shocks defi  ned above.
The rise in German TARGET balances during 
the global fi  nancial crisis, which remained 
moderate at fi  rst, is not explained entirely 
by the economically interpretable shocks. 
Although it is indeed possible to recognise 
that the global increase in risk played a 
part, this is offset by a decline in risk in the 
euro area (i.e. by a convergence of long- 
term interest rates among the Member 
States).
Subsequently, at the peak of the European 
debt crisis between 2010 and mid- 2012, 
the dominant factor affecting German 
5 This shock of rising global risk differs from a possible 
monetary policy impulse from the United States in that 
it has the opposite effect on vix. An accommodative 
monetary policy by the Fed should, taken in isolation, 
lower the risk assessment on the fi  nancial markets. It is 
not explicitly identifi  ed as it is unlikely to have any 
clear- cut and systematic impact on Germany’s TARGET 
balances. Possible effects are captured in the model by 
the two residual shocks.Restrictions assumed to identify various shocks

TARGET fl  ows was the then growing uncer-
tainty in the euro area, although global fac-
tors, too, still played a key role according to 
the model.
The estimation results confi  rm the suspicion 
that the renewed positive TARGET fl  ows be-
tween 2015 and 2017 were chiefl  y attribut-
able to European monetary policy (i.e. the 
APP) and only to a lesser extent to the risk 
assessment within the euro area.
Finally, the results suggest that a large part 
of the recent decline in German TARGET 
claims recorded in 2018 and 2019 can be 
ascribed to European monetary policy. The 
Eurosystem initially made a gradual reduc-
tion in the volume of net asset purchases 
up to the end of 2018 and then discon-
tinued them entirely. It is only since Novem-
ber 2019 that the purchases have again 
exceeded  the volume of expired and re-
deemed securities in the portfolio.All in all, the estimation results of the model 
–  which was intentionally kept relatively 
simple – confi  rm the conjecture that Ger-
many’s TARGET balances have been infl  u-
enced by various drivers over time.TARGET balance of the Bundesbank and the historical breakdown of the changes

While demand focused primarily on euro-  
denominated paper, German residents also in -
vested in foreign currency bonds in 2019. In 
addition, they added foreign money market in -
struments worth €2 billion to their portfolios.
Furthermore, German investors increasingly 
purchased foreign investment fund certificates 
(€53 billion) and shares (€14 billion). Inter -
national stock markets recorded considerable 
gains last year. Despite the higher price risk 
compared to debt securities, this encouraged 
increased exposure to shares and other equity. 
Net acquisition of investment fund certificates 
almost doubled compared to the previous year. 
These originated mainly from Luxembourg and 
Ireland, where many of the companies that sell 
funds in Germany are based. From these loca -
tions, they invest funds on a worldwide basis, 
for which reason no regional classification of 
the actual target countries is possible. Among 
direct share purchases, demand focused on 
shares and other equity in US enterprises.
Financial derivatives, which are aggregated to 
form a single item in the balance of payments, 
recorded net capital exports of €22½ billion in 
2019. The balance therefore remained largely 
unchanged compared to 2018.16 Around three- 
fifths of the recorded capital outflows were 
accounted  for by futures transactions, with op -
tions generating the remaining two- fifths. 
Cross- border forward and futures contracts 
relat ing to electricity and gas, which are also 
recorded under financial derivatives, resulted in 
net capital imports totalling €1 billion. Monet -
ary financial institutions constituted the major -
ity of the domestic counterparties engaging in 
internationally traded financial derivatives.
Direct investment
As things currently stand, global direct invest -
ment flows in 2019 were down slightly on the 
previous year, following significantly steeper 
declines in the two preceding years. Last year, 
too, the global economic environment was in some instances not always conducive to invest -
ment abroad. The dampening factors included 
subdued macroeconomic developments, but 
also political uncertainties. These diminished 
markedly in the second half of the year after 
the United States and China reached a partial 
agreement in their bilateral trade dispute and 
signs of convergence emerged in the UK’s diffi -
cult exit negotiations on leaving the European 
Union. The 2017 tax reform in the United 
States, which led to significantly lower gross 
foreign direct investment flows from the United 
States and worldwide in 2018, continued to 
have a detrimental effect. However, according 
to estimates by the United Nations Conference 
on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), these 
effects weakened in 2019. In addition, accord -
ing to UNCTAD’s still provisional data, in 2019 
there were significantly fewer cross- border cor -
porate mergers and acquisitions than in 2018.
Overall, UNCTAD estimates that global direct 
investment flows in 2019 fell by 1% on the 
year.17 This decline masks divergent develop -
ments in individual countries and regions. For 
example, direct investment flows to the EU fell 
by roughly 15%, while those to North America 
and the group of developing countries re -
mained at the previous year’s level.
Direct investment flows to and from Germany 
also weakened in 2019 compared to 2018. 
However, in 2018 they had been exceptionally 
high, bucking the global trend. Overall, Ger -
man net capital exports from direct investment 
in 2019 came to €55½ billion, exceeding the 
figure for 2018 by €51 billion.
German enterprises invested €101 billion 
abroad in 2019, which was €47 billion lower 
than the all- time high recorded in 2018. In a

16 There have been net outflows of funds for financial 
deriva tives in most years since 2012. Some of these out -

tion with interest rate swaps concluded by domestic credit 
institutions to hedge fixed- income securities against inter -

ment abroad in 2019 was still marginally higher 
than the average of the ten preceding years. 
German enterprises primarily boosted their 
equity capital abroad, which went up by a total 
of €87 billion. This increase was achieved in 
more or less equal measure via equity capital in 
the narrower sense and reinvested earnings. 
German enterprises that ramped up their equity 
capital abroad came from various branches of 
industry. Last year, three quarters of equity cap -
ital, and thus the largest share, came from 
enter prises providing financial and insurance 
services.18 Cross- border corporate takeovers 
played a smaller role last year than in 2018, 
when the value of such takeovers was particu -
larly high.19
German enterprises provided their affiliates 
abroad with a further €14 billion via intra- group 
lending, which took place exclusively in the 
form of financial loans. For trade credits, by 
contrast, repayments outweighed new lending.
Direct investment relationships are usually 
geared to the long term. German enterprises 
use these relationships to pursue various ob -
jectives. This is demonstrated by the annual 
survey by the Association of German Chambers 
of Commerce and Industry (DIHK) of its mem -
ber enterprises operating in the manufacturing 
sector.20 According to this survey, strengthen -
ing distribution structures and customer service 
remained an important reason for outward in -
vestment for a large proportion of enterprises 
(just under 45%). Roughly one- third of enter -
prises hoped to gain better market access by … and to a

19 According to the Thomson Reuters database, in 2019 
roughly €32½ billion was used to finance takeovers of 
companies domiciled abroad and previously under foreign 
ownership where the German stake after the transaction is 
at least 10%. That was just under half the amount in 2018. 
The time at which mergers and acquisitions are captured in 
the balance of payments can, however, differ from that 
recorded by Thomson Reuters, meaning that the reported 
figures are not directly comparable.

producing abroad, and just over one- quarter of 
surveyed enterprises cited cost savings as a mo -
tivating factor in direct investment. The signifi -
cance of cost savings relative to other object -
ives therefore continued to increase somewhat 
last year, according to the survey.
German enterprises invest in many countries 
and regions throughout the world. Tradition -
ally, Europe is an important target region. Last 
year, €54½ billion of German direct investment 
abroad flowed to other European countries, of 
which €49 billion flowed to euro area coun -
tries. Within Europe, investments in Luxem -
bourg, Italy and the Netherlands were com -paratively high. However, the highest amount 
of direct investment to a single country in 2019 
was made in the United States, amounting to 
€34½ billion.
Domestic enterprises received €45 billion from 
abroad in the form of direct investment in 
2019. That was only about one- third of the all- 
time high of €143½ billion recorded in 2018. 
Foreign enterprises provided domestic enter -
prises with €24 billion in intra-  group lending, 
which occurred exclusively through the issu -
ance of financial loans. A large proportion of 
this was made up of reverse flows, whereby 
subsidiaries domiciled abroad provide financial 
loans to their German parent companies. These 
reverse flows are often the result of capital 
market transactions involving German enter -
prises’ financing subsidiaries in which securities 
are issued abroad and the proceeds are passed 
on to their parent companies in Germany.
In 2019, investors in Europe again accounted 
for the largest share of foreign direct invest -
ment in Germany, at €27 billion. Roughly €7½ 
billion of this amount came from other euro 
area countries, with particularly large inflows 
coming from Luxembourg and Ireland. This 
contrasted with considerable return flows of 
funds to Belgium and the Netherlands, which 
were primarily accounted for by repayments of 
intra- group loans. Among European countries 
outside of the euro area, a particularly large 
volume of direct investment came from the 
United Kingdom (€10½ billion). Outside of 
Europe , investors from the United States in -
vested particularly heavily in Germany (€12½ 
billion).
Other investment
Other investment, comprising financial and 
trade credits (where these do not constitute a 
part of direct investment) as well as bank de -
posits and other assets, resulted in net capital 
exports of €32 billion in 2019, down from €52 
billion in 2018.Europe and the

Capital outflows in the banking sector were the 
main driver here. Transactions of monetary 
finan cial institutions excluding the Bundesbank 
led to capital exports of €19½ billion on bal -
ance. There was a contraction in their cross-  
border liabilities, in particular, because foreign 
institutions, and above all group- affiliated insti -
tutions, scaled back their deposits at domestic 
banks. Year- end effects are not unusual for 
these cross- border investments; however, the 
outflows of funds recorded at the end of 2019 
were particularly high.
It is possible that the ECB Governing Council’s 
decision in September 2019 to introduce a 
two- tier system for reserve remuneration also 
played a role here. This arrangement came into 
force at the end of October last year. Since 
then, part of credit institutions’ excess liquidity 
holdings has been exempt from negative remu -
neration at the rate applicable on the deposit 
facility. The new regime led individual commer -
cial banks to reallocate their central bank de -
posits in order to make better use of the avail -
able allowances. To some extent, they are likely 
to have redistributed some of the liquidity 
across borders.
In lending business, domestic credit institutions 
increased their issuance of financial loans to 
enterprises and households abroad, but scaled 
back, albeit to a lesser extent, their deposits at 
group- affiliated institutions abroad. Overall, 
this contributed to the aforementioned capital 
exports.
Bundesbank accounts also recorded net capital 
outflows in 2019, which amounted to €26½ 
billion. Movements in foreign liabilities played a 
decisive role here. The Bundesbank’s liabilities 
vis- à- vis non- residents fell by €97½ billion. 
Monetary authorities and commercial banks 
domiciled outside the euro area significantly 
reduced  their deposits at the Bundesbank on 
the year, after increasing them by €101½ bil -
lion in 2018. The operations of these foreign 
counterparties explain the turnaround in the 
Bundesbank’s liabilities recorded in the balance of payments. At the end of a given year, the 
deposits of non- euro area residents at the 
Bundes bank often temporarily record a signifi -
cant increase. In 2018, this was especially pro -
nounced. There was also an end- of- year effect 
in 2019, but this was much weaker than in the 
preceding year.
In previous years, the APP had additionally led 
to a rise in deposits of foreign commercial 
banks at the Bundesbank.21 The Eurosystem

sumed them in November, at a monthly pace 
of €20 billion.
The temporary suspension of net asset pur -
chases and the aforementioned outflows of 
funds from the banking system also had an im -
pact on the Bundesbank’s TARGET2 claims on 
the ECB. They fell in 2019 by a total of €71 
billion on the year, which was the sharpest fall 
since the beginning of 2013.22 By contrast, the 
Bundesbank’s liabilities vis- à- vis the ECB arising 
from the allocation of euro banknotes within 
the Eurosystem went up by €34½ billion last 
year. The Bundesbank’s net claims vis- à- vis the 
ECB arising from the two balance sheet items 
therefore fell by €105½ billion overall.
In other investment, non-  banks received net 
inflows  of funds from abroad in 2019 (€14 bil -
lion). This was primarily attributable to net cap -
ital imports by enterprises and individuals (€9½ 
billion). The funds they raised abroad in 2019 
stemmed in particular from financial loans. 
Non- securitised foreign transactions by general 
government led to an inflow of funds amount -
ing to €4½ billion net. General government 
claims decreased, while its external liabilities remained   at the same level as in the previous 
year.
Reserve assets
Driven by transactions, the Bundesbank’s re -
serve assets fell by €½ billion in 2019. An 
increase  in the reserve position in the Inter -
national Monetary Fund and in special drawing 
rights contrasted with a decline in other reserve 
assets.
The international reserve holdings are also in -
fluenced by balance sheet adjustments which, 
in compliance with internationally agreed ac -
counting standards, are not recognised in the 
balance of payments. The end- of- year revalu -
ation of the reserve assets resulted in an in -
crease of €26½ billion in 2019. This was due 
chiefly to rising gold prices. All in all, the bal -
ance sheet value of Germany’s reserve assets 
rose by €26 billion in 2019, standing at €199½ 
billion as at 31 December 2019.Significant fall in

Households’ digital purchases in the 
balance  of payments
The purpose of the balance of payments is to measure all economic transactions conducted 
between residents and non- residents over a given period of time, thus presenting an overview of 
the economy’s various external trade links. This also includes cross- border digital trade. Digital 
services obtained by domestic households from foreign providers outside of Germany present 
a particular challenge here. Unlike in the case of enterprises, deliveries received by households 
usually remain far below the existing statistical reporting threshold in terms of value. In cooper -
ation with the Federal Statistical Office, the Bundesbank has therefore developed an estimation 
approach to plug this gap in the balance of payments data. As from the 2014 reporting year, the 
results yielded by this approach are incorporated into the current account from 2019 onwards.
In the first instance, the selected two- step approach involves searching for existing freely avail -
able data sources for Germany’s total turnover. Here, a distinction is made between five market 
segments: video on demand services, audio on demand services, software purchase and use, 
online gambling and cloud services. In a second step, the share of foreign enterprises’ contribu -
tion to total turnover is determined in each case, as only this is relevant for the balance of pay -
ments.
Following this approach, digital purchases by German households from non- resident providers 
totalled around €5.8 billion in 2017. Although this accounts for only 2% of the expenditure on 
services recorded in the balance of payments, it still represents considerable growth – foreign 
digital purchases made by households have almost doubled since 2014. On balance, Germany’s 
current account surplus relative to gross domestic product was 0.2 percentage point lower in 
2017 than if households’ digital purchases had been excluded.
From an international perspective, the German model is one of the first to attempt to capture 
such purchases in the balance of payments. The selected approach makes it possible to plug gaps 
in the official statistical data with freely available information, respond rapidly to new market 
developments, add new market segments at any time and supplement or swap data sources for 
market segments that have already been recorded. On the other hand, using freely available 
internet sources limits the extent to which quality checks can be conducted. It also makes the user 
reliant on publication decisions made by the sources themselves. This could potentially cast the 
provision of data for the official statistics into doubt. Ways of responding to these challenges still 
have to be devised. Cooperation with the data providers is of vital importance here.Deutsche Bundesbank

Background
Digitalisation is also influencing international 
trade to an ever greater extent. As well as redu -
cing barriers to market entry, it enables small 
and medium- sized enterprises, in particular, to 
market their services directly worldwide. From 
a consumer perspective, digitalisation is result -
ing in improved market transparency, which in 
turn is causing a shift in purchasing habits from 
domestic bricks and mortar retailers to online 
retailers domiciled abroad.
Furthermore, new digital services such as on -
line shopping and the use of online software 
have emerged. The online provision of music, 
films and other content is still a relatively new 
market segment, too. These new digital ser -
vices, directly provided by enterprises to final 
consumers, have thus far been insufficiently 
considered in the international trade statistics, 
the macroeconomic accounting systems util -
ised in the national accounts and the balance 
of payments statistics alike.
The reasons for this are essentially twofold. 
First, the value of such transactions is frequently 
below the national statistical reporting thresh -
olds. In Germany, for example, cross- border 
services transactions only have to be reported if 
they exceed €12,500.1 Second, it is not gener -
ally possible for consumers to easily identify 
non- resident providers and their country of 
domicile. Households’ purchases of digital ser -
vices from foreign providers have thus re -
mained virtually unconsidered in the official 
statistics to date. However, as the purpose of 
the balance of payments is to give as complete 
a picture as possible of all transactions between 
resident entities and the rest of the world, this 
data gap must be closed.
There are several possible ways to close data 
gaps. These include the introduction of a new 
comprehensive official data collection method: 
a sample survey or a new evaluation of the 
data already available, for example. The Bun -
desbank, in cooperation with the Federal Stat -istical Office, has opted for the latter approach, 
as accessing existing data sources yields results 
comparatively quickly without imposing new 
reporting obligations on economic agents.
Conceptual framework
The international “Handbook on Measuring 
Digital Trade”,2 a joint publication by the OECD, 
the WTO and the IMF, serves as the basis for 
the estimation approach. First, it describes the 
conceptual framework used to define digital 
trade and its dimensions; second, it provides an 
overview of existing national and international 
approaches to the measurement of such trade. 
As such efforts are still in their infancy world -
wide, there are plans to update the electronic 
version of the Handbook on a regular basis. In 
this way, newly devised or improved methods 
can promptly be made available to a wide circle 
of statisticians and users.
The Handbook defines digital transactions as 
trade in goods and services that are digitally 
ordered, digitally delivered or platform enabled. 
Pursuant to this definition, households’ pur -
chases of digital services from non- resident 
providers, which are the focus of this article, 
represent only a subset of digital trade.
Estimation approach
The estimation approach for households’ digital 
purposes uses freely available market data. In 
the absence of a single data source for all 
digital services, a variety of data sources are 
referred  to, each of which usually covers only 
one particular market segment. Accordingly, 
the estimation approach differentiates between Digitalisation

digital services in five market segments: namely 
video on demand services, audio on demand 
services, software purchase and use, online 
gambling and cloud services.
Digital sales relevant to the balance of pay -
ments are estimated in a two- step process 
which is reliant on data being available for the 
years 2014 to 2017. First, total sales are deter -
mined for the individual market segments. In a 
second step, the share of foreign enterprises’ 
contribution to total turnover is determined in 
each case, as only this is relevant for the bal -
ance of payments.
Several problems emerge in practice. For in -
stance, some of the data sources for individual 
segments overlap, with the result that pay -
ments may be counted twice. Other datasets 
also contain sales which were not generated 
online and which therefore do not count to -
wards digital trade. In such cases, corrections 
must be made accordingly.
Modules of the estimation 
approach 
Video on demand services give users instant 
access to video content of their choice. Users 
generally pay a subscription to access content. Other business models include transaction-  
based video on demand services, where cus -
tomers pay providers to stream video content 
for a limited period or a limited number of 
times. The electronic sell- through model gives 
users the right to permanently access a video in 
exchange for a one- off download fee. The 
sales figures for this market segment are taken 
from a study carried out by the market research 
institution Gesellschaft für Konsumforschung 
(GfK) on behalf of the German Federal Film 
Board (FFA).3 The study puts total sales for 
video on demand services at around €0.8 bil -
lion in 2017. To calculate the foreign share with 
relevance to the balance of payments, we use 
a regional breakdown of video on demand pro -
viders available on the market.4 According to 
this, just over one- third was attributable to 
cross- border transactions in 2017.

other information, the estimate assumes that this share re -

assumption for a market that is still young and dynamic. 
Netflix, for instance, has only been available in Germany 
since September 2014, while other foreign providers have 
disappeared from the market. The share of video on de -

from an internet provider, or to stream audio 
content. The Bundesverband Audiovisuelle 
Medien  (Federal Association for Audiovisual 
Media) puts sales for digital audio content at 
around €0.6 billion in 2016.5 On the basis of 
these data, sales of roughly €0.7 billion are 
projected  for 2017.6 In contrast to the video on 
demand segment, digital audio content is 
mostly provided by non- resident providers. 
About 90% of the sales calculated for 2017 are 
therefore relevant to the balance of payments.
The purchase and use of software can be 
broken down into two sub- categories: mobile 
applications and video games for PCs or other 
games consoles. According to information 
from providers of app market data,7 sales for 
mobile apps on the German market amounted 
to roughly €1.2 billion in 2017. There are no 
data on the foreign share, but the app stores 
can provide a rough idea: for purchases from 
the Apple store, the foreign enterprise Apple is 
always the counterparty, meaning that all sales 
conducted there are relevant to the balance of 
payments. The situation is less clear- cut for pur -
chases from Android stores, because this plat -
form also sells third- party apps from domestic 
and foreign providers. Taking into account the 
world market shares of both app stores, as well 
as additional data, the foreign share probably 
comes to around 95%, which is roughly equiva -
lent to €1.1 billion.
According to data provided by the Association 
of the German Games Industry (GAME), total 
spending on video games amounted to ap -
proximately €1.9 billion in 2017. This figure 
needs to be adjusted for the share of software 
that is not provided digitally. Moreover, in- app 
game purchases are deducted, since they are 
already included in the mobile applications seg -
ment mentioned above. According to GAME, 
the foreign share relevant to the balance of 
payments is 94%, resulting in remaining sales 
of just under €1 billion with relevance to the 
balance of payments for sales of games pro -
vided digitally.8The state governments’ gambling supervisory 
authorities publish annual reports that include 
benchmark figures for the German gambling 
market, which encompasses private online sports 
and horse racing betting, online casino games, 
online poker and online secondary lotteries.9 
Data for 2013 to 2016 on gross gambling rev -
enue (stakes minus winnings paid out) with 
non- residents, which corresponds to German 
expenditure on gambling, was taken from the 
annual reports. For the most part, these figures 
were only adjusted for the sales generated on 
site at German gambling outlets. Sales for 2017 
were approxi mated using the rate of change in 
tax revenue from betting and lotteries.10 They 
amount to around €2.6 billion in 2017.
Cloud services, which encompass a broad 
range of IT services such as extra storage space 
for hosting a website or backing up data, are 
usually provided by service providers over the 
internet. To calculate private domestic pur -
chases of storage space from foreign providers, 
a model was developed based on data from 
the survey on the private use of information 
and communication technologies (ICT survey) 
carried out by the Federal Statistical Office.11 
Prices for storage space were calculated by 
analysing website cloud service providers’ web -
sites. Because the overwhelming majority of 
the internet providers are domiciled in Ger -
many, only around 5% of cloud users buy stor -
age from foreign providers. This figure comes 
to approximately €0.2 billion for 2017.

to around €6 billion in 2017. Although this 
accounts  for only 2% of the expenditure on 
services recorded in the balance of payments, it 
still represents considerable growth – digital 
purchases from abroad by households have 
almost  doubled since 2014.
Online gambling is the market segment that 
generates the largest volume of sales with rele -
vance to the balance of payments, with a share 
in total sales of over 40%. It is followed by pur -
chases of video games and mobile applications 
for mobile phones, smartphones and tablets, 
which together account for 35%.
The level of the estimated expenditure and its 
dynamic growth underline how significant 
these purchases are to the balance of pay -
ments. Although the prices of the digital ser -
vices purchased by households often amount 
to just a few euros or even merely a few cents, 
together, they actually add up to a consider -
able volume of service imports.
Germany’s current account balance directly 
reflects  the estimated values for private pur -
chases of digital services. The data gap con -
cerns the expenditure side, in particular. On the 
receipts side, most of the revenue generated by 
German companies that provide digital services 
to private customers abroad is assumed to be captured, the reason being that, in practice, 
enterprises often also report micro amounts.
According to the estimates applied to the cur -
rent account for 2014 onwards, private pur -
chases of digital services reduce Germany’s cur -
rent account surplus by between €3 billion and 
€7 billion. For instance, Germany’s current 
account  surplus relative to GDP was 0.2 per -
centage point lower in 2017 than if house -
holds’ digital purchases had been excluded.
Conclusion
From an international perspective, the German 
model is one of the first to attempt to capture 
households’ digital purchases in the balance of 
payments. The figures obtained using this 
method provide an initial indication of the scale 
and dynamics. The granular approach selected 
allows market segments that were not previ -
ously included to be factored in, provided that 
the relevant sources are available. It is also rela -
tively simple to supplement or exchange data 
sources for market segments that have already 
been captured.
The advantage of using freely available internet 
data is that data gaps in the official statistics

However, there are also a number of disadvan -
tages. For instance, there is a risk that the data 
provider in question will stop producing the 
data or stop making them available to the pub -
lic. In addition, checking the quality of internet 
data is not necessarily a simple process, since 
most of the information is taken from the re -
sults of surveys that were not carried out by 
official bodies. Besides this, some of the infor -
mation is only available with a time lag of sev -
eral years, meaning that the data need to be 
extrapolated to the current end.
Added to this is the fact that the data that are 
freely available at present do not meet all the 
requirements of the balance of payments. They are not broken down by country, for example. 
Initial analyses show that a country structure of 
digital purchases cannot be identified on the 
basis of the current data sets. For this reason, 
the estimated sales are shown under the item 
“countries not identified”. Developing an ap -
propriate method for breaking digital purchases 
down by country is a task that still needs to be 
tackled.
The approach presented here should be seen 
as the first step towards capturing internation -
ally traded digital services in the official statis -
tics. Many challenges remain. Cooperation 
with the data providers will play a key role in 
overcoming these challenges.Advantages and

New benchmark rates, new challenges: 
introducing the €STR in the euro area
Sweeping changes to important interest rate benchmarks have been posing major challenges 
particularly to the financial sector, but also to firms and households. To wit, the introduction of 
the new reference rate €STR (Euro Short-  Term Rate) is impacting directly on existing and future 
financial contracts as well as operational and other processes.
Interest rate benchmarks represent key references for many types of financial contracts, such as 
floating rate loan contracts and interest rate derivatives. They are, furthermore, used for the valu -
ation of financial products. Benchmark rates are therefore used by banks and other financial 
institutions as well as by firms and households (for retail mortgages, for instance).
Manipulations of benchmark rates in past years and a considerable decline in turnover in the 
underlying money markets have triggered a reform process which is taking place in all major cur -
rency areas. In Europe, this process culminated in the EU Benchmarks Regulation, which entered 
into force in 2018. This regulation was a catalyst for specific changes to the two most important 
euro benchmark rates: EONIA (Euro OverNight Index Average) and EURIBOR (Euro Interbank 
Offered Rate). Users of LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) also need to prepare for material 
change.
The action necessitated by the superseding of EONIA by the €STR is considerable: by the end of 
2021, market participants will have to migrate all products and contracts referencing EONIA to 
the €STR. The first €STR products, such as interest rate swaps, are already being traded, though 
their market share is still at a very low level. The term benchmark EURIBOR has been thoroughly 
reformed and now meets the requirements of the EU Benchmarks Regulation. However, market 
participants have to include fallbacks in their contracts which would be triggered if the original 
reference rate is discontinued permanently. The available basis for this is the €STR. Moreover, 
users of LIBOR – to date the most important interest rate benchmark for the US dollar, pound 
sterling, Swiss franc and Japanese yen – have to make preparations for its discontinuation after 
2021 and instead use other benchmark rates in future. This will also affect euro area market par -
ticipants using LIBOR as a reference interest rate particularly for their foreign currency operations.
The fundamental change in benchmark rates requires close dialogue between the public and the 
private sector. Central banks are playing an active role in this process, by providing new reference 
rates or by supporting work in this area by private sector working groups. Nonetheless, it is up to 
market participants to develop suitable solutions and implement them in a timely manner. Going 
forward, too, it will therefore be important to strike the right balance between private sector 
responsibility and public sector support.Deutsche Bundesbank

Importance and design of 
interest rate benchmarks
An interest rate benchmark, also known as a 
reference rate or benchmark rate, refers to a 
specific financial market segment for which it is 
intended to be a representative reflection of the 
prevailing market rates. In most cases, they are 
specifically aimed at representing banks’ aver -
age refinancing costs in the money market, or a 
segment thereof. Benchmark rates play a signifi -
cant role in the financial system, as they are 
often used as references in floating rate finan-
cial instruments and contracts.1 They are used in 
products such as interest rate derivatives, money 
market instruments, floating rate securities and 
loan contracts. In addition, the prices of liquid 
interest rate derivatives based on benchmark 
rates are used for the valuation of financial in -
struments. Benchmarks are therefore relevant 
to many different market actors, not only banks 
and other financial institutions but also firms 
and even households, for example regarding 
floating rate loans (including retail mortgages), 
deposits or securities. The markets for financial 
instruments which reference a benchmark rate 
are, in most cases, significantly larger than the 
respective money market segment underlying 
the reference rate, in terms of outstanding vol -
ume and number of contracts. This is especially 
true of derivatives markets, which are of major 
significance for finan  cial market participants’ 
interest rate risk management.2
Since the introduction of the euro, the two 
most important euro benchmark rates have 
been EONIA (Euro OverNight Index Average) 
and EURIBOR (Euro Interbank Offered Rate), 
the latter being a term rate provided for tenors 
ranging from one week to 12 months. Both 
rates are published daily and are administered 
by the European Money Markets Institute 
(EMMI), an association supported by commer -
cial banks and based in Belgium. The key global 
benchmark LIBOR (London Interbank Offered 
Rate), which is published for various tenors and 
curren  cies by the UK-  based ICE Benchmark 
Adminis  tration (IBA), also features a euro-  denominated rate (EUR LIBOR). This rate, how -
ever, is of minor importance compared with 
EURIBOR. The extent of the use of benchmark 
rates can only be approximated since the rele -
vant data are not systematically gathered or are 
gathered only for individual market segments. 
In 2016, the European Commission estimated 
that EURIBOR underpinned a notional value of 
more than €180 trillion in outstanding con -
tracts (mostly interest rate swaps).3 An esti -
mated more than €1 trillion of this figure covers 
floating rate retail mortgages. The importance 
of such retail mortgages varies significantly be -
tween euro area countries. It tends to be small 
in Germany, where fixed interest lending is pre -
dominant. As regards the use of EONIA, the 
European Central Bank (ECB) in 2018 estimated 
that a notional amount of €22 trillion of EONIA- 
linked derivatives contracts were currently out -
standing.4 In 2017, the European Commission 
estimated the outstanding amounts of money 
market instruments in the unsecured and the 
secured market which reference EONIA at a 
minimum of €450 billion and €400 billion, 
respect ively.5 Owing to the use of EONIA- based 
interest rate derivatives for the valuation of 
finan cial instruments, however, the importance 
of EONIA extends far beyond the contracts 
captured in the aforementioned figures.Interest rate

ther party can influence the agreed rate of interest. The 
value of a contract thus remains impartial and indisputable 
(see ECB (2019a)).
2 It needs to be noted here that the volume of interest rate 
derivatives transactions cannot be compared directly with 
the volume of loan or securities transactions since, for 
interest rate derivatives, the notional amount is not the 
amount exchanged.

European Parliament and of the Council. In 2014, the Fi -
nancial Stability Board estimated the notional outstanding 
amount of contracts referencing EURIBOR at around 
US$150 trillion to US$180 trillion. By contrast, the use of 
EUR LIBOR, at an estimated volume of US$2 trillion, was 
significantly lower (by comparison: the total notional out -
standing amount of contracts referencing LIBOR was esti -
mated at US$220 trillion). See FSB (2014)).

Since October 2019 the ECB has been publish -
ing a new euro reference rate, the €STR (Euro 
Short-  Term Rate).6 The introduction of the €STR 
is part of an extensive overhaul of benchmarks 
which is currently ongoing in all major currency 
areas. The manipulation of various benchmark 
rates and the considerable decline in liquidity 
in  the underlying money market segments 
indicated  a need for fundamental reform. This 
led the public sector to develop new inter -
national standards for the production and use 
of benchmarks. These standards have also 
been enshrined in European legislation. Bench -
mark rates should be grounded, where pos -
sible, in a sufficient quantity of actual transac -tions in liquid markets. These requirements also 
necessitated changes to EONIA and EURIBOR. 
In the past, both rates were based on the un -
secured interbank money market. They were 
calculated on the basis of data voluntarily 
reported  by a group of contributing banks, 
known as panel banks. Although data submit -
ted to EONIA were transaction- based, they 
most recently reflected only a very low daily 
trading volume of around €2 billion. EURIBOR, 
like LIBOR, was based on submissions of non-

rather  than actual transactions. EMMI has since 
reformed EURIBOR, which is now calculated 
using a new methodology. Since the introduc -
tion of the €STR, EONIA has no longer been 
based on data reported by panel banks. In -
stead, EMMI has pegged the calculation of 
EONIA directly to the €STR. Publication of 
EONIA will be discontinued in January 2022, 
the deadline by which the €STR will have fully 
replaced EONIA for all purposes.
The purpose of this article is to provide a com -
prehensive overview of efforts to reform interest 
rate benchmarks over the past few years. It will 
start by explaining the background to these de -
velopments and the role played by the public 
sector, including central banks. The €STR and 
what its introduction means for EONIA and 
EURIBOR will subsequently be discussed in fur -
ther detail. In this context, attention will also be 
given to developments regarding LIBOR in order 
to show parallels and differences to the changes 
in the euro area. The article will conclude by look -
ing ahead to the tasks that remain to be done.
Need for reform and 
establishment  of new global 
standards
The representativeness and integrity of existing 
interest rate benchmarks were increasingly 
being called into question in past years. This 
was triggered by news of manipulations, 
particu larly in connection with LIBOR and 
EURIBOR.7 First, there were incidences of con -
tributing panel banks understating their bor -
rowing costs in their submissions. Second, 
some colluded on their submissions to move 
the benchmark rate in a way that worked to 
their advantage.8 In addition, liquidity in the 
unsecured interbank market had dropped sig -
nificantly since the financial crisis. This can be 
attributed to increased aversion to credit risk 
but also to the excess liquidity generated by 
monetary policy measures as well as changes in 
banking regulation.9 The public sector re -
sponded by establishing new standards gov -erning the production of benchmarks.10 Not-
ably, in 2013 the International Organization of 
Securities Commissions (IOSCO), a global asso -
ciation of securities regulators which sets global 
standards for securities market regulation, pub -
lished its Principles for Financial Benchmarks.11 
The IOSCO Principles encompass the areas of 
governance, quality of the benchmark and of 
the methodology, and accountability.
The significant role that benchmarks play within 
the financial system can give rise to risks to 
finan cial stability. In order to ensure that bench -
mark rates are robust and appropriately used, 
the G20 tasked the Financial Stability Board 
(FSB) with coordinating global reform efforts. In 
July 2014 the FSB issued two fundamental rec -
ommendations in this regard: strengthening 
existing benchmarks, and developing alterna -
tive, nearly risk- free rates (RFRs). Reformed or 
new benchmark rates should be anchored in 
observable transactions, wherever feasible, and 
should be robust even in the face of market 
dislocation. They should also minimise the op -
portunities for manipulation.12 This led to the 
formation of working groups in several currency 
areas to identify RFRs and map out paths for 
transitioning from existing benchmark rates to 
RFRs. Although these working groups were 
generally established by the public sector, their 
members generally belong to the private sec -
tor.13 Their results are mostly published as rec -Article provides

10 These standards cover not only interest rate bench -
marks but also other types of benchmarks, including those 
referencing equity, commodity or energy markets. These 
are not covered in this article, however.
11 See IOSCO (2013). Recommendations for regulating 
LIBOR (see Wheatley (2012)) and principles for benchmark- 
setting processes in the EU (see ESMA and EBA (2013)) had 
already been published beforehand.

ommendations. These recommendations are 
frequently preceded by public consultations in 
order to achieve broad market acceptance. 
Moreover, in July 2016 the Official Sector Steer -
ing Group (OSSG)14 of the FSB asked the Inter -
national Swaps and Derivatives Association 
(ISDA) to lead work to improve the robustness 
of derivatives contracts.15 The focus of this work 
across currencies (including the euro) is particu -
larly on the inclusion of contractual fallback pro -
visions which would be triggered if a benchmark 
rate is permanently discontinued.16 The FSB 
does not deem it necessary to use benchmark 
rates that include risk premia (such as for bank 
credit risk) for certain financial transactions (es -
pecially the majority of derivatives transactions). 
In its view, for financial stability reasons an RFR 
should be used instead.17 The work of ISDA is 
therefore focused on the use of RFRs.
In the European Union, the EU Benchmarks 
Regulation (BMR) entered into force on 1 Janu -
ary 2018.18 The BMR, based on the IOSCO Prin -
ciples, stakes out a regulatory framework com -
prising an extensive body of rules governing 
the administrators (i.e. the entity responsible 
for the production) and contributors to bench -
marks as well as the use of these benchmarks. 
For benchmarks which – owing, for instance, 
to widespread use – are considered to be crit -
ical to market integrity, financial stability or 
consumer protection, additional requirements 
apply. For instance, from 1 January 2022 critical 
benchmarks which do not comply with the 
BMR will no longer be permitted to be used in 
newly concluded contracts.19 The relevant 
competent authority can require mandatory 
administration of, or contributions to, critical 
benchmarks for a period of up to five years. In 
August 2016, the European Commission de -
clared EURIBOR a critical benchmark; it did the 
same for EONIA in June 2017.20 At the time, 
neither of the two benchmarks met the re -
quirements of the BMR. Moreover, supervised 
entities which use benchmarks have been 
required , since 1  January 2018, to produce 
“robust  written plans” setting out the actions 
they would take if a benchmark they are using materially changes or ceases to be provided. 
These plans must be reflected in contractual 
relation ships with clients. Contracts entered 
into prior to January 2018 must be amended 
accordingly where feasible and on a best- effort 
basis.21 The competent authority responsible 
for supervising market participants domiciled in 
Germany is the Federal Financial Supervis  ory 
Authority ( Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleis -
tungsaufsicht,  or BaFin).
Role of central banks
Benchmarks are used throughout the financial 
industry and can also be provided by the private 
sector, as is the case for EONIA and EURIBOR, 
for instance. However, manipulations, the more 
stringent international requirements for con -
tributors to benchmarks and the associated 
legal risks have significantly dampened banks’ 
willingness to contribute to the production of 
reference rates in recent years. For instance, 26 
banks have left the EURIBOR panel since 2012, 
taking the current total to 18. Over the same 
period, membership of the EONIA panel fell by 
15 to 28 banks at last count. Unsecured trading International

activity between banks (interbank trading) has 
also decreased considerably in past years. These 
developments are making it increasingly difficult 
to calculate representative money market refer -
ence rates.22
Due to the intensive use of benchmark rates in 
the private sector and their significance within 
the financial system, it is also in the public sec -
tor’s interest for these to be representative and 
reliable. Furthermore, money market reference 
rates play a key role for monetary policy, too. 
For many central banks, short-  term interest 
rates are an operational target when imple -
menting monetary policy. They are often the 
first step in the monetary policy transmission 
mechanism, with the central bank steering 
short- term money market rates at the level of 
the policy rate.23 As long as a reference rate 
representatively reflects the rates at which 
banks lend or borrow liquidity in the short 
term, it can help trace the concrete impact of a 
change in the policy rate. In addition, having a 
money market reference rate that is used as a 
reference in longer- term financial market con -
tracts supports the transmission of the monet -
ary policy stimulus beyond the money market.
The difficulties experienced by private sector 
providers in continuing to supply representative 
benchmark rates, public interest, and the sig -nificance of money market reference rates for 
financial stability and monetary policy have 
prompted central banks to actively assist the 
global reform process. There are two main 
ways in which the Eurosystem is supporting this 
change. First, the Governing Council of the ECB 
decided in September 2017 to introduce the 
unsecured overnight interest rate €STR. Origin -
ally, the €STR was to serve as a complement to 
and backstop for existing benchmark rates pro -
vided by the private sector, such as EONIA.24 
However, the task of providing reference rates 
beyond the overnight tenor should not be 
taken on by the Eurosystem.25 Second, in Sep -Availability of

22 See BIS (2019).
23 See Bindseil (2014).
24 See ECB (2017a). The Governing Council’s justification 
for this decision was twofold. First, interest rate bench -
marks are important for the functioning of financial mar -
kets and the transmission of monetary policy. Second, it 
was uncertain at that time as to whether EONIA would in 
future be recognised as compliant with the requirements of 
the BMR (see Guideline (EU) 2019/ 1265 of the European 
Central Bank of 10 July 2019 on the euro short- term rate 
(€STR) (ECB/ 2019/ 19)). The Governing Council of the ECB 
decided against providing a reference rate on the basis of 
secured transactions as, in the secured market, both liquid -
ity and securities can influence the interest rate. This makes 
the assessment of conditions more difficult, particularly if 
the spectrum of securities concerned is heterogeneous. 
Furthermore, a number of euro repo reference rates are 
already available from private sector providers.
25 The data available do not contain sufficient transactions 
to construct purely transaction- based longer- term refer -
ence rates. Due to a possible (or perceived) conflict of inter -
est with monetary policy, central banks should not provide 
the expert judgement thus necessitated (see ECB (2020)).Deutsche Bundesbank

tember 2017, the ECB, together with Belgium’s 
Financial Services and Markets Authority 
(FSMA), the European Securities and Markets 
Authority (ESMA) and the European Commis -
sion, launched the private sector working group 
on euro risk-free rates (hereinafter referred to as 
the euro area working group).26 The working 
group is composed of members from the pri -
vate sector, while the public sector institutions 
have observer status. The ECB provides the sec -
retariat. Part of the working group’s mandate is 
to identify and recommend alternative euro 
risk- free rates and transition paths.27
In September 2018, the euro area working 
group recommended the €STR as the euro risk- 
free rate, having taken into account feedback 
from market participants.28 In addition to the 
€STR, two secured overnight rates from private 
sector providers were also shortlisted. Market 
participants backed the €STR, for one, because 
it is published by the ECB and is based on data 
which are readily available to the ECB. But 
there was also a clear desire to continue to 
have an unsecured benchmark as they saw this 
to be easier for clients to understand and thus 
simpler to communicate.29 The recommenda -
tion of the €STR as the RFR means that it will 
fully replace EONIA by the end of 2021. The 
€STR is also to serve as the basis for fallbacks 
for products and contracts that reference 
EURIBOR.30
In other currency areas, too, some central 
banks are taking on similar tasks to the Euro -
system. They often provide support for private 
sector working groups in their work on RFRs, 
for instance by taking on organisational func -
tions. Furthermore, a number of major central 
banks have also been providing overnight rates; 
some only since quite recently.31 These rates 
differ in terms of their design – most notably, 
some refer to the secured money market, while 
others are based on the unsecured segment. 
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, for in -
stance, has been publishing the secured over -
night rate SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing 
Rate) since April 2018. The Bank of England has been providing an unsecured overnight rate 
– the reformed SONIA (Sterling Overnight Index 
Average) – also since April 2018.32 The Bank of 
Japan has been producing the unsecured over -
night rate TONA (Tokyo Overnight Average 
rate) since as early as 1993.33 SOFR, SONIA and 
TONA have each been identified as RFRs by the 
corresponding working group responsible. In 
other currency areas, such rates are still pro -
vided by the private sector. The recommended 
RFR in Switzerland, for instance, the secured 
overnight rate SARON (Swiss Average Rate 
Overnight) is published by SIX Swiss Ex -
change.34
The €STR
The ECB published the €STR for the first time 
on 2 October 2019.35 Prior to official daily pub -
lication of the €STR, pre-€STR data were re -
leased at regular intervals for the period dating 
back to March 2017.36 To compute the €STR, 
the ECB uses transaction data for the unsecured 
money market collected by the Eurosystem 
within the scope of its money market statistical Private sector 
working group

the €STR as euro

30 The euro area working group also made recommenda -
tions for fallbacks for the €STR (see Working group on euro 
risk-free rates (2019a)). While the ECB, as a central bank, is 
exempt from the BMR provisions for benchmark adminis -
trators, the use of the €STR falls under the scope of the 
BMR (see ECB (2019d)).
31 Some central banks have extensive statistics on money 
market transactions that can be used as a data basis.
32 SONIA has been calculated since 1997 and was re -
formed by the Bank of England, which, in 2016, took over 
as administrator of the rate (see Bank of England (2018)).
33 In Australia, the Reserve Bank of Australia publishes the 
unsecured overnight rate AONIA (AUD Overnight Index 
Average). In Canada, the Bank of Canada will take over as 
administrator of the secured overnight rate CORRA (Can -
adian Overnight Repo Rate Average) as of June 2020.
34 See BIS (2019).
35 The €STR is always published on the next trading day. 
The first €STR published on 2 October 2019 thus reflected 
trading activity on 1 October 2019.
36 The ECB published pre-€STR data in order to supply 
market participants with information on the future €STR 
from an early stage. The idea was to reduce uncertainty 
and facilitate a smooth transition. The €STR and pre-€STR 
are calculated in the same way, although the pre-€STR took 
into account subsequent data revisions. This was possible 
because pre-€STR data were published with a time lag.Deutsche Bundesbank

The Eurosystem’s money market statistical reporting 
as the basis for calculating the €STR
The Eurosystem introduced money market 
statistical reporting (MMSR) in July 2016.1 
The MMSR requires monetary fi  nancial in-
stitutions (MFIs) domiciled in the euro area 
and selected on the basis of objective 
criteria  to submit daily transaction- by- 
transaction reports detailing their activities 
on the euro money market. The reports for 
a given trading day are available to the 
Euro system not later than 07:00 on the fol-
lowing trading day. They comprise data on 
certain euro- denominated money market 
transactions carried out by the reporting 
insti tutions in the unsecured, secured, for-
eign exchange swap and overnight index 
swap market segments. This provides the 
Eurosystem with granular and timely data 
on developments in the money markets.2The reporting population consists of the 
euro area’s 50 largest MFIs (hereinafter re-
ferred to as the Eurosystem sample).3 The 
Bundesbank is responsible for recording the 
data submitted by 13 institutions domiciled 
in Germany. These data are used in the 
calcula tion of the €STR. In addition, owing 
to the unique features of the German bank-
ing system, the Bundesbank collects data 
from a further 99 banks in Germany in 
order to ensure that the sample is represen-
tative.4 This means that the Bundesbank 
has access to data on the money market 
activities of 112 banks (hereinafter referred 
to as the Bundesbank sample), providing an 
overview of the euro money market in Ger-
many.
The Bundesbank regularly publishes aggre-
gate data from the Bundesbank sample on 
the unsecured money market.5 There has 
been a slight increase in unsecured over-
night borrowing since 2017. At last count, 
i.e. in the eighth reserve maintenance 
period of 2019 (18  December 2019 to 
28  January 2020), transactions averaging 
around €38 billion per day were settled. Of 
those, only around €2.5 billion worth con-
stituted interbank activity, whilst in the fi  rst 
minimum reserve period of 2017 (25 Janu-
ary 2017 to 14 March 2017) the equivalent 
1 The legal basis for the collection of data is provided 
by Regulation (EU) 1333/ 2014 of the European Central 
Bank of 26 November 2014 concerning statistics on 
the money markets (ECB/ 2014/ 48), as amended by 
Regulation (EU) 2015/1599, Regulation (EU) 2019/ 113 
and Regulation (EU) 2019/ 1677.

transactions if, on 31 December 2014, its total main 
balance sheet assets exceeded 0.35% of the total main 
balance sheet assets of all euro area MFIs. A list of re-
porting institutions is published on the ECB’s website.

fi  gure had still been close to €5 billion. As 
such, the share of the market accounted for 
by interbank transactions is now only just 
under 7%. Transactions with other fi  nancial 
and non- fi  nancial counterparties are of 
much greater signifi  cance.
The minor part played by interbank transac-
tions when it comes to unsecured borrow-
ing by German credit institutions also ex-
plains the diverging path taken by the aver-
age interest rates in the interbank market 
and the market as a whole. While the inter-
bank rates do feed into the overall rate, the 
low volumes involved mean that their infl  u-
ence there is only slight. The average inter-
bank rate exhibits a greater degree of vola-
tility as, after all, larger single transactions 
can indeed have a perceptible impact on 
the aggregate rate. Furthermore, the overall 
interest rate is generally higher than both 
the interbank rate and the interest rate on 
the deposit facility. This is due, in particular, 
to transactions with non- fi  nancial corpor-
ations, where a negative interest rate is 
rarely applied.
On the basis of the data published by the 
Bundesbank, it is not possible to draw any 
conclusions as to the contribution to the 
€STR made by banks domiciled in Germany. 
This is because of defi  nition- related differ-
ences arising not only as a result of the dif-
ferent samples being drawn upon. For ex-
ample, the €STR only captures deposits by 
fi  nancial counterparties. The MMSR data 
also contain transactions with non- fi  nancial 
counterparties, that is to say with non- 
fi  nancial corporations classifi  ed as whole-
sale customers and with general govern-
ment. Moreover, alongside deposits, the 
MMSR also covers call money/ call accounts 
plus trading of short- term securities on the 
primary market. In particular, open- basis 
transactions (referred to in Germany as “Bis- 
auf- Weiteres” transactions), which are re-ported as call accounts and play a rather 
signifi  cant role in Germany, do not feed into 
the calculation of the €STR as they are used 
only in a very small number of euro area 
countries and there is no harmonised legal 
framework in place for that particular fi  nan-
cial product.6 Furthermore, trimming is 
applied  for the €STR, meaning that particu-
larly high and particularly low rates are ex-
cluded from the calculation.

reporting (MMSR). Even if the IOSCO Principles 
and the BMR do not apply to central banks in 
their capacity as benchmark administrators, the 
ECB has transposed the standards set out 
therein for the production of the €STR, where 
relevant and appropriate.37There are a number of differences between the 
€STR and EONIA. The €STR covers a larger set 
of banks. While EONIA reflects lending activity, 
the €STR is based on borrowing transactions, 
covering various financial counterparties’ de -
posits with reporting banks. These counterpar -
ties may include banks, money market funds, 
investment and pension funds, insurance cor -
porations and other financial agents such as 
central banks. As such, the sectoral coverage of 
the €STR is significantly broader than for 
EONIA, which captured transactions between 
banks only. This is because of the fact that the 
interbank market now accounts for a far 
smaller share of the money market, while other 
financial counterparties have gained in signifi -
cance.38 The wider set of counterparties is to 
shield against manipulation and ensure that 
the €STR provides a reliable reflection of the 
interest rate applying to unsecured overnight 
borrowing in the euro area.39 Since the €STR 
was first published in October 2019, daily re -
ported €STR volumes have averaged over €30 
billion, compared with an EONIA volume of 
around €2 billion at last count.
Owing to the difference between lending and 
borrowing and the fact that transactions with 
non- banks are also included in the calculation, 
the €STR fixes at lower levels than EONIA. 
Looking at the pre-€STR data, there was a rela -
tively constant spread between the pre-€STR 
and EONIA. For the interbank rate EONIA, the 
Eurosystem’s interest rate on the deposit facility 
(hereinafter referred to as the deposit facility 
rate) functions as a floor. Since the panel banks 
have the option of placing their liquidity in the 
deposit facility, they are not willing to deposit it 
in the market at a lower interest rate. The €STR, 
meanwhile, also takes account of transactions 
with counterparties which do not have access The €STR repre -

€STR calculation method and procedure triggered in 
the event of temporarily insuﬃ   cient data availability 
(contingency  procedure)*
 The €STR is calculated for each TARGET2 
business day as a volume- weighted, trimmed 
mean on the basis of transactions con-
ducted and settled on a given TARGET2 
business day. Only transactions with a value 
of at least €1 million are included. The ECB 
publishes  the €STR, rounded to three deci-
mal places, at 08:00 CET on the next 
TARGET2 business day. If errors  that affect 
the rate by more than 2 basis point s are de-
tected following standard publication,  the 
€STR  is revised and re- published on the 
same day by no later than 09:00 CET.
The volume- weighted, trimmed mean is 
calculated by:
1. ordering transactions from the lowest 
rate to the highest rate;
2. aggregating the transactions occurring 
at each rate level;
3. removing the top and bottom 25% in 
volume terms (trimming); and
4. calculating the mean of the remaining 
50% of the volume- weighted distribu-
tion of rates.
If data availability is temporarily insuffi   cient, 
a contingency procedure for calculating  the 
€STR is triggered. This happens where:
1. the number of reporting banks is less 
than 20; or
2. fi  ve banks account for 75% or more of 
total transaction volumes.
These two criteria are intended to address, 
amongst other things, cases where there is 
an overall lack of data or where systems break down, preventing a suffi   cient data 
feed, thereby impairing the calculation of a 
representative transactio ns- based rate.
If the contingency procedure is triggered, 
 the €STR  is calculated based on transactions 
from both the previous TARGET2 business 
day and the day before that. If  that  is not 
suffi   cient, transactions from successively 
earlier days will be incorporated into the 
€STR calculation until the two criteria are 
no longer met. It has not yet been neces-
sary to apply the contingency procedure.

to the Eurosystem deposit facility.40 Particularly 
in the current environment of excess liquidity, 
these counterparties are ready to part with 
liquid ity at rates below the deposit facility 
rate.41 Although the deposit facility rate does 
not function as a lower bound for the €STR, 
the two rates are closely linked. Indeed, the 
pass- through of the ECB’s deposit facility rate 
cut effective as from 18 September 2019 was 
full and immediate, as shown by the pre-€STR 
data. Monetary policy steering of the €STR is 
therefore not impaired.
Transition from EONIA to the 
€STR
As the administrator of EONIA, EMMI launched 
a reform process in 2016 with the objective of 
complying with the BMR requirements. Due to 
its transaction-  based calculation methodology, 
EONIA was long regarded as a suitable RFR.42 
However, EMMI came to the conclusion that 
without modifying the definition and calcula -
tion methodology, it was not possible to adjust 
EONIA so as to comply with the requirements 
contained in the BMR. This prompted EMMI to 
halt its work on reforming EONIA in February 
2018.43 As a consequence, use of EONIA in 
new contracts would have been precluded 
once the BMR transitional period came to an end. In selecting the €STR as the euro risk- free 
rate, the euro area working group therefore 
also recommended that EONIA be replaced by 
the €STR.44
The euro area working group mapped out a 
transition path from EONIA to the €STR, and 
this is being implemented by EMMI in accord -
ance with the working group’s recommenda -
tions.45 For a limited period of transition, EONIA 
is being calculated on the basis of the €STR. 
EMMI changed its methodology for calculating 
EONIA once €STR publication began on 2 Oc -
tober 2019. Since then, EONIA has been calcu -
lated as the €STR plus a fixed spread of 8.5 
basis points. This spread captures the historical 
difference between EONIA (interbank/ lending) 
and the pre-€STR (interbank and other financial 
counterparties/ borrowing) across a 12- month 
period and was determined by the ECB using a 
methodology recommended by the euro area 
working group.46 Since the change in the cal -
culation methodology meant shifting publica -
tion of EONIA to the following business day, 
market participants needed to make corres -
ponding technical adjustments. The change -
over went smoothly.47 With this new set- up in 
place, in December 2019 the FSMA as the com -
petent supervisory authority authorised EMMI 
as the administrator of EONIA, in application of 
the BMR.48 The requirements laid down in the 
BMR are thus considered met and EONIA quali -
fies as BMR- compliant.
The transition period, during which the €STR 
and EONIA are being published in parallel, ends 
on 3 January 2022. In line with the euro area EONIA is to be 
fully replaced by 
the €STR …… and is

working group’s recommendation, EMMI will 
discontinue publication of EONIA on that 
date.49 By then, the transition from EONIA to 
the €STR must therefore be complete. This is 
the first time worldwide that such a pathway 
has been used for the transition from an exist -
ing interest rate benchmark to its successor.
The ongoing transition from EONIA to the €STR 
calls for extensive preparatory work and adjust -
ments since EONIA is used in a multitude of fi -
nancial instruments. For instance, the market 
for euro- denominated overnight index swaps 
(OISs) references EONIA as the floating rate. 
But EONIA also plays a significant role for the 
wider derivatives market beyond OISs. For ex -
ample, EONIA is used as the cash collateral re -
muneration rate for collateralised derivatives, 
and the EONIA OIS curve is used for discount -
ing future cash flows in the valuation of deriva -
tives, including those referencing EURIBOR. 
Outside the derivatives market, EONIA serves, 
among other things, as a floating rate for 
short-  term securities (e.g. commercial paper, 
certificates of deposit) or repos. It can also have 
a bearing on retail customers in cases where it 
is used to determine interest on giro and sav -
ings accounts or overdraft facilities. In addition, 
EONIA is also of relevance for domains such as 
risk management and financial accounting.50 
The euro area working group published com -
prehensive recommendations for these areas, 
in order to facilitate the transition to the €STR.51 
Market participants have been asked to actively 
transition from EONIA to the €STR in a timely 
manner, when feasible, by replacing products 
referencing EONIA with €STR- based products 
and scaling back EONIA legacy business as 
soon as possible. Market makers are instructed 
to proactively price using the €STR, rather than 
EONIA, as their default. The euro area working 
group’s expectation is that market liquidity for 
€STR- based products will reach at least the 
level of the current EONIA markets.52
Market participants need to amend any con -
tracts referencing EONIA maturing after 31 De -
cember 2021.53 There are no legislative provi -sions envisaged. Wherever possible, EONIA 
should be replaced by the €STR. Market partici -
pants can agree on compensation mechanisms 
designed to avoid undesired value transfers 
arising in connection with the replacement of 
EONIA by the €STR. Alternatively, robust fall -
back provisions that will come into effect when 
publication of EONIA is discontinued can be 
introduced.54 In this context, the euro area 
working group recommends incorporating the 
€STR plus a spread of 8.5 basis points as a fall -
back.55 Preferably, new contracts should no 
longer reference EONIA.56 In Germany, the 
requisite contractual amendments need to be 
made to the German master agreements for 
finan  cial transactions (Deutsche Rahmenver -
träge für Finanzgeschäfte)  and their addenda, 
too.57 The documentation is drawn up by a 
cross- association working group of the Associ -
ation of German Banks (Bundesverband deut -
scher Banken)  in consultation with the German 
Banking Industry Committee (Deutsche Kredit -Transition affects

ing group also published a public consultation addressing 
specific issues relating to swaptions (see Working group on 
euro risk- free rates (2020b)).
52 In this context, liquid €STR derivatives markets are con -
sidered a precondition for the transition of the other prod -
ucts to allow hedging of €STR- based products (see Work -
ing group on euro risk- free rates (2020a)).
53 See Working group on euro risk- free rates (2019e).
54 In respect of derivatives falling within the scope of the 
European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), the 
Chair of the euro area working group sent a letter in July 
2019 asking ESMA and the European Commission to issue 
an assurance that the incorporation of fallback provisions 
or the replacement of EONIA with the €STR, including 
when taking into account a spread or any other type of 
compensation mechanism, would not have the effect of 
imposing margin or clearing obligations under EMIR (see 
Van Rijswijk (2019)). Work is currently underway looking 
into corresponding legal provisions (see Dombrovskis 
(2019a) and ECB (2019d)).
55 This aligns the recommended fallback with the method -
ology for calculating EONIA during the transition period 
and means there would be no value transfer in the event of 
the fallback being triggered.
56 See Working group on euro risk- free rates (2019e).
57 The relevant agreements in this context are the master 
agreement for financial derivatives transactions (Deutscher 
Rahmenvertrag für Finanztermingeschäfte) , the master 
agreement for securities lending (Deutscher Rahmenver -
trag für Wertpapierdarlehen)  and the master agreement 
for repurchase transactions (repos) ( Deutscher Rahmenver -
trag für Wertpapierpensionsgeschäfte  (Repos)).Deutsche Bundesbank

wirtschaft).  This group is currently drafting a 
supplementary agreement which contracting 
parties can use to migrate the references used 
in the master agreements and addenda, exist -
ing collateral agreements and individual con -
tracts from EONIA to the €STR. The supplemen -
tary agreement will also enable market partici -
pants to incorporate fallback provisions.
The discontinuation of EONIA in January 2022 
means that OIS trading needs to be fully transi -
tioned to the €STR. This also impacts German 
market participants. In the 12 months leading 
up to the introduction of the €STR (i.e. from 
1 October 2018 to 30 September 2019), Ger -
man banks required to report to the Bundes -
bank under the MMSR recorded around 9,300 
OIS transactions with a notional amount total -
ling just under €5 trillion.58 30 reporting institu -
tions engaged in transactions with around 100 
counterparties (approximately 80 of which fell 
outside the group subject to reporting require -
ments), with the majority of the volume being traded via central counterparties (CCPs). Trades 
with maturities extending beyond the end of 
2021, some of which run until 2069, make up 
just under half of all transactions and account 
for less than 10% of the total turnover. Since 
the €STR was introduced, participants in the 
euro money market have already been trading 
the first €STR swaps.59 The CCPs LCH and Eurex 
Clearing began offering clearing of €STR swaps 
in October 2019 and November 2019, respect -
ively.60 The monthly volume of €STR swaps re -
corded through LCH SwapClear has so far risen 
from just short of €27 billion in October 2019 
to around €181 billion in February 2020 (total 
outstanding volume at the end of February: 
€279 billion, the majority of which maturing in 
under one year). Eurex Clearing’s monthly vol -
ume for February 2020 stood at just under €7 
billion (with amounts in previous months ran -
ging between €10 billion and €16 billion). 
However, at around 3% at last count, €STR 
swaps still only account for a very small share 
of the OISs being cleared via CCPs on a monthly 
basis compared with EONIA swaps. Both CCPs 
have furthermore announced that they will be 
switching their cash collateral remuneration 
rate (price alignment interest, or PAI) and dis -
counting from EONIA to the €STR on or around 
22 June 2020.61 In doing so, they are following 
the recommendation of the euro area working 
group to perform the switch preferably to -
wards the end of the second quarter of 2020. 
Market participants are encouraged to then 
take a phased approach to transitioning the 
cash collateral remuneration rate as defined 
within their bilateral credit support annexes 
(CSAs).62 In Germany, this includes the collat -
eral addenda to the German master agreement

Looking back: the replacement of FIBOR by EONIA and 
EURIBOR when introducing the euro in 1999
Until the beginning of monetary union, 
FIBOR (Frankfurt Interbank Offered Rate) 
was a key benchmark rate for DM interest 
rates with overnight tenor and tenors from 
one to twelve months, especially for banks 
in Germany. It was introduced in August 
1985 with the Bundesbank’s support as an 
alternative  benchmark to DM- LIBOR. Issuing  
fl  oating rate bonds had been permitted in 
Germany since April 1985, and these bonds 
were to reference an interest rate set in 
Germany. FIBOR was published by a private 
sector provider, Privatdiskont AG.
The introduction of the euro in 1999 
brought with it the transition to new, Euro-
pean benchmarks – EURIBOR and EONIA. 
The calculation of FIBOR was discontinued. 
In Germany, the transition from FIBOR to 
the new rates was implemented by means 
of a statutory order – the FIBOR Transition 
Regulation (FIBOR-Überleitungs-Verordnung,  
or FIBOR- VO) of 10 July 1998.1 This order 
replaced  FIBOR with EURIBOR in the acqui-
sition of one- month to twelve- month funds, 
while for overnight funds FIBOR was super-
seded by EONIA.2
A statutory regulation was considered ex-
pedient in order to ensure a seamless mi-
gration of existing legislation and contracts 
and thereby provide legal certainty . Accord-
ing to the Federal Ministry of Finance, the 
fact that the new rates matched the old 
benchmark rates “in their nature and man-
ner of collection”, i.e. they assumed pre-
cisely the role of FIBOR in terms of their 
characteristics, was an argument in favour 
of the legislative solution.3
A key component of the transition was the 
explicit  regulatory provision governing the 
continuity of contracts under civil law.4 This 
prevented contracting parties from assert-
ing contractual frustration as a result of the 
relevant benchmark’s replacement and allowed existing contracts to remain in 
force unchanged using the new interest 
rates. At the same time, the principle of 
freedom of contract remained unaffected 
by FIBOR’s replacement, which meant that 
the contracting parties were also able to 
agree on a different benchmark rate from 
EURIBOR or EONIA.
The statutory order to replace FIBOR thus 
formed part of the body of legislation on 
the introduction of the euro in Germany. 
The replacement of national currencies by 
the single currency of the euro can there-
fore be seen as a particular exception that 
prompte d the regulation by statutory order 
of the transition between different bench-
mark rates provided and used by the private 
sector that accompanied the introduction 
of the eur o. No statutory regulation is 
planned for the transition from EONIA to 
the €STR.5
1 These were decreed by the Federal Government in 
performance of Section 3(2) No 2 of the Discount Rate 
Transition Act (Diskontsatz-Überleitungs-Gesetz, or 
DÜG). The DÜG is a component of the Act on the 
Introduction of the Euro (Euro-Einführungsgesetz, or 
EuroEG) of 9 June 1998. In France, too, legislation was 
issued on the transition of the local benchmarks PIBOR 
(Paris Interbank Offered Rate) and TMP (“taux moyen 
pondéré”). The corresponding French statutory order 
was very similar to the one issued in Germany (see 
Folter (1998)).
2 In July 1990, FIBOR was adjusted to international 
conventions (additional tenors, actual/ 360 day- count 
method of calculation, two- day settlement and ex-
panding the panel from 12 to 19 banks). FIBOR refer-
ence rates which drew on a basis that applied prior to 
the adjustment were also superseded by EURIBOR, 
although  this had to be multiplied by a correction fac-
tor in order to offset the effect of the different day 
count convention.
3 See Federal Ministry of Finance (1998).
4 See Section 4 sentence 1 of the DÜG.
5 In the United States, the ARRC recently published a 
proposal for legislation on the introduction of SOFR- 
based fallback provisions in contracts that reference 
USD LIBOR and are governed by New York State law 
(see ARRC (2020a)).Deutsche Bundesbank

ing parties will be able to make use of the sup -
plementary agreement mentioned above for 
this. It is generally expected that the €STR swap 
market will develop further especially once the 
CCPs have switched to the €STR in June 2020.
Outside the derivatives market, the majority of 
contracts and financial instruments referenced 
to EONIA have short maturities ending before 
the end of 2021.63 Where these cash products 
are concerned, cancellation or amendment of 
legacy contracts is therefore less relevant. The 
euro area working group recommends transi -
tioning to the €STR as soon as possible. Short- 
term securities should no longer be issued on 
the basis of EONIA, for example.64 The first 
€STR short- term securities have already been is -
sued. In line with the recommendation of the 
International Capital Market Association 
(ICMA), repos traded in the interbank market 
should be based on a fixed rate rather than a 
floating rate.65 Generally, only a small propor -
tion of repos are transacted on a floating rate 
basis. This share has fallen further since the 
introduction of the €STR.66
The €STR as a basis for 
EURIBOR fallbacks
In response to the discussion surrounding new 
standards for the production of benchmark 
rates, EMMI – in its capacity as the administra -
tor of EURIBOR – started the process of reform -
ing the expert- judgement- based EURIBOR early 
on. In particular, the calculation methodology 
was to be changed to one that is underpinned 
to the greatest extent possible with transaction 
data.67 In the end, EMMI developed a hybrid   
methodology that first takes transaction data 
into account, but draws on expert judgement 
in the absence of sufficient transactions.68 The 
reformed EURIBOR reflects borrowing activity 
in the unsecured money market (i.e. not only 
the interbank market but now also transactions 
with financial counterparties outside the bank -
ing sector and with general government), while 
the calculation continues to be based on the voluntary contributions from a panel of banks. 
EMMI completed the phase- in of EURIBOR’s 
new methodology in November 2019.69 Against 
this background, EMMI had already  received 
authorisation from the FSMA as the administra -
tor of EURIBOR in July 2019, in application of 
the BMR.70 EURIBOR is thus considered BMR-  
compliant and can be used until further no -
tice.71 In contrast, users of LIBOR need to pre -
pare for the discontinuation of rates after the 
end of 2021.
EURIBOR’s long- term viability will depend on 
the administrator and the willingness of the 
panel banks to continue contributing to the 
calculation as well as on the liquidity of the 
underlying market going forward. Even if 
EURIBOR can continue to be used, it will there -
fore be necessary to improve the robustness of 
contracts referencing EURIBOR by incorporat -
ing suitable fallback provisions.72 This includes 
determining objective triggers that would acti -
vate the fallback. In this respect, the BMR con -
siders material changes to or cessation of a 
benchmark as triggers. In the past, contracts 
were frequently concluded without fallback 
provisions or only included provisions intended 
to address the temporary unavailability of the 
benchmark rate. In order to fulfil the IOSCO 
Principles and the requirements of the BMR, 
contracts need to also contain provisions for 
the event that the benchmark used ceases to 
be provided, however. This acts to mitigate 
legal and operational risk.73 To this end, the 
euro area working group has been looking at 
potential fallbacks based on the €STR. It needs 
to be noted here that these two rates differ in 
terms of their tenor (overnight for the €STR … whilst other

and one week to twelve months for EURIBOR) 
and their risk profile (the €STR without risk pre -
mia). This means that corresponding adjust -
ments are necessary. To adjust the tenor, it is 
possible to calculate risk- free term rates based 
on the €STR. A distinction is made here be -
tween backward-looking and forward-looking 
calculation methods.74 The difference com -
pared to EURIBOR due to the risk premia in -
cluded in EURIBOR is to be offset by adding a 
spread (“adjustment spread”).75
Backward- looking term rates are determined 
by averaging the realised €STR fixings across a 
time horizon matching the respective tenor, 
whilst at times also taking into account com -
pounding effects.76 Unlike in the case of 
EURIBOR, this does not map any expectations 
regarding future interest rate movements, 
whereas changes in interest rates that occur 
during the time horizon are captured in the cal -
culation. In general, the applicable interest rate 
– and consequently the amount of interest to 
be paid – is only known at the end of the cal -
culation period. Should this be undesirable for 
market participants seeking greater budget 
planning, cashflow and risk management cer -
tainty, for example, there are a number of dif -
ferent calculation options available to them, 
although in these cases the observation period 
(i.e. the €STR fixings included in the calculation) 
and the interest period (i.e. the period to which 
the calculated interest rate applies) are not 
congruent or not fully congruent. This means 
that interest rate changes that took place in the 
interest period are not necessarily taken into 
account.77 Because the €STR is publicly avail -
able, and historical data are also available for a 
certain time period in the shape of the pre-
€STR, market participants are already able to 
calculate backward-  looking €STR term rates.78 
Common market conventions for calculating 
these term rates or their publication will make 
their uniform application possible.
Forward- looking term rates factor in expect -
ations regarding interest rate movements and 
are already available at the start of the interest period.79 For the €STR, these rates could be de -
rived from the €STR derivatives markets. The 
euro area working group looked into different 
methods for calculating these and recom -
mended a methodology based on tradable 
€STR OIS quotes, provided that certain require -
ments are met, such as sufficient market liquid -
ity, transparent and regulated trading and data 
sufficiency.80 Multiple potential administrators 
have expressed interest in producing €STR-  
based forward- looking term rates.81 A robust, 
€STR-based forward-looking term structure can 
only be expected to be available, however, 
once the €STR derivatives markets are suffi -
ciently liquid.
The cross- currency work performed by ISDA on 
fallbacks for derivatives referencing interbank 
offered rates (IBORs) includes fallback provi -
sions for EURIBOR as well. A corresponding 
market consultation, which also covers EUR 
LIBOR, was published in December 2019.82 In 
this market consultation, ISDA proposed to use 
backward- looking compounded term rates 
(“compounded setting in arrears rate approach 
with a backward- shift adjustment”) with an ad -
justment spread based on historical data (“his -
torical median over a five- year lookback 
period”). This approach was affirmed by the 
vast majority of respondents.83 The method -
ology used here is consistent with the approach 
preferred by market participants in earlier con -
sultations on IBORs of other currencies (espe -Backward-

cially LIBOR) and would therefore create con -
sistency across currencies. According to the 
recommendations of the FSB OSSG, forward-  
looking fallback rates were not considered.84 
The fallbacks are to be activated in the event of 
cessation of EURIBOR, in line with the approach 
for the respective benchmark rates in other cur -
rency areas. They might potentially also be ac -
tivated even before permanent discontinuation 
(“pre-cessation trigger”, especially if the rate 
were to be declared non- representative).85 Im-
plementation of the fallbacks and their triggers 
is scheduled for 2020 by means of an amend -
ment to the definitions referred to in the ISDA 
master agreement, which apply to new con -
tracts.86 Moreover, ISDA is planning to publish 
a protocol which market participants can use 
to supplement legacy contracts. The fallback 
provisions will be included in legacy contracts if 
both contracting parties adhere to the protocol 
(or otherwise agree bilaterally to amend their 
contracts accordingly).87
The euro area working group’s work on €STR- 
based fallbacks for EURIBOR has not yet been 
concluded. In particular, the analysis of the role 
played by backward- looking approaches com -
pared to forward- looking approaches with re -
spect to the various asset classes for which 
EURIBOR is used is still pending.88 Taking ac -
count of international developments and ISDA’s 
work, this analysis has to weigh up consider -
ations regarding cross- currency consistency 
and possible idiosyncrasies of the euro area 
that may necessitate a different approach. Not -
ably, the significant role that EURIBOR plays in 
the retail markets of certain euro area countries 
should be borne in mind.
The euro area working group has issued initial 
high- level recommendations for incorporating 
fallback provisions in contracts referencing 
EURIBOR.89 For instance, market participants 
can use generic language to incorporate fall -
backs, triggers and adjustment spreads as long 
as the working group has not issued any spe -
cific recommendations in this regard. For de -
rivatives transactions executed outside the scope of ISDA, the working group recommends 
amending the relevant master agreements 
(such as the German master agreement for 
finan cial derivatives transactions in Germany) in 
line with ISDA’s work, if possible. The working 
group also draws attention to the implications 
of inconsistencies in fallbacks and their triggers 
across asset classes or currencies for risk man -
agement and financial accounting. For ex -
ample, consistency across asset classes may be 
necessary to achieve hedge effectiveness (i.e. 
uniform fallback provisions for hedges and 
hedged items).90 Furthermore, market partici -
pants might also need to make technical ad -
justments, for example to depict backward-  
looking term rates in their IT systems, including 
loan- processing systems.
In addition to using €STR- based fallbacks, in 
principle market participants can also opt for 
the €STR as a direct alternative to EURIBOR. 
One factor that might have a bearing on this 
decision is how developments evolve in other 
currency areas on account of the progressive 
transition from LIBOR to RFRs. This would be 
conceivable, for example, for products involv -… while the

84 See FSB (2018).
85 See ISDA (2019a, 2020b). ISDA’s work on pre-cessation 
triggers has focused on LIBOR hitherto.
86 The ISDA master agreement is used as standard docu -
mentation for over- the- counter (OTC) derivatives. In add -
ition to the ISDA master agreement, CCPs that offer clear -
ing of derivatives also reference the definitions provided by 
ISDA (see ISDA (2019a)).

quirements and clearing obligations under EMIR are an -
other factor to consider (see Van Rijswijk (2019) and Dom -
brovskis (2019a)). As regards hedge accounting, the Inter -
national Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has amended 
certain accounting standards in order to take account of 
existing uncertainties during the IBOR reform processes 
(see IASB 2019)). These amendments were also transposed 
into European legislation (see Commission Regulation (EU) 
2020/ 34 of 15  January 2020 amending Regulation (EC) 
No 1126/ 2008). The IASB’s considerations on the potential 
consequences on financial accounting of replacing an 
existing benchmark with an alternative are still pending. In 
Germany, the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany ( Insti-
tut der Wirtschaftsprüfer in Deutschland,  or IDW) has pub -
lished a comment on the implications for financial account -
ing under commercial law of the reform of certain interest 
rate benchmarks for financial instruments (IDW RH FAB

Upcoming discontinuation of LIBOR and role of RFRs
LIBOR is provided daily for the USD, GBP , 
CHF, EUR and JPY for several tenors.1 
Accord ing to the FSB, LIBOR is the most ref-
erenced benchmark in USD, GBP , CHF and 
JPY. In 2014, the FSB estimated the notional 
amount of outstanding contracts that refer-
ence LIBOR at around US$220 trillion, with 
USD LIBOR accounting for the largest 
share.2 In December 2017, the European 
Commission  declared LIBOR  a critical 
benchmark under the BMR.3 In order to 
meet the requirements contained in the 
IOSCO  Principles and in the BMR, LIBOR 
was reformed by its administrator, IBA. In 
April 2019, IBA completed the transition to 
a reformed methodology, based fi  rst on 
transaction data. If the  available transaction 
data  are not suffi   cient, expert judgement is 
used. The reformed LIBOR is designed to 
refl  ect  the refi  nancing costs of large, inter-
nationally active banks in the unsecured 
 money market, i.e. covering both the inter-
bank market as well as transactions with 
other counterparties, in some cases beyond 
the fi  nancial sector.4  IBA had been author-
ised as administrator pursuant to the BMR 
by the competent supervisory authority, the 
UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA),  back 
in April 2018.5
However, after the reform, LIBOR  is still 
chiefl  y calculated based on expert judge-
ment due to the low level of liquidity in the 
underlying market, i.e. in the unsecured 
money market for tenors of up to 12 
months. The FCA thus questioned the sus-
tainability of LIBOR. In July 2017, Andrew 
Bailey, Chief Executive of the FCA, con-
fi  rmed that the FCA will no longer persuade 
panel banks to voluntarily contribute to 
LIBOR beyond the end of 2021,  nor will  it 
make this compulsory. Market   participants 
 will therefore have to prepare for LIBOR to be discontinued and ensure that they have 
transitioned to alternative  transactions-  
based reference rates by the end of 2021.6 
Furthermore, the FCA indicates that LIBOR, 
if calculated beyond the end of 2021, might 
not pass its representativeness test.7 As part 
of its work programme, the FSB will moni-
tor progress made in transitioning from 
LIBOR in 2020 and report to the G20 on 
remaining challenges.8
The working groups in the United States, 
the United Kingdom and Switzerland are 
thus   mapping out the transition from LIBOR 
to the corresponding RFR (SOFR, SONIA 
and SARON, respectively).9 In Japan, the 
reformed  TIBOR (Tokyo Interbank Offered 
Rate) is expected to continue to be used 
alongside the RFR TONA.10 This means, fi  rst, 
that the RFR  will be used as the standard 
reference rate and that new products and 
contracts  will no longer be concluded based 
on LIBOR. Second, products and contracts

ments (BIS) estimated this fi  gure to be closer to around 
US$400 trillion as of mid- 2018 (see BIS (2019)). As 
mentioned above, EUR LIBOR is only of secondary im-
portance, as EURIBOR is in more frequent use.

requirements in place to date will therefore also apply 
after Brexit (see FCA (2020a)).

(both legacy and new) that still reference 
LIBOR should either be actively changed to 
the RFR (or RFR- based term rates) or should 
contain appropriate fallbacks. The focus is 
on using backward- looking methods.11 In 
the United States, the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York began publishing backward- 
looking SOFR term rates in March 2020.12 In 
the United Kingdom and Switzerland, too, 
the administrators of SONIA (Bank of Eng-
land) and SARON (SIX) are planning on pub-
lishing backward- looking term rates.13 
While the calculation of forward- looking 
term rates is also being examined, it is likely 
 that – if available in  future – their use will 
remain limited. According to the FSB, for 
reasons of fi  nancial stability, as a rule de-
rivatives should reference RFRs rather than 
less robust term rates derived from RFR 
deriva tives markets. The use of such rates   is 
set to  be limited outside of derivatives mar-
kets.14 The Working Group on Sterling Risk- 
Free Reference Rates intends SONIA- based 
forward- looking term rates to be used in 
cash products only in exceptional cases, for 
instance for smaller fi  rms or retail custom-
ers.15 SONIA- based forward- looking term 
rates are expected to be published for the 
fi  rst time in the third quarter of  2020 and 
SOFR- based rates  by the end of 2021.16 The 
development of term rates is also being 
advanced  in Japan, with publication ex-
pected to begin in mid- 2021.17 By contrast, 
the assumption in Switzerland is that no 
robust  forward- looking term rates on the 
basis of SARON derivatives markets will be 
  available.18
For derivatives, ISDA conducted public con-
sultations on RFR- based backward- looking 
fallbacks for all LIBOR currencies.19 At the 
request of the FSB OSSG, ISDA is continuing 
to work on incorporating pre- cessation trig-
gers, which would enable a fallback to take 
effect before the reference rate is discon-
tinued. This would be relevant in particular if   the FCA were to declare LIBOR as not 
being representative.20
According to the FSB, the development of 
RFR markets in derivatives and securities is 
making good progress; however, transition 
needs to accelerate for loans and securitisa-
tions. In the United States, new markets are 
developing for SOFR futures and swaps, 
and SOFR bonds ( fl  oating rate notes, 
FRNs).21 Transition from USD LIBOR to SOFR 
is, however, still lagging behind the tran-
sition from GBP LIBOR to SONIA.22 In the 
United Kingdom, SONIA has become the 
standard for newly issued  fl  oating rate 
bonds and securitisations. According to the 
FCA, as of March 2020, SONIA should be 
the standard for quoting swaps and, as of 
the third quarter of 2020, new loans should 
only reference SONIA and no longer 
LIBOR.23 The Bank of England announced 
that, as of 2022, it would no longer accept 
securities or loans referencing LIBOR as 
collat eral for its monetary policy oper-

could be considered as an alternative (see Working

ISDA Benchmarks Supplement, which market partici-
pants can make use of to improve the contractual 
robust ness of derivatives. The ISDA Benchmarks Sup-
plement contains generic  fallback provisions that can 
be used as an interim solution for contracts referen-
cing IBORs (see ISDA (2018)).

ing several currencies, such as cross- currency 
swaps or loans to non- financial corporations 
that can be drawn down in multiple currencies, 
where the transactions reference RFRs for other 
currencies.91 Moreover, new conventions in 
other markets, such as the transition in the 
sterling bond market from GBP LIBOR to 
SONIA, could also play a role. The first €STR 
bonds have already been issued, for instance.92
Outlook
Current global developments in benchmark re -
form are ushering in sweeping changes that af -
fect a large number of business areas and 
stakeholders and pose major challenges to the 
market participants involved. For the euro area, 
the introduction of the €STR marks the first big 
step in the path of reform towards using robust 
risk- free reference rates. It is now up to market 
participants across the board to actively pursue 
the use of the €STR and establish liquid, €STR- based markets. The transition from EONIA to 
the €STR, including the amendment of con -
tracts referencing EONIA, needs to be com -
pleted in full by the end of 2021. At the same 
time, workable €STR- based fallback provisions 
need to be incorporated into contracts referen -
cing EURIBOR in order to improve their robust -
ness. Despite the fact that the reformed 
EURIBOR can continue to be used as a bench -
mark rate beyond 2021, market participants 
should be prepared for all eventualities. With 
that in mind, robust fallbacks should also be 
integrated into legacy contracts, wherever pos -
sible.93 In future, market participants could like -
wise consider using the €STR or €STR- based 
term rates as a direct alternative to EURIBOR 
for certain instruments or contracts.Introduction 
of the €STR 
means sweeping 
changes for 
use of 
benchmarks , …ations.24 The discontinuation of existing ref-
erence rates, such as EONIA and LIBOR, will 
necessitate adjustments to the Eurosystem’s 
collateral framework for monetary policy 
operations, too. In addition to the fi  rst 
SONIA- based loans, pilot projects for RFR- 
based loans in other LIBOR currencies have 
already been launched or are being 
planned.25  At the same time, however, sub-
stantial new LIBOR exposures with matur-
ities beyond 2021 are still being built up in 
many areas.
As in all other countries in which LIBOR is 
used, market   participants in the euro area 
will have to prepare for   the discontinuation 
of the rates and   the use of the respective 
RFRs or new RFR- based products. Germany 
will be no exception. The signifi  cant banks 
in Germany (i.e. those that are supervised 
by the Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM) 
have substantial LIBOR exposures, in par-ticular for USD LIBOR and, to a lesser ex-
tent, GBP LIBOR.
24 As of October 2020, the Bank of England will 
already  begin gradually increasing haircut add- ons and 
will no longer accept collateral referencing LIBOR 
issued  on or after that date (see Bank of England 
(2020b)).
25 See, for example, Fannie Mae (2019), Freddie Mac 
(2019), RBS (2019), Shell (2019) or UBS (2019). In the 
United States, the government- sponsored enterprises 
that fi  nance  mortgages, Fannie Mae and Freddie  Mac, 
will no longer accept adjustable-rate mortgages refer-
encing LIBOR as of 2021 (see FHFA (2020)).
91 See ARRC (2020b) and FSB (2019b). The first cross-  
currency swaps referencing RFRs have already been traded 
(see ARRC (2020c)).
92 See, for example, EIB (2019) and KfW (2019).

The aforementioned work to be done is exten -
sive and time- consuming and its effects varied. 
For example, the steps that need to be taken 
by market participants include offering new 
products, preparing for their use and actively 
contributing to establishing liquid markets. 
Additionally, it will be necessary to amend or 
redraft contracts and to review and adapt exist -
ing processes, models and IT systems. Within 
the scope of implementing changes to con -
tracts and valuation parameters, the potential 
implications of commercial law also need to be 
explored and, if necessary, taken into account. 
In this context, careful, extensive preparation 
and rapid implementation of these changes are 
key. This will contribute to an orderly transition 
and will ultimately support the functioning and 
resilience of the financial system. Furthermore, 
market participants need to prepare for the dis -
continuation of LIBOR after 2021. This also 
means that market participants in Germany 
and the euro area are making arrangements to 
use the relevant RFR (or RFR- based backward-  
looking compounded term rates) as the default 
rate in their foreign currency operations in fu -
ture. As the various RFRs differ in terms of their 
design and IBORs will continue to be available 
in some currency areas, market participants 
will, going forward, be operating in an inter -
national environment in which a variety of 
benchmark rates with differing features coex -
ist. Supervisory authorities will monitor the pro -
gress made during the transition period. For 
example, the CEOs of institutions supervised 
under the SSM have already been asked to pro -
vide an initial overview of their preparedness 
with respect to changes to be implemented in 
connection with EONIA, EURIBOR and LIBOR.94
Given the complexity of the topic and the large 
number of stakeholders involved, transparency 
and targeted communication are essential. It is 
important to bear in mind here that the level of 
information of each group of stakeholders 
varies  greatly. To make the transition as smooth 
as possible, comprehensive and target group-  specific information is needed – not least for 
market participants outside the financial sector.
The necessary reform processes require dia -
logue and cooperation between the public and 
private sector. Central banks are playing a key 
supporting role in this regard. The Eurosystem 
is making a fundamental contribution, with the 
ECB providing the euro risk- free rate in the 
form of the €STR and facilitating private sector 
efforts by supporting the private sector’s work -
ing group on euro risk- free rates. As a member 
of the FSB OSSG, it is also involved in inter -
national coordination at the public sector level. 
As part of the Eurosystem, the Bundesbank 
contributes to the production of the €STR and 
liaises with market participants in Germany. 
Furthermore, it is the public sector’s task to 
look into potential regulatory hurdles in con -
nection with the reform processes and to ad -
dress any interpretation issues.95 At the same 
time, it is the responsibility of market partici -
pants as the key users of benchmarks to de -
velop and implement appropriate transitional 
arrangements and solutions, both as part of 
market initiatives and individually, which meet 
their needs and requirements while taking ac -
count of the framework conditions with which 
they have to comply. Going forward, too, it is 
therefore important to strike the right balance 
between private sector responsibility and public 
sector support.… which will 
require careful 
preparation and 
rapid implemen -
tation in order 
to contribute to 
a more robust 
financial system

information and 
communication

94 See ECB (2019i). In Germany, BaFin and the Bundes -
bank have similarly contacted selected institutions domi -
ciled in Germany that do not fall under the scope of the 
SSM. Supervisory authorities outside the euro area have 
also sent “Dear CEO” letters (see FCA and PRA (2018, 
2020) and FCA (2020b)).
95 See FSB (2019b). For various issues which, according to 
the private sector, require clarification by the public sector,
