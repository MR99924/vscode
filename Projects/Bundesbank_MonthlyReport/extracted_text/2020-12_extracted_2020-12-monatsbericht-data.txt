Economic conditions
Underlying trends
In the fourth quarter of 2020, the economic 
situation in Germany is being shaped by the re -
cent significant acceleration in infection rates. 
The additional containment measures in place 
from the beginning of November are interrupt -
ing the economic recovery and are likely to 
lead to a setback. The decline in gross domestic 
product is likely to be relatively slight in the 
final quarter of the year, however, and by no 
means on a similar scale as in the second quar -
ter.1 This is mainly due to the fact that the 
measures are now much more narrowly de -
fined and are concentrated on particularly 
contact- intensive services. As the recovery in 
global trade is relatively robust, the manufac -
turing sector, which got off to a strong start in 
the fourth quarter, is likely to provide support. 
The ifo Institute’s surveys show that, despite 
the partial lockdown, manufacturing firms even 
rated their business situation in November 
more positively than in October although they 
downgraded their business expectations. By 
contrast, sentiment in the economic sectors 
directly affected by containment measures de -
teriorated dramatically in November. In the 
hotel and restaurant sector, for example, it was 
roughly as negative as in April. A sharp decline 
in business can be expected in these areas. 
Moreover, according to the GfK survey, con -
sumer sentiment has also shown a marked de -
terioration recently.
Industry
Industrial output continued to climb steeply in 
October 2020. Compared with September, it 
rose by 3¼% in seasonally adjusted terms, ex -
ceeding the average of the third quarter by 
5%. Industrial output was thus still down by 
4¼% on the pre- crisis level in the fourth quar -ter of 2019. With an increase of one- eighth, 
output in the automotive sector showed par -
ticularly sharp growth compared with the third 
quarter. This trend is likely to have continued 
beyond October. According to the German As -
sociation of the Automotive Industry, the num -
ber of passenger cars manufactured in Novem -
ber rose again by just over one- tenth in season -
ally adjusted terms. On an average of October 
and November, the number of units produced 
was one- fifth higher than in the third quarter 
and pre- crisis levels were attained again in No -
vember. Driven by the automotive sector, cap -
ital goods production expanded substantially in 
October compared with the third quarter 
(+6¼%). While output of intermediate goods 
showed the same strong increase, consumer 
goods output fell slightly (-¾%). Despite the 
steep rise, the capital goods sector is still well 
below its pre- crisis level (-7¼%). By compari -
son, consumer goods and, in particular, inter -
mediate goods saw only a slight decline in out -
put (-2¾% and -1% respectively).
New orders in German industry have been re -
covering steadily since the low point in April. In 
October, demand for German industrial prod -
ucts rose for the sixth time in a row in season -
ally adjusted terms (+3% compared with Sep -
tember). This means that new orders were 
again markedly above the pre- crisis level of the 
final quarter of 2019. New orders were signifi -
cantly higher than the level recorded before the 
crisis in the case of intermediate goods (+4½%) 
and capital goods (+2¾%), but new orders of 
consumer goods were slightly down on their 
pre- crisis levels again in October (-¾%). Look -

sis period, demand for motor vehicles stands Economic recov -

ened significantly in December – as was being discussed at 
the cut- off date for this report. Many sectors of the econ -
omy significantly reduce activity in the last days of Decem -
ber anyway. For further information on the macroeconomic

out in particular (+8¼%). Orders from Germany 
and abroad rose by roughly the same amount 
(+5¼%) compared with the third quarter. For -
eign demand was boosted mainly by new 
orders from non- euro area countries (+8%, 
euro area +1¼%).
In October, nominal industrial sales continued 
to increase sharply on the month in seasonally 
adjusted terms (+4%). As with output, inter -
mediate and capital goods, particularly in the 
automotive sector, outpaced consumer goods 
in terms of sales growth. Similar to the pattern 
in preceding months, export sales rose more 
strongly than sales to domestic customers com -
pared with the third quarter, with particularly 
sharp sales growth recorded outside the euro 
area. However, compared with pre- crisis levels, 
foreign sales are still down by roughly the same 
amount as domestic sales, as the slump in 
foreign   sales in the spring was significantly 
stronger. In October, exports remained on the 
more moderate recovery path embarked upon 
in July. Nominal exports of goods saw only a 
slight seasonally adjusted rise on the previous 
month (+¾%) but compared with the previous 
quarter the improvement was comparatively 
steep (+3¼%). Exports to non- euro area coun -
tries –  notably the United States, the United 
Kingdom and the newly industrialised countries 
in Asia – grew more strongly than those to the 
euro area. Nominal imports of goods increased 
more slowly than exports. In October, they rose 
only slightly on the month in seasonally ad -
justed terms (+¼%). The quarter- on- quarter 
growth was stronger (+2¼%). In comparison 
with pre- crisis times, the shortfall is as high as 
for exports (-6%) in nominal terms, but signifi -
cantly lower in real terms (-2%).
Construction
The coronavirus crisis is still having only a small 
impact on the German construction sector. 
Construction output rose sharply in October 
2020 compared with the slightly depressed 
third quarter (+3¾%) and thus also exceeded Industrial sales

the previous year’s level markedly. The finishing 
trades, where the data are typically prone to 
revision, have flourished in particular (+7%). 
New orders were up by 3% in the third quarter. 
Measured by the reach of the order books in 
the main construction sector as determined by 
ifo Institute surveys in November, the order 
situation can still be classified as very good. 
Equipment utilisation also remained well above 
its long- term average in November according 
to the ifo Institute.
Labour market
According to the available data, the renewed 
tightening of measures to contain the pan -
demic in November 2020 have so far not led to 
any strong reactions in the labour market. 
Compared with just under 150,000 in October, 
notifications of short- time working were filed 
for just over half a million employees between 
1 and 25  November, which is nowhere near 
the figures from March or April, however. This 
is due, in part, to the fact that business closures 
were ordered in fewer sectors and that the no -
tifications were mainly concentrated on the 
hotel and restaurant sector. According to the 
provisional figures of the Federal Employment 
Agency, the number of short- time workers fell 
to 2.2 million by September, which was slightly 
more than one- third of April’s peak figure.
Despite the stricter lockdown measures, regis -
tered unemployment continued October’s 
positive development in November. The official 
unemployment figure was 39,000 lower than 
in the previous month after seasonal adjust -
ment and the unemployment rate fell by 
0.1 percentage point to 6.1%. For the first time 
since the start of the pandemic, unemployment 
in both October and November fell more 
sharply in the category of SGB III job seekers 
(those receiving unemployment benefits under 
the statutory unemployment insurance 
scheme), which is more closely related to eco -
nomic activity than unemployment under cat -
egory SGB II, where persons receive basic social benefits. Active labour market policy measures 
did not have any discernible impact on the 
change in unemployment.
Data on employment are available up to Octo -
ber and reflect the slight recovery process be -
fore the tighter contact restrictions came into 
force. Compared with the previous month, 
total employment increased by 20,000 persons 
in seasonally adjusted terms. Self- employment 
continued to decrease, in line with the trend 
that has been evident for some time now. By 
contrast, there was a slight rise in the number 
of employees. The leading employment indica -
tors did not deteriorate even under the rules in 
force since the beginning of November, which 
means that a significant decline in employment 
is unlikely in the short term.
Prices
Crude oil prices rose markedly in November 
2020, as the global economic outlook for the 
medium term brightened on the back of posi -
tive news on vaccination research. Compared 
with October, they were up by almost 7% on 
average, but were still 30% below their previ -
ous year’s level. Prices continued their upward 
trend in the first two weeks of December. As 
this report went to press, the price of a barrel 
of Brent crude oil stood at US$50. Crude oil 
futures were trading at slight discounts. The 
discount on crude oil futures was US$½ for de -
liveries six months ahead and US$1¼ for deliv -
eries 12 months ahead.
Energy prices drove import prices distinctly 
higher in October overall. By contrast, other 
goods cost the same as a month earlier. Do -
mestic industrial sales prices were also up 
slightly. This was attributable in equal parts to 
energy and other goods. Compared with the 
previous year, however, prices at the import 
level were 3.9% lower and domestic industrial 
sales prices dropped by 0.7%. Price dynamics 
at the upstream stages of consumer prices had 
been similar in the preceding months.In November,

Consumer prices (HICP) overall remained un -
changed in November in seasonally adjusted 
terms, as in the previous month. Energy prices 
fell markedly despite higher oil prices. Food 
prices rose slightly overall, although tobacco 
products, which are classified as food, became 
significantly cheaper. By contrast, prices of in -
dustrial goods excluding energy remained con -
stant. Services were more expensive than in the 
previous month. However, the meaningfulness 
of this figure is likely to be limited because the 
measures to contain the spread of the virus 
mean that there is a lack of price representa -
tives. This mainly concerns recreation activities 
such as travel.2 Headline HICP inflation was 
down by 0.7% on the year, after coming down 
by 0.5% in October.3 The rate fell from +0.1% 
to -0.1% when excluding energy and food. Set -
ting aside travel services and clothing, whose 
prices normally fluctuate sharply, the rate re -
mained slightly positive at just over ¼%. At the 
turn of the year, headline HICP inflation and 
HICP inflation excluding energy and food 
should also be visibly up on the year. VAT rates 
will then be raised again, which is likely to have 
a similar effect on consumer prices as when 
they were lowered in July. Furthermore, the 
introduction of CO 2 emission permits is likely to 
make mineral oil products and gas perceptibly 
more expensive.
Public finances4
Statutory health insurance 
scheme
The statutory health insurance (SHI) scheme 
(comprising the health insurance institutions 
and the health fund) recorded a deficit of €1 
billion in the third quarter of 2020. This repre -
sented a deterioration of €½ billion compared 
with the previous year. The statutory health in -
surance institutions and the health fund de -
veloped in very different ways.
Health insurance institutions posted a deficit of 
€3 billion. This was almost €3 billion higher than in the previous year. Overall, institutions’ 
expenditure rose by 8%, although this figure 
appears to be based to a large extent on esti -
mates. More favourable outturns might emerge 
over the following quarters. Revenue rose by 
3½%. Health insurance institutions’ reserves 
fell to just under €18 billion by the end of Sep -
tember.
Following a fall in coronavirus infection rates in 
the third quarter, the utilisation of regular ser -
vices was back up to significantly higher levels 
than those recorded in the second quarter. In 
addition, many benefits were expanded, not 
least owing to the coronavirus pandemic, in -
cluding in the area of long- term care. Individual 
expenditure items developed as follows.
– Spending on hospital treatment, a particu -
larly large expenditure item, grew by 9½% 
in the third quarter. Looking at January to 
September in aggregate, it was thus almost 
1½% up on the corresponding prior- year 
figure. This does not include financial com -
pensation for keeping capacity free for the 
treatment of COVID-  19 patients. These cen -
tral government payments are routed by the 
health fund to the respective hospitals via 
the state governments. Including these pay -
ments, hospitals received 16½% more funds 
in the first three quarters than in the same 
period of the previous year.
– As usual, health insurance institutions had to 
estimate expenditure on outpatient medical 
treatment as almost no accounting data 
were available for the reporting period. The 
health insurance institutions posted a very 
strong increase of just under 13½%, al -Consumer prices

4 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain an in- depth description of 
public finance developments during the preceding quarter.

debt, see the statistical section of this report.Deutsche Bundesbank

though estimates are currently likely to be 
even more uncertain than usual. This also 
applies, for example, to spending on corona -
virus tests.
– By contrast, the strong growth in spending 
on pharmaceuticals tailed off considerably in 
the third quarter, eased by the VAT cut in 
mid- 2020.
– The institutions’ finances were also strained 
by a number of health insurance institutions 
expanding their pension provisions very 
sharply.
The health fund recorded a clear surplus of €2 
billion (following a deficit of €½ billion in the 
previous year). Without a special central gov -
ernment grant of €3½ billion, it would have 
posted a deficit. Employees’ contributions rose 
by 1½%, buoyed by contributions payable on 
short- time working benefits. By comparison, 
contributions payable on unemployment bene -
fits climbed significantly more strongly. Contri -
butions payable on pensions grew fairly ro -
bustly, unaffected by the pandemic. Overall, 
contribution receipts were up by 3%. The 
fund’s expenditure normally consists almost ex -
clusively of transfers to the health insurance in -
stitutions. These rose by 4%, as planned. This 
figure does not yet include pandemic- related 
financial assistance granted to providers of 
therapeutic treatment and investment grants 
for intensive care beds (totalling almost €½ bil -
lion). In addition – as described above – the 
health fund routed central government pay -
ments of €3 billion to hospitals via the state 
governments (with a neutral effect on the bal -
ance).
In the first three quarters taken together, the 
SHI scheme’s deficit increased by €3 billion on 
the year to just under €7 billion. Despite the 
pandemic, a final- quarter surplus is likely to be 
recorded as usual. Nevertheless, a substantial 
deficit is also expected for the year as a whole 
(following a deficit of €1 billion in 2019 accord -
ing to the annual accounts). For the health in -surance institutions, it could roughly match the 
previous year’s level (just under €2 billion). For 
the health fund, it is likely to (somewhat) ex -
ceed the deficit of €2 billion expected before 
the pandemic. On balance, this would mean 
the SHI scheme would close only marginally 
worse off than had been expected before the 
outbreak of the coronavirus crisis. This is pri -
marily on account of extensive central govern -
ment funds, which are broadly offsetting the 
additional burdens.
For the coming year, the group of SHI estimators 
expects the health fund’s deficit to shrink to €1 
billion. Although contribution receipts (+2½% Health fund in

compared with 2020 if the contribution rate re -
mains unchanged) are passed on to the health 
insurance institutions with a neutral effect on 
the balance, €0.9 billion is being channelled 
from the liquidity reserve to the health insurance 
institutions in order to broadly compensate 
them for the reduction in SHI contributions pay -
able on occupational pensions since the begin -
ning of 2020. In addition, transfers are to be 
made to the Innovation and Structural Funds.
Besides the expansion in benefits over the past 
few years, the catching-  up of postponed pro -
cedures from 2020 could weigh on health in -
surance institutions. The Federal Ministry of 
Health expects the health insurance institu -
tions’ expenditure to rise steeply by 6½%.5 If 
average supplementary contribution rates re -
main unchanged, the health insurance institu -
tions would be faced with a large financial 
shortfall of €18 billion – the same amount as 
total reserves currently available. However, as 
reserves may not be earmarked in their entirety 
and as they are also unevenly distributed 
among the health insurance institutions, dis -
tinct contribution rate increases would be ex -
pected. €18 billion, taken in isolation, would be 
the equivalent of revenue amounting to around 
1.2 percentage points of the contribution rate.
The Federal Government is aiming to widely 
limit the increase in supplementary contribu -
tion rates and is therefore providing an add -
itional central government grant of €5 billion. It 
also assumes that the health insurance institu -
tions will withdraw a total of €8 billion from 
their reserves in order to cover their expend -
iture. To support this, the health fund is to shift 
part of its transfers from health insurance insti -
tutions with higher reserves to those with 
lower reserves on a one- off basis. In addition, 
the upper limit on reserves is being lowered 
from 1.0 to 0.8 times the scheme’s monthly ex -
penditure. After deducting the special central 
government grant and the assumed reserve 
withdrawals, the health insurance institutions’ 
arithmetical financial shortfall will shrink to 
around €5 billion given the current average supplementary contribution rate. The arithmet -
ical supplementary contribution rate for 2021 
set by the Federal Ministry of Health will rise 
accordingly by 0.3 percentage point compared 
with the average rate for 2020 to 1.3%. Each 
health insurance institution may decide for it -
self whether to adjust its own supplementary 
contribution rate. However, health insurance 
institutions with reserves above the lowered 
upper limit are not permitted to raise their sup -
plementary contribution rates. Furthermore, 
the efforts of many health insurance institu -
tions to hold higher reserves are set to be 
curbed by the cuts in transfers.
Overall, the increase in supplementary contri -
bution rates is likely to remain limited on aver -
age. The institutions’ deficit (total reserve with -
drawals) will rise significantly. A large deficit is 
therefore expected in the SHI scheme for 2021. 
Given the dependence on the further course of 
the pandemic and macroeconomic develop -
ments, uncertainty remains very high.
Public long- term care 
 insurance scheme
The public long- term care insurance scheme 
posted a surplus of €1 billion in the core area in 
the third quarter of 2020.6 In the previous year, 
the surplus stood at €½ billion. This improve -
ment is chiefly attributable to the fact that the

5 There was no consensus among the estimators with re -
gard to estimating expenditure. The health insurance insti -
tutions expect their expenditure to rise by 7%. The discrep -
ancy in the expenditure levels amounts to €1½ billion and 
corresponds to revenue equivalent to one- tenth of a per -
centage point of the contribution rate.
6 The developments outlined here and in the remainder of 
the text exclude the provident fund. This fund uses trans -
fers financed by contributions from the core area to accu -
mulate assets. These assets are to be depleted again in the 
2030s to dampen the expected contribution rate rise. At 
the end of the third quarter of 2020, the accumulated re -
serves stood at just over €7½ billion.Deutsche Bundesbank

Total revenue grew by 18½% on the year. Ex -
cluding the additional central government 
funds, the increase still stands at 3½%. The 
somewhat lower employees’ contributions 
were offset by significantly higher contributions 
payable on unemployment benefits and pen -
sions. Expenditure rose very steeply by 15½%. 
Cash benefits were up by 10½%, largely owing 
to an increase in the number of benefit recipi -
ents. Spending on non- cash benefits, a very 
large expenditure item, rose by 19%. This was 
mainly due to extraordinary pandemic- related 
expenditure on outpatient, day- patient and full 
inpatient facilities.7 In addition, most of the 
coronavirus bonus for nursing staff was paid 
out in the third quarter. Overall, extraordinary 
pandemic- related expenditure amounted to al -
most €1½ billion. By contrast, regular expend -
iture on full inpatient care fell slightly. Adjusted 
for extraordinary pandemic- related expend -
iture, spending on benefits rose by 4%.
After the first three quarters, the long- term 
care insurance scheme recorded a surplus of 
€1½ billion (previous year: +€2 billion). A sig -
nificant surplus is also expected for the year as 
a whole, although this is likely to be markedly 
lower than in the previous year (2019: just over 
€3 billion according to final accounting fig -
ures). This still relatively favourable develop -
ment is driven by the fact that central govern -
ment essentially shielded the long- term care 
insurance scheme from the additional demands 
stemming from the coronavirus.
Contribution receipts will probably continue to 
grow moderately next year. However, owing to 
the rule- based raising of benefit rates, expend -
iture is expected to grow robustly. The financial 
result is therefore likely to deteriorate sharply 
and turn into a deficit. It will still be possible, 
initially, to cover this using the relatively high 
general reserves (end- 2019: €7 billion). How -
ever, funding pressure is unlikely to ease going 
forward, with contribution rate increases likely 
on account of demographic changes.Securities markets

(€179.8 billion). After deducting the higher re -
demptions and taking account of changes in 
issuers’ holdings of their own debt securities, 
net redemptions of domestic debt securities 
amounted to €18.0 billion. The outstanding 
volume of foreign debt securities in Germany 
rose by €21.3 billion during the reporting 
month, boosting the outstanding volume of 
debt instruments in the German market by 
€3.3 billion overall.
Domestic enterprises raised their capital market 
debt only marginally in October, by €2.0 billion 
(previous month: €23.7 billion). The vast major -
ity of issuances were attributable to non-  
financial corporations; on balance, all had ma -
turities of more than one year.
In the reporting month, the public sector re -
deemed debt securities worth €3.7 billion net 
(following net issuance of €19.2 billion in Sep -
tember). Ultimately, this was solely attributable 
to central government, which reduced its cap -ital market debt by €6.0 billion. It mainly re -
deemed five- year Federal notes (Bobls, €21.2 
billion) and – to a lesser extent – Treasury dis -
count paper (Bubills, €2.6 billion). This con -
trasted with net issuance of two- year Federal 
treasury notes (Schätze, €5.0 billion) and Fed -
eral bonds with maturities of 7 to 30 years 
(Bunds, €9.0 billion in total). State and local 
governments issued their own bonds worth 
€2.3 billion net.
Domestic credit institutions reduced their cap -
ital market debt by €16.3 billion in October 
(following net issuance of €23.5 billion in Sep -
tember). In particular, there was a fall in the 
outstanding volume of debt securities issued by 
specialised credit institutions (€10.2 billion) and 
in the outstanding volume of other bank debt 
securities (€4.5 billion). Moreover, there were 
net redemptions of mortgage Pfandbriefe and 
public Pfandbriefe (€0.9 billion and €0.6 billion, 
respectively).
The Bundesbank was the main buyer on bal -
ance, adding a net €24.5 billion worth of bonds 
–  primarily acquired under the Eurosystem’s 
asset purchase programmes – to its portfolio, 
the vast majority of which were domestic 
bonds issued by the public sector. On balance, 
domestic non- banks and credit institutions ex -
panded their bond portfolios by €16.0 billion 
and €9.2 billion, respectively. In both instances, 
buyers’ interest was chiefly focused on foreign 
paper. By contrast, non- resident investors re -
duced their holdings of German debt securities 
by €46.4 billion net. On balance, they primarily 
sold bonds issued by private issuers.
Equity market
In October 2020, domestic enterprises issued 
€1.1 billion worth of new shares in the German 
equity market, compared with €20.7 billion in 
the previous month. The volume of foreign 
equities in the German market rose by €4.0 bil -

folios by €0.3 billion in net terms.
Mutual funds
Domestic mutual funds recorded net inflows of 
€11.7 billion in October 2020 (compared with 
€10.1 billion in September). On balance, spe -
cialised funds reserved for institutional invest -
ors were virtually the sole beneficiaries of such 
inflows (€11.0 billion). Among the fund pro -
viders, the main sellers of new shares were 
mixed securities- based funds (€6.7 billion), fol -
lowed to a lesser extent by equity funds (€1.9 
billion) and open- end real estate funds (€1.4 
billion). The outstanding volume of foreign 
mutual   fund shares distributed in Germany in -
creased by €3.7 billion during the month under 
review. In October, mutual fund shares were 
purchased almost exclusively by domestic non- 
banks (€14.9 billion). Domestic credit institu -
tions purchased mutual fund shares worth €0.9 
billion net. By contrast, foreign investors off -
loaded German mutual fund shares for €0.4 
billion net.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €22.5 billion in October 2020, down €2.7 
billion from the previous month’s level. This 
was chiefly attributable to a fall in the goods 
account surplus. The surplus in invisible current 
transactions, which comprise services as well as 
primary and secondary income, decreased only 
slightly.
In October, the surplus in the goods account 
declined by €2.6 billion on the month to €20.0 
billion, with imports of goods recording a 
sharper increase than exports.
At €2.5 billion, the surplus in invisible current 
transactions in October was slightly down on

billion to stand at €4.3 billion. Receipts fell, 
mainly owing to lower government revenue 
from current taxes on income and wealth. In 
addition, expenditure rose slightly, especially 
due to higher payments to the EU budget in 
connection with financing related to gross na -
tional income. In the services account, the def -
icit narrowed by €0.7 billion to €0.2 billion. 
This was attributable to a slight increase in re -
ceipts, chiefly as a result of higher receipts from 
financial services and other business services. 
Expenditure remained slightly below the previ -
ous month’s figure, with the pandemic- related 
decline in travel expenditure having had a sig -
nificant dampening effect. Net receipts on pri -
mary income went up slightly by €0.3 billion to 
€7.1 billion.
In October 2020, international capital markets 
recorded rising yield spreads in favour of US in -
vestments in the run- up to the US presidential 
elections. In addition, there were signs of a 
second wave of the COVID-  19 pandemic in 
Europe, although it had not yet had an impact 
on real economic activity. It was against this 
backdrop that Germany’s cross- border port -
folio investment recorded net capital exports of 
€76.3 billion (following net capital imports of 
€34.5 billion in September). The main reason 
for this reversal was non- resident investors dis -
posing of German securities worth €47.0 billion 
net. This was chiefly attributable to a one- off 
effect, which resulted in non- residents return -
ing large volumes of private (primarily corpor -
ate) bonds (€20.4 billion). On top of this, they 
also sold public bonds (€14.2 billion), money 
market paper (€11.7 billion) as well as a small 
volume of mutual fund shares (€0.4 billion) and 
shares (€0.3 billion). Conversely, domestic 
 investors acquired foreign securities worth 
€29.3 billion. They bought (primarily euro-  
denominated) bonds (€17.4 billion), shares 
(€4.3 billion), money market paper (€3.9 bil -
lion) and mutual fund shares (€3.7 billion).Financial derivatives recorded net capital ex -
ports of €0.8 billion in October (September: 
€5.6 billion).
Direct investment posted net capital exports of 
€2.9 billion in the reporting month (following 
inflows totalling €3.3 billion in September). Do -
mestic enterprises increased their foreign direct 
investment by €12.5 billion. They boosted their 
equity capital in non- resident subsidiaries by 
€3.2 billion, almost entirely through reinvested 
earnings. In addition, they granted, on balance, 
€9.3 billion in loans to affiliated enterprises 
abroad. Foreign direct investment stocks in 
Germany rose by €9.7 billion as a result of 
transactions. Foreign enterprises supplied their 
subsidiaries in Germany with €4.0 billion of 
equity capital and provided €5.6 billion on bal -
ance via intra- group lending.
Other statistically recorded investment – which 
comprises loans and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank de -
posits and other investments – registered net 
inflows amounting to €52.0 billion in October 
(following outflows totalling €51.7 billion in 
September). The banking system alone recorded 
net inflows of €50.7 billion. The Bundesbank’s 
net capital imports accounted for €39.8 billion 
of this amount, which was attributable to the 
€67.9 billion decrease in the TARGET2 balance. 
At the same time, however, deposits from non-  
resident counterparties also decreased. On bal -
ance, a further €10.9 billion flowed to monetary 
financial institutions (excluding the Bundes -
bank). Transactions by enterprises and house -
holds in other investment resulted in net capital 
imports of €3.4 billion. In this position, the gov -
ernment closed as the only sector with net cap -
ital exports (€2.2 billion).

Outlook for the German economy 
for 2021 to 2023
The outlook for the German economy is still being shaped by the COVID-  19 pandemic. In the third 
quarter, a large portion of the prior losses in activity were recouped. However, in the final quarter 
of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, the German economy will probably experience a limited 
setback because of the pandemic’s resurgence. Subsequently, though, it is likely to resume its 
strong growth. This is based on the assumption that the pandemic containment measures will be 
quickly loosened from spring 2021 in the wake of medical advances, and ultimately expire 
altogether in the early months of 2022. As a result, consumption opportunities previously made 
impossible by the pandemic will open up again and be utilised, and the current exceptionally 
high level of saving will fall sharply. Consequently, the economic recovery will be driven primarily 
by private consumption.
In this scenario, which is considered the most likely, real gross domestic product (GDP) will see a 
strong calendar- adjusted rise of 3% in 2021 and 4½% in 2022, following a decline of 5½% this 
year. In 2023, the rate of GDP growth will then approach that of potential growth. Real GDP will 
return to its pre- crisis level at the beginning of 2022, and potential output will follow suit only a 
little later.
Consumer price inflation will decline significantly to 0.4% this year, primarily because of the tem -
porary cut in VAT rates and the collapse in crude oil prices. In 2021, both the reversal of the VAT 
cut and the introduction of CO 2 emission certificates will drive up prices. After adjustment for the 
VAT effect, core inflation excluding energy and food will probably be somewhat higher than 1% 
in both years. The dampening impact of weak macroeconomic demand will outweigh the price- 
boosting supply- side effects of the pandemic. Subsequently, as growth in wages becomes stronger 
again and profit margins recover along with demand for goods, these factors will increase price 
pressures. In 2023, inflation could reach just over 1½%.
Public finances are playing a substantial role in stabilising the economy as a whole. As a result, 
the general government deficit will probably reach around 5% of GDP this year, and the Maas -
tricht debt ratio will rise to approximately 70%. Public finances will subsequently improve as the 
economy recovers and the pandemic support measures come to an end.
The economic outlook is highly uncertain, particularly with regard to the pandemic and its eco -
nomic impact. For this reason, the projections cover two scenarios for how the pandemic will 
unfold: a milder and a more severe scenario. In the first scenario, the economy will see a signifi -
cantly faster and stronger recovery. In the second, by contrast, GDP will not reach its pre-  crisis 
level until the end of 2023, with potential output taking a substantial hit. The rate of inflation will 
then be perceptibly lower. All in all, the risks – also looking beyond the pandemic – both to eco -
nomic growth and inflation appear roughly balanced as things currently stand.Deutsche Bundesbank

Economic outlook1
The German economy’s current situation and 
short- term outlook hinge on the COVID-  19 
pandemic. The pandemic triggered an unpre -
cedented slump in economic activity in the 
second quarter of 2020. Contact- intensive ser -
vices whose business operations were substan -
tially restricted or completely halted by 
government- imposed containment measures 
and voluntary behavioural adjustments took a 
particularly hard hit. This restriction of con -
sumption opportunities due to the pandemic 
made the saving ratio soar and placed a very 
substantial strain on private consumption in the first half of 2020. Exports saw an even sharper 
fall, primarily because of the collapse in foreign 
demand due to the pandemic. This – and the 
high degree of uncertainty over the economic 
outlook  – caused enterprises’ investment in 
machinery and equipment to plunge. As ex -
pected in the June projection, real GDP in the 
second quarter of 2020 was, overall and after 
seasonal and calendar adjustment, 11½% 
below the figure recorded for the final quarter 
of 2019.2 As infections decreased and contain -
ment measures were eased, the economy saw 
a strong recovery in the third quarter of the 
year, driven by rebound effects and, to some 
extent, catch- up effects in the sectors previ -
ously hit by a major slump. Nonetheless, eco -
nomic output was still 4% below its pre-  crisis 
level, with substantial variation among the dif -
ferent economic sectors. The countermove -
ment in the summer, which was much stronger 
than expected, was bolstered by fiscal and 
monetary policy support measures, which were 
not yet included in the June projection.
In the final quarter of 2020 and the first quarter 
of 2021, the economic recovery is likely to be 
interrupted. The autumn resurgence of the 
pandemic in Germany and many of its key trad -
ing partner countries could cause economic 
output to decline again –  albeit moderately 
compared with the spring – by an approximate 
figure of just under 1%. This is based on the 
assumption that containment measures will re -
main necessary in the first quarter of 2021, 
with a similar average negative impact on the 
economy as in the fourth quarter of 2020.3 
However, the economy is not likely to take a hit 
like that in the second quarter of 2020, nor is 
GDP expected to fall to such a low level. At In Q3, German

3 A further temporary tightening of the measures could 
potentially allow easing at a somewhat earlier stage. Pro -
vided economic activity is not restricted on a broad scale 
and for a long period of time, the impact on the average 
level of GDP relative to the baseline scenario will therefore 
probably remain relatively small.Deutsche Bundesbank

present, significantly fewer sectors face such 
tight restrictions as in the spring. It is primarily 
contact- intensive segments that are being af -
fected directly by the restrictions. In addition, 
the experience now gained in dealing with the 
pandemic is mitigating the adverse economic 
impact of the measures. Demand from abroad 
is also likely to remain more stable. As a result, 
losses in sectors of the economy not directly 
affected by restrictions, such as industry, should 
remain limited. This assessment is also reflected 
in business sentiment. In November, enterprises 
in the services sector (excluding trade) assessed 
their business situation as having markedly 
worsened, whereas industrial enterprises once 
again considered their situation to have signifi -
cantly improved. Business expectations deteri -
orated somewhat towards the end of the 
period under review but remained far above 
the lows recorded in the second quarter of 
2020.4
Later in the projection horizon, the German 
economy is likely to return to the path of recov -
ery that was interrupted in the final quarter of 
2020 and the first quarter of 2021, and to grow 
strongly for some time. In the baseline scen -
ario, it is assumed that the containment meas -
ures can be quickly loosened from spring 2021 
and will expire altogether in the early months 
of 2022. In addition to greater opportunities 
for outdoor activities in the second and third 
quarters of 2021, medical advances in combat -
ing the pandemic – most notably, widely avail -
able vaccines – will play a crucial role in this.
All in all, in the baseline scenario, this points to 
a strong, temporarily interrupted recovery for 
the German economy, manifesting itself in a 
growth path close to that of potential output. 
Following the sharp decline of 5½% this year, 
real GDP could grow at strong calendar-adjusted

This is mainly because the recovery both in Ger -
many and abroad was significantly stronger 
than expected in the third quarter of 2020.
In the baseline scenario, the pandemic will 
have only relatively little impact on potential 
output, partly thanks to the extensive monet -
ary, fiscal and labour market policy support 
measures.6 Compared with the assessment be -
fore the outbreak of the pandemic, potential 
output for 2023 is now estimated to be just 
over 1% lower. It should be noted, however, 
that the containment measures will be a tem -
porary roadblock to exploiting this potential in 
full in 2020 and 2021 on the supply side as 
well. As the German economy continues its re -
covery, it will approach its potential output 
thanks to a renewed rise in demand and the 
elimination of supply constraints, and capacity 
utilisation is likely to shift into the normal range 
from 2022 onwards.
Irrespective of the resurgence of the pandemic 
in many countries, German exports are likely to 
be a key pillar of economic activity in the final 
quarter of 2020. To some extent, this momen -
tum will be supported by anticipatory effects 
created by the United Kingdom’s withdrawal 
from the EU single market and the customs 
union with effect from 1  January 2021. Al -
though services in particular are suffering under 
the newly imposed containment measures, in -
cluding in other European countries, demand 
for goods from Germany’s export range will 
probably also be affected. Enterprises’ export 
expectations have fallen significantly of late. 
For this reason, and on account of the burden -
ing effect Brexit will then have, exports are 
likely to temporarily decline somewhat at the 
beginning of 2021. Upon the resumption of the 
economic upturn in key partner countries, ex -
ports should rapidly gain pace from the second 
quarter of 2021 onwards and be a solid pillar of 
economic recovery. However, it is assumed that Only compara -

Underlying conditions for macroeconomic projections
This projection is based on assumptions 
made by Eurosystem experts about the 
global economy, exchange rates, commod-
ity prices and interest rates. They are based 
on information available as at 18 November 
2020. The assumptions regarding economic 
activity in the euro area are derived from 
projections made by the national central 
banks of the euro area countries.1 These 
projections incorporate the fi  scal policy 
measures that have been either adopted or 
adequately specifi  ed and are deemed likely 
to be implemented.
With regard to the coronavirus pandemic, 
the baseline scenario assumes that the lat-
est reported advances in the development 
of a vaccine are confi  rmed and that a med-
ical response to the virus can be effectively 
implemented in most countries, including 
those of the euro area and Germany, over 
the projection horizon. Large- scale vaccin-
ations are likely to be carried out as early as 
2021. As a result, the containment meas-
ures, which will remain in place in the fi  nal 
quarter of 2020 and the fi  rst quarter of 
2021, may be relaxed rapidly from the 
second quarter of 2021 onwards and 
phased out altogether in the fi  rst few 
months of 2022.
Global economy recovering from deep 
recession
As expected in the June projection, global 
economic activity saw a historic decline in 
the second quarter of 2020. The recovery in 
global economic activity in the third quarter 
is likely to have been signifi  cantly stronger 
than assumed back then. However, the 
pace of growth is likely to weaken signifi  -
cantly in the fi  nal quarter of 2020 and the 
fi  rst quarter of 2021, partly owing to the re-
newed sharp rise in the number of infec-
tions worldwide in the autumn. Apart from 
China, where gross domestic product (GDP) 
fell sharply at the start of the year, but then, in the second quarter, already exceeded the 
pre- crisis level of the end of last year, eco-
nomic activity in almost all of the euro 
area’s  major trading partners is likely to 
remain  below the level reached before the 
coronavirus crisis began until at least the 
second half of 2021.
Irrespective of how the pandemic pro-
gresses, the outlook for the United King-
dom in particular will be infl  uenced by the 
form that trade relations with the European 
Union take once the transition period 
comes to an end. This projection assumes 
that no trade agreement will be reached by 
the end of the year, which means that the 
World Trade Organization’s “most favoured 
nation” rules will apply from 1  January 
2021.2
For the global economy as a whole exclud-
ing the euro area, an expansion rate of 
5¾% is forecast for the coming year, fol-
lowing a decline of 3% this year, before 
economic activity grows in 2022 and 2023 
at rates of 4% and 3½% respectively. A 
similar profi  le is assumed for international 
trade. Following a downturn of 9¼% this 
year, global trade (excluding the euro area) 
is expected to increase by 7% next year, be-
fore growing at rates of 4% in 2022 and 
3½% in 2023.
Recovery process in euro area 
determined  by course of pandemic
For the euro area, the slump in economic 
activity in the second quarter of 2020 was 
somewhat less dramatic than had been ex-
1 The projections made by the national central banks 
of the euro area countries were completed on 25 No-
vember 2020.
2 The previous projections had assumed the adoption 
of a trade agreement by the end of 2020. The assump-
tion that has now been made matches that of the 
European Commission in its latest forecast (see Euro-
pean Commission (2020)).Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

pected in the June projection. In addition, 
the recovery in the third quarter was 
stronger than forecast in June owing to the 
extensive easing of containment measures 
and the signifi  cant recovery in world trade. 
Following the sharp rise in the number of 
infections, the restrictions put in place to 
contain the pandemic were tightened again 
in the fourth quarter. Compared with the 
second quarter, the current containment 
measures focus more on restricting contact 
in private settings and in the areas of recre-
ation, restaurants and accommodation, as 
well as parts of the retail sector. This means 
that the services sector has once again been 
severely affected, whereas the impact on 
industry and construction is likely to have 
been only marginal. The measures taken are 
therefore likely to have a much less damp-
ening effect on economic activity in the 
fi  nal quarter of 2020 and the fi  rst quarter of 
2021 than in the second quarter. Given the 
general assumption of this projection that 
the pandemic will have been gradually 
overcome by medical solutions by the fi  rst 
quarter of 2022, containment measures 
could successively be eased over this period. 
A contraction of 8.1% is projected for the euro area (excluding Germany) this year. As 
a result of the signifi  cantly muted expect-
ations for the fi  nal quarter of 2020 and the 
fi  rst quarter of 2021, the growth rate for 
2021 is now set at 4.3%, which is lower 
than in the June forecast. For the following 
years, growth of 4.1% is expected in 2022 
and of 2.2% in 2023.
German exporters’ sales markets, which 
were hit somewhat harder this year than 
world trade, are likely to expand less dy-
namically than global trade next year. The 
changing trade relations with the United 
Kingdom will also play a part in this. In 
2022, the continued recovery of sales mar-
kets could slightly outpace that of world 
trade.
Scenarios illustrate high uncertainty 
about outlook for global setting
Given the high level of uncertainty about 
the global economic outlook on account of 
the pandemic, two alternative scenarios as 
to how the global economy might develop 
were constructed in addition to the base-
line scenario of the projection – as in the 
June projection. Assuming lower economic 
burdens in the milder scenario, global GDP 
and world trade could expand distinctly 
more dynamically as early as next year. By 
contrast, if it takes longer to implement 
medical solutions to combat the pandemic, 
the economic recovery process would be 
slowed down considerably over the next 
two years. In the more severe scenario, 
global trade will not reach its pre- crisis level 
until sometime in 2023.
Technical assumptions of the projection
The assumptions regarding crude oil prices 
derived from forward prices indicate only a 
slight rise over the next three years. The 
prices of other commodities on a US dollar 
basis recovered very strongly by the third 
quarter3 and are already perceptibly back

over their pre- crisis levels. They are ex-
pected to continue to rise over the next 
three years in line with the anticipated re-
covery in the global economy.
At its meeting in June, the ECB Governing 
Council decided to extend the pandemic 
emergency purchase programme (PEPP). 
One important reason for this was that the 
outlook for price stability had deteriorated 
in light of the pandemic. The overall envel-
ope of the programme was increased to 
€1,350 billion and the horizon for net pur-
chases was extended until at least the end 
of June 2021.4 The rise in excess liquidity 
has led to a further decline in interest rates 
in the money market in recent months. In-
creased demand for safe assets given the 
renewed uptick in the number of infections 
and the associated deterioration in the eco-
nomic outlook have also caused yields on 
ten- year Bunds to fall since June. Expect-
ations of a possible recalibration of the 
monetary policy stance are also likely to 
have played a role here.5 Market expect-
ations point to a rather moderate rise in 
yields over the projection horizon. In line 
with the technical interest rate assumptions 
and given the fi  nancial system’s ample li-
quidity levels, bank lending rates are also 
expected to go up only slightly over the 
projection horizon.6 Financing conditions 
thus remain extremely favourable.
Following the June projection, the euro ap-
preciated signifi  cantly against the US dollar; 
in the period used for deriving the exchange 
rate assumptions, it was trading at US$1.18, 
which was 9¼% higher than the assump-
tions in the June projection. Compared with 
42 currencies of major trading partners, the 
euro has appreciated by 3¾% since June.7
Fiscal measures provide support during 
coronavirus crisis
Extensive fi  scal measures were taken into 
consideration in the projection, accounting 
for 4% of GDP in the current year’s defi  cit. 
The vast majority of these were taken in re-sponse to the coronavirus crisis, and these 
measures will largely be phased out again in 
subsequent years. However, a number of 
other decisions will then weigh on the gov-
ernment budget.
The aim of fi  scal coronavirus measures is to 
support the healthcare system, enterprises 
and households and to stabilise the econ-
omy during the COVID- 19 crisis.8 They are

6 These forecasts are based on the assumption that 
the economic recovery process, together with the fi  s-
cal support measures adopted for the corporate sector 
and households – as well as the ample supply of liquid-
ity to the markets – will ensure that risk premia on 
lending rates do not rise sharply.
7 In July, the European Central Bank adjusted the 
weights for calculating the effective exchange rates for 
the euro area. The broad group of countries was ex-
panded from 38 to 42 countries. In addition, the 
weights now take account of trade in services as well 
as trade in goods; see European Central Bank (2020). 
The method used by the Bundesbank to calculate indi-
cators of the German economy’s price competitiveness 
has been changed in line with this; see Deutsche Bun-
desbank (2020f).
8 The coronavirus measures are relatively narrowly de-
fi  ned here: they do not include, for example, climate- 
related expenditure from the June 2020 economic 
stimulus package. This is longer-term and pursues ob-
jectives that go beyond short- term crisis support.Deutsche Bundesbank

have only a moderate impact, and then al-
most no effect from 2022 onwards.
The expenditure side mainly includes trans-
fers by central government to enterprises, 
self- employed persons and those in liberal 
professions. In addition, the Federal Em-
ployment Agency provides relief to enter-
prises in terms of the social security contri-
butions they pay on short- time working 
benefi  ts (with restrictions until the end of 
2021).9 For public passenger transport com-
panies, the government is partially compen-
sating losses this year. The eligibility criteria 
for the basic allowance (unemployment 
benefi  t II) were relaxed and entitlements to 
unemployment benefi  t were extended. Par-
ents were supported by a child bonus. Gov-
ernment grants will stabilise the renewable 
energy (EEG) levy in electricity prices next 
year in order to ease the burden on enter-
prises and households. Additional expend-
iture is also required in healthcare: this ex-
penditure was initially for protective equip-
ment, additional intensive care capacity and COVID- 19 tests, and will be for vaccinations 
further down the line as well. In addition, 
central government is reimbursing hospitals 
for unoccupied beds in order to ensure cap-
acity for the treatment of COVID- 19 pa-
tients. Other parts of the healthcare sector 
were also compensated for coronavirus- 
 related losses.
One factor on the revenue side is that VAT 
rates were temporarily lowered for the 
second half of 2020. A number of other 
measures essentially only shift tax revenue 
to a different point in time. For instance, 
enterprises were able to receive special VAT 
reimbursements in advance. Furthermore, 
import VAT will fall due one month later 
from next year onwards. Looking at taxes 
on earnings, enterprises are again able, 
amongst other things, temporarily to apply 
the declining balance method of depreci-
ation when handling movable assets and to 
carry back losses from 2020 to a greater ex-
tent.
In addition to these measures affecting the 
defi  cit, the projection takes into account 
coronavirus measures that are refl  ected 
solely in the level of debt. These include, 
fi  rst and foremost, lending programmes 
with very extensive government guarantees 
and capital assistance. The debt effects of 
this are estimated to be 2% of GDP this 
year, which means that the use of this op-
tion is signifi  cantly below the extensive 
budgetary authorisations. In addition, debt 
(excluding the defi  cit effect) is temporarily 
rising slightly as enterprises receive tax de-
ferrals and statutory health and public long- 
term care insurance schemes receive central 
government grants.
In addition to the coronavirus measures, 
the projection takes other fi  scal measures 
into account. It is assumed that health in-
surance institutions will raise their supple-Coronavirus response measures affecting

exports will pick up somewhat less sharply than 
German exporters’ sales markets. Compared 
with other euro area Member States, the price 
competitiveness of German enterprises will di -
minish as a result of stronger wage growth and 
higher domestic inflation.
The strained infection situation and the result -
ing uncertainty for sales prospects are likely to 
initially weigh on the propensity of many enter -
prises to invest. The gloomier export outlook is 
also slowing the recovery in industrial activity. 
As a result, production capacity utilisation will 
remain weak for the time being, which means 
that only a small amount of investment in 
renewing  and expanding capacities will be re -
quired. However, as soon as the economy 
returns  to its recovery path in the second quar -
ter of 2021, foreign demand rises and under -
utilisation falls, business investment should also 
regain momentum with a certain time lag. By 
the end of the projection horizon, business in -
vestment will then probably have returned to a level that corresponds to normal economic 
conditions.
Private consumption remains heavily depend -
ent on the pandemic situation. In the first half 
of 2020, consumers’ spending fell significantly 
more sharply than their disposable income, and 
the saving ratio mirrored this development, ris -
ing very steeply. While classic precautionary 
motives played a comparatively minor role, this 
development was primarily due to involuntary 
consumption restraint resulting from the pan -
demic and the measures taken to contain it: 
consumption opportunities were either not 
available or were not used by consumers owing 
to the risk of infection (see the box on pp. 26 f.). 
Although the saving ratio fell again markedly in 
the third quarter and private consumption 
made up a significant amount of ground, in the 
final quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 
2021, the pandemic situation, which has again 
become significantly more strained, is likely to 
restrict private consumption once more, result -Business invest -

2020, of which almost 1 percentage point 
will be in 2022). The contribution rate to 
the Federal Employment Agency will rise by 
0.1  percentage point in both 2022 and 
2023 to its planned level of 2.6%. In add-
ition, the contribution rate to the statutory 
pension insurance scheme will have to be 
increased at the end of the projection hori-
zon so that the reserve meets its lower limit. 
By contrast, revenue from income- related 
taxes is set to undergo a signifi  cant reduc-
tion, particularly as the solidarity surcharge 
will be partly abolished in 2021. On the ex-
penditure side, the increase in child benefi  t 
from 2021 onwards and the new basic pen-
sion will make themselves felt. In addition, 
higher government capital transfers will be 
made not least in order to reduce the use of 
carbon energy sources and to foster digi-
talisation. The planned, credit- fi  nanced 
“Next Generation EU” (NGEU) off- budget entity has already been taken into account: 
Germany will receive grants from this, 
which will predominantly be used for exist-
ing programmes according to announce-
ments by the Federal Government. The in-
clusion of NGEU has virtually no direct im-
pact on the projection of Germany’s public 
fi  nances owing to its small volume (rising 
from 0.1% of GDP in 2021 to 0.2% in 
2023).10
10 Overall, Germany will be burdened more heavily in 
future due to the EU budget. Owing to Brexit, net fi  -
nancial contributions will increase from 2021. In the 
longer term, the crisis programmes will also weigh on 
Germany: payments to fi  nance the NGEU grants sig-
nifi  cantly exceed the NGEU grants the country will re-
ceive. The EU debt will have to be serviced by Member 
States, which is not refl  ected in the national fi  scal indi-
cators. See pp. 37 ff.Deutsche Bundesbank

ing in an increase in the saving ratio.7 However, 
private consumption is likely to suffer far less 
than in the second quarter of 2020. If, from the 
second quarter of 2021 onwards, the pan -
demic is gradually overcome by medical solu -
tions, involuntary saving should diminish in sig -
nificance. Private consumption would then re -
cover very dynamically. Subsequently, then, 
some of the involuntary savings accumulated 
during the pandemic are likely to be spent in 
addition, and consumption will probably be 
caught up on. As this would be a temporary 
effect, private consumption is likely to lose sig -
nificant momentum at a high level towards the 
end of the projection horizon.
Housing construction investment has proved 
relatively robust to the pandemic over the 
course of 2020 thus far given that there have 
been only few restrictions on the supply side 
and demand has been affected only slightly. The 
second wave, too, has so far had only a small 
impact on sentiment in the construction sector. Following a slight decline in the final quarter of 
2020 and the first quarter of 2021, housing con -
struction investment should return to an expan -
sionary path that is in line with economic recov -
ery from the second quarter of 2021 onwards. 
The improvement in the labour market and 
wages, which have been gradually rising more 
sharply again, will provide impetus.
The coronavirus pandemic has also so far left 
little mark on price dynamics in the housing 
market. This is partly due to the fact that de -
mand for housing in connection with the pan -
demic fell only briefly. Households’ disposable 
income, a key determinant of demand, rose 
substantially again as early as the third quarter 
of 2020. In addition, a temporary shift in de -
mand towards housing due to the pandemic-  
induced relocation of professional and private 
activities to the home might have triggered a 
certain additional price impulse. Moreover, resi -
dential real estate is likely to remain an attract -
ive form of investment in the low interest rate 
environment. On the supply side, meanwhile, 
there were hardly any disruptions that might 
have caused price- driving effects. Looking 
ahead, however, price dynamics are likely to 
weaken. For example, the affordability of 
credit- financed housing has deteriorated fur -
ther in the light of the ongoing upward pres -
sure on prices, despite the still highly favour -
able financing rates. In addition, the trend shift 
in demand for housing to areas outside urban 
centres, where the housing supply could be ex -
panded more easily, could pick up steam as a 
result of the pandemic. Nevertheless, inflation 
rates will probably level off only gradually given 
the usual price inelasticity of housing.

develop dynamically this year and next. Priority 
areas will include transport and digital infra - Overall, housing

structures, childcare and schools. However, the 
coronavirus crisis will also weigh on the finan -
cial situation of central, state and local govern -
ments in the medium term, and the reserves in 
the fund to promote municipal investment will 
be depleted. It is therefore assumed that growth 
will decelerate markedly thereafter.
Real government consumption has been rising 
sharply this year as a result of the coronavirus 
pandemic. Compensation payments to hos -
pitals for unoccupied beds as well as expend -
iture on personal protective equipment are 
considerably increasing intermediate consump -
tion. In the years that follow, government con -
sumption will initially stagnate and then grow 
moderately, as the one- off additional expend -
iture in connection with the coronavirus pan -
demic will no longer be a factor. Moreover, in 
view of the structural deficits of the central, 
state and local governments, slower growth is 
assumed, especially in the case of intermediate 
consumption.
Following a significant decline this year, im -
ports will pick up substantially over the entire 
projection horizon in the wake of sharply rising 
demand from households and enterprises. 
Moreover, in 2022 and 2023, some of the in -
voluntary savings could be spent on additional 
foreign travel, which had been cut back par -
ticularly sharply during the crisis. This expend -
iture by Germans abroad is treated as imports 
of services.
The current account surplus, which fell signifi -
cantly in the second quarter of 2020 from more 
than 7% to just under 5% of GDP , already 
soared to just under 8% again in the third 
quarter. In the final quarter of 2020 and the 
first quarter of 2021, it could even temporarily 
rise somewhat more. The main reason for this 
is economic developments initially being less 
favourable in Germany compared with many 
non- European trading partners. As a result, im -
ports from these countries are growing more 
slowly than German exports to these countries.

Households’ saving behaviour during the pandemic
Projections of private consumption expend-
iture are decisively shaped by expectations 
about households’ disposable income and 
their saving ratio.1 The saving ratio rose ex-
ceptionally sharply in the fi  rst half of 2020. 
This was probably not driven to any signifi  cant 
degree by classical precautionary motives. An 
econometric analysis for the euro area 
showed, in fact, that only a relatively small 
percentage of the increase in the saving ratio in the second quarter of 2020 can be ex-
plained by concerns about future job losses 
and loss of income.2 On the contrary: much of 
the rise is attributed to involuntary saving 
caused by the pandemic. Saving motives in 
Germany are likely to have been similar.
Participants’ responses to the Bundesbank 
Online Panel Households (BOP-HH) in August 
2020 shed some light on the reasons why 
households were reluctant to consume in the 
fi  rst half of 2020.3 Just under one- half of re-
spondents said that they had reduced their 
consumption expenditure in connection with 
the restrictions imposed during the pandemic. 
Only just under one- sixth of respondents 
stated that this was primarily a result of a dir-
ect drop in income. In all other cases, motives 
affecting the saving ratio were decisive, with 
only around one-fi  fth citing classical precau-
tionary motives driven by fears of a future loss 
of income. Reasons directly related to the 
pandemic played a much greater role. Just 
under one- half of respondents reduced their 
consumption expenditure because a number 
of consumption options were not available or 
only partially available in the spring – for ex-
ample, because businesses were ordered to 
close or as a result of travel restrictions. This 
involuntary consumption restraint was par-
ticularly pronounced among higher- income 
households. This differs from the fi  ndings on 
the classical precautionary motive. Where 
consumption expenditure was reduced be-
cause households feared future income losses, 
the percentages were higher for lower- income 
households than for higher- income ones. 
Quite independently of the level of income, 
just over one- third also refrained from spend-
ing on certain goods and services for fear of 
catching the virus. Even without containment 
1 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2007).
2 See Dossche and Zlatanos (2020). The level of clas-
sical precautionary saving is nevertheless high by his-
torical standards.

over the remainder of the projection horizon. 
Owing to the then strong domestic activity, im -
ports will consistently rise more strongly than 
exports. The current account balance could 
therefore decline to 6½% of GDP by 2022, and 
subsequently continue to decrease.
Labour market
The labour market proved to be fairly robust to 
the economic turmoil caused by the pandemic. 
Fluctuations in employment and unemploy -
ment were comparatively moderate compared 
with the massive slump in the number of hours 
worked. This was due, in particular, to the ex -
tensive use of short- time work schemes to 
bridge the working hours lost, measures agreed 
by employers and trade unions to safeguard 
jobs, and stabilising government measures, as 
well as the rapid economic recovery which fol -
lowed the slump in the second quarter. Ac -
cordingly, despite the renewed sharp rise in economic output, only a small number of new 
employees were hired in the third quarter, and, 
instead, short- time work was cut back mas -
sively. In October, the employment level was 
still around 1½% below the pre- pandemic 
level.
In the final quarter of 2020 and the first quarter 
of 2021, the renewed temporary tightening of 
restrictions on economic activity will also ham -
per recovery in the labour market. Short- time 
work is likely to rise again in the sectors of the 
economy affected by closures, even though, 
overall, it will remain well below the level seen 
in the second quarter. Employment will fall 
slightly and unemployment could reach a 
somewhat higher level at the beginning of 
2021 than in the second quarter of 2020.
As the economy picks up, working hours, in 
turn, will rise again first from the second quar -
ter of 2021 onwards. The number of hours 
worked will grow, above all, as a result of the Labour market 
recovered 
slightly in Q3, 
short- time work 
sharply reducedRecovery to be 
interrupted in 
Q4 2020 and 
Q1 2021measures that directly limit certain consump-
tion opportunities, private consumption is 
therefore likely to suffer perceptibly if con-
sumers see themselves as being exposed to an 
increased risk of infection.4
The insights gleaned from the household sur-
vey can be applied to the projections of the 
saving ratio and private consumption. Saving 
resulting from classical precautionary motives 
depends mainly on developments in the la-
bour market. Once the labour market experi-
ences a sustained recovery, the stimulus for 
the saving ratio is likely to wane. However, the 
greater importance of involuntary saving and 
cautious behaviour for fear of infection mean 
that future developments in the saving ratio 
as a whole –  and thus also in private con-
sumption – are likely to remain closely linked 
to assumptions regarding the pandemic. Both 
motives should decline as infection rates come 
down and containment measures can be in-
crementally lifted. Another question is what 
happens to the involuntary savings created 
during the pandemic once the health crisis is over. As this form of saving is not really in line 
with households’ preferences, one might, in 
principle, expect at least a certain part of it to 
be spent later. The saving ratio will therefore 
fall below its long-run average for some time. 
However, as the additional savings have been 
built up mainly by households with higher in-
comes, the assumption for such catch- up ef-
fects incorporated in the projection tends to 
be conservative. These households have a 
comparatively low propensity to consume in 
relation to their income,5 and a large part of 
their involuntary savings could lead to wealth 
remaining elevated for some time.
4 Roughly 45% of those questioned said that they 
considered some of their previous consumption ex-
penditure to be unnecessary or imprudent. This could 
be because consumption options were not available 
during the lockdown (for instance travel). It could, 
however, also indicate that consumption behaviour 
has been adjusted, potentially permanently, in re-
sponse to the pandemic.

reduction in short- time work and working time 
accounts being filled up. From the second half 
of next year onwards, growing success in com -
bating the pandemic is likely to increase the 
planning certainty of enterprises and thus also 
their willingness to recruit new staff. Even so, 
on an annual average for 2021, the employ -
ment level will still fall significantly short of the 
previous year’s level at the beginning of the 
year due to a considerable carry- over effect. By 
comparison, employment growth will be fairly 
robust in 2022. On the other hand, the growth 
in working hours per person in employment 
will decelerate as these converge towards pre- 
crisis levels.
Contrary to employment, annual average un -
employment for 2021 will be higher than the 
previous year’s level. Although it will decline at 
an accelerated pace from mid- 2021 onwards, it 
will not reach its pre- crisis level over the projec -
tion horizon. Its very low pre- pandemic level 
was the result of a long and mature upswing.The labour supply is not heavily influenced by 
the pandemic, but it is influenced to some ex -
tent. The labour force is growing at a much 
slower pace in 2020 than previously and will 
even fall slightly in 2021. Some members of the 
workforce withdrew from the labour market, at 
least temporarily, when they lost their jobs. This 
is particularly the case for those who are not 
entitled to payments from the Federal Employ -
ment Agency, for example, because they were 
previously in low- paid employment. Labour 
force participation is therefore likely to show 
signs of a dip in the short term. Furthermore, 
immigration to Germany, which had played a 
major role in the upturn in employment in re -
cent years, was considerably hampered by the 
pandemic- related restrictions. This year, net im -
migration to Germany will be roughly half as 
high as it was in 2019. From mid- 2021 on -
wards, immigration is likely to go back up, 
which means that net migration to Germany 
could return to 250,000 persons over the 
course of the year. A minor catch- up effect is 
assumed in 2022. Together with rising labour 
force participation, this would lead to an in -
crease in the size of the labour force.
Looking ahead to 2023 and beyond, however, 
it can be assumed that the underlying demo -
graphic developments will increasingly curtail 
the size of the labour force, despite high immi -
gration and a growing propensity amongst in -
dividuals to participate in the labour force. Ac -
cordingly, employment will barely be able to 
rise further and labour supply constraints from 
the pre- crisis period will return.
Labour costs and prices
Negotiated pay rates rose more slowly during 
the crisis than previously. Against the backdrop 
of the significant economic slump, in the 2020 
pay round, employers and trade unions mostly 
agreed on job- protecting measures and low 
pay agreements. In the coming year, too, em -
ployers and trade unions will predominantly 
agree on small wage increases in the light of As economy

the still subdued economic activity and higher 
unemployment. Employers and trade unions 
will not return to higher pay agreements until 
2022 onwards when there is continued eco -
nomic recovery.8
The impact of labour market adjustments on 
actual earnings has been even more pro -
nounced than on the negotiated pay rate. In 
particular, the large- scale deployment of short- 
time work schemes reduced the paid working 
hours per person in employment. The loss of 
earnings in some sectors was mitigated by ne -
gotiated or voluntary supplements by employ -
ers,9 which, in contrast to short- time working 
benefits, are a component of gross wages and 
salaries in the national accounts. Nevertheless, 
average actual earnings fell exceptionally 
sharply in the second quarter of 2020 and 
slightly for 2020 as a whole. As short- time 
work declines and working hours thus grad -
ually increase, actual earnings will rise again 
more significantly, little by little. In the last year 
of the projection horizon, in addition to the 
then normalised economic framework data, in -
tensified labour market shortages will also lead 
to substantial wage growth. Rising employer 
social contribution rates for the statutory 
health, unemployment and pension insurance 
schemes will additionally increase compensa -
tion per employee in 2022 and 2023 and con -
tribute to upward pressure on prices.
Unit labour costs are rising exceptionally steeply 
this year due to the crisis. This reflects the fact 
that labour productivity per person in employ -
ment is falling sharply, while labour costs are 
changing comparatively little.10 As the econ -
omy begins to recover, labour productivity is 
then likely to initially rise more strongly than 
labour costs. Unit labour costs will therefore 
fall markedly, especially in the coming year. Do -
mestic inflation as measured by the GDP defla -
tor will not be impacted by the sharp fluctu -
ations in unit labour costs. Instead, these will 
be largely cushioned using aggregate profit 
margins. In 2023, unit labour costs will provide 
a more robust signal of domestic price pres -sures once more. As things currently stand, unit 
labour costs are likely to then rise markedly and 
enterprises’ profit margins could also improve 
again somewhat. The GDP deflator could thus 
increase by around 1¾%.
Consumer inflation continued to decline over 
the second and third quarters, sinking to -0.7% 
in November as measured by the Harmonised 
Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). Besides falling 
energy prices, the VAT cut from July to Decem -
ber, of which probably just over 60% has been 
passed through to consumers, is also having an 
impact.11 Setting aside this change to tax legis -
lation, which was not included in the June pro -
jection, prices have developed roughly as ex -
pected over the last few months. For instance, Actual earnings

9 Special coronavirus payments, which are not subject to

10 At present, the large- scale deployment of short- time 
work, in particular, is reducing labour productivity. Here, as 
in the table on p. 25, the development of productivity and 
wages is described per capita. On an hourly basis, product -

net food prices have risen sharply, not least 
owing to adverse weather conditions and 
higher costs for preventing the spread of infec -
tion. Looking at non- energy industrial goods 
and services, the weak demand caused by the 
pandemic did lead to significant price reduc -
tions in specific segments such as clothing and travel. On the other hand, however, the damp -
ening impact on prices was limited overall as it 
was counteracted by higher costs stemming 
from measures aimed at containing the num -
ber of infections or supply shortages. Excluding 
the VAT cut, annual average core inflation in 
2020 therefore still stands at just over 1%, 
which is consistent with the average recorded 
over the past few years. Taking into account 
the tax cut, the core rate is likely to be 0.7%. 
Headline HICP inflation will probably rise by 
0.4%.
The underlying inflation trend will remain sub -
dued next year. Both aggregate demand and 
wage growth will remain muted at first, only 
becoming apparent in the inflation rate with a 
time lag. Furthermore, the costs incurred in 
connection with the measures to contain the 
pandemic will become less significant. How -
ever, the subdued underlying trend will be 
overshadowed by the reversal of the VAT cut. 
This is based on the assumption that, in re -
sponse to the tax change, prices will be raised 
as sharply in January 2021 as they were lowered 
in July 2020.12 Moreover, additional climate 
package measures will enter into force at the 
beginning of 2021. The introduction of carbon 
emission certificates in the transport and heat -
ing sectors will see a steep rise in prices for re -
fined petroleum products and gas, which will 
only be partially offset by cuts to electricity 
prices.13 The climate package also involves an 
increase in motor vehicle tax, which is included 
in the services component and thus the core 
inflation rate; this will also drive prices up.

12 Based on the current state of knowledge, towards the

13 The climate package has been included in the projec -
tions since December 2019; see Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2019). The price path envisaged at the time for the carbon 
emission certificates was lower than today’s figures. Be -
sides this, in June 2020, the EEG levy, which is an important 
component of electricity prices, was capped in 2021 and 
2022. Together, the climate package measures and the cap

ritory from the beginning of 2021. As things 
currently stand, the second half of the year 
may well see fairly high inflation rates of around 
2½% as prices in 2020 were dampened by the 
VAT cut.
From the beginning of 2022, these legislative 
changes will barely influence consumer price 
inflation,14 and the HICP rate will probably re -
flect the economic situation more closely again. 
This applies to both the core rate and the head -
line rate, as energy and food prices are not 
likely to put a great deal of upward pressure on 
prices. However, prices should pick up owing 
to renewed wage growth. In addition, profit 
margins, which had previously been depressed, 
should also recover as aggregate demand rises. 
This is all the more true given that market con -
centration could increase in individual seg -
ments as a result of business closures in the 
wake of the pandemic. The remaining suppliers 
in these areas would then be able to increase 
their margins more easily. Overall, core and 
headline inflation –  adjusted for legislative 
changes – could therefore climb from just over 
1% in 2021 to 1.3% in 2022 before increasing 
further to around 1.5% or slightly more in 
2023.
Public finances
Public finances are stabilising economic devel -
opments to a considerable degree this year. Ac -
cording to this projection, the government 
budget deficit will stand at around 5% of GDP 
after recording a surplus of 1.5% of GDP in 
2019. The deficit will decline only slightly next 
year as the expiry of the measures to deal with 
the coronavirus pandemic is offset by expan -
sionary fiscal policy elsewhere. In 2022, as 
coronavirus measures continue to expire and 
the economy recovers, the government deficit 
will then fall significantly. In 2023, the deficit 
will move towards 1% of GDP . Overall, the un -
certainty surrounding the forecast remains high 
as a result of the coronavirus crisis.In structural terms – i.e. adjusted for cyclical 
and other temporary effects – public finances 
are likely to be in worse shape at the end of the 
projection horizon than before the crisis. The 
structural surplus of ½% of GDP in 2019 will be 
transformed into a structural deficit of around 
1% of GDP in 2023, mainly owing to strong 
growth in spending on pensions, health and 
long- term care, as well as plans for the decar -
bonisation and digitalisation of the economy. 
Interest expenditure will have somewhat of a 
counterbalancing effect. Despite the higher 
debt ratio, it will continue to fall sharply, as 
interest rates on the high levels of new borrow -
ing induced by the crisis are assumed to be 
negative on average. As a result, the average 
interest rate on government debt will fall again 
significantly, and could amount to just ½% in 
2023.
The coronavirus pandemic, in particular, is 
shaping developments in 2020. The downturn 
is causing taxes and social contributions from 
regular employment to fall whilst, at the same 
time, expenditure on short- time working and 
unemployment benefits is rising. The measures 
taken to combat the coronavirus are having an Economic recov -

even greater impact (see pp. 21f. for more in -
formation about the fiscal policy measures that 
these entail).
In 2021, the deficit will fall to around 4% of 
GDP . The economic cycle will have only slightly 
less of a negative impact on the government 
budget. Although economic activity will pick 
up, labour market developments, which are 
particularly important for the government 
budget, will lag behind. The fact that most of 
the coronavirus measures will be phased out by 
the end of 2021 will, in itself, significantly re -
duce the deficit. However, decisions that in -
crease the deficit will be taken elsewhere. Fur -
thermore, expenditure on pensions, healthcare 
and long- term care insurance will rise sharply.15
In 2022, the deficit will then fall more sharply 
to around 2% of GDP , mainly as the economic 
recovery will be having a greater impact on the 
government budget. Moreover, most of the 
pandemic support measures will now have ex -
pired. Social spending will continue to grow 
fairly sharply, but will be offset by rising social 
contribution rates.
The debt ratio, i.e. government debt over GDP , 
will rise to around 70% in 2020 (2019: 59.6%). 
Government deficits are financed primarily 
through additional government borrowing. Fi -
nancial assets such as reserves belonging to so -
cial security funds are being deployed only to a 
small extent. In addition, the government-  
guaranteed coronavirus assistance loans, gov -
ernment capital injections and higher cash re -
serves are pushing up debt (coronavirus- related 
one- off effects which generally have no impact 
on the deficit). Moreover, nominal GDP in the 
denominator of the debt ratio is declining. The 
debt ratio will fall only slightly in 2021. Over the 
remainder of the period, however, it will then 
decline more sharply to around 65% in 2023. 2021: only mod -

From 2022 onwards, local government deficits 
will thus be significantly lower again and the 
coronavirus- related one- off effects will be re -
duced. Moreover, the portfolios of government- 
owned bad banks will continue to decline and 
nominal GDP will expand very significantly at 
times.
Risk assessment and 
 alternative scenarios
The outlook for the German economy in terms 
of economic activity and consumer prices re -
mains unusually uncertain overall. Compared 
to the spring, more is now known about the 
virus, the measures to prevent its spread and 
the effects on the behaviour of economic 
agents and the economy itself. However, it re -
mains difficult to gauge how the pandemic will 
unfold and what the macroeconomic conse -
quences will be. In a situation like this, alterna -
tive scenarios help to illustrate the complex un -
certainties surrounding the medical situation 
and its economic impact.16
However, risks to the macroeconomic outlook 
are not limited to those arising directly from 
the pandemic. The German economy is also 
heavily dependent on global trade. The uncer -
tainties that currently exist here are mainly 
centred around future trade relations between 
the EU and the United Kingdom as negoti -
ations on the structure of a future trade deal 
are still ongoing. Although the projection al -
ready errs on the side of caution by assuming 
there will be a need to fall back on the World 
Trade Organization’s “most favoured nation” 
rules (see the box on pp. 19 ff.), there are also 
downside risks relating to the economic impli -
cations this might have. There is a certain de -
gree of hope that foreign demand will become 
more buoyant if the uncertainties that have 
surrounded global trade linkages for some time 
decline because, for instance, US trade policy is 
becoming more predictable. From today’s per -
spective, this would result in a broadly bal -
anced distribution of upside and downside risks to the GDP and inflation outlook in the context 
of the international environment. This is also 
true from an overall perspective, as the risks as -
sociated with the pandemic are also broadly 
balanced. Although deviations would be more Uncertainty

serious in the more severe scenario than in the 
milder scenario, the milder scenario is some -
what more likely to occur.
In the milder scenario, medical solutions are 
available more promptly in Germany and 
abroad and are implemented more quickly. For 
example, large parts of the population might 
already receive a vaccination in the course of 
next year. The number of infections falls rapidly. 
Under these conditions, the containment meas -
ures could be fully phased out by the end of 
2021.
In this scenario, German enterprises’ foreign 
demand recovers more quickly and private con -
sumption in Germany expands earlier and more 
sharply. GDP already reaches its pre- crisis level 
in mid- 2021; growth in 2022 and 2023 is none -
theless similar to that of the baseline scenario. 
The labour market picks up more quickly and 
unemployment falls to pre- pandemic lows by 
the end of the forecast horizon. Against this 
backdrop, potential output will remain largely 
unimpaired. The output gap will already have 
closed by the end of 2021 and will be in signifi -
cantly positive territory from 2022 onwards. Al -
though the price- driving effects of the costs of 
combatting the pandemic are smaller, given 
the more favourable macroeconomic environ -
ment, the inflation rate will nevertheless be 
somewhat higher than in the baseline scenario, 
especially in 2022 and 2023. In this scenario, 
public finances will develop much more favour -
ably. The main reason for this is the more up -
beat economic situation, which will lead to 
higher revenue from taxes and social contribu -
tions and lower expenditure on unemployment 
benefits.
The more severe scenario assumes that the de -
velopments in the crisis remain serious. Despite 
more stringent countermeasures, the pandemic 
is insufficiently contained in the final quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021; over the 
next few years, too, these attempts achieve 
only limited success. The time taken to imple -
ment medical solutions in Germany and abroad 
spans the entire projection horizon, for in -
stance because vaccines’ effectiveness dimin -
ishes or because vaccination rates are not suffi -
ciently high. Containment measures have to 
remain in place until the end of 2023, although 
they are eased little by little.
In this scenario, aggregate output will be af -
fected substantially and on a sustained basis, 
despite even stronger support from public fi -
nances. This is because demand for German 
exports will be persistently weak and private 
consumption will remain depressed for a long 
time owing to the constraints and an increased 
propensity to save. The labour market situation 
will barely improve. In a scenario like this, GDP 
will be very slow to recover, only returning to 
its pre- crisis level at the end of the projection 
horizon, if at all. The impact on potential out -
put and its growth would be severe and last -
ing. In this scenario, aggregate capacity re -
mains underutilised over the entire projection 
horizon. Under these conditions, although 
combatting the pandemic will cause consider -
able costs for enterprises, leading to price in -
creases, persistently weak demand for goods 
and the slack in the labour market will signifi -
cantly dampen pressure on wages and prices 
and limit the scope for passing through higher 
costs. On balance, then, consumer price infla -
tion will be markedly weaker than in the base -
line scenario. Public finances will be signifi -
cantly worse off in this scenario. The less fa -
vourable economic situation will push up the 
deficit ratio. It is assumed that enterprises will 
continue to receive direct assistance and that 
some coronavirus assistance loans will default. 
In addition, enterprises will rely more heavily on 
government assistance loans and equity cap -

The informative value of national 
fiscal   indicators in respect of debt 
at the   European level
Fiscal policy has been playing a significant stabilising role during the coronavirus crisis, and meas -
ures funded nationally are at the forefront of these efforts. That said, extensive fiscal packages 
have been initiated at the European level, too. More than €1 trillion in borrowing – i.e. above 7% 
of the European Union’s gross domestic product (EU GDP) – has been lined up for grants and 
concessional loans. This is fundamentally different than before. First, this move is intended to 
usher in a significant increase in borrowing. Second, the funds raised will no longer be used only 
to supply assistance loans but also for issuing grants to Member States on a considerable scale. 
The upshot of this is that the European level will have notable deficits for the first time, and debt 
servicing will weigh on future EU budgets.
This article illuminates the impact of this European debt, and these European deficits, on the 
informative value of national fiscal indicators. Analyses are usually based on national data and 
examine matters such as the sustainability of public finances or the effect of fiscal impulses on 
economic activity. Up until now, the EU budget has largely featured in these analyses as a direct 
component of national fiscal indicators, given that it is mostly funded by contributions made in 
the same year by Member States. This meant it could be disregarded by analysts. The situation is 
now set to change. Looking ahead, national deficits and debt will be lower initially if a Member 
State’s expenditure is funded not by national borrowing but by debt- financed EU grants. While 
this improves the Member State’s national fiscal indicators, its financial position will not be any 
better overall. This is because European debt will need to be serviced by taxpayers in the Member 
States at some point in the future on top of the national debt burden. Instead of interest and 
principal payments on national debt, there will be larger contributions to the EU budget.
Given this backdrop, it is crucially important, from the perspective of economic and fiscal policy 
analysis, for government revenue, expenditure, deficits and debt to be computed using statistical 
methods and reported in a transparent manner not just nationally but at the European level, too. 
Disclosures should follow the definitions used in the national accounts and be made available in 
a timely manner, just as they are for the Member States. That particularly goes for the Maastricht 
deficit and the Maastricht debt level. This is not currently the case. The final decision adopting the 
programmes needs to enshrine this form of statistical reporting on developments at the European 
level.
These disclosures could be used to provide a more comprehensive picture of the fiscal burdens 
weighing on Member States, amongst other things. There would be less risk of losing sight of 
European debt and the fiscal strain it involves. Budgetary rules should likewise take the European 
fiscal burdens into account. Rules that apply only to national indicators will be hollowed out if 
deficits and debt are transferred on a significant scale to the European level. It would also make 
sense for the national fiscal indicators designed to measure the effects of a fiscal impulse on eco -
nomic activity to give consideration to payment flows with the EU.Deutsche Bundesbank

European government sector 
borrowing enters new 
 dimensions
Fiscal policy has been playing a significant sta -
bilising role during the coronavirus crisis, with 
individual Member States bearing the brunt of 
this challenge. That said, extensive packages 
have also been rolled out at the European level1 
in support of Member States.2 Measures in -
clude:3
– Up to €240 billion in debt raised by the 
European Stability Mechanism (ESM) for 
concessional loans to euro area countries;
– EU debt of up to €100 billion for conces -
sional SURE loans4 to EU countries; and
– EU debt of up to €750 billion (at 2018 
prices)5 for Next Generation EU (NGEU) as -
sistance in the form of grants and conces -
sional loans to EU countries.
The European level had already raised debt be -
fore the advent of the coronavirus crisis, though 
the volume at that time was considerably 
smaller (EU: just over €50 billion; ESM: just 
under €120 billion). The newly adopted assis -
tance programmes are set to be significantly 
larger in scope. On top of this, the NGEU pro -
gramme is designed not only to provide loans 
to Member States but to issue non- repayable 
grants as well. In the past, EU debt was nor -
mally backed by claims on Member States, the 
idea being that it would be serviced out of the 
borrowers’ debt service payments. In effect, 
the European government level reported no 
deficits (within the meaning of the national ac -
counts) because the (net) financial assets re -
mained unchanged. Under the new grant pro -
grammes, however, there are no credit claims 
to offset the European debt, which means the 
European government level will run deficits as 
defined in the national accounts. In subsequent 
years, the debt raised to fund these pro -
grammes will then have to be serviced out of 
the EU budget using Member State contribu -tions.6 The EU budget will need to cover any 
interest charges that accrue plus the principal 
payments over the period from 2028 to 2058. 
Contribution- financed surpluses (as defined in 
the national accounts) would need to be gen -
erated in the EU budget in the amount needed 
to cover the principal payments.
Under the existing arrangement, any deficits 
and debt incurred at the European level are not 
reflected in the deficits and debt levels reported 
by Member States. This makes future national 
fiscal indicators less informative. Up to now, EU 
expenditure has largely been reflected directly 
in the aggregated national indicators, given 
that it was normally funded by Member States 
in the same year by their contributions to the 
EU budget. This meant that Member States’ 
deficits and debt levels were correspondingly 
higher. The new arrangement will see a not -European assis -

1 For the purposes of this article, “European level” means 
government activity at the supranational European level. 
The government sector at the European level comprises EU 
institutions, such as the EU budget, as well as intergovern -
mental agreements between European states, such as the 
ESM.

(2020a); for those from July, see Deutsche Bundesbank

3 Member States are contributing furthermore, in the form 
of guarantees, to the pan-  European guarantee fund cre -
ated by the European Investment Bank (EIB) with a view to 
mobilising up to €200 billion as a source of financial sup -
port, above all for small and medium- sized enterprises. The 
EIB does not form part of the European government sector. 
Routine checks are generally made to establish whether ac -
tivities performed by non- government units at the request 
of government should be assigned for statistical purposes 
to the government budget (rerouting). Some activities per -
formed by KfW Group on behalf of the Federal Govern -
ment fall into this category, for example. If the pan-  
European guarantee fund were to provide actual funding in 
addition to guarantees, this would probably have to be 
recorded statistically in the budgets of participating Mem -
ber States.
4 SURE stands for “Support mitigating Unemployment 
Risks in Emergency”.
5 Stating figures at 2018 prices means that the authorised 
volume of loans and grants increases annually at a fixed 
rate of 2%. This arrangement means that the NGEU pro -
gramme will have a volume of €795 billion (€750 billion at 
2018 prices) in its scheduled launch year of 2021. Since not 
all the resources will be allocated in 2021, the total amount, 
priced accordingly, will depend on how it is distributed over 
time; the volume here refers to payments (rather than com -
mitments incurred).
6 The plan is for Member States to fund these additional 
contributions in part by levying a new tax harmonised 
across the EU.Deutsche Bundesbank

Borrowing options available at the European level for 
funding  COVID- 19 response measures
To help alleviate the impact of the COVID- 
19 crisis, it was agreed in April 2020 to sim-
plify access to the credit facilities offered by 
the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). 
This step means that euro area countries 
can now draw on credit facilities even if 
they are not subject to a macroeconomic 
adjustment programme. Funding for this 
European debt is jointly guaranteed via the 
ESM, which is why the ESM’s assistance 
loans (up to 2% of euro area gross domes-
tic product (GDP) in total, which roughly 
equates to €240 billion) offer particularly fa-
vourable interest rates. The Member States 
have not yet applied to use any of the 
ESM’s credit lines, however.
In addition a new instrument known as 
SURE (“Support mitigating Unemployment 
Risks in Emergency”) was created. This au-
thorises the European Commission to raise 
up to €100 billion in debt on the EU’s be-
half. The idea is to provide EU Member 
States with concessional loans so that un-
employment risks can be mitigated – for ex-
ample, by providing short- time work bene-
fi  ts. Eighteen countries intend to tap into 
these loans, and around €90 billion has al-
ready been earmarked. Borrowing for the 
SURE instrument is underwritten by guaran-
tees issued by Member States alongside 
what are known as budgetary margins. 
These margins in future EU budgets come 
about because the maximum amount of 
Member States’ contributions to the EU 
budget that can be drawn down (the own- 
resources ceiling) is higher than the annual 
expenditure in the EU budget.
July 2020 saw the European Council agree 
on the Next Generation EU (NGEU) assis-
tance programme which, like SURE, is 
funded by EU borrowing. Repayment is guaranteed by increased margins in future 
EU budgets. NGEU’s expected volume is 
€750 billion (at 2018 prices). Its centrepiece 
is the Resilience and Recovery Facility (RRF), 
which will see Member States receiving 
(non- repayable) grants totalling just over 
€310 billion. Further NGEU grants (of just 
under €80 billion) are to be provided 
through programmes included in the forth-
coming medium- term fi  nancial framework’s 
EU budget. Member States furthermore 
stand to receive a total of €360 billion in 
concessional loans. Funding conditions for 
the NGEU debt will probably be very favour-
able because the budgetary margin secur-
ing it is scheduled to rise sharply. Specifi  c-
ally, the own- resources ceiling is to be in-
creased by 0.6% of gross national income 
(GNI) till 2058 (to 2% of GNI). If scheduled 
payments are not made (for example, if a 
country does not service its assistance loan), 
the remaining countries will generally be 
approached to cover payment on a pro rata 
basis.
NGEU has not yet been adopted, so a fi  nal 
decision on how the resources will be allo-
cated across Member States is still pending. 
The European Commission has tabled a 
grants allocation key per Member State, 
based on population size, per capita GDP 
and pre- crisis unemployment. The decline 
in GDP brought about by the coronavirus in 
2020 and 2021 will only be a factor for a 
small part of the grants. Loans are to be 
capped at 6.8% of a country’s GDP . All 
NGEU resources need to be committed by 
the end of 2023 but can also be disbursed 
at a later date. Outfl  ows will ultimately de-
pend on how the national plans are imple-
mented.Deutsche Bundesbank

able portion of deficits and debt being shifted 
to the European level. National deficits and 
debt will be depressed (c.p.) when the Euro -
pean level borrows funds to disburse to Mem -
ber States in the form of grants. The upshot of 
this is that the national fiscal indicators will ap -
pear more favourable initially, though European 
debt will still need to be serviced out of Mem -
ber States’ tax revenue, in addition to their na -
tional debt. In later years, Member States will 
face the burden of higher contributions to the 
EU budget to service the debt. Analyses of eco -
nomic and fiscal policy will need to take ac -
count of these shifts between the national and 
European levels, which is why developments at 
the European level merit attention alongside 
the national fiscal data.
Make comprehensive 
 reporting at the European 
level mandatory to create 
transparency
Economic and fiscal policy analysis can only de -
liver meaningful insights if the underlying na -
tional and European statistics alike are com -
piled in a complete, reliable and transparent 
manner. The European System of Accounts 
(ESA) is a harmonised reporting system, with 
Member States providing comprehensive sets 
of quarterly data in a timely manner. The ESA 
catalogues the various revenue and expend -
iture items for the government sector, with the 
balance being shown as net lending (+) or bor -
rowing (-) as defined in the national accounts. 
The Maastricht debt level of Member States is 
likewise calculated and disclosed according to 
a harmonised set of standards.
Comparable data have not yet been made 
available for the European level, but it would 
be important to do so, given the plans for the 
European level to incur deficits and debt on a 
substantial scale. Like the Member States, the 
European level needs to provide a complete set 
of national accounts data in a timely manner 
following the same classification criteria. Simi -larly, the Maastricht debt level and fiscal bal -
ance should be disclosed in Eurostat’s press re -
leases together with the national indicators. 
Any methodological issues should be ironed 
out by the same bodies that already ensure 
that national data are harmonised and quality- 
assured. In addition to the EU budget and the 
NGEU and SURE instruments, any other gov -
ernment activity at the European level would 
also need to be reported, showing the financial 
links to Member States. In the integrated na -
tional accounts system, the corresponding gov -
ernment revenue and expenditure items at the 
European level should match those reported at 
the Member State level. Another important 
point is to include the European level in the 
data on EU and euro area aggregates. The final 
decision adopting the NGEU programme 
should include a clause requiring the relevant 
statistical information to be made available in 
the future.
Supplement national fiscal 
indicators by adding 
 information on the European 
government sector
There now follows an example of how national 
fiscal indicators could be supplemented by dis -
closures on the European government sector. 
Since it is based on what currently appear to be 
plausible assumptions for the European level, 
the expected magnitude can be visualised for 
particularly relevant indicators.
Allocate European debt 
to Member States
Debt at the European level is ultimately the re -
sponsibility of the Member States. For instance, 
they underwrite the debt, commit to servicing 
that debt through contributions to the EU 
budget, or stand ready to inject additional cap -
ital into the ESM. For these reasons, European 
debt should be taken into account for analyt -
ical purposes; depending on the issue being Established stat -

analysed, it may also make sense to allocate 
them proportionally to the individual Member 
States.7
This applies to the EU debt already accumu -
lated by end-  2019,8 which came to just over 
€50 billion and is linked to balance of payments 
assistance to non- euro area countries, assis -
tance from the European Financial Stabilisation 
Mechanism (EFSM) established during the fi -
nancial and debt crisis, and financial aid to 
third countries. This is topped off by debt of 
just over €110 billion from the ESM (end- 2019) 
which was used to grant assistance loans to 
euro area countries.9
Another point is that, according to current 
budget plans, European debt is set to rise 
sharply this year and in the years thereafter.
– By the end of October, the European Com -
mission had already borrowed €17 billion for 
the SURE programme. This figure could 
come to €30 billion by the end of the year, 
and the total volume of €100 billion could 
be disbursed by the end of 2021.
– With regard to NGEU assistance loans, the 
18 Member States that have applied for 
SURE assistance loans to date could conceiv -
ably also take out NGEU loans to the largest 
extent permitted (6.8% of national GDP). 
Most of the maximum volume of €360 bil -
lion (at 2018 prices) would thus be taken up. 
It could be distributed according to a sched -
ule similar to that for the NGEU grants.
– The payment of the NGEU grants and the 
associated debt (around €390 billion at 2018 
prices) will depend on how the national 
plans are implemented. The European Com -
mission had assumed that outflows would 
rise fairly continuously until 2024 before fall -
ing again rapidly (see the chart above).10
– With regard to the timeline of the NGEU 
programme the planned annual price adjust -
ment of 2% should be taken into account (for more information, see footnote 5). By 
the end of 2026, this would culminate in a 
total volume of debt of just over €820 billion 
at current prices.
– As ESM credit lines have not yet been used 
to finance COVID-  19 response measures, the 
analysis does not include any additional 
European debt stemming from this.Allocate existing

7 The Maastricht debt level is a gross figure and also re -
ports debt which is matched by financial assets. Financial 
assets can be included in more in- depth analyses. For Euro -
pean debt, these would be European financial assets (such 
as claims on Member States).
8 The debts from the European Financial Stability Facility 
(EFSF) are attributed to the Member States. For the pur -
poses of the national accounts, it is assumed that EFSF 
loans are not granted by the EFSF, but by the Member 
States. Equally, it is assumed that Member States will refi -
nance themselves via loans from the EFSF. In this way, the 
debts from the EFSF are already captured in the Member 
States’ national debt.
9 The recipient countries’ debts vis- à- vis the ESM amount 
to €90 billion.
10 The European Commission outlined the potential time -
line for the disbursement of the Recovery and Resilience 
Facility (RRF) grants in its proposal of May 2020. By con -
trast, this article assumes that 10% (rather than just under 
6%) of the grants will be up and running in 2021, and that 
all grants will be disbursed to the Member States by the 
end of 2026 (rather than 2028), which is what the Euro -
pean Council had agreed. See European Commission 
(2020a), p. 40, and Council of the European Union (2020), 
p. 9 and p. 11. No information is available about the envis -
aged timeline for the non- RRF grants. For the purposes of 
the calculations performed in this article, they are distrib -
uted according to the same schedule as the RRF grants. 
The country shares expected by the European Commission 
sometimes differ from the share for RRF grants. See Euro -
pean Commission (2020b, 2020c, 2020d).Deutsche Bundesbank

To allocate this European debt to the Member 
States for analytical purposes, a distribution key 
first needs to be established. In terms of EU 
debt, a country’s share of financing in the EU 
budgets is a key factor. It is likely to remain 
broadly the same as a country’s share of EU 
gross national income (GNI).11 According to 
this, around one- quarter of European debt 
would be allocated to Germany. In the scenario 
described above, by 2026, this would amount 
to more than €280 billion, or around 8% of 
GDP of the year 2019 (including the ESM).12
Allocate European deficits 
to Member States
Deficits at the European level create a definite 
– rather than just a potential – future burden 
for Member States. It is therefore particularly 
important to take these into account when in -
terpreting national indicators. This can be dem -
onstrated using an illustrative example. The EU 
could borrow 10% of EU GDP and use these 
funds to disburse equally tranched grants to 
Member States over a period of four years. This 
would reduce their national deficits in each of 
these four years by around 2½% of their GDP . 
A glance at the national indicators alone would 
overstate the fiscal situation for this period. Al -
though the deficits would have been shifted to 
a different level, this would not ease the bur -
den on taxpayers. Shifts such as this could also 
hollow out those fiscal rules that target the na -
tional indicators. This would be the case, for 
example, for the 3% ceiling on national budget 
deficits under the Stability and Growth Pact.13
Specifically, because of the NGEU grants (ac -
cording to the assumptions outlined above), 
deficits of around €430 billion or 3% of EU 
GDP of the year 2019 are planned at the Euro -
pean level.14 The deficit would be highest in 
2024, at over €110 billion, or 0.8% of GDP of 
the year 2019. In turn, each Member State 
would then be allocated around 0.8% of the 
relevant GDP figure, according to its share of 
funding in the EU budget.15 Around €30 billion would be allocated to Germany in 2024, for ex -
ample.
Measure fiscal stance more 
accurately
Besides the deficit and the debt level, the fiscal 
stance is an indicator that is commonly used in 
analyses.16 It is designed to show whether fiscal 
policy in a given year has been eased or tight -
ened compared to the year before. It is often 
measured as the annual change in the cyclically 
adjusted primary balance,17 which is the fiscal 
balance (deficit or surplus) excluding interest 
expenditure and cyclical influences.… to Member

11 Deviations from this are the result of agreed contribu -

sake of simplicity, these will be disregarded below. The fi -
nancing shares could well change in the future, for in -
stance in connection with the introduction of a new tax 
harmonised across the EU. With regard to ESM debt, the 
current ESM capital key of the euro area Member States 
would apply. This is based primarily on a country’s share of 
euro area GDP . Population size and special clauses are also 
taken into account. See ESM (2020).
12 As usual, the allocated NGEU debt is expressed over 
GDP , while the distribution key is based on GNI. On bal -
ance, however, the ratios are largely identical for most 
countries. As is the case for the Maastricht debt level, the 
calculations here refer to gross debt. However, it should be 
borne in mind that some countries are in receipt of assis -
tance loans that are included in the national debt level and 
that capital has already been injected into the ESM. There 
are several ways to take this into account when fine- tuning 
the calculations.
13 In the repayment phase of EU debt (surplus at the Euro -
pean level), the budgetary rules would inversely oblige 
Member States to commit to a more frugal fiscal policy 
than would be the case when including the EU level.
14 There is no (marked) deficit in the ESM.
15 The actual ratio depends on the extent to which GDP 
differs from that of the base year 2019. Moreover, the re -
sults of some countries may differ (slightly) from the EU-  
wide figure. This is the case for Ireland, for instance. In the 
example figures selected, the deficit ratio rises by 0.2 per -
centage point less because Irish GDP is markedly higher 
than GNI.
16 See, for example, European Commission (2020e), p. 58, 
and European Fiscal Board (2020).
17 In other analyses, the fiscal stance is also measured as a 
change in the structural primary balance. This is calculated 
by excluding temporary policy measures as well as cyclical 
components and interest expenditure. In addition, both the 
change in the structural and in the cyclically adjusted pri -
mary balance ratio are often used as an indicator of fiscal 
consolidation or easing. In the European rules, this is meas -
ured by the change in the structural balance.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
December 2020  
42

The fiscal stance is also interpreted as an im -
pulse which emanates from fiscal policy to 
macroeconomic developments. The term “ex -
pansionary fiscal policy” is used, for example, 
when the cyclically adjusted primary balance 
falls compared to the previous year. This hap -
pens, for instance, if cyclically adjusted primary 
expenditure rises faster than cyclically adjusted 
revenue. It is then assumed that fiscal policy 
stimulates economic activity. Conversely, a rise 
in the cyclically adjusted primary balance tends 
to have a dampening impact on the economy. 
It may be the result of tax increases or spend -
ing cuts, for example.
The indicator is calculated on the basis of the 
national accounts balances for the relevant 
years. In the case of NGEU grants, however, 
the resulting picture is distorted in terms of the 
cyclical impulse. If, for instance, a Member 
State receives large NGEU grants for the first 
time in 2021, this will increase the national bal -
ance compared with the previous year (revenue 
and expenditure being otherwise unchanged). 
This means that the cyclically adjusted primary 
balance in 2021 will also be higher than in 
2020, and the fiscal stance for 2021 is meas -
ured as being restrictive. However, the grants 
received from abroad (the EU) do not have a 
dampening effect on national economic activ -
ity. This is because no domestic resources are 
withdrawn, as would be the case, for instance, 
if higher government revenue were the result 
of an income tax hike. If the NGEU grants de -
crease over time, national deficits will increase 
in themselves without triggering an expansion -
ary stimulus.
If the fiscal stance is to indicate how fiscal pol -
icy stimulates the domestic economy, the lo -
gical next step would be to exclude the NGEU 
grants received. For some countries, the differ -
ence from the unadjusted figure may be con -
siderable in some years. For example, the fiscal 
stance for Greece in 2021 – based on the 
above- mentioned assumptions (see the chart 
on p. 41) – is looser by around 1% of GDP after 
NGEU grants have been deducted. The corres -ponding figure for Germany, which is expected 
to receive relatively small grants, would amount 
to just 0.1% of GDP . For the euro area as a 
whole (like in the EU), the fiscal stance would 
therefore be 0.3 percentage point looser than 
in the absence of adjustment for the aggre -
gated national balances.
Obtaining the best possible indicator of the fis -
cal stance as an economic stimulus is not 
achieved solely by adjusting for NGEU grants. 
Member States’ other financial relationships 
with the European level can also skew the fiscal 
stance indicator. This is the case if a Member 
State’s net position with regard to the EU 
budget fluctuates strongly from year to year. In 
the past, this has been fairly significant for 
some Member States. In view of this, adjust -
ments would have to be made not only for 
NGEU grants received, but also for all revenue 
and expenditure vis- à- vis the EU budget.
An even more extensive and accurate approach 
would be to adjust for all the revenue and ex -
penditure flows of the country in question with 
the rest of the world. However, fluctuations be -
yond those in connection with the EU budget 
are often likely to be rather small. To reliably

“Fiscal stance” as an indicator of the fi  scal impulse 
on economic developments
Defi  nition and usage
The impact of fi  scal policy on macroeco-
nomic developments is a topic of interest 
for economic policy. An indicator often 
used for the fi  scal impulse is the change in 
the cyclically adjusted primary balance of 
general government (as defi  ned in the na-
tional accounts). Automatic stabilisers (cyc-
lically induced balances) and government 
interest expenditure are factored out of the 
general government fi  scal balance in the 
cyclically adjusted primary balance.1 The 
change in the cyclically adjusted primary 
balance is also known as the “fi  scal stance”. 
If the relevant government revenue falls, or 
if expenditure rises, the balance decreases, 
all else being equal. According to this defi  n-
ition, the fi  scal stance would then be de-
scribed as “expansionary” or “loose”. The 
opposite developments would be described 
as “restrictive” or “tight”. This indicator is 
frequently used for fi  scal policy analysis, 
which also forms the basis for policy recom-
mendations.
From an analytical perspective, the fi  scal 
stance is an indicator that provides an initial 
approximation, relative to the previous year, 
of the impulse of government fi  nances on 
overall economic developments. However, 
the concrete macroeconomic repercussions 
of this impulse can only be estimated with 
a  considerable degree of uncertainty. 
Amongst other things, they depend on 
which government revenue and expend-
iture categories change as well as on the 
circumstances. Furthermore, the cyclical de-
velopment of the government budget de-
ducted from the indicator can be evaluated 
differently depending on the estimation 
method used. In times of heightened un-
certainty in particular – such as the ongoing 
coronavirus crisis – this can result in signifi  -
cant differences with regard to the fi  scal 
stance indicated for a given country.Impact on gross domestic product 
dependent  on a variety of factors:
Underlying categories of revenue and 
expenditure
Identical changes in different categories of 
general government revenue and expend-
iture can have different effects on macro-
economic developments. Most analyses, for 
example, come to the conclusion that in-
creases in government expenditure gener-
ally provide greater stimulus to the economy 
than tax cuts of the equivalent volume.2 Fis-
cal policy can therefore have an impact on 
gross domestic product (GDP) even if the fi  s-
cal stance indicator reports neutrality.
In this context, the impact of individual cat-
egories is often subject to debate. The esti-
mation is dependent on both the exact spe-
cifi  cations of the analyses and the prevailing 
circumstances. For example, it is diffi   cult to 
gauge how assistance for banks or for en-
terprises that were closed for a time due to 
the pandemic stabilises economic activity 
over the short term.
By contrast, payment fl  ows with other 
countries mostly have a minimal impact on 
domestic economic developments. A strong 
1 To a large extent, the fi  scal stance is a refl  ection of 
measures actively taken by general government (such 
as tax increases or expansions in investment). For this 
reason, it is often seen as a yardstick for the active 
loosening or tightening of fi  scal policy. However, other 
infl  uencing factors can also shape the fi  scal stance 
(such as rising pension expenditure due to a growing 
number of pensioners). The fi  scal stance also captures 
temporary factors that only have an impact on the bal-
ances for a limited period of time. These may include 
fi  scal policy measures (e.g. a one- off child bonus) as 
well as factors outside the control of fi  scal policy, such 
as tax refunds as a result of court rulings. Temporary 
infl  uencing factors have neither a positive nor negative 
impact on the fi  scal outlook over the long term. In-
stead, their impact on macroeconomic developments 
depends on the specifi  c circumstances in each case.
2 See Gechert (2015).Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
December 2020  
44

case can be made, then, for adjusting the 
fi  scal stance indicator for these payment 
fl  ows if they fl  uctuate signifi  cantly over time 
(see also p. 46).
Timing inconsistencies
Timing inconsistencies also play a key role 
in the impact of fi  scal policy on GDP . For 
instance, a fi  scal policy impulse occurring 
today often infl  uences macroeconomic de-
velopments only after a certain amount of 
time. A reduction in income tax could, for 
example, be refl  ected in a lagged response 
of private consumption – especially if con-
sumers are initially uncertain about their in-
dividual relief. On the other hand, the im-
pulse could also take effect before the pay-
ment fl  ows, for example if enterprises are 
provided with more generous depreciation 
allowances.
Cyclical conditions
Depending on the underlying cyclical condi-
tions, a fi  scal policy impulse can have differ-
ent effects. For example, it is generally likely 
to have a stronger impact on real GDP if 
production capacity is not fully utilised. In 
the event of overutilisation, by contrast, a 
fi  scal policy impulse would instead lead 
more to price infl  ation than to greater real 
growth. The monetary policy response is 
also important: in general, an opposing re-
action is often likely (given a non- binding 
zero lower bound on interest rates), as an 
expansionary fi  scal policy impulse causes in-
fl  ation to rise, all else being equal. If this 
dampening effect does not materialise, the 
fi  scal policy impulse has a stronger impact.
Other underlying economic conditions
In addition, other, country- specifi  c factors 
can have an infl  uence on the impact of a fi  s-
cal policy impulse.3 For example, an expan-
sionary impulse will probably be less effective 
if government solvency is subject to doubt. 
Under such circumstances, private invest-
ment, amongst other things, is hindered by potentially rising risk premia that spill over 
into the private sector as well as by height-
ened uncertainty overall.4 An economy with 
a high import ratio would also be likely to 
show a weaker response to a fi  scal policy im-
pulse than a more closed economy. Further-
more, propensity to save among the general 
public infl  uences the effects of the impulse. 
For example, for populations with high sav-
ing ratios, additional disposable income re-
sulting from an expansionary impulse only 
leads to a limited rise in consumption.
Formation of expectations
Last but not least, expectations play a role. 
Amongst other things, these are infl  uenced 
by communication. For example, if the an-
nouncement that a reduction in value added 
tax will be limited in time is considered cred-
ible, households will expect prices to rise 
again at a later point in time and bring their 
consumption forward accordingly. How-
ever, if new government borrowing is inter-
preted primarily as an indication that the 
future tax burden will be heavier, an in-
tended expansionary impact can fi  zzle out 
in the form of additional private saving.
Conclusion: Indicator should be inter-
preted with a high degree of caution
The “fi  scal stance” indicator provides a 
broad impression of the impulses of fi  scal 
policy on short- term economic develop-
ments. The informative value of the indica-
tor can be improved by adjusting it for cat-
egories of revenue and expenditure that 
fl  uctuate more strongly and that clearly 
have only a limited infl  uence on the econ-
omy. These can include general government 
payments to and from abroad. Beyond this, 
however, the impact of fi  scal policy on 
macroeconomic developments still depends 
on a number of additional factors. The indi-
cator should therefore be interpreted with 
caution.
3 See Ilzetzki et al. (2013).
4 See Blanchard and Zettelmeyer (2018).Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
December 2020  
45

however, this would, for its part, increase com -
putational complexity. In any case, the fiscal 
stance indicator should generally be interpreted 
with caution (see the box on pp. 44 f.).
Conclusion
Fiscal policy has been playing a significant sta -
bilising role during the coronavirus crisis. Be -
sides national measures, European assistance 
mechanisms have been set up at the price of 
accumulating large- scale European debt and 
deficits. These are not usually envisaged, and 
are therefore also only intended to be tempor -
ary.
The new dimension which European debt and 
deficits have taken on means that they need to 
be taken into account in fiscal analyses. Exist -
ing national indicators (such as the Maastricht 
deficit or Maastricht debt) do not capture Euro -
pean debt and deficits and will therefore no 
longer be fit for purpose in the future. This 
presents a number of risks, one being that the resulting burdens might go unnoticed. That 
could increase the incentive to shift ever more 
debt from the national level to the European 
level, and propensity to borrow could increase.
In terms of fiscal and economic policy analysis, 
it is important for government activities at the 
European level to be statistically recorded in a 
comprehensible manner using relevant national 
accounts data. This has not been the case so 
far and should form part of the final decisions. 
One priority should be timely disclosure of the 
Maastricht debt and fiscal balance at the Euro -
pean level. This would allow European deficits 
and debt to be allocated to the Member States 
for the purposes of economic and fiscal policy 
analysis. They should also be taken into ac -
count in the fiscal rules. Moreover, the fiscal 
stance indicators for the Member States and 
the EU aggregate as well as for the euro area 
as a whole could be compiled and presented in 
a more suitable manner. This would place asso -
ciated policy recommendations on a sounder 
footing, for example.Extensive Euro -

Risk Reduction Act – the national 
 implementation of the European banking 
package
The European banking package contains further essential regulatory provisions designed to eradi -
cate the regulatory gaps and deficiencies identified in the aftermath of the financial crisis and to 
buttress the resilience of the European banking sector overall. It is precisely in times such as the 
current COVID-  19 pandemic where stringent regulation pays off because institutions with a sound 
capital base are better able to withstand the capital burden imposed by the pandemic. Within the 
broader context of the advancement of the banking union, the banking package should be 
regarded as a further measure to reduce risks in the banking sector. The banking package also 
envisages administrative relief for small, non- complex institutions without exempting them from 
quantitative requirements – a development which the Bundesbank had a major role in driving 
forward and, given the growing complexity of banking regulation and the increasing cost of com -
pliance, an important step towards proportionate and targeted regulation.
The Risk Reduction Act (Risikoreduzierungsgesetz) complements directly applicable European pro -
visions by transposing into German law the provisions of the Capital Requirements Directive 
(CRD V) and the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD II) contained in the banking pack -
age. This has necessitated amendments not only to national legislation but also to national statu -
tory orders. Implementation in the Risk Reduction Act is guided by European standards, which, in 
keeping with the spirit of broad harmonisation within the European Union (EU), leaves little to no 
discretionary scope. This approach should be welcomed as a move to create a level playing field 
within the EU. The discretionary scope was utilised only with respect to the unique features of the 
German banking market and to the extent explicitly granted to Member States. The fact that Ger -
man legislators used the scope afforded via the Risk Reduction Act to incorporate relief for fac -
toring and financial leasing institutions appears appropriate against the backdrop of the general 
debate on proportionality.
Though the banking package and its transposition by way of the Risk Reduction Act represent the 
regulatory implementation of further key elements of the Basel III framework in the EU and 
national legislation, it is still not the final item on the post- financial- crisis agenda. One final piece 
of the jigsaw puzzle is implementation of the package of Basel III reforms from the end of 2017, 
even if the timeline has been moved back one year owing to the COVID-  19 pandemic. Irrespective 
of the delay, it is important that these standards be implemented consistently and fully. In keeping 
with the spirit of reliable multilateral cooperation, the current turmoil caused by COVID-  19 should 
not be used to water down the agreed standards during the implementation process. This would 
tilt the global playing field and thus create undesirable regulatory arbitrage opportunities. At the 
European level, the key is to adhere to the agenda of further risk reduction. This includes not only 
the regulatory treatment of sovereign bonds but also the actual achievement of the target require -
ments for sufficient loss-absorbing capacity available in a resolution event.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
What is known as the “banking package” was 
promulgated in the Official Journal of the Euro -
pean Union on 7  June 2019.1 The banking 
package is a further key step towards eradicat -
ing the regulatory gaps and weaknesses identi -
fied in the financial crisis with the goal of 
strengthening the resilience and stability of the 
European banking sector. It therefore encom -
passes numerous amendments to the Capital 
Requirements Regulation (CRR),2 the Capital 
Requirements Directive (CRD),3 the Bank Recov -
ery and Resolution Directive (BRRD)4 and 
the  Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation 
(SRMR).5,6 Whereas the amended EU regula -
tions (CRR and SRMR) are directly applicable in 
the EU Member States, the directives (CRD and 
BRRD) first need to be transposed into national 
law. In Germany, this is being accomplished 
through the Risk Reduction Act (Risikoreduzie -
rungsgesetz) ,7 most of which will enter into 
force at the end of 2020.8
The Risk Reduction Act is an omnibus act and 
envisages, in particular, amendments to the 
Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz)  and the Act 
on the Recovery and Resolution of Institutions 
and Financial Groups (Gesetz zur Sanierung 
und Abwicklung von Instituten und Finanz -
gruppen). Alongside the necessary implemen -
tation of EU requirements, further amendments 
which appeared appropriate in terms of timing 
and subject matter are also included.
Key amendments to the 
Banking Act
Approval requirement 
for (mixed) financial holding 
companies
Financial holding companies9 and mixed finan -
cial holding companies10 can be parents of 
banking groups for which the application of 
supervisory requirements at the consolidated 
level is mandatory. However, the supervised in -stitutions controlled by such a holding com -
pany cannot always ensure compliance with 
the requirements at the consolidated level 
throughout the group. Therefore, the new Sec -
tion 2f of the Banking Act11 introduces an ap -
proval requirement for (mixed) (EU) parent fi -
nancial holding companies of a group respon -
sible for meeting prudential requirements at 
the group level, whilst at the same time an ob -
ligation is imposed on the (mixed) financial 
holding company itself to ensure compliance 
with prudential requirements on a consolidated 
basis. Section 2f of the Banking Act transposes 
the European provision set out in Article 21a of 
CRD V. The new rule also defines the informa -
tion and documentation to be submitted to the 
consolidating supervisor, i.e. the competent au -
thority for the group under the approval pro -
cedure. The use of the term “competent au -
thority” here and elsewhere in the Banking Act 
illustrates that the authority can be either the 
ECB or the Federal Financial Supervisory Au -
thority (BaFin). For approval to be granted, it is 
necessary, in particular, for the internal arrange -
ments and distribution of tasks within the 
group to be adequate for the purpose of com -
plying with the Banking Act and CRR on a con -
solidated or sub- consolidated basis and to be 
effective to coordinate all subsidiaries, prevent 
conflicts and enforce policies set by the parent 
throughout the group. The competent author -

ity must notify the applicant of the decision to 
grant or refuse approval within six months of 
receipt of the application.
There are individual cases in which approval is 
not necessary, if, amongst other things, the fi -
nancial holding company’s principal activity is 
to acquire and maintain holdings in subsidiaries 
and a CRR credit institution is responsible for 
ensuring compliance with prudential require -
ments on a consolidated basis. The competent 
authority shall monitor compliance with the cri -
teria for approval or exemption on an ongoing 
basis.
Responsibility for supervision 
on a consolidated basis
As a complement to the introduction of an ap -
proval requirement for (mixed) financial holding 
companies, the new Section 8b of the Banking 
Act, which transposes Article 111 of CRD V into 
German law, reorganises responsibilities for the 
supervision of groups of institutions or financial 
holding groups on a consolidated basis. The re -
organisation of supervisory responsibilities at 
the European level will enhance the role of 
banking supervision relative to securities super -
vision. In future, once a group contains at least 
one credit institution, the competent authority 
for banking supervision is always to assume re -
sponsibility for the consolidated supervision of 
that group. In addition, the new rules increas -
ingly allocate responsibility for consolidated 
supervision to the competent authority that 
supervises, at an individual level, the largest 
part of the group in terms of total assets. It is 
therefore possible that, going forward, the 
competent authority which supervises the con -
solidating entity as defined in Section 10 of the 
Banking Act12 will no longer automatically be 
responsible for consolidated supervision, either. 
Nonetheless, Section 8c of the Banking Act 
allows the competent authorities, in particular 
cases and by common agreement, to deviate 
from the assignment of responsibility pre -
scribed by law.Establishment of an inter -
mediate EU parent undertaking 
in the case of third- country 
parent undertakings
Section 2g of the Banking Act introduces a re -
quirement that certain third- country banking 
groups13 establish an intermediate EU parent 
undertaking (IPU). This requirement covers 
third- country banking groups that have at least 
two subsidiary institutions established in the EU 
and whose assets (including those of legally 
dependent branches) within the EU exceed a 
threshold of €40 billion. The activities of all EU 
subsidiary institutions of the third- country 
banking group are to be supervised on a con -
solidated basis under this newly established IPU 
in the EU. The objective is to make it easier to 
supervise third- country banking groups in the 
EU as well as to potentially apply resolution re -
gimes to their EU activities.
On a case- by- case basis, supervisors may ap -
prove structures with two IPUs. This would be 
possible, in particular, in those cases where the 
establishment of a single IPU would violate the 
third country’s ringfencing rules14 or if the reso -
lution authorities believe that consolidation of 
all business activities under a single intermedi -
ate EU parent would impair resolvability. For 
those third- country banking groups which, as 
at 27  June 2019, had been represented by 
more than one institution in the EU and whose 
assets within the EU as at that date exceeded 
€40 billion, the Banking Act provides for an ex -
tended transition period ending on 30 Decem -
ber 2023. All other affected third- country 
banking groups must implement the require -New rules

group has not been approved, a subordinated institution

tion instead.

ment when the national implementation enters 
into force on 29 December 2020.
Pillar 2
CRD V clarified a number of points relating to 
the supervisory review and evaluation process 
(SREP) as well as the supervisory measures 
based on it. These have been carried over to 
the Banking Act via the Risk Reduction Act.
The expanded rules governing the additional 
own funds requirements (Pillar 2 requirement, 
or P2R) have been consolidated in Section 6c of 
the Banking Act, which also contains the new 
rule on the quality of the own funds needed to 
meet the additional own funds requirements. 
Under the new rules, this capital requirement 
– in keeping with the minimum capital require -
ments under Pillar 1 – no longer has to be met 
exclusively with common equity tier 1 (CET1) 
capital.
The basis for the guidance on additional own 
funds (Pillar 2 guidance, or P2G) is transposed 
by Section 6d of the Banking Act. This add -
itional capital buffer is intended to allow insti -
tutions to cover losses incurred in day- to- day 
business operations during stress periods – one 
example being the current COVID-  19 situ -
ation – without breaching prudential minimum 
capital requirements. In order for this stress 
buffer to function properly, it makes sense to 
meet this guidance on additional own funds 
using CET1 capital.
For the majority of German institutions, interest 
rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) is the 
most significant risk for which there is no provi -
sion for own funds requirements under Pillar 1. 
In line with the European requirement, two in -
dicators are being introduced for assessing the 
materiality and, thus, the necessity of add -
itional own funds requirements for IRRBB. Ac -
cordingly, interest rate risk is regarded as ma -
terial, in particular, if there is a decline in the 
economic value of equity of more than 15% of Expanded SREP

defi  nition of the term 
 “signifi  cant institution” 
in the Banking Act for the 
purposes of  remuneration 
and  corporate governance
For the purposes of regulating remuner-
ation and in connection with the require-
ments set out in Sections 25c and 25d of 
the Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz) for 
management bodies and administrative or 
supervisory bodies, a standard defi  nition 
of the term “signifi  cant institution” is 
being introduced in Section 1(3c) of the 
Banking Act. According to this defi  nition, 
an institution shall be signifi  cant if its total 
assets exceed €15 billion on average over 
the respective reporting dates of the pre-
ceding four completed fi  nancial years. Fur-
thermore, pursuant to Section 1(3c) of the 
Banking Act, the following institutions 
shall always be deemed to be signifi  cant:
– institutions which meet one of the con-
ditions pursuant to Article 6(4) subpar-
agraph 2 of the SSM Regulation;1,2
– institutions categorised as having the 
potential to pose a systemic threat 
within the meaning of Section 12 of 
the Banking Act;
– fi  nancial trading institutions within the 
meaning of Section 25f(1) of the Bank-
ing Act.

signifi  cant if, fi  rst, the total value of its assets ex-
ceeds €30 billion; second, the ratio of its total 
assets over national GDP exceeds 20% (only ap-
plies where the total value of an institution’s 
assets exceeds €5 billion); or third, following a no-
tifi  cation by its national competent authority that 
it considers such an institution of signifi  cant rele-
vance with regard to the domestic economy, the 
ECB takes a decision confi  rming such signifi  cance.Deutsche Bundesbank

Supervision of promotional banks
Since the entry into force of the Capital Re-
quirements Regulation (CRR) II on 27 June 
2019, Germany’s 14 legally independent 
promotional banks have no longer been 
CRR credit institutions. By virtue of the 
amendment to Article 2(5) point (5) of the 
Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) in 
CRD V, they have been specifi  cally exempted 
from the scope of EU banking regulation. 
For this reason, they have since returned to 
supervision at a solely national level, i.e. by 
the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority 
(BaFin) and the Bundesbank. As they are no 
longer CRR credit institutions, they also no 
longer fall within the scope of the Single 
Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) and are 
therefore no longer subject to supervision 
under the SSM. There was no immediate 
need for German legislators to act, given 
that the promotional banks concerned are 
credit institutions within the meaning of the 
Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz). The Euro-
pean supervisory rules, fi  rst and foremost 
the CRR and CRD, still generally apply to 
these credit institutions via a reference to 
that effect in Section 1a of the Banking Act. 
The Risk Reduction Act (Risikoreduzierungs-
gesetz) stipulates that the reporting require-
ments set out in the ECB Regulation on the 
reporting of supervisory fi  nancial informa-
tion1 also apply to promotional banks as 
non- CRR credit institutions. Additionally, 
the insertion of Section 12 of the Banking 
Act ensures that these promotional banks 
can also be classifi  ed as institutions posing 
a potential systemic threat (PSIs). An institu-
tion’s signifi  cance relative to the population of all institutions in Germany is used as the 
basis for assessing its systemic importance. 
The new Section 12 of the Banking Act 
makes it possible for promotional banks to 
be taken into account as part of the popu-
lation for determining the systemic import-
ance of institutions in Germany in the con-
text of the methodology applied by BaFin 
and the Bundesbank (PSI method).
In the area of remuneration regulation, a 
different balance sheet threshold applies to 
promotional institutions with respect to 
their classifi  cation as signifi  cant institutions: 
they are only considered signifi  cant if the 
total value of their assets exceeds €70 bil-
lion.2 Only then do they have to comply 
with the special requirements of the Remu-
neration Regulation for Institutions (Insti-

the preceding four fi  nancial years. As a general rule, a

Tier 1 capital in any of the six supervisory inter -
est rate shock scenarios or a large decline in 
net interest income in any of the two supervis -
ory scenarios.How these indicators are going to work in 
practice will be enshrined in regulatory tech -
nical standards (RTS), which are mandated by 
CRD V and are yet to be drawn up by the Euro -
pean Banking Authority (EBA). This challenging 
work for the EBA involving, for example, the 
development of an earnings- based indicator 
that breaks new ground in regulatory terms, 
will therefore not be completed before 2022. 
Owing to the fact that the provision in the 
Banking Act is linked to the new indicators and 
the RTS, these requirements of the Banking Act 
will not yet be applied until the RTS enter into 
force after they are adopted in the form of a 
Regulation by the European Commission.
The Bundesbank welcomes the introduction of 
supervisory indicators covering both an eco -
nomic value and earnings- based perspective 
along the lines of the Minimum Requirements 
for Risk Management (MaRisk). Regulatory 
ratios can give no more than an indication of 
the risk at an individual institution, however. No automatic 
application of 
additional own 
funds require -
ments for IRRBBtutsvergütungsverordnung), whereas pro-
motional banks with total assets below this 
value still only have to meet the general re-
quirements. As a result, the regulation of 
remuneration for promotional banks that 
has so far effectively been in place will con-
tinue.
Under the Risk Reduction Act, the Banking 
Act will now exempt promotional banks 
from disclosure requirements. The main rea-
son for this is presumably that the decisive 
factor for buyers of fi  nancial instruments 
when making their purchases is likely to pri-
marily be the explicit guarantee provided by 
the public sector rather than the promo-
tional bank’s risk assessment. The market- 
disciplining effect induced by disclosure 
would thus be redundant.
Overall, it is a welcome development that 
promotional banks will continue to be sub-ject to a level of supervision comparable to 
the one provided under EU banking super-
vision law. Moreover, the basic approach of 
the Banking Act, according to which all 
credit institutions within the meaning of the 
Banking Act are subject to the same rules, is 
not being called into question.Deutsche Bundesbank

Therefore, a positive feature to be highlighted 
is that there is no provision for an automatic 
link between overstepping the indicators’ 
threshold values and additional own funds re -
quirements. Seen in that light, decisions on 
additional own funds requirements for IRRBB 
will continue to be made with due consider -
ation given to institution- specific aspects.
Leverage ratio
The Pillar 2 framework for an institution- specific 
risk- based capital requirement is now also 
being applied to the non- risk- weighted lever -
age ratio. As the European requirements do 
not provide for any explicit national discretion -
ary leeway for legislators regarding the new re -
quirements for the leverage ratio, their imple -
mentation in the Banking Act will closely follow 
the wording of the European regulations.
One particular feature to be highlighted is that 
there will be supervisory discretion with the 
possibility –  mirroring the risk- based frame -
work – of supplementing the 3% minimum re -
quirement for the leverage ratio (LR) under Pil -
lar 115 – which will be binding as of 28 June 
2021 – with additional own funds requirements 
and guidance. The additional own funds re -
quirement (LR Pillar 2 requirement, or LR- P2R) is 
calculated by the supervisory authorities as part 
of the SREP for an individual institution espe -
cially for uncovered or inadequately covered 
risks arising from excessive leverage. By con -
trast, the own funds guidance (LR Pillar 2 guid -
ance, or LR- P2G) is calculated on the basis of 
supervisory stress tests. This additional own 
funds guidance is designed to enable institu -
tions to cover losses in crisis situations without 
first eating into other own funds items. Like the 
requirements of CRD V, national legislation, 
too, envisages that own funds used to meet 
LR- P2R and LR- P2G cannot be used to fulfil 
other leverage ratio own funds requirements.
Another key change is the introduction of more 
detailed requirements regarding the application of the leverage ratio buffer. This buffer is to be 
maintained by global systemically important in -
stitutions (G-  SIIs) from 2023 and amounts to 
50% of the risk- based G-  SII capital buffer.16 In 
particular, the national legislation will, in fu -
ture, contain requirements regarding the (re -
stricted) permissibility of distributions if the buf -
fer requirement is not fulfilled, with the details 
being regulated by statutory order (Solvency 
Regulation – Solvabilitätsverordnung ). Further -
more, for cases where the buffer requirement

visions with regard to the necessity of and pro -
cedure for preparing a capital conservation 
plan that is intended to ensure (renewed) com -
pliance with the requirement within an appro -
priate time period.
The wholesale transposition of the CRD V re-
quirements into national law finalises the im -
plementation of the LR framework as a back -
stop for the risk- based framework at the na -
tional level, too. The elements which this intro -
duces are to be welcomed from a supervisory 
perspective, as they create consistency with the 
existing regulatory possibility of setting tar -
geted own funds requirements or guidance for 
an individual institution in the risk- based frame -
work. Seen in that light, they incorporate a 
tried and tested concept into the non- risk- 
based framework.
Exclusion rules on the use of 
CET1 capital
In fulfilling a capital buffer requirement, institu -
tions are not allowed to use any CET1 capital 
that is needed to back other risk- based capital 
requirements, such as the minimum capital re -
quirements and bank- specific add- ons or one 
of the other capital buffers. This provision is National imple -

now regulated centrally in the new Section 10b 
of the Banking Act. This incorporates a tech -
nical amendment from CRD V which merges 
the individual provisions concerning the capital 
buffers and places them in a central position. 
Listing the relevant capital requirements in Sec -
tion 10b of the Banking Act does not imply a 
sequence or “stacking order” in which the indi -
vidual requirements are to be fulfilled. Rather, it 
makes clear that there must be no multiple use 
of CET1 capital to back risk- based capital re -
quirements.
Amendment of provisions 
 relating to loans to related 
parties
The changes in the provisions relating to loans 
to related parties in Section 15 of the Banking 
Act are due to an amendment of Article 88(1) 
of CRD and to the Basel Core Principles for Ef -
fective Banking Supervision.17 In line with the 
amended European provisions, there is now a 
wider group of persons to whom the special 
decision- making requirements pursuant to Sec -
tion 15 of the Banking Act are applicable. In 
future, loans to a parent or the adult children 
of a member of the management board or of 
the supervisory board will also require approval 
from the management board and the supervis -
ory board of the institution. This amendment 
originates from the Basel Core Principles for Ef -
fective Banking Supervision, according to which 
adult children and parents are also to be under -
stood as “close family members”. Furthermore, 
as part of its 2016 Financial Sector Assessment 
Program (FSAP) of Germany, the International 
Monetary Fund made the criticism that persons 
with potential conflicts of interest were not ex -
cluded from decision- making on granting re -
lated party loans. Furthermore, the Fund main -
tained that the existing provisions of Section 15 
of the Banking Act were inadequate because 
they fail to take into account conflicts of inter -
est that can arise in service contracts, asset pur -
chases and sales, and construction contracts or 
the write- offs of exposures. These shortcom -ings will be remedied with the Risk Reduction 
Act.
Remuneration
The new European regulations necessitate 
changes in the national remuneration rules, in -
cluding in relation to the proportional applica -
tion of specific remuneration requirements as 
well as the need for gender- neutral remuner -
ation systems.
The recast uniform definition of significant in -
stitutions in the Risk Reduction Act takes due 
account of the approach prescribed in CRD V, 
where institutions above a given balance sheet 
threshold may not be exempted from ex post 
risk adjustment.18 The European rules in this re -
gard set a general proportionality threshold of 
€5 billion for total assets on a four- year aver -
age. In Germany, however, legislators have 
made full use of the option contained in CRD V 
which allows Member States to raise the 
threshold to up to €15 billion, From the Bun -
desbank’s perspective, this makes it possible to 
take due account of conditions in the German 
banking market.
At the same time, all CRR institutions now have 
to identify risk takers. So far, only significant 
CRR institutions have had to do this. Only 
“light- touch” risk taker identification is required 
of non- significant CRR institutions. This applies 
only to members of the management board 
and members of the administrative or supervis -
ory board – who, by law, are necessarily cat -
egorised as risk takers – as well as certain other 
groups of employees in management pos -Additional provi -

18 In CRD V, exemption from ex post risk adjustment expli -
citly covers the rules on the pro rata pay- out of variable 
remuneration in instruments as well as a pro rata deferral 
over a number of years. According to the draft amendment 
to the Remuneration Regulation for Institutions (Instituts -
vergütungsverordnung)  published by BaFin, there is also to 
be an exemption with regard to the requirement for the ex 
post contraction of variable remuneration components 
through malus and clawback arrangements.Deutsche Bundesbank

itions.19 The further, more detailed examination 
of additional criteria for identifying members of 
staff whose professional activities have a ma -
terial impact on the risk profile pursuant to 
Delegated Regulation (EU) No 604/ 2014 as last 
amended20 is to be performed only by signifi -
cant institutions. For institutions which are not 
CRR institutions, no identification of risk takers 
is necessary, as hitherto, unless they are 
deemed to be significant.
The principle of gender- neutral remuneration 
for members of the administrative or supervis -
ory board is being incorporated in the new Sec -
tion 25d(5) of the Banking Act. Remuneration 
reporting requirements will also be expanded 
to include information on the gender pay gap. 
Details of this will only be available after 
amendments of the relevant EBA Guidelines.
In tandem with the implementation of the re -
muneration requirements in the Banking Act, 
amendments to the Remuneration Regulation 
for Institutions will be necessary. This concerns 
changes, for example, to the scope of applica -
tion, the minimum length of the deferral period 
and the regulations for groups as well as the 
incorporation of the need for gender- neutral 
remuneration for employees and members of 
the management board.
Corporate governance
In the area of corporate governance, the imple -
mentation of the European banking package 
has brought clarification of certain points, 
granted relief measures and enshrined current 
supervisory practices in law.
Under current law, the primary responsibility 
for both the initial and ongoing suitability of 
members of the management body already lies 
with the institutions. The Banking Act therefore 
now makes it clear that new facts which have 
a considerable impact on the initial “fit and 
proper” assessment also have to be notified by 
the institutions without undue delay as soon as they become known. In the notification pro -
cedure for new members of the management 
board, the outcome of the “fit and proper” as -
sessment is also to be communicated by the 
notifying reporting institution in future.
Furthermore, as a result of the Risk Reduction 
Act, the Banking Act stipulates that members 
of the management board should, collectively, 
possess an appropriately broad range of know -
ledge, skills and experience that allows them to 
understand the institution’s activities, including 
the main risks. As before, each individual mem -
ber of the management board shall also have 
the knowledge, skills and experience necessary 
for fulfilling their respective tasks.
Relief is provided for institutions at subordin -
ated level within a group which, on an individ -
ual basis, do not meet the definition of a sig -
nificant institution pursuant to Section 1(3c) of 
the Banking Act. Depending on the size, in -
ternal organisation and the nature, scope, 
complexity and riskiness of the institution’s ac -
tivities, they can decide in future on (not) set -
ting up the committees mentioned in the Bank -
ing Act.
Further relief measures are envisaged with re -
gard to the maximum number of directorships. 
For one thing, the existing narrow concept of a 
“group of institutions” will be brought into line 
with the newly introduced definition of a 
“group” in the CRR. This means that, in future, 
directorships can be added up and counted as 
a single directorship if they are exercised within 
a single group of undertakings, of which at 
least one is an institution and the other under -Gender- neutral

20 Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 604/ 2014 
prescribes qualitative and quantitative criteria for determin -
ing risk takers at institutions. It was revised by the EBA in 
parallel with the national implementation of CRD V,  sent to 
the European Commission and published ( https://eba.  
europa.eu/eba-publishes-revised-standards-identify-staff-  
material-impact-institution%E2%80%99s-risk-profile ). It 
will enter into force only upon adoption by the European 
Commission and subsequent publication in the Official 
Journal of the European Union.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
December 2020  
57

takings belong to the same consolidated group. 
Furthermore, directorships as a member of the 
management board and as a member of the 
administrative or supervisory board within a 
group are not to be counted separately in fu -
ture but together as a single management 
board directorship. As this brings the counting 
of directorships into line with the practice in 
other SSM Member States, this long due 
change is to be welcomed in terms of harmon -
isation. For members of the management body 
of German institutions, this amendment is also 
likely to make it considerably easier for them to 
hold directorships. However, an additional ad -
ministrative or supervisory board directorship 
approved in an individual case by the supervis -
ory authority may be accepted only after it has 
been approved.
For the purpose of harmonisation within the 
SSM, a new legal basis is being created for 
interviews to assess the suitability criteria con -
ducted by the supervisory authority.21 Further -
more, there is now an explicit legal basis for 
reprimanding members of the management 
board.22
Transitional arrangement 
for securities trading firms
In the transitional provisions, Section 64(3) of 
the Banking Act now makes clear that what 
have thus far been referred to as securities 
trading firms, which, from 26 June 2021, will 
be subject to the prudential regime for invest -
ment firms,23 will not be governed by the re -
quirements of CRD V during the transitional 
period of six months following the entry into 
force of the Risk Reduction Act. With the ex -
ception of the requirement to set up an IPU 
under Section 2g of the Banking Act, the provi -
sions of the Banking Act as last amended be -
fore the entry into force of the Risk Reduction 
Act shall continue to apply.Further amendments to the 
Banking Act
The amendments relating to the macropruden -
tial instruments represent a further essential 
component of CRD  V and thus also of its na -
tional transposition into the Banking Act.24 
These instruments are now distinguished more 
clearly from the microprudential instruments; 
overlaps between the macroprudential buffers 
are being adjusted. Their implementation in 
Sections 10c to 10i of the Banking Act is in line 
with European requirements.
Furthermore, the Risk Reduction Act introduces 
a number of editorial changes required by the 
substance or context. For example, the word -
ing of Section 45 of the Banking Act, which 
governs measures to improve the adequacy of 
own funds and liquidity, has been partly recast. 
This includes the clarification that the supervis -
ory authority is able to take early measures to 
effectively avert a potential emergency situ -
ation. This is designed to define more clearly 
their difference from the early intervention 
measures contained in the Act on the Recovery 
and Resolution of Institutions and Financial 
Groups. The use of the term “supervisory au -
thority” now also makes clear that the ECB is 
able to directly apply these powers under the 
Banking Act in relation to the German institu -
tions which are under direct ECB supervision.
Accompanying amendments

package, amendments to national legislation 
must also be accompanied by changes to exist -Further changes

ing statutory orders, notably the Regulation 
Governing Large Exposures and Loans of €1 Mil -
lion or More ( Großkredit- und Millionenkredit -
verordnung  – GroMiKV), the Solvency Regula -
tion and the Remuneration Regulation for Insti -
tutions. In some cases, changes are necessitated 
as a direct result of CRR II or CRD V, and in other 
cases they are required as a consequence of 
amendments made to the Banking Act. For this 
reason, BaFin held public consultations on five 
pieces of draft amending regulations between 
12  November 2020 and 4  December 2020.25 
Due to the later entry into force of the leverage 
ratio buffer with effect from 1 January 2023, it 
was deemed necessary to draft two separate 
amending regulations in each case for the Solv -
ency Regulation and the Remuneration Regula -
tion for Institutions. The Fourth Regulation 
Amending the Solvency Regulation separately 
transposes into national law details on the calcu -
lation of G-  SIIs’ maximum distributable amount, 
such amount depending on the degree to which 
the leverage ratio buffer requirement is met.
The regulation amending the Regulation Gov -
erning Large Exposures and Loans of €1 Million 
or More is scheduled to enter into force on 
28 June 2021, and the other amending regula -
tions26 are not expected to enter into force this 
year either.
Adjustments to national 
bank resolution law
On the whole, the Risk Reduction Act’s imple -
mentation of bank resolution law sticks very 
closely to the wording of BRRD II and thus also 
of SRMR.
Minimum requirement for own 
funds and eligible  liabilities 
(MREL)
The new and stricter rules added to bank reso -
lution law as a result of the banking package27 
and its national implementation through the Risk Reduction Act will enhance the resolvability of in -
stitutions overall. This will be achieved primarily 
through the amended rules on creating sufficient 
loss-absorbing capacity in order to reduce the risk 
of institutions seeking public financial support.
Consistent with the TLAC standard,28 a statu -
tory minimum MREL requirement is being intro -
duced for G-  SIIs for which the calibration par -
ameters are based on two variables: a risk- based 
ratio based on risk- weighted assets (RWAs) and 
the non- risk- based ratio based on the leverage 
ratio exposure measure (LRE). Moreover, Euro -
pean legislators have also decided to widen the 
group of banks to which a statutory minimum 
MREL requirement is applicable beyond G-  SIIs 
to include “top- tier” banks. This new category 
of top- tier banks includes banks which are not 
G- SIIs but have total assets above €100 billion. 
In addition, the resolution authority can classify 
institutions with total assets lower than €100 
billion as top- tier banks if it assesses them as 
posing a systemic risk in the event of their fail -
ure (“fishing option”). In addition, a further 
statutory minimum MREL requirement of 8% of 
total liabilities and own funds (TLOF) has been 
introduced for G-  SIIs and top- tier banks, effect -
ive from January 2024. This ensures consistency 
with the BRRD requirement that losses totalling 
no less than 8% of TLOF shall be met by share -
holders and subordinated creditors before 
losses can potentially be covered by the Single 
Resolution Fund (SRF).29 For G-  SIIs and top- tier 
banks, the statutory minimum MREL require -
ment should generally be met with subordin -
ated MREL instruments.30 For the other banks,

Eased requirements for factoring and fi  nancial leasing 
 institutions
Asset- leasing vehicles for multiple leased 
assets now join asset- leasing vehicles for 
single leased assets in being exempt from 
the authorisation requirement. These are 
undertakings whose only fi  nancial service is 
fi  nancial leasing where they act as asset- 
leasing vehicles for one or multiple leased 
assets of a single lessee. From a risk per-
spective, it is appropriate to subject asset- 
leasing vehicles for multiple leased assets, 
which fi  nance and transfer to a particular 
lessee ownership of leased assets, to the 
same regulatory treatment as asset- leasing 
vehicles for single leased assets, which fi  -
nance and transfer to a particular lessee 
ownership of just a single leased asset. This 
is because, besides a management board, 
neither type of asset- leasing vehicle nor-
mally has any staff of its own. An asset- 
leasing vehicle for multiple leased assets 
holds only a small number of large- volume 
leased assets in order to shield against risk, 
but – as with asset- leasing vehicles for sin-
gle leased assets  – it is managed by one 
managing leasing company. Another key 
prerequisite for exemption from the author-
isation requirement is that no business pol-
icy decisions are made by the asset- leasing 
vehicle. It must also be managed by an in-
stitution that is already under supervision, is 
established within the European Economic 
Area and is authorised to engage in fi  nan-
cial leasing in its state of origin. Further-
more, all factoring and fi  nancial leasing in-
stitutions are now exempt from the require-
ment to identify risk takers. The exemption 
of factoring and fi  nancial leasing institu-
tions from the obligation to appoint com-
mittees will remain unchanged. The intro-
duction of a defi  nition of the term “signifi  -
cant institution” had necessitated a revision 
in this regard. However, the general order requiring that, depending on the size, in-
ternal organisation and the nature, scope, 
complexity and riskiness of the activities of 
the institution, the administrative or super-
visory bodies of factoring and fi  nancial leas-
ing institutions shall appoint from among 
their members committees to advise and 
support them in their tasks, will remain in 
effect. In addition, the Federal Financial 
Supervisory Authority (BaFin) has the power 
to require the appointment of committees. 
On the grounds of equal treatment and due 
to the fact that there appears to be no in-
crease in risk associated with the shift from 
asset- leasing vehicles for single leased 
assets to asset- leasing vehicles for multiple 
leased assets, this solution appears appro-
priate.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
December 2020  
60

both the amount of the MREL requirement and 
the decision on whether this must be met with 
subordinated instruments are at the resolution 
authority’s discretion.
Protecting retail clients
In principle, retail clients should not hold any 
instruments that are part of the banks’ primary 
loss- absorbing capacity, except for equities. 
The new Article 44a of BRRD II has therefore 
introduced two options to protect retail clients 
from non- risk- appropriate investments in 
MREL- eligible liabilities. These are either a min -
imum initial investment amount of €10,000, 
though retail clients – where their financial in -
strument portfolio does not exceed €500,000 – 
are permitted to invest up to a maximum of 
10% of their financial instrument portfolio in 
such liabilities, or alternatively a minimum de -
nomination amount of €50,000.Germany has decided to implement the second 
option, introducing a minimum denomination 
amount of €50,000 for the subordinated 
MREL- eligible liabilities of all banks. Further -
more, Article 44a of BRRD II also allows for the 
introduction of a minimum denomination 
amount for Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. 
In Germany, these instruments are therefore 
also subject to a minimum denomination 
amount of €50,000. For small and non-  
complex institutions, a different minimum de -
nomination amount of €25,000 applies to the 
latter capital instruments. Legislators did not, 
then, avail themselves of the possibility of set -
ting a minimum denomination amount higher 
than €50,000.
The introduction of a minimum denomination 
amount is intended to ensure that retail clients 
do not invest their assets excessively in instru -
ments that can be primarily used for a bail- in.

institution’s resolution or insolvency. Instead, 
investment in such instruments should be re -
served for institutional investors, who ought to 
be better able to bear losses and assess the 
risk- return relationship of such instruments. A 
retail client is not generally able to assess 
whether the return on an instrument that con -
stitutes Additional Tier 1 capital, Tier 2 capital 
or other subordinated capital adequately re -
flects the risk of default, especially as such in -
struments, in contrast to equities, tend to be 
perceived as low- risk fixed income investments.
Particularities with regard 
to the opening of liquidation 
proceedings
The new Article 32b of BRRD II has introduced 
an additional set of circumstances for opening 
liquidation proceedings. This is intended to ad -
dress situations in which an institution has 
been classified as “failing or likely to fail” 
(FOLTF) but where a resolution action would 
not be in the public interest and there are as 
yet no grounds at the national level for open -
ing liquidation proceedings. However, should 
such circumstances arise, it is not intended that 
they end up leaving the institution concerned 
in limbo because it can neither be wound up 
nor liquidated under national insolvency pro -
ceedings. As legislators were of the view that 
Section 46 of the Banking Act (moratorium 
powers) and the grounds for opening insolv -
ency proceedings laid down in Sections 17 to 
19 of the Insolvency Code ( Insolvenzordnung 
– InsO) already provided supervisors with in -
struments for handling such institutions, it was 
not deemed necessary to amend the existing 
legislation in Germany to avoid such limbo cir -
cumstances.
Credit Institution Reorganisa -
tion Act repealed
The Credit Institution Reorganisation Act ( Kredit -
institute-  Reorganisationsgesetz –  KredReorgG) is being repealed under the amendments intro -
duced by the Risk Reduction Act. This is being 
done on the grounds that it has not attained 
any practical relevance and has become obso -
lete since the introduction of the European 
resolution regime.
Amendments to other legal 
acts
The Risk Reduction Act also amends the De -
posit Guarantee Act ( Einlagensicherungsgesetz 
– EinSiG). The amendments concern both mat -
ters relating to the organisation of compensa -
tion schemes and the clarification of issues re -
lating to depositor compensation, for example 
with regard to non- eligible deposits or the 
scope and calculation of compensation claims 
as in the case of trust accounts, for instance.
Of greater significance, however, is that the 
German promotional banks, having been re -
moved from the scope of EU banking regula -
tion, likewise no longer fall within the ambit of 
the Deposit Guarantee Act, as only CRR credit 
institutions are subject to the statutory obliga -
tion to provide depositor compensation. This 
will affect the existing membership of these in -
stitutions in the compensation scheme of the 
Association of German Public Banks ( Entschädi -
gungseinrichtung des Bundesverbandes Öffent -
licher Banken Deutschlands GmbH ). Against 
this backdrop, the Deposit Guarantee Act now 
provides for the possibility of revoking mem -
bership and for the risk- appropriate transfer of 
contribution- funded financial resources to a 
different compensation scheme. The amend -
ment to the Deposit Guarantee Act is also 
being used to close a gap in the Act. Thus far, 
the Deposit Guarantee Act has not given pro -
tection schemes the ability to levy special con -
tributions to fulfil liability claims pursuant to 
Section 145 of the Act on the Recovery and 
Resolution of Institutions and Financial Groups. 
It is now set to be amended accordingly.Changes to

tended regulatory effect through national im -
plementation represent another major step to -
wards wrapping up the regulatory post-  
financial- crisis agenda and a significant contri -
bution to a further reduction of risk in the 
banking sector. However, there is still more to 
be done. The European Commission is already 
working on drafts of CRR III and CRD VI, which 
are intended, in particular, to implement the 
final Basel III package concluded at the end of 
2017.
In March 2020, the Group of Central Bank Gov -
ernors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS) agreed 
to postpone the implementation of the final 
Basel III reforms by one year in response to the 
impact of the COVID-  19 pandemic.31 Under the 
Basel standards, this is now scheduled for com -
pletion by 1 January 2023, as is the implemen -
tation of the amended Pillar 3 requirements. In light of this, subsequent deadlines are also 
being pushed back. The phase- in of the output 
floor will now end on 1  January 2028, and 
both the Fundamental Review of the Trading 
Book (FRTB) and the amended Credit Valuation 
Adjustment (CVA) framework will not have to 
be implemented until 1 January 2023. In Au -
gust 2020, the EBA received a second call for 
advice from the European Commission inviting 
it to update its analysis under the first call for 
advice in light of the impact of the COVID-  19 
pandemic. In response, the EBA published its 
recommendations on the implementation of 
Basel III in the EU, which include a quantitative 
impact assessment based on participating 
banks’ data and a number of policy recommen -
dations. The results provide a basis for the le -
gislative proposal to transpose Basel  III into 
European law (CRR III) that the European Com -
mission is expected to present by mid- 2021.Post- crisis

German enterprises’ profitability and 
 financing in 2019
Just prior to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, the profitability of non- financial enter -
prises was still in good shape despite the marked slowdown in the German economy in 2019. 
Sales were expanding significantly, although the rise was not quite as steep as in the previous two 
years due to subdued global export demand and probably also to price effects. This meant that 
the export- oriented manufacturing sector struggled to lift sales, while domestically oriented sec -
tors were again able to record an above- average increase. On the cost side, enterprises were 
confronted with higher personnel costs and additional interest- related pension provisions, while 
falling prices for intermediate goods and industrial raw materials afforded some relief. Overall, 
German enterprises’ average pre- tax profit margin remained virtually unchanged at 4.3% in 
2019.
Enterprises’ scope for internal financing broadened further in the reporting period driven, amongst 
other things, by higher profit retention. They drew much less on additional borrowed funds in 
2019 than in the previous year and trade payables, in particular, declined. The increase in liabil -
ities to banks continued, however.
The financial statements available to date provide an insight into the business sector’s liquidity 
and stability prior to the crisis. Overall, non-  financial enterprises were very well positioned in 
terms of their financing conditions and capital structure in 2019. Both the liquidity and stability 
ratios of the business sector as a whole were relatively high and exceeded the levels recorded in 
the years immediately preceding earlier recessions or crises. Despite larger sectoral differences 
and with the exception of a few weaker positions in some economic sectors, this finding is gen -
erally true across all sectors.
Revenue shortfalls – which are considerable in some cases – stemming from the coronavirus pan -
demic and the measures taken to contain it will weigh on enterprises’ profit margins in 2020. In 
addition, both the depth and speed of the economic slump triggered by the pandemic presented 
enterprises with unprecedented challenges in safeguarding liquidity. Thanks to the German busi -
ness sector’s sound financial footing at the beginning of the crisis and to government financial 
assistance measures provided this year – and partly also to the temporary suspension of the obli -
gation to file for insolvency – the business sector is yet to witness a surge in cases of insolvency 
in 2020.Deutsche Bundesbank

Underlying trends
In 2019, the German economy was character -
ised by a marked slowdown in economic activ -
ity. At 0.6%, growth in real gross domestic 
product (GDP) was only modest. Economic 
growth in the reporting year was well below 
the growth rate of potential output, thus 
lowering the German economy’s capacity util -
isation and returning aggregate capacity utilisa -
tion more or less to an average level following 
the high figure recorded in the preceding year. 
Adverse global conditions were the main factor 
weakening economic activity in Germany in 
2019. The slowdown in the global economy dampened demand for capital and intermedi -
ate goods, which are important components of 
Germany’s exports. Overall, German exports 
saw only marginal growth. Despite the slow -
down in economic activity, domestic private 
consumption rose perceptibly and at an un -
changed pace. Housing investment and the ex -
pansionary fiscal policy also provided impetus. 
Given shrinking order books and rather gloomy 
business expectations, however, investment in 
machinery and equipment failed to notably 
boost demand.
Enterprises’ pre- tax profit margin remained vir -
tually unchanged at 4.3% in 2019.1 On the one 
hand, the higher labour costs, which were due 
to robust wage growth and the return to full 
joint financing of the statutory health insurance 
scheme, dampened corporate profit margins. 
On the other hand, the prices of intermediate 
goods and industrial raw materials fell, and the 
need to adjust pension provisions was some -
what smaller, probably thanks to an increase in 
the value of the assets held for settlement. The 
income side also benefited from a significant 
increase in investment income. The two- speed 
development of the economy in the reporting 
year is also reflected in the heterogeneous prof -
itability of enterprises when broken down by 
economic sector. While the gross profit margin 
of the export-  oriented manufacturing sector 
took a harder hit, sectors with a greater do -
mestic focus were even able to increase their 
profitability, with some – namely construction 
as well as accommodation and food service ac -
tivities – achieving all- time highs.
The number of corporate insolvencies fell for 
the tenth time in a row in 2019 in view of en -
terprises’ sound capital base as well as favour -
able financing and debt restructuring condi -
tions, and stood at its lowest level since the Marked eco -

However, the scale of the decline was less pro -
nounced in 2019 than in previous years. In 
some economic sectors, such as manufacturing 
and energy supply as well as transportation 
and storage services, the frequency of insolven -
cies rose slightly.
Liquidity and stability ratios
The coronavirus pandemic and the measures 
required to contain its spread drove up enter -
prises’ need for short and medium- term finan -
cing in 2020 as they struggled to cope with 
considerable revenue shortfalls. The most re -
cent financial statements available for 2019 can 
be used to assess the liquidity and stability of 
both the business sector as a whole and of in -
dividual sectors at the beginning of the crisis. 
Years that immediately precede earlier reces -
sions or crises constitute a suitable benchmark. 
Compared with the years prior to the economic 
downturns in 2002-03 and 2009, non- financial 
enterprises were, on the whole, more robust in 
terms of their financing conditions and capital 
structure. Liquidity levels in the business sector 
as a whole were much higher. Depending on 
the indicator, sufficient or ample short- term 
funds were available to cover total short- term 
liabilities in 2019. A similar picture emerges 
with regard to the business sector’s stability 
ratios. Long- term debt ratios were lower and 
the equity base was stronger. The aggregate 
interest coverage ratio also improved over time 
on its already high level, presumably boosted 
not only by the lower debt ratio and enter -
prises’ higher profitability, but also by the on -
going low interest rate environment.3
Liquidity levels do, however, vary at sectoral 
level. In around half of the economic sectors 
under review, the quick ratio came in at under 
100%, for each sector as a whole. This meas -
ure is frequently used in practice and is based 
on the ratio of assets that can be liquidated at 
short notice, excluding inventories, to short-  Sound financing

2 The last considerable rise in overall corporate insolvencies 
was recorded during the financial and economic crisis of 
2008-09. However, in view of the magnitude of the eco -
nomic downturn, even this increase of around one-  tenth 
was moderate.
3 By contrast, the lowering of the discount rate for pension 
obligations means that enterprises with corresponding 
commitments must adjust their pension provisions in line 
with interest rates, something that is generally recorded 
under interest expenses in enterprises’ income statements. 
This, by definition, pushes down the interest coverage ratio 
and limits comparability with years prior to 2010 in which 
no annual adjustment to the applied rate of interest was 
necessary.Deutsche Bundesbank

Updated assessment of the development of zombie fi  rms 
in Germany
The process of market entry and exit of 
fi  rms, a key feature in market economies, 
may have lost effectiveness as a result of 
the low interest rate environment in the 
euro area, which has now persisted for sev-
eral years. For instance, it may be in the 
interest of undercapitalised lenders to con-
tinue fi  nancing ineffi   cient or even insolvent 
corporate debtors (known as zombie 
fi  rms).1 First, this is because low interest 
rates tend to reduce the opportunity costs 
for creditors that arise from rolling over 
loans to fi  nancially weak fi  rms or allowing 
deferral of payments. Consequently, write- 
downs on claims, realisation of losses and 
formation of provisions could then be 
avoided for a time. However, as a result, 
economic resources would continue to be 
put to less productive uses and the intensity 
of competition might decline.2
An updated assessment of the importance 
of zombie fi  rms in Germany in the low 
interest rate environment is carried out on 
the basis of individual data from non- 
fi  nancial fi  rms in the Bundesbank’s fi  nancial 
statement statistics.3 The extension of the 
reference period to 2018 takes into account 
the possibility that the persistent low inter-
est rate environment in the euro area may, 
with a time lag, bring about a rise in the 
number of zombie fi  rms.4 In addition, the 
calculations serve to provide the most up- 
to- date assessment of the share of zombie 
fi  rms prior to the outbreak of the corona-
virus pandemic.
Statistical classifi  cation of zombie fi  rms
In line with the academic literature, a fi  rst 
variant classifi  es as a zombie fi  rm any enter-
prise that cannot cover its interest payments with its operating income for three con-
secutive years. The interest coverage ratio 
for a zombie fi  rm – in other words, the ratio 
of operating income to interest expend-
iture – would be less than one. In a second 
variant, a zombie fi  rm is defi  ned as an en-
terprise that has negative cash fl  ows for 
three consecutive years.
With regard to the fi  rst variant, two statis-
tical aspects must be taken into account. 
First, when determining interest coverage 
ratios, interlinkages between enterprises on 
the income side are also incorporated by 
adding income from equity holdings in 
other fi  rms to the operating result from 
core business.5 Second, it is likely that an 
enterprise’s total interest expenditure, in-
cluding spending on discounting- related 
additional pension provisions, is decisive for 
its economic survival. For this reason, inter-
1 See, for example, Acharya et al. (2020) or Schivardi 
et al. (2017).
2 Empirical research suggests a relationship between 
the slowdown in productivity growth in some ad-
vanced economies over the past few decades and a 
rise in the number of zombie fi  rms. See Adalet 
McGowan et al. (2018).
3 For analyses for the 2015 reporting year, see 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2017). For a description of the 
JANIS dataset used, see Becker et al. (2020).
4 In order to isolate the causal effect of monetary pol-
icy on the emergence of zombie fi  rms via the interest 
rate channel, it would be necessary to use a counter-
factual scenario that models the incentives and behav-
iour of banks and the entry and exit of (zombie) fi  rms. 
As the dataset used contains no information on mar-
ket entries or exits, amongst other things, it is not pos-
sible to set up such a counterfactual scenario.
5 In the dataset, the reported interest expenditure may 
also include interest on loans that a parent company 
has taken out for its subsidiaries or affi   liates. Such af-
fi  liations statistically lower the parent company’s inter-
est coverage ratio, increasing the likelihood of it being 
incorrectly classifi  ed as a zombie fi  rm, all else being 
equal. Such distortion can be counteracted by taking 
account of the investment income metric when deter-
mining the interest coverage ratio.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
December 2020

est expenditure also includes spending on 
such additional pension provisions.6
No increase in importance of zombie 
fi  rms in low interest rate environment
When assessing the extent to which the 
low interest rate environment has fostered 
the emergence of zombie fi  rms in Germany, 
developments since 2007 –  prior to the 
start of the Great Recession – have been of 
particular interest. According to the fi  gures, 
the share of zombie fi  rms has decreased in 
the low interest rate environment. Based on 
the fi  rst variant considered, it stood at just 
6¼% in 2018, the most recent year for 
which suffi   cient data for this analysis are 
available.7 It was thus considerably smaller 
than in the years preceding the exception-
ally sharp decline in interest rates.8 This 
confi  rms the fi  ndings of earlier analyses, ac-
cording to which zombie fi  rms accounted 
for only a small share of enterprises in Ger-
many, and their quantitative importance 
has not increased in the low interest rate 
environment.9
The data show that the revenue share of 
zombie fi  rms in 2018 was only marginally 
higher than in 2007. In the same period, the 
share of tangible fi  xed assets held by zom-
bie fi  rms declined markedly on balance. 
Furthermore, measured in terms of the 
gross increase in tangible fi  xed assets in re-
lation to total assets, zombie fi  rms invested 
less than other enterprises. The ratio of an-
nual results before taxes on income to gross 
revenue was negative for zombie fi  rms. 
Moreover, these fi  rms had lower equity 
ratios, which declined during the low inter-
est rate period, meaning that their liabilities 
(in relation to total assets) were higher than 
those of the other enterprises. The fi  gures 
indicate that zombie fi  rms did not play a 
quantitatively signifi  cant role in Germany in 
terms of their number and shares of rev-enue and tangible fi  xed assets. It therefore 
cannot be established that they had a per-
ceptible dampening effect on aggregate 
productivity developments or on economic 
growth in general.
Zombie lending probably of minor 
importance  in Germany
Another channel through which zombie 
fi  rms may contribute to the misallocation of 
economic resources is via banks’ lending to 
such enterprises (known as “zombie lend-
6 Under German law, persistently low interest rates ne-
cessitate additional pension provisions for enterprises 
that have committed to paying occupational pensions 
to current and former employees. These provisions are 
recorded in the dataset as interest expenditure or la-
bour costs. See also Deutsche Bundesbank (2016).
7 Robust results for 2019 are not yet available due to 
the currently very limited data availability of the rele-
vant individual accounts.
8 It should be noted that, taken in isolation, the de-
cline in the interest rate level in recent years is likely to 
have helped stabilise enterprises’ interest coverage 
ratios.
9 The alternative variant based on cash fl  ow produces 
a similar picture, with the share of zombie fi  rms gener-
ally being lower than in the other variants and only 
increasing slightly in the period from 2007 to 2011.Zombie firms in Germany*

ing”).10 The development of zombie fi  rms’ 
liabilities to credit institutions (measured in 
terms of total assets) is remarkable: prior to 
the marked decline in interest rates, zombie 
and non- zombie fi  rms were more or less 
equally indebted to credit institutions. In 
2018, by contrast, the liabilities of non- 
zombie fi  rms to credit institutions were just 
over six times as high. As zombie fi  rms now 
have relatively low outstanding debt to 
credit institutions compared with other en-
terprises, the extent of resource misalloca-
tion via this channel is likely to be limited.
Impact of the coronavirus pandemic 
on the share of zombie fi  rms
In view of the exceptional reduction in eco-
nomic activity in 2020, the number of busi-ness insolvencies is likely to increase signifi  -
cantly in the coming quarters.11 The profi  t-
ability of non- fi  nancial enterprises in Ger-
many will probably deteriorate in the 
current year as a result of the pandemic, 
and corporate liabilities will tend to in-
crease. Taken in isolation, both factors exert 
downward pressure on interest coverage 
ratios and thus increase the probability of 
enterprises attaining zombie status in statis-
tical terms. In order to avoid unprofi  table 
business models remaining in the market 
and resources being used ineffi   ciently in the 
economy as a whole, obstacles hindering 
the market exit of zombie fi  rms should be 
circumvented or eliminated. This also means 
that the current government assistance 
measures – such as making it easier to take 
up short- time work, guarantees for corpor-
ate loans and tax relief – should only be 
maintained for as long as necessary and 
should be phased out as the economy re-
covers.
10 The term gained prominence in connection with 
developments in Japan. In the 1990s, lending to un-
profi  table enterprises continued, partly owing to the 
regulatory framework in the banking sector. For ana-
lyses of zombie lending in the euro area, see, for ex-
ample, Storz et al. (2017).

were relatively low, particularly in sectors that 
have a high level of inventories due to the na -

other economic sectors. Differences in the 
interest coverage ratio were more pronounced 
across sectors. The figures were relatively low 
in the manufacturing, transportation and stor -
age, energy, and information and communica -
tion sectors. However, in almost all economic 
sectors, the interest coverage ratio was many 
times higher than the level at which current 
interest payments from operating activities can 
be serviced.6 Despite larger sectoral differences 
and, in some cases, lower indicator values in 
individual economic sectors, financing condi -
tions and the capital structure in the business 
sector can be deemed sound across sectors.

e4 This is merely a statistical benchmark. In addition, sec -
toral particularities and group interconnections must be 
taken into account. A low liquidity ratio does not necessar -
ily indicate a threat to solvency as liquidity can be passed 
on between affiliated enterprises within a group, for in -
stance. The quick ratio should reflect the solvency of enter -
prises better than the current ratio as it is more difficult to 
liquidate inventories, which are included in the latter, than 
other short- term assets.
5 If inventories are factored into short- term assets (current 
ratio), the construction, automobile trade, retail trade and 
manufacturing sectors do not have noticeably low liquidity 
ratios. In accommodation and food service activities, by 
contrast, the ratio of cash and short-  term securities to 
short-  term liabilities (cash ratio) was high compared with 
the other sectors.

as other liabilities need to be serviced alongside interest 
payments.Deutsche Bundesbank

have been a greater factor in the increase in 
sales revenues than price effects, as sales prices 
for goods and services rose less than half as 
much as sales. For example, the prices of indus -
trial goods on the domestic market went up by 
1.1%, and prices for goods exports were also 
only 0.5% higher than in 2018. Interest income 
saw a resurgence after the previous year’s low 
figure. Income from long-term equity invest -
ments rose significantly thanks to high dividends 
of participating enterprises in trade as well as 
information and communication services.
The continued weakness in industry was also 
reflected in the very muted overall growth in manufacturing revenue in 2019. In most areas 
of manufacturing, revenue even declined. Ve -
hicle manufacturers were an exception, record -
ing stronger sales growth again after revenue 
had expanded only moderately in the previous 
year owing to supply- side difficulties following 
the introduction of the new emissions test pro -
cedure. In domestically oriented sectors, the 
positive growth in sales continued in 2019. 
Construction revenue rose particularly sharply 
in light of the ongoing boom in the sector’s 
activity.

porting year. This was due to sharply higher de -
preciation and raised personnel expenses. In 
addition to the increase in pensions provisions 
and the return to parity financing of the statu -
tory health insurance scheme, the marked 
wage rises in the reporting year are likely to 
have been a factor in the rise in personnel ex -
penses. Interest expenses, which in the low 
interest rate environment are largely influenced 
by changes in the applied rate of interest in 
pension provisions, went back down after hav -
ing risen very sharply in 2018. The growth in 
the cost of materials was only half as strong as 
in the previous two years, not least because 
commodity prices fell in 2019.Sources and uses of funds
In 2019, enterprises’ sources and uses of funds 
declined significantly in light of the economic 
slowdown. The fall in the sources of funds was 
spurred by a sharp decline in external funds 
whilst internal funds rose perceptibly. The re -
duced build- up of short- term liabilities com -
pared with 2018 was the main factor behind 
the developments in external financing. On the 
expenditure side, the acquisition of financial 
assets in particular grew less sharply than in the 
previous year. The acquisition of tangible fixed

beyond replacement purchases and the gross 
increase in tangible fixed assets did record a 
new peak overall, this was more than offset by 
a much weaker trend in the formation of in -
ventories.
Balance sheet developments
The total assets of non- financial enterprises ex -
panded in 2019. However, consistent with the 
somewhat slower growth in sales, this increase 
of around 4% was smaller than in the previous 
two years. On the assets side, the share of fi -
nancial assets in total assets remained broadly unchanged as in 2018. As enterprises become 
increasingly interlinked, long- term equity in -
vestments and receivables from affiliated com -
panies rose sharply again. The electrical engin -
eering industry recorded the highest acquisition 
of long- term equity investments, although the 
chemical and pharmaceutical industry as well 
as the information and communication sector 
significantly expanded their long- term equity 
investments as well. Trade receivables declined 
slightly on the year, while the cash item did not 
increase for the first time since 2010. In add -
ition to one- off effects in the automobile and 
energy sectors, this may also have been attrib -
utable to custody fees on enterprises’ bank bal -Growth in total

ances. Securities holdings increased only mar -
ginally due, in particular, to developments ex -
perienced by individual wholesale enterprises.
The expansion in non- financial assets – both 
overall and by sector – was steep in 2019, al -
beit somewhat weaker than in the previous 
year. The share of tangible fixed assets in total 
assets remained broadly unchanged. A number 
of sectors – including chemical and pharma -
ceutical, the automobile industry, construction, 
motor vehicle trade, the information and com -
munication sector, and business services – ac -
cumulated tangible fixed assets at an above 
average rate. Furthermore, non- financial enter -
prises continued to invest in intangible fixed 
assets. Wholesale trade, in particular, signifi -
cantly increased its holdings in the concessions, 
property rights and licenses included under this 
item. Vehicle manufacturing, energy com -
panies and the sector of transportation and 
storage also saw growth in this area. Although 
inventories again outpaced total assets, this in -
crease was significantly lower than in the previ -
ous two years. Most of the inventories were 
once again formed by the construction and 
manufacturing sectors, while trade also ex -
panded its stocks substantially.
The equity ratio of non- financial enterprises 
grew broadly across sectors in 2019, following 
a slight decline in aggregate terms in the previ -
ous year. This means that it remained at a more 
or less unchanged high level on average in 
2018-19. Both small and medium- sized enter -
prises and large enterprises experienced this in -
crease in the reporting year, with the gap be -
tween the size classes narrowing further.
Although there was marked growth in external 
funds, this remained below the increase in own 
funds. This was primarily due to the moderate 
rise in liabilities to affiliated companies, which 
had been stepped up considerably in previous 
years. In addition, trade payables fell for the 
first time since 2015, which might also be due 
to the faster settlement of existing trade pay -

balances. By contrast, liabilities to banks – es -
pecially those with a short maturity – rose sig -
nificantly, recording the highest growth rate in 
a decade. Once again, the construction sector 
received higher advance payments than before; 
this is in line with the sector’s high inventories, 
which also include construction projects that 
have been started but are not yet finished. 
Since long- term bond holdings rose signifi -
cantly in 2019, overall borrowing through the 
issuance of bonds grew more strongly than be -
fore despite the decline in short- term bonds. 
Provisions also went up sharply on account of 
the additional provisions for pensions required 
by the continuing fall in the discount rate.Trends for 2020
The coronavirus pandemic and the measures 
taken to contain it are likely to have a profound 
impact on the financial statements of non-  
financial enterprises in 2020. The official order 
to close businesses and other measures have 
already led to a widespread loss of revenue in 
the affected sectors, such as food services, 
travel services, other recreation and cultural 
services, textile retail and passenger transport, 
in individual months. The impact of the pan -
demic has also weighed considerably on Ger -
man industry’s foreign business over the course 
of 2020 thus far. Global demand for German 
export products declined sharply, and global 
supply chains experienced disruption in some 
cases. In addition, investment in machinery and 
equipment is likely to decrease sharply this year 
due to cyclical factors. By contrast, robust 
housing investment is expected to boost 
growth. Furthermore, the comprehensive pack -
age of fiscal assistance measures is having a 
stabilising effect. Enterprises’ profit margins in 
2020 are likely to be significantly affected by 
the negative economic shock caused by the 
pandemic as the variable cost component la -
bour will not decline to the same extent as 
sales despite the partial termination of employ -
ment contracts and the massive recourse to 
short- time work. In addition, the continued 
need for adjustment to provisions for pensions 
due to the discount rate is likely to result in 
higher expenditure on the cost side.7 By con -
trast, the deep global recession in 2020 means 
that there are signs of relief in the form of sig -
nificant price declines in intermediate goods 
and industrial raw materials.

slump triggered by the coronavirus shock have

Profi  tability and fi  nancial position of German listed groups 
in 2019 and an outlook for 2020
In the diffi   cult setting of the global slow-
down in growth, German listed non- 
fi  nancial groups were able to generate 
higher revenues in 2019. At the same time, 
signifi  cant cost increases had an impact, 
making for a signifi  cantly lower profi  t mar-
gin1 than in previous years. Adjusted for 
changes in the scope of consolidation, it fell 
by 1.5 percentage points to 6.0% last year, 
falling short of the 6.7% average for the 
period since reporting commenced in 
2005.2 This was mainly due to the negative 
yield development in the manufacturing 
sector, whereas the services sector profi  t 
margin was only slightly down and re-
mained at a comparatively high level.
The reporting group posted a slight 2.6% 
rise in revenue. According to the annual re-
ports, this development was attributable, in 
the main, to positive currency effects in 
connection with the consolidation of for-
eign subsidiaries.3 In addition, higher sales 
served, in some instances, to offset un-
favourable developments in producer 
prices. Overall, around 70% of the groups 
increased their revenue in 2019, with ser-
vice providers seeing signifi  cantly more pro-
nounced growth than groups belonging to 
the manufacturing sector.Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation 
and amortisation (EBITDA) remained virtu-
ally constant with an increase of 0.4%. The 
application of modifi  ed accounting stand-
ards had a positive effect on operating in-
come and, as a result, the weakening of 
profi  tability might be understated by the

2 The rates of change for profi  t margin, revenue, 
EBITDA and EBIT are published with reporting and con-
solidation basis adjustments. The fi  gures in the charts 
are unadjusted so that the size differentials between 
the items are visible. For methodological reasons, there 
may therefore be differences between the rates of 
change and the path shown in the charts.
3 The nominal effective exchange rate of the euro 
against the currencies of the 42 most important trad-
ing partners of the euro area fell by an average of 
1.5% on an annual basis in 2019, which has a positive 
impact on the euro countervalues when converting 
revenue from foreign currency to euro.Deutsche Bundesbank

fi  gures.4 The higher volume of depreciation 
caused by the changes – while leasing ex-
penses were eliminated – pushed EBITDA, 
taken in isolation, upwards.
Operating income (EBIT) fell by 17.9% com-
pared with the previous year. If the effects 
stemming from the revised accounting rules 
are taken into account, the performance of 
profi  tability is likely to have been even more 
unfavourable. The decline is attributable ex-
clusively to enterprise groups belonging to 
the manufacturing sector, which account 
for around 70% of the reporting group’s 
total income. By contrast, service providers 
were able to increase their operating in-
come slightly. For both sectors, the main 
factors driving income down were higher 
raw material costs as well as impairments 
and special expenses. This included good-
will impairment and write- downs of pro-
duction facilities due to poor earnings pro-
spects and diffi   cult sales conditions in the 
chemical and automotive sectors, retrofi  t-
ting costs rooted in the emissions scandal, 
provisions for legal disputes and penalties 
arising from corruption proceedings, and 
impairment linked to the energy sector’s 
move away from coal.The balance sheet saw considerable in-
creases in tangible fi  xed assets and fi  nan-
cial assets, up by 21% and 16% respect-
ively. This was mainly owing to newly cap-
italised right- of- use assets in connection 
with changes in international accounting 
standards and a signifi  cant exchange trans-
action in the energy sector.5 Investment by 
car manufacturers (particularly in the fi  eld 
of e- mobility) was another factor in the 
second half of 2019. In addition, intangible 
assets increased as a result of acquisitions 
and technological developments (licence 
purchases in the telecommunications sec-
tor).
In terms of fi  nancing, debt rose signifi  cantly 
more strongly than equity, meaning that 
the aggregate equity ratio contracted by 
1.2 percentage points to 29.3%. Both large 
and small groups were affected here. 
Around three- quarters of the groups posted 
a lower equity ratio than the year before. 
As a result, the leverage ratio rose slightly 
from 2.3 to 2.4.
A dramatic 21% increase in long- term fi  -
nancial debt set the tone for the debt pos-
ition. Newly recognised lease liabilities 
amounting to an estimated €90 billion 
were a factor here, as were fi  nancial liabil-
4 As a result of the change in how operating leases are 
treated for accounting purposes (International Finan-
cial Reporting Standard 16), tangible fi  xed assets and 
the associated depreciation and fi  nancial liabilities rose 
signifi  cantly. This accounting effect amounts to around 
€84 billion for tangible fi  xed assets and around €90 
billion for fi  nancial liabilities (equivalent to around 11% 
and 9% of the fi  gure for each item, respectively). De-
preciation and amortisation rose by approximately €9 
billion.
5 The exchange transaction was recognised on the 
balance sheet in the third quarter of 2019. In the pre-
vious year, the parts of the group earmarked for sale 
were reported as discontinued operations in the group 
reports and were therefore treated as disposals in the 
consolidated fi  nancial statement statistics. In the third 
quarter of 2019, these group units were consolidated 
for the fi  rst time in the respective receiving groups and 
were thus recorded as additions in the consolidated 
fi  nancial statement statistics.Equity of German non-financial groups

ities arising from the exchange transaction 
in the energy sector (€20 billion). In add-
ition, annual reports reveal that bonds 
were issued to fi  nance sales and that liabil-
ities for future corporate acquisitions were 
built up. At the same time, aggregate pen-
sion obligations grew by around one- fi  fth, 
or €28 billion, as a result of the decline in 
the reference interest rate applied for ac-
counting purposes.6
The coronavirus pandemic has been a de-
cisive force shaping business performance 
over the course of 2020 so far. Unlike the 
individual fi  nancial statements, the consoli-
dated fi  nancial statements capture the 
globally integrated value- added chains 
within the groups. Consequently, the fi  nan-
cial information provided by the groups 
serves as a particularly revealing refl  ection 
of global economic developments and the 
domestic conditions prevailing in the coun-
tries where each subsidiary is located. Pro-
duction stoppages and branch closures in 
partner countries were felt throughout 
intra- group value chains, weighing on all 
upstream and downstream links. By con-
trast, the individual fi  nancial statements 
show, in particular, the part of the value 
chain that unfolds in Germany. Owing to 
the global composition of the groups, the 
fi  rst effects of the coronavirus pandemic 
were already being felt in January and Feb-
ruary of this year. In the fi  rst quarter of 
2020, pre- tax profi  t had already fallen by 
more than half compared with the same 
period of the previous year. Estimates based 
on the fi  nancial statements of the largest 
groups in the reporting population covering 
the fi  rst three quarters of the current year 
suggest that the aggregate pre- tax profi  t 
margin (earnings before tax as a percentage 
of revenue) will plunge in 2020 and could 
turn negative for the fi  rst time since these 
statistics were fi  rst compiled in 2005. This is 
due, in particular, to a sharp downturn in the spring months, while the estimates 
show that a clear recovery had already 
begun in the third quarter. The groups in 
the manufacturing sector were key to the 
extremely weak fi  gures. In terms of the ser-
vices sector, the aviation industry experi-
enced declines but these were partly offset 
by positive developments in the telecom-
munications, logistics and software sectors.
According to the group reports, cross- sector 
declines in demand, closures of trading out-
lets and production stoppages worldwide 
plus currency effects are likely to have 
placed signifi  cant strains on revenue. It is 
estimated to have fallen by almost one- 
tenth in the fi  rst three quarters of 2020 
against the same period last year. Profi  t be-
fore tax is likely to have dropped by more 
than 90% over this period. In addition to 
the repercussions of the pandemic, such as 
increased depreciation of tangible and in-
tangible assets, a key factor in this drop was 
an additional extraordinary burden arising 
from multi- billion- dollar criminal proceed-
ings in the chemicals sector7 and the associ-
ated additional provisioning.

when it comes to safeguarding liquidity.8 Fiscal 
policymakers initiated, amongst other things, 
extensive lending programmes by promotional 
banks with a full assumption of credit risk by 
government in some cases. Besides access to 
existing credit lines, this is likely to give rise to a 
considerable increase in corporate liabilities to 
banks.9 Nevertheless, given the German busi -
ness sector’s sound financial position at the be -
ginning of the crisis and the government’s fi -
nancial assistance measures –  as well as the 
temporary suspension of the obligation to file 
for insolvency, which is tied to certain condi -
tions – there does not appear to be a substan -
tial rise in corporate insolvencies in 2020.10Safeguarding

ness sector and

government 
assistance 
measures There may have been barely any year- on- 
year change in the tangible fi  xed asset ratio. 
Goodwill impairments are likely to have 
been offset by the countermovement of in-
tangible assets build- up in the wake of new 
corporate acquisitions. There was a slight 
decline in tangible fi  xed assets net of good-
will.
As cash inﬂ  ows from operating activities 
dropped off, groups secured their liquidity 
by scaling up bond issuance, taking on 
more bank liabilities and selling off business 
units. Across all sectors, there was a marked 
increase in liquid funds. On the fi  nancing 
side, this was accompanied by a corres-
ponding increase in debt. A major corpor-
ate takeover was also a contributing factor 
here. In turn, the equity ratios of groups in 
all sectors will likely have fallen this year, 
though the strongest decline will have been 
recorded by enterprise groups belonging to the services sector. Poor profi  tability de-
pressed equity in the manufacturing sector. 
The exceptional path traced by the services 
sector is entirely on the back of a major 
takeover in the telecommunications indus-
try.

pilot survey on the expectations of firms in Germany 
(https://www.bundesbank.de/en/bundesbank/research/
pilot-survey-on-the-expectations-of-firms ).
9 Moreover, in addition to the increase in the bonds item, 
there may also be a rise in liabilities to affiliated companies 
as internal capital markets play a significant role in groups, 
especially in crisis years. See Almeida et al. (2015).
10 Preliminary data from the Federal Statistical Office on 
the standard insolvency proceedings initiated in the first 
ten months of the current year point to a decline in corpor -
ate insolvencies in 2020 compared with the previous year. 
In March, the obligation to file for insolvency due to 
pandemic- related insolvency was suspended until 30 Sep -
tember 2020. This was extended in September for overind -
ebted yet still solvent enterprises until 31 December 2020. 
Nevertheless, the data on the standard insolvency proceed -
ings initiated in October 2020 are below those of the pre -
vious months despite the suspension of the obligation to 
file for insolvency having come to an end.Deutsche Bundesbank

associations), money market funds, and the European Central Bank and national central
banks (the Eurosystem).  1 Source: ECB.  2 In Germany, only savings deposits.

portfolios of securities issued by MFIs in the euro area.  4 In Germany, bank debt
securities with maturities of up to one year are classed as money market paper.5 Excluding liabilities arising from securities issued.  6 After deduction of inter-MFI
participations.  7 The German contributions to the Eurosystem's monetary aggregates

the German contribution, the difference between the volume of euro banknotes

domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).

posits retained on ceded business as well as registered bonds, borrowers' note loans

cluded there.  4 The term "pension funds" refers to the institutional sector "pension

rity funds are not included.  5 Own funds correspond to the sum of net worth and the
liability item "Shares and other equity".
