Economic conditions
Underlying trends
Overall economic output probably gained 
somewhat more momentum in the second 
quarter of 2018 than it had at the beginning of 
the year. This is due in part to the fact that the 
special factors, which were having a dampen -
ing effect in the first quarter, are now petering 
out. The exceptionally virulent wave of flu, 
which is likely to have had a negative impact 
on economic activity in the first three months 
of the year, was no longer a factor in the 
second quarter. A countermovement is also ex -
pected to be seen in government consump -
tion, which showed a marked decline in the 
first quarter for the first time in several years. 
Industrial activity gained traction again on the 
back of the recovery in export trade. Even 
though it is unlikely that the high growth rates 
seen last year will be achieved, the manufactur -
ing sector could be gaining greater prominence 
again as a key driver of economic activity. 
Owing to the ongoing excellent labour market 
situation and the strong wage growth, private 
consumption probably remained a cornerstone 
of economic growth. Finally, activity in the 
flourishing construction sector probably ex -
panded significantly, despite the existing cap -
acity constraints.
Industry
German industrial output in May 2018 grew 
strongly by a seasonally adjusted 2¾% on the 
month. The average for April and May was 
thus slightly higher than in the first quarter of 
2018 (+¼%). Manufacturers of pharmaceutical 
products, in particular, reported considerable 
growth in output. In line with this, consumer 
goods output expanded most strongly overall 
(+1½%). By contrast, manufacturers of capital 
goods were only able to increase their produc -tion volume by a marginal extent (+¼%). The 
strong increase in motor vehicle production, in 
particular, was the decisive factor behind the 
positive overall result, while German mechan -
ical engineering firms had to cope with sharp 
production cutbacks. Intermediate goods out -
put remained well below the level of the first 
quarter (-½%).
After declining for four consecutive months 
after the turn of the year, industrial orders rose 
sharply again in May 2018 by a seasonally ad -
justed 2½% compared with the figure for April, 
which had undergone a marked upward revi -
sion. However, the average inflow of new 
orders in April and May was still clearly below 
the level of the previous quarter (-1%). This was 
due to the decline in orders from Germany 
(-1¾%) and, in particular, from the euro area 
(-5¼%). Demand for industrial products from 
non- euro area countries grew strongly, however 
(+2¾%). Excluding the rather irregular influx of 
new large orders, however, the overall order in -
take contracted to a much lesser extent on the 
whole (-¼%), and the gap between the inflow 
of orders from the euro area and non- euro area 
countries is narrowing for the most part. With 
regard to the individual sectors, only manufac -
turers of capital goods were affected by the 
weaker demand (-3¼%). By contrast, producers 
of intermediate and consumer goods received 
significantly more new orders (+2% and +1¼%, 
respectively). The order situation in German in -
dustry has probably remained very favourable 
on the whole. This is also indicated by the back -
log of orders, which in May 2018 significantly 
exceeded the level of the first quarter.
Industrial sales rose strongly in May 2018 on 
the month by a seasonally adjusted 1%, follow -
ing the path set by industrial output, albeit to a 
lesser extent. The average for April and May 
was thus perceptibly higher than the level re -
corded in the first quarter (+½%). With regard 
to the regional distribution of sales, a strong German econ -
omy probably 
gained some -

increase was seen in countries outside the euro 
area in particular, owing mainly to the buoyant 
demand for motor vehicles in these countries. 
By contrast, sales of German industrial enter -
prises in the euro area went up only slightly, 
whereas domestic turnover even posted a de -
cline. Broken down by sector, sales of inter -
mediate and capital goods rose significantly. 
Producers of consumer goods, on the other 
hand, saw a considerable drop in sales. In line 
with the sharp rise in foreign industrial sales, 
nominal exports also increased considerably in 
May by a seasonally adjusted 1¾% on the 
month. The average for April and May was also 
significantly higher than the level recorded in 
the first quarter of 2018 (+¾%). In price-  
adjusted terms, growth was, however, signifi -
cantly lower at ¼%. Seasonally adjusted nom -
inal imports increased at a more moderate 
pace in May compared with the previous 
month (+¾%). Taking the average of April and 
May, however, they were up significantly on 
the level of the first quarter (+2¼%). The sharp 
rise in energy prices was nonetheless the de -
cisive factor behind the growth. After adjust -
ment for price effects, the increase was there -
fore lower (+1%).
Construction
Construction output continued on its upward 
trajectory in May 2018, rising steeply by a sea -
sonally adjusted 3% on the month. On an aver -
age of April and May, it was also up signifi -
cantly on the level of the first quarter (+2½%). 
This increase was due to very strong growth in 
the main construction sector (+7%), while con -
struction activity in the finishing trades fell 
short of the prior- quarter level (-¾%). The con -
struction boom in Germany is therefore con -
tinuing. The order intake in the main construc -
tion sector in April – figures are available up to 
then – fell sharply by 5¼% on the level of the 
first quarter, which was particularly marked by 
a number of large orders. That said, the equip -
ment utilisation of construction firms as well as 
their range of orders were – according to the Construction 
boom

Ifo Institute – only slightly down on their peak 
levels and the share of companies reporting 
production hold- ups due to staffing shortages 
once again reached a new record level.
Labour market
Employment continued to grow substantially in 
May 2018. The particularly high growth rates 
seen in the months around the turn of the year 
were no longer achieved, however. There were 
37,000 more persons in work in seasonally ad -
justed terms than in the previous month. Over 
the last twelve months, total employment has 
risen by 593,000 persons, or 1.3%. As in the 
past, the continued expansion in total employ -
ment was due primarily to the strong increase 
of 770,000 persons in jobs subject to social se -
curity contributions between April 2017 and 
April 2018. The number of self- employed per -
sons showed a further fall, while the number of 
persons working exclusively in low- paid part-  
time jobs stabilised. The leading indicators of 
labour demand, such as the BA-  X job index of 
the Federal Employment Agency (BA) and the 
Ifo employment barometer, remain at a high 
level. According to the indicators, however, 
firms might have been somewhat more reluc -
tant to hire new staff than in recent months. 
For example, the labour market barometer of 
the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) for 
the coming months is indicating that the high 
demand for labour will stabilise.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment continued 
to fall slightly in June month on month. There 
were 2.34 million persons registered as un -
employed with the Federal Employment 
Agency, 15,000 fewer than in May. The un -
employment rate held firm at 5.2%. On the 
whole, there were 197,000 fewer persons 
registered as unemployed than in the same 
month last year. Total underemployment 
showed a somewhat stronger decrease during 
this same period, which was due to a simultan -
eous decline in the number of persons taking 
part in labour market policy measures. The un -employment component of the IAB labour 
market barometer sank once again and is now 
only slightly in positive territory. This suggests 
that unemployment could decline to a lesser 
extent in the next three months.
Prices
In June 2018, crude oil prices almost main -
tained the high level they had previously 
reached despite production expansions. They 
were only 2% lower than in the previous 
month, but exceeded the previous year’s level 
by almost two- thirds. Crude oil prices were still 
fluctuating at around the US$75 mark in the 
first half of July, before falling to US$72 at the 
end of the reporting period. Crude oil futures 
for deliveries six months ahead were being 
traded without any notable discount, while de -
liveries 12 months ahead were being traded at 
a discount of US$1½.
Import prices rose sharply in May in seasonally 
adjusted terms, which was not due solely to 
the energy component. Even excluding energy, 
the depreciation of the euro was making itself 
clearly felt. Producer prices, for which data are 
already available for June, showed a similar 
pattern, albeit in a weaker form. The annual 
growth rate increased recently both in the case 
of import and producer prices to around 3%.
Consumer prices (HICP) rose in June by a sea -
sonally adjusted 0.2% on the month. Energy 
prices continued to rise moderately, probably 
as a result of the widening of margins at re -
fineries. Food prices also went up slightly. In 
the case of industrial goods excluding energy, 
the price increase was somewhat stronger 
again for the first time in several months. Prices 
for services remained unchanged despite price 
reductions in travel services. This was due in 
part to a moderate increase in rents. Annual 
headline HICP inflation fell from +2.2% to 
+2.1% overall (CPI likewise from +2.2% to 
+2.1%), and excluding energy and food from 
+1.5% to +1.1%. HICP as a whole is expected Further marked

to continue to grow by 2% in the coming 
months.
Public finances1
Local government finances
In the first quarter of this year, the local govern -
ment core budgets and off- budget entities 
posted a deficit of €5½ billion. This represents 
a fall of €½ billion on the start of last year. Rev -
enue rose considerably by 4% (€2 billion). Of 
this, tax revenue increased sharply by 5½% (€1 
billion), which was primarily attributable to the 
8% boost in local business tax after deducting 
shares accruing to other government levels. By 
contrast, transfers from state government rose 
at a more subdued pace overall (+2½%, or €½ 
billion).
At 4½% (€2½ billion), the rise in spending was 
slightly more pronounced than the increase in 
revenue. Spending on personnel went up by 
the same rate (by €½ billion). Although the ef -
fect of the collective wage agreement’s second 
adjustment stage, which came into force in 
February 2017, had more or less dissipated, the 
agreed upgrades to a higher pay grade and the 
switchover to a new pay scheme appear to still 
be making themselves felt. Moreover, there is 
likely to have been a further marked increase in 
staffing levels. Growth in other operating ex -
penditure remained moderate at 2½% (€½ bil -
lion). Spending on social benefits stagnated: 
while spending on social assistance, in particu -
lar, went up, this was offset by the fact that 
expenditure on benefits for asylum seekers fell 
sharply again and spending on accommoda -
tion costs for recipients of unemployment 
benefit II decreased. Following subdued devel -
opments overall last year, fixed asset formation 
surged by 16% (just under €1 billion) at the 
start of the year.
Personnel expenditure is set to continue rising 
over 2018 as a whole. The reason for this is the 
collective wage agreement of April 2018, under which pay rates were initially raised by an aver -
age of 3.2% from March onwards. In addition, 
it is possible that other operating expenditure 
and social benefits will rise more sharply again 
later in the year. In view of the surpluses gener -
ated in recent years, the extensive funding for 
investment provided by central government 
and the much lamented shortcomings of the 
local transport and education infrastructure, 
fixed asset formation is expected to be given a 
continued boost.2 Further dynamic develop -
ments are also expected on the revenue side. 
According to the May tax estimate, local gov -
ernment tax revenue (including amounts attrib -
utable to city states) is expected to increase sig -
nificantly by 5%. Transfers from state govern -
ment will probably also rise markedly. The latter 
development is supported by growth in tax 
revenue at the state government level as well 
as by higher funds from central government to 
cover accommodation costs for recipients of 
unemployment benefit II. Overall, local govern -
ment budgets could therefore run a high cash 
surplus, as in the previous year. The medium-  
term outlook also remains extremely positive in 
this regard.
The usual seasonal deficit at the start of the 
year3 was covered to a large extent by the re -
serves, which many local authorities had 
topped up with cash surpluses from the previ -
ous year. According to the preliminary debt 
statistics, liabilities increased by only €½ billion 
(to just over €142½ billion) as against year- end Slightly higher

1 The short commentaries on public finances present re -
cent outturns that were not yet available when the regular 
quarterly reports on public finances (published in the Feb -
ruary, May, August and November editions of the Monthly 
Report) went to press. For detailed data on budgetary de -
velopments and public debt, see the statistical section of 
this report.
2 The altogether high surplus notwithstanding, some mu -
nicipalities will probably still be subject to restrictions on 
increasing investment due to budgetary rules. For example, 
local government finances in North Rhine-  Westphalia are 
particularly strained and characterised by high cash ad -
vances. While there was a clear cash surplus (€3 billion) 
throughout the federal state last year, capital depletion was 
identified in many municipalities (in the case of double-  
entry booking), which limits scope for investment.

minimal funding from their shares in income tax, which is 
offset in the final quarter.Deutsche Bundesbank

2017. While credit market debt fell by €1½ bil -
lion (to €93½ billion), cash advances rebounded 
significantly by almost €2 billion (to €45½ bil -
lion).4 Cash advances are actually only intended 
to bridge liquidity shortfalls over the course of 
the year. The persistently high level of cash ad -
vances suggests that some local government 
budgets are still strained. These cases are con -
centrated in a small number of federal states.
Statutory health insurance 
scheme
In the first quarter of 2018, the statutory health 
insurance (SHI) scheme5 recorded its usual sea -
sonal deficit. At €2 billion, this was broadly on 
a par with deficit levels seen in the previous 
two years. The health fund recorded a slight 
year- on- year improvement in the deficit, which 
amounted to €2½ billion, while the surplus re -
corded by the health insurance institutions 
dipped marginally to just under €½ billion.
The health insurance institutions’ revenue, 
which mainly consists of transfers from the 
health fund, grew by just under 3½%. At the 
same time, supplementary contribution rates 
were slightly lower.6 Expenditure grew at a 
marginally higher rate. Growth in spending on 
hospital treatment, a particularly large expend -
iture item, was comparatively moderate (+2%), 
much as it was for outpatient treatment 
(+2½%), which had risen very sharply in the 
previous year. By contrast, spending on 
pharmaceuticals, remedies and therapeutic ap -
pliances, and sickness benefit increased at an 
above- average rate.
The health fund’s revenue rose by just over 
3½%. Despite the slight decline in the average 
supplementary contribution rate, growth in re -
ceipts from contributions was slightly stronger 
at 4%. This was primarily due to what were, 
overall, substantial increases in higher per cap -
ita earnings subject to compulsory contribu -
tions and employment, which resulted in a rise 
of 4½% in employees’ contributions. Growth in pension contributions was less pronounced as 
the pension increase in mid-2017 was lower 
and the number of pension recipients is cur -
rently only edging upwards. Other revenue 
more or less stagnated on account of the cen -
tral government grant remaining constant at its 
new standard level. The fund’s expenditure,

4 Caution should be exercised when considering changes 
in sub- categories. In the preliminary debt statistics for the 
final quarter of 2017, it would appear that, for a large num -
ber of municipalities, the allocation of liabilities to these 
categories had been revised. The borrower’s note loans 
taken out to safeguard liquidity were assigned to regular 
budgetary loans (as bonds for comparable purposes previ -
ously were). This triggers a purely methodology- based de -
cline in outstanding cash advances compared with the 
non- revised figures for previous quarters. The 2017 annual 
statistics, which will be published in August, should enable 
proper classification by funding type. See Landtag Nord -

ments to the health insurance institutions, in -
creased at a slightly slower pace than revenue.
Based on the assumptions provided by the 
group of SHI estimators in autumn 2017, the 
health fund was expected to run a slight deficit 
for the year as a whole. This is the result of 
reserve- financed transfers to the innovation 
and structural funds (around €½ billion). How -
ever, income subject to contributions could de -
velop more favourably and expenditure7 could 
rise more moderately than expected at that 
time. In addition, the average supplementary 
contribution rate is somewhat higher than the 
rate deemed necessary by the Federal Ministry of Health last autumn to cover relevant ex -
penditure. All in all, this raises the prospect of a 
significant surplus for the health insurance in -
stitutions and the SHI scheme as a whole this 
year, too.
Under draft legislation, next year will see parity 
funding extended to supplementary contribu -
tions and contributions reduced for self-  
employed persons. This parity, according to 
which enterprises will pay half of supplemen -
tary contributions in future, will have no direct 
impact on the SHI scheme’s finances. By con -
trast, the relief for self- employed persons will 
lead to revenue shortfalls of almost €1 billion. 
Moreover, additional funds were earmarked in 
the coalition agreement, not least for add -
itional nursing staff.8 Looking ahead, demo -
graphic developments will rein in revenue and 
put pressure on healthcare expenditure. It 
would therefore appear pertinent to achieve 
further efficiency gains in order to limit contri -
bution burdens.
Public long- term care 
 insurance scheme
The core area9 of the public long- term care in -
surance scheme recorded a deficit of €1 billion 
in the first quarter of 2018. The further deteri -
oration by €½ billion compared with the result 
at the start of the previous year is ultimately 
due to the fact that, at that time, the effects of 
the benefit expansions introduced under the 
second Act to Strengthen Long- term Care 
(Pflegestärkungsgesetz II)  on expenditure had 
not yet fully unfolded.Renewed con -

7 The Federal Ministry of Health’s slightly lower estimate is 
taken as a basis here.
8 A draft bill prepared by ministry officials for an act to 
boost nursing staff levels envisages increased spending by 
the health insurance institutions, which is already expected 
to amount to around €1½ billion in 2020. In addition, the 
health fund is to take €½ billion per year from 2019 to 
2022 from its reserves and increase its deficit by paying this 
into the hospital structures fund.

Total revenue rose by just over 4½%. As in the 
case of the SHI scheme, this was driven by 
strong growth in employees’ contributions. 
However, climbing by 11½% following the 
entry into force of the second Act to Strengthen 
Long- term Care, the increase in expenditure 
was once again considerably higher. With the 
exception of fully inpatient care, this affected 
all bigger benefit areas. An increase of 8% was 
recorded for the benefits in kind that are larger 
expenditure items. In the case of cash benefits, 
spending rose by as much as 21%. Both care 
allowance payments and pension contribution 
payments for those providing care for a relative 
went up significantly.
A further deficit increase is on the cards for the 
year as a whole as well, although expenditure 
growth is set to slow down considerably in 
subsequent quarters (deficit in 2017: €2½ bil -
lion). In the absence of further benefit in -
creases, the deficit would fall slightly next year. 
However, the draft bill prepared by ministry of -
ficials for an act to boost nursing staff levels as 
part of the coalition deal envisages additional 
spending of just under €½ billion per year.10 All 
things considered, the distributable reserves, 
which amounted to €7 billion at the end of 
2017, could therefore fall to their statutory 
lower limit of just over €1½ billion at present 
by as early as next year. Against this backdrop, 
the possibility of significantly increasing the 
contribution rate is currently being floated, 
with additional receipts first being used to gen -
erate a surplus again and top up the reserves. 
However, given the stronger rise in spending 
expected in the longer term, these improve -
ments are likely to be only short- lived.
Securities markets
Bond market
At €102.9 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in May 2018 was lower than the 
previous month’s figure (€128.4 billion). After 
deducting the lower redemptions and taking account of changes in issuers’ holdings of their 
own debt securities, net issuance of domestic 
debt securities came to €20.3 billion. The out -
standing volume of foreign debt securities in 
Germany rose by €0.5 billion during the report -
ing month, which meant that the outstanding 
volume of debt instruments in the German 
market increased by €20.8 billion overall.

April). Central government was the main issuer 
of new securities (€13.0 billion), chiefly in the 
form of two- year Federal Treasury notes 
(Schätze) to the tune of €5.7 billion and five-  
year Federal notes (Bobls) in the amount of 
€3.0 billion. It also issued ten and 30-year 
Bunds totalling €2.5 billion and €1.8 billion re -
spectively. State governments redeemed their 
own bonds to the net value of €2.0 billion.
Domestic credit institutions raised their capital 
market debt by €6.7 billion net in May, follow -
ing net redemptions of €0.5 billion in April. In -
creases were seen primarily in the outstanding 
volume of mortgage Pfandbriefe (€3.0 billion) 
and debt securities issued by specialised credit 
institutions (€5.7 billion), which include, for ex -
ample, public promotional banks. This con -
trasted with net redemptions of public Pfand -
briefe (€1.8 billion) and other bank debt secur -
ities that can be structured flexibly (€0.1 billion).Domestic enterprises issued bonds with a net 
value of €2.6 billion in the reporting month, 
compared with €7.2 billion one month earlier. 
On balance, these issuances were attributable 
to both other financial institutions and non-  
financial corporations.
Foreign investors were the main buyers of 
bonds in May (€19.5 billion). The Deutsche 
Bundesbank also purchased debt securities for 
€7.7 billion net, predominantly in the context 
of the asset purchase programmes. By contrast, 
domestic non- banks and domestic credit insti -
tutions sold bonds in the amount of €4.8 bil -
lion and €1.6 billion net respectively.
Equity market
In the month under review, domestic enter -
prises issued new shares totalling €1.2 billion 
net in the German equity market. The volume 
of foreign equities in the German market fell by 
€3.1 billion over the same period. On balance, 
shares were purchased chiefly by domestic 
credit institutions (€1.2 billion), but also by for -
eign investors (€0.6 billion). This contrasted 
with net sales by domestic non- banks totalling 
€3.7 billion.
Mutual funds
In May, German mutual funds recorded muted 
net inflows of €1.9 billion (April: €8.4 billion). 
On balance, retail funds were the chief benefi -
ciaries (€1.2 billion). Mixed securities funds 
were the main issuers of new shares (€1.7 bil -
lion), but funds of funds and equity funds also 
placed new shares on the market (€0.9 billion 
and €0.4 billion, respectively). Bond funds, on 
the other hand, recorded outflows of funds 
amounting to €0.9 billion. The outstanding vol -
ume of foreign mutual fund units sold in Ger -
many rose by €3.2 billion in the reporting 
month. Domestic non- banks were the main

Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €12.6 billion in May 2018, putting it €10.9 
billion below the level of the previous month. 
This was chiefly attributable to a lower invisible 
current transactions balance, which comprises 
services as well as primary and secondary in -
come, compounded by a narrower surplus in 
the goods account.
In the month under review, the surplus in the 
goods account was down on the month, fall -
ing by €1.2 billion to €21.5 billion. In this con -
text, exports of goods fell more sharply than 
imports.
Germany recorded a deficit of €8.9 billion in 
invisible current transactions in May, compared 
with a surplus of €0.8 billion one month earlier. 
This deterioration was mainly caused by a de -
cline in the primary income balance which out -
weighed the upturn in the secondary income 
balance. Moreover, the deficit in the services 
account widened. The primary income account 
saw net expenditure in the amount of €7.4 bil -
lion, compared with net income of €4.0 billion 
in April. The turnaround was largely attribut -
able to higher dividend payments on portfolio 
investments by non- residents. The increase in 
general government revenue from current 
taxes on income and wealth that primarily took 
place as a result of this was instrumental in im -
proving the secondary income balance, gener -
ating a virtually balanced result of €0.1 billion, 
compared with a deficit of €2.6 billion in the 
previous month. In the services account, the 
deficit widened by €1.0 billion to €1.6 billion. 
Small increases in a number of items had the 
effect of pushing up revenue, but the increase 
in expenditure, largely on the back of higher 
spending on travel, was weightier.Current account

Against the backdrop of a spike in market un -
certainty and a slight waning in the momen -
tum of the global economy, German cross-  
border portfolio investment posted net capital 
imports of €19.5 billion in May, compared with 
net capital exports totalling €19.2 billion in 
April. This was mainly due to net purchases of 
German securities in the amount of €19.7 bil -
lion by foreign investors, who acquired both 
German government bonds (€6.7 billion) and 
private sector bonds (€4.8 billion), with a par -
ticular appetite for bank bonds, whilst also 
buying large amounts of money market paper 
(€8 billion). Alongside purchasing shares to the 
tune of €0.6 billion net, they disposed of mu -
tual fund shares worth €0.3 billion on balance. 
Domestic investors acquired modest amounts 
of foreign securities (€0.2 billion), purchasing 
mutual fund shares (€3.2 billion) and debt se -
curities (€0.5 billion), while parting with shares 
(€3.5 billion).
In May, direct investment likewise generated 
net capital imports, in this instance amounting 
to €2.1 billion, compared with net capital ex -
ports of €13.5 billion in April. Direct investment 
funds flowing into Germany gave rise to capital 
imports totalling €3.7 billion, with foreign com -
panies augmenting their equity stakes in Ger -
many only marginally (€0.2 billion), but capital 
inflows through intra- group lending (€3.5 bil -
lion) –  here executed solely in the shape of 
financial  credits – had a greater impact on de -velopments. Domestic enterprises supplied 
their group units abroad with a net €1.6 billion 
worth of funds, doing so by bolstering their 
equity capital (€4.1 billion). By contrast, the re -
demption of trade credits within the scope of 
credit transactions with affiliated companies 
led to a shifting of funds to Germany (€2.5 bil -
lion).
Other statistically recorded investment, which 
comprises loans and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank de -
posits and other investments, registered net 
capital exports of €14.5 billion in May, as op -
posed to net capital imports of €3.4 billion one 
month previously. This result arose primarily 
from outflows in the banking system (€23.5 bil -
lion), driven by the increase in the Bundes -
bank’s net claims (€30.1 billion). On the one 
hand, there was a significant rise in its TARGET2  
claims (€53.8 billion), but on the other hand, 
there were higher deposits on the part of for -
eign counterparties at the Bundesbank (€23.6 
billion). Conversely, credit institutions recorded 
net capital imports (€6.6 billion), chiefly as a 
result of higher short- term liabilities. Non- banks 
also experienced net capital inflows (€9.0 bil -
lion), thanks to the activities of enterprises and 
households (€8.0 billion) as well as to those of 
general government (€1.0 billion).

The market for Federal securities: 
holder structure and the main drivers 
of yield movements
German government bonds play a key role in the euro area’s spot and futures markets, and have 
become a major benchmark for the price of other financial instruments in the euro area. Their 
good availability and high liquidity have typically made German Federal securities an important 
and attractive investment instrument for national and international investors alike. This attractive -
ness is reflected in a broad international and sectoral holder structure. From a central bank per -
spective, the market for government bonds has taken on far greater significance over the past 
few years. The ECB Governing Council’s decision to purchase public sector securities (public sector 
purchase programme, or PSPP) turned this segment of the bond market into a key area of engage -
ment for monetary policy. Under the PSPP, the Bundesbank purchased just under one- quarter of 
the total outstanding volume of Federal securities up to the end of 2017, sharply altering the 
holder structure. Holders from non- euro area countries were the main sellers of Federal securities 
to the Bundesbank. Within the euro area, the securities were sold chiefly by monetary financial 
institutions (MFIs), ie investors with access to the deposit facility. Against this backdrop, possible 
effects of the purchase programme manifested in sectoral portfolio adjustments and the exchange 
rate. Generally speaking, the purchases reduced the freely tradable volume of Federal securities 
in free float; this spread to availability (scarcity premium) and market liquidity (liquidity premium). 
Over the longer term, the yield on ten- year Federal bonds (Bunds) was shaped by scarcity pre -
miums, expectations regarding key interest rates, and international determinants.Deutsche Bundesbank

The importance of the bond 
market to the central bank
The market for Federal securities is an import -
ant segment of the international bond market. 
Being highly liquid, German government secur -
ities play a key role in the euro area’s spot and 
futures markets, and have become a major 
benchmark for the price of other financial in -
struments in the euro area.1
From a central bank perspective, the bond mar -
kets and hence the market for Federal secur -
ities have grown in importance over the past 
few years.2 The Eurosystem’s initial response to 
the financial and sovereign debt crisis was to 
start lowering the key interest rates and intro -
ducing a host of non- standard measures in 
2007. As of June 2014 – with key interest rates 
near 0% – the ECB then adopted unconven -
tional measures intended to further increase 
the degree of monetary policy accommoda -
tion. Alongside targeted longer- term refinan -
cing operations, these included a series of asset 
purchase programmes, which, when the ex -
panded asset purchase programme (APP) was 
adopted, ultimately also envisaged the pur -
chase of public sector securities under a dedi -
cated programme (PSPP) from March 2015 (see 
the box on pages  17 to  19). This made the 
bond market an important area of engagement 
for monetary policy. As monetary policy trans -
mission also flows through the bond market, 
central banks consider it important to under -
stand which transmission channels are acti -
vated by the measures. Changes in the holder 
structure can provide indications of this. In 
addition, unwanted side effects such as the 
relative scarcity of Federal securities or a pos -
sible deterioration in market liquidity, as influ -
enced by the purchases, have to be monitored.Market developments and 
holder structure of Federal 
securities
Federal securities are an important tool for Fed -
eral Government borrowing. Their share in the 
total volume outstanding in the German bond 
market has risen by 10 percentage points to 
just over 35% since the launch of monetary 
union in 1999.3 Issuance follows a fixed calen -
dar set by Federal Republic of Germany – Fi -
nance Agency (see the box on pages 23 to 25). 
It peaked in 2009 and 2010, during the finan -
cial and economic crisis. As central govern -
ment’s budgetary situation subsequently im -
proved, net issuance dropped significantly and 
has hovered around the zero mark since 2014. 
Since then, at just under €200 billion each year, 
the Finance Agency has refinanced roughly 
one- sixth of outstanding central government 
debt using securities with a maturity of be -
tween six months and 30 years.
Federal securities typically have a very broad in -
vestor base. Demand for German government 
bonds comes from all sectors inside and out -
side Germany. The launch of monetary union 
fundamentally altered the market environment 
for bonds issued by the domestic public sector. 
Within the euro area, the currency- specific ad -
vantage of issuing securities in Deutsche Mark 
fell away, meaning that German public sector 
issuance has since competed directly with pub -
lic sector debtors of the partner countries in 
the euro area. However, thanks to their high Market for

Public sector purchase programme
On 22 January 2015, the Governing Council 
of the European Central Bank (ECB) an-
nounced the launch of an expanded asset 
purchase programme (APP), which broad-
ened the existing covered bond purchase 
programme (CBPP3; launched in October 
2014) and the asset- backed securities pur-
chase programme (ABSPP; launched in No-
vember 2014) to include securities issued by 
the public sector (public sector purchase 
programme – PSPP; launched in March 
2015).1 The corporate sector purchase pro-
gramme (CSPP) was added to the APP in 
June 2016. The objective of the purchase 
programmes is to provide signifi  cant mon-
etary policy accommodation, thus contrib-
uting to an infl  ation rate of below, but close 
to, 2% over the medium term. Initially, 
monthly net asset purchases (purchases 
minus reinvestments of maturing assets) 
under the APP amounted to €60 billion; the 
volume was then raised to €80 billion and 
has since been scaled back to €30 billion. 
The PSPP is by far the biggest component 
of the APP .Under the PSPP , the European Central Bank 
and the Eurosystem national central banks 
(NCBs) acquire securities issued by central 
governments, agencies as well as inter-
national organisations and multilateral de-
velopment banks (supranational bonds) lo-
cated in the euro area.2 Moreover, since 
January 2016, regional and local govern-
ment bonds, such as the debt of the Ger-
man federal states, have been eligible for 
purchase under the PSPP .
There are detailed rules and restrictions de-
signed to keep risk to a minimum for pur-
chases under the PSPP . All securities must 
be eligible as collateral for monetary policy 
operations, have minimum ratings from ex-
ternal credit rating agencies accepted in the 
Eurosystem,3 be denominated in euro and 
have a remaining maturity of between 1 
and 31 years.4

3 Bonds that do not meet the minimum credit rating 
requirements can continue to be used as collateral for 
monetary policy operations where the issuing member 
state has successfully completed a (regular) review 
under a fi  nancial assistance programme. However, on 
22 June 2016, the Governing Council of the ECB de-
cided that Greek bonds which would otherwise fall 
under this regulation cannot be purchased under the 
PSPP until Greece can demonstrate reinforced debt 
sustainability and fulfi  l additional risk management 
considerations established by the ECB.
4 The parameters of the programme are regularly re-
viewed and updated if necessary. For instance, on 
8 December 2016, the Governing Council of the ECB 
resolved on cutting the initial minimum remaining ma-
turity from two years to one year. In addition, pur-
chases of securities with a yield to maturity below the 
deposit facility rate were deemed permissible to the 
extent necessary.Net purchases under the asset purchase

As a result of the prohibition of monetary 
fi  nancing under Article 123 of the Treaty on 
the Functioning of the European Union, 
central banks may purchase government 
bonds on the secondary market only. In 
addition, there is a blackout period prior to 
and following an announced auction on 
the primary market before the bonds are 
available for purchase on the secondary 
market. There is an issue share limit of 33% 
per bond,5 subject to verifi  cation on a case- 
by- case basis that holding such an amount 
would not lead to Eurosystem central banks 
having a blocking minority in the event of 
an orderly restructuring of the issuer.
One of the peculiarities of the PSPP is that 
the distribution of profi  ts and possible 
losses arising from the securities purchased 
is governed by rules differing from those for 
the other programmes included in the APP . 
Under the PSPP , only 20% of the securities 
purchased are subject to joint liability at the 
Eurosystem level. This is broken down into 
purchases by the ECB (10%) and purchases 
of supranational bonds by the NCBs (10%). 
The remaining securities purchased by the 
NCBs are not subject to a regime of risk 
sharing.6
The implementation of the PSPP is based on 
a decentralised specialisation approach. Each NCB purchases public sector bonds in 
line with its share of the ECB’s capital key7 
(the Bundesbank’s current share is 25.6%), 
with each NCB only buying bonds from its 
own jurisdiction. The ECB purchases bonds 
from all jurisdictions.
The allocation of the purchase volumes in 
the PSPP is subject to a clear set of rules. 
There is no discretionary scope for tactical 
deviations to support individual govern-
ment bond markets. The monthly targets 
are based on the shares of the individual 
member states’ national bonds in the total 
volume at the end of the programme.
However, the monthly purchase volumes of 
national bonds by individual member states 
may, at times, differ from their capital key. A 
number of factors at play here are of a 
purely temporary nature. For instance, the 
Eurosystem and thus the Bundesbank, too, 
take account of the fact that market liquid-
ity can vary seasonally and that bond- 
specifi  c offer volumes may deviate from ori-
ginal expectations. In addition, all repay-
ments on holdings that have already been 
accumulated are reinvested for a period of 
three months after the due date. This can 
also lead to temporary deviations. A con-
scious decision was taken at the beginning 
of the PSPP to keep purchasing behaviour 
5 At the start of the programme, the Governing Coun-
cil of the ECB initially set the limit at 25% and subse-
quently raised it to 33% with its decision of 5 Novem-
ber 2015.
6 At the beginning of the programme, the share of 
supranational bonds stood at 12% but was then cut to 
10% in April 2016. The share of securities subject to 
joint liability remained unchanged at 20%.
7 The ECB’s capital comes from the NCBs of all mem-
ber states of the European Union (EU); each NCB’s 
share is calculated from its share in the total popula-
tion and gross domestic product of the EU. As not all 
EU member states have adopted the euro and only the 
central banks of the euro area member states have to 
pay the full amount of their capital share, the euro 
area member states thus have a higher share of the 
ECB’s actual paid- up capital than stipulated by the cap-
ital key. It is this higher modifi  ed capital share per NCB 
that is relevant for purchases under the PSPP . For more

fl  exible in this way in order to ensure the 
smooth implementation of the programme.
However, other factors cause more persist-
ent deviations from the capital key. For ex-
ample, if there is an insuffi   cient quantity of 
existing national bonds or if these bonds do 
not have the minimum rating required 
under the PSPP , the NCB concerned makes 
substitute purchases of debt instruments is-
sued by supranational institutions in order 
to fulfi  l its share of purchases based on the 
capital key. As a result, these NCBs have a 
lower share of purchases of national bonds. 
To ensure that the stipulated total volume 
of national bonds remains constant at 90% 
and the total monthly volume does not 
fl  uctuate, the relative share of national 
bonds of NCBs that do not need to conduct 
substitute purchases of supranational bonds 
automatically increases. For this reason, the 
share of German bonds in the entire PSPP 
holdings of national bonds is currently 
somewhat higher than Germany’s corres-
ponding share in the capital key. However, 
this does not mean a departure from the 
principle that purchases generally follow 
the capital key. Gearing purchases to the 
capital key refl  ects the overarching guiding 
principle to preserve a single monetary pol-
icy.
The majority of the Bundesbank’s PSPP pur-
chases on the secondary market are con-
ducted in bilateral operations whereby the 
specifi  c approach depends on the market in 
question. As a rule, before conducting a 
purchase transaction, the Bundesbank ap-
proaches a large number of counterparties 
via the common trading platforms and asks 
them to submit price quotations. In the 
case of low- volume bonds from issuers that 
are not regularly active on the capital mar-
ket (for instance, smaller federal states or 
agencies), the purchase volume is strongly 
infl  uenced by the supply of the specifi  c 
asset. In addition, the Bundesbank has re-
cently started using (twice monthly) auc-
tions to purchase less liquid securities of government agencies as well as of regional 
and local governments.
As at 30 June 2018, the Eurosystem’s hold-
ings of assets purchased under the PSPP 
had a book value of €2,068 billion, of 
which around €492 billion were German 
bonds. This means, on average, around 
€590 million net of German bonds were 
acquired  each day. Holdings have continued 
to be built up in line with the requirements 
defi  ned above. However, in the summer 
months and at the end of the year, espe-
cially, the targets – as mentioned above – 
are reduced and reallocated to other 
months in order to take account of the 
lower market liquidity.
The Bundesbank makes a certain amount of 
assets that it has purchased under the PSPP 
available for securities lending. It thereby 
helps ensure that the market for German 
Federal bonds (Bunds) remains highly liquid. 
For this purpose, it uses three demand- 
driven lending facilities. Clearstream Bank-
ing Luxembourg (CBL) offers Automated 
Securities Lending (ASL) to ensure that bor-
rowers’ trades which would otherwise fail 
are settled on the settlement date, and its 
strategic lending facility ASLplus enables 
longer- term operations (maximum term of 
35 days) to be concluded at a fi  xed min-
imum rate. In addition, the Bundesbank 
also lends its PSPP holdings via bilateral pro-
cedures. The individual design of such pro-
cedures may vary within a specifi  ed risk 
framework but the maximum term amounts 
to seven days. At present, the Bundesbank 
provides 460 different securities from the 
PSPP for lending, of which 63 are Federal 
securities. In June 2018, on average across 
all Eurosystem lending facilities, around €65 
billion worth of bonds were lent to market 
participants.Deutsche Bundesbank

credit quality and liquidity plus their benchmark 
status, German government securities re -
mained a highly relevant and attractive invest -
ment proposition for international, non-  
European investors especially. Federal securities 
also continue to play a key role for the reserve 
assets of foreign central banks.
The holder structure of Federal securities can 
be examined in detail on the basis of the Euro -
pean Securities Holdings Statistics by Sector 
(SHSS), which are collected in the Eurosystem. 
The SHSS capture both the proprietary and cus -
tomer securities holdings of all reporting 
account- keeping institutions in the euro area. 
Data from these statistics were available up to 
the end of 2017 as this article went to press. 
The SHSS do not include the holdings of the 
ECB or the euro area national central banks. 
Combined with the Bundesbank’s holdings, 
just over 95% of the total outstanding volume 
of Federal securities was captured at the end of 
2017 and assigned to the sector and country of the respective holder according to the report -
ing template shown in the table on page 21. It 
seems most investors from non- euro area 
countries also trade German government se -
curities via their own branches or authorised 
financial institutions within the euro area and 
accordingly hold the securities in safe custody 
at resident reporting custodians. One likely rea -
son for this is that better market liquidity is en -
sured during trading hours at the main trading 
venue. The SHSS thus facilitate a detailed an -
alysis of the holder structure for German gov -
ernment securities.
The Eurosystem’s purchases under the PSPP led 
to sharp shifts in the established holder struc -
ture of Federal securities. The Bundesbank built 
up holdings of just under 24% of outstanding 
German government securities up until the end 
of 2017.4 On the basis of changes in holdings 
as shown in the SHSS, it is possible to deduce 
which investor groups were net sellers in the 
market. This, in turn, illustrates the transmis -
sion channels through which the purchase pro -
gramme acts.
At the end of 2014 – that is, prior to the launch 
of the PSPP  – investors from non-  euro area 
countries held just under 60% of the outstand -
ing Federal securities.5 This high share, reflect -
ing the importance of German government se -
curities to international investors, was split 
fairly evenly between the private and public 
sectors. The public sector notably includes for -
eign central banks, which use Federal securities 
as a strategic investment (eg as reserve assets). 
Just over one- fifth was held by non- German 
euro area residents, almost all in the private 
sector. By comparison, German investors held a 
relatively small share of just under 12%. A little 
more than half of this (7%) was attributable to 
the private sector.Regional and

holdings had increased to €271 billion.

Non- euro area investors significantly scaled 
back their holdings of Federal securities be -
tween the end of 2014 and the end of 2017, 
reducing them by a total of just over 15 per -
centage points.6 Public sector holders from 
these countries had a major part to play in this 
decline. This can presumably mainly be put 
down to sales by China’s public sector. This no -
tion is backed up at the very least by the fact 
that Chinese foreign exchange reserves – the 
precise composition of which is unknown  – 
shrank by US$700 billion between the end of 
2014 and the end of 2017.7 It is unlikely that 
these sales were triggered by the start of the 
PSPP alone. Instead, they coincided with spells 
of mounting capital outflows from China, 
which also put the renminbi under pressure.8 
The remaining (private) investors from non-  
euro area countries reduced their share of Fed -
eral securities by just over 6 percentage points, 
with investors from the United States and 
United Kingdom dominating this group.9The private sector in the euro area excluding

2014, with the decrease coming to just under 
4 percentage points. Within the sector, finan -
cial investors constituted the largest investor 
group. Investment funds, in particular, initially 
increased their shares in Federal securities in 
the run- up to, and at the start of, the asset pur -
chase programme before subsequently becom -
ing net sellers from 2016 onwards and redu -
cing their shares to just over 7% at last count. 
However, insurance corporations’ and pension 
funds’ share in Federal securities rose to a little 
more than 8%, leading them to supplant in -
vestment funds as the largest investor group 
among financial investors. By contrast, banks 
from the euro area excluding Germany consid -
erably reduced their comparatively small share, 
even establishing a small net short position at 
the end of 2017, on aggregate. A similar pic -
ture emerges for German private investors. As 
is the case with the other euro area investors, 
insurance corporations’ and pension funds’ 
share remained broadly constant, whereas do -
mestic banks scaled back their holdings over 
this period.
Viewed as a global aggregate, the private sec -
tor’s behaviour was fairly homogeneous. Pri -
vate financial and non- financial investors, re -
gardless of their home region, have made simi -
lar cutbacks to their percentage shares in Fed -
eral securities since the launch in the PSPP 
(between the end of 2014 and end of 2017). 
Relative to the holdings at the end of 2014, the 
decline in the private sector ranged from 19% 
(euro area excluding Germany) through 20% 
(non- euro area countries) to 23% (Germany).
When broken down by sector, the figures for 
the private sector show that private financial 
investors behaved very heterogeneously. There 
were significant portfolio shifts. Euro area 
banks, for example, reduced their percentage 
shares in Federal securities almost completely 
(-86%), whereas investment funds made only 
slight changes (-10%). Insurance corporations 
and pension funds, on the other hand, even 
upped their shares (+7%).10 These varied reac -
tions can also be explained by institutional fac -tors. Unlike the other two sectors, euro area 
banks have access to the deposit facility, which 
can be a cheaper and safe alternative to invest -
ing in Federal securities.11 In this sense, the 
PSPP also had an impact within the euro area 
via sectoral portfolio adjustments. Based on 
(absolute) transaction volumes, the portfolio 
effect was by far the greatest amongst invest -
ors from non- euro area countries.12 In keeping 
with this, the share of absolute sales was low in 
the euro area private sector, on account of the 
small share of just under 27% of the outstand -
ing volume prior to the launch of the PSPP . For 
the non- euro area countries, the reallocations 
could also have spread to affect exchange rate 
developments, in cases where bond sellers 
shifted into other currencies.13
The share of freely tradable bonds (free float) 
declined under the PSPP . If free float is defined 
as the stock available to the private sector ex -
cept for pension funds and insurance corpor -
ations, the volume of securities in free float 
came to less than 40% at the end of 2017.14 
This represents a decrease of just over 10 per -
centage points during the purchase pro -
gramme, which may affect general availability 
and market liquidity.Signs that port -

how the individual sectors have adjusted their portfolios 
overall (portfolio rebalancing) under the influence of the 
PSPP .
12 There is no sectoral breakdown for investors from non-

holds under the assumption that private financial investors 
from non- euro area countries and from the euro area 
reacted in similar ways.

able for trading. It is not possible to gain a clear and com -

one thing, the banking sector is also required by regulation

tend to be more yield- focused, but are not distinguished 
from reserve assets in the SHSS.Deutsche Bundesbank

Federal Government issuance activities and procedures
In Germany, the Federal Ministry of Finance 
is responsible for the Federal Government’s 
debt management. The primary close- to- 
market and operational debt management 
tasks include managing Federal Govern-
ment borrowing and liquidity, which has 
been entrusted to Federal Republic of Ger-
many – Finance Agency (referred to here as 
the “Finance Agency”) in Frankfurt am Main 
since June 2001. The Federal Government, 
represented by the Federal Ministry of 
Finance , is the sole shareholder of the Fi-
nance Agency. The main task of the Finance 
Agency is to provide timely, cost- effective 
and low- risk debt management services for 
the Federal Government, in particular 
through the initial issuance of securities in 
the primary market. At the same time, the 
Finance Agency’s work is intended to ce-
ment and further extend the status of Ger-
many’s Federal Government as a bench-
mark issuer in the euro area.
Bundesbank the government’s fi  scal 
agent
As the government’s fi  scal agent, the Bun-
desbank performs technical debt manage-
ment duties for the Federal Government, 
conducting auctions of Federal securities, 
carrying out market management oper-
ations on the German stock exchanges, and 
settling the Federal Government’s securities 
transactions. These tasks are completed on 
behalf of and for the account of the Federal 
Government in coordination with the Fi-
nance Agency. It should be noted that, as 
the Federal Government’s fi  scal agent, the 
Bundesbank provides banking services 
which are strictly separate from its monet-
ary and foreign exchange policy tasks. The 
Bundesbank does not grant loans when 
auctioning Federal securities in the primary market, nor does it take Federal securities 
into its own portfolio. On account of its fi  s-
cal agent role, the same applies to second-
ary market transactions.
Auctions: the main primary market 
 procedure
The primary market is where securities are 
issued for the fi  rst time. It is where the Fed-
eral Government covers more than 90% of 
its annual borrowing requirements by issu-
ing Federal securities in auctions. The Fed-
eral Government only commissions a bank 
syndicate as an alternative channel for issu-
ing Federal securities for a handful of spe-
cial Federal securities, such as the two US 
dollar- denominated bonds which were is-
sued in 2005 and 2009 and have since 
been repaid.
Issuance planning
Market participants and investors value an 
issuer’s continuity, transparency and reliabil-
ity, and this ultimately pays off for the bor-
rower in the form of favourable borrowing 
conditions. Auctions of Federal securities 
planned by the Federal Government over 
the course of a calendar year are therefore 
announced by the Finance Agency at the 
end of the previous year in an annual issu-
ance calendar. The annual preview contains 
precise details on the Federal securities 
which will be put up for auction, such as 
the auction date, the planned issuance vol-
ume and the exact maturity date. Addition-
ally, a quarterly issuance calendar is pub-
lished, which may contain deviations from 
the annual preview. As an issuer, the Fed-
eral Government strives to conduct its an-
nounced issuance activities according to its 
published schedules. However, these plans Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
July 2018  
23

may need to be adjusted if borrowing re-
quirements, the Federal Government’s li-
quidity position, or the capital market situ-
ation as a whole change signifi  cantly during 
the course of the year.
Maturity profi  le
The Federal Government’s commitment to 
continuity and reliability means offering 
Federal securities with an overall balanced 
maturity profi  le. First, it weighs the gener-
ally lower borrowing costs of revolving 
short- term debt against the certainty that 
borrowing in the long- term maturity seg-
ment can offer. Second, it takes into ac-
count the fact that offering a broad spec-
trum of maturities on a regular basis allows 
investors to invest in accordance with their 
respective duration goals. That way, the 
Federal Government can be sure of attract-
ing a broad investor base. This is why Fed-
eral securities are put up for auction across 
all maturities: six- month Treasury discount 
paper (“Bubills”) in the money market seg-
ment, and in the capital market segment, 
two- year Federal Treasury notes (“Schätze”), 
fi  ve- year Federal notes (“Bobls”) and main-
stay ten- year and thirty- year Federal bonds 
(“Bunds”). Infl  ation- linked Federal securities 
(“Bund- Linker”) are also auctioned on a 
regular basis.
Bund Issues Auction Group
Members of the Bund Issues Auction Group, 
who have been approved by the Finance 
Agency, are eligible to bid in Federal Gov-
ernment auctions. The group currently 
comprises 36 credit institutions and invest-
ment fi  rms which are established in a mem-
ber state of the European Union. To remain 
in the auction group, members must sub-
scribe to at least 0.05% of the total issu-
ance allotted, weighted by maturity, in auc-
tions in any one calendar year. Member in-stitutions which fail to subscribe to this 
minimum share are required to leave the 
group at the end of the year. Apart from 
the minimum share requirement, members 
have no additional obligations. For instance, 
they are not expected to provide any mar-
ket making services in the secondary mar-
ket – ie quote bid and ask prices for Federal 
securities or provide mandatory reporting 
and advisory services for the issuer. On 
30 June and 31 December each year, the 
Finance Agency publishes a list ranking 
Bund Issues Auction Group members by 
their share of the weighted issuance vol-
ume allotted, without quoting percentages.
Operational implementation
Federal Government auctions take place on 
the Bund Bidding System (BBS) electronic 
auction platform provided by the Bundes-
bank. The Bundesbank is responsible for 
technical implementation of the auction 
process; in other words, it announces the 
auction and the invitation to bid, monitors 
bidders’ submissions on the day of the auc-
tion and publishes the auction results. The 
Finance Agency and the Federal Ministry of 
Finance both have direct links to the BBS, 
and they make the economic decisions – ie 
they determine the allotment conditions 
such as allotment prices and volumes on 
the day of the auction. Once the deadline 
for bids has passed, it is generally the case 
that the allotment decision is made and the 
auction results are announced via the BBS 
and fi  nancial information providers within 
the space of two minutes.
Auction procedure
Allotment is based on what is known as the 
multiple price method, meaning that the 
accepted price bids are allotted at the price 
specified in the respective bid. Non- 
competitive bids are fi  lled at the weighted Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
July 2018  
24

average price of the bids accepted. Bids 
above the lowest price accepted are allot-
ted in full; those below the lowest price ac-
cepted are not considered. Bids at the low-
est price accepted and non- competitive 
bids can be allotted pro rata – in other 
words, bids can also be fi  lled here, albeit 
only to a limited extent. March 2018 saw 
the Federal Government use the BBS’s new 
multi- ISIN auction functionality for the fi  rst 
time. This enables multiple Federal secur-
ities to be offered to investors in parallel as 
part of a single auction.
Secondary market activities
The Finance Agency sets aside a share of 
the securities issued in each auction as pro-
prietary holdings of the Federal Govern-
ment for secondary market operations. This 
amount is not defi  ned in advance and var-
ies from one auction to the next. On aver-
age, around 20% of the issuance volume is 
set aside for this purpose. Following the 
auction, these securities are gradually fed 
into the market by the Finance Agency in 
the context of secondary market activities. 
As a result, counterparties can still purchase 
Federal securities from the issuer after they 
have been issued in the primary market. In 
addition, the issuer might fi  nd it benefi  cial 
to smooth its borrowing to a degree over 
time. However, secondary market activities 
also include secondary market operations 
on the German stock exchanges, which en-
tail the Bundesbank buying and selling 
listed Federal securities for the Federal Gov-
ernment’s account. These operations aim to 
achieve fair prices which do not discrimin-
ate between different market participants 
(nor between institutional investors and re-
tail customers) and to maintain liquid trad-
ing with low bid- ask spreads. The Bundes-
bank assists in setting a “Bundesbank refer-
ence price” on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange 
for every listed Federal security on every trading day, which provides an important 
benchmark, especially for the retail busi-
ness. This institutional framework plays a 
part in ensuring that Federal securities can 
be traded at robust prices that are in line 
with the market every trading day.
The Federal Government’s proprietary hold-
ings can also be used by the Finance Agency 
to collateralise securities repurchase agree-
ments (repos) and interest rate swap trans-
actions, as well as for securities lending. 
The Federal Government’s securities trans-
actions are settled via the cash and safe 
custody accounts it maintains with the Bun-

Scarcity premiums for 
 short-term bonds
Federal securities have become more scarce for 
the private sector as a direct side effect of the 
asset purchase programmes, and their prices 
have risen. A key question is which investor 
group is willing to pay the scarcity premiums 
on Federal securities.
Here, the scarcity premium is defined as the 
spread between interest rates on swap con -
tracts pegged to the Eonia (“Eonia swap rates” 
for short) and yields on matched- maturity 
Bunds.15 It is worth comparing these two inter -
est rates because Eonia, being the reference 
interest rate for swap contracts, is an average 
rate for overnight money in euro interbank 
transactions which is calculated on the basis of 
actual transactions. Owing to its short maturity 
of one day, overnight money has negligible de -
fault risk. An interest rate spread between the two instruments therefore does not stem ma -
terially from different levels of credit quality. 
However, contracts based on Eonia swap rates 
cannot be used as stores of value – unlike gov -
ernment bonds, which are considered safe. 
This is because, during the term of the con -
tract, only the net interest cash flows based on 
the notional amount (which is not invested) are 
swapped. The spread between the Eonia swap 
rate and bond yield thus also contains a pre -
mium for the scarcity of safe investments in 
times of high excess liquidity.
By way of example, the scarcity premium can 
be illustrated by the yield spread between 
two-year Eonia swap rates and the yield in the 
two- year maturity category. It is apparent that 
there is a close connection between Eonia 
swap rates and bond yields over a longer hori -
zon. But what is striking is that in 2016 only the 
yield on two-  year Bunds systematically fell, 
leading to the yield spread between the two 
instruments widening to 60 basis points at its 
peak by early 2017.
Possible reasons for this wider spread include 
the relevant liquidity regulations for banks 
( Basel  III) and the European Market Infrastruc -
ture Regulation (EMIR), which, taken in isol -
ation, could have induced stronger and rela -
tively price- inelastic demand for short- term Greater scarcity

15 The Eonia (euro overnight index average) is closely 
linked to the Eurosystem’s key interest rates because, in 
times of a structural liquidity deficit, it is heavily geared to -
wards the main refinancing rate or – in times of high excess 
liquidity – towards the deposit rate. Interest rate swaps are 
contracts in which two counterparties agree to exchange a 
series of fixed interest cash flows for floating interest cash 
flows at predefined future points in time. The interest cash 
flows stem from an underlying (but uninvested) amount of 
money and the agreed fixed and floating interest rates, 
with the level of the floating interest rate being adjusted at 
predefined future points in time over the term of the con -
tract. The fixed interest rate is agreed between the counter -
parties at the beginning of the contract such that the 
present value of the net payment is zero.Deutsche Bundesbank

bonds amongst institutional investors.16 This 
effect is mitigated by the fact that central bank 
liquidity can also count towards regulatory re -
quirements and excess liquidity has increased 
under the PSPP . This is why investors without 
access to the deposit facility, in particular, are 
more loath to part with Federal securities. They 
are willing to pay higher prices for these secur -
ities and to accept lower yields. Additionally, 
the Finance Agency reduced its previously 
planned issue volume owing to the sound 
budgetary position in the final quarter of 2016.
The Eurosystem’s asset purchase programmes 
have probably increased the scarcity of Federal 
securities across almost all maturities, with 
both direct and indirect effects likely to be play -
ing a role. The direct effects include purchases 
of short, medium and long- term German gov -
ernment securities under the PSPP .
Indirect effects are likely to hit short- term se -
curities first and foremost; they are connected 
with the mounting excess liquidity caused by 
the purchase programmes. It is presumed that 
chiefly market participants without access to 
the deposit facility – ie non- MFIs and the in -
vestors from non- euro area countries that 
dominate among sellers – invest funds in short- 
term Federal securities. MFIs appear to offer in -
stitutional investors such poor terms for de -
posits in times of high excess liquidity that the 
investors prefer to park their funds directly in 
Federal securities. Furthermore, investors with 
no access to the deposit facility also, of their 
own accord, avoid concentration risk stem -
ming from bank deposits with individual insti -
tutions and invest funds in short- term Federal 
securities instead.
This assumption is backed up by the holder 
structure. In the case of Federal securities with 
an original maturity of up to two years, there 
was a considerable percentage rise in the share 
of non- euro area investors (without access to 
the deposit facility) over the duration of the 
asset purchase programme, although the share 
of non- euro area countries’ holdings of all Fed -eral securities fell over the same period.17 By 
contrast, euro area banks with access to the 
deposit facility reduced their holdings of short- 
term Federal paper. This means that some 
banks, unlike insurers, took advantage of the 
high prices of Federal securities to collect the 
yield spread between Federal securities and 
the expected rate of return on funds in the de -
posit facility. As mentioned above, the interest 
rate spread between Federal securities and the 
Eonia  swap rate is also attributable to institu -
tional factors in that the banking system does

16 One regulatory ratio for banks is the liquidity coverage 
ratio (LCR). The LCR is a balance sheet ratio of unencum -
bered high quality liquid assets (HQLA) –  which include 
Federal securities – to total assets. The LCR was phased in 
over time. The harmonised liquidity requirement for banks 
has applied EU- wide since 1 October 2015. Another ratio 
used in banking supervision is the structural liquidity ratio 
(or net stable funding ratio (NSFR)). It is defined as the ratio 
of sustainable funding (including equity capital and long-  
term liabilities) over the required stable funding. However, 
the NSFR rule only entered into force after the period ana -
lysed here. The EU regulation on OTC derivatives, central 
counterparties and trade repositories (European Market In -
frastructure Regulation, or EMIR) of 2012 also contains 
rules on OTC derivatives trading. It requires open deriva -
tives positions, ie positions where claims and liabilities have 
not yet been settled, to be collateralised – for example, by 
government bonds or cash deposits. The regulation 
entered into force on 1 September 2017 and will be phased 
in up until 1 September 2020.

tional investors when excess liquidity levels are 
high, thus pressuring them, by way of un -
attractive overall conditions, into investing in 
Federal securities. For the reasons given above, 
the observed scarcity premium probably de -
clines in an environment of receding excess li -
quidity.
Market liquidity in the 
 context of the purchase 
 programmes
High market liquidity is important for the effect -
ive implementation of the PSPP . However, the 
decline in Federal securities in free float reduced 
the volumes available for trading and thus, 
potentially  , market liquidity. However, market 
liquidity   is a multifaceted concept, and aca -
demic researchers, market participants and pol -
icymakers have yet to reach a consensus on 
how to measure it. Typically, there are three 
dimensions  of market liquidity: “width” (cost of 
executing a trade at a given volume), “depth” 
(the tradable volume at a given price) and 
“resiliency ” (the half- life of random price fluctu -
ations). In view of the complexity of the con -
cept, no individual ratio covers all aspects of 
market liquidity.
Federal securities trading activity has been in 
decline since the 2000s, notably due to the ef -
fects of the financial and economic crisis. In the 
spot market, according to Finance Agency stat -
istics, annual gross trading volumes transacted 
by the members of the Bund Issues Auction 
Group fell from more than €7,000 billion in 
2005 to less than €5,000 billion in 2017.18 
Although  the outstanding bond volume rose 
from 2005 onwards, 2016 saw the lowest trad -
ing volume in the spot market. The PSPP may 
also have played a part in this development. In 
the Eurex futures market, the volume of futures 
contracts with Federal securities as the under -
lying has also been lower since the financial cri -
sis. Against this backdrop, trading in both the 
spot and futures markets has also grown some -
what more fragmented. This is borne out by the fact that trades have involved increasingly 
smaller transaction volumes over time. In par -
ticular, large transactions have become more 
expensive and thus less frequent.
Quantitative analyses are made more difficult 
by the fact that bonds are mostly traded over- 
the- counter (OTC); in other words, trading is 
conducted in a decentralised manner directly 
between market participants. Compared with 
listed shares, bond trading is therefore more 
fragmented, and scarcely any data on prices 
and volumes are available that are representa -
tive of the market. In addition to traditional bi -
lateral telephone trading, more and more OTC 
transactions are being conducted on electronic 
trading platforms.
Individual operators of electronic trading plat -
forms use a central order book with limits 
(known as a limit order book) to settle bond 
purchases. Buying and selling bids with the re -
spective prices and quantities are collected in 
these limit order books. Since every bid is bind -
ing, a robust picture of the market is obtained 
which allows in- depth analyses. However, rela -
tively low volumes are traded on trading plat -
forms compared with OTC trading, which 
means that the results need to be put into per -
spective.
A ratio known as order book illiquidity, which 
can be determined on the basis of information 
on the limit order book, is of interest when 
analysing liquidity. This ratio contains the li -
quidity dimensions width in the numerator and 
depth in the denominator. The width of the 
order book corresponds to the average bid- ask 
spread of the five closest buy and sell orders. 
The depth of the order book, meanwhile, is de -
rived from the total volume of these five bid 
and ask prices, respectively. Order book illiquid -

decline.19 This makes it more informative than 
a simple spread of the bid and ask prices that 
are closest together.
In the data used here, which are from the trad -
ing platform MTS (Mercato telematico dei Titoli 
di Stato) for the period from January 2014 to 
the end of June 2018, the difference between 
the simple bid- ask spread (between the best 
buying and selling price) and the order book 
illiquidity becomes clear. The simple bid- ask 
spread shows no clear trend. In contrast to this 
simple spread, it may be seen that the order 
book illiquidity for ten-  year Bunds increased 
from the beginning of 2016. This was primarily 
due to the decline in order book depth. The 
corresponding width across the five best prices 
increased only slightly. The calculations based 
on the order book entries thus confirm the in -
dications that the market liquidity for larger 
trading volumes has deteriorated.20
Spikes in the simple bid- ask spread as well as in 
order book illiquidity were found at the end of 
both 2016 and 2017. These spikes coincide 
with strong negative secured money market 
rates in the repo market over the balance sheet 
dates. However, these year- end effects were of 
a rather temporary nature and had no lasting 
impact on the repo market itself or on the li -
quidity of the government bond market. Ultim -
ately, the Eurosystem’s securities lending facil -
ities, through which a certain amount of the 
securities purchased by the Eurosystem are 
made available for securities lending, are likely 
to have also contributed to this.21 The lending 
plays a part in the fact that when demand for a 
specific paper is high, its supply can be tempor -
arily increased. In this way, the market for Ger -
man Federal securities as a whole can be kept 
highly liquid (see the box on pages 17 to 19).
There is no indication of a fundamental impair -
ment of the effective functioning of the market 
as a result of the PSPP in the segment con -
sidered here of recently issued (“on- the- run”) 
bonds. Only in connection with larger trading 
volumes have some cases of deteriorating li -quidity been observed since 2016. Beyond the 
on- the- run bonds considered here, there are 
also signs that the depth and resiliency of 
liquidity  decrease in bonds purchased by the 
central bank, particularly older ones.22
Factors affecting the 
 development of Bund yields
In the period after the PSPP was launched, li -
quidity and scarcity premiums rose somewhat 
on the whole in the Bund market. However, it 
is important for monetary policy to identify 
general macro, financial market and economic 
variables which have an impact on Bund yields. 
For this reason, it makes sense to take a some -Increase in order

what longer view in order to examine factors 
affecting the development of Bund yields be -
yond the PSPP . To this end, the previously men -
tioned special developments arising in connec -
tion with the PSPP (scarcity and liquidity pre -
mium) are also taken into consideration. In 
addition, factors such as monetary policy as a 
whole (interest rate movements and PSPP), 
international effects and safe haven flows are 
also looked at more closely.
In conjunction with global interest rates, Bund 
yields fell considerably overall in the last few 
years. Yields also rose strongly at times, how -
ever. Two examples of phases of strongly in -
creasing yields are the taper tantrum in the 
United States in 2013, which also affected 
Bund yields, and the Bund tantrum in spring 
2015. The following analysis therefore also 
examines the extent to which the selected de -
terminants may, during the two tantrum 
phases, have given rise to special factors which 
contributed to the temporary surges in yields.
The following individual factors are taken into 
account:
– According to the expectations hypothesis of 
the term structure, the slope of the Eonia 
swap rate curve at the short end, calculated 
as the two- year Eonia swap rate minus the 
one- month Eonia swap rate (Slope_Eonia), is 
an indicator of future changes to short- term 
interest rates over the next two years and 
thus also of the expected path of future key 
interest rates.23 Because central banks take 
economic activity and price developments 
into account when setting interest rate pol -
icy, this could indirectly also reflect the eco -
nomic and inflation outlook. The slope of 
the Eonia swap rate curve is expected to 
have a positive impact on the (ten- year) 
Bund yield (Bund_Interest).
– The interest rate relationship with the United 
States is measured in terms of the yield of 
ten- year US  Treasuries (US_Interest). US 
yields lagged by one stock exchange trading day are used to capture a potential impact 
of US yields on Bund yields in order to allow 
for the time difference between the USA 
and Germany. The impact of US yields is ex -
pected to be positive.
– The particularly high market liquidity of 
Bunds is measured as the difference be -
tween the yield of bonds issued by public 
promotional banks, such as Kreditanstalt für 
Wiederaufbau  (KfW), and German Bunds. 
This means that, in contrast to the bid- ask 
spread, it is not an absolute but a relative 
measure of market liquidity. This measure 
takes into account not only the particularly 
high market liquidity of ten- year benchmark 
bonds, but also the general, maturity-  
independent liquidity advantage of Bunds. 
To this end, first the yield spread between 
the bonds of public promotional banks and 
Bunds is calculated for every full- year matur -
ity between one and ten years.24 A principal 
component analysis is then carried out to 
calculate the first principal component of 
the maturity- specific spreads, which then 
serves as a measure of the maturity-  
independent liquidity premium of Bunds 
(PC_Liquidity).25 It is expected to have a 
negative impact on Bund yields.
– A potential scarcity of Bunds is interpreted 
as a response to excess demand which, like 
the liquidity premium, drives yields below Bund yields 
down consider -
ably overall, but 
yields also up at 
times

23 According to the expectations theory of the term struc -
ture, the long- term interest rate is dependent only on the 
current short- term interest rate and the expected future 
short- term interest rates, whereas possible term premiums 
are disregarded. As term premiums play only a minor role 
in the short- term maturity spectrum, the slope of the yield 
curve in this segment probably mainly reflects the expected 
path of the short- term interest rate. This is in line, for ex -
ample, with empirical evidence on US swap rates; see

the expectation and risk premium in the OIS term structure,

lic promotional banks. The yield spreads can therefore only 
be calculated for the other full- year maturities.

the risk- free interest rate. The resulting scar -
city premiums are reflected, for example, in 
the repo market26 and in the difference be -
tween Eonia swap rates and Bund yields, 
which was discussed above in connection 
with the holder structure. In order to quan -
tify general, maturity-  independent scarcity 
premiums, the difference between the re -
spective Eonia swap rates (as a measure of 
the risk- free interest rate) and Bund yields is 
calculated for each full- year maturity be -
tween one and ten years. As a measure of 
the scarcity premium, the first principal com -
ponent of these maturity- specific Eonia 
spreads is factored into the estimation (PC_
Scarcity).27 It should have a negative impact 
on yields.28
– Lastly, the estimation takes into account the 
possible impact on Bund yields that may re -
sult from portfolio shifts by investors follow -
ing a change in equity market uncertainty. 
The VDAX volatility index, which measures 
the implied volatility of the DAX calculated 
from options, is used as a measure of equity 
market uncertainty. The VDAX should have a 
negative effect on Bund yields.
This estimation is based on daily data, whereby 
all of the variables are measured in first differ -
ences in order to rule out the possibility of non- 
stationarity. The observation period from the 
beginning of 2012 until 23  May 2018 is se -
lected such that it covers the impact of the sov -
ereign debt crisis as well as the two tantrum 
phases. In order to avoid autocorrelation in the 
residuals, all estimations are supplemented by a 
lagged term for the Bund yield.
The selected determinants explain 65% of the 
total dispersion of Bund yields.29 All of the esti -
mated coefficients have the expected sign and 
are significant at least at the 5% level (Esti -
mate 1 in the table on page 32). The results 
suggest that the scarcity premiums and the 
slope of the Eonia swap rate curve both have a 
particularly important impact. In order to assess 
the strength of the effects, it is useful to stand -ardise the estimated coefficients such that they 
reflect the impact on the dependent variable in 
standard deviations. A standardisation of this 
kind reveals that an increase in the scarcity pre -
miums by one standard deviation lowers the 
Bund yield by 0.48 of a standard deviation. A 
slightly weaker (positive) effect (0.40 of a 
standard deviation) is derived for the slope of 
the Eonia swap rate curve.30
The reported effect of the scarcity premiums, 
which have risen considerably since the begin -
ning of 2016, implies that they dampened 
yields in the last two years in particular. This 
effect apparently stemmed from scarcity pre -
miums not only in the ten- year maturity seg -
ment but also at the shorter end, where the 
scarcity was particularly pronounced. Possible 
reasons for this are the above- mentioned 
growth in demand among institutional invest -
ors in a number of maturity segments, the Eu -
rosystem’s increased holdings as well as the 
rising levels of excess liquidity in the banking 
system.
The strong influence also exerted by the slope 
of the Eonia swap rate curve at the short end 
underlines the importance of expectations re -… Eonia swap

26 In the repo market, repo rates below the deposit rate, 
for example, indicate scarcity premiums on the underlying 
Bunds. The scarcity of an individual bond is expressed, 
moreover, in its specialness premium. This represents the 
difference between the repo rate for the general collateral 
trade (where the collateral is only required to meet general 
quality standards) and the repo rate for the specific collat -
eral (where a specific individual bond constitutes the collat -
eral).
27 The first principal component explains 89% of the total 
variance.
28 In addition to the other full- year Bund yields, yields on 
ten- year Bunds are also factored into the measures used 
for the maturity- independent scarcity and liquidity pre -
miums (the first principal components) in each case. An 
endogeneity problem cannot therefore be categorically 
ruled out. As this impact is relatively low for both meas -
ures, however, the possibility of such an endogeneity prob -
lem appears to be negligible.
29 Including the lagged value for the Bund yield in the es -
timation equation is immaterial for the coefficient of deter -
mination. This is demonstrated by a further estimation 
without a lagged Bund yield, with robust standard errors 
(Newey-  West method).

the standard deviations also refer to the differences in the 
variables.Deutsche Bundesbank

garding the future path of key interest rates 
over the next two years. This applies not only 
to the monetary policy environment up until 
the end of 2014, which was characterised by 
falling central bank interest rates, but also to 
the period thereafter, when central bank rates 
were already close to zero and unconventional 
measures shaped monetary policy.31
Compared with the scarcity premiums and the 
monetary policy stance, US yields and liquidity 
premiums constitute weaker, yet still import -
ant, determinants of Bund yields.32 The re -
ported impact of US yields illustrates the im -
portance of international capital flows and of 
the transatlantic interest rate linkage. As US 
yields lagged by one day are used for the esti -
mation, the reported impact also implies a 
leading indicator property of US interest rates, 
which are reflected in Bund yields with a time

the VDAX has a weaker impact on Bund 
yields.34 However, that does not rule out the possibility that demand for Bunds as a safe 
haven is particularly strong in periods of height -
ened uncertainty (see the box on pages  33

How safe haven effects impact on Bund yields – 
a SVAR analysis
Times of crisis tend to depress the yields of 
German Federal bonds (Bunds) as investors 
often take fl  ight to “safe havens” where 
they can evade the heightened uncertainty. 
But Bund yields are not the only variables 
that adjust in response to critical situations 
– other macroeconomic and fi  nancial vari-
ables are also affected, and in some cases 
interdependencies exist as well. Structural 
vector autoregression (SVAR) models can be 
used to shed light on these adjustment pro-
cesses from an econometric vantage point.
Risk- averse households respond to a sud-
den onset of heightened uncertainty1 sur-
rounding future economic developments by 
reducing expenditure and building up fi  nan-
cial buffers (precautionary saving effect). 
Enterprises, meanwhile, are more reluctant 
to make investments (eg real options effect) 
or hire new employees, with the result that 
they largely retain the revenue they earn.2 
The ultimate outcome of these two effects 
is a weakening of real economic activity 
with something of a time lag. Funding con-
ditions might also tighten (fi  nancial con-
straints). Unlike real economic variables, 
prices and quantities in fi  nancial markets 
respond immediately to episodes of height-
ened uncertainty because investors instantly 
step up their demand for safe yet liquid al-
ternatives. They also tend to switch be-
tween asset classes as securities generating 
more volatile cash fl  ows in a less certain 
economic backdrop fall out of favour com-
pared with assets with steady and reliable 
disbursement profi  les. This response to 
heightened uncertainty is known as the 
fl  ight to safety or quality, and also as safe 
haven fl  ows.Government bonds normally account for 
the bulk of safe (and liquid) securities.3 As a 
result, a fl  ight to safety event will typically 
depress the prices of equities, say, and push 
up government bond prices, thus reducing 
their yields.4 To study the impact of an un-
expected fl  ight to safety event on Bund 
yields, it is important to account for any 
interdependencies that might exist between 
a given uncertainty measure, fi  nancial mar-
ket variables and real economic variables. 
For example, (unexpected) monetary policy 
1 Strictly speaking, uncertainty denotes the inability of 
economic agents to determine a probability distribu-
tion for uncertain future events – ie they are unable to 
assign specifi  c probabilities to a potential set of events. 
This is where uncertainty differs from risk, where eco-
nomic agents are aware of, or can at least estimate, a 
probability distribution over a set of events. See 
N Bloom (2014), Fluctuations in uncertainty, Journal of 
Economic Perspectives 28(2), pp 153-176. As discussed 
in Bloom (2014), the term “uncertainty” will be used in 
this box text more as a combination of these two con-
cepts, given the empirical diffi   culties involved in distin-
guishing them from one another.
2 See N  Bloom (2009), The impact of uncertainty 
shocks, Econometrica 77(3), pp 626-685; and S Basu 
and B Bundick (2017), Uncertainty shocks in a model 
of effective demand, Econometrica 85(3), pp 937-958. 
For more on how elevated aggregate uncertainty im-
pacts on enterprises’ cash holdings, see J Gao, Y Grin-
stein and W Wang (2017), Cash holdings, precaution-
ary motives, and systematic uncertainty, Indiana Uni-
versity.
3 An increase in money market instruments (such as 
transferable deposits) is another factor in this regard. 
See L  Baele, G  Bekaert, K  Inghelbrecht and M  Wei 
(2013), Flights to safety, NBER  Working Paper 
No 19095.
4 See R B Barsky (1989), Why don’t the prices of stocks

view 79(5), pp 1132-1145; or G Bekaert, E Engstrom 
and Y Xing (2009), Risk, uncertainty and asset prices, 
Journal of Financial Economics 91(1), pp 59-82. An-
other term used frequently in spells of heightened 
fi  nancial  market stress is “fl  ight to liquidity”. Flights to 
liquidity can also be observed during bouts of elevated 
market uncertainty, in the form of portfolio realloca-
tions into highly liquid securities, which particularly in-
clude government bonds. See D Vayanos (2004), Flight 
to quality, fl  ight to liquidity, and the pricing of risk, 
NBER Working Paper No 10327. It is not always pos-
sible to clearly distinguish fl  ights to liquidity from 
fl  ights to safety, which is why fl  ights to liquidity are 
often included in the fl  ight to safety category.Deutsche Bundesbank

decisions might also have a bearing on un-
certainty.5 Furthermore, there is a strong 
correlation between the fi  nancial risk which 
fi  nancial intermediaries are willing to bear, 
on the one hand, and uncertainty, on the 
other.6 Thus, if the uncertainty measure is 
used in isolation to explain yields without 
considering potential interdependencies, 
one might conclude – incorrectly – that a 
fl  ight to safety event has occurred. The aim, 
then, is to identify an unexpected increase 
in uncertainty (an exogenous uncertainty 
shock) as a factor driving the fl  ight to safety. 
Hence the use of a structural vector autore-
gression (SVAR) model, as it is known, as an 
econometric methodology, which explicitly 
considers interdependencies between vari-
ables and is capable of depicting the dy-
namic processes of adjustment to econom-
ically interpretable innovations (shocks).7
The uncertainty measure used in this analy-
sis is the VIX implied volatility index derived 
from options on the S&P 500, a broad US 
equity index.8 Other variables included in 
the SVAR after the VIX are industrial pro-
duction for the euro area (in logs), the rate 
of infl  ation for the euro area, the Euro Stoxx 
equity index (in logs), the yield of corporate 
bonds,9 the short- term shadow rate,10 the 
yield of ten- year Austrian government 
bonds, and the yield on ten- year Bunds. 
The observation period begins in January 
2007, ie before the onset of the fi  nancial 
crisis, and ends in March 2018.11 All vari-
ables are included at a monthly frequency.12 
The chosen ordering – putting macroeco-
nomic variables ahead of interest rates and 
fi  nancial market variables – is standard in 5 See G Bekaert, M Hoerova and M Lo Duca (2013), 
Risk, uncertainty and monetary policy, Journal of Mon-
etary Policy 60(7), pp 771-788. The authors show that 
an unexpected accommodative monetary policy meas-
ure (expansionary monetary policy shock) reduces un-
certainty.
6 Hence the need to distinguish between fi  nancial 
shocks and uncertainty shocks. See D  Caldara, 
C Fuentes- Albero, S Gilchrist and E Zakrajšek (2016), 
The macroeconomic impact of fi  nancial and uncer-
tainty shocks, European Economic Review 88, pp 185-
207.
7 The identifi  cation scheme is the Cholesky decompos-
ition, which assumes that shocks to a variable affect all 
the other variables ordered afterwards in the same 
period, but only have a lagged impact on variables 
ordered beforehand.
8 Implied equity market volatility generally includes 
both uncertainty and risk aversion. However, since un-
certainty dominates the variance in implied equity mar-
ket volatility, it would appear that implied equity mar-
ket volatility is a good proxy for uncertainty. See G Ba-
kaert, M Hoerova and M Lo Duca (2013), op cit; and 
G Bekaert and M Hoerova (2014), The VIX, the vari-
ance premium and stock market volatility, Journal of 
Econometrics 13(2), pp  181-192. It is nonetheless 
worth noting that the measure used here for uncer-
tainty also includes risk aversion. The reason for using 
the US equity market here is that the US has the most 
signifi  cant capital market worldwide. The VIX is, how-
ever, highly correlated with the implied volatility for 
the DAX (VDAX- NEW) or the Euro Stoxx (VStoxx).
9 The iBoxx non- fi  nancials BBB index for bonds with a 
residual maturity of between seven and ten years is 
used.

L Krippner (2015), Zero lower bound term structure 
modelling: a practitioner’s guide, New York, Palgrave 
Macmillan US. They are also discussed in Deutsche 
Bundesbank, Monetary policy indicators at the lower

measures
11 The end of the observation period is determined by 
data availability constraints. The shadow rate and the 
yields on corporate bonds, Austrian government bonds 
and Bunds all follow a clear downward trend during 
the observation period. This is derived using a Hodrick- 
Prescott fi  lter. The SVAR therefore provides an explan-
ation for deviations from this downward trend. The 
trend itself cannot be explained by the approach 
chosen. Further information on explanatory ap-
proaches for the trend can be found in Deutsche Bun-
desbank, The natural rate of interest, Monthly Report, 
October 2017, pp 27-42.
12 This means that fl  ight to safety events which are 
more protracted and therefore feed through to real 
economic variables can be identifi  ed better. Using data 
at shorter intervals will tend to capture short- term 
fl  ight to liquidity events. Monthly averages derived 
from daily data are used for the VIX, the equity index 
and yields.Deutsche Bundesbank

the literature.13 Uncertainty is ordered fi  rst 
in the SVAR.14 This allows us to interpret 
that uncertainty shocks generally impact 
simultaneously on all the variables that fol-
low them, but that all the other shocks only 
affect the uncertainty indicator with a time 
lag.15 The equity market indicator is ordered 
before the yields of corporate bonds. The 
rationale behind this is that equity prices in-
clude more of a forward- looking compon-
ent and can thus capture expectation ef-
fects surrounding economic developments 
that lie in the more distant future. Bund 
yields are ordered last so that all the other 
structural innovations which impact on 
Bund yields can be captured in the same 
period. Finally, the yield of Austrian govern-
ment bonds is included to measure the 
yield spread between two government 
bonds which have an identical AAA rating 
and thus have the same credit quality. Any 
difference that might arise can thus be ex-
pected to refl  ect the benchmark status of 
Bunds in addition to possible market liquid-
ity effects. The identifi  cation of the uncer-
tainty shock is highly robust to changes in 
the order.16
The uncertainty shocks estimated and iden-
tifi  ed using the procedure outlined above 
show the responses typical to a fi  ght to 
safety event discussed at the beginning of 
13 In a Cholesky decomposition, the ordering of vari-
ables has a bearing on the identifi  cation of the driving 
structural innovations. However, the ordering used 
here is of secondary importance for the uncertainty 
shock, which is ordered fi  rst, and only relates to the 
interpretation of the other shocks, which are not dis-
cussed in any further detail here.
14 The SVAR is estimated using the ordinary least 
squares (OLS) approach. As an alternative, it is also 
possible to use Bayesian techniques to estimate the 
SVAR. However, since the estimation results do not dif-
fer substantially, the results are based on the OLS esti-
mation.

this box text (see the chart on page  35). 
Taken in isolation, an unexpected increase 
in uncertainty, measured in terms of a 
10-percentage- point17 increase in the VIX, 
depresses equity prices by just over 8%. 
Prices of risk- bearing non- fi  nancial corpor-
ate bonds likewise come under pressure, 
their yields climbing by as much as 30 basis points at their peak. That is, investors lower 
their valuations of assets whose (expected) 
cash fl  ows have become more uncertain 
and “take fl  ight” from these assets. As un-
certainty recedes in the months that follow, 
equity prices recover and the yields of cor-
porate bonds decline again. During this 
fl  ight to safety, ten- year Bund yields fall ini-
tially by a little more than ten basis points. 
Yields decline even further over the course 
of the next half- year, depressing Bund yields 
by almost 25 basis points compared to the 
base level. This lagged response probably 
shows that fl  ights to safety identifi  ed at 
monthly intervals do not end abruptly. It is 
also worth noting that Bund yields decline 
more sharply than the yields of Austrian 
government bonds with identical maturities 
(see the adjacent chart). While the shape of 
the responses is quite similar, the yields of 
ten- year Austrian government bonds fall 
less sharply – with a peak decline of just 
under 20 basis points. Note also that Bund 
yields take more time to recover than their 
Austrian counterparts. The spread between 
both yields therefore widens to a little more 
than ten basis points after roughly half a 
year.18 The uncertainty shock – the driver 
behind fl  ight to safety episodes – explains 
almost 10% of the forecast error variance 
of Bund yields in the fi  rst month, compared 
to just over 6% at most in the case of Aus-
trian government bond yields (see the adja-
cent table). At the six- month horizon, the 
shock explains more than twice as much of 
the forecast error variance of Bund yields 
(just over 23%) compared to Austrian gov-
ernment bond yields (almost 11%). Over the 
long run, almost one- quarter of the fore-
cast error variance of Bund yields can be ac-
17 This corresponds to roughly one standard deviation 
of the VIX in the observation period.

counted for by the fl  ight to safety.19 The 
fact that Bunds show a stronger response 
to fl  ight to safety events than their Austrian 
counterparts ultimately refl  ects the Bund’s 
status as a benchmark security.
Flight to safety events occur whenever un-
certainty rises (exogenously). This is why 
Bund yields usually edge lower during such 
episodes. The fi  nancial crisis, in particular, 
played a major role during the observation 
period because it can ultimately be inter-
preted as a combination of uncertainty and 
fi  nancial shocks.20 After peaking at just over 
4.5% in July 2008, Bund yields declined by 
a little more than 1.5 percentage points be-
tween October 2008, when the fi  nancial 
crisis came to a head, and December of 
that year (see the above chart). Flight to 
safety events during this period contributed 
roughly -1 percentage point to the decline 
in yields. During the sovereign debt crisis, a 
number of euro area countries went 
through spells in which fl  ight to safety ef-
fects depressed Bund yields by roughly 50 
basis points. While it would be wrong to 
dismiss a decline of this magnitude out of 
hand, uncertainty shocks were not the main 
driver behind the spreads of countries with poorer credit ratings observed during the 
sovereign debt crisis.
19 In a VAR, the path followed by variables is deter-
mined by exogenous drivers (shocks), allowing for 
interdependencies between the variables. This means 
that, following a shock in one period, it is possible to 
forecast the future development of variables. The dif-
ference between realised outcomes in a given period 
and their values forecast earlier (forecast errors) can be 
attributed to new shocks. As a result, the forecast error 
variance is linked to the variance of the variables that 
arises from the impact of the various shocks in each 
period and the feedback effects embedded in the 
model.

Analysis of the taper and Bund 
tantrums
In the following, two further estimations exam -
ine the extent to which the chosen determin -
ants had a stabilising effect on Bund yields dur -
ing what are referred to as the taper tantrum 
and the Bund tantrum. To this end, the dur -
ation of both tantrums is defined in such a way 
as to fully cover the two (local) periods of rising 
interest rates. The time span from 3 May 2013 
until 11  September 2013 is set for the taper 
tantrum; the Bund tantrum is defined as lasting 
from 17 April 2015 until 10 June 2015. For the 
further estimations, a dummy variable is then 
defined for each of the two tantrums, which 
are combined with the determinants (Taper_
Tantrum, Bund_Tantrum).
For the phase of the taper tantrum, the results 
indicate a significantly lower sensitivity of Bund 
yields to their market liquidity and to equity 
market uncertainty, as well as a heightened 
sensitivity to the scarcity premiums (Estimate 2 
in the table on page 32). Thus, neither the li -
quidity premiums, which actually widened dur -
ing the tantrum, nor equity market uncertainty 
had a significant impact on yields overall during 
this phase. Apparently, market liquidity and 
events in the equity markets were insignificant 
for the increase in yields at that time, while 
scarcity premiums, which were somewhat 
lower on balance, played an above- average 
part in this respect. No changed effects are 
found for the other determinants. Interestingly, 
this also applies to the (at that time, sharply 
rising) US yields, which continued to be re -
flected strongly in Bund yields.
The significant rise in Bund yields during the 
Bund tantrum by almost one percentage point 
probably largely reflects the fact that market 
participants at the time felt the previous decline 
in yields to be excessive and corrected it very quickly. The estimation results provide informa -
tion on the respective contributions of the se -
lected determinants. They point to a tempor -
ary, considerably weaker (and ultimately, there -
fore, to an insignificant) impact of the scarcity 
premiums and, at the same time, to signifi -
cantly stronger effects stemming from the 
slope of the Eonia swap rate curve, the liquidity 
premiums and the VDAX (Estimate 3). Thus, the 
slope of the Eonia swap rate curve at the short 
end gained just under 10 basis points during 
the Bund tantrum, to which long- term Bund 
yields reacted particularly sensitively. At the 
same time, the liquidity advantage and equity 
market uncertainty decreased somewhat. This, 
coupled with the heightened sensitivity of Bund 
yields to these two variables, likewise made a 
significant contribution to the sharp rise in 
Bund yields.
Conclusion
The analysis of possible drivers of yields of ten- 
year Bunds reveals, in particular, that scarcity 
premiums were among the main determinants 
in explaining yield movements of late. These re -
sults therefore reflect the shifts in the holder 
structure of Federal securities, which show that 
the Eurosystem’s purchases under the PSPP 
considerably reduced the volume of Federal se -
curities in free float. Moreover, analysis of the 
holder structure suggests that the asset pur -
chase programme is also having an impact via 
portfolio adjustments and the exchange rate. 
In addition, the moderate decline in market li -
quidity also plays a role as a driver of yield 
movements. This is consistent with a reduced 
free float, the decrease in trade volumes and 
the growing order book illiquidity recorded for 
ten- year Bunds since the beginning of 2016.

tioning of the bond market as a whole.Dummy vari -

The realignment of the Chinese economy 
and its global implications
Over the past few decades, China has risen to become a global economic power, but this 
catching- up process has slowed significantly in recent years. An important reason for this is that 
the export- oriented growth model has reached its limits. Chinese companies used to be special -
ised in the production of labour- intensive consumer goods; the sales potential on the international 
markets is now largely exhausted. In addition, wages have risen sharply as a result of a growing 
shortage of labour, with the result that the cost advantages of Chinese exporters have dimin -
ished.
During the global financial and economic crisis and its aftermath, China pursued very expansion -
ary fiscal and monetary policies in order to counter the slowdown in economic growth. This led 
to over- investment in various sectors and to a sharp rise in debt, particularly in the public sector 
and among state- owned enterprises. This is likely to have increased the vulnerability of the Chi -
nese economy to crises.
In recent years, the Chinese government has therefore pursued moderate reforms. On the supply 
side, it is aiming to boost technological convergence in order to upgrade the country’s export 
range, and progress appears to have been made on this front. On the demand side, the author -
ities are working to put an end to unprofitable investments, particularly from state- owned com -
panies. At the same time, greater importance is being attached to private consumption. House -
hold demand has already grown fairly dynamically over the past few years and, against this 
backdrop, services have become considerably more important in macroeconomic terms.
Due to China’s extensive trade relations and the size of the country, the ongoing transformation 
of its economy is having a discernible global impact. The shift in demand from investment to con -
sumption is dampening growth in Chinese imports. In the export sector, the structural change in 
China in the field of labour- intensive production is opening up opportunities for other Asian emer -
ging market economies. By contrast, the shift to higher- end products could put exporters from 
advanced economies, including Germany in particular, under mounting competitive pressure.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
The Chinese economy has experienced a re -
markable rise since the reform and opening- up 
policy was launched 40 years ago. Once a de -
veloping country, it is now the second largest 
economy in the world.1 One of the key factors 
in China’s success has been its integration in 
the international division of labour. China has 
been the world’s leading exporter of goods for 
several years and has gained an outright dom -
inant position on the international markets for 
a whole swathe of consumer goods, in particu -
lar. The creation of an efficient capital stock 
necessary  for China’s catching- up process led 
to a massive expansion of investment in the 
country, from which the German economy, as a 
major provider of capital goods, has benefited 
greatly.
The absolute size of the Chinese economy, 
however, masks still significant untapped devel -
opment potential. For example, the average 
per capita income on the basis of purchasing 
power parities last year stood at just over one- 
quarter of the equivalent US figure. China thus 
belongs to the group of middle- income econ -
omies playing catch up with the advanced 
economies.Nevertheless, this catching-  up process has 
slowed down markedly in recent years. Be -
tween 2007 and 2016, economic growth 
slowed almost continuously from year to year.2 
Negative external factors, such as the global fi -
nancial and economic crisis and the recessions 
in some euro area countries, are likely to have 
temporarily curbed expansion. By contrast, the 
global economic environment has been rather 
favourable in recent years. Despite this, eco -
nomic growth in China has languished far 
below its previous rates, stabilising at just under 
7% per year. It is hence very likely that the 
underlying pace of growth has slowed even 
further.
In other Asian countries that experienced a 
rapid catching- up process in the past, eco -
nomic growth slowed over time (see the box 
on pages 48 and 49). That said, the slowing of 
growth in China has been comparatively sharp. 
It is evident that the “natural” moderation of 
growth that accompanies rising per capita in -
come is not the only factor at play here.
Need for economic 
 adjustment
One of the key reasons for the marked moder -
ation of growth in the Chinese economy is 
likely to lie in the limits of the export- oriented 
economic model that prevailed in China in the 
past. Very expansionary monetary and fiscal 
policies, which were pursued until recently, 
caused additional problems.Increased signifi -

Limits of export orientation
For a long time, economic growth in China was 
driven largely by external demand. China’s ac -
cession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) 
in 2001 gave Chinese exports of goods an add -
itional boost. Between 2001 and 2013, China’s 
share of global trade rose from 4% to 12%. 
However, in recent years the export engine has 
started to sputter, and the country has not 
seen any additional meaningful gains in market 
share.
One of the factors behind the flattening of ex -
port growth is that China, given its wage cost 
advantage, used to specialise in labour- intensive 
production. Chinese exporters were quick to 
move away from simple products, such as 
clothing, and increasingly towards higher- end 
goods, especially electronics. However, com -
panies usually only carried out the final stage of 
production, ie assembling the final product 
using imported parts and components. Al -
though China was able to raise the share of its 
own value added in its exports somewhat, it 
has nevertheless essentially remained stuck in its 
role as a “workshop of the world”.3
This export strategy appears to have reached 
demand- side limits in recent years. As China is 
a major economy, its export growth ultimately 
depends on the absorption capacity of the 
global market. For many of the products it ex -
ports, China has probably already largely ex -
hausted its sales potential. For example, China 
has supplied just under half of all electronics 
imports to the European Union in recent years, 
and for certain products its share of imports 
has been very much higher still. The demand-  
side limits of an export-  oriented growth strat -
egy make themselves felt more quickly for a 
major economy than for small countries (see 
also the box on pages 48 and 49).
A second barrier to further Chinese export 
growth is linked to the supply side, namely an 
increasing shortage of labour in China. For ex -
ample, the rural labour reserve, which was drawn on in the past to cover the rising de -
mand for labour, has since been largely ab -
sorbed.4 As a result, wage growth accelerated 
markedly, and well above the rate of productiv -
ity gains.5Sputtering

4 According to official statistics, there are millions of 
people still employed in agriculture in China, and it is often 
assumed that they are in “hidden” unemployment. How -
ever, a large proportion of these people are already of an 
advanced age and may be reluctant or unable to work, for 
example, as an industrial worker far away from home. 
Moreover, the official household registration system 
(hukou ) also restricts rural dwellers’ mobility by preventing 
migrants from obtaining access to social welfare benefits 
and education services in the cities. See inter alia H Li, L Li,

5 The argument that a labour surplus is a drag on wage 
growth until the surplus has been completely absorbed is 
based on the “Lewis model”. See W A Lewis (1954), Eco -

Manchester School 22(2), pp 139-191.Deutsche Bundesbank

Compared to other countries, there has been 
an additional rise in labour costs in China as a 
result of the renminbi’s pronounced tendency 
to appreciate.6 Average monthly wages in 
manufacturing rose from the equivalent of 
US$160 in 2005 to US$800 in 2017. This in -
crease in wage costs has placed a number of 
Chinese producers of export goods under con -
siderable pressure. Particularly in the textiles 
sector, many enterprises moved abroad.
The consequences of a very 
expansionary economic policy
Until recently, the Chinese government had 
pursued expansionary fiscal and monetary pol -
icies in order to counter the slowdown in eco -
nomic growth. High GDP growth rates were 
considered necessary, particularly in order to 
satisfy the population’s aspirations to secure 
and further improve their standard of living.
Fiscal policy was used heavily during the global 
financial and economic crisis. In order to cush -
ion the sharp drop in exports, the Chinese gov -
ernment initiated a massive investment pro -
gramme.7 Given the size of the programme 
and the haste with which it was implemented, 
long- term utility considerations are likely to 
have fallen by the wayside in many projects. In 
subsequent years, too, government investment 
remained exceptionally high, and it seems that 
this led to over- investment and misinvestment 
in public infrastructure.8 Government debt 
went up steeply as well.9
The onset of the global financial and economic 
crisis marked the beginning of a phase of ex -
ceptionally expansionary monetary policy in 
China. This triggered a veritable credit boom: 
between 2008 and 2015, the commercial 
banking sector’s outstanding loans measured 
as a share of nominal GDP rose from 94% to 
136%.10 A particular problem was that loans 
flowed on a preferential basis to state- owned 
enterprises (SOEs) whose liabilities were impli -
citly guaranteed by the state. The productivity of investments made by SOEs has, however, 
always  been low.11 As a result, significant over -
capacity arose in many industrial sectors dom -
inated by SOEs, such as steel production.
The expansionary monetary policy has resulted 
in low interest rates on bank deposits, prompt -
ing many households to invest some of their 
savings in property. This has contributed to a 
strong upturn in the real estate market, where 
– at least in some regions – there are likely to 
have also been price exaggerations and an ex -
cess of newly constructed housing.12
Overall, the already very strong investment ac -
tivity in China increased again significantly in 
the wake of the country’s extremely expansion -
ary monetary and fiscal policy. From 2009 to 
2014, the investment- to- GDP ratio stood at no 
less than 45%. At the same time, the product -… and currency

7 According to official data, the 27-month investment pro -

just under US$600 billion. This equated to 12½% of Chi -
nese GDP in 2008. In comparative terms, this stimulus was 
therefore the largest of any country in the world at the 
time. See C Wong (2011), The fiscal stimulus programme

9 According to calculations by the International Monetary 
Fund (IMF), general government debt in China rose from 
just under 40% of GDP in 2007 to 62% in 2016. These 
figures take into account that Chinese provinces and local 
governments often financed their infrastructure investment 
outside of regular budgets. See IMF (2017), People’s Re -
public of China – Staff Report 2017 for the Article IV Con -

ivity of capital fell significantly. According to 
our calculations, the aggregate return on cap -
ital fell from 18% in 2008 to 10% in 2015.13 
Investment income has actually fallen short of 
investment expenditure of late. Furthermore, 
the falling productivity of capital is weighing on 
the sustainability of general government debt 
and corporate debt, leading to risks for the sta -
bility of the Chinese financial system (see the 
box on pages 44 to 46).
Chinese economy  
in a difficult transformation
The challenges of realigning an export model 
based on labour- intensive consumer goods and 
the harmful side effects of the extremely ex -
pansionary macroeconomic policy led to a 
gradual adjustment of the economic policy 
stance after the political leadership change in 
2012. The Chinese government is aiming to ac -
celerate technological progress on the supply 
side, accompanied by a shift from investment 
to consumption on the demand side.
Acceleration of technological 
progress
The intensification of technological progress 
played a key role in the successful convergence 
processes of other Asian economies in the past 
(see the box on pages 48 and 49). The Chinese 
government has also adopted such a strategy 
in recent years. To this end, it has improved the 
environment for innovation, for example by es -
tablishing patent courts,14 while also fostering 
research activities among enterprises. Against 
this backdrop, aggregate expenditure on re -
search and development has increased signifi -
cantly. With a share of just over 2% of GDP , it 
is now close to the average level for OECD 
countries.
Furthermore, China has been investing heavily 
in human capital for quite some time now, 
sharply increasing the supply of highly skilled workers. One of the key measures has been the 
expansion of universities, leading to a nearly 
threefold increase in the number of university 
students between 2003 and 2013.15 The pro -Turnaround in

13 For these calculations, the capital stock depreciation 
rate is deducted from the ratio of investment income to the 
capital stock. For the approximation of investment income 
that is not directly reported, we follow the approach taken 
by He et al (2007). According to this, employee compensa -
tion and net taxes on products (weighted by the share of 
employee compensation to gross value added) are de -
ducted from nominal GDP . In order to estimate the capital 
stock, fixed investment (net of capital consumption) is cu -
mulated. Following Ma et al (2017), the annual depreci -
ation rate is set at 7%. See D He, W Zhang and J Shek

Risks to the stability of the Chinese ﬁ  nancial system
China’s national fi  nancial system was of cen-
tral importance in its strategy for economic 
ascendance. Key sectors of the economy were 
to be afforded a cheap supply of capital,1 
while market principles for the allocation of 
capital and liability for the assumed risks 
played only a secondary role.
Since the outbreak of the global fi  nancial and 
economic crisis, this strategy has been in-
creasingly at odds with preserving fi  nancial 
stability. As a result of China’s very expansion-
ary monetary policy, the level of debt, espe-
cially in the corporate sector, has risen mas-
sively compared to gross domestic product 
(GDP). For example, total credit to the non- 
fi  nancial private sector over a ten- year period 
up to 2017 increased by over 90 percentage 
points to 209% of GDP .2 In many other coun-
tries, such pronounced and protracted growth 
in credit has, in the past, led to a fi  nancial cri-
sis or a major economic slowdown.3 An early warning indicator commonly used to identify 
systemic risks in the banking sector, namely 
the extent to which the credit- to- GDP ratio 
exceeds its long- term trend, has already been 
signalling heightened risks since 2012.4
Another sign that there has been a build- up 
of fi  nancial risks as a result of deteriorating 
debt sustainability in parts of the corporate 
sector is the interest coverage ratio.5 In 2016, 
around 13% of corporate debt was originated 
by companies whose earnings were insuffi   -
cient to cover their interest expenditure. So 
far, offi   cial fi  gures do not show a signifi  cant 
rise in non- performing bank loans, which 
stood at a relatively low level of 1.7% of all 
outstanding bank loans in 2017.6 Neverthe-
less, these offi   cial fi  gures may understate the 
true extent of problems concerning borrow-
ers’ creditworthiness.7
The credit boom was made possible by the 
rapid growth in the Chinese fi  nancial system,

cial System Stability Assessment, p 7.

International Settlements (BIS) and include loans and 
debt securities from all sectors.
3 See S Chen and J S Kang (2018), Credit booms – is 
China different?, IMF Working Paper, WP/ 18/ 2.
4 The credit- to- GDP ratio expresses the relationship 
between credit to the non- fi  nancial private sector and 
nominal GDP . The credit- to- GDP gap measures the dif-
ference between the credit- to- GDP ratio and its long- 
term trend. Based on historical data, setting a thresh-
old of 10 percentage points of divergence from the 
trend minimises the possibility of false alarms, provided 
that at least two-thirds of actual crises are predicted 
correctly over a time horizon of three years. See BIS 
(2017), 87th Annual Report, p 45f.
5 The interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing a 
company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreci-
ation and amortisation (EBITDA) by its interest expend-
iture.
6 If “special- mention loans”, ie loans that are overdue 
but not yet classed as non- performing, are included, 
the share of at- risk loans in 2017 was around 5%.
7 See IMF (2017), People’s Republic of China – Finan-
cial System Stability Assessment, p 45. In 2016, the rat-
ing agency Fitch estimated the share of non- performing 
loans in the Chinese fi  nancial system to be between 
15% and 21%. See Fitch, China’s rebalancing yet to 
address credit risks, press release of 22  September

at the core of which lies the banking sector, 
whose total assets amount to just over three 
times the size of nominal GDP .8 This sector is 
dominated by four large state- owned banks, 
though the signifi  cance of small and medium- 
sized banks has increased considerably of late. 
Most of these smaller institutions are also sub-
ject to state control, usually from local gov-
ernment agencies. IMF stress tests indicate 
that there is a risk of insuffi   cient capitalisation 
for many small and medium- sized banks, 
which could exacerbate the effects of a crisis 
in the event of an unfavourable macroeco-
nomic development.9
The Chinese banking sector also played a 
major role in the dynamic growth of the 
shadow banking sector,10 with small and 
medium- sized credit institutions, in particular, 
issuing “shadow bank fi  nancing instruments” 
such as wealth management products (WMPs) 
or channelling funding to trust companies.11 
Between 2014 and 2016, around half of 
banking- sector lending to the non- fi  nancial 
private sector was made via these types of 
fi  nancing  instruments. These largely off- 
balance- sheet transactions generally required 
less capital under the existing guidelines and 
lower risk provisioning on the part of banks 
compared to conventional lending.12 This also 
made it possible to circumvent regulatory pro-
visions restricting banks from lending to cer-
tain sectors.13 Although this practice did ul-
timately boost economic growth in the short 
term, it also increased overall economic credit 
risk and made the fi  nancial system more com-
plex.
In recent years, the Chinese government has 
boosted its efforts to reduce risks to fi  nancial 
stability. In doing so, it is facing a diffi   cult bal-
ancing act. There is a certain tension between 
signifi  cantly reducing risks arising from credit 
developments and short- term macroeco-
nomic growth targets.14 Measures taken by 
authorities to lower risk in the fi  nancial system 
have recently focused on restricting shadow 
lending and limiting opportunities for regula-
tory arbitrage. Supervisory authorities now in-
creasingly monitor banks’ off- balance- sheet 
activities and have tightened regulations for 8 The Chinese banking system is currently the largest 
in the world in terms of its assets. See E Cerutti and

world between 2013 and 2016. See Financial Stability 
Board (2018), Global Shadow Banking Monitoring Re-

11 WMPs are savings instruments which in many cases 
guarantee higher returns than traditional bank de-
posits and have an investment focus on bonds, money 
market instruments and bank deposits. See T Ehlers,

to succeed, it will therefore also be necessary to have

complex fi  nancial products.15 The newly es-
tablished Financial Stability and Development 
Committee has been set up to ensure better 
collaboration between the various authorities 
responsible for regulating and supervising the 
fi  nancial system. To strengthen fi  nancial 
supervision, the National People’s Congress 
also passed a resolution in March this year to 
bring its banking and insurance watchdogs 
under one roof.
Implicit guarantees are still a major challenge 
when it comes to ensuring fi  nancial stability in 
China. For example, investors can expect to 
be compensated by banks or the government 
in the event of losses arising from a wide 
range of fi  nancial products such as debt in-
struments issued by state- owned enterprises 
and investment products issued by banks.16 
This hampers efforts to evaluate the true risk 
of fi  nancial assets and ultimately causes a mis-
allocation of capital. Enacting policies that ex-
plicitly rule out these types of guarantees 
could put an end to the distorted incentives 
that arise from them.17
A crisis in the Chinese fi  nancial system could 
have a noticeable negative impact on other 
countries as China’s importance as an inter-
national lender and borrower has risen signifi  -
cantly since the global fi  nancial crisis. The 
cross- border claims of Chinese banks stood at 
just under US$1 trillion at the end of 2017.18 
Emerging and developing countries in South- 
East Asia, Africa and Latin America in particu-
lar have borrowed heavily from Chinese banks 
in recent years and are therefore highly de-
pendent on these capital providers.19 In 2017, 
China’s foreign claims and liabilities totalled 
around US$12 trillion or 100% of its national 
GDP . Closer fi  nancial integration increases the 
risk that a shock in China will spill over to the 
international fi  nancial system.20
The German fi  nancial system would probably 
be affected mainly by indirect spillover effects 
in the event of a fi  nancial crisis in China.21 
While the direct exposures of Germany’s 
banking system and insurance companies to 
Chinese debtors has risen in recent years and 
stood at €42 billion overall at the end of 2017, these exposures account for only 1.9% and 
0.7%, respectively, of each fi  nancial sector’s 
foreign assets.22 Direct investment accounts 
for the lion’s share of Germany’s direct fi  nan-
cial exposure to China, and most recently 
amounted to around €80 billion. Resulting 
losses would initially be felt primarily in Ger-
many’s non- fi  nancial corporate sector, which 
holds over 90% of these assets.23 There would 
only be reason to fear credit risk to the Ger-
man fi  nancial system if losses arising from dir-
ect investment were to have a negative im-
pact on companies’ solvency.
15 See IMF (2017), People’s Republic of China – Finan-
cial System Stability Assessment, p 34.
16 The prevailing practice whereby banks usually fully 
compensate the losses that small investors suffer in 
capital investments such as WMPs reinforces this per-
ception.
17 Such an approach, however, harbours the risk of 
investors changing their behaviour abruptly, potentially 
triggering destabilising effects on the fi  nancial system. 
Against this backdrop, the IMF recommends a series of 
reforms to accompany the dismantling of implicit 
guarantees. See IMF (2017), People’s Republic of China 
– Financial System Stability Assessment, p 32 and p 36.

centre of Hong Kong would probably be most directly 
affected by a shock to the Chinese fi  nancial system, 
given its close fi  nancial ties.

nese equity market and fears of a potential economic 
slump in China in mid-2015 had a direct effect on 
global fi  nancial markets. See Deutsche Bundesbank, 
Financial  Stability Review, November 2015, p 18. Risks 
could also spill over to the German fi  nancial system via 
second round effects from fi  nancial hubs such as the 
United Kingdom, whose banking system has close dir-
ect and indirect fi  nancial ties with China and Germany.

portion of science and engineering students is 
particularly high in China.
As a result of these policy efforts in innovation 
and education, China has since progressed no -
ticeably in the technological catching- up pro -
cess. For example, there has been a significant 
increase in the number and the quality of Chi -
nese patent applications in the past few years.16 
Furthermore, in the case of a number of tech -
nically sophisticated products, such as smart -
phones, Chinese manufacturers have become 
increasingly important internationally. These 
successes clearly should not belie the fact that 
China still lags noticeably behind the world 
leaders in many key technologies, such as semi -
conductors.
The Chinese government is aiming to transform 
China into a global leader in technology over 
the medium term. With this in mind, it an -
nounced its “Made in China 2025” ten- year 
plan in 2015, which set out ambitious targets 
for the development of ten domestic industrial 
sectors, including information technologies, 
electric vehicles, and industrial robots. Along -
side subsidies, the instruments of the plan also 
include holdings in foreign enterprises. In a 
number of partner countries – including Ger -
many  – this has stoked concerns of state-  
orchestrated transfers of technology to China.17 
Furthermore, foreign enterprises operating in 
China fear that there will be increased pressure 
to surrender industrial expertise, in addition to 
other discriminatory measures.18
Shift of demand from 
investment  to consumption
The second major adjustment taking place in 
the Chinese economy concerns the demand 
side. For around five years – and with increased 
effort in recent times  – the Chinese govern -
ment has been trying to put an end to over-  
investment. State- owned enterprises are a 
starting point. They are being pushed to pay 
more attention to putting their funds to more productive use and limiting their debt. For indi -
vidual industrial sectors with chronic overcap -
acity, such as coal and steel, the government 
even went as far as to announce investment 
bans. However, in order to ensure a sustainable 
solution to the problem of over- investment 
among state-  owned enterprises, implicit state 
guarantees and other privileges will probably 
also need to be abolished.19 Moreover, the au -
thorities are cracking down on speculative pur -
chases in the property market. A certain degree 
of moderation in government investment in in -
frastructure can also be observed.20 Against the 
backdrop of these efforts, growth in overall 
economic investment has weakened consider -
ably in recent years.

constantly buoyant growth, increasing its im -China’s techno -

19 Reorganising the SOE sector was indeed one of the Chi -
nese government’s main economic policy objectives in re -
cent years. So far, however, increased participation of pri -
vate capital donors in SOEs (known as “mixed- ownership 
reform”), rather than harmonising competitive conditions 
between SOEs and private companies, has been at the top 
of the reform agenda.
20 Changing incentives seem to be playing a vital role in 
the rethink. In the past, the performance of local politicians 
was chiefly measured by the rate of economic growth in 
their respective jurisdictions, which greatly incentivised 
government investment. Since 2013, however, the respect -
ive debt situation has also been taken into account in the 
performance evaluation.Deutsche Bundesbank

What conclusions for China can be drawn from other Asian 
countries’ convergence processes?
China’s per capita income, measured in pur-
chasing power parities, has now reached one- 
quarter of that of the United States. In the 
coming decades, China is aiming to join the 
ranks of the advanced economies. This is a 
leap which, in past decades, only few coun-
tries have accomplished. Some Asian coun-
tries that have made the leap are Japan, Tai-
wan and South Korea.1 Japan in the late 
1950s had a similar status to that of China 
today, as did Taiwan in the mid-1970s and 
South Korea in the mid-1980s. In the course 
of their further ascent, all three countries saw 
their very rapid initial rates of economic 
growth diminish gradually,2 and the patterns 
of their growth changed.
In many respects, China’s economic conver-
gence process thus far is similar to that of 
Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. Those econ-
omies, too, followed an export- driven growth 
model in the past.3 Taiwan and South Korea 
managed to increase their exports- to- gross 
domestic product (GDP) ratio considerably 
even after having already achieved middle- 
income status. However, their shares of global 
exports were small, which meant that they did 
not hit absorption constraints. As a large 
economy, however, Japan attained an 8% 
share of global exports in the 1970s. For some 
product groups, this fi  gure was much higher 
still. Later on, its global market share only rose 
slowly. Since the mid-1980s, it has actually 
been trending downward.4 For China, an even 
larger economy whose global market share 
has recently already hit 13%, this indicates 
that exports will not be able to drive the con-
vergence process indefi  nitely.5
What this means going forward is that Chi-
nese growth will be based to an increasing 
extent on domestic demand. In the relatively 
recent past, it already grew very sharply. Up 
until recently, its key determinant was the 
boom in investment, especially in infrastruc-
ture and other construction. The investment- 
to- GDP ratio ran up to nearly 50% in the past few years. In Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, 
investment likewise rose sharply during the 
development process. However, in none of 
those countries did the aggregate investment 
ratio rise quite as sharply as in China.6 This ob-
servation strengthens the case for believing 
that China may have witnessed certain exag-
gerations (see the explanation in the main text 
beginning on page 42).
In later stages of their convergence processes, 
Japan, Taiwan and South Korea saw their in-
vestment ratio diminish, with consumption 
acquiring greater macroeconomic import-
ance. During that period, economic growth 
was increasingly being driven on the supply 
side by technological progress. Emerging 
economies can achieve this to a certain extent 
by adopting foreign technology. However, as 
they approach the technological frontier, 
home- grown innovation becomes more im-
1 The other two successful examples are Singapore 
and Hong Kong, though as city states their stories are 
not fully comparable with the Chinese case. In fact, 
there is no generally accepted defi  nition of the income 
threshold above which a country is considered an “ad-
vanced” (or “developed”) economy. Since 1989, the 
World Bank has published an annual classifi  cation of 
countries into four income categories. On this basis, 
South Korea was fi  rst classifi  ed as belonging to the 
highest category – “high- income countries” – in 1995.
2 This observation is consistent with neoclassical 
growth theory, according to which a country’s per 
capita income converges to a long- run equilibrium 
path. The further a country’s starting position is from 
the long- run equilibrium, the faster the convergence 
process will be.

portant.7 Japan, Taiwan and South Korea 
made efforts early on towards this objective, 
creating a suitable environment for innovation 
by, for instance, enhancing the protection of 
intellectual property rights and investing in 
human capital. Moreover, they gave fi  nancial 
incentives to private sector companies to en-
gage in research and development. Over time, 
these countries accomplished key inventions 
and technological breakthroughs.8
China, too, took a technology- driven path in 
the past few years. However – like the other 
countries in the region – it cannot simply build 
up innovative capacity overnight. It is there-
fore not surprising that, despite a distinct in-
crease recently, China is still lagging far be-
hind in international patent applications rela-
tive to its size.9 In 2015, the US Patent and 
Trademark Offi   ce registered only six Chinese 
patents per million inhabitants, whereas 
Japan, Taiwan and South Korea each posted 
more than 300 applications per million inhab-
itants. However, if China’s development status 
is taken into account, the recently achieved 
fi  gure is quite considerable. Should China suc-
cessfully navigate the transition from an 
investment- based to an innovation- driven 
growth model, it will likely have good pro-
spects for emulating the other Asian coun-
tries’ growth track.

portance to the economy as a whole.21 Strong 
wage growth was a key contributing factor to 
the rise in significance of consumption. In add -
ition, households markedly reduced their rates 
of saving. At just under 40%, the saving rate 
measured as a percentage of disposable in -
come was nevertheless exceptionally high even 
recently.22 The sharp increase in consumer de -
mand in recent years was accompanied by a 
considerable shift in the pattern of expenditure. 
Higher- end goods, such as cars, have gained 
substantially in importance. In this regard, the 
rising number of middle- class households plays 
a vital role. The share of spending on services 
also grew, which resulted in the Chinese ser -
vices sector experiencing a boom. Value added 
in the services sector is now almost 30% higher 
than in the production industry; up until a few 
years ago, both economic sectors were still 
more or less equally significant.23
Similar to the transition to innovation- based 
growth, China is only just taking its first steps 
on the path to a “rebalanced” overall economic 
demand structure. In order to further strengthen 
the role of private consumption, Chinese 
households would have to reduce their rates of 
saving, which – to a large extent, seemingly for 
precautionary reasons – continue to be extraor -
dinarily high. An additional expansion of the 
social safety net could also contribute to this.24International impact of 
the realignment of China’s 
growth model
China is deeply integrated into the global econ -
omy. It is not only the world’s leading exporter, 
but also the second largest importer of goods. 
The transformation of the Chinese economy 
that is now underway, with its supply- side and 
demand- side aspects, is likely to bring about 
major changes to China’s role in international 
markets. There could also be a marked impact 
on the Germany economy, which is closely 
intertwined with China via foreign trade. China 
is now the third largest sales market for Ger -
man goods, and even ranks first in terms of im -
ports.
China as a sales market
The distinct slowdown in Chinese economic 
growth in recent years was accompanied by an 
even more significant levelling- off in the coun -
try’s import activities.25 One major factor be -
hind the sharp slowdown in Chinese imports

21 On the expenditure side, consumption (including public 
consumption, which is not reported separately), has al -
ready been the largest contributor to Chinese economic 
growth in arithmetical terms every year since 2014.
22 These data are based on the financial accounts, which 
are available up to 2015.
23 In addition, the services sector proved to be a driving 
force for job creation. Between 2010 and 2016, the num -
ber of persons employed in that sector rose by more than 
70 million.
24 See IMF (2017), China’s high savings: drivers, prospects, 
and policies, IMF Country Report No 17/ 248, pp 4-16.
25 The slower rate of growth in Chinese goods imports 
also plays a key role in explaining the sluggish growth in 
global trade in recent years. See Deutsche Bundesbank, On 
the weakness of global trade, Monthly Report, March 
2016, pp 13-35. It should also be noted that, in contrast to 
developments in goods trade, Chinese imports of services 
have risen very sharply in recent years. This is due, in par -
ticular, to booming foreign travel. See Deutsche Bundes -
bank, Driving forces behind the Chinese current account, 
Monthly Report, January 2015, pp 20-22.Deutsche Bundesbank

need for foreign intermediate goods fell.26 
However, the realignment of China’s growth 
model was an additional significant factor. In 
light of various technological breakthroughs, it 
is likely that this has enabled China to success -
fully replace some of its imports with domestic 
production. The aforementioned shift of em -
phasis within Chinese domestic demand prob -
ably had an even greater impact. As investment 
has a higher import content than private con -
sumption, such a shift in demand will, in and of 
itself, lead to a reduction in imports.27
German exporters are already feeling the ef -
fects of weaker import growth in China. Aver -
age growth in export earnings (in euro terms) 
from bilateral trade declined from 19% in the 
2000s to 7% between 2011 and 2017. If the 
general price index for goods exports to non-  
euro area countries is used as a basis, there 
was an average increase of 6% in real terms 
over the past seven years, which was broadly in 
line with the growth of price- adjusted Chinese 
imports overall. This allowed Germany to keep 
its market share in China more or less stable.28
This development is noteworthy since capital 
goods rank high among Germany’s exports. In 
2010, almost 30% of Germany’s total earnings 
from goods exports to China were accounted 
for by machinery alone. In recent years, those 
exports have risen only slightly, which reflects 
the slowdown in investment growth in China. 
By contrast, however, there was robust growth 
in exports of automobiles and automotive 
parts.29 In this regard, the shift in demand in 
China was beneficial for German exporters.30 
Another category of goods that has also made 
gains in recent years is data processing units 
and electronic and optical products. This in -
cludes a number of high- end intermediate 
goods, such as semiconductors, which China 
has so far been unable to produce itself.
The ongoing transformation of the Chinese 
economy is likely dampen the growth of Chi -
nese imports even further. In particular, it is ex -
pected that the slowdown in capital goods im -ports will continue. In this regard, the lower 
capital intensity of the emergent services sector 
could have an impact alongside efforts to re -
duce inefficient investment. Due to their range 
of high- end goods, German exporters should 
greatly benefit from the prospective moderate 
growth in Chinese imports in the future , too.31

ment of the Chinese economy is, however, not German exports

26 According to one estimate, nearly half of the slowdown 
in Chinese imports in recent years was due to the loss of 
momentum in export growth. See J  S  Kang and W  Liao 
(2016), Chinese imports: what’s behind the slowdown?, 
IMF Working Paper, WP/ 16/ 106.
27 According to an evaluation of the World Input- Output 
Database (WIOD), investment in China comprised just 
under 18% of foreign value added in 2014. At around 
12%, the import content of private consumption was 
markedly lower.
28 Measured in terms of total Chinese expenditure on 
non- commodity imports, Germany’s market share in recent 
years amounted to an average of 7½%.
29 The 6½% per year average growth in exports of auto -
mobiles and automotive parts recorded over the past seven 
years is largely due to growth spikes in 2011 and 2012. It is 
likely that the subsequent subdued growth was linked to 
German manufacturers significantly expanding car produc -
tion in China. See Deutsche Bundesbank, Reasons for the 
recent slump in German goods exports to China, Monthly 
Report, November 2013, pp 47-49.
30 Other examples are food and medicines. The corres -
ponding earnings from exports to China rose sharply from 
2011 to 2017, by an average of 32% and 23% per year 
respectively.
31 Another reason is the significant reductions in import 
tariffs on automobiles and automotive parts introduced by 
China on 1 July 2018, which are likely to be especially fa -
vourable to German companies.Deutsche Bundesbank

without risk. For instance, debt has risen 
sharply, which poses a risk to the financial sys -
tem and economic growth. With regard to 
China’s global significance, an abrupt down -
turn would have international spillover effects 
– not least for the German economy, which 
shares close trade interlinkages with China (see 
box on pages 53 and 54).
China as a supplier and 
 competitor
The transformation of the Chinese economy 
will likely change the country’s role in the inter -national division of labour, too. Consumers in 
industrial countries have greatly benefited from 
China’s specialisation in labour- intensive prod -
ucts thus far. According to various studies, con -
sumer price inflation was dampened by the 
availability of cheap imports from China and 
other emerging market economies.32
The strong wage growth in China raises the 
question of whether these disinflationary ef -
fects have now petered out or even reversed 
themselves.33 There is no evidence for the lat -
ter, at least. That is partly because there are 
other countries in the region that still have very 
low wage costs – labour- intensive production 
in China was able to migrate to these coun -
tries. Accordingly, China’s share of labour-  
intensive products imported into the European 
Union (excluding intra- EU trade) has fallen con -
siderably in recent years, while Asia’s share as a 
whole has remained practically unchanged. It is 
unclear to what extent countries such as Viet -
nam and Bangladesh will continue to have suf -
ficient capacity to absorb labour- intensive in -
dustrial sectors pulling out of China in the fu -
ture.
For advanced economies, the realignment of 
Chinese industry could raise the degree of 
competition. Even in the last few years, Chi -
nese companies have increasingly been coming 
into competition with suppliers from industrial

The international spillover effects of a sharp economic 
downturn in China
The outlook for the Chinese economy re-
mains generally upbeat, with the Inter-
national Monetary Fund’s baseline scenario in 
the April 2018 World Economic Outlook pro-
jecting that GDP growth will slow just grad-
ually to 5½% in 2023. But the sharp rise in 
debt, particularly in the corporate sector, and 
opaque interlinkages in the fi  nancial system 
entail not inconsiderable risks which cannot 
be ignored (see the box on pages 44 to 46).
The international spillover effects of a poten-
tial sharp downturn in China triggered by a 
crisis in the country’s fi  nancial system have al-
ready been analysed in numerous studies. 
There are also macroeconomic model- based 
studies looking at the repercussions specifi  c-
ally for Germany and for the euro area.1 These 
tend to investigate the consequences of a 
general demand shock in China. In the past, 
in other countries where periods of excessive 
credit growth have culminated in fi  nancial cri-
ses, it has been investment activity which has 
taken a particular hit, however. Investment 
growth in the affected countries dropped by 
an average of 12 percentage points, whereas 
private consumption growth slowed by an 
average of 3 percentage points.2
The fact that investment and consumption 
react differently is important in terms of ex-
ternal knock- on effects since, in general, in-
vestment is characterised by a higher im-
port intensity than private consumption – 
and this holds true in the case of China, 
too.3 As a result, a decline in investment 
would be channelled to foreign markets to 
a greater degree than the same size drop in 
private consumption. Studies positing sim-
ply a generalised reduction in domestic de-
mand in China are therefore likely to under-
estimate spillover to other countries.
In the NiGEM global economic model,4 
which will be used for the following simula-tions, imports are infl  uenced by a country’s 
aggregate demand. It therefore makes no 
difference whether a shock affects certain 
demand components to different degrees. 
It is only by adapting the model that differ-
ences in the import content of the individ-
ual expenditure components can be fac-
tored in.5 The respective (country- specifi  c) 
import intensities were estimated on the 
basis of data from the World Input- Output 
Database (WIOD).6

For a simulation with the adjusted model, 
the analysis uses shocks to investment and 
private consumption in China correspond-
ing to the above- mentioned historical val-
ues for other countries with fi  nancial cri-
ses.7 It is assumed that, in the medium run, 
both variables return to the path originally 
laid out. In the simulation, the Chinese 
economy therefore experiences a substan-
tial slowdown in growth. In the fi  rst two 
years of the shock, real gross domestic 
product (GDP) growth contracts to an aver-
age of just 2%. This means that China’s 
economic output undershoots the baseline 
by 7% in the second year. In the same 
period, China’s import volume falls short of the baseline by as much as one- quarter. The 
relatively high sensitivity of imports to the 
downturn in investment is a key factor here: 
in a simulation using the standard version 
of NiGEM, imports decline by just one- fi  fth.
Using the adapted model, this simulation 
thus yields spillover effects which –  aver-
aged across all trading partners  – are 
around one- third higher. Germany’s real 
GDP drops markedly against the baseline, 
by 0.8% after two years, compared with 
just under 0.6% in the standard model. 
Both variants of the model show Germany 
experiencing greater output losses than 
other euro area countries. This is due, in 
particular, to the German economy’s very 
high degree of export exposure to China.8
It should be noted that even the adapted 
model could still underestimate inter-
national spillover. The simulations assume a 
practically stable Chinese currency through-
out the downturn, yet if such a situation 
were to see a signifi  cant depreciation of the 
renminbi, the repercussions for China’s 
trading partners would probably be even 
greater. Likewise, the simulation does not 
account for a global loss of confi  dence 
among economic agents, in particular in 
the fi  nancial markets, triggered by a crisis in 
China.
7 However, there are certain circumstances applying to 
the Chinese economy that make it conceivable that a 
crisis might have milder effects than those observed in 
other countries. For instance, the Chinese authorities 
could well have at their disposal more effective means 
for stimulating demand than other emerging markets.

exports to China last year amounted to 2.6%, com-
pared to an average of 1% for other euro area coun-
tries.Impact of an abrupt economic downturn

countries in third markets. A simple metric can 
be used to systematically capture the competi -
tive pressure exerted by China on the exporters 
of individual countries. China’s global market 
share of exports in 230 goods categories is cal -
culated34 and weighted by the respective cate -
gory’s share of exports of the observed indus -
trial country. In all of the industrial countries 
surveyed, the degree of competition measured 
using this method has risen continuously since 
2004. According to the indicator, competitive 
pressure on Germany from China in 2016 was 
at a similar level to other industrial countries.
Competitive pressure from China could rise 
over the coming years for the German econ -
omy in particular.35 This is due in part to the 
fact that current Chinese industrial policy is 
largely focusing on sectors in which German 
companies have a strong global market pres -
ence. In the automotive sector in particular, 
there could be considerably more friction be -
tween German and Chinese companies. So far, 
China has only reached a global market share 
of 4½% for such exports (mainly automotive 
parts). As part of the “Made in China 2025” 
action plan, however, the development of the 
electric vehicle sector is being massively pro -
moted. The domestic market is seeing strong 
growth and is already dominated by Chinese 
models.36 In the medium term, large- scale ex -ports of electric vehicles from China may also 
be expected.
Conclusion
With China’s previous growth model increas -
ingly hitting its limits, the Chinese government 
is aiming to create a new foundation for the 
country’s economic catching- up process. On 
the supply side, the transformation is being ac -
companied by improving technology in indus -
try and a growing significance of the services 
sector. On the demand side, forces are shifting 
from exports and investment to consumption. … could rise

In order to support the structural change, the 
Chinese authorities are already implementing 
important reforms in a number of areas. Part -
ner countries have been critical of certain polit -
ical measures, particularly in industrial policy, 
with some, such as the United States, also 
using them as justification for their own trade 
policy measures. Against this backdrop, further 
improving the general environment for innov -
ation as well as continuing to push the Chinese 
economy to open up to foreign investment 
– something that has been neglected in recent 
years  – would be less contentious and also probably more beneficial from a macroeco -
nomic standpoint.
For the German economy, the transformation 
in China is likely to have wide- ranging implica -
tions. If a realignment of the growth model is 
successful and China continues to catch up at a 
rapid pace, German exporters may be pre -
sented with excellent market opportunities in 
the future, too. At the same time, however, it is 
expected that competitive pressure from China 
will also rise. In the coming years, it is precisely 
German enterprises that could feel the effects.… but some 
aspects could

Trends in the financing structures 
of  German non- financial corporations 
as reflected in the corporate financial 
 statements  statistics
The funding structures of German non- financial corporations have changed discernibly since the 
turn of the millennium. From a longer- term perspective, the strong increase in intra- group liabil -
ities and the declining importance of trade credits are striking, as are the trends towards conver -
gence in terms of both higher equity ratios and lower bank debt ratios. The effects are partly the 
result of macroeconomic trends such as the internationalisation of the German economy and the 
creation of complex value chains. On balance, the German non- financial corporations sector has 
seen a considerable across- the- board improvement in its financial viability and hence its resilience 
to exogenous shocks.
Based on a microdataset from the Bundesbank’s corporate financial statements statistics, the 
results show that the trend among non- financial corporations towards strengthening their own 
funds base continued between 2010 and 2015. The marked observable differences in the past in 
the equity ratios according to sector and size category have decreased significantly. In addition, 
there was a marked reduction in bank loans and trade payables during the observation period. 
At the same time, particularly small and medium- sized enterprises as well as non- affiliated enter -
prises saw an expansion of liquidity reserves on the asset side of their balance sheets. This could 
be interpreted as losses of flexibility in short- term funding in some segments of the corporate 
sector being offset by increased holdings of cash. Intra- group financing, which has now emerged 
as the second most important source of funding for non- financial corporations, continues to 
make advances. In this context, the funds are often raised by group financing companies on the 
international financial markets in the form of syndicated loans and securities issues.Deutsche Bundesbank

Changes in the underlying 
economic and financial 
 conditions as a challenge 
for corporate financing
Since the turn of the millennium, there have 
been marked changes in the underlying eco -
nomic and financial conditions for German 
non- financial corporations. This has also left a 
lasting mark on how enterprises make deci -
sions on the nature and structure of funding. 
Besides shifts in debt financing, it has been 
chiefly the strengthening of the own funds 
base that has been striking. After the German 
corporate sector was deemed to be undercap -
italised by international standards in the late 
1990s, within a period of ten years, non-  
financial enterprises had increased their equity 
ratio by 5  percentage points on average to 
25% in 2008.1 The associated strengthening of 
financial resilience in conjunction with other 
measures was a key prerequisite for German 
enterprises emerging unharmed from the “en -
durance test” provided by the severe recession 
in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first 
quarter of 2009, without reduced output in the 
medium to long- term and protracted job 
losses.
As global demand bounced back in 2010 and 
2011, German enterprises returned relatively 
swiftly to the decent level of profitability of the 
pre- crisis period. Initially, the crisis- induced ad -
justments in the balance sheets, which focused 
mainly on safeguarding liquidity, were grad -
ually reduced. Moreover, the underlying trends 
in corporate funding from the pre- crisis years 
have persisted into the current decade. For ex -
ample, equity capital now makes up an aver -
age of 30% of non- financial corporations’ total 
assets.
Possible explanations for the ongoing strength -
ening of the equity base and the interaction 
with other funding- related developments are 
discussed below. This is based on empirical 
analyses using granular data from the Bundes -
bank’s financial statement statistics between 2000 and 2015. Balanced samples of enter -
prises for which annual accounts are available 
at the beginning and the end of each observa -
tion period are formed. This is done to ensure 
that the observed changes in the balance sheet 
items are due to economic effects and not to 
changes in the composition of the sample. 
However, in return, it has to be accepted that 
representativeness is limited to a certain extent.
In a first step, there is an examination of the 
hypothesis of whether the development in the 
current decade towards higher equity ratios 
and lower bank debt ratios can be regarded as 
part of an ongoing convergence process since 
at least the end of the 1990s. This implies the 
notion that the extent of the adjustments de -
pends on the company-  specific starting points 
in terms of the two balance sheet variables. 
Heterogeneity in the corporate sector may be 
explicitly taken into consideration through dis -
tribution analyses and microeconometric stud -
ies.
In a second step, changes in the funding struc -
ture during the period from 2010 to 2015 are 
examined in the context of the balance sheet. 
In this regard, it is worth taking a look at indi -
vidual sectors or enterprises of different size 
categories and legal forms. The disaggregated 
analysis is also linked to the fact that the eco -
nomic upturn since 2010 has been based more 
strongly on domestic forces of growth than the 
expansionary phase between 2003 and 2008. 
Most recently, for example, construction, trade 
and some services sectors experienced a com -
paratively strong economic tailwind, which 
helped make balance sheet adjustments that 
had been carried out mainly by industrial enter -
prises in the more strongly export- led upswing 
of the previous decade.

ditions. Given exceptionally low lending rates, 
the sustained trend towards reducing the share 
of liabilities to credit institutions in total assets 
can only be explained in the context of add -
itional key determinants such as the financial 
implications of the internationalisation of the 
German economy and the creation of value 
chains, especially as credit supply- driven con -
straints beyond the point when the financial 
crisis reached its peak are unlikely to have hurt 
the greater part of the German corporate sec -
tor to a major extent.2 Specifically, the evalu -
ations indicate that the increase in intra- group 
liabilities3 in the corporate balance sheets may 
be attributable not only to operational pro -
cesses but also, to a large extent, to funding 
operations in the international financial mar -
kets.
German enterprises’ 
 financing behaviour from 
a longer- term perspective
The financing behaviour of German non-  
financial corporations in terms of their balance 
sheets since the turn of the millennium is es -
sentially characterised by four trends.4
– Sustained strengthening of the equity capital 
base
– Substantial reduction in bank debt
– Declining funding opportunities from sup -
pliers
– Strong expansion of intra- group liabilities
The considerable growth rate of intra- group li -
abilities (and, in parallel with them, the corres -
ponding claims) is related to trend factors in 
the real economy, such as the creation of value 
added processes based on the division of la -
bour5 and the increasing internationalisation of 
the German economy,6 as well as the deploy -
ment of group financing companies to raise 
funds in the international financial markets.The existence of trends towards convergence 
in terms of a higher equity ratio and a lower 
bank debt ratio suggests that the corporate 
sector’s financial resilience and, hence, internal 
capital adequacy has increased across the 
board. Studies on the longer-  term adjustment 
processes, the scale of which depends on the 
company- specific starting positions, are based 
on a balanced sample of around 15,600 enter -
prises for which balance sheet data are avail -
able for 2000 and 2015. For this purpose, the 
enterprises are grouped into deciles according 
to their equity ratio or bank debt ratio in 2000.
As the chart at the top of the next page shows 
using the decile- specific medians, the increase in 
the equity ratio between 2000 and 2015 tended 
to be all the stronger, the lower the starting 
level was. Furthermore, there were striking de -
velopments at the borders of the distribution. 
Thus, the median of the enterprises in the low -
est decile increased from negative territory to 
16% in 2015. By contrast, the enterprises in the 
highest decile slimmed down their compara -
tively generous equity base somewhat in 2000.
Convergence trends were even more pro -
nounced regarding the bank debt ratio. In the 
chart at the bottom of the next page this can 
be seen, for instance, by the fact that the gap … against the

between the medians of the first and tenth 
deciles more than halved from 72 percentage 
points in 2000 to 32  percentage points in 
2015.7 The degree of downward adjustment 
also tended to be all the greater, the higher the 
debt ratio was in 2000. Moreover, the hypoth -esis of a convergence process is additionally 
supported by the fact that the fifth of enter -
prises with the lowest initial values slightly in -
creased bank liabilities as a percentage of total 
assets in the period under review.
Looking at the equity ratios in the period from 
2000 to 2015 in the deciles grouped by the 
bank debt ratio, it is possible to discern sub -
stantial increases in all group- specific medians. 
In addition, the medians for all groups except 
the decile of enterprises with the highest debt 
ratio were in the quite narrow range of an 
equity ratio between 30% and 35%, whereas 
the starting positions in 2000 had been spread 
a great deal more widely. Furthermore, the 
findings of the distribution analysis underline 
the fact that the size of the equity ratio was 
clearly negatively correlated with the share of 
bank liabilities in total assets at the time. First, 
the enterprises which counted among the 10% 
with the highest bank debt ratios in 2000 had 
considerably increased their equity ratios from 
a very depressed level by 2015, but failed to 
match the level of the other enterprises with a 
median of just over 20%. Second, the enter -
prises in this decile reduced their bank debt 
more than others.
Further indications of equity and bank debt 
converging – each in relation to total assets – 
are provided by microeconometric studies of 
convergence hypotheses, which are taken from 
empirical research into growth and develop -
ment economics (see the box on page 62).

ing patterns of German non- financial corpor -
ations once they had recovered from the severe 
recession of the final quarter of 2008 and the 
first quarter of 2009, we analyse balance sheet 
data of a balanced sample of around 39,000 
enterprises for which financial statement statis -
tics are available for 2010 and 2015.
The enterprises included in the study account 
for more than 40% of the financial statements 
used in the extrapolated data in the corporate 
financial statement statistics. With regard to 
overall turnover, which is recorded for all enter -
prises by the Federal Statistical Office, the com -
piled dataset for 2015 represents a share of 
more than 50%. Clearly underrepresented, 
above all, are small enterprises at just under 
7%, compared with large enterprises at 68%.8 
Owing to the high degree of correlation be -
tween the two corporate characteristics, this 
also applies, albeit to a lesser extent, to the 
coverage of non-affiliated enterprises (34%). 
Of the aggregated economic sectors, only con -
struction has a particularly unfavourable cover -
age at just under 24%. On the whole, however, 
for an empirical study based on microdata, the 
analysis has a relatively comprehensive data -
base.
Equity
The results of the study clearly show that the 
non- financial enterprises from the balanced 
sample further increased their stocks of equity 
capital in the period from 2010 to 2015. Ac -
cording to the median values, the equity ratio 
rose during the observation period by more 
than 5 percentage points from 24.2% to 29.4% 
of total assets (see the table on page 64). By 
contrast, based on the arithmetic mean,9 there 
was only a minor increase from 31.9% to 
32.4%. This shows that large enterprises have, 
in the past few years, been significantly more 
restrained in increasing their liabilities by raising 
new funds, while some enterprises have even 
reduced their liabilities.10A size- category- specific analysis of movements 
in equity ratios confirms this finding. In the five 
years up to 2015, small enterprises increased 
their equity capital based on the median from 
21.7% to 28.3% of total assets, ie by more 
than 6.5  percentage points. Somewhat less 
marked was the increase in liable funds in the 
case of medium- sized enterprises, where the 
ratio went up from 26.1% to 30.6% during the 
period under review. In the case of large enter -
prises, the equity ratio in the median was 
boosted by no more than 2.6  percentage 
points to 29.8%.
The results thus show that the earlier clear gap 
between the equity ratios of small and large 
enterprises in the non- financial corporations 
sector in Germany has now largely disap -
peared. The group of medium- sized enter -
prises, in fact, currently stands at the top of the 
non- financial corporations sector’s equity pyra -
mid.
Such a convergence of equity ratios cannot be 
seen in the breakdown of enterprises by legal 
form, however. The median equity capital of 
corporations saw dynamic growth, rising from 
28.0% to 34.2% of total assets. While the li -
able capital of non- corporations also grew over 
the five- year observation period, the ratio went 
up by no more than 2.1  percentage points, 
meaning that –  measured by the median  – 
non- corporations’ equity ratio in 2015, at 
17.1%, was exactly half of the figure for corpor -
ations, and that remaining disparities in the en -Study of the

their turnover. In line with the classification recommended 
by the EU, small enterprises have a turnover of below €10 
million, medium- sized enterprises have a turnover of be -
tween €10 million and below €50 million, and large enter -
prises have a turnover of €50 million and more.

to the arithmetic mean weighted by total assets, which 
takes account of the differing sizes of enterprise; at the 
same time, the ratios are in relation to total assets.
10 While the extrapolated results of the Bundesbank’s fi -
nancial statement statistics are generally presented as 
weighted arithmetic means, this particular study chiefly 
uses (unweighted) median values. These are much less 
prone to outliers and are not determined by the recognis -
able size effects in the cross- sections, which represents a 
greater robustness in statistical terms.Deutsche Bundesbank

Microeconomic fi  ndings on the convergence of 
 non-fi  nancial corporations’ equity and bank debt ratios 
in the period from 2000 to 2015
The concepts of beta and sigma convergence 
are well known from the empirical literature 
on convergence processes in growth and de-
velopment economics.1 Generally, these are 
statistical parameters indicating that, for a 
large number of observation units, the path of 
a variable over time may be interpreted as an 
adjustment process towards a standardising 
target value. The econometric verifi  cation 
manages without the specifi  cation of the tar-
get value. In the case under consideration, the 
observation units are those 15,600 enterprises 
for which balance sheet data are available for 
2000 and 2015. The presence of convergence 
is investigated here for the equity ratio and 
bank debt ratio.
Beta convergence characterises an adjustment 
that takes place all the more quickly, the 
smaller the initial value is. Given a very high 
level at the beginning, a reduction should 
occur. In the case of equity ratios, the upward 
movement is likely to dominate, whereas the 
bank debt ratios are predominantly adjusted 
downwards. Irrespective of the main direction 
of movement, the test for beta convergence is 
based on the following regression:
x2000 /2015
i =↵+βx2000
i+✏i,
where x2000 /2015
i  is the change in the bal-
ance sheet ratio of enterprise i under consid-
eration between 2000 and 2015, x2000
i is the 
balance sheet ratio of 2000, α is a constant 
and εi the error term.
Using the simple ordinary least squares 
method (OLS), β is estimated at -0.60 in the 
case of the equity ratio and at -0.63 for the 
bank debt ratio. As the standard errors of the 
coeffi   cient estimates each stand at 0.01, the 
condition for the presence of beta conver-
gence ( β<0) is fulfi  lled. Estimating the model, 
for the purpose of a robustness check, also 
using the LAD method,2 produces results of -0.48 and -0.52 respectively, which are of a 
similar magnitude.
Sigma convergence, in this context, refers to 
the narrowing of the dispersion of the equity 
ratios and bank debt ratios respectively be-
tween 2000 and 2015. Beta convergence is a 
necessary, but not suffi   cient, condition for 
sigma convergence. It is for that reason that 
this criterion is additionally investigated. 
Moreover, a distinction is to be made be-
tween an absolute narrowing of the disper-
sion as measured, for instance, by the stand-
ard deviation, and a reduction in the disper-
sion relative to the mean value, expressed, for 
example, by the coeffi   cient of variation.
In the case of the equity ratio, the standard 
deviation increased slightly from 26 percent-
age points to 28 percentage points between 
2000 and 2015. Given the fact that there was 
a sharp rise in the mean value during this 
period, the coeffi   cient of variation decreased 
substantially from 1.5 to 0.9. As a result, the 
dispersion of the own funds ratio declined in 
relative terms rather than in absolute terms. 
The opposite is true of the bank debt ratio. In 
this case, the standard deviation declined 
from 26 percentage points to 22 percentage 
points between 2000 and 2015. However, the 
sharply reduced mean value during this period 
led to an increase in the coeffi   cient of vari-
ation from 0.8 to 1.1.

2 The LAD estimate is based on the absolute devi-
ations being minimised (least absolute deviation: LAD). 
As these are amount- related deviations, the estimation 
results are typically more robust to outliers than in the 
case of minimum square deviations. With regard to the 
distribution of residuals in the regressions, this prop-
erty proves to be an advantage.Deutsche Bundesbank

terprises’ equity bases in fact became even 
larger.
Differing statutory liability rules are a key factor 
affecting persistent legal form- specific differ -
ences in the provision of enterprises with own 
funds. Whereas only the equity capital and any 
additional collateral provided can be drawn on 
in the event of a corporation’s bankruptcy, in 
the case of non- corporations, the company 
owner’s liability is unlimited and includes all 
personal assets. The equity holdings in the bal -
ance sheet therefore lose their importance as 
the sole measure of the amount of liable cap -
ital as well as for the acquisition of funds.11
The results also suggest that enterprises which 
are structured as group enterprises in an eco -
nomic and organisational sense normally have 
a lower equity base than those that are not af -
filiated with a group, although it was possible 
to derive this enterprise characteristic in the 
present study only indirectly from the existing 
balance sheet data.12 In groups, funds are often 
obtained centrally through the parent com -
pany, a holding company or a special financing 
company. In this way, the management of 
intra- group financing needs is optimised and 
the financial autonomy of groups vis-  à- vis 
banks is strengthened.13 According to the re -
sults obtained from the present study, non-  
affiliated enterprises saw relatively large in -
creases in their equity ratios in the observation 
period; in the median, they rose relatively 
sharply from a comparatively low level of 
22.7% to 30.3%. The level and dynamics of 
capitalisation at affiliated enterprises, on the 
other hand, were significantly lower, with the 
ratio only rising from 24.8% to 28.9%.
The trend towards a further increase in equity 
and a levelling of the differences in equity ratios 
can also be seen if the results are broken down 
by economic sector. In the manufacturing sec -
tor, the median values increased from 29.3% to 
33.9%; in energy and water, the figure went up 
from 28.2% to 35.8%; and there was a similar 
development in wholesale and retail trade, with a rise from 24.6% to 29.6% (with corres -
ponding increases in their mean values). Thus, 
equity ratios of just over 30% on average are 
now the norm in large segments of the non-  
financial sector.
One exception is construction, which tradition -
ally has low equity ratios. The results show that 
the liable capital situation in this sector, which 
has been strained for many years, saw a further 
marked improvement during the observation 
period, which is evidently due to the rebound 
in construction activity since 2010 and resulting 
growth in profitability. Over the five years ob -
served, the increase in equity ratios was rela -
tively clear, with the median climbing from 
14.0% to 18.4%. However, this means that 
they are still just over one- third below the com -
parable figures of the other sectors.14 The weak 
capitalisation of the construction industry is 
partly related to its operational structure, as 
most construction firms are owner- operated 
small and medium- sized enterprises with the 
legal form of non- corporations,15 and hence 
they generally hold less equity capital for liabil -
ity purposes.16 Furthermore, statistically, ad -
vance payments are usually fairly high in the … due to differ -

14 The results for the services sector buck the trend some -
what, as the median values here indicate a strong increase 
from just 21.5% to 26.1%, while the arithmetic means even 
suggest a decline from 38.2% to 36.2%, with the latter 
very clearly reflecting particular developments in the case 
of large enterprises.

16 According to the extrapolated data from the corporate

construction sector, which has the effect of 
squeezing the equity ratio.17
Bank debt
Bank debt as a percentage of total assets ran 
counter to the trend in equity ratios in the 
period under review. According to the results 
obtained here and based on median values, the 
debt ratio vis- à- vis credit institutions fell from 
9.1% in 2010 to 7.6% in 2015. In the case of 
average values, the decline given similar sizes 
was significantly lower, however, at only 
0.4  percentage point (see the table on 
page 65). The scale on which debt to credit in -
stitutions was reduced, though, is especially 
visible when the results are broken down by 
the maturity of the loans. Over the five- year 
observation period, short- term bank debt (with 
a residual maturity of up to one year), showed 
a further fall from a very low level of 1.9% to 
1.6% of total assets.18 Based on mean values, by contrast, it increased slightly to just under 
3%, however, mainly because of the financial 
operations of enterprises not affiliated with a 
group. With regard to long- term bank debt, 
the median was close to zero in both years, 
while the average values, which are strongly in -
fluenced by large enterprises, showed a further 
decline in the ratio from 5.5% to 5.1%. The vast 
majority of enterprises were thus increasingly 
allowing their long- term bank loans to expire in 
the period under review.
Despite these declining trends in bank debt, 
the present study findings also make it clear 
that bank loans still play an important role for a 
considerable number of enterprises in the non- 
financial corporate sector. Small and medium-  
sized enterprises, in particular, still rely quite 
heavily on bank loans for their funding; the 
bank debt ratios for small firms, based on the 
median, came to 13.5% in 2010 and 12.2% in 
2015. The corresponding figures for medium-  
sized enterprises were 7.5% in 2010 and 6.1% 
in 2015. Another thing that stands out is the 
fact that firms operating in wholesale and retail 
trade and firms which are not affiliated with a 
group make substantial use of bank loans, 
which is especially true of short- term loans, but 
also of long- term funding operations through 
credit institutions in some cases. Here, the con -
ditions have remained relatively stable over the 
past five years, with only minor declines of 
around 1 percentage point in each year.

17 Since gross figures are used in the statistics to ensure 
consistency of measurement, any outstanding advance 
payments against assets are reported on the liabilities side 
in the individual financial statements. This leads to an in -
crease in total assets and thus reduces the equity ratio.
18 The low median ratio values relative to the ratio for 
total liabilities to banks broken down by maturity stem 
from the fact that, for many enterprises, only either the 
short- term or the long- term value is recorded, meaning 
that the aggregate value produces a different distribution.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

on the assets side of the balance sheet. The 
scope for borrowing from suppliers, as meas -
ured by the median, was reduced quite notice -
ably in the observation period, with a fall in the 
ratio from 8.8% to 7.0%. The associated re -
striction of inter- company funding between 
enterprises mainly affects smaller enterprises, 
wholesale and retail traders (where this form of 
short-  term funding traditionally plays a major 
role) and enterprises not affiliated with a group. 
Based on the median, these areas consistently 
recorded declines of between 2 and 3 percent -
age points in this respect. Survey findings sug -
gest that the decline in trade credit might partly 
be connected with enterprises’ heightened risk 
sensitivity in the wake of the financial and eco -
nomic crisis, which may have led to a sustained 
reduction in collection periods and have signifi -
cantly curtailed enterprises’ short- term funding 
through suppliers.19
Intra- group liabilities
Finally, the present study shows that there was 
a steep rise in intra-  group liabilities during the 
reporting period. Viewed as a whole, these are 
now the second most important source of 
funding for non- financial corporations in Ger -
many after equity capital. The ratio for intra-  
group liabilities went up from an average of 
16.8% in 2010 to 19.8% in 2015,20 with the 
increase in liabilities to affiliated companies 
being particularly concentrated on large enter -
prises.21
Under German balance sheet legislation, intra- 
group liabilities include not only financial obli -
gations from intra-  group relations, but also 
trade payables in the context of group affili -
ates. The sharp growth in intra- group items 
cannot therefore be attributed solely to the in -
creasing importance of intra- group funding 
sources. Rather, the construction of global 
value chains and networks provides a further 
explanation.Increase in

19 See in this connection the surveys of Creditreform for 
European countries, most recently: Creditreform, Corpor -
ate insolvencies in Europe, 2014/ 15. According to these 
results, collection periods in Europe have declined sharply 
in recent years, although the implementation of the 
EU Late Payment Directive of 2011 is likely to also have 
played a part in some countries. Even in Germany – a coun -
try which, owing to the accompanying legal provisions for 
trade credits with comprehensive reservation of ownership 
rights, already has by far the lowest collection periods in 
Europe – collection periods have fallen since 2007.
20 In this context, it should be borne in mind that the 
funding shares of these items stem mainly from syndicated 
loans as well as short and long- term securities issuance, 
which are often obtained through special group- specific fi -
nancing companies on international credit, money and 
capital markets. These cross- border bank and capital 
market- based funding processes can only be seen in group 
balance sheets, however. In this respect, the disintermedia -
tion of German non- financial corporations is actually con -
siderably less advanced than the individual financial state -
ment data might suggest.
21 Many smaller enterprises have no intra- group liabilities, 
which means that the median values are zero in these 
cases. For this reason, the more meaningful average values 
are used here instead.Deutsche Bundesbank

Interaction between enter -
prises’ short- term debt and 
their cash holdings
All other things being equal, a reduced level of 
short- term bank and trade credits might imply 
a loss of flexibility with regard to short- term 
funding options. Enterprises are in a position, 
however, to protect themselves against the as -
sociated refinancing risks by increasing their 
cash holdings and bank deposits.22 The ex -
trapolated data from the corporate financial 
statement statistics indicate a slight tendency 
towards increased cash holdings, with cash 
holdings and bank deposits as a percentage of 
total assets amounting to just over 7% in 2016. 
Following a temporary decline in the first few 
years of the current decade, the ratio thus re -
turned to the heightened level it had reached 
in 2009 and 2010 in order to safeguard liquid -
ity as a result of the recessionary phase of the 
financial and economic crisis.In order to establish more accurately that en -
terprises which were supporting fewer of their 
funding needs through short- term debt pos -
itions had been tending to increase their cash 
holdings in the preceding years, the balanced 
sample based on the median short- term liabil -
ities to banks in 2015 or short- term trade pay -
ables is split into a lower and an upper cat -
egory (see the table above). While enterprises 
that showed larger percentages of short- term 
debt items in their balance sheets in 2015 
altered their liquidity holdings hardly at all or 
only moderately between 2010 and 2015, the

the context of categorising alternative funding strategies 
(bank- oriented versus autonomous), see, for example, 
J Hicks, The Crisis in Keynesian Economics, Oxford, 1974,

the median recorded an above- average in -
crease in their cash holdings during this period.
The link between short- term debt positions and 
cash holdings is more pronounced in the case of 
small and medium- sized enterprises as well as 
enterprises not affiliated with a group, as they 
have limited options for securing liquidity 
through other channels, such as through group 
affiliates, when needed. For example, small en -
terprises with lower short-  term bank debt 
boosted their share of cash holdings and bank 
deposits from 11% in 2010 to 16% in 2015, while 
medium- sized enterprises increased the size of 
their balance sheet holdings of these assets from 
7% to 9%. By contrast, large enterprises were 
tending in this period to further scale back their 
liquidity buffers as a share of total assets from 
what was already a lower starting percentage of 
the balance sheet. Non-  group-  affiliated enter -
prises with lower short- term bank debt ratios in 
2015 stepped up their cash holdings and bank 
deposits between 2010 and 2015 by just over 
4  percentage points to almost 20% of total 
assets. Even non-group-affiliated enterprises 
which had smaller balance sheet holdings of 
supplier liabilities showed a marked rise in their 
cash ratio during this period.
Summary and conclusions
The funding patterns of non- financial enter -
prises in Germany have changed markedly in 
recent years. The sustained improvement in 
equity ratios, for example, continued in the 
period observed here from 2010 to 2015, with 
profit retention likely to have made a substan -
tial contribution in this regard. In addition, 
there was a considerable reduction in the dif -
ferences in the extent to which enterprises are 
equipped with liable capital depending on firm 
size and economic sector. This means that the 
idea of a significant equity capital gap between 
small and large enterprises, to which many of 
the economic problems of small and medium- 
sized enterprises were regularly attributed in 
the past, is now largely outdated.On the other hand, there was a marked reduc -
tion in debt, primarily as a result of a decrease 
in liabilities to banks, although funding in the 
form of bank loans still plays an important role 
for a large number of small and medium- sized 
enterprises in Germany. The increase in cash 
holdings in the balance sheets of enterprises 
over the past few years can be explained in the 
context of a declining share of trade credit. 
Small and medium- sized enterprises as well as 
enterprises not affiliated with a group, in par -
ticular, are tending to offset the decline in 
funding buffers at banks and suppliers with 
higher liquidity provisions of their own. Despite 
the opportunity costs, this then affords them 
more security and greater flexibility in decision- 
making. The renewed growth in cash holdings 
over the past few years therefore need not ne -
cessarily be associated with a more or less in -
voluntary reaction to a lack of sufficiently lucra -
tive investment opportunities, but could also 
be interpreted as a deliberate decision to miti -
gate risk, at least in the case of enterprises 
which are keeping their short-  term debt pos -
itions at a comparatively low level.
What particularly stands out is the strong 
growth in intra- group liabilities that has come 
about as a result of the German economy’s 
greater international focus and the establish -
ment of value added processes based on the 
division of labour. This balance sheet item 
largely reflects funding through syndicated 
loans and securities issuance, which is mainly 
obtained through special intra- group financing 
companies on the international credit, money 
and capital markets. In this respect, the actual 
deleveraging taking place in Germany’s non-  
financial corporate sector would appear, if any -
thing, to be overstated when looking at enter -
prises’ individual financial statements.
All things considered, the adjustments in both 
the financing structures and in liquidity- holding 
bring considerable advantages for non- financial 
corporations’ viability in the face of exogenous 
shocks and are likely to help make the German 
corporate sector more resilient to crisis.… especially
