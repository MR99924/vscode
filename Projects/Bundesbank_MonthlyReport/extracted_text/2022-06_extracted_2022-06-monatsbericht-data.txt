Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The German economy is expected to grow 
slightly in the second quarter of 2022.1 On an 
average of April and May, enterprises were sig -
nificantly more content with their business situ -
ation than in the first quarter, according to sur -
veys by the ifo Institute. This was largely due to 
the upward forces unleashed following the ex -
tensive easing of the coronavirus containment 
measures, which bolstered previously hard-  hit 
service providers such as the hotel and restaur -
ant sector. By contrast, retail trade got off to a 
poor start in the current quarter. This was 
driven, first, by resurgent supply bottlenecks, 
particularly owing to the closure of ports in 
China.2 Second, consumers held back on their 
purchases, with high inflation weighing on 
their purchasing power and – in conjunction 
with uncertainty about the progress of the war 
in Ukraine – on their mood for spending. This is 
also reflected in the strong deterioration in 
consumer sentiment, as measured by the mar -
ket research institution GfK. In the manufactur -
ing sector, materials shortages and a sharp rise 
in costs remained a problem, and there were 
again more enterprises in the construction sec -
tor complaining of difficulties in recruiting suffi -
cient labour in May. In April, industry was able 
to recover a small part of the production losses 
suffered in March and favourable car sales data 
from the German Association of the Automo -
tive industry (VDA) in May suggest that some 
disruptions caused by the war on Ukraine have 
largely already been resolved again. Neverthe -
less, it is unlikely that industry will make a not -
able contribution to growth overall. New orders 
are down and short- term production plans are 
weak, according to the ifo Institute.Industry
Industrial output recovered somewhat in April, 
rising by +¼% on the month in seasonally ad -
justed terms following the considerable decline 
in March.3 However, output is still significantly 
lower (-2¼%) than the average of the first 
quarter. While the production of consumer 
goods declined only slightly compared with the 
previous quarter, noticeably fewer intermediate 
goods and considerably fewer capital goods 
were produced. In times of economic and geo -
political tensions, uncertainty plays a particu -
larly prominent role in the capital goods sector, 
with the mechanical engineering and automo -
tive sectors primarily affected here. According 
to VDA data – figures are already available for 
May – the number of passenger cars manufac -
tured went up sharply recently, however. In the 
case of consumer goods, the production of 
pharmaceutical products, in particular, con -
tracted. Looking at intermediate goods, pro -
duction of other non- metallic mineral products 
plummeted. Energy consumption is especially 
high in these sectors, which means that the 
strong rise in energy prices as a result of the 
war in Ukraine put a particularly heavy strain on 
production here. Overall, industrial output re -
mained significantly below the pre- pandemic 
level of the fourth quarter of 2019 (-6¼%).
Industrial new orders were down significantly 
in April 2022, falling by a seasonally adjusted 
2¾% on the month to mark the third consecu -
tive decline. The level of new orders in April German econ -

problems in April, the figure was just over 80% in May, ac -
cording to a special survey conducted by the ifo Institute.

therefore also slumped well below the average 
of the winter quarter (-5¾%) in relative terms. 
A lack of large orders was one contributing fac -
tor to the substantial decline. However, even 
after adjustment for this effect, new orders 
were clearly down on the previous quarter 
(-3%). Broken down by region, incoming orders 
from abroad dropped especially sharply (-8½%), 
while orders from non- euro area countries 
even decreased exceptionally strongly (-11¼%). 
Broken down by sector, new orders for capital 
goods were quite considerably lower (-9¼%). 
Mirroring the decline in the production of cap -
ital goods, this demonstrates the caution to in -
vest on the demand side. By contrast, new 
orders of intermediate goods tailed off only 
slightly (-1¾%). In April, somewhat more orders 
for consumer goods were actually placed than 
on an average of the first quarter (+1%). The 
automotive industry was one of the sectors 
that was particularly hard hit by a decline in 
orders but other sectors such as mechanical 
engineering and manufacturers of computer 
equipment, electronic and optical products re -
ceived slightly more orders in April than in the 
first quarter.
In April 2022, industrial sales were up notice -
ably on the month in seasonally adjusted terms 
(+2½%). Slight growth (+¼%) was recorded 
after price adjustment, too, despite the cur -
rently high inflation rate. However, nominal 
sales increased only marginally (+¼%) com -
pared with the average of the first quarter. Do -
mestic sales and revenues generated with euro 
area countries were responsible for the slight 
growth. By contrast, sales in non- euro area 
countries fell significantly. Broken down by sec -
tor, sales of intermediate and consumer goods 
rose sharply but in the case of capital goods, 
sales figures decreased to a similar extent. Par -
ticularly in the case of car manufacturers and 
their suppliers and other transport equipment, 
sales in April were well below the average of 
the first quarter. After seasonal adjustment, 
revenues in foreign trade in goods increased 
sharply overall (+4½%) in April compared with 
the previous month. Similarly high sales growth High inflation

was also recorded in comparison with the aver -
age of the first quarter but only a little re -
mained after price adjustment (+¾%). Exports 
to non- euro area countries were not quite as 
substantial in value terms as those to the euro 
area (3% and 6¾% respectively). Exports to 
China actually declined significantly, probably 
owing to measures taken to contain the pan -
demic being tightened there. Sales of only €0.8 
billion were generated in Russia at the end of 
the period under review, compared with €2.3 
billion in February. Expenditure on imports of 
goods was up considerably on the previous 
month (by around 3½% in seasonally adjusted 
terms), partly owing to high inflation. Com -
pared with the average of the first quarter, it 
rose by as much as 7¾% (+2% after price ad -
justment), with the bulk of this additional ex -
penditure spread among non- euro area coun -
tries (+9½%). In April, only €3.7 billion was 
channelled to Russia, after imports had climbed 
to a record high of €4.4 billion in March.
Construction
Construction output declined markedly in April 
2022, falling by somewhat more than 2% on 
the month in seasonally adjusted terms and by 
just over 2½% compared with the first quarter, 
which had been bolstered, amongst other 
things, by mild weather conditions. The de -
crease was especially substantial in the main 
construction sector. By contrast, the finishing 
trades even saw slight growth, although pro -
duction figures for March had been revised 
down markedly here. Overall, however, the 
order situation in the main construction sector 
can still be described as favourable. New orders 
in the first quarter – the latest for which data 
are available – declined slightly compared with 
the final quarter of 2021 but the reach of the 
order books in May remained close to its re -
cord high of February, according to ifo Institute 
surveys. The situation is similar for utilisation of 
equipment. By contrast, the supply side is likely 
to be weighing heavily on construction output 
at present. In April and May, significantly more enterprises complained about a lack of labour 
and materials shortages than on average in the 
first quarter.
Labour market
Employment growth, which had still been 
strong in the first quarter, slowed somewhat in 
April. Nevertheless, the number of persons in 
employment still rose significantly, by a season -
ally adjusted 55,000, compared with the previ -
ous month. More people are now employed 
than before the outbreak of the pandemic. It is 
becoming increasingly difficult for employers to 
find suitable staff in many economic sectors. In 
the manufacturing sector, in particular, supply 
bottlenecks and a high degree of uncertainty 
on account of the war in Ukraine are also likely 
having a dampening effect on employment de -
velopments. According to an initial estimate by 
the Federal Employment Agency, the rise in 
employment subject to social security contribu -
tions had already lost some of its momentum 
in March. By contrast, cyclical short- time work 
arrangements were frequently terminated in 
March. In particular, the elimination of 
coronavirus- related restrictions opened up 
areas of activity in many services sectors. April 
and May saw only a moderate number of new 
registrations for short- time work. The fact that 
enterprises’ willingness to recruit staff remains 
high points to further job growth in the coming 
months.
Following a previous slowdown in the positive 
development, registered unemployment barely 
fell in May. After seasonal adjustment, there 
was a decline of only 4,000 persons compared 
with April. The unemployment rate therefore 
remained at the low pre- pandemic level of 
5.0%. Aside from short- time work, active la -
bour market policy currently provides less relief 
to unemployment figures than before the pan -
demic. The IAB’s unemployment barometer fell 
significantly in May, but remained in positive 
territory, indicating a further decline in un -
employment.Construction

Prices
International energy commodity prices showed 
mixed developments in May 2022. Crude oil 
prices rose again as a result of the European oil 
embargo against Russia and an easing of pan -
demic containment measures in China, after 
the increase of March which had been trig -
gered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had been 
partly corrected in April. As this report went to 
press, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil 
stood at US$122, which was around 15% 
higher than at the beginning of May. Natural 
gas prices continued to decline in May after 
soaring to three times their value in the imme -
diate aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
However, the European natural gas price (TTF) 
rose strongly again to around €130 per mega -
watt hour at last count.
Price pressure at the upstream production 
stages, which began to emerge at the end of 
last year, intensified further as a result of the 
war. In April, import prices were up by more 
than 30% on the year, only just short of the 
historical highs seen in the 1970s. Energy and 
intermediate goods continued to be the main 
drivers. There was a similar picture at the pro -
ducer level where domestic products were al -
most 35% more expensive on the year in April. 
Increasing inflationary pressure has recently 
emerged for those non- food consumer goods 
which are particularly closely linked to the non- 
energy industrial goods captured in the con -
sumer price index.
German consumer prices as measured by the 
Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) in -
creased in May by 8.7% on the year, once again 
marking a historical high. Measured by the na -
tional consumer price index (CPI), even the high 
rates of the 1970s were exceeded.4 Compared 
with the previous month, consumer prices rose 
by a seasonally adjusted 1.1%, which is some -
what stronger again than in April. With the ex -
ception of services, all the main components 
–  including industrial goods  – contributed to 
the growing inflationary pressure. Despite the relief measures in the form of the fuel rebate 
and the €9 ticket which will be kicking in from 
June onwards, the inflation rate is likely to re -
main significantly elevated in the coming 
months on the back of strong price pressure at 
the upstream stages of production.
Public finances5
Public long- term care 
insurance  scheme
In the first quarter of 2022, the public long-  
term care insurance scheme posted a consider -
able deficit of €2 billion in its core budget.6 The 
deficit was €½ billion higher than it had been a 
year earlier despite the fall in pandemic- related 
special expenditure. This increase was primarily 
due to the latest long- term care reform, which 
came into force at the beginning of the year.7
Revenue saw a steep rise of 7%. Since the be -
ginning of 2022, the long- term care insurance 
scheme has been receiving a regular central 
government grant of €1 billion per year (€¼ 
billion in the quarter). In addition, the contribu -
tion rate for childless persons increased by 
0.1 percentage point to 3.4% at the start of the 
year. Excluding these two factors, revenue 
grew by 4%, bolstered by significantly higher 
employee contributions.

stronger than that in revenue. This large in -Renewed rise in

4 The CPI rate was 7.9% in May. Figures of this magnitude 
were last recorded in the 1950s.
5 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain an in- depth description of 
public finance developments during the preceding quarter. 
For detailed data on budgetary developments and public 
debt, see the statistical section of this report.
6 The developments outlined here and in the remainder of 
the text exclude the provident fund. Since 2015, this fund 
has been receiving transfers from the core area corres -
ponding to the receipts of 0.1 percentage point of the con -
tribution rate. Assets accumulated in this way are to be de -
pleted again in the 2030s to dampen the expected contri -
bution rate rise.

crease was due to an exceptionally sharp rise in 
spending on inpatient care (+25%), caused 
mainly by the long- term care reform. The pub -
lic long- term care insurance scheme is now 
contributing more to the costs of long-  term 
care as the length of residence in a care home 
increases.8 The remaining residents’ co-  
contribution falls to 30% after three years of 
residential care, after applying the regular long- 
term care insurance scheme rates. Additional 
outlays of €2½ billion were budgeted for this 
purpose. Overall, there are signs of a marked 
increase in additional expenditure after the first 
quarter of the year. By contrast, the decline in 
coronavirus- related special payments to long-  
term care institutions and for coronavirus tests9 
slowed the rise in expenditure. These special 
payments fell by 10% to €1½ billion.
All in all, the deficit could be higher this year 
than in 2021. Revenue is likely to grow signifi -
cantly, although the war in Ukraine is a source 
of uncertainty. On the expenditure side, the 
coronavirus- related special expenditure is 
scheduled to expire in mid- 2022; there are cur -
rently no plans to extend it. Although a special 
central government grant of just over €1 billion 
was agreed during the final deliberations on 
the central government budget for 2022, this 
does not entirely cover even the special ex -
penditure accrued to date. The new regular 
central government grant and the revenue 
generated by the increase in the contribution 
rate for childless persons (+0.1  percentage 
point) only partially offset the burdens arising 
from the long-  term care reform. As a conse -
quence, the freely available reserves may be 
run down so far that the contribution rate al -
ready has to be raised again in 2023.
Securities markets
Bond market
At €129.0 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in April was significantly down on 
the previous month’s level (€167.3 billion). After deducting redemptions and taking ac -
count of changes in issuers’ holdings of their 
own debt securities, the outstanding volume of 
domestic bonds fell by €2.1 billion on balance. 
At the same time, €16.3 billion worth of for -
eign debt instruments were also redeemed in Sharp expend -

the German market. Overall, the outstanding 
volume of debt securities in Germany therefore 
dropped by €18.4 billion in April.
In the reporting month, domestic credit institu -
tions redeemed debt securities worth €3.0 bil -
lion on balance, after having issued such secur -
ities for €22.8 billion in March. In particular, 
specialised credit institutions reduced their cap -
ital market debt (by €4.4 billion). Public Pfand -
briefe were also redeemed on a small scale 
(€0.3 billion). By contrast, there was net issu -
ance of mortgage Pfandbriefe (€1.3 billion) and 
other bank debt securities that can be struc -
tured flexibly (€0.4 billion).
In April, domestic enterprises issued debt secur -
ities worth €0.7 billion net, compared with 
€8.0 billion one month earlier. On balance, 
non- financial corporations and other financial 
intermediaries increased their capital market 
debt by €0.4 billion and €0.3 billion respect -
ively.In April, the public sector issued bonds totalling 
€0.2 billion net, compared with €12.4 billion in 
the previous month. On balance, only central 
government increased its capital market debt, 
by €2.7 billion. It issued mainly 10 and 30- year 
Federal bonds (Bunds, €6.5 billion and €6.1 bil -
lion respectively) as well as two- year Federal 
Treasury notes (Schätze, €5.6 billion). This con -
trasted with net redemptions of five- year Fed -
eral notes (Bobls) amounting to €15.9 billion. 
State and local governments redeemed debt 
securities with a net value of €2.5 billion.
On balance, the Bundesbank was the main 
buyer in the reporting month. After the sched -
uled termination of net asset purchases under 
the pandemic emergency purchase programme 
in March, it added bonds to its balance sheet 
(€13.1 billion) on balance in April, primarily as 
part of the Eurosystem’s asset purchase pro -
gramme. Domestic non- banks increased their 
bond portfolios only marginally on balance 
(€0.1 billion). By contrast, German credit insti -
tutions and foreign investors trimmed their 
bond portfolios in net terms, by €16.9 billion 
and €14.7 billion respectively.
Equity market
In April, domestic enterprises raised barely any 
new funds in the German equity market on bal -
ance (€0.2 billion, following €0.4 billion in 
March). The outstanding volume of foreign 
equities in the German market also rose to a 
lesser extent than in the previous month (€3.1

Mutual funds
Domestic mutual funds recorded inflows of 
€9.3 billion in the reporting month, compared 
with €6.5 billion in March. On balance, special -
ised funds reserved for institutional investors 
were the chief recipients of the fresh funds 
(€6.9 billion). Among the various asset classes, 
mixed securities- based funds, in particular, 
placed new shares (€4.6 billion). Inflows were 
also recorded by equity funds (€2.8 billion) and 
open- end real estate funds (€1.9 billion). The 
outstanding volume of foreign mutual fund 
shares distributed in the German market rose 
by €2.2 billion in April, after having declined in 
March (€1.2 billion). Domestic non- banks 
proved to be the main buyers (€10.9 billion). 
Foreign investors and German credit institu -
tions acquired mutual fund shares on just a 
small scale on balance (€0.5 billion and €0.2 
billion respectively).
Balance of payments
In April 2022, Germany’s current account re -
corded a surplus of €7.4 billion, down €11.3 
billion on the previous month’s level. This was 
chiefly due to a decrease in the goods account 
surplus, but was also attributable to a some -
what lower surplus in invisible current transac -
tions, which comprise services as well as pri -
mary and secondary income.
In April, the surplus in the goods account fell 
by €10.8 billion on the month to €2.0 billion 
because receipts recorded a sharper decline 
than expenditure.
The surplus in invisible current transactions de -
clined by €0.5 billion to €5.4 billion in April 
2022. Net receipts in primary income fell by 
€2.7 billion to €10.7 billion, largely on account 
of higher dividend payments to non- residents 
from portfolio investment. By contrast, the def -
icit in the services account narrowed by €1.9 
billion to €0.7 billion. Expenditure decreased

iture on transport services and other business 
services making a major contribution to this de -
velopment. On top of this, the deficit in sec -
ondary income contracted slightly by €0.3 bil -
lion to €4.6 billion.
In April 2022, financial markets continued to be 
influenced by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and 
rising inflation rates. Germany’s cross-  border 
portfolio investment generated net capital ex -
ports of €7.4 billion (March: €16.9 billion). 
Non- resident investors disposed of German 
securities to the tune of €17.9 billion net, sell -
ing bonds (€7.5 billion) –  especially those is -
sued by the public sector – and money market 
paper (€7.1 billion). They also offloaded shares 
issued in Germany (€3.7 billion), while adding 
mutual fund shares worth €0.5 billion net to 
their portfolios. Domestic investors parted with 
foreign securities worth €10.5 billion net, dis -
posing of foreign bonds to the tune of €16.8 
billion. By contrast, they acquired foreign shares 
(€3.6 billion), mutual fund shares (€2.2 billion) 
and money market paper (€0.5 billion).
In April, transactions in financial derivatives re -
corded net outflows (€3.8 billion).
Direct investment generated net capital exports 
of €13.6 billion in the reporting month (March: 
net capital imports of €3.8 billion). Domestic 
enterprises injected their affiliates abroad with 
direct investment funds totalling €30.1 billion, boosting equity capital by €9.5 billion and 
granting additional loans amounting to €20.5 
billion on balance. These funds were provided 
almost exclusively as financial loans. Con -
versely, non- resident enterprises stepped up 
their direct investment in Germany by €16.5 
billion, raising their equity capital by €1.1 bil -
lion. In addition, they granted €15.3 billion in 
loans to affiliated enterprises in Germany.
Other statistically recorded investment – which 
comprises loans and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank de -
posits and other investments – registered net 
capital imports amounting to €27.1 billion in 
April (following net capital exports of €2.5 bil -
lion in March). While cross- border transactions 
balanced out for enterprises and households, 
all other economic sectors recorded net capital 
imports. For example, the Bundesbank’s net 
claims declined by €16.2 billion, with its 
TARGET2 claims decreasing by €34.6 billion. At 
the same time, the Bundesbank’s external li -
abilities also fell significantly, as non- euro area 
residents reduced their deposits with the Bun -
desbank. Monetary financial institutions (ex -
cluding the Bundesbank) recorded net capital 
imports of €9.1 billion and general government 
also registered a rise in its net external liabilities 
in other investment (€1.7 billion).

Outlook for the German economy 
for 2022 to 2024
The German economy is withstanding the headwinds of Russia’s war against Ukraine, high infla -
tion and supply bottlenecks. Even so, owing to these factors, its recovery is considerably more 
muted than was assumed in the December projection. In the baseline scenario of the projection, 
it is assumed, that the conflict with Russia will not intensify any further. In an adverse risk scen -
ario including a cessation of Russian energy supplies, by contrast, economic activity would experi -
ence a pronounced decline.
The German economy is caught between opposing forces. As the pandemic containment meas -
ures have largely been rolled back, service providers and private consumption are receiving a 
strong boost. On the other hand, the steep rise in energy prices resulting from the war in Ukraine 
is driving up the already high inflation rate, eroding households’ purchasing power. Increased sup -
ply bottlenecks are throttling production and exports are also suffering from weaker demand. 
Upward forces gain more of an upper hand from the second half of 2022. Energy commodity 
prices decrease somewhat, supply bottlenecks gradually ease, foreign demand increases again 
and private consumption is buoyed by the depletion of some of the savings accumulated during 
the coronavirus pandemic. Additional government defence spending provides consistent stimulus.
Under these conditions, the German economy is projected to grow by around 2% in 2022, by 
approximately 2½% in 2023 and by just under 2% in 2024, the year in which it will thus reach its 
potential output. The labour market will remain on an upward trajectory, with wages rising 
sharply, but the high level of inflation only being partially offset initially.
At around 7% in the current year, inflation as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer 
Prices (HICP) will even be somewhat higher still than at the start of the 1980s. This is mainly due 
to the rapid rise in the prices of energy and food commodities. However, the core rate (excluding 
energy and food) could also come in well above average, at around 3½%. Alongside sharply 
higher commodity prices, supply bottlenecks are the main factor driving prices. These effects are 
expected to diminish over the projection horizon. At the same time, though, pressure from labour 
costs will remain high, and the transition to a climate- neutral economy will generate further 
costs. On balance, inflation will decline markedly. However, headline and core inflation rates are 
likely to remain elevated at around 2½% even into 2024. Compared with the December 2021 out -
look, the inflation rate has been revised upwards for all of the years under review.
General government deficit and debt ratios will decline distinctly over the projection horizon, 
largely because coronavirus- related fiscal burdens will expire. These will outweigh deficit- increasing 
fiscal policy measures related to the high energy costs, the war in Ukraine and climate change.
The risks to economic activity are tilted to the downside, chiefly due to the uncertainties surround -
ing the war in Ukraine. With regard to inflation, the upside risks predominate. These risks already 
partly materialised after the projection was finalised. On account of the surprisingly high inflation 
momentum in May, the annual average HICP rate for 2022 could amount to 7¾%, as things cur -
rently stand.Deutsche Bundesbank

Economic outlook1
The German economy contracted marginally in 
the last quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 
2022, proving itself to be more robust than an -
ticipated in the December projection2 – all the 
more so considering the additional strains 
posed by the surprisingly high level of inflation 
and the Russian war of aggression against 
Ukraine. The exact repercussions of the Omi -
cron wave of the coronavirus were still barely 
predictable, especially as little was known 
about its characteristics when the projection 
was finalised at the start of December.3 Overall, 
the pandemic is likely to have had somewhat 
less of a dampening effect on economic activ -
ity than assumed at the time. Industry, which 
managed to expand production considerably 
before the outbreak of the war, also fared sur -
prisingly well, benefiting from an initial easing 
of restrictions imposed by supply bottlenecks 
for intermediate products. Construction, too, 
saw stronger growth than expected, receiving 
a large boost in the winter months on account 
of the mild weather.
At present, the German economy is caught be -
tween opposing forces. The large- scale rollback 
of pandemic containment measures is unleash -
ing strong upward forces that are benefiting 
the previously beleaguered service providers in particular and thus giving related consumer 
spending a strong boost. This is being counter -
acted by multiple headwinds: the sharply 
higher energy prices resulting from the war in 
Ukraine are fuelling the already high level of in -
flation and weighing on both output at energy- 
intensive enterprises and households’ purchas -
ing power. The supply bottlenecks have already 
flared up again due to the impact of the war 
and arguably also because of how the pan -
demic is playing out in China. This is likely to 
have ripple effects on exports, amongst other 
things, which are facing the additional burdens 
of the sanctions imposed on Russia and weaker 
foreign demand. Lastly, there is no telling how 
the conflict will unfold and what impact it will 
have in future on consumers’ lives and the eco -
nomic environment. This uncertainty is weigh -
ing on the propensity to consume and invest. 
Additional government measures are buoying 
demand, meanwhile.
All in all, the upward forces are likely to pre -
dominate slightly in the second quarter, and 
economic output could rise a little. This is indi -
cated by the ifo Institute’s latest survey results, 
which show that enterprises overall were dis -
tinctly more satisfied with their current business 
on average in April and May than they had 
been in the first quarter. The Bundesbank’s 
weekly activity index (WAI), which includes 
high- frequency indicators such as the toll index 
and credit card payments available up to at 
least the end of May, points in the same direc -German econ -

Deutsche Bundesbank1 This projection for Germany was finalised on 24  May 
2022. It was incorporated into the projections for the euro 
area published by the ECB on 9 June 2022. As the new na -
tional accounts figures for the first quarter of 2022 were 
not published until 25 May 2022, the projections are based 
on the national accounts data of 25 February 2022. The 
gross domestic product (GDP) flash estimate of 29 April 
2022 for the first quarter of 2022 is included, however.
2 The December 2021 projection had expected a some -
what clearer decline in real GDP . As the previous quarters 
of 2021 had been revised upwards as well, the observed 
lag in economic activity compared with the pre- pandemic 
level from the fourth quarter of 2019 was reduced to only 
0.9% in the first quarter of 2022, while the December pro -
jection had assumed a level of 1.5%; see Deutsche Bundes -
bank (2021a).
3 At that time, it was therefore assumed that the Omicron 
variant would not have any material economic conse -
quences beyond those already estimated for the pandemic.Deutsche Bundesbank

tion.4 By contrast, enterprises were still very 
gloomy about their expectations in May, which 
suggests that economic activity could come in 
significantly weaker. The discrepancy between 
firms’ assessment of their expectations and the 
current situation does, however, reflect con -
cerns about the impact of the war in Ukraine 
which have not fully materialised, at least not 
yet. As the baseline scenario of this projection 
builds on the assumption that the conflict does 
not intensify any further, the forward-  looking 
indicators have only a limited effect. An alter -
native scenario assuming a significant exacer -
bation of the conflict with Russia – including a 
complete stoppage of Russian energy sup -
plies – is described in the box on pp. 35ff.
From the second half of the year onwards, the 
upward forces under the assumptions made for 
this projection are likely to gain more of an 
upper hand again. The economy should there -
fore expand more robustly over the remainder 
of the projection horizon. Energy commodity 
prices, for example, will decline somewhat over 
the projection horizon, and the high inflation 
rate will decrease little by little. The headwinds 
caused by supply bottlenecks will gradually di -
minish as well. This will give a boost to exports, 
especially as foreign demand is once again on 
an expansionary path. It will also provide tail -
winds for business investment, which – like pri -
vate consumption  – will benefit additionally 
from the decreasing uncertainty. At the same 
time, households are likely to spend at least 
some of the savings they involuntarily accumu -
lated during the pandemic for additional con -
sumption purposes.5 Additional defence spend -
ing will provide stimulus over the entire projec -
tion horizon.
Under these conditions, the German economy 
is projected to grow by 1.9% this year, 2.4% 
next year and 1.8% the year after. This means 
that the economic recovery will continue des -
pite the considerable headwinds, albeit consid -
erably more weakly than expected in the De -
cember 2021 projection. Real GDP will only ex -
ceed the pre- pandemic level from the final quarter of 2019 at the end of the current year, 
which is six months later than previously ex -
pected. Over the remainder of the projection 
horizon, too, the anticipated level of activity 
will be significantly lower than expected in the 
December projection. This downward revision 
is mainly due to the effects of the war on 
Ukraine, the already higher than expected rate 
of inflation and the more severe supply bottle -… before

necks, which arguably also relate to the re -
newed flare- up of the pandemic in China.
The economy is likely to catch up with its po -
tential output towards the end of next year. 
Accordingly, macroeconomic capacity utilisa -
tion will only return to more or less average 
levels in 2024. The growth rate of potential 
output is estimated at 0.9% for the current 
year, 1.0% for 2023 and 1.1% for 2024. These 
rates have thus been revised downwards for 
the period up to 2023. However, there is cur -
rently heightened uncertainty as to the extent 
to which the changed geopolitical and global 
economic conditions will also damage the per -
formance of the German economy over the 
longer term as well.
Until February, exports were performing far 
better than expected in the December projec -
tion, especially as supply bottlenecks were eas -
ing more quickly. However, the outbreak of the 
war in Ukraine brought that development to an 
abrupt halt. Foreign demand weakened and 
exports to Russia plummeted in the wake of 
sanctions. In addition, the supply bottlenecks 
flared up again. According to business surveys, 
they will arguably dampen output more 
strongly in the second quarter.6 This will pre -
sumably have ripple effects on exports, pushing 
them markedly below their winter level. From 
the second half of the year, though, enterprises 
are expecting the burdens caused by the supply 
bottlenecks to ease gradually.7 Moreover, de -
mand in German exporters’ sales markets will 
begin to pick up again. This means that ex -
ports, too, will be back on an expansionary 
path – only tentatively at first, but then quite Economy likely

7 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2022b). The assumption here 
is that the resultant dampening effects on production and

firms, participants expected on average that production 
would still be depressed by supply bottlenecks in 2024. 
However, they also anticipated catch- up effects from previ -

Underlying conditions for macroeconomic projections
This projection is based on assumptions 
made by Eurosystem experts about the 
global economy, exchange rates, commod-
ity prices and interest rates. These were 
made on the basis of information available 
as at 17  May 2022. The assumptions re-
garding economic activity in the euro area 
are derived from projections from the na-
tional central banks of the euro area coun-
tries.1 These projections incorporate those 
fi  scal policy measures that have been either 
adopted or adequately specifi  ed and are 
deemed likely to be implemented.
With regard to the war in Ukraine and its 
ramifi  cations, it is assumed that the confl  ict 
will not escalate further, but that existing 
sanctions will remain in force over the pro-
jection horizon.2 Moreover, it is assumed 
that bottlenecks in the supply of intermedi-
ate inputs, caused in part by coronavirus 
containment measures and weighing on in-
dustry and world trade, will largely be re-
solved by the end of next year.
Global economic recovery dampened 
signifi  cantly by the ramifi  cations of the 
war in Ukraine, amid high global price 
pressures
In the fourth quarter of last year, global 
economic growth was initially higher than 
expected in the December projection. By 
contrast, it was signifi  cantly weaker in the 
fi  rst quarter of this year. First, economic ac-
tivity was throttled by the Russian war of 
aggression against Ukraine that was 
launched at the end of February, which 
pushed up numerous commodity prices and 
raised uncertainty. There was a lack of inter-
mediate inputs due to production stop-
pages in Ukraine, and there were signs of 
shortages of some industrial raw materials 
produced there and in Russia. Owing to the sanctions that have been imposed, a sharp 
slump in Russian economic output is ex-
pected for the current year, and the war in 
Ukraine is likely to considerably weaken the 
Russian economy in the period thereafter, 
too.3 Against this backdrop, the outlook for 
countries in geographical proximity to or 
that are highly dependent on energy im-
ports from Russia also deteriorated signifi  -
cantly. Second, the spread of the Omicron 
variant of the coronavirus had a dampening 
effect. In China, strict containment meas-
ures were imposed starting in March. Busi-
ness closures and the resulting logistical 
problems are likely to have a negative im-
pact on global economic activity, especially 
in the current quarter.
In many countries around the world, the 
sharply rising prices of energy and other 
commodities as well as food are weighing 
on consumers and enterprises alike. While 
price pressures are expected to ease again 
over the projection horizon, the turmoil 
will, overall, contribute to a signifi  cant 
dampening of global economic activity 
both this year and next year compared with 
the December projection. The global econ-
omy excluding the euro area looks set to 
expand by 3½% in 2023 and 2024, respect-
ively, following growth of 3% in 2022. At 
4¼% this year, the uptick in international 
trade (excluding the euro area) will be 
slightly higher than the rise in global gross 
domestic product (GDP) and what had been

oil futures prices already refl  ect certain expectations re-
garding import restrictions for Russian oil in the Euro-
pean Union, which recently reached an agreement to 
ban Russian oil imports by sea.

projected in the December outlook. How-
ever, this can be attributed to growth in the 
second half of last year. Expanding by 3% 
and 3¾% in 2023 and 2024, respectively, 
growth will subsequently lag behind De-
cember expectations.
War in Ukraine weighing heavily on the 
euro area recovery, high infl  ation rates 
eroding purchasing power
As expected, the economic recovery in the 
euro area slowed signifi  cantly in the last 
quarter of 2021 and the fi  rst quarter of 
2022. The main factors straining the recov-
ery were measures aimed at limiting the 
rapid spread of COVID- 19, bottlenecks in 
the supply of intermediate inputs in the 
manufacturing sector and sharply rising en-
ergy and food prices. Uncertainty also in-
creased in the context of the Ukraine war, 
which is likely to continue to cause enter-
prises and households to plan their spend-
ing cautiously. Given this overall situation, economic growth in the second and third 
quarters of 2022 is expected to be signifi  -
cantly weaker than assumed in the Decem-
ber projection. Macroeconomic momentum 
is likely to pick up again only as uncertainty 
decreases, supply bottlenecks are resolved 
and infl  ation rates go down. With growth 
rates of 3.2% in 2022 and 1.9% in 2023, 
economic growth in the euro area (exclud-
ing Germany) is expected to be signifi  cantly 
lower this year and next year than assumed 
in the December outlook. At 2.2%, the rate 
projected for 2024 is then slightly higher.
German exporters’ sales markets are likely 
to see slower growth than world trade this 
year and next year. This is due, fi  rst, to the 
fairly major importance – relatively speak-
ing – of the Russian and Ukrainian markets. 
Second, the EU economies that have close 
ties with Germany, in particular the eastern 
European EU Member States, are also being 
more adversely affected by the war in 
Ukraine.
Technical assumptions of the projection
Concerns surrounding supply tensions in 
the global oil market, coupled with robust 
demand, had caused crude oil prices to rise 
further as early as January and February. In 
January, gas prices initially decreased slightly 
from the peaks reached in December 2021 
owing to mild weather conditions and in-
creased imports of liquid gas from the 
United States. Following the start of the 
war in Ukraine, the prices of fossil fuels, 
some industrial metals and food commod-
ities, such as wheat and corn, then soared. 
Russia and Ukraine are major exporters of 
these goods, meaning that fears of poten-
tial supply disruptions pushed prices to re-
cord highs. In the meantime, the prices of 
fossil fuels have dropped back down con-
siderably. The assumptions derived from 
futures  prices indicate that prices of energy 
and other commodities will fall over the Major assumptions of the projection

projection horizon. Nevertheless, they will 
remain signifi  cantly higher than the prices 
projected in December. Following their 
huge increase this year, agricultural produ-
cer prices in the euro area will continue to 
climb somewhat on average next year, be-
fore declining again in 2024.
The Eurosystem discontinued its net asset 
purchases under the pandemic emergency 
purchase programme (PEPP) at the end of 
March. In the same month, the ECB Gov-
erning Council also decided to scale back 
net asset purchases under the asset pur-
chase programme (APP) at a faster pace 
than initially envisaged until they are dis-
continued in the third quarter of 2022. In 
addition, given that infl  ation rates are ex-
pected to remain high, the Governing 
Council will make any adjustments to the 
key ECB interest rates some time after the 
end of net purchases under the APP . In the 
money market, interest rates have risen in 
recent months, and EURIBOR futures are on 
a far steeper upward trajectory over the 
projection horizon than had been assumed 
in the December outlook. Against the back-
drop of the higher short- term interest rates 
expected by market participants, yields on 
ten- year Federal bonds (Bunds) also went 
up signifi  cantly compared with December. 
In addition, the yield trajectory derived from 
futures prices will continue to increase over 
the projection horizon – similar to what 
was assumed in the December outlook but 
at a higher level. Higher fi  nancing costs are 
also expected for bank loans.
Expectations of an accelerated process of 
monetary policy normalisation in the United 
States and the anticipated economic conse-
quences of the war in Ukraine for the euro 
area have caused the euro to depreciate 
since the start of the year. In the period 
underlying the exchange rate assumptions, 
the euro was trading at US$1.05, 7% lower 
than assumed in the December projection. Compared with 42 currencies of major trad-
ing partners, the euro depreciated by 2%.
Fiscal policy responds to high energy 
prices and the war in Ukraine
On balance, fi  scal policy measures will ease 
the burden on government fi  nances over 
the projection horizon. On the one hand, 
government assistance measures adopted 
over the course of the pandemic and in 
view of high energy costs will gradually di-
minish in signifi  cance. On the other, spend-
ing on defence and climate change mitiga-
tion, in particular, will increase. It is also as-
sumed that the bracket creep in income tax 
will continue to be offset in the coming 
years. The Federal Government has an-
nounced as much.
Expiring coronavirus measures will ease the 
pressure on the government budget this 
year. They will amount to only 1¼% of GDP , 
compared with 3¾% in 2021. This is be-
cause support measures for enterprises and 
households will be of only minor signifi  -
cance this year. By contrast, coronavirus- 
related healthcare expenditure will remain 
high. This mainly relates to spending on 
testing and vaccinations as well as compen-Oil price

sation payments to hospitals. In 2023, this 
expenditure will have largely tapered off.
By contrast, new measures will put pressure 
on the general government budget. The aid 
provided to cushion the impact of higher 
energy costs will be refl  ected primarily in 
this year’s budget, after which it will feature 
only minimally. The main forms of support 
that households will receive are a one- off 
energy price allowance, a bonus child bene-
fi  t payment and means- tested one- off pay-
ments. Enterprises that are particularly af-
fected by the high energy costs can, 
amongst other things, apply for fi  nancial 
support. In addition, fuel taxes and ticket 
prices for local public transport have been 
cut for three months. The renewable en-
ergy levy on the price of electricity will be 
abolished around the middle of the year. 
However, due to electricity prices remaining 
high and a sizeable amount of levy funds 
being available, this will not adversely affect the general government budget over the 
projection horizon.
The projection also includes signifi  cant hikes 
in expenditure in various areas. It is as-
sumed that there will increasingly be out-
fl  ows from the Armed Forces Special Fund – 
chiefl  y for the purchase of weapons. As a 
result, investment in machinery and equip-
ment, in particular, is set to see strong 
growth over the projection horizon. In add-
ition, expenditure on refugees as well as re-
construction assistance in Ukraine is envis-
aged. Spending on climate change mitiga-
tion will also rise signifi  cantly. Finally, pen-
sion expenditure will climb markedly over 
the projection horizon – despite various 
measures to curb spending.4
On the revenue side, accelerated write- offs 
of capital equipment and adjustments to 
the income tax scale will lower wage and 
income tax. In order to compensate for 
bracket creep, the income tax brackets (in-
cluding the basic income tax allowance) will 
be shifted in 2023 and 2024 by the pro-
jected infl  ation rate of the respective previ-
ous year. In addition, revenue from the EU 
programme NextGenerationEU (NGEU) will 
decrease over the projection horizon.5 By 
contrast, rising contribution rates for the 
social security funds will boost revenue: 
they will be raised by just over 1 percentage 
point in 2023 and 2024 combined. Health 
insurance scheme rates will increase, in par-
ticular. This will close the structural fi  nan-
cing gap that was largely fi  lled by central 
government recently. A small amount of 
additional revenue will come from trading 
CO₂ certifi  cates and from this year’s to-
bacco tax hike.

ing programmes, thus reducing the general govern-

robustly as from the fourth quarter – on the 
back of the increasing normalisation of primary 
product procurement. These catch- up effects 
will expire in 2024, causing exports to lose mo -
mentum again. Over the projection horizon as 
a whole, German enterprises will have to toler -
ate certain losses in market share. Particularly in 
trade with its euro area partner countries, Ger -
many will see its price competitiveness decline 
to some extent because its labour costs and 
prices will increase more steeply by compari -
son.
Business investment, too, was trending up -
wards until the outbreak of the war in Ukraine. 
In the first quarter, the previously upbeat out -
put expectations and diminishing supply bottle -
necks probably still outweighed the gloomier 
outlook at the start of the war and the associ -
ated uncertainty. However, there is likely to be 
a marked setback in the second quarter. This is 
indicated by forward- looking indicators such as 
the business climate of capital goods manufac -
turers, which deteriorated considerably in April 
and May, or the distinct decline in domestic 
orders they registered in March. Over the fur -
ther course of the projection horizon, firms’ 
propensity to invest should pick up again sig -
nificantly as uncertainty recedes, supply bottle -
necks gradually unwind, foreign demand rises 
and capacity utilisation increases. Moreover, in -
vestment projects related to the transition to a 
climate- neutral economy could bolster com -
mercial investment. The less favourable finan -
cing conditions will be a source of headwinds 
throughout, however. All in all, the recovery in 
business investment will be noticeably delayed, 
with expected investment volumes constantly 
lagging behind the level anticipated in the De -
cember projection.
Private consumption declined markedly in the 
last quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 
2022 on account of pandemic- related burdens 
and high inflation. Although inflation came in 
considerably higher than had been anticipated 
in the December projection and did more to 
dampen households’ purchasing power, the decline was roughly in line with the projection.8 
With the containment measures now largely 
lifted, private consumption should receive a 
strong boost from the second quarter on -
wards.9 Consumption opportunities are now 
largely available without restrictions and are 
evidently also being utilised. This is indicated 
by, for example, the sharp rise in real sales in 
the hospitality industry in March and the fur -
ther considerable improvement in the business 
situation in this sector in April and May. At the 
same time, however, the persistent high infla -
tion represents a strong headwind. Not only is 
it reducing households’ purchasing power. It is 
also weighing on their consumption sentiment, 
which is also being hurt by the uncertainties 
about how the war in Ukraine will play out.10 
Overall, however, the upward forces are likely 
to predominate and private consumption is

8 The repercussions of the pandemic were arguably some -
what less severe than previously feared.
9 Private consumption also recovered strongly over the 
past two years as the number of infections declined. As 
households’ real disposable income has remained broadly 
stable during the pandemic so far – partly owing to gov -
ernment support – the saving ratio rose sharply during the 
previous waves of infection. Survey results indicate that in -
voluntary savings were built up chiefly for pandemic-  
related reasons, i.e. the fear of infection and, in particular, 
the lack of opportunities for consumption. See Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2020, 2021b).

extent than expected in the December projec -
tion.
Growth in private consumption is expected to 
continue thereafter, though only at a moderate 
pace. Real disposable income will keep declin -
ing initially owing to the high inflation, only ris -
ing again gradually as inflation eases. Private 
consumption will be given a boost, by contrast, 
in the coming quarters from the further decline 
in the saving ratio. New survey results from the 
Bundesbank’s Online Panel Households (BOP-  
HH) indicate that households still want to use 
part of the money they were forced to save 
during the pandemic for additional consump -
tion expenditure (see the box on pp.  23 f.). 
However, the results also show that they will 
arguably treat these savings with greater cau -
tion. The resulting stimulus for private con -
sumption is therefore significantly smaller than 
assumed in previous projections. In a reflection 
of this, the saving ratio will not drop as far 
below its pre- pandemic level, bottoming out in the middle of coming year before rising again.11 
This will counteract rising real income, leaving 
private consumption virtually unchanged at the 
end of the projection horizon.
Housing construction investment exceeded the 
expectations of the December projection mark -
edly. In addition to the easing of materials 
shortages until February, it received a strong 
boost from the mild weather in the winter 
months. A return to the usual seasonal wea -
ther conditions in the second quarter is likely to 
cause a setback. Stiff headwinds also came 
from the renewed flare- up of supply bottle -
necks for materials and raw materials as well as 
the very sharply increased construction prices. 
Demand was still brisk at the time of writing 
and should be bolstered by a robust labour 
market, also over the projection horizon. In 
addition, some of the savings built up involun -
tarily during the pandemic will be used to in -
vest in real estate.12 Lastly, housing construc -
tion investment, too, should benefit from the 
gradual easing of supply bottlenecks. However, 
with interest rates for construction at higher 
levels and households’ purchasing power being 
eroded by the high inflation, household invest -
ment activity will face considerable headwinds 
over the projection horizon. The number of 
new households being formed is also rising at 
a slower rate (in net terms) due to demographic 
factors. Overall, having made a strong start to 
the year, housing construction investment is 
likely to continue to increase markedly this 
year. It should more or less maintain this high Only modest pri -

11 According to the new BOP- HH survey results from 
March 2022, the saving ratio is likely to more or less return 
to its pre- pandemic level over the long run. The almost 
5,400 survey participants, having been told to imagine that 
the pandemic was over for good, were then asked whether 
they would spend a similar share of their income on con -
sumption in the long term as they did before the pan -
demic; see Deutsche Bundesbank (2022e). Three- quarters 
replied in the affirmative, while the remaining one- quarter 
were split almost equally, with 13% planning to increase 
their consumption ratio in the long term and 12% intend -
ing to reduce it. This therefore suggests the pandemic is 
unlikely to have a lasting impact on households’ saving and 
consumption behaviour. Nevertheless, the projection as -
sumes that the saving ratio will only return to its pre-  
pandemic level after the end of the projection horizon.

What are households using the additional savings 
 accumulated during the coronavirus pandemic for?
Private consumption has fl  uctuated signifi  -
cantly since the onset of the coronavirus 
pandemic. The waves of infection and the 
resulting protective measures caused con-
sumers to scale back their consumption, 
mainly either for fear of contagion or be-
cause opportunities to consume were un-
available.1 Because real disposable income 
remained broadly stable during this period 
–  partly owing to government support 
measures – the household saving ratio rose 
exceptionally strongly. Until recently, it was 
still above its level before the outbreak of 
the pandemic. Since the fi  rst quarter of 
2020, households have saved more each 
quarter than they probably would have 
done without the pandemic. These add-
itional accumulated savings (“coronavirus 
savings”) can be quantifi  ed by way of a 
comparison with the expectations from the 
December 2019 projection. This suggests 
that they now amount to roughly €185 bil-
lion.
Given that the measures taken to contain 
the pandemic were largely rolled back from 
the second quarter of 2022, private con-
sumption should actually receive a major 
boost as the elevated saving ratio returns to 
normal and coronavirus savings are subse-
quently used up – at least to some extent.2 
This assessment has been backed up in the 
past by survey results from the Bundesbank 
Online Panel Households (BOP- HH).3 How-
ever, the changes in the underlying condi-
tions resulting from high infl  ation and the 
further impact of the war in Ukraine are 
placing a considerable strain on households 
and their consumption plans. And it is pos-
sible that consumers may have altered their 
plans above and beyond those factors, too. 
In order to assess the evolution of these savings and their impact on the projection 
for private consumption, households were 
once again asked about their consumption 
behaviour as part of the BOP- HH.4 The re-
sults are based on responses received from 
5,380 people between 15 and 30  March 
2022, i.e. after the start of the war in 
Ukraine.
Just under one- third of respondents re-
ported that, on average, they consumed a 
smaller share of their household income in 
the last two years during the coronavirus 
pandemic than in 2018 and 2019.5 The 
coronavirus savings are therefore probably 
attributable to these households. When 
asked about the use of this additional dis-
posable money, the majority of the re-
spondents (weighted by household income) 
answered that they held it in the form of 
liquid funds (44%). This means that these 
funds are deposited in a current account or 
instant access savings account or held in 
cash. Respondents also used a total of 26% 
of the coronavirus savings for investment in

Beckmann and Schmidt (2020). An updated version is 
being prepared for future publication as a Bundesbank 
Technical Paper.

5 One year ago, half of the respondents reported that 
they had, on average, more money left over at the end 
of the month in the past 12 months than before the 
pandemic; see Deutsche Bundesbank (2021b). Some 
households have therefore not accumulated any add-
itional savings over the longer term, because of either 
increased consumption or reduced income since the 
last survey. In the current survey, the majority (55%) of 
respondents stated that, on average, they had con-
sumed a similar share of their household income as be-
fore the pandemic; the saving ratio of the remaining 
14% of respondents even declined.Deutsche Bundesbank

real estate or fi  nancial products and 9% for 
debt repayments.6
People who stated that their household 
held at least part of the additional leftover 
money in the form of liquid funds7 were 
asked how they thought they would use 
this money over the next 12 months. The 
respondents replied that they intended to 
keep a large portion of these coronavirus 
savings (39%) in the form of liquid funds.8 
However, households are still also planning 
to spend one-quarter of this money on the 
purchase of goods and services. Roughly speaking, they are therefore likely to con-
sume a total of around 11% (44% multi-
plied by 25%) of their remaining corona-
virus savings held in the form of liquid funds 
between April 2022 and March 2023. If 
these consumption and saving preferences 
are extrapolated – i.e. over the next rolling 
12- month period, one- quarter of the 
coronavirus savings available as liquid funds 
are always consumed and 39% are held in 
the form of liquid funds – households will 
consume around 16½% of coronavirus sav-
ings by the end of 2024.
Although this quantifi  cation confi  rms the 
assumption made in previous projections 
that private consumption will be given an 
additional boost by the depletion of corona-
virus savings, the projected share has fallen 
by more than one-half compared with the 
estimate based on the last survey.9 The re-
sults therefore suggest a certain, albeit 
limited, upward revision of the saving ratio 
over the projection horizon. Nevertheless, 
the ratio still looks set to temporarily 
“undershoot” its pre- pandemic level.Current uses of leftover coronavirus

8 Against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine and the 
associated uncertainties – also with regard to the al-
ready high levels of infl  ation – this could indicate a cer-
tain tendency towards “precautionary saving”. Ultim-
ately, some cost increases, especially for energy ex-
penditure (e.g. heating and electricity), will only take 
effect in the future.

lower bound of 25% and an upper bound of 45%; the

level in the coming year. From the current per -
spective, it could rise again slightly, if at all, in 
2024.
Real government investment is expected to rise 
at a very exceptionally strong rate in the projec -
tion due to increasing investment in military 
machinery and equipment.13 In view of the 
sharp rise in prices, the nominal growth rates 
are higher still, especially in the current year.
Real government consumption for the current 
year is expected to remain virtually unchanged 
compared with 2021, as declining coronavirus- 
related health expenditure is offset, amongst 
other things, by rising current military spend -
ing, payments for topping up gas reserves and 
expenditure on refugees.14 The year 2023 sees 
real government consumption drop signifi -
cantly, with health spending in connection with 
coronavirus largely tapering off and war- related 
spending declining somewhat. In 2024, real 
government consumption will, predominantly, 
increase in step with the economy as a whole.
Imports rise significantly over the projection 
horizon, in line with total demand. To begin 
with, though, they are likely to suffer a notice -
able setback in the current second quarter in 
the wake of declining exports and business in -
vestment. From the second half of the year on -
wards, the signs will again be pointing towards 
expansion, on the back of a renewed rise in ex -
port business and more vigorous investment, 
notably –  though not only  – in government 
machinery and equipment. Both of those 
things involve high import intensity intermedi -
ate goods, meaning that imports, too, will then 
see renewed strong growth. In addition, house -Government

Deutsche Bundesbank13 In the projection, investment in machinery and equip -
ment already rises steeply in the current year. However, the 
Armed Forces Special Fund, which was approved by the 
Bundestag after the projection was finalised, anticipates 
only very minimal expenditure in its economic plan for 
2022. This suggests that compared with the projection, ex -
penditure growth will be delayed. Overall, uncertainty is 
high about how the investment in machinery and equip -
ment will evolve.

hold demand will provide an added positive 
stimulus this year and a somewhat weaker one 
the next. Some of the additional savings accu -
mulated during the pandemic are likely to give 
a boost to imports of services, for instance 
through higher spending on foreign travel. 
However, this effect is now assessed to be 
weaker than expected in the December projec -
tion. In 2024, import growth will slacken again 
somewhat.
Germany’s current account surplus will dwindle 
substantially this year, potentially coming in at 
just over 4% of GDP on an annual average, 
down from 7½% in 2021. This reflects, first and 
foremost, the hugely deteriorated terms of 
trade resulting from the sharply increased 
prices of energy and other imported raw ma -
terials. Looking at real trade flows, however, 
growth in exports, which is more depressed 
than imports, is also playing a part. This devel -
opment will reverse to some extent over the re -
mainder of the projection horizon, especially with exports rising steeply as supply bottle -
necks ease. By contrast, in view of the assump -
tions made in the projection with regard to 
commodity prices and exchange rates, no re -
covery to speak of is expected when it comes 
to the terms of trade. As a result, the current 
account surplus will grow only slightly from its 
lower level in 2023. It could still be noticeably 
below 5%, but then somewhat higher than 
that in 2024 from today’s perspective.
Labour market
The labour market recovered strongly in the 
fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 
2022, after the last projection had expected 
the recovery process to be interrupted due to 
the drop- off in economic activity. However, 
employment and unemployment improved un -
abated and were recently back at pre- pandemic 
levels. The number of vacancies rose substan -
tially, and more firms are currently reporting 
difficulties in recruiting suitable staff than be -
fore the pandemic. Even so, recourse to short- 
time work rose moderately again around the 
turn of the year. Average hours worked per 
person in employment have arguably fallen in 
the past six months and are still markedly 
below the pre- pandemic level.
The opposing forces currently affecting eco -
nomic activity are also shaping the short- term 
outlook in the labour market and making it 
more uncertain. Now that most of the pan -
demic containment measures have been rolled 
back, the outlook in the services sector will im -
prove, with short- time work likely to fall steeply 
there and hours worked expected to rise. How -
ever, labour shortages will prove an obstacle to 
a rapid expansion of employment. In addition, 
resurgent supply chain problems, the elevated 
uncertainty surrounding the war in Ukraine and 
high energy prices are dampening labour de -
mand in the manufacturing sector. Employ -
ment growth is therefore expected to weaken

overall. Unemployment will arguably barely fall 
any further.
July and October 2022 will see the general 
statutory minimum wage rise in two stages to 
€12 per hour, leaving it around one- quarter 
higher in the fourth quarter than one year ago. 
This means that the fourth quarter alone will 
probably see the wage bill increase almost as 
sharply as it did when the minimum wage was 
introduced in 2015.15 Back then, the adverse 
effects on employment were concentrated in 
the low- paid part- time employment segment. 
This group is likely to be affected most by ad -
justment responses this time around, too. 
However, there is reason to believe that fewer 
part- time casual positions (“mini- jobs”) will be 
lost than in 2015. Labour shortages now ex -
tend into the unskilled labour segment. Fur -
thermore, with major structural change under 
way in more productive sectors, even people 
who lose their jobs are quickly able to find a 
new one.16 Moreover, entrepreneurs are argu -
ably finding it easier in the current setting to 
push through price increases than it was in 
2015. Nevertheless, there is likely to be a short- 
term blip in employment growth in the fourth 
quarter of 2022. Even so, unemployment will 
rise only marginally, as the people working in 
mini- jobs – who will bear the brunt – are either 
already registered as unemployed or are not 
seeking employment subject to social security 
contributions at all.
The labour force participation rate of the Ger -
man population ought to recover quickly from 
its pandemic- induced dip.17 Of late, the labour 
force was back to almost its pre- pandemic size. 
Demographic shifts in the domestic population, 
which have been under way for some time 
now, will continue to weigh on the labour sup -
ply over the projection horizon. Increased im -
migration could mitigate the high degree of la -
bour market tightness that this entails. After 
the reduction in immigration brought about by 
the pandemic, certain catch- up effects were al -
ready in play in the second half of 2021. At 
207,000, net immigration to Germany was around 60% higher than the reference figure 
from the pre- pandemic year of 2019.18 Follow -

17 During the pandemic, some workers exited the labour 
market (temporarily), remained in the education system for 
longer or ended their working life somewhat earlier than 
planned. It is to be assumed that this effect will disappear 
fairly quickly, as there has been no long- term, structural de -
terioration in the underlying labour market conditions. See 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2021c).
18 Immigration was thus also markedly higher than ex -
pected in the previous projection. Refugees, particularly 
from Syria and Afghanistan, accounted for a very consider -
able proportion of that increase, however. Labour- market 
integration is considerably less straightforward for such ar -
rivals than in the case of labour- market oriented immigra -
tion, from other EU Member States for instance.Deutsche Bundesbank

Germany is one of the countries where many 
Ukrainians are now seeking refuge. Whether 
this will produce a substantial increase in the 
labour supply is uncertain, however.19 This pro -
jection reckons with a net total of 700,000 im -
migrants to Germany this year, and 300,000 
persons per year from 2023.20 Overall, the la -
bour force is expected to grow further in 2023. 
From 2024 onwards, however, the negative 
demographic trend will regain the upper hand 
and the labour supply will shrink.
As early as 2023, labour supply is likely to be 
the limiting factor for employment growth. The 
number of people in employment will then in -
crease only slightly and could peak in the 
course of 2024. Unemployment will barely get 
any lower over those two years. The integra -
tion of the many immigrants will counteract 
the reduction in worker unemployment. More -
over, the accelerated structural change brought 
about by digitalisation and shifts to other en -
ergy sources will generate frictions in the la -
bour market. In terms of working hours per 
person in employment, in particular, there is 
capacity for expanding the number of hours 
worked. The volume of overtime hours is likely 
to increase further as the economy recovers. 
The weekly working hours of part- time workers 
have been on the rise for several years now 
and the figure for those in full- time employ -
ment is stable. The slight increase in part- time 
employment as a share of total employment 
continues to exert a counteractive effect. Given 
the tight labour market, however, hours 
worked are liable to rise in the medium term, 
too. With expanded opportunities for working 
from home and increasing childcare capacity, 
many employees could up their working hours.
Labour costs and prices
Wage settlements concluded since the begin -
ning of the year have been comparatively mod -
erate overall, when measured against the high 
rates of inflation. However, as the economy re -
bounds, wage bargainers are likely to agree on distinctly higher new settlements over the re -
mainder of the year. New collective wage 
agreements for important sectors are due from 
the fourth quarter onwards, as wage bargain -
ers in the chemicals and metal- working and 
electrical engineering industries negotiate sal -
ary increases. While the trade unions are look -
ing for deals that fully offset the high rates of 
inflation, they will probably only come away 
with partial compensation at first.21 Next year, 
too, when a major pay round is due, the con -
tinued high rates of inflation, along with the 
economic recovery and mounting labour short -
ages, are likely to contribute to stronger wage 
increases. On top of this, there is the potential 
for catch- up effects making up for the subdued 
wage increases contained in the collective 
wage agreements concluded during the pan -
demic. The year 2024 could see wage growth 
increase further still, mainly as a result of the in -
tensifying labour market tightness. This means 
that negotiated pay rates will increase almost 
as steeply this year and next as they did in the 
economic boom before the pandemic, and 
even more sharply at the end of the projection 
horizon.22
Actual earnings will arguably once again rise 
considerably more steeply this year than nego -
tiated wages. This is largely due to the further Little movement

and unemploy -
ment in 2023 
and 2024; cap -

19 It has initially been primarily women with children who 
have fled to Germany. Although it can generally be as -
sumed that these women possess a high readiness to work 
and are well- qualified, they often have childcare responsi -
bilities. Furthermore, there are language barriers to be 
overcome and it is difficult to foresee how long arrivals will 
stay on in Germany, depending on how the war progresses 
and given that those affected are very keen to return.
20 Together with the increased immigration in 2021, this 
will mean around 300,000 more members of the labour 
force are expected over the projection horizon than as -
sumed in the December projection.
21 There have been times in the past, too, when the trade 
unions only managed to have their demands partially met. 
It is also important to bear the current situation in mind: 
taken in isolation, the higher prices for fossil fuels – which 
are largely imported – narrow the scope for income distri -
bution within Germany.
22 All past pay agreements included in the Bundesbank’s 
negotiated pay rate statistics (around 500 collective wage 
agreements and provisions governing civil servant pay) are 
factored into the projections of negotiated wage increases. 
They are extrapolated beyond their contractual term, tak -
ing into account the overall economic situation and 
industry- specific idiosyncrasies.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

decline in short- time work and rising working 
hours. Another factor are higher performance- 
based bonuses on the part of industrial groups. 
In addition, the increase in the general statu -
tory minimum wage to €12 per hour in the 
fourth quarter of 2022 will trigger a robust 
boost to wages, albeit one which will not fully 
come to bear in annual average terms until 
2023.23 Furthermore, over the remainder of the 
projection horizon, more paid overtime and, 
above all, the mounting labour market tight -
ness are likely to contribute to stronger wage 
increases. Wage drift is therefore set to be con -
sistently positive. Nominal wage increases are 
at almost 4½% over all three years in the pro -
jection horizon, a phenomenon which has not 
been seen since German reunification. Never -
theless, these strong increases will not suffice 
initially to fully compensate for the high infla -
tion rate. The year 2024 is likely to be the first 
to see any marked rise in real wages as meas -
ured by the HICP .
Compensation per employee will rise at simi -
larly high rates as actual earnings over the pro -
jection horizon, even exhibiting a somewhat 
steeper increase in 2024, as employers’ signifi -
cantly rising social contributions will have an 
impact here. In terms of unit labour costs, this 
means that – following their subdued growth 
last year – they will see a particularly substan -
tial rise of roughly 3½% this year. The fact that 
the increased economic headwinds will tem -
porarily dampen growth in labour productivity 
(per employed person) is the key factor here. 
This is a reflection of the comparatively robust 
recovery in the labour market. In the coming 
year, labour productivity will return to a course 
of stronger growth, meaning that unit labour 
costs will rise more moderately, by around 
2½%. From today’s perspective, they are likely 
to climb somewhat more strongly again in 
2024, however. The price pressure exerted by 
labour costs will therefore be consistently high 
over the projection horizon. Taken in isolation, 
this limits the scope for higher profit margins, 
which were widened to a considerable degree 
last year. At the same time, the sharp rise in en -ergy prices is putting pressure on firms’ profit -
ability. Having said that, the current setting is 
still characterised by high demand, making it 
easy to pass on rising costs.24 Overall, the rise

Projection
23 The higher minimum wage is expected to push up ac -
tual earnings by around 0.8  percentage point. See 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2022f). Increases to the general 
statutory minimum wage will already have come on 
1 January 2022 and 1 July 2022. In macroeconomic terms, 
these rises will have a stronger impact on actual wages 
than on negotiated wages, even if the latter will be af -
fected strongly in some low- wage sectors, such as the hos -
pitality industry.
24 In sectors that were particularly hard- hit by the 
pandemic- related restrictions, prices could even rise dispro -
portionately to make up for past losses.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

year is likely to still be somewhat higher than 
the growth in unit labour costs. In 2024, it 
could lag somewhat behind it, however. With 
an increase of around 2½%, domestic inflation 
as measured by the GDP deflator would still be 
significantly elevated, though.
The already extremely high inflation rate in -
creased further still in the fourth quarter of 
2021 and the first quarter of 2022. Inflation (as 
measured by the HICP) reached an all- time high 
of 7.8% in April 2022.25 The last time Germany 
experienced such high inflation rates was dur -
ing the oil price crisis in the 1970s. In the De -
cember projection, however, the rate had been 
expected to decline to around 4%. The fact 
that inflation overshot expectations by such a 
degree was primarily, but not solely, due to the 
energy component. Even before Russia’s attack 
on Ukraine, inflation was, on a broad basis, 
more pronounced than expected. The war and 
its repercussions have exacerbated price pres -
sures which were already high anyway. Crude 
oil prices rose drastically, for instance. In add -
ition, this doubtless pushed up other costs of 
mineral oil production. At the consumer level, 
the prices of petrol and heating oil thus rose by 
just under 30% between February and March 
alone. The impact on food prices was also 
huge, leaving them almost 7% higher than in 
the previous year in April. The December pro -
jection had not even reckoned with a rate half 
that high. The prices of non- energy industrial 
goods also went up much more strongly than 
expected, probably owing to resurgent supply 
bottlenecks and the rise in commodity prices. 
Prices for services also surprised to the upside. 
This was partly attributable to travel services, 
where the sharp rise in oil prices is likely to 
have played a role. However, prices for the 
other services components also rose more 
strongly than expected.
HICP inflation is expected to come down only 
very slowly over the remainder of the year.26 
This is because price pressure will remain high 
for now: the assumption is that crude oil prices 
will fall markedly, but, at the same time, other significant cost increases for fuel and heating 
oil are likely to persist for a while yet. Further -
more, the previous huge increase in market 
prices for natural gas will probably continue to 
be passed on to consumers.27 It is likely that 
price rises have not yet reached their peak 
where food is concerned, either. European 
agricultural producer prices are projected to in -
crease by around 40% overall this year. This is 
partly a reflection of the fallout from the war, 
as producer prices for goods such as wheat 
– which Ukraine plays a key role in exporting – 
will be subject to even stronger price hikes. The 
war also pushed up costs for other production 
components, such as the price of fertilizers. 
Lastly, October’s significant increase in the 
statutory minimum wage will affect some parts 
of the food sector especially strongly, one of 
these being the bakery trade.
Prices for non- energy industrial goods, too, will 
arguably increase considerably this year. Supply 
bottlenecks are likely to remain the main rea -
son behind this, alongside the higher energy 
commodity prices. In addition, pandemic-  
related business closures could have a retro -
spective inflationary effect on the prices of 
some service providers if these agents seek to 
make up for previously incurred losses by 
widening their margins once the containment 
measures have expired. The renewed rise in la -
bour costs will probably be another source of 
price pressure, which usually has an impact on 
service providers, in particular. Here, too, there 
are some sectors, such as hairdressing and taxi Inflation rate

25 The since- published May 2022 flash estimate was not 
yet available when the projection was finalised.
26 Government relief measures can only dampen the price 
pressures somewhat. The reduction in fuel tax, the launch 
of a €9 ticket for local public transport between June and 
August and the government’s defrayal of the renewable 
energy levy (EEG levy) on electricity prices starting in July 
will have direct price effects. The estimated price effects of 
these measures are shown in the table on p. 32.
27 Energy prices are also being affected by the increase in 
the carbon price applied to the use of fossil fuels that came 
into force at the start of the year. This is likely to drive the 
headline rate up by somewhat less than 0.2 percentage 
point this year. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2019).Deutsche Bundesbank

firms, that are particularly affected by the in -
crease in the minimum wage to €12 per hour.28
Combining the developments in the individual 
components, the HICP rate could increase to 
7.1% in 2022. That is more than twice the rate 
recorded one year previously and by far the 
highest rate since the start of monetary union. 
The core inflation rate (excluding energy and 
food) could rise from 2.2% to 3.6%, which is 
three times higher than the long- term average.
Starting next year, inflation is likely to recede 
gradually. It is assumed that energy commodity 
prices will fall significantly. However, as the 
surge in market prices for natural gas and elec -
tricity is, in part, only expected to be passed on 
to end customers with something of a time lag, 
energy price increases in 2023 will still be mark -
edly above average and might only normalise 
again in 2024.29 Food prices, too, will see infla -
tion pressures subsiding according to the as -
sumptions for commodity prices. That said, ro -bust wage growth and the costs associated 
with the transition towards more sustainable 
and animal- friendly production methods will 
continue to provide momentum. Inflation rates 
will therefore be lower in the subsequent years, 
but still higher than average. The inflation rate 
excluding energy and food is also likely to de -
cline. This is mainly because the price pressures 
stemming from the supply bottlenecks will 
gradually ease over the projection horizon and 
the indirect effects of the high energy prices as 
well as the increase in the prices of (non-  
energy) imports will diminish. Multiple factors 
are partly working in the opposite direction to Inflation likely to

vices sectors when the statutory minimum wage was intro -
duced in 2015. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2015). The im -
pact on the basket of goods as a whole is likely to remain 
limited, however. For example, the effect of the minimum 
wage on the HICP rate will probably only come to just 
under two- tenths of one percent over the entire projection 
horizon. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2022f).

this. One is that the intense pressure emanat -
ing from labour costs will increasingly make it -
self felt, especially as the economic situation 
improves. Second- round effects from the earl -
ier sharp rise in consumer prices via the wage 
channel are another factor, albeit a limited one. There are also lagged effects from the robust 
increase in the minimum wage in autumn 
2022. Lastly, the German economy’s transition 
to climate neutrality and independence from 
fossil fuels – a matter which gained greater ur -
gency as a result of the war in Ukraine – will ar -
guably also go hand in hand with growing cost 
pressures.
The headline HICP rate could decline to 4.5% 
in 2023 and to 2.6% in 2024, while the infla -
tion rate excluding energy and food could de -
cline first to 3.2% in 2023 and then to 2.4% in 
2024. That would leave the inflation rates still 
markedly higher at the end of the projection 
horizon than their longer- term averages.
Public finances
According to this projection, 2022 will see the 
general government deficit ratio decline to 
around 2¾% (2021: 3.7%). This will mainly be 
due to a significant reduction in the fiscal bur -
dens caused by the coronavirus crisis. In add -
ition, revenue will benefit from the dynamic 
growth in gross wages and salaries and nom -
inal private consumption. By contrast, new 
measures will have a dampening effect (for in -

over, expenditure on pension, health and long- 
term care insurance schemes is growing signifi -
cantly. The strong price increases are driving up 
the cost of government consumption and in -
vestment, in particular.
The year 2023 will see the deficit ratio fall sig -
nificantly to 1½% since the measures taken in 
response to the coronavirus crisis and the sup -
port provided to offset the high energy costs 
will have largely expired by then. In addition, 
the government budget will benefit from the 
ongoing economic recovery. There will be 
hardly any change in the deficit ratio in 2024. 
Growing deficits posted by central government 
off- budget entities for climate protection and 
the German armed forces will offset alleviating 
factors in other areas.
The structural general government deficit will 
move upwards toward 1½% of GDP over the 
projection horizon.30 Deficits are projected 
mainly for central government, particularly its 
special funds. Before the coronavirus crisis, 
central government was still recording a struc -
tural general government surplus (2019: ½% of 
GDP). This turnaround is mainly attributable to 
rising expenditure, particularly on defence and 
climate protection, but also in the social sphere 
– mainly in the areas of pensions and long-  
term care. The structural primary expenditure 
ratio (excluding interest expenditure) will con -
tinue to rise significantly over the projection 
horizon.
The debt ratio will fall significantly over the pro -
jection horizon to around 63% (2021: 69.3%). 
This is mainly on account of the relatively 
strong growth of nominal GDP in the denomin -
ator. Despite the deficits, this causes the ratio 
to decline. Moreover, debt-  increasing one- off 
effects related to the coronavirus pandemic 
that are not reflected in the deficit will wane. 
For example, assistance loans will be repaid. 
Existing cash reserves are also likely to be used 
to finance the budget, which will reduce bor -
rowing requirements. In addition, the port -folios of state- owned bad banks will diminish 
further.
Risk assessment
The macroeconomic projections described here 
are subject to an exceptionally high level of un -
certainty in the current environment. The great -
est uncertainties include further developments 
in the war in Ukraine, including its economic 
knock- on effects, the global dynamics of the 
pandemic and the impact of high inflation. 
From today’s perspective, the risks to economic 
growth appear to be tilted to the downside in 
overall terms, mainly due to the possibility of 
Russian energy supplies being halted. With re -
gard to inflation, upside risks predominate 
throughout the projection horizon. These risks 
already partly materialised after the projection 
was finalised. On account of the surprisingly 
high inflation momentum in May, the annual 
average HICP rate for 2022 could already 
amount to 7¾%, as things currently stand.

nomic outlook due to the war in Ukraine. How -
ever, these could turn out to be considerably 
more severe still. If the conflict were to inten -
sify, the duration and intensity of the direct and 
indirect effects would increase. In this context, 
there could also be a stoppage of all deliveries 
of Russian energy products – either by an im -
port embargo imposed by the EU and its part -
ners or by Russia unilaterally halting its deliver -
ies. Germany’s dependence on Russian energy 
sources has already been reduced significantly 
since the outbreak of the war (see the box on 
pp. 35ff.). But still, in such an adverse risk scen -
ario, the German economy would arguably ex -
perience a pronounced decline in economic ac -
tivity, which would be accompanied by further 
price rises (see the box on pp. 35ff.).31 If, on 
the other hand, the situation eases unexpect -
edly quickly, economic activity could turn out 
to be higher and the inflation rate lower.
The ongoing pandemic continues to pose a 
downside risk to economic activity, too. Al -
though Germany lifted most of the coronavirus 
containment measures in the spring, in China, 
protective measures continue to considerably 
curtail social life, unleashing some severe con -
sequences not just for China’s economy but for 
global activity as well. For example, lockdowns 
imposed in several major cities, such as Shang -
hai, home to the world’s largest container port, dampened economic activity and intensified 
global supply chain disruptions. Should the 
global economy come to a standstill amid sus -
tained disruptions in China, supply bottle -
necks32 could turn out to be even more persist -
ent and foreign demand weaker than expected 
over the projection horizon. This would weigh 
on German exports and investment. However, 
the further course of the pandemic in Germany 
also harbours risks. If – in the autumn, say – in -
fection rates worsen, for example as a result of 
new virus variants, and more extensive protect -
ive measures need to be re- imposed, private 
consumption could suffer a further setback.
In Germany, further risks can be identified in 
both directions with regard to private con -
sumption. Households could use the additional 
savings they accumulated during the pandemic 
for future consumption expenditure to a 
greater or lesser extent than assumed here. The 
related uncertainties mainly stem from possible 
interactions with the high inflation and the un -
certainty surrounding how long it will persist, 
as well as concerns about developments in the 
war in Ukraine.
The outlook for price inflation was already sub -
ject to a high degree of uncertainty in past pro -
jections. Against the backdrop of the pandemic 
and its specific features, it was unclear for 
some time to what extent historical relation -
ships still apply. This is increasingly being called 
into question by the fact that inflation keeps on 
being significantly underestimated and by the 
extremely high inflation rates. Since the 
 outbreak of the war in Ukraine, price increases 
have exceeded expectations by a wider margin 
still. With a possible stoppage of Russian en -Downside risks

Possible development of the German economy 
in an adverse risk scenario
Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine 
and its impact on the global economy have 
shaped the assumptions underlying the 
macroeconomic projection (see the box on 
pp. 17 ff.). An adverse risk scenario was de-
veloped as a way of accounting for the pre-
vailing uncertainty surrounding key assump-
tions. Unlike in the baseline scenario, the 
assumption here is an escalation of the con-
fl  ict.1 This assumption is associated with a 
further intensifi  cation and expansion of the 
sanctions imposed, starting from the sum-
mer of this year. Energy and food commod-
ity prices register stronger increases and 
persist at higher levels throughout the pro-
jection horizon. Another assumption is a 
complete and permanent stoppage of Rus-
sian energy exports to the European Union 
(EU). This leads to energy rationing and cut-
backs in production in EU countries. In add-
ition, this scenario assumes that further dis-
ruptions in foreign trade and increased sup-
ply chain problems will materialise. In par-
ticular, food exports from Ukraine and 
Russia decline more sharply than in the 
baseline scenario. Overall, it is assumed that 
macroeconomic uncertainty and fi  nancial 
market volatility will increase. Compared 
with the baseline scenario, monetary and 
fi  scal policy is assumed to remain un-
changed.2
Rationing effects given a stoppage 
of gas supplies
A loss of Russian energy supplies from the 
third quarter of 2022 leads to gas supply 
bottlenecks over the scenario horizon. The 
absence of Russian deliveries of crude oil 
and bituminous coal is assumed not to re-
sult in any rationing effects given that inde-
pendence from these supplies has now largely been achieved.3 The size of the gas 
gap – that is, the amount by which gas de-Major assumptions in the adverse

1 The adverse scenario was specifi  ed as part of the Eu-
rosystem’s macroeconomic projections and simulated 
by all Eurosystem national central banks. It is based on 
assumptions made jointly by Eurosystem experts, and 
the results form part of the scenario calculated for the 
euro area as a whole. See European Central Bank 
(2022). The effects on the development of exporters’ 
foreign sales markets and competitors’ prices were cal-
culated by ECB staff and made available to the na-
tional central banks. The same was done with an esti-
mation of movements in lending rates and the equity 
market. Earlier Bundesbank calculations concerning 
the possible macroeconomic repercussions of the 
Ukraine war in a similarly defi  ned risk scenario can be 
found in Deutsche Bundesbank (2022g). Similarities to 
and differences from these earlier calculations are dis-
cussed at appropriate points later on in this text (see, 
in particular, p. 26 f.).
2 As far as fi  scal policy in Germany is concerned, this 
means, for the calculations presented here, that no add-
itional fi  scal measures are assumed beyond the auto-
matic stabilisers included endogenously in the model.
3 Since the beginning of 2022, Germany’s reliance on 
Russian deliveries of these two commodities has been 
reduced signifi  cantly; see Federal Ministry for Eco-
nomic Affairs and Climate Action (2022). The share of 
Russian supplies of bituminous coal still came to 
around 8% at the beginning of May 2022, and the 
EU’s fi  fth package of restrictive measures legislates 
that complete independence is to be achieved by mid- 
August 2022. As regards crude oil, Germany is still de-
pendent on Russia for around 12% of its supplies at 
present, with the bulk of this being accounted for by 
the Schwedt refi  nery. Subject to a certain transitional 
period, this refi  nery can, however, be supplied with al-
ternative deliveries via the ports of Rostock and 
Gdańsk; see Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and 
Climate Action (2022).Deutsche Bundesbank

mand exceeds the available supply  – de-
pends on multiple aspects. These include 
the volume of Russian supplies that needs 
to be replaced as well as the possibility of 
sourcing gas from other countries at short 
notice.4 Adjustments by energy consumers 
are another key aspect – a number of re-
cent studies indicate that signifi  cant savings 
can be achieved in natural gas consump-
tion, including in the short term.5 The ex-
pected topping up of the natural gas reser-
voirs is another important factor to con-
sider. Based on how gas storage levels have 
changed on average since the beginning of 
May 2022, it is assumed that the gas reser-
voirs are more than 60% full at the begin-
ning of July 2022.
The time profi  le of the gap in the supply of 
gas is determined, fi  rst, by the speed at 
which supplies are expanded and by the 
scope for savings.6 Second, seasonal pat-
terns in natural gas consumption, the priori-
tisation of certain consumer groups and fi  ll-
ing levels in gas reservoirs are also factors. 
Gas consumption tends to decrease signifi  -
cantly in the summer months, allowing nat-
ural gas reservoirs to be topped up for the 
winter period. Since priority is given by law 
to the supply of gas to essential social ser-
vices and household customers as well as to 
small and medium- sized enterprises in busi-
ness, trade and services, industry will be dis-
proportionately hard hit by the effects of 
gas rationing.7 The modelling makes the as-
sumption that two- fi  fths of industry is sup-
plied with gas throughout so that, for ex-
ample, the production of essential inter-
mediate inputs and fi  nal goods is assured 
and production facilities do not suffer any 
permanent damage.8 The fi  nal assumption 
made in the model is that gas reservoirs 
have a certain minimum fi  lling level in all 
months in order to safeguard the future 
supply of protected customers and to ac-
count for the uncertainty surrounding ex-pected gas consumption – for example, in 
the event of stronger demand during an 
4 According to the Federal Ministry for Economic Af-
fairs and Climate Action, Germany was dependent on 
Russia for 35% of its gas supplies in April of this year. 
Compared with the previous years, where fi  gures aver-
aged 55%, a signifi  cant reduction has already been 
achieved within the fi  rst few months of this year. This 
was mainly due to the expansion of supplies from 
other countries, which could persist. Furthermore, the 
present calculation assumes that additional supplies 
will become available in Germany via fl  oating LNG ter-
minals from January 2023 and that these capacities 
will be gradually expanded from mid- 2023 onwards. 
From the third quarter of 2024, the expansion of sup-
plies and the assumed savings result in Germany’s gas 
supply becoming independent of Russian deliveries. 
This independence would be achieved somewhat 
sooner than anticipated by the Federal Ministry for 
Economic Affairs and Climate Action owing to the as-
sumed higher adjustment pressure; see Federal Minis-
try for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (2022).
5 See German Association of Energy and Water Indus-
tries (2022), Forschungszentrum Jülich (2022) and Ger-
man Institute for Economic Research (2022). In the 
scenario calculations, it is assumed that savings are 
made by industry, households, business, trade and ser-
vices, transport, and in the generation of electricity 
and heat. Overall savings in terms of gas consumption 
come to around 18% in the fi  rst four quarters after 
supplies are stopped. Starting in summer 2023, owing 
to the horizon that will then be available for adjust-
ments, further savings of 10 percentage points are as-
sumed (i.e. a total of 28% relative to pre- embargo 
consumption).
6 For a further scenario analysis with an intra- year gas 
gap, see also Joint Economic Forecast Project Group 
(2022).
7 See Section 53a of the German Energy Industry Act 
(Gesetz über die Elektrizitäts- und Gasversorgung). In 
this context, the area of business, trade and services 
comprises all craft industries and enterprises with up to 
19 employees from the production sector as well as all 
enterprises in the trade and services sector. The as-
sumption here is that two- thirds of the business, trade 
and services area belongs to the prioritised group.
8 The decision on the rationing of non- protected cus-
tomers at the emergency level of the Emergency Plan 
for Gas for the Federal Republic of Germany (see Fed-
eral Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (2019)) is 
taken by the Federal Network Agency. According to 
the Federal Network Agency, multiple criteria play a 
key role in this regard; these include, for example, con-
sidering the lead times needed for shutdowns, pre-
venting damage to the economy and businesses, safe-
guarding supplies of critical end products such as food 
and pharmaceuticals and the availability of substitutes 
in production; see Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 
(2022) and Federal Network Agency (2022).Deutsche Bundesbank

unusually cold winter.9 This means that con-
sumption by the remaining, unprotected 
gas customers will have to be throttled in 
the period from the third quarter of 2022 to 
the second quarter of 2023 by just under 
one- third on average. A certain gas gap will 
exist from the third quarter of 2023 as well, 
albeit one that is signifi  cantly smaller than 
in the preceding four quarters.
A sectoral input- output model can be used 
to roughly estimate the economic effects of 
constraints in the supply of gas.10 Amongst 
other things, this model depicts the supply 
chains across the sectors of the German 
economy based on the linkages between 
intermediate inputs contained in the system 
of accounts. In the calculations, the directly 
affected sectors in industry and services are 
exposed to different degrees to the gas ra-
tioning shock. Sectors with a higher input 
of natural gas in production relative to their 
value added – such as chemicals sector or 
metal- working industry  – are hit harder 
than those where the natural gas intensity 
of production is low.11
According to the model calculations, the 
production losses caused by the stoppage 
of gas supplies would lead to losses in value 
added of 3¼% in the period from the third 
quarter of 2022 to the second quarter of 
2023.12 In this regard, the effect of gas ra-
tioning would mainly be felt in the fi  rst 
quarter of next year, which is why much of 
the loss in gross domestic product (GDP) 
materialises in 2023. The GDP losses com-
puted for the period from the third quarter 
of 2023 to the second quarter of 2024, at 
1¼%, are signifi  cantly smaller than in the 
preceding four quarters owing to the 
smaller size of the gas gap. Strong amplifi  -9 The fi  lling level requirements laid down in the Ger-
man Gas Storage Act (Gasspeichergesetz), by contrast, 
are not fully met in the scenario calculation. In an 
emergency, these could be subordinated behind the 
other criteria of the Federal Network Agency (see the 
German Act Amending the Energy Industry Act – Ge-
setz zur Änderung des Energiewirtschaftsgesetzes zur 
Einführung von Füllstandsvorgaben für Gasspeicher-
anlagen sowie zur Änderung von § 246 des Bau-
gesetzbuchs). In the scenario calculation the minimum 
fi  lling level that must be guaranteed each month is set 
at 10%.
10 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2022g).
11 For industrial sectors with a high intensity of natural 
gas input (measured by the ratio of natural gas input 
to value added), it is assumed that a decline in the sup-
ply of natural gas of 31% (Q3 2022 to Q2 2023) and 
of 11% (Q3 2023 to Q2 2024) leads to an identical per-
centage decline in output. For an overview of these 
sectors, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2022g). For the re-
maining sectors, the shock level is adjusted down-
wards according to their lower intensity of natural gas 
input as well as the percentage of the prioritised con-
sumer groups they account for.
12 The quarterly profi  le of the GDP losses is derived 
from the quarterly shares of the gas gap per year. To 
smooth the rationing effects, it is assumed that a con-
stant share of the gas consumption of unprotected 
customers is cut between the fourth quarter of 2022 
and the second quarter of 2024. This assumption af-
fects neither the size of the gas gap nor the accumu-
lated economic losses. It infl  uences only the distribu-
tion of GDP losses over the quarters and thus allows 
the rationing effects to be better integrated into the 
following simulation with the Bundesbank’s macro-
econometric model. Without this assumption, the GDP 
losses would be even more strongly concentrated in 
the fi  rst quarter of 2024.Potential GDP losses due to production

cation effects via supply chains increase the 
original shock effect to two- and- a- half 
times the size. This can be explained by the 
fact that some of the sectors that are par-
ticularly strongly affected supply important 
intermediate inputs for other production 
areas.13
Macroeconomic effects
The macroeconomic effects of the scen-
ario are estimated using the Bundesbank’s 
macroeconometric model (BbkM- DE).14 
The effects of gas rationing are also fed 
into the simulations carried out using the 
BbkM- DE model.15 The uniform model 
framework means that it is possible to 
combine the time profi  le of production 
losses caused by a lack of gas supplies 
with the other assumptions regarding the 
macroeconomic environment (concerning, 
inter alia, developments in commodity 
prices and sales markets as well as uncer-
tainty effects). This way, it is also possible 
to quantify their impact on the infl  ation 
rate and include macroeconomic feedback 
effects, such as those channelled via the 
labour market. Since the BbkM- DE model 
determines GDP via its expenditure com-
ponents, as is customary with this class of 
model, the sector- specific production 
losses are distributed across the compon-
ents of fi  nal expenditure using data from 
the input- output tables on the breakdown 
of the respective product groups.16 Imple-
mentation in BbkM- DE by means of apply-
ing additional shocks to the expenditure- 
side GDP components nonetheless takes 
into consideration the supply- side nature 
of the production cutbacks.17
The simulation calculations indicate the 
most severe strain on real GDP for the com-
ing year. The key reason for this, alongside 
the rationing effects, will be the slump in 
German exporters’ sales markets.18 Overall, the shortfall of the real GDP level relative to 
the baseline scenario widens from around 
1½% in the current year to roughly 6¾% in 
2023. GDP then declines by just over 3% 
relative to the year 2022 instead of growing 
by just under 2½% as assumed in the base-
line scenario. That said, GDP growth in 
2024 is considerably stronger in the adverse 
than in the baseline scenario. Even so, the 
13 The size of this factor is determined above all by the 
composition of the sectors affected by the shock and 
their relative position within the German production 
network. It cannot be ruled out that the amplifi  cation 
effects via supply chain linkages in the chosen model 
framework are being underestimated. See, for ex-
ample, Deutsche Bundesbank (2022g) and Krebs 
(2022).
14 As performed in Deutsche Bundesbank (2022g), 
the uncertainty effects and disaggregated price effects 
on the HICP components energy and food are quanti-
fi  ed using satellite models and then fed into the simu-
lations. For details on BbkM- DE, see Haertel et al. 
(2022).
15 This was not implemented in this manner in earlier 
simulation calculations by the Bundesbank; see 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2022g).
16 According to this approach, exports are hurt most 
by the gas rationing, followed by investment in ma-
chinery and equipment and other fi  xed investment. Pri-
vate consumption is less affected. In the distribution of 
production cutbacks across expenditure components, 
it is assumed that if a particular good is unavailable, 
economic agents do not switch to available alterna-
tives beyond the extent that has already been assumed 
when calculating the rationing effects (see also foot-
note 22). This appears to be a plausible approach, es-
pecially in the case of key investment and exports.
17 To this end, it is assumed that the thus induced de-
cline in GDP , which can be attributed in economic 
terms to the production cutbacks, has no impact on 
the output gap. A possible price- dampening effect in-
duced by the rationing is thus eliminated. In addition, 
it is assumed that when enterprises set their prices, 
they allow the infl  uence of the productivity declines to 
feed through into unit labour costs in line with the 
estimated behavioural equations. The price increases 
produced as a result were checked for plausibility 
using a structural vector autoregression model.
18 The transmission channels in the charts are defi  ned 
differently than those presented in Deutsche Bundes-
bank (2022g), where the contribution of German for-
eign demand comprised only the direct disruptions in 
bilateral foreign trade with Ukraine and Russia. Indirect 
effects of higher commodity prices on sales markets in 
other countries were attributed to the commodity 
price channel. In Deutsche Bundesbank (2022g), the 
illustrated  effect of foreign competitors’ prices had 
been distributed across the transmission channels 
shown therein, with by far the bulk being accounted 
for by the commodity price channel. Unlike in Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2022g), the depicted uncertainty channel 
also explicitly contains the effects of higher lending 
rates and lower equity prices.Deutsche Bundesbank

level of real GDP is then still 4½% below 
that of the baseline scenario.
The infl  ation rate exceeds the rates from 
the baseline scenario in the current year, 
particularly on account of the higher oil 
prices. It is not until the year after that the 
increases in gas prices feed through into 
consumer prices. That same year is also 
when the price increases resulting from the 
production cutbacks become apparent. Ac-
cording to the simulations, the infl  uences of 
the oil price and production losses will fade 
out in 2024 and the persistently lower de-
mand from abroad will dampen price devel-
opments. Overall, the infl  ation rate in the 
adverse scenario would be ½ percentage 
point higher on average for the current year 
and somewhat more than 1½ percentage 
points higher in 2023 than the rates simu-
lated in the baseline scenario, before the ef-
fect weakens to just under ¼ percentage 
point in 2024.
The effects calculated in the simulations 
mean that, in this adverse scenario, the 
German economy experiences a temporary 
considerable contraction instead of follow-
ing a subdued recovery path, as envisioned 
in the baseline scenario. While GDP growth 
still manages to remain slightly positive on 
average in 2022 (see the table on p. 43), 
this is only thanks to the increase in GDP in 
the second half of 2021.19 The rationing ef-
fects that begin to emerge in the coming 
winter in particular cause GDP to decline 
sharply in 2023. The economy recovers 
from that setback in 2024 but does not yet 
return to its pre- pandemic output level. At 
the same time, the infl  ation rate is very high 
for a longer period. In 2024, infl  ation will 
be somewhat higher still than what is al-

ready envisioned in the baseline scenario of 
the projection.
Interpreting the results
Given how dynamically the situation has 
evolved since the start of the war against 
Ukraine, the time at which this adverse 
scenario was prepared is key to how the re-
sults are interpreted. This also means that 
there are deviations from earlier calcula-
tions prepared by the Bundesbank, which 
were published in April 2022.20 These con-
cern both the outlook for the macroeco-
nomic environment21 and the impact of en-
ergy rationing.22 Because the current ad-
verse scenario has a later starting point and 
accounts for seasonal patterns in the sup-
ply of gas, the impact of quantitative losses 
in gas supplies on economic activity shifts 
into the coming year. That is when the 
dampening effect of higher commodity 
prices and weaker foreign trade come into play as well. As things currently stand, this 
explains why the stress factors under the 
adverse scenario will only hit the German 
economy with full force from 2023 on-
wards.
Overall, the estimates of the macroeco-
nomic repercussions of the adverse scenario 
are subject to considerable uncertainty.23 In 
20 In the April 2022 edition of the Monthly Report, 
the scenario had been projected to start at the end of 
the fi  rst quarter of 2022; see Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2022g). In the current calculations, the starting date 
has been shifted to the beginning of the second half of 
the year. For this reason, the impact on the inter-
national environment and the German economy will 
be smaller in the current year.
21 The increase in energy commodity prices is now 
smaller relative to the baseline scenario. In part, the in-
creases in commodity prices assumed in the earlier cal-
culations are now contained in the baseline scenario. 
Furthermore, the impulse from commodity prices will 
weaken to a greater extent in the fi  nal year of the pro-
jection horizon, partly because a more signifi  cant year- 
on- year decline is now assumed for the year 2024. The 
assumed impact of the scenario on German foreign 
demand is of a similar magnitude as before (with the 
exception of the current year). This also applies to the 
effects on food prices and foreign competitors’ prices. 
The uncertainty effects shift more strongly into later 
years. The fi  scal measures that had previously been in-
cluded and further measures that have been adopted 
in the meantime by the Federal Government (in the 
area of armaments and to provide relief from increased 
energy costs) are now already included in the baseline 
scenario (see p. 19 f.) and thus no longer form part of 
the adverse scenario.
22 Compared with the earlier calculations, the gas 
gap, amongst other things, has been calculated with 
greater granularity in terms of savings opportunities 
and expansion of supplies and a quarterly rationing 
profi  le was modelled. As the delivery stoppage is as-
sumed to start later, the natural gas reservoirs will now 
fi  ll up over the second and third quarters of 2022, 
which means that the gas supply bottleneck will ma-
terialise later. The calibration of the shock has been ad-
justed such that the unprotected sectors are directly 
exposed to the shock in accordance with their (rela-
tive) gas intensity. By contrast, gas deliveries to energy 
suppliers are now hardly affected by rationing owing 
to substitutes or prioritisation. Lastly, behavioural ad-
justments by different consumer groups in response to 
higher gas prices and the like have been explicitly 
taken into account when determining the gas gap. In 
addition, these adjustments increase over time. For this 
reason, the present calculations assume full additivity, 
over the entire analysis period, of the GDP losses that 
can be attributed to quantitative restrictions according 
to the input- output model with those resulting from 
higher gas prices according to the BbkM- DE model.

particular, the calculations concerning the 
spillover effects of missing gas supplies 
through the supply chains of the German 
economy can only roughly account for the 
complexity of sectoral interlinkages. The ef-
fects on real GDP may be both higher and 
lower than those shown here.24 As far as 
the infl  ation rate is concerned, the upside 
risk predominates. Thus, given the high in-
fl  ation rates that continue to be expected, it 
is also possible that increased production 
costs will be passed through to consumer 
prices to a greater extent.25 Moreover, the 
risk of the high infl  ation becoming en-
trenched via stronger second- round effects 
is greater still in the adverse scenario (see 
the relevant section on the risk assessment 
on pp. 42 f.).
24 A greater availability of substitutes could dampen 
the GDP losses, for example. These include evasive ac-
tion in terms of consumption or behavioural changes 
by households or enterprises that are not modelled in 
BbkM- DE. On the other hand, the gains in price com-
petitiveness may be overstated in as far as the increase 
in foreign competitors’ prices is the result of higher 
sales prices of energy- exporting trading partners. This 
is because German exporters do not compete in the 
energy market, but export other goods. Uncertainty 
also exists in terms of the rationing effects, in particu-
lar with regard to the potential scope available to dif-
ferent consumer groups to make savings, the timing 
and scale of the expansion of supply and the degree to 
which effects are amplifi  ed via supply chains.
25 Current infl  ation fi  gures suggest that pass- through 
in terms of gas consumer prices has happened more 
quickly in recent months than was the case in the sam-
ple period underlying the model estimates. Accord-
ingly, the gas price effects reported here could shift 
forward in time. Furthermore, a price adjustment 
clause in the recently adopted amendment to the Ger-
man Energy Security Act (Energiesicherungsgesetz) 
allows energy suppliers to already pass on price in-
creases to their customers at the alert level of the 
Emergency Plan for Gas at short notice and irrespect-
ive of the contractual situation.Comparison of baseline and adverse

ergy exports, energy prices would be driven up 
markedly again (see the box on pp. 35ff.). Not 
only oil and gas prices themselves would then 
pick up. On top of this, the shortages could 
lead to cost mark- ups in other areas, similar to 
what has been recently observed. Additional 
supply problems – for example due to the pan -
demic intensifying in Asia – could also lead to 
increased pressure on prices.33 Lastly, the costs 
of the German economy transitioning to cli -
mate neutrality could be even higher than as -
sumed in the projection.
The large number of cost increases that firms 
are exposed to is likely to increase the likeli -
hood that these costs will be passed on to con -
sumers more quickly and on a greater scale 
than in the past. An increased pass- through of 
costs of this kind was assumed in the projec -
tion only to a very limited extent, not least be -
cause assumptions in this regard are also sub -
ject to a high degree of uncertainty.34 Accord -
ingly, this represents an upside risk. Longer-  
term inflation expectations remained at around 
2% recently and were thus higher than the 
average of the past ten years. If these expect -
ations continue to rise, they could influence 
firms’ pricing behaviour in that they increase 
their prices today in anticipation of higher infla -
tion. This could contribute to a longer- lasting 
period of high inflation. Similar second- round 
effects could also occur in the form of stronger 
wage growth. Thus far, this channel has not 
played a major role in Germany, and the pro -
jection also only factors in a small degree of 
amplification effects via wages. Nevertheless, 
persistently high inflation rates and increased 
inflation expectations could lead to higher 
wage demands across the board and increas -
ingly to stronger negotiated wage rises that ex -
tend beyond the level anticipated in the projec -
tion. Should firms subsequently adjust their Persistently high

elevated over a longer horizon. If monetary 
policy is consequently tightened to a greater extent than assumed in the projections, eco -

nificantly.

Pension insurance scheme:  
long- term scenarios and reform options
Demographic developments will put the finances of the statutory pension insurance scheme 
under pressure in future. The Federal Government intends to permanently keep the replacement 
rate at its current level of 48% after 2025. It would then remain significantly higher than under 
the legal status quo. As a result, the contribution rate and the required tax- financed government 
funds would rise considerably more strongly than previously envisaged.
The level of the replacement rate and the distribution of financial burdens must be considered and deter -
mined at the political level. In view of all the uncertainty involved, however, it would be prudent to pre -
sent the relevant long- term financial effects transparently. This article updates the Bundesbank’s long-  
term simulations from 2019. These are not point forecasts, but they depict relationships and illustrate 
pension approaches. The simulations start in 2026, i.e. after the expiration of the current transitional 
arrangements, meaning that they do not focus on the current situation of very high inflation rates.
In the first instance, the simulations depict the legal status quo and compare this with the gov -
ernment’s plans (keeping the replacement rate stable at 48%). In both scenarios, the retirement 
age remains unchanged at 67 years from the 2030s onwards. Compared with the legal status 
quo, the contribution rate is significantly higher given a replacement rate of 48%, and rises to 
29% by 2070. The government funds needed also rise much more steeply, and the federal budget 
comes under considerably increased pressure.
The article goes on to illustrate two reform options based on the approaches used in many other 
European countries. The first option, like the government plans, guarantees a fixed replacement 
rate, but only upon retirement. In the subsequent pension- drawing period, pensions rise in line 
with inflation. Purchasing power is thus maintained. However, the replacement rate will probably 
decline markedly over the course of the pension- drawing period, as pensions are likely to rise 
more slowly than wages. The repercussions for insured persons and pension finances are heavily 
dependent upon how the reform is structured in concrete terms and how real wages develop over 
the long term. If the replacement rate is set at 48% upon retirement, pension benefits, the contri -
bution rate and federal government funds are lower than in the government plans. A slightly 
higher starting value reduces the difference. Insured persons who live longer are thus harder- hit 
overall by lower pension payments compared with the government plans. On average, however, 
they also have higher incomes. Such distributional aspects should ultimately be assessed at the 
political level. A disadvantage of this option is that the longer- term financial development of the 
pension insurance scheme is less predictable, as it additionally depends on how real wages evolve.
The second reform option ties the statutory retirement age to increasing life expectancy. This prevents 
the number of pension- drawing years from rising more steeply than the number of contribution years. 
In the simulation, this ratio remains at roughly the level reached at the beginning of the 2030s from 
that point onwards. On the basis of current estimates, the retirement age is set to rise to just over 69 
years by 2070. Creating this link markedly eases the pressure on the contribution rate and the federal 
budget. A longer period of employment would see both individual pension benefits and employment 
rise. This would increase economic output and tax revenue. On the whole, it appears clear why a num -
ber of national and international advisory bodies recommend such an approach in Germany’s case.Deutsche Bundesbank

Demographic developments 
will put pressure on pension 
funding
Demographic developments will put the 
finances of the statutory pension insurance 
scheme under pressure in future.1 First, an in -
creasing number of baby boomers will be 
reaching retirement age by the mid-  2030s. 
Second, life expectancy is likely to increase fur -
ther.2 The pension insurance scheme must base 
itself on the variables in order to remain finan -
cially stable. These include, in particular, the 
(standardised) replacement rate,3 the statutory 
retirement age, the contribution rate and the 
tax- financed funds transferred by central gov -
ernment (government funds).
Up to and including 2025, the contribution rate 
and replacement rate are subject to thresholds. 
The contribution rate, which currently stands at 
18.6%, may not exceed 20%. Meanwhile, the 
replacement rate cannot fall below 48%. As it 
is already at 48%, pensions up to 2025 will in -
crease in parallel with wages (after deduction 
of social security contributions and before 
taxes). The retirement age will initially continue 
to rise.
As from 2026, according to current law, there 
will once again be a more varied mix of adjust -
ments in the variables: first, the replacement 
rate will decline, meaning that pensions will 
grow more slowly than wages.4 Second, the 
contribution rate will increase. Third, govern -
ment funds will increase more strongly as they 
are tied to the rising contribution rate. And, 
fourth, the statutory retirement age is set to 
rise – but only up to the start of the 2030s, by 
which time it will have reached 67 years.
The Federal Government plans to stabilise the 
replacement rate over the long term, i.e. also 
after 2025, at 48%.5 The burden would then 
shift more to contribution payers, to whom the 
bulk of tax revenue is also attributable. On bal -
ance, the contribution rate and tax- financed 
government funds would rise significantly more strongly than in the current legal situation. 
Central government would subsequently have 
to make savings elsewhere or substantially raise 
taxes. At present, there are no plans to increase 
the retirement age any further after 2031. The 
Federal Government has ruled this out for the 
current legislative period.6Demographic

and, in particular, its longer- term outlook at irregular inter -

2 The assumptions made for life expectancy are based on 
the 14th coordinated population projection by the Federal 
Statistical Office (see Federal Statistical Office (2019)). 
Meanwhile, the Federal Statistical Office has released up -
dated projections for the medium term up to 2035 (see 
Federal Statistical Office (2021)). These take into account, 
first and foremost, actual developments up to the current 
end. This means that the development of life expectancy is 
slightly lower than previously assumed. For the period up 
to 2035, the Federal Statistical Office now assumes that life 
expectancy at birth will rise slightly less steeply than in pre -
vious projections. Remaining life expectancy from the age 
of 67 is hardly affected by the revisions up to 2070.
3 Definitions of important terms used in the discussion on 
pensions can be found in Deutsche Bundesbank (2019), 
pp. 55-56. The replacement rate (pension level after social 
security contributions but before tax) reflects the ratio of 
the standard pension to average earnings subject to com -
pulsory insurance. The standard pension is calculated from 
45 years of contributions at an average wage. The replace -
ment rate calculated in this manner currently amounts to 
just over 48%. The standard pension is, therefore, just un -
der half as high as the average earnings of all employees 
subject to pension insurance contributions (after deduction 
of social security contributions). This means that it bears no 
relation to final individual income. The post- tax replace -
ment rate (excluding any other income and child benefit 
claims) is likely to be markedly higher; see Deutsche Bun -
desbank (2019), p. 56.
4 This is due, in particular, to the sustainability factor in the 
pension adjustment formula, according to which pensions 
grow less strongly than wages (before tax but after deduc -
tion of social security contributions) if the ratio of pension 
recipients to contribution payers increases. A detailed de -
scription of this formula can be found in Deutsche Bundes -
bank (2019), p. 56.
5 See SPD, Bündnis 90/ Die Grünen and FDP (2021).
6 According to the coalition agreement, the Federal Gov -
ernment plans to build up a capital stock in the statutory 
pension insurance scheme. This should help to cushion the 
rise in the contribution rate. However, this plan has not yet 
been specified in more detail. The sum of €10 billion re -
ferred to in the agreement is insufficient to achieve quanti -
tatively significant effects.Deutsche Bundesbank

International trends: 
 pensions frequently indexed 
to prices and retirement age 
linked to life expectancy
Many countries face demographic challenges 
comparable to those in Germany. A fundamen -
tally wage- oriented pension adjustment after 
entry into retirement (as is planned in Germany) 
is uncommon in other places.7 Most other Eu -
ropean and OECD countries index pensions to 
prices, at least in part. Pure price indexation is 
used in Austria, for example. Compared with 
wage adjustment, pensions in payment grow 
more slowly with price indexation if wages rise 
more strongly than prices. Such a development 
is common in economies that are growing in 
real terms, and is expected to continue into the 
future. Given price indexation, the individual 
replacement rate, i.e. the pension level in rela -
tion to the average wage of the respective 
year, declines over the course of the pension-  
drawing period.8 This means that, over time, a 
person’s pension rises more slowly than the av -
erage wage (after deduction of social security 
benefits, before tax).
In many EU countries, the statutory retirement 
age is also rising along with life expectancy.9 
This means that not only the pension- drawing 
period but also the contribution period are get -
ting longer, thus significantly reducing the pres -
sure to adjust the other variables. Some of the 
national and international institutions that ad -
vise the Federal Government on matters of 
economic policy recommend that the retire -
ment age be tied to life expectancy.10Long- term development

This article builds on the Bundesbank’s long-

48% planned by the government. It also illus -

the retirement age to life expectancy. The sim -

rate and contribution rate thresholds applicable 
up to 2025 have expired. This longer- term per -

tion, which is characterised, amongst other 
things, by exceptionally high inflation rates.

high degree of uncertainty. The results of the

7 Only Denmark currently offers a one- to- one indexation 
of benefits to wages. Many countries use a mix of price 
and wage indices. The aim is to curb expenditure growth 
and thus mitigate the demographically-  driven financing 
problems in the pay- as- you- go system. See OECD (2021), 
pp. 34-36.
8 A pension adjustment changeover to price indexation 
was recently also discussed by the Board of Academic Ad -
visors at the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and 
Energy  (since renamed the Federal Ministry for Economic 
Affairs and Climate Action) as well as by the Kommission 
Verlässlicher Generationenvertrag (Reliable Intergenera -
tional Contract Commission); see Federal Ministry for Eco -
nomic Affairs and Energy (2021) and Kommission Verlässli -
cher Generationenvertrag (2020).
9 These countries include, amongst others, Denmark, Italy, 
the Netherlands and Portugal; see European Commission 
(2021), p. 56. A similar system is one in which the retire -
ment age is flexible and deductions and add- ons at the 
time of entry into retirement are tied to rising life expec -
tancy.
10 This is recommended by both international organisa -
tions (including the International Monetary Fund (2019) 
and the OECD (2020)) and national organisations (Board of 
Academic Advisors at the Federal Ministry for Economic Af -

casts. The options for pension approaches pre -
sented here do not constitute calls or recom -
mendations for action. Rather, the simulations 
are intended to reveal important trends in the 
development of the individual variables and the 
relationships between them. Other approaches 
are conceivable, such as a different adjustment 
of the retirement age to life expectancy or a 
mixed indexation of pensions to wages and 
prices. Ultimately, it is up to policymakers to 
decide how they wish to split the demographic 
burden between the contribution rate, govern -
ment funds and pensions. However, using 
long- term projections, they should elucidate the impact of the planned reform from today’s 
perspective under plausible assumptions.11
Longer- term outlook: current 
legal situation and govern -
ment plans for a permanent 
replacement rate of 48%
Baseline scenario: the legal status quo12
In 2025, the thresholds for the replacement 
rate (48%) and the contribution rate (20%) will 
expire. Without follow- up rules, demographic 
burdens will again be more broadly distributed 
among the variables from 2026 onwards (see 
the adjacent chart). In this baseline scenario, 
the replacement rate falls. However, nominal 
pensions continue to rise. The baseline scenario 
simulations produce a replacement rate of 43% 
at the end of the 2030s, while the figure for 
2070 is 40½%.13 The contribution rate in -
creases to 23% by the end of the 2030s. In 
2070, it reaches 25%. Government funds in re -
lation to value added also increase significantly, 
as they are largely linked to the contribution 
rate. Up to 2070, government funds in relation 
to value added will increase by 1½ percentage 
points from 2021. By way of comparison, this 
corresponds to the revenue from 4 percentage

11 In its annual pension insurance report, the Federal Gov -
ernment only considers the next 14 years. The most recent 
report, published in November 2021, looks forward as far 
as 2035; see Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs 
(2021). The Board of Academic Advisors at the Federal Min -
istry for Economic Affairs and Energy, by contrast, has pub -
lished forecasts extending to the year 2060; see Federal 
Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (2021). The calcu -

simulations; see, inter alia, Börsch-  Supan and Rausch 
(2021), Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy 
(2021) and Werding (2021).
13 At the same time, legislators use tax funds to boost 
funded supplementary pension plans at the individual level 
(e.g. the “Riester” pension). The aim is for supplementary 
funded private pension provision to cushion the planned 
lower replacement rates under the statutory pension insur -
ance scheme; for earlier Bundesbank calculations, see

points of the standard VAT rate from today’s 
perspective.14
Government plans: permanent 48% 
 replacement rate
The Federal Government plans to stabilise the 
replacement rate at 48% on a permanent ba -
sis. Pensions will then continue to rise in line 
with wages after 2025.15 The simulations show 
that the contribution rate and government 
funds will increase steeply in this scenario. The 
contribution rate in 2070 is set to stand at 29% 
(+4 percentage points compared with the base -
line scenario). In relation to value added, the 
government funds tied to the contribution rate 
are around 1 percentage point higher than in 
the baseline scenario and 2½  percentage 
points higher than in 2021. To finance the total 
increase, it would then be necessary to gener -
ate revenue from a standard rate of VAT that is 
6 percentage points higher overall in 2070, for 
example. The federal budget would then come 
under significant pressure. It would thus be 
prudent to at least consider other pension sys -
tem approaches that are widely used interna -
tionally.
Reform option: after retire -
ment, pensions grow in line 
with the inflation rate
Initial replacement rate guaranteed, 
 compensation for price increases during 
pension- drawing period
In Germany, pension entitlements before and 
after retirement are indexed using the same 
pension adjustment factor. This means that the 
replacement rate for a person entering retire -
ment is identical to that of individuals already 
drawing pensions (for equivalent pension con -
tributions in the past).16 One option for reform 
would be to allow a person’s pension to rise 
more slowly in the pension- drawing period af -
ter they have entered retirement. Even so, the 
replacement rate upon retirement would re -main stable. This is the case, for example, in 
schemes where pensions in payment are in -
dexed to inflation, an approach adopted in 
many other countries. Compared with wage in -
dexation (i.e. stable replacement rate upon re -
tirement and during the pension- drawing pe -
riod), price indexation, in and of itself, relieves 
adjustment pressure on pension funding: the 
contribution rate and government funds re -
quired increase more slowly. Hybrid formats are 
also conceivable, though: these would entail 
pensions growing after retirement in line with 
an index that includes both price and wage de -
velopments. The effects would then lie be -
tween those of either pure wage or pure price 
indexation. In order to illustrate these effects 
more clearly, this article explores a changeover 
to pure price indexation. The simulations also 
switch all pensions in payment over to the new 
system.17
In the simulations, pensions increase in line 
with changes in prices during the pension-  
drawing phase. These changes are measured 
by growth in the consumer price index. As a re -
sult, price increases during the pension- drawing 
period do not diminish pensions’ purchasing Replacement

funds rise even

14 The ratio to value added is harder to capture. A com -
parison to VAT makes it possible to illustrate relative mag -
nitudes of the effects of individual measures; see Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2019).
15 Rising or falling social security contribution rates (with 
the exception of health insurance contributions, of which 
pension recipients and employed persons have to pay half) 
influence the replacement rate. This is due to the fact that 
pension recipients, for example, pay their full contribution 
to the long- term care insurance scheme on their own. The 
level of standard pension available as well as the replace -
ment rate decline when this contribution rate increases.
16 The increasing taxation of pensions is not reflected in 
the replacement rate.
17 This should not be interpreted as a recommendation for 
action. If political consideration were to be given to a 
changeover, this could take a number of forms. Amongst 
other things, a decision would need to be made on how 
the pensions of individuals already in retirement at the end 
of 2025 would be transferred to the new system. Depend -
ing on how it is designed, this would have different finan -
cial implications for the statutory pension insurance 
scheme.Deutsche Bundesbank

power.18 However, the ratio of an individual’s 
pension to the current average wage of em -
ployees decreases as the period over which 
pensions are paid increases in length. This is 
because (per capita) wages can be expected to 
continue rising more strongly than prices on 
average in the future. They generally depend 
on labour productivity growth plus price in -
creases.
The following simulations show the effects of 
switching to inflation indexation from 2026 on -
wards.19 The year 2026 is a logical choice be -
cause the rules currently in place will expire be -
forehand and the Federal Government is devis -
ing new ones. The simulations are based on 
the following annual assumptions, which are 
comparable to those used in other studies:
– In line with the Eurosystem’s target, trend 
inflation is set at 2%.20 In an inflation-  
indexed system, pensions will thus grow by 
an average of 2% per year. In recent years, 
inflation rates were lower than this target. 
At present, though, exceptionally high rates 
are being observed. Inflation rates may devi -
ate temporarily from the Eurosystem’s infla -
tion target. The longer term is what is im -
portant here, though: in principle, it is as -
sumed that values above and below the tar -
get will offset each other over the long term 
and that the European Central Bank will 
achieve the inflation target on average.
– Average wages will see trend growth of 3% 
(gross, i.e. before deducting social security 
contributions and taxes). The increase would 
be broadly compatible with the above-  
mentioned price increase of 2% and trend 
labour productivity growth of 1%. Other 
long- term estimates are based on similar val -
ues.21 Together with employment, wages 
determine the level of contribution receipts 
collected by the statutory pension insurance 
scheme.
Assumptions of this nature are often subject to 
some uncertainty. If what actually occurs devi -ates from what has been assumed, the way in 
which pensions, the contribution rate and gov -
ernment funds will develop could differ signifi -
cantly. Generally speaking, a more favourable 
development of real wages for contribution 
payers and taxpayers leads to lower replace -
ment rates for pension recipients, and vice 
versa. Possible concrete effects and responses 
to them will be discussed below.
Outlook for single retirement cohorts
The chart on p. 53 shows the effect that infla -
tion indexation of this nature has under the as -
sumptions made. It illustrates the impact on 
the individual replacement rate during the 
pension- drawing period for various retirement 
cohorts (from 2026).22 The initial replacement 
rate is an important parameter, and the level at 
which it is set is ultimately a political decision. 
For example, after 2025, the minimum thresh -
old of 48% could serve as the starting value.

Inflation indexa -
tion: replace -
ment rate falls 
over pension- 
drawing period
18 Rising social security contributions and taxes reduce 
pensions’ purchasing power, however. In the simulations, 
the contribution rate to the statutory pension insurance 
scheme increases. This lowers average disposable earnings. 
The replacement rate (pension in relation to wages after 
contributions) is then higher. As a result of this effect, the 
replacement rate is not linear during the pension- drawing 
period (see the chart on p. 53). What is not taken into ac -
count is the likely countereffect stemming from the contri -
bution rates for long- term care insurance. If these rise as 
expected, a heavier burden will be placed on pension recip -
ients, as they pay the full contribution on their own. The re -
placement rate will then fall somewhat more sharply.
19 The simulations are performed using the Bundesbank’s 
overlapping generations (OLG) model. For more informa -
tion, see Schön (2020). The model has been updated and 
factors in actual developments up to the present.
20 This corresponds (by chance) to the average pension in -
creases expected between 2026 and 2035 under current 
law, as per the Federal Government’s latest pension insur -
ance report. See Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Af -
fairs (2021).
21 In the pension insurance report, the Federal Govern -
ment also assumes wage growth of 3% in the longer term 
and productivity growth of 1%; see Federal Ministry of La -
bour and Social Affairs (2021). In the latest report of the 
European Commission’s Ageing Working Group, higher la -
bour productivity growth of 1.4% is assumed for Germany 
in the longer term; see European Commission (2021).
22 The simulations for inflation indexation assume that re -
tirement commences on 1 July of a given year. The first ad -
justment then takes place 12 months later on 1 July of the 
following year. For a discussion of the transition for individ -
uals who are already in retirement at the time of the 
changeover, see the later sections of this article.Deutsche Bundesbank

rate decreases because the average wage in -
creases more strongly than pensions adjusted 
for inflation. However, the real value of the 
pension does not change. On average, the re -
placement rate is just under 44% over an aver -
age pension- drawing period. This is markedly 
higher than in the baseline scenario under cur -
rent law, especially for those entering retire -
ment from 2035 onwards. However, individual 
replacement rates are then lower at the end of 
the pension- drawing period than the replace -
ment rates in the baseline scenario.23
The initial rate can also be set higher or lower. 
The above chart additionally shows the effects 
of a second simulation with an initial rate of 
50%, run to serve as an example.24 Compared 
with the baseline scenario, individual pensions 
are higher for all future generations under the 
simulated reform, both upon retirement and 
over the course of retirement (given an average 
life expectancy). At just under 46%, the aver -
age replacement rate for pension recipients is then higher across the entire pension-  drawing 
period. Individual replacement rates at the end 
of an average pension- drawing period are 
lower than in the baseline scenario for those 
who retire before 2040, but not significantly 
so. For those who enter retirement from 2040 
onwards, the rates are higher over the entire 
period of pension payment modelled.
How does inflation indexation at an initial re -
placement rate of 50% compare with the gov -
ernment plans to keep the replacement rate 
constant at 48%? The individual replacement 
rate is higher in the first five years after enter -
ing retirement. This is because inflation indexa -
tion starts from a higher level (50%). However, 
the rate then falls below 48% over the remain -Given initial rate

* Standard pension relative to average wage pursuant to Annex 1 of the Sixth Book of the Social Security Code. A person making aver-
age contribution payments receives a standard pension after retiring at the statutory retirement age after 45 years. At the start of the 
pension-drawing period, the pension to wage ratio is 48% or 50% respectively. Over the course of the pension-drawing period, it de-
clines as shown by the dashed lines. This decline results from the fact that a person's pension rises in line with inflation rather than with 
the more rapidly increasing average wage. The dots show the average replacement rate of an average pension-drawing period.

der of the pension- drawing period. The re -
placement rate is also lower on average over 
the pension- drawing period than it would be 
under the government plans. In this respect, 
the simulated reform falls somewhere between 
the government plans (with the replacement 
rate fixed at 48%) and the baseline scenario. 
This therefore results in lower burdens for con -
tribution payers and taxpayers than under the 
government plans and higher burdens than in 
the baseline scenario (see below).
Outlook for the pension insurance scheme, 
for contribution payers and taxpayers
In the first simulation of inflation indexation, 
the initial replacement rate is 48%. Conse -
quently, pension expenditure is significantly 
lower than under the government plans to 
maintain a stable replacement rate upon retire -
ment and during the pension- drawing period. 
The contribution rate will still rise significantly 
to 26½% by 2070 (see the chart above). How -ever, this is just over 2½  percentage points 
lower than under the government plans. The 
government funds required also grow by a 
lesser amount, though by 2070 they will have 
still increased by just under 2 percentage points 
of value added. From today’s perspective, this 
corresponds to the revenue from almost 5 per -
centage points of the standard VAT rate. This 
would be 1½ percentage points less than un -
der the government plans. Still, compared with 
the baseline scenario, the contribution rate and 
government funds needed are considerably 
higher.
In the scenario with an elevated initial replace -
ment rate of 50%, pensions in payment also 
jump from 48% to 50% at the time of the 
changeover in 2026. In this scenario, pension 
expenditure rises markedly at first. This explains 
why the contribution rate and government 
funds increase more sharply for a time (see the 
adjacent chart). In the longer term, however, 
the financial burdens in this scenario likewise 
lie somewhere between the baseline scenario 
and the government plans. Compared with the 
government plans, the contribution rate is 
1½ percentage points lower in 2070 following 
a markedly faster increase up to the mid- 2030s. 
In 2070, however, it is still 2½  percentage 
points higher than in the baseline scenario. By 
2070, government funds will have increased by 
2 percentage points (corresponding to revenue 
from just over 5  percentage points of the 
standard VAT rate).
Selected other aspects of inflation 
 indexation
Stabilisation of purchasing power versus wage 
orientation from the perspective of persons 
covered by the pension insurance scheme
When pensions are indexed to inflation, they 
are decoupled from wage developments in the 
pension- drawing period. As a result, pensions 
in payment are no longer tied to productivity 
growth and associated increases in prosperity.

pension- drawing period differs according to 
growth in real wages. If real wages record 
trend growth of only 0.6% per year instead of 
the 1% assumed in the simulations, the re -
placement rate will be on average just over 
1½ percentage points higher following an av -
erage pension- drawing period (year of retire -
ment: 2026). By contrast, if they increase by 
1.4%, the rate will be just over 1½ percentage 
points lower.
The declining replacement rate during the 
pension- drawing period and the uncertainty 
surrounding this could hamper the acceptance 
of such a reform. A higher initial replacement 
rate could mitigate these effects. However, the 
contribution rate and the government funds re -
quired will then be higher. With regard to a de -
clining replacement rate during the pension-  
drawing period, however, it should be borne in 
mind that, in the baseline scenario (the legal 
status quo), the replacement rate applicable 
upon retirement decreases over time anyway.
Stabilisation of purchasing power versus wage 
orientation from the perspective of the 
 pension insurance scheme
The financial situation of the pension insurance 
scheme does not currently depend on the scale 
of real wage increases. While higher real wage 
increases – for example, due to higher produc -
tivity – increase revenue, this is offset by higher 
spending on pensions. By contrast, when 
switching to inflation indexation, real wage de -
velopments play a role in pension funding. In 
line with other long- term calculations, the sim -
ulations assume an annual trend increase in 
real wages of 1%. However, this assumption is 
subject to some uncertainty:
– Real wages could rise more strongly than as -
sumed. For example, digitalisation could in -
crease the demands made of employees. If 
this increases the level of qualification in the 
workforce on average, labour productivity 
growth will increase.– Real wages could rise more slowly than as -
sumed, as, for instance, setbacks in the in -
ternational division of labour and climate-  
friendly production changes could dampen 
real wage growth.
In this respect, the long- term outlook for pen -
sion funding is less predictable when pensions 
are indexed to inflation. For example, if growth 
in real wages is 0.4 percentage point stronger 
than assumed, the contribution rate will be 
around 1 percentage point lower in 2070. The 
same applies, with the inverse sign, given a 
weaker rise in real wages. As things currently 
stand, real wages are not expected to see zero 
growth over a longer period (with wages then 
only rising in line with the inflation rate). How -
ever, if they were not to increase in the long 
term, the replacement rate would actually rise 
throughout the pension- drawing period as a 
whole. This is due to rising pension contribu -
tion rates. In the case of inflation indexation, 
these only place a burden on the contribution 
payers. Due to the fact that, taken in isolation, 
this lowers average disposable earnings, the re -
placement rate rises. On balance, then, the 
burden on contribution payers and taxpayers is 
even higher than at a constant replacement 
rate of 48%.
Inflation indexation from a monetary policy 
perspective
From a monetary policy perspective, broadly 
automatic price indexation mechanisms are 
generally problematic. Under certain circum -
stances, many people may then begin to lose 
interest in stable prices, raising the spectre of 
inflation expectations becoming de- anchored. 
Rising inflation would be more likely. For exam -
ple, price- indexed rents increase inflation, as -
suming they are included in the price index. In 
the case of wages, indexation could lead to 
second-  round effects that reinforce the infla -
tionary process. Neither is the case when 
switching to price indexation of pensions in 
payment. Pensions impact aggregate demand, 
and indexation to inflation could thus have a Higher initial 
replacement 
rate could partly 
compensate for 
falling replace -
ment rate over 
course of 
retirement

procyclical effect. On the other hand, inflation 
indexation replaces an existing wage indexa -
tion mechanism, which is generally likely to 
have a more procyclical effect than price index -
ation. A changeover from wage indexation to 
price indexation for pensions therefore appears 
to give little cause for concern from a monetary 
policy perspective and is viewed as unproblem -
atic in other countries as well.
Inflation indexation and effects given 
 heterogeneity in life expectancies
As a general rule, inflation indexation changes 
the way in which funds from the statutory 
pension insurance scheme are distributed 
throughout a cohort’s retirement: based on a 
stable initial replacement rate upon retirement, 
the rate decreases continually during the 
pension- drawing period. This means that, un -
like under the status quo, the replacement rate 
averaged over the entire pension- drawing pe -
riod becomes lower the longer a person lives. 
The average replacement rate over the retire -
ment period as a whole also falls, by around 
1∕5 percentage point per additional year of re -
tirement.
Empirical studies show a correlation between 
remaining life expectancy and income.25 It is 
therefore individuals who tend to have higher 
incomes (and live longer) who bear a compara -
tively higher burden in the event of a changeo -
ver to inflation indexation.26 Regardless of 
these general observations, there are, of 
course, also people with long life expectancies 
who receive a low statutory pension and do 
not have any other old- age income (not even 
in the same household). Although the purchas -
ing power of their pensions is preserved, the 
replacement rate declines. These individuals 
therefore tend to reach or fall below poverty 
thresholds during the pension- drawing period. 
This is because these thresholds increase in line 
with real wages – at least in part.27 In Germany, 
if household income and wealth drop below 
certain thresholds, support is then provided in the form of a means- tested basic allowance for 
the elderly.28
Indexing retirement age to life 
expectancy
Combination of baseline scenario and 
 government plans
Rising life expectancy will gradually put more 
pressure on the pension insurance scheme if 
the statutory retirement age remains un -
changed as from 2031. The following simula -
tions are based on earlier Bundesbank calcula -
tions concerning the retirement age.29 They as -
sume that after 2031, the retirement age will 
go up such that the average ratio of years in re -
tirement to years of contributions remains at 
around the level reached in 2031 – just over 
40%.30 Based on the underlying assumptions Average replace -

period becomes

longer (typically 
higher earners) 
bear more costs 
of changeover, 
relativelySystematically 
link retirement 
age to life 
expectancy
25 Lampert et al. (2019) and Haan and Schaller (2021) con -
clude that remaining life expectancy for people over 65 is 
significantly shorter for those with low incomes than for 
those with high incomes.
26 Compared to wage indexation, inflation indexation 
eases the overall burden on pension funding if individuals 
with higher pensions (more earnings points) draw a pen -
sion for longer. Inflation indexation means that when pen -
sions are drawn over a longer period, the average replace -
ment rate decreases, which then disproportionately affects 
those with higher pensions. This effect, which tends to 
dampen the contribution rate, is not taken into account in 
the simulations because they do not include households 
with heterogeneous incomes.
27 Börsch-  Supan and Rausch (2021) show that, at an initial 
replacement rate of 48% and a pension of 80% of the 
standard pension, the poverty threshold might be under -
shot after a pension- drawing period of 20 years. The calcu -
lations assume annual productivity growth of 1.2%. As a 
result, the replacement rates fall more sharply during the 
pension- drawing period than in the simulations carried out 
for this article.
28 On average, women have longer life expectancies than 
men. In this regard, their retirement periods are longer. 
Switching to inflation indexation would therefore place a 
heavier burden on them, as described for longer life expec -
tancies. This will be the case as long as life expectancy for 
women and men does not fully converge in the future.
29 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2019). Here, the higher re -
tirement age was only combined with the legal status quo. 
A simulation for a higher retirement age with a threshold 
of 48% is not included.
30 This relative pension- drawing period represents the ra -
tio between a standardised period of pension payment (re -
maining life expectancy as from the statutory retirement 
age) and a standardised period of employment. The period 
of employment is assumed to start at 20 years of age and 
last until the statutory retirement age.Deutsche Bundesbank

regarding life expectancy, the statutory retire -
ment age then rises to just over 69 by 2070.31 
If, for example, life expectancy were to increase 
more slowly, the retirement age would auto -
matically be raised less sharply. As is already the 
case today, not everyone will be able to work 
up to the statutory retirement age. It is there -
fore important to provide a safety net in the 
form of the reduced earnings capacity pension, 
which has also been expanded markedly of 
late.
The simulations up to 2070 show that the pres -
sure on pension funding eases noticeably if the 
retirement age continues to rise gradually after 
2031 (see the adjacent chart). Although the 
contribution rate and government funds still 
undergo a considerable increase, they rise less 
sharply over the long term than they would if 
the retirement age were to remain the same. 
At a threshold of 48% after 45 years of contri -
butions, the contribution rate for 2070 is 2 per -
centage points lower, at 27%. Demographic 
developments also place less strain on the 
budgets of the various levels of government 
because tax revenue rises off the back of the 
longer period of employment. Moreover, the 
necessary tax- financed government funds are 
lower than if the retirement age were to re -
main unchanged. Although their ratio to value 
added increases by 2 percentage points com -
pared with 2021 (just under 5  percentage 
points of the standard VAT rate), in terms of 
value added, this is ½  percentage point less 
than if the retirement age remains unaltered.32
Dynamically adjusted replacement rate 
 noticeably higher when retirement age 
is raised
The previously discussed standardised replace -
ment rates following 45 years of contributions 
fail to take into account that the number of 
contribution years tends to increase in line with 
the rising retirement age. The retirement age 
has risen gradually since 2012 – since then, it 
has been observed that, on average, people 
are also entering retirement progressively later.33 Longer periods of employment thus 
mean that pension entitlements also grow. This 
is also to be expected if the retirement age 
continues to rise after 2031.34 This effect can 
be modelled using a dynamically adjusted re -
placement rate. The dynamically adjusted re -
placement rate takes into account the fact that 
contribution years increase when the retire -
ment age rises. It is then no longer calculated 
on the basis of a constant 45- year contribution 
period. Instead, the contribution years factored 
into the dynamically adjusted replacement rate Higher retire -

32 A combination of inflation indexation and an indexed 
retirement age sees the contribution rate in 2070 reach a 
level of just over 25½% (for an initial level of 50%) and 
24½% (for an initial level of 48%).

utory pension insurance scheme; see Forschungsdatenzen -

are based on the difference between the appli -
cable statutory retirement age and the age of 
20 (assumed entry into the workforce).
The dynamically adjusted replacement rate 
gradually becomes higher over time as the re -
tirement age increases (see the chart above). 
The retirement age is already set to rise to 67 
under current legislation. 2031 will be the first 
year in which people reach the standard retire -
ment age at 67.
For example, the dynamically adjusted replace -
ment rate is correspondingly higher after a 
contribution period of 45 years if the 48% 
threshold is maintained. For a person who re -
tires in 2031 after 47 years of contributions, it 
stands at 50%.35 If the retirement age subse -
quently continues to climb, the dynamically ad -
justed replacement rate comes to just under 
52½% in 2070, after a contribution period of 
just over 49 years.36The political debate has disregarded this issue 
so far. When defining thresholds or stable initial 
replacement rates, it could be worth factoring 
in the additional contribution years – this would 
mean that the replacement rate would be cal -
culated dynamically, thus taking into account 
the growing pension entitlements. At the same 
time, this curbs the rise in the contribution 
rate.37 This applies to any potential raising of 
the retirement age after 2031. However, this 
kind of adjustment could also be examined for 
the period up to 2031, regardless of whether 
the retirement age is raised further.
Conclusion
It is up to policymakers to decide how demo -
graphic burdens should be shared between 
employed persons, taxpayers and pension re -
cipients. They must also take into account the 
effects on growth and employment. After all, 
high levels of employment are a key compo -
nent in easing the demographically- induced 
financial pressure on the pension insurance 
scheme. To enable a comprehensive and well- 
founded debate, it is important that the gov -
ernment uses long- term, plausible projections 
to show how its intended approach affects the 
variables of the pension insurance scheme. 
Given all the estimation uncertainty, there is 
much to suggest that a far longer projection 
horizon should be used than in the current 
pension insurance reports. The calculations 
should also provide guidance for those who 
are presently at the beginning of their working 
life.Dynamically

This article first uses long- term simulations to il -
lustrate the effects arising from the legal status 
quo. Another simulation shows the effect of a 
permanently stable replacement rate of 48% 
after a contribution period of 45 years (govern -
ment plans). In this context, from the 2030s 
onward, the statutory retirement age remains 
unchanged at 67. Under these assumptions, 
the contribution rate rises very sharply from its 
current figure of 18.6% to a level of 29%. The 
contribution rate is thus significantly higher 
than in the legal status quo, in which the re -
placement rate is set to decline. The high con -
tribution rate is in line with projections by other 
institutions. The sharper rise in government 
funds needed also puts the Federal budget un -
der significant financial pressure. However, it 
will probably not be possible to free up these 
additional funds without cutting expenditure 
elsewhere or increasing taxes.
Further simulations illustrate the indexation of 
pensions in payment to inflation – an approach 
used in many other countries. Depending on 
the design of the parameters, it can ease the 
pressure on pension funding. The contribution 
rate and the government funds needed will 
then increase less sharply. Although inflation in -
dexation compensates for price increases dur -
ing the pension- drawing period and purchas -
ing power is thus retained, the replacement 
rate declines continuously during the retire -
ment period as real wages continue to grow. 
Pension recipients who live longer will there -
fore bear a greater share of the burden stem -
ming from such a change. According to empir -
ical studies, these tend to be people with 
higher incomes. Another difference affects the 
predictability of pension funding. Switching to 
inflation indexation would make future finan -
cial developments in pension funding less pre -
dictable than under current legislation because pension funding is also linked to developments 
in real wages. Taken in isolation, heightened 
uncertainty of this kind is one disadvantage to 
inflation indexation.
Many of the institutions that advise the Federal 
Government on matters of economic policy 
recommend that the retirement age be tied to 
life expectancy. Indeed, it would make sense to 
broadly stabilise the relationship between years 
in retirement and years of contributions, say. In 
the scenario simulated for this purpose, the re -
tirement age rises from 67 to just over 69 be -
tween the early 2030s and 2070. This curbs the 
increase in the contribution rate. In 2070, given 
a minimum threshold of 48% for the replace -
ment rate, the contribution rate comes in at 
around 27% (instead of 29% without a higher 
retirement age).
In the past, insured persons gradually shifted 
their actual date of retirement back as the re -
tirement age increased. If insured persons con -
tinue to postpone their retirement in line with 
the statutory retirement age, this will support 
their individual pension. The individual (dynam -
ically adjusted) replacement rate will develop 
more favourably than the recognised replace -
ment rate after 45 years of contributions. If the 
latter is constant at 48%, the dynamically ad -
justed replacement rate will come to 50% in 
2031. When defining thresholds or stable initial 
replacement rates, it could be worth factoring 
in the additional contribution years. This would 
mean that the rate would be calculated dy -
namically. Moreover, longer periods of employ -
ment and rising life expectancy support macro -
economic developments. In this way, they con -
tribute to the successful management of de -
mographic change beyond their role in the 
pension insurance scheme.Permanent

Inflation- induced bracket creep  
in the income tax scale
Income tax is designed to distribute tax burdens according to the ability to pay, which is why it is 
a progressive tax scale – higher nominal incomes are subject to higher average tax rates. When 
prices rise, however, this causes a phenomenon known as inflation- induced bracket creep: the tax 
rate increases in real (price- adjusted) terms. In other words, for a specified tax scale, rising prices 
raise the tax burden on real incomes (i.e. the actual ability to pay). This effect is known as 
inflation- induced bracket creep.
In the past years, reductions in the tax scale had the overall effect of preventing inflation- induced 
bracket creep. Compared with the situation at the end of the 1990s, the tax scale was lowered signifi -
cantly in real terms, too, up to 2005 as a result of sizeable reforms. It increased again after that some -
what in price- adjusted terms. Since 2013, the tax scale has, in principle, been regularly adjusted for the 
expected inflation rate with a one- year time lag. While inflation- induced bracket creep was not always 
perfectly compensated for in every single year as a result of this, it was more or less offset overall.
Last year saw inflation- induced bracket creep significantly exceed the tax relief in 2021 owing to 
the strong rise in prices. The two years before that, however, saw opposing effects materialise 
that were of a similar magnitude overall. Inflation is now back at a very much higher level this 
year. Inflation- induced bracket creep will probably be around €13½ billion in size – far higher 
than the tax relief measures agreed upon to date. This is due to two factors: first, the tax scale is 
normally adjusted with a time lag and, second, inflation dynamics for 2021 were underestimated. 
The coalition parties are currently discussing the extent to which inflation- induced bracket creep 
should continue to be fully compensated for. Based on the approach used hitherto, the income 
tax scale for 2023 would be adjusted for the very high inflation rate from the year 2022.
No matter what specific approach is applied for 2023, it would be obvious, going forward, to estab -
lish a more timely and precise procedure. Under the existing approach, legislators adjust the tax scale 
for inflation with a time lag and determine the adjustment for two years in advance. Instead, every 
autumn they could adjust the tax scale for the coming year based on the government forecast for the 
coming year’s inflation rate. Estimation errors could be offset as part of the next shift in tax brackets. 
Any amendments deviating from this approach would still be possible in the legislative procedure.
As long as fiscal policy generally compensates for inflation-  induced bracket creep by means of 
corresponding reductions in the tax scale, bracket creep does not open up any additional fiscal 
scope. It would therefore be logical for central and state governments to not budget for such rev -
enue in the first place – not even in the medium term. Instead, they should account for the cor -
responding shifts in the tax scale. The extent to which this has already been done so far is not 
always evident from government fiscal planning. Greater transparency is desirable in this regard.
Even if inflation- induced bracket creep is perfectly compensated for, the taxation of income 
should be thoroughly reviewed on a regular basis, not least because aggregate real income 
growth also causes bracket creep. The incentive and distributional effects of income taxation 
overall should therefore be evaluated from time to time.Deutsche Bundesbank

Effects of inflation  
on income taxation
Taxes are the main source of revenue for cen -
tral, state and local government. In 2021, they 
generated revenue equal to one- quarter of 
gross domestic product (GDP). Income tax, the 
most important tax by share, is levied on nom -
inal incomes. Wage tax, which accounts for the 
bulk of income tax, is applied to nominal wages 
and salaries. The income tax scale1 is designed 
to account for taxpayers’ ability to pay, with 
the income needed to cover basic requirements 
remaining tax-  free and income levels above 
that attracting an increasing rate of tax up to a 
top rate of 45%. The income tax scale has a 
progressive design, then, with higher incomes 
being subject to a higher average tax rate.
A combination of a nominal assessment base 
and a progressive tax scale means that rising 
prices result in bracket creep – the tax rate in -
creases in real (price- adjusted) terms. This 
means that for a specified tax scale, steadily ris -
ing prices act like continuous tax increases on 
real incomes. Two examples illustrate this ef -
fect.
– In most cases, nominal wages grow more 
strongly than prices, leaving wage earners 
with a real increase in their wages. Under a 
progressive tax scale, this nominal wage in -
crease results in a higher average tax rate. 
However, the wage increase equal to the 
rate of inflation does not equate to a greater 
ability to pay because that part of the in -
crease is merely compensation for the higher 
prices. As a result, the average tax rate rises 
more strongly on the price- adjusted wage 
than it does on the nominal wage. Bracket 
creep thus ultimately pushes up the average 
tax rate for a specified real wage (real tax 
payment in relation to the real wage), mean -
ing that the tax burden increases even if the 
ability to pay remains unchanged.
– Developments this year have been unique 
insofar as the inflation rate is actually in -creasing significantly beyond nominal wage 
growth. The Bundesbank’s projection indi -
cates that inflation stands at 7%. Average 
nominal wages are growing by just 4%, 
which means that real pre- tax wages are de -
clining. As tax is levied on rising nominal 
wages, the tax burden according to the tax 
scale increases, even though real wages de -
cline. In other words, although the ability to 
pay falls (which would make a lower tax rate 
seem obvious under a progressive tax scale), 
the tax rate goes up.
As price increases weaken the ability to pay, it 
would be logical to account for this when tax -
ing income. If such gradual tax increases in -
duced by bracket creep are to be prevented, 
the tax scale should generally be reduced ac -
cordingly as prices rise.
From a monetary policy perspective, widely 
used automatic price indexation mechanisms 
are generally problematic since they could set 
in motion a self- reinforcing inflation process if 
wages, say, were indexed. Under certain cir -
cumstances, many people may then begin to 
lose interest in stable prices, raising the spectre 
of inflation expectations becoming de-  
anchored. Compensating for inflation- induced 
bracket creep through the tax system, how -
ever, seems fairly unproblematic overall in this 
regard, since this merely prevents an automatic 
real tax rate increase. Adjusted regularly, the 
tax system would, in this sense, be neutral in 
terms of inflation.2 That would also be the case 
under a proportional tax regime, for example.Progressive

1 The income tax scale is a mathematical function that as -
signs a tax payment to each level of income.
2 Inflation- induced bracket creep would weigh particularly 
heavily on real disposable incomes given a high rate of in -
flation. Taken in isolation, this would then dampen aggre -
gate demand and price pressures, potentially contributing 
to stability in the economy as a whole. In this kind of situ -
ation, however, there would be no guarantee that this will 
not be compensated for by fiscal measures elsewhere or 
that government will deploy inflation- induced windfall rev -
enue in other areas under the budgetary rules. Ultimately, 
the central bank possesses the monetary policy instruments 
needed to keep inflation in check.Deutsche Bundesbank

The size of the bracket- creep effect depends on 
the level of inflation. The rate of inflation in 
Germany measured using the consumption de -
flator averaged 1.3% between 1999 and 2021.3 
Price increases were already high in 2021 
(+3.1%) and are likely to reach 6.8% for the 
current year according to the Bundesbank’s lat -
est projection. Price pressures are expected to 
gradually ease again after that, though they 
will remain distinctly above 2% up to and in -
cluding 2024 according to the projection.4
Compensating for inflation- 
induced bracket creep in the 
income tax scale
Wages are the main type of income that is sub -
ject to the income tax scale. In addition, they 
are clustered in the progression zone of the tax 
scale. The specific analysis of the tax scale pre -
sented below will therefore focus on wage tax, 
which means that by far the greatest effect of 
bracket creep will arguably be accounted for.5
Federal Government reporting 
on impact of inflation on the 
tax scale
The rate of inflation has a bearing on adjust -
ments to the income tax scale in two respects. 
First, the Federal Government has been produ -
cing a minimum subsistence report (Existenzmi -Inflation rates 
low on average 
since 1999, but 
prices rising very 
strongly at 
present
Focus on wages 
as a type of 
incomeFiscal drag due to price 
developments for other 
types of tax as well
For other types of tax, too, infl  ation 
changes the tax burden. This is particu-
larly true of volume- based excise duties 
and taxes on interest income. Com-
pared with bracket creep in income tax-
ation, however, these effects are minor.
In the case of volume- based excise du-
ties, infl  ation reduces the burden. En-
ergy tax is a major factor here. A stand-
ard tax rate of 47 cents per litre of diesel 
loses value when prices go up.1 If there 
is infl  ation, the tax burden thus falls over 
time – fi  scal drag is routinely negative in 
this case. Adjustments may therefore be 
necessary over time in order to preserve 
the steering effects of volume- based ex-
cise duties.
In the case of taxation of interest in-
come, infl  ation decouples the burden 
from ability to pay, which is refl  ected in 
the real interest rate. Part of the nominal 
interest income merely compensates for 
the infl  ation- related loss in the value of 
nominal assets. It does not represent in-
creased ability to pay. If nominal interest 
rates are the same, higher infl  ation 
means a lower real interest rate. The 
proportional taxation of nominal inter-
est income causes a higher tax burden 
on the real interest rate, the higher infl  a-
tion is. There may even be an obligation 
to pay if real interest rates are negative.2
1 This is not the case for VAT, which is a propor-
tional tax on value. A fi  xed tax rate is charged on 
the nominal tax base.
2 For more details, see Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2017), pp. 69 ff.3 The deflator of private consumption from the national 
accounts is used here. This is also the instrument used in 
central government’s report on inflation- induced bracket 
creep ( Steuerprogressionsbericht ). The Eurosystem, mean -
while, bases its assessment on the Harmonised Index of 
Consumer Prices (HICP), which is the key measure of price 
stability in the context of European monetary policy. Des -
pite exhibiting certain methodological differences, these 
two price indices have plotted fairly similar paths over a 
long period of time, though inflation rates as measured by 
the private consumption deflator have come in somewhat 
lower in recent years. Thus, the HICP increase over the 
period from 1999 to 2021 stood at 1.5%. According to the 
Bundesbank’s projection, the HICP will rise by 7.1% in 
2022.

which it examines whether the basic income 
tax allowance needs to be raised in accordance 
with the requirements laid down by the Federal 
Constitutional Court in order to keep the min -
imum subsistence level tax- free. The mixed 
price index used therein accounts for develop -
ments in the prices of relevant goods and in 
net wages and salaries.
Second, the Federal Government has had a 
mandate since 2012 to produce a report detail -
ing the effect of inflation-  induced bracket 
creep on the income tax scale.6 In this report, 
the government presents the (expected) 
inflation- induced bracket creep in the income 
tax scale. This report contains proposals for 
shifts in tax brackets (tax cuts) for the coming 
two years. The aim is to offset, with a time lag, 
the gradual tax increases in the current year 
and the year after caused by inflation. These 
proposals are based on the Federal Govern -
ment’s inflation estimate: the estimate for the 
current year is the basis for the tax scale adjust -
ment proposed for the next year, while the in -
flation estimate for the next year underpins the 
recommended tax scale adjustment for the 
year after that (see also the above table). Re -
sponsibility for adopting specific tax scale ad -
justments then lies with the Bundestag and 
Bundesrat. To date, legislators have largely fol -lowed the recommendations presented in the 
reports on inflation- induced bracket creep, or 
eased the tax burden beyond those proposals.
Tax scale used to be adjusted 
quite substantially at irregular 
intervals
In the past, there was no provision for regular 
adjustments to the income tax scale to com -
pensate for bracket creep. Instead, more exten -
sive revisions and stronger cuts to tax rates 
happened at irregular intervals.
Shortly before the turn of the millennium, the 
income tax burden, including the solidarity sur -
charge, was fairly high: the 1998- vintage tax 
scale came after a number of years without any 
regular or sizeable cuts to income tax rates.

burden significantly in the years 1999 to 2001 Minimum sub -

Hence, the 1.5- percentage- point shift in the tax rate was too small (1.5%  – 3.1% = –1.5%; difference due to rounding). The average tax 
rates imposed on real income increased as a result. 2 Normally, the tax scale was shifted in line with the estimated infl  ation rate for the 
previous year (as in central government report on bracket creep). For 2021, the shift of the income tax scale less realised infl  ation for 2020 
is shown. The tax scale thus overcompensated for bracket creep (1.5% – 0.6% = 0.9%).
Deutsche Bundesbank
6 The Bundestag mandated the Federal Government in 
2012 to report at regular intervals on inflation- induced 
bracket creep in income taxes, and central government’s 
first report on inflation- induced bracket creep was pre -
sented in January 2015. This report differs from the proced -
ure used later. At that time, a period of four years was 
covered and furthermore, tax cuts were offset more 
broadly against the effects of bracket creep. The second 
such report (published in the autumn of 2016) saw the 
Federal Government switch to a different procedure – the 
one we shall refer to in the following.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
June 2022

and 2004 to 2005, however. In 2007, mean -
while, the top rate of tax for incomes of 
€250,000 and over was raised from 42% to 
45%. The tax scale was lowered again during 
the financial crisis as part of the economic 
stimulus measures and then remained broadly 
unchanged until 2013.
Largely systematic tax scale 
adjustments since 2013
The Federal Government has been reporting on 
inflation- induced bracket creep since the 2013 
tax scale (partly retrospectively at first in the ini -
tial report of 2015). Since then, inflation-  
induced bracket creep has more or less been 
offset on the whole by tax scale adjustments:7 
the inflation rate in 2021 was higher than the 
tax scale adjustment for the previous year’s en -
visaged inflation rate (see also the table on 
p.  66). Inflation- induced bracket creep was 
therefore only partially compensated for in 
2021. However, the tax scale had been lowered 
distinctly more strongly in previous years than 
would have been necessary based on the real -
ised inflation rates. In 2019 and 2020 in par -
ticular, prices rose markedly less than projected 
for offsetting. On the one hand, this was due 
to the time lag in adjustment. On the other 
hand, inaccurate projections and deliberate 
overcompensation for the inflation also had an 
impact.
At 7%, inflation is likely to be exceptionally 
high this year. By contrast, the adjustment 
amounted to just over 1%. First, the low adjust -
ment is a reflection of the fact that the tax 
scale is regularly adjusted on the basis of the 
previous year’s inflation rate. Second, the rele -
vant 2021 inflation rate here was also signifi -
cantly underestimated.8 In May 2022, legisla -
tors responded ad hoc to strong inflation. With 
the 2022 Tax Relief Act (Steuerentlastungs-
gesetz 2022) , they decided to increase the 
basic tax allowance again retroactively from 
the beginning of 2022.9As things stand today, inflation- induced bracket 
creep is likely to be significantly more than off -
set in the coming year if the current approach 
to general tax scale adjustments is maintained 
and the inflation rate is not subject to any fur -
ther upside surprises. The inflation rate ex -
pected in the forthcoming central government 
report on inflation- induced bracket creep for 
2022 would then be included, with a time lag, 
in the 2023 tax scale. With the inflation rate 
currently anticipated to be 7%, a clear cut in 
the tax rate would be expected. This could 
cause wage tax losses of around €13½ bil -
lion.10 The coalition parties are currently dis -
cussing the extent to which inflation- induced 
bracket creep should continue to be fully com -
pensated for.
The price- adjusted tax scale 
over time
How statutory tax rates imposed on real in -
come have shifted over time can be illustrated 
using price- adjusted tax scales. The chart on

7 This includes changes to the income tax scale including 
child tax allowances. The increases in child benefit are not 
taken into account here. This is deducted from wage tax 
receipts.
8 It was determined based on the central government re -
port on inflation-  induced bracket creep from the fourth 
quarter of 2020. At the time, inflation was expected to be 
only 1.2% in 2021, whereas the result was 3.1%. However, 
the rise in the basic tax allowance had been almost suffi -
cient.
9 To a lesser extent, the basic tax allowance is to be ad -
justed retroactively to the unexpectedly high inflation rate 
in 2021. The increase is primarily explained by the high in -
flation rate in 2022. In addition to the tax scale relief (in -
cluded here), the legislator also reduced the income tax 
burden: in particular, the standard allowance for employ -
ees is to be raised retroactively as of 1 January 2022.
10 It is not yet known whether the retroactive increase in 
the basic allowance for 2022 will be offset as a kind of ad -
vance tax relief. A settlement of this kind would amount to 
around €11½ billion.
11 The income tax scale, including the solidarity surcharge, 
is considered here. Whether deduction amounts have been 
adjusted is not taken into account.

price- adjusted tax scale for 2013, for example, 
shows the individual tax rate on real incomes in 
2022 prices. Real incomes are calculated by de -
flating nominal taxable incomes in 2022 by the 
increase in prices between 2013 and 2022. If 
the 2022 tax scale is above the price- adjusted 
2013 scale, tax scale adjustments have not fully 
offset inflation- induced bracket creep. In the 
opposite case, tax scale adjustments have 
lowered the 2022 tax scale more than the tax 
burden has gone up through inflation- induced 
bracket creep. If the tax scale had been shifted 
precisely in line with the inflation rate, the tax- 
adjusted tax scale for 2022 would overlap the 
2013 tax scale exactly. This is not the case be -cause interim tax scale changes had other ob -
jectives in view besides correcting inflation-  
induced bracket creep. For example, the soli -
darity surcharge was partly abolished in 2021, 
with a marked effect on the tax scale modelled 
for 2022.
It can be seen that, starting from the high tax 
burden in 1998, tax scales fell significantly over 
the remainder of the period. Up to 2005, 
inflation- induced bracket creep was signifi -
cantly overcompensated across the entire pro -
gressive tax scale. The real tax burden then rose 
again somewhat up to 2013. In the years that 
followed, the real tax scales come closer to -Real average tax

The tax scales are shown inclusive of the respective solidarity surcharge. They are adjusted using the deflator for private consumption 
from the national accounts (for 2022: Bundesbank projection). To this end, incomes are deflated using the inflation rate from the re-
spective year in which the tax scale applied through to 2022. The respective applicable tax rates are then applied. If tax scales always 
shifted exactly in line with the inflation rate, the scales would overlap exactly. 1 Price-adjusted.

gether, meaning that, from that point onwards, 
inflation- induced bracket creep was more or 
less compensated for across the tax scale.
In 2021 there were comparatively large devi -
ations between shifts in the tax scale and 
inflation- induced bracket creep. For instance, 
the high inflation rate, when viewed in isol -
ation, caused a high level of bracket creep. The 
offsetting tax scale adjustment calculated on 
the basis of the central government report on 
bracket creep was significantly lower (see the 
table on p. 66). That said, the partial abolition 
of the solidarity surcharge provided significant 
relief, especially to medium incomes. In 2022, 
bracket creep will then be even more pro -
nounced owing to the exceptionally high infla -
tion rate.13 The tax scale was shifted only mod -
erately. The adjustment to the scale was de -
cided in 2020 on the basis of the- then still low 
inflation expectations for 2021 (see the table 
on p. 66).
Despite the recent high (and still largely un -
compensated) inflation-  induced bracket creep, 
the 2022 tax scale is relatively low for medium 
incomes. The main reason for this is the consid -
erable relief that comes from the partial aboli -
tion of the solidarity surcharge. The real tax 
scales are close to the comparatively low bur -
den of 2005. For higher incomes, the burden is 
higher than this baseline level primarily because 
the solidarity surcharge is still being levied for 
these incomes and an additional tax rate zone 
for incomes of €250,000 and over was intro -
duced in 2007 (45% instead of 42% previ -
ously). Compared with the high top tax rates in 
1998, however, real burdens were also signifi -
cantly lower in the 2022 tax scale.Open up potential 
for  improvement
Account sooner for inflation- 
induced bracket creep
Developments at the current end show why 
the current procedure does not compensate 
for inflation- induced bracket creep accurately 
and in a timely manner. First, bracket creep is 
inherently considered after a lag of one year. As 
a result, real tax rates initially rise when viewed 
in isolation, as inflation increases (e.g. in 2021 
and 2022). Second, estimation errors may 
mean that bracket creep is not being compen -
sated for accurately: inflation was underesti -
mated in 2018 and 2019, for instance. It was 
deliberately overcompensated in 2020, and 
then significantly underestimated in 2021. If in -
flation rates are comparatively stable, these 
two aspects are not of any greater significance, 
but fluctuations and sizeable estimation errors 
cannot be ruled out in the future. This is why 
the procedure is bound to lead to compensa -
tion decisions in the future that are occasion -
ally not a perfect fit.
If inflation- induced bracket creep is to be com -
pensated more precisely and in a more timely 
manner, it makes sense to adjust the proced -
ures that are currently in place. That way, it 
would be possible to account more promptly 
for unexpectedly volatile price increases or an 
exceptionally high rate of inflation. Instead of 
every two years, in future tax scales could be 
reviewed and a shift decided on a yearly basis. 
The shift in the tax scale would then only be set 
for the following year rather than for the next 
two years. Moreover, the tax scale could be 
shifted in line with the same year’s inflation 
rate rather than after a delay of one year. For 2021 and 2022:

Compensation 
for inflation-

creep directly in 
the year in 
which it occurs
13 Bracket creep often occurs when high inflation meets a 
corresponding rise in nominal wages, thus triggering a pro -
gressive increase in tax revenue. The very high inflation rate 
in 2022 is not being accompanied by correspondingly 
higher wage increases. Instead, it is leading to declining 
real wages. Here, bracket creep means that the tax burden 
nominally developed as expected, while real wages are 
lower.Deutsche Bundesbank

Bracket creep caused by general wage growth
Bracket creep due to real income 
growth as well
This article focuses on infl  ation- induced 
bracket creep in income taxation: income 
growth due solely to infl  ation increases the 
tax burden due to the progressive tax scale 
– even though the ability to pay does not 
change. It seems logical that the govern-
ment return additional revenue from 
infl  ation- induced bracket creep in a timely 
manner by shifting the tax scale. If the gov-
ernment does not compensate for the infl  a-
tion effect in the tax scale, real disposable 
income falls accordingly.
However, this infl  ation-induced bracket 
creep is just one element of bracket creep 
caused by nominal wage growth. Bracket 
creep also takes effect when real incomes 
are rising. On the one hand, the higher tax 
burden goes along with a greater individual 
ability to pay – if measured in terms of real 
income. In this respect, this bracket creep 
occurs by design: greater ability to pay 
should be subject to higher rather than 
lower tax rates in a progressive tax scale. 
Higher tax rates should apply to taxpayers 
with higher incomes than to those with 
lower incomes. On the other hand, this in-
creases the average tax rates over time1 – if 
the progressive taxation of income growth 
is not compensated for: the income growth 
of more and more taxpayers is subject to 
ever higher rates – up to the top tax rate.
A tax policy that is confi  ned solely to easing 
infl  ation- induced bracket creep thus entails 
a steady increase in the burden. This is an-
other reason why it is important to regularly 
review the tax scale and tax system as a 
whole in terms of the burdens they impose 
and their effects on the income distribution.Developments since the turn 
of the  millennium
This box illustrates developments since the 
turn of the millennium – consistent with the 
reference period in the main text – based 
on the bracket creep caused by total nom-
inal wage growth. In addition to the infl  a-
tion component, real (i.e. price- adjusted) 
wage growth over time is thus also taken 
into account. The focus on wage growth is 
chosen because wages dominate the pro-
gression zone of the income tax scale.
Since 1998, two- thirds of bracket creep has 
been accounted for by infl  ation and one- 
third by real wage growth. Bracket creep 
caused by real wages was particularly pro-
nounced in the years 1998 to 2000, 2014 
to 2016, and in 2018 and 2019.
The chart on p. 71 shows how the individ-
ual average rate of income tax according to 
the scale has changed over time, based on 
the assumption of individual income ad-
justed for the average rate of change in 
nominal gross wages and salaries (per cap-
ita). Specifi  cally, all incomes were adjusted 
for wage growth using the rate of change 
in the average wage for the respective year 
through to 2022.2 The respective income 
tax rates are then applied. If the tax scale 
had not been changed over time, these 
rates would be higher from year to year, 
owing to bracket creep caused by infl  ation 
and real wages. If, on the other hand, the 
tax scale had always been shifted in line 
1 Equally, the tax ratio (taxes relative to economic out-
put) then increases over time.
2 Thus, individual career advancement is disregarded, 
as are marriages and child benefi  t claims. Other types 
of income, such as from running a business or renting 
and leasing, are not considered either.Deutsche Bundesbank

with nominal wage developments, the 
scales would overlap exactly.
The tax scale was high in 1998 but subse-
quently fell signifi  cantly until 2005 as a re-
sult of the major tax reforms – as shown 
here, also adjusted for the interim total 
growth in nominal wages. Subsequently, 
however, bracket creep caused by wage 
growth partially reversed the reduction. For 
some income groups, tax rates temporarily 
slid back towards the 1998 scale. The par-
tial abolition of the solidarity surcharge in 
2021 then provided relief for middle- income 
households. If the government uses the tax cuts of the past few years as a guide, a 
comparatively high level of compensation 
could be expected – in order to offset the 
high infl  ation rates of 2022. The shift could 
then be stronger than nominal wage 
growth – and bring tax rates closer to the 
adjusted relatively low scale of 2005. This 
could even be undershot in some segments.Wage growth-adjusted income tax scales and deviation from the 1998 tax scale*

The tax scales are shown inclusive of the respective solidarity surcharge. The growth rates of gross wages and salaries per capita (ex-
cluding low-paid part-time employment and one-euro jobs) from the national accounts are used (for 2022: Bundesbank projection). 
Specifically, all wages have been adjusted for the rate of change in the average wage since the respective year in which the tax scale 
applied through to 2022. The respective applicable income tax rates are then applied. If the tax scale always shifted exactly in line with 
wage growth, the scales would overlap exactly. 1 Adjusted for wage growth.

instance, every autumn the tax scale could be 
adjusted for the coming year based on the gov -
ernment forecast for coming year’s inflation 
rate. Any estimation errors for previous years 
could be incorporated into the next tax scale 
shift in line with adjustment rules. For example, 
such a change in the procedure starting in 
2023 would mean that the 2023 tax scale 
would be shifted by the 2023 inflation rate esti -
mated in autumn 2022.
– At the same time, a correction would have 
to be made for estimation errors in the last 
adjustment. From today’s perspective, the 
adjustment for 2022 based on the autumn 
2020 estimate would have been far too low. 
The shortfall in the adjustment would have 
to be made up for. The ad- hoc increase in 
the basic tax allowance could count towards 
this. This would make sure, for instance, 
that the surprisingly high level of inflation 
this year does not create a lasting burden 
through bracket creep.
– The 2024 tax scale would be shifted in line 
with the inflation rate estimated in autumn 
2023 for 2024. The same process would be 
carried out in the years that followed.
On the whole, such a change in the procedure 
would help to counteract inflation- induced 
bracket creep more quickly and accurately. Un -
like an automatic adjustment, however, the de -
cision to shift tax scales would ultimately re -
main with the Bundestag and the Bundesrat. In 
this respect, this procedure does not differ 
from the current one. As a general rule, other 
ideas on how to structure the overall tax scale 
or individual areas of the tax scale can also be 
incorporated into the legislative process. For 
example, the coalition is currently discussing 
not offsetting inflation- induced bracket creep 
for high incomes. Such decisions ultimately 
have to be weighed up politically.Exclude revenue resulting from 
inflation- induced bracket creep 
from financial plans
If inflation- induced bracket creep is not compen -
sated for, government generally receives higher 
tax revenue. As long as compensation remains a 
political practice, inflation- induced bracket creep 
will not result in any additional financial leeway 
in the future. It would therefore be logical for 
central and state governments not to include 
any revenue resulting from this bracket creep in 
their (medium- term) financial plans.
For some years now, legislators have been 
using a largely rule- based procedure to correct 
inflation- induced bracket creep. However, this 
requires a specific decision to implement this. 
Official tax estimates are based on the legal 
status quo. As long as the implementation de -
cision has not yet been taken, additional rev -
enue from bracket creep is therefore included 
in the official tax estimates. In this respect, they 
are initially also included in short and medium- 
term plans – even though it has been political 
practice for many years not to let inflation-  
induced bracket creep pass through. This can 
give the wrong impression of fiscal leeway. The 
extent to which deductions allow for this is 
often not clear from the plans; greater trans -
parency is desirable in this regard. Generally 
speaking, it would be advisable to estimate 
specific global revenue shortfalls in central and 
state government’s financial plans in order to 
offset inflation-  induced bracket creep. To this 
end, the tax estimate could show the calcu -
lated revenue effects of assumed consumer 
price increases on income tax, as the financial 
effects of inflation- induced bracket creep can 
be considerable over the medium term.14 Gov-Include compen -

14 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2022b), p. 74: continued

€20.8 billion (2025) and €25.1 billion (2026). The levels are 
given for the respective year. This is based on the Federal 
Government’s spring projection, which was published in 
April 2022 and forecasts lower inflation rates than the Bun -
desbank’s May 2022 projection. The prior increase in the 
basic income tax allowance (Tax Relief Act 2022) was not 
deducted.Deutsche Bundesbank

ernments therefore should not budget for 
these funds if they intend to this offset bracket 
creep at the same time.
Regular fundamental review 
of taxation
Annual shifts in the tax scale to compensate for 
inflation- induced bracket creep do not render 
other more fundamental tax rate reforms 
superfluous. For example, real income growth 
also causes average tax rates to rise over time 
(see the box on pp. 70 ff.). The government is 
still required to review the scope and design of 
the tax system. It should be borne in mind that 
higher tax rates reduce incentives to work. 
Meanwhile, original distribution targets may 
also not have been met, for instance. The in -
centive and distributional effects of income tax -
ation overall should therefore be evaluated 
from time to time. Apart from this, it would 
seem appropriate to put an end to the legal 
uncertainty surrounding the solidarity sur -
charge.15 There is a strong case for abolishing it and, if necessary, reforming the income tax 
scale at the same time. The distribution of rev -
enue between central and state government 
should also be reviewed regularly and, in such 
a scenario, adjusted according to requirements. 
Furthermore, limited surcharges or discounts in 
income taxation specific to each federal state 
are still worth considering. This would 
strengthen the federal states and their individ -
ual responsibility.16 The weighting of the indi -
vidual types of tax within the overall mix of 
taxes should also be looked at. In the case of 
specific excise duties, the government is not 
only seeking revenue but also a steering effect. 
If fixed volume-  based tax rates are collected, 
adjustments may appear necessary after some 
time. Otherwise, inflation and real income 
gains would weaken the steering signal. Ultim -
ately, it is important for the government to bal -
ance spending needs and revenue, which also 
makes it necessary to check regularly whether 
tax hikes or cuts are appropriate.Regular review

Public finances in the euro area:  
current developments and challenges
Difficult tasks still lie ahead for fiscal policymakers in the euro area. Although the coronavirus 
pandemic is subsiding, major challenges still abound for the euro area countries, especially as a 
result of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and the transition to renewable energy. On 
top of that, public finances are in worse shape than before the coronavirus crisis. Many countries 
have very high debt ratios and high deficits. At the same time, the macroeconomic conditions 
have changed. The baseline scenarios of current forecasts for the euro area assume that the eco -
nomic recovery will continue. However, there are considerable supply- side tensions. Price pres -
sures are high and threaten to become entrenched. Monetary policymakers have therefore initi -
ated an interest rate reversal.
In such a situation, prudent fiscal policy is essential. Additional broad- based, debt- financed sup -
port measures and fiscal stimuli are not appropriate. Fiscal policy should instead be targeted. 
Measures that lower energy prices do not fit this description. In addition, they lessen incentives 
for switching to renewable energy and make saving energy less attractive. Instead, measures 
should provide targeted support for low- income households, for instance, as they are hit espe -
cially hard by rising prices. Additional government funds are likely to be needed for the transition 
to renewable energy and for defence activities. However, there is good reason to largely counter -
finance targeted additional measures within the budget, too: higher deficits threaten to amplify 
the existing price pressures and thus to be counterproductive for the economy as a whole. More -
over, public finances, which are already severely strained in some areas, would be further bur -
dened at a time when the focus should be on returning them to a sound footing.
Yet uncertainty about future developments runs high. A different fiscal policy approach would be 
advisable if negative risks were to materialise – for instance, if demand did in fact collapse. At 
present, however, this scenario does not form the baseline of most forecasts, including that of the 
European Commission. Thus, there is no convincing case for the extension of the general escape 
clause under the European fiscal rules until 2023. Even without this decision, only a few Member 
States would have had to tighten their planned fiscal stance, whereas now the extension creates 
scope for additional debt- financed fiscal programmes, which do not appear appropriate as things 
currently stand. The fiscal situation is fragile in some Member States. The national fiscal policy -
makers in each Member State are thus called on to strengthen confidence in sound public 
finances. In this environment, credible fiscal rules are more important than ever, as binding and 
comprehensible rules can build confidence. Therefore, a stability- oriented reform of the European 
fiscal rules is key.Deutsche Bundesbank

European Commission 
 forecast on the development 
of public finances
Euro area: decline in deficit 
and debt ratio
The European Commission (hereinafter referred 
to as the Commission) expects1 the deficit ratio 
in the euro area to decline this year and next. 
After reaching 5.1% last year, it is forecast to 
fall to 3.7% and 2.5%, respectively. This is due, 
first, to improvements in the economic situ -
ation. According to the Commission, the out -
put gap will be fully closed by 2023. The deficit 
ratio will therefore fall by ¾ percentage point 
in 2022 and by ½ percentage point in 2023. 
Second, budget- burdening measures are expir -
ing. The Commission estimates that measures 
related to the coronavirus pandemic still 
amounted to 3¼% of gross domestic product 
(GDP) in 2021. They will fall to ¾% this year 
and are then expected to come to an end en -
tirely.2 Commission estimates for new measures 
in connection with the war in Ukraine and 
soaring energy prices amount to ¾% of GDP 
for 2022. These deficit- increasing measures are 
mostly set to expire in 2023. The easing effect 
of cyclical and temporary influences masks the 
fact that the other budgetary developments are 
increasing the deficit ratio markedly: by 1¼ per -
centage points in 2022 and ¼  percentage 
point in 2023. According to the Commission’s 
forecast, the debt ratio will fall from 97.4% last 
year to 92.7% in 2023, driven mainly by the ra -
ther sharp increase in nominal GDP in the de -
nominator.
It is particularly difficult to assess the current 
fiscal stance at present. The conventional indi -
cator does indeed show a restrictive stance (i.e. 
a fall in the structural3 primary deficit ratio) for 
this and next year combined. However, this is 
mainly due to the expiry of coronavirus meas -
ures. These government measures often re -
placed losses in income or turnover that house -
holds and enterprises suffered during the 
coronavirus crisis, but these can now be earned as usual. This means that the replacement pay -
ments can largely be brought to an end with -
out this having a restrictive effect. This is similar 
to cyclical fluctuations in unemployment ex -
penditure (automatic stabiliser). In the same 
vein, it would therefore be more appropriate to 
remove a large part of these expiring corona -
virus measures from the indicator, which does 
not contain automatic stabilisers. The fiscal pol -
icy stance for 2022 and 2023 together is thus 
likely to be interpretable not as restrictive but, 
in fact, as rather expansionary.
Fiscal situation varies widely 
among the Member States
The fiscal situation varies widely among the 
Member States (see the table on p. 78). How -
ever, it is expected to improve in all countries in 
2022 and 2023, driven mainly by the expiry of 
coronavirus measures. Nevertheless, in 2022, 
12 countries will have a deficit ratio above the 
reference value of 3%. This figure will still 
amount to seven in 2023, including the very 
highly indebted countries of Belgium, France, 
Italy and Spain. By contrast, in Greece and Por -
tugal – which also have very high debt ratios – 
the deficit ratios will fall to 1% by 2023.
Next to no Member State is expected to achieve 
the target of a structurally close- to- balance 
budget (medium- term objective, MTO) by 
2023. This means that, for the most part, the 
situation is substantially less favourable than 
prior to the coronavirus pandemic. At the same 
time, the Commission forecast concludes that 
the output gap is closed in most countries, and 
the burden stemming from temporary crisis 
measures is now only of minor importance. In 
Belgium, France, Italy, Malta, Slovenia and 
Spain, the structural deficit ratios are above 3% Lower deficit

Fiscal analysis distorted by the lack of data on EU- level 
 defi  cits and debt
The European Commission does not report 
EU- level defi  cits and debt in its economic 
forecast; nor does Eurostat (the European 
Commission’s statistical offi   ce) yet make 
these available for past periods. The Euro-
pean Commission’s data for the EU and for 
the euro area therefore cover only the ag-
gregated defi  cits and debt of the Member 
States. The fact that the EU Council is call-
ing for the compilation of EU institutions’ 
statistics is a welcome development. It would 
be desirable for Eurostat to provide them in 
the same structure and defi  nitions as re-
quired for the Member States (in line with 
the national accounts and the Maastricht 
defi  nitions).
The picture on public fi  nances is distorted 
as a result of incomplete data. If the Euro-
pean Commission incurs debt on behalf of 
the EU and uses it to make transfers to the 
Member States, a defi  cit is created at the 
EU level that is not counted in national gov-
ernment budgets. Yet these transfers, taken 
in isolation, reduce the defi  cits and debt of 
the Member States. The EU- level defi  cits 
generate EU- level debt, which –  like na-
tional debt – has to be shouldered by the 
taxpayers of the Member States. In eco-
nomic terms, this means that defi  cits are 
merely shifted within the EU (from the 
Member States to the EU level), while the 
statistics report lower defi  cits and lower 
debt for the EU as a whole.
Last year, a marked defi  cit was recorded for 
the fi  rst time at the EU level owing to the 
NextGenerationEU (NGEU) recovery fund. 
This may have amounted to around ½% of 
gross domestic product (GDP). Up to 2026, 
further defi  cits are planned for the purposes 
of paying NGEU grants to EU countries.1 According to the Stability and Convergence 
Programmes, the euro area countries set to 
record the largest receipts from grants of 
this kind up to 2026 are Greece (a total of 
around 8% of GDP), Portugal and Spain 
(around 5½% of GDP each).2
For analytical purposes, reported defi  cits 
and debt for the EU should include the EU 
level. In addition, EU- level defi  cits and debt 
should be taken into account when assess-
ing the fi  nances of the individual Member 
States. As things stand, EU- level debt is 
being serviced from the EU budget. Na-
tional taxpayers will therefore have to make 
higher contributions to the EU budget in fu-
ture. Member States’ fi  nancing of the EU 
budget is broadly in line with their share in 
the EU’s gross national income (GNI). In 
economic analyses, it would therefore make 
sense to allocate EU- level defi  cits and debt 
to the Member States according to their 
GNI share.3
Moreover, the European fi  scal rules should 
also be applied including the EU- level def-
icits and debt. Otherwise, the rules are in 
danger of becoming ineffective: borrowing 
could simply be shifted to the EU level, ren-
dering it exempt.
1 In addition, the supranational EU debt is being used 
to make NGEU assistance loans to EU countries. Statis-
tically, this is not refl  ected in the EU defi  cit but only in 
EU- level debt.
2 See European Commission (2022b). The data are not 
complete, however.
3 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2020). Introducing new 
taxes to fi  nance the EU budget will not alleviate the 
burden on taxpayers either.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
June 2022  
77

for 2023 despite the fact that, in some cases, 
extensive transfers from the NextGenerationEU 
recovery fund are alleviating the burden on 
government budgets. As long as a Member 
State fails to meet its budgetary objective, the 
fiscal rules require convergence towards it. For 
this to happen, the country usually has to re -
duce its structural deficit by 0.5% of GDP per 
year. The standard limits will not apply next 
year, as the general escape clause has been ex -
tended. Nevertheless, according to the Com -
mission’s forecast, most countries will achieve 
the regular improvement of 0.5% of GDP – 
often even with room to spare. Only Spain is 
set to fall short of this consolidation step and 
widen the already large gap between its pos -
ition and the budgetary objective. The main 
reason for the significant structural improve -
ment in most Member States is that the struc -
tural balances reported by the Commission also 
include temporary measures. These will expire 
in 2023 according to the plans.Debt ratios will fall in all countries in 2022 and 
2023, but often only moderately. In some 
cases, primary deficits are high and are damp -
ening the impact of very favourable interest 
rate- growth patterns. Owing to the extensive 
fiscal stabilisation during the coronavirus crisis, 
debt ratios are mostly set to be significantly 
higher in 2023 than before the pandemic. The 
gap is particularly large in those countries that 
were already heavily indebted, with the excep -
tion of Greece and Cyprus.
New challenges for fiscal 
policy
Times of crisis place particular demands on the 
state. During the coronavirus crisis, for ex -
ample, it was important to bring in supportive 
measures. The economy collapsed, demand 
was also low, and price pressures were initially 
weak. Amid such conditions, it was appropriate 
for Member States to finance measures through Debt ratios in 
2023 very high

deficits and thus through greater debt. Al -
though the coronavirus pandemic is subsiding, 
fiscal policy (too) still faces major challenges, 
particularly on account of Russia’s war of ag -
gression against Ukraine and the necessary 
transition to renewable energy sources. How -
ever, given that the underlying conditions are 
fundamentally different from the situation dur -
ing the coronavirus crisis, the fiscal policy re -
sponse should also be different.
In its baseline scenario, the Commission (like 
other institutions) projects that the economy 
will recover. The output gap is expected to 
close in 2023. At the same time, there are 
supply- side tensions, and price pressures are 
high and threaten to become entrenched. This 
has prompted monetary policymakers to initi -
ate an interest rate reversal and announce their 
intention to dial back the expansionary stance. 
They want to prevent inflation expectations 
from becoming de- anchored.
When it comes to public finances, deficits and 
debt remain high – in some cases very high. 
Rising risk premia in the capital markets, in par -
ticular, indicate that there is an increasing need 
to strengthen confidence in the soundness of 
public finances again. It is therefore important 
for the concrete planning of highly indebted 
Member States to exhibit marked declines in 
their debt ratios. It is up to fiscal policymakers 
at the national level to make their country’s 
public finances more resilient. Creating the 
European Stability Mechanism (ESM) has 
brought into play an intergovernmental fiscal 
institution that can provide assistance in this 
endeavour, if needed. It is not the task of mon -
etary policy, on the other hand, to guarantee 
fiscal policy leeway and favourable capital mar -
ket funding conditions.
Against this macroeconomic and fiscal back -
drop, prudent fiscal policy is important. At 
present, general, debt- financed support meas -
ures and fiscal stimuli are not appropriate. This 
does not mean that fiscal policy is incapable of 
acting and has to forego necessary measures. However, it is – first – advisable to provide sup -
port only on a temporary and targeted basis. 
Measures that lower energy prices do not fit 
this description. In addition, they lessen incen -
tives for switching to renewable energy and 
cutting energy consumption and thus run 
counter to key climate policy objectives. In -
stead, any measures should be targeted, for ex -
ample, at low- income households – as they are 
hit especially hard by rising energy prices – and 
at those enterprises which are particularly af -
fected and have a valid business model. Add -
itional, carefully directed government funds are 
also likely to be needed for defence and the 
transition to renewable energy sources. As a 
second point, any new targeted measures of 
this kind should not be financed with debt ei -
ther. Instead, the countries should largely coun -
terfinance additional measures within their 
budgets: higher deficits threaten to amplify the 
existing price pressures and thus to be counter -
productive for the economy as a whole. More -
over, bigger deficits would further burden pub -
lic finances, which are already severely strained 
in some areas, at a time when the focus should 
be on returning them to a sound footing.
Yet uncertainty about future developments is 
high. And a different fiscal policy approach 
would be advisable if existing negative risks 
were to materialise – for instance, if demand 
did in fact weaken on a broad basis. However, 
such a scenario is not the baseline at present 
and, as such, it should not form the basis for 
current planning.
Use the reform of fiscal rules 
to build confidence
The fiscal situation is fragile in some countries, 
and risk premia in the capital markets have re -
cently increased. This is an environment in 
which credible, binding fiscal rules are more

In May 2022, the Commission recommended 
the continued suspension of EU fiscal rules. The 
general escape clause, which was first acti -
vated in 2020, is to be extended until 2023, 
with the Commission pointing to heightened 
uncertainty and strong downside risks as justifi -
cation. It decided against reactivating the ap -
plicable budgetary limits next year, arguing that 
the situation has not yet normalised and that 
countries need to be given space to respond to 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the energy 
supply problems that this is entailing. The Com -
mission also pointed out that the absence of 
budgetary rules will enable the transition from 
broad- based to targeted support. The euro 
area finance ministers (Eurogroup) welcomed 
the extension of the general escape clause.
There is no convincing case for extending the 
general escape clause at this time. The decision 
to do so does not tally with the improving eco -
nomic situation currently projected in the base -
line scenario. It is also concerning that the 
Commission does not go into more detail 
about what it regards as normal. For example, 
there is reason to think that high energy prices 
will be the norm in future too – at that point, 
in the context of more stringent climate policy. 
However, this should not result in exemptions 
from debt limits; sustainable climate policy 
should not come at the expense of sustainable 
fiscal policy.
The possibility that risks will arise in the future 
and that extending the general escape clause 
would ultimately make sense after all cannot 
be ruled out. However, it would have been ap -
propriate to review this again at a later date, 
rather than pre- emptively suspending the 
standard fiscal limits.
From today’s perspective, even without the 
general escape clause, the rules do not unduly 
restrict fiscal leeway for 2023. It is true that 
structural deficit ratios would then need to be 
brought down by 0.5% per year, as almost all 
euro area countries are in breach of at least 
one of the quantitative caps (the 3% reference value for the budget deficit, the debt limit of 
60% or the medium- term budgetary objective). 
However, the Commission’s forecast sees al -
most all euro area countries achieving this im -
provement without consolidation measures, as 
expiring coronavirus measures are taken into 
account. But the extended general escape 
clause now opens up scope for additional def -
icits in the coming year. This is not an advisable 
course of action (see above).
As part of its regular budgetary surveillance, 
the Commission also examined whether coun -
tries were running excessive deficits necessitat -
ing excessive deficit procedures. This is because 
the general escape clause does not override ex -
cessive deficit procedures, only the quantitative 
limits for excessive deficits laid down in the 
rules. Many countries exceeded the deficit and 
debt reference values in 2021 or plan to exceed 
them in 2022. The Commission recommends 
that no procedures be opened4 as it believes 
that the situation is currently too uncertain to 
set out a detailed path for fiscal policy. It is also 
of the opinion that the “ 1∕20 debt reduction 
path”5 is too demanding for those countries 
under review with debt above 60% of GDP , 
reasoning that countries complying with this 
adjustment path might risk lower GDP growth.
Regardless of the decision to maintain the gen -
eral escape clause for 2022, it would be con -
cerning if the method currently pursued by the 
Commission in its fiscal surveillance were to be 
applied to future assessments under the rules. 
As in the country- specific recommendations, 
the Commission looks at growth in various ex -
penditure categories. It does not take thresh -Case for extend -

4 The Commission has published a report in accordance 
with Article 126(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the 
European Union (TFEU), in which it reviews the opening of 
excessive deficit procedures for all 18 countries that ap -
pear, prima facie, to be in breach of the criteria. See Euro -
pean Commission (2022c).
5 The debt criterion requires that a debt ratio above 60% 
nears this reference value at a sufficient pace. This require -
ment is fleshed out further in regulations. Accordingly, the 
portion of debt in excess of the reference value is meant to 
decrease by one- twentieth per year. However, other fac -
tors, not exhaustively listed, are to be taken into account as 
well.Deutsche Bundesbank

olds for expenditure growth overall as a basis. 
For example, when it comes to current primary 
expenditure, any deficit- increasing measure re -
lated to higher energy prices is excused. More -
over, high and rising investment expenditure is 
welcomed with open arms. There is then the 
risk that high structural deficits or high debt 
ratios might fall off the radar.
This year, the Commission intends to present 
proposals for reforming the fiscal rules. A pro -
posal to establish its current approach as a rule 
would be highly problematic. This would make 
fiscal policy stance the subject of only vague 
qualitative coordination between the Commis -
sion and individual countries. It would also be 
inappropriate to exclude some categories of 
expenditure from quantitative limits. That could 
lead to persistently high and even rising debt ratios. Reforms should therefore instead aim at 
setting binding numerical budgetary ceilings. 
This means that the rules should be determined 
ex ante, be transparent and set out concrete 
quantified requirements. The stipulations 
should be non- negotiable. And they should be 
chosen in such a way that a high debt ratio re -
liably shrinks if a country complies with the 
rules. Breaches of the rules should be sanc -
tioned. It is important to build confidence that 
the rules will guide public finances onto a 
sound path. Such confidence makes things eas -
ier for fiscal policymakers, but it also helps 
monetary policymakers. In this spirit, the Bun -
desbank has put forward proposals on how the 
Stability and Growth Pact could be improved in 
a stability- oriented manner.6Reform of fiscal

The Bundesbank’s surveys of firms – 
applications  for assessing the financial 
situation  in the corporate sector
In order to fulfil its tasks – in monetary policy, financial stability and banking supervision, for 
example – the Deutsche Bundesbank needs up- to- date information on the situation in the Ger -
man economy and the corporate sector. Given the important role that corporate financing plays 
for German banks, timely insights into developments in the corporate sector are of particular 
interest when assessing the state of the financial system. This is especially true in times when eco -
nomic conditions can change very quickly as a result of extraordinary events, such as the corona -
virus pandemic or the Russian war against Ukraine. Against this backdrop, the Bundesbank 
launched two surveys to assess and evaluate the financial situation of the corporate sector in a 
targeted and timely manner: a regular survey of firms (Bundesbank Online Panel Firms) and – dur -
ing the pandemic – an ad hoc survey of industry associations. In this context, both surveys can 
be used to obtain up- to- date information on the financial situations and business conditions of 
enterprises as well as to capture potential developments and future challenges by asking respond -
ents about their expectations.
At the beginning of the pandemic, the Bundesbank was able to use the survey data to assess the 
impact of the measures taken to contain the spread of the virus. The survey data reveal striking 
differences between sectors, confirming the insights gained from the analyses on German enter -
prises’ profitability and financing presented in the Monthly Report of December 2021. In the 
spring of 2020, for instance, the coronavirus containment measures were accompanied by a con -
siderable decline in business activity, especially amongst enterprises from particularly affected 
services sectors such as retail trade, transportation and storage, and the accommodation and 
food service activities sector. These firms suffered a drop in and also reported increased financing 
needs. Furthermore, access to loans became more difficult while liquidity reserves dwindled.
The Bundesbank’s most recent surveys show that the financial situation in the corporate sector 
improved at the beginning of 2022 as compared with the situation in 2020. In the first quarter of 
2022, there were considerably fewer concerns about potential liquidity bottlenecks than there 
had been in the initial phase of the pandemic. However, supply- side difficulties, such as the short -
age of skilled workers, higher costs and supply chain bottlenecks, have become more important. 
The last two challenges, in particular, have been significantly aggravated by the Russian invasion 
of Ukraine. At the beginning of 2022, energy- intensive enterprises, especially, saw their financing 
needs increase, while lending conditions tightened for these enterprises.
Using the survey data, it was possible to capture the consequences of the war against Ukraine for 
the corporate sector in a timely manner. For example, firms with economic relations with Russia 
or Ukraine reported a greater impact on their business activities and higher financing needs in 
comparison with enterprises with no relations with either country.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
In order to fulfil its tasks – in monetary policy, 
financial stability and banking supervision, for 
example – the Deutsche Bundesbank needs up- 
to- date information on the situation in the Ger -
man economy. The Bundesbank possesses ex -
tensive information on the corporate sector 
and its financial situation through the reporting 
system and the annual financial statement sta -
tistics for enterprises.1 However, in 2020, the 
Bundesbank identified the need for dedicated 
surveys on the business situation in the corpo -
rate sector in order to obtain timely insights 
into developments within the non- financial 
sector. This is particularly pertinent with regard 
to assessing developments in the financial sys -
tem, as corporate financing plays an important 
role for German banks. Against this backdrop, 
the Bundesbank launched two surveys to as -
sess and evaluate the financial situation of the 
corporate sector in a targeted and timely man -
ner: a regular survey of enterprises and – dur -
ing the pandemic – an ad hoc survey of indus -
try associations.
As part of the Bundesbank Online Panel Firms 
(BOP- F), the Bundesbank surveys a representa -
tive sample of enterprises with regard to their 
situations, assessments and expectations. The 
survey of firms was launched in June 2020 and 
has been conducted on a quarterly basis since 
July 2021. Each survey is divided into three 
rounds, so that information on developments 
in the corporate sector can be collected at a 
monthly frequency. Around 10,000 firms par -
ticipate in the survey each quarter. Half of the 
questionnaire consists of “core” questions, 
which are asked in every survey and thus allow 
for a comparison over time. These include, for 
example, questions on developments in busi -
ness activities, expectations and financing 
needs. The other half consists of varying ques -
tion modules that may address current events, 
such as the impact of the war on Ukraine on 
sales figures, as well as structural characteristics 
of enterprises, such as their energy consump -
tion.In addition, the Bundesbank has repeatedly 
surveyed industry associations on develop -
ments in the financial situations of their mem -
ber enterprises. These surveys were conducted 
at irregular intervals, enabling analyses of the 
impact of selected events on the financial situ -
ation in the corporate sector. The associations 
were surveyed three times in 2020, while the 
fourth and most recent survey took place in 
January 2022.2 On average, around 40 associa -
tions have participated in each survey so far. 
The survey of associations contains only a rela -
tively small number of questions, some of 
which are open- ended. This allows for relatively 
quick evaluation of the data and means that 
the survey also captures aspects that are not 
explicitly addressed in the questions.
In the context of the coronavirus pandemic and 
the Russian invasion of Ukraine, both surveys 
have proven to be useful for the timely assess -
ment of developments and financing condi -
tions in the corporate sector. These events 
changed the economic environment at a pace 
and to an extent rarely seen in recent decades. 
For example, the measures taken since spring 
2020 to contain the pandemic have led, 
amongst other things, to a sharp decline in de -
mand, meaning that enterprises have been 
confronted with large declines in sales. The 
pandemic also created difficulties for interna -
tional supply chains. Moreover, energy and 
producer prices rose significantly in 2021. These 
issues were further exacerbated by the Russian 
invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. For ex -
ample, firms with economic relations with Rus -
sia or Ukraine reported a greater impact on 
their business activities and higher financing 
needs compared with enterprises with no rela -
tions with either country. However, these en -
terprises represent a small part of the corporate 
sector.Need for inde -

Development of the business 
situation in the corporate 
sector since the outbreak of 
the coronavirus pandemic
The information gleaned from both surveys can 
be used to depict current developments in the 
financial situation and business conditions in 
the corporate sector. This applies to enter -
prises’ business activities and liquidity situations 
as well as to developments in their need for ex -
ternal financing. In addition, by asking ques -
tions on expectations, it is possible to gauge 
potential developments and future challenges 
for non- financial corporations. This information 
can be used to assess the impact of extraordi -
nary events such as the coronavirus pandemic 
on the corporate sector.
Enterprises are regularly asked about the latest 
developments in their key metrics. At the be -
ginning of the pandemic, the measures to con -
tain the spread of the virus had a particularly 
pronounced impact on demand. In June 2020, 
for instance, 58% of enterprises reported a de -
cline in business activity as a result of the coro -
navirus pandemic. At the time of the fourth 
survey in February 2021, the share of enter -
prises that recorded a decline in their business 
activities compared with the same month a 
year earlier stood at 48%. There were consider -
able differences across sectors. For instance, 
accommodation and food service activities, 
transportation and storage, and retail trade3 
were particularly affected by the impact of the 
pandemic.4 In the latest survey from the sec -
ond quarter of 2022, enterprises were again 
asked about developments in their sales fig -
ures. Between March 2021 and March 2022, 
28% of the responding enterprises recorded a 
decline in sales, while the share of firms report -
ing rising sales reached 35%.
The situation in terms of firms’ liquid assets has 
also improved. At the beginning of the pan -
demic in spring 2020, 46% of the surveyed en -
terprises reported a decline in liquid assets. 
During the lockdown of winter 2020-21, this share stood at 36% and stabilised at 28% in 
2021. The percentage of enterprises reporting 
an increase in liquid funds rose from 8% in 
spring 2020 to 22% at the end of 2021.
By contrast, enterprises’ access to intermediate 
inputs worsened, particularly over the course 
of 2021. At the beginning of the pandemic, 
43% of enterprises reported a deterioration in 
their access to intermediate inputs. This share 
initially fell to 36% in the first quarter of 2021. 
Supply difficulties then worsened again, with 
56% of enterprises reporting a deterioration in 
their access to intermediate inputs in the first 
quarter of 2022.
Supply chain bottlenecks and the extensive 
phasing- out of coronavirus containment meas -
ures are linked to the development of current 
trade receivables and payables. In the first sur -
vey in June 2020, enterprises reported a signif -
icant decline at the beginning of the pandemic, 
with 33% of enterprises reporting a decline in 
trade receivables and 26% a decrease in trade 
payables. Both metrics increased again over the 
course of the pandemic. The percentage of en -
terprises with declining trade receivables or 
trade payables fell steadily to 14% and 13%, 
respectively, at the end of 2021, while the share 
of enterprises with increasing trade receivables 
or trade payables went up from 11% and 9%, 
respectively, in spring 2020 to 19% and 15% in 
the first quarter of 2022.
Enterprises considered their access to financing 
to be fairly stable. The share of enterprises re -
porting difficulties in accessing financing 
sources has remained constant at around 15% 
since the first survey.
The economic recovery is also reflected in the 
survey of industry associations. In November 
2020 and January 2022, the surveyed associa -
tions were asked about the share of their mem -Sharp decline in

ber enterprises that had experienced a de -
crease in sales compared with a typical quarter 
(the fourth quarter of 2019, for example). In 
November 2020, the median share of enter -
prises with a decrease in sales was just under 
50%. By the following survey in January 2022, 
the median share of member enterprises re -
porting declining sales figures had fallen to 
20%. Considerable differences across sectors 
remain. Associations noted that, in particular, 
the enterprises belonging to the sectors ac -
commodation and food service activities, 
events, and personal service activities (cosmet -
ics, hairdressers, etc.) were still being affected by the impact of coronavirus containment 
measures at the beginning of 2022.
In the BOP- F survey, enterprises are regularly 
asked about their expectations and greatest 
challenges. The repercussions of the pandemic 
are reflected especially clearly in the way in 
which these challenges have evolved. In spring 
2020, the lack of customer demand was classi -
fied as a particularly serious problem for the 
subsequent six months, with 42% of enter -
prises rating the absence of demand as a press -
ing or extremely pressing problem for the sub -
sequent six months. In June 2020, the follow -
ing problems were considered pressing or ex -Challenges

tremely pressing: competitive pressure and the 
shortage of skilled labour (both 31%), high la -
bour and production costs (22%), difficulties in 
accessing financing (17%), and supply difficul -
ties (10%).
The challenges faced by enterprises have 
shifted significantly over the course of the pan -
demic. The percentage of enterprises that con -
sidered potential declines in demand as a press -
ing or extremely pressing problem fell steadily 
to 22% in the first quarter of 2022. By contrast, 
the importance of supply- side difficulties grew 
considerably. The share of enterprises expect -
ing to experience difficulties due to shortages 
in the availability of skilled labour rose from 
31% in spring 2020 to 67% at the beginning of 
2022. This period also saw a significant rise in 
the challenges posed by high labour and pro -
duction costs (from 22% to 53%) as well as by 
supply chain difficulties (from 10% to 44%).
Developments in enterprises’ 
financial situations over the 
course of the pandemic
Enterprises’ financial situations have exhibited a 
similar sectoral pattern to that of the pandem -
ic’s impact on enterprises’ business activities. 
For instance, the impact of the pandemic was 
particularly evident in the retail trade, accom -
modation and food service activities, and trans -
portation and storage sectors. Financing needs 
in these sectors grew sharply at the onset of 
the pandemic between April and May 2020 (in -
creased significantly: 24%, increased slightly: 
11%). At the end of 2020, these figures rose 
again somewhat (increased significantly: 27%, 
increased slightly: 13%). In other sectors, 12% 
of enterprises reported a significant increase in 
financing needs and 11% a slight increase at 
both of these points in time. In 2021, the refer -
ence period was extended from one month to 
one year, meaning that the figures are not di -
rectly comparable. Nevertheless, this disparity 
across sectors with respect to enterprises’ 
financing needs related to the pandemic was still pronounced in 2021, albeit to a lesser de -
gree. Compared with the same months in the 
previous year, the percentage of enterprises in 
sectors affected by the pandemic with in -
creased financing needs stood at 33% in both 
June and December 2021 (increased signifi -
cantly: 9%, increased slightly: 24%). Mean -
while, this share remained stable at 23% in 
other sectors (increased significantly: 6%, in -
creased slightly: 17%).
The improvement of the situation in the corpo -
rate sector is also reflected in the development 
of initiated credit negotiations. At the start of 
the pandemic in the spring of 2020, around Particularly high

28% of enterprises reported that they had initi -
ated negotiations for a bank loan in the three 
months prior to the survey. This share had al -
ready fallen below 20% by the end of 2020 
and then fell steadily to 13% in the fourth quar -
ter of 2021. A sectoral breakdown with respect 
to the impact of the pandemic shows that around 40% of enterprises from affected sec -
tors initiated credit negotiations in the spring of 
2020, while this share was around 25% for en -
terprises from other sectors. These sectoral dif -
ferences have steadily diminished over the 
course of the pandemic. The percentage of en -
terprises from affected sectors that had initi -
ated credit negotiations stood at 23% at the 
end of 2020 and fell to 15% by the fourth 
quarter of 2021. By contrast, the share of en -
terprises conducting credit negotiations in 
other sectors fell from 18% at the end of 2020 
to 13% in the fourth quarter of 2021.
The impact of the pandemic on the corporate 
sector can also be gauged from the results of 
loan negotiations that were conducted. For in -
stance, banks were rather cautious about lend -
ing at the beginning of the pandemic in spring 
2020. Just one- third of the credit negotiations 
conducted were concluded at the desired con -
ditions, and 15% of negotiations resulted in 
loans being granted at less favourable condi -
tions. By contrast, 22% of credit negotiations 
had not yet been finalised by the time of the 
survey in June-  July 2020, while 28% had been 
concluded without a deal.
Lending conditions improved significantly for 
enterprises over the further course of the pan -
demic. At the end of 2020, 44% of credit ne -
gotiations had been approved at the desired 
conditions. This share subsequently improved 
to around 50% over the course of 2021. The 
share of credit negotiations approved at less fa -
vourable conditions increased to 21% by 2021. 
Meanwhile, the percentages of credit negotia -
tions that were still pending or had been con -
cluded without a deal at the time of the survey 
both fell to around 15% in 2021.
The survey of industry associations also shows 
that enterprises’ access to credit improved over 
the course of the pandemic. In January 2022, 
two- thirds of associations reported no deterio -
ration in their member enterprises’ access to 
bank loans during the fourth quarter of 2021 
despite renewed restrictions. Overall, access to Share of enter -

credit was much less restricted across all sec -
tors in January 2022 than it had been in No -
vember 2020. Only enterprises in the accom -
modation and food service activities and per -
sonal service activities sectors reported ongo -
ing difficulties in obtaining loans. In January 
2022, rejected loan applications represented a 
considerable problem for a total of 42% of as -
sociations (applications rejected very often: 
17%, often: 25%). In November 2020, how -
ever, rejections had been a problem for 80% of 
associations, with 50% reporting their mem -
bers’ applications being rejected often and 
30% very often. The percentage of associations 
whose member enterprises complained about 
long processing times for loan applications also 
declined between November 2020 and January 
2022 (from 75% to 59%). During this period, 
the percentage of associations whose mem -
bers reported less favourable credit conditions 
also declined, from 90% to 60%.
The fact that the financial situation in the cor -
porate sector improved between November 
2020 and January 2022 is also reflected by the 
reduced share of enterprises reporting existen -
tial difficulties. In this respect, the January 2022 
survey of associations reveals that – as meas -
ured by the median across the associations – 
5% of enterprises perceived their existence as 
threatened. This represents a significant im -
provement compared with the 25% of enter -
prises that saw existential threats to their busi -
ness in the November 2020 survey.
The data on available liquidity reserves in the 
survey of firms confirm that the financial bottle -
necks in the corporate sector were less severe 
in the course of 2021. Enterprises were asked 
to estimate for how long a period they would 
continue to have sufficient liquidity before hav -
ing to discontinue or abandon their business 
activities. The share of enterprises with gener -
ally sufficient liquidity rose from 40% at the be -
ginning of 2021 to 51% in the third quarter of 
2021. In the first quarter of 2022, this share av -
eraged 48%. The share of enterprises facing, in 
their own estimation, acute liquidity bottle -necks (liquidity reserves of up to two months) 
fell from 20% in the first quarter of 2021 to 
10% in the summer of 2021. However, the lat -
est figures from the first quarter of 2022 show

A sectoral differentiation helps provide further 
insights into the development of potential 
liquidity bottlenecks. At the beginning of 2021, 
nearly one- third of enterprises in sectors par -
ticularly affected by the pandemic (retail trade, 
transportation and storage, and accommoda -
tion and food service activities) possessed 
liquidity reserves of up to two months, while 
22% reported generally sufficient liquidity. By 
contrast, the share of enterprises from other 
sectors with liquidity reserves of up to two 
months was 17% and the share with generally 
sufficient liquidity was 44%. These differences 
were hardly apparent in the third quarter of 
2021. In both sectoral groups, the share of en -terprises with liquidity reserves of up to two 
months fell to 10% in each case. The share of 
enterprises with generally sufficient liquidity 
rose to 45% in the affected sectors and to 52% 
in other sectors. In the first quarter of 2022, 
the liquidity situation in both groups of enter -
prises deteriorated again somewhat, but not to 
the level reported in the same quarter of the 
previous year. The share of enterprises with 
liquidity reserves of up to two months rose to 
16% in the affected sectors and to 13% in 
other sectors. The share of enterprises with 
generally sufficient liquidity declined slightly to 
42% in the affected sectors and 50% in other 
sectors.
Current developments in the 
corporate sector in light of 
high energy prices and the 
Russian invasion of Ukraine
Whilst a large part of the coronavirus contain -
ment measures were lifted at the beginning of 
2022, rising energy and producer prices as well 
as the Russian invasion of Ukraine posed new 
challenges for the corporate sector.
Energy prices, which had already risen in 2021, 
surged significantly once again as a result of 
the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Energy-  
intensive enterprises in particular have felt the 
effects of this development. The survey of firms 
conducted in the first quarter of 2022 was able 
to obtain a picture of enterprises’ energy inten -
sity by asking about the share of their produc -
tion costs comprised of costs for energy 
sources. In the following, enterprises with an 
energy cost share of more than 20% are classi -
fied as energy- intensive. This applied to 17% of 
the enterprises surveyed in the first quarter of 
2022.
With regard to energy intensity, the survey 
from the first quarter of 2022 shows significant 
differences in the assessment of future chal -
lenges. The differences in the assessment of

sources were particularly striking. Amongst 
energy- intensive enterprises, the percentage of 
enterprises that rated high labour and produc -
tion costs as a pressing or extremely pressing 
problem for the subsequent six months stood 
at 65%, while 22% considered access to financ -
ing problematic. By contrast, in the first quarter 
of 2022, high production costs and access to 
financing were classified as pressing or ex -
tremely pressing problems by 50% and 14% of 
enterprises with low energy intensity, respec -
tively.
Recent survey data shows that energy- intensive 
enterprises reported greater financing needs 
than enterprises with low energy intensity. 
Amongst energy- intensive enterprises, the 
share of enterprises that conducted negotia -
tions for a bank loan held steady at 18% in the 
fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 
2022. For enterprises with low energy intensity, 
this share rose slightly from 12% in the fourth 
quarter of 2021 to 14% in the first quarter of 2022. The results of credit negotiations have 
recently been significantly worse for energy-  
intensive enterprises. For these enterprises, the 
share of credit negotiations concluded at the 
desired conditions fell from 47% in the third 
quarter of 2021 to 29% in the first quarter of 
2022, while the share of loans granted at less 
favourable conditions increased from 18% to 
30% in the same period. By contrast, among 
non- energy-  intensive enterprises, the share of 
credit negotiations concluded at the desired 
conditions fell from 53% in the third quarter of 
2021 to 47% in the first quarter of 2022. In the 
same period, the share of loans granted at less 
favourable conditions increased from 16% to 
27%.
At the beginning of 2022, energy- intensive en -
terprises had smaller liquidity buffers than en -
terprises with low energy intensity. In the first 
quarter of 2022, around 21% of energy-  
intensive enterprises possessed liquidity re -
serves of up to two months, while 36% had In early 2022,

generally sufficient liquidity. By contrast, 12% 
of non- energy- intensive enterprises possessed 
liquidity reserves of up to two months and 
49% reported generally sufficient liquidity.
In the second quarter of 2022, enterprises were 
also asked about the impact they expected the 
Russian invasion of Ukraine to have on annual 
sales in 2022. In total, just under 15% of the 
enterprises participating in the most recent sur -
vey expected that the war would reduce sales 
by at least 10%. A further 20% anticipated a 
decline of up to 10%. By contrast, in April and 
May 2022, just under 7% of enterprises ex -
pected that the war would have a positive im -pact on sales figures. With regard to energy in -
tensity, energy- intensive enterprises anticipated 
that the war would have a much more severe 
impact on their sales figures than those with 
low energy intensity. Amongst enterprises with 
high energy intensity, 45% expected annual 
sales to decline in 2022 as a result of the war, 
with 24% expecting sales to decline by at least 
10%. By contrast, around 32% of non- energy- 
intensive enterprises expected sales to decline 
as a result of the war, of which 12% expected 
sales to fall by at least 10%.
In order to assess the direct impact of the Rus -
sian invasion of Ukraine, enterprises were asked 
whether they had had economic relations 
(trade, investment or production sites) with 
Russia or Ukraine in 2021. In April and May 
2022, just under 8% of the enterprises sur -
veyed answered this question in the affirma -
tive. These enterprises are significantly larger 
than enterprises without economic relations 
with either state (45% vs. 14% of enterprises 
with at least 50 employees) and were more 
likely to belong to the manufacturing sector 
(47% vs. 13%). Unsurprisingly, enterprises with 
economic relations with Ukraine or Russia ex -
pected that the impact of the Russian invasion 
would have a much greater impact on sales in 
2022. Around 26% of these enterprises antici -
pated that sales would fall by more than 10%. 
A further 29% of these enterprises expected 
sales to drop by up to 10%. By contrast, the 
share of enterprises with no economic relations 
with Russia or Ukraine that expected a drop in 
sales was 34%, with 15% expecting a drop in 
sales of more than 10%.
The impact of the war on enterprises’ demand 
for credit is also dependent on their economic 
relations with both parties to the conflict. 
Amongst enterprises with no economic rela -
tions with Russia or Ukraine, the increase in the 
share of enterprises that had initiated credit ne -
gotiations was moderate, rising from 13% in 
the fourth quarter of 2021 to 14% in the first 
quarter of 2022. By contrast, enterprises with

The impact of the November- December aid on the fi  nancial 
situation of enterprises
The German Federal Government imple-
mented various measures in the wake of 
the coronavirus pandemic to minimise its 
impact on the corporate sector. These in-
cluded, in particular, the suspension of the 
obligation to fi  le for insolvency, the exten-
sion of the period of entitlement to short- 
time working benefi  ts, the guarantee of 
bank loans via the special programme of 
the KfW banking group (Kreditanstalt für 
Wiederaufbau), and various emergency aid 
transfers for enterprises to compensate for 
losses of sales resulting from mandatory 
coronavirus containment measures. By May 
2022, the Federal Government had paid out 
more than €70 billion in grants as corona-
virus aid.1
A Bundesbank study investigated the im-
pact of November- December aid on the 
fi  nancial situation of enterprises during the 
lockdown of winter 2020-21 (see Gärtner 
and Marek (2022)). The BOP- F survey con-
ducted in February 2021 enabled quasi- 
experimental methods to be used for an in- 
depth assessment of the direct impact of 
the November- December aid on the fi  nan-
cial situation of enterprises. Specifi  cally, it 
analysed the impact of the support meas-
ures on liquidity reserves, employment ex-
pectations, investment decisions, and credit 
negotiations and their results. At the time 
the survey was carried out, a large share of 
the applications for November- December 
aid had not yet been processed. The effects 
of the aid transfers can thus be estimated 
by comparing enterprises whose applica-
tions were still outstanding with those 
whose applications had been approved. In 
the analysis, empirical matching methods 
were used to take account of enterprise characteristics that may have had an impact 
on the status of their application.
The empirical analysis suggests that enter-
prises whose applications for November- 
December aid transfers had been approved 
were 5 percentage points less likely to ex-
perience liquidity bottlenecks (liquidity re-
serves of up to two months). By contrast, 
however, there is hardly any indication that 
the provision of aid had an impact on em-
ployment expectations or investment activ-
ity. In addition, the study also shows that 
enterprises increasingly sought funding via 
bank loans if they did not receive any trans-
fer payments. The likelihood of entering 
into credit negotiations was 8 percentage 
points lower for enterprises whose applica-
tions for aid were approved. Furthermore, 
the results provide evidence that the trans-
fer scheme improved the creditworthiness 
of fi  rms. In this context, it can be shown 
that receiving aid increased the probability 
of obtaining a loan at the desired condi-
tions by about 14 to 18 percentage points.
Overall, the November- December aid 
helped to reduce the likelihood of more re-
strictive credit conditions that, in turn, could 
have exacerbated fi  nancial bottlenecks in 
sectors that were particularly affected by 
the pandemic.

states saw their credit demand rise significantly 
from 20% in the fourth quarter of 2021 to 
28% in the first quarter of 2022. In the first 
quarter of 2022, there was hardly any differ -
ence in the results of credit negotiations with 
respect to the enterprises’ economic relations 
with Russia or Ukraine. Amongst enterprises 
with economic relations with both countries, 
the shares of credit negotiations concluded at 
the desired or less favourable conditions were 
39% and 27%, respectively. By contrast, for en -
terprises without economic relations with these 
countries, these figures stood at 42% and 28%, 
respectively.
In the second quarter of 2022, the impact of 
economic relations with Ukraine and Russia 
was evident in enterprises’ expectations for de -
velopments in relevant enterprise metrics. Of 
the enterprises with economic relations with 
the parties to the conflict, 31% expected a de -
cline in sales and 38% expected an increase in 
sales between March 2022 and March 2023. In addition, 61% of these enterprises expected a 
deterioration in their access to intermediate in -
puts, while 37% and 16% expected a decrease 
or increase in short- term liquidity, respectively. 
For enterprises with no relations to either coun -
try, the shares of enterprises with declining or 
rising sales expectations for the reference pe -
riod between March 2022 and March 2023 
were 26% and 31%, respectively. Meanwhile, 
52% expected a deterioration in access to in -
termediate inputs. 28% and 15% of these en -
terprises expected a decline or increase in 
liquidity, respectively.
In the second quarter of 2022, enterprises’ ex -
pectations regarding their need for financing 
were shaped by their economic relations with 
Russia or Ukraine. 31% of enterprises with and 
27% of enterprises without relations with the 
parties to the conflict expected an increase in 
the need for credit financing between March 
2022 and March 2023. Despite differing expec -

differences in expectations regarding access to 
financing sources are extremely small between 
enterprises with and without relations with 
Russia or Ukraine. In the second quarter of 
2022, 19% of enterprises with and 18% of en -terprises without economic relations with the

* Monetary financial institutions (MFIs) comprise banks (including building and loan
associations), money market funds, and the European Central Bank and national central
banks (the Eurosystem).  1 Source: ECB.  2 In Germany, only savings deposits.
3 Excluding holdings of MFIs; for the German contribution, excluding German MFIs'
portfolios of securities issued by MFIs in the euro area.  4 In Germany, bank debt
securities with maturities of up to one year are classed as money market paper.5 Excluding liabilities arising from securities issued.  6 After deduction of inter-MFI
participations.  7 The German contributions to the Eurosystem's monetary aggregates
should on no account be interpreted as national monetary aggregates and are
therefore not comparable with the erstwhile German money stocks M1, M2 or M3.
8 Including DEM banknotes still in circulation (see also footnote 4 on p. 10●). 9 For
the German contribution, the difference between the volume of euro banknotes

Eurosystem and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  1 Figures are daily averages
for the reserve maintenance period ending in the month indicated. Following the
changeover in the frequency of Governing Council monetary policy meetings to a
six-week cycle, a reserve maintenance period no longer ends in every month. No figuresare available in such cases.  2 Source: ECB.  3 Includes liquidity provided under the
Eurosystem's asset purchase programmes.  4 From August 2009 includes liquidity
absorbed as a result of the Eurosystem's foreign exchange swap operations.  5 From
2002 euro banknotes and other banknotes which have been issued by the national cen-
tral banks of the Eurosystem and which are still in circulation. In accordance with the
accounting procedure chosen by the Eurosystem for the issue of euro banknotes, a
share of 8% of the total value of the euro banknotes in circulation is

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).

Sources: The calculations for the insurance sectors are based on supervisory data
according to Solvency I and II and for pension funds on IORP supervisory data and own
data collections as of 2020 Q1. Until 2019 Q4 these are compiled using Solvency I
supervisory data, supplemented by voluntary reports and own calculations.  1 Including
deposits retained on ceded business as well as registered bonds, borrowers' note loans
and registered Pfandbriefe.  2 Including claims of pension funds on pension managers
and entitlements to non-pension benefits.  3 Technical reserves "life" taking account oftransitional measures. Health insurance is also included in the "non-life insurance"
sector.  4 Own funds correspond to the sum of "Net worth" and "Shares and other
equity".  5 Not including the reinsurance business conducted by primary insurers, which
is included there.  6 Valuation at book values. The term "pension funds" refers to the
institutional sector "pension funds" of the European System of Accounts. Pension funds
thus comprise company pension schemes and occupational pension schemes for the
self-employed. Social security funds are not included.  7 Change in data sources.

* The effective exchange rate corresponds to the weighted external value of the curren-
cy concerned. The method of calculating the indicators of the German economy's price
competitiveness is consistent with the procedure to compute the effective exchange
rates of the euro. A decline in the figures implies an increase in competitiveness. The
weights are based on trade in manufactured goods and services. For more detailed in-
formation on methodology and weighting scale, see the website of the Deutsche
Bundesbank (https://www.bundesbank.de/content/796162).  1 The calculations are
based on the weighted averages of the changes in the bilateral exchange rates of the
euro vis-à-vis the currencies of the following countries: Australia, Bulgaria, Canada,
China, Croatia, Czechia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan, Norway, Poland,
Romania, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the
United States. Where current price and wage indices were not available, estimates were
used.  2 Includes countries belonging to the group EER-19 and additionally Algeria,
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico,Morocco, New Zealand, Peru, Philippines, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South
Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and United Arab Emirates. The ECB suspends
the publication and calculation of the euro foreign exchange reference rate against
Russian rouble with effect from March 2, 2022 until further notice. For the calculation
of effective exchange rates, an indicative rate is used for the Russian Federation from
that date. It is calculated from the daily RUB/USD rates determined by the Bank of
Russia in conjunction with the respective ECB's euro foreign exchange reference rate to
the US dollar.  3 Annual and quarterly averages.  4 Euro area countries (from 2001 in-
cluding Greece, from 2007 including Slovenia, from 2008 including Cyprus and Malta,
from 2009 including Slovakia, from 2011 including Estonia, from 2014 including Latvia,
