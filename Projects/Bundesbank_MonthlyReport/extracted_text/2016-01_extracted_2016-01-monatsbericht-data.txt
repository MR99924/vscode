Economic conditions
Underlying trends
Aggregate output again expanded at a steady 
pace in the final quarter of 2015. The rate of 
increase could have been similar to that in the 
preceding quarter. Economic growth continued 
to be sustained by domestic components, with 
buoyant consumer activity still being the driv -
ing factor. In addition, housing construction 
picked up considerable momentum. By con -
trast, industry did not experience a rebound in 
the final quarter of the year either. The signifi -
cant increase in domestic and export orders, 
which is consistent with the improved business 
outlook and the recent brighter export expect -
ations, does indicate that industrial output is 
likely to pick up in the near future, however. If 
crude oil prices stay at their current low level, 
the resulting gains in purchasing power are, 
moreover, likely to give a further boost to do -
mestic demand beyond the industrial sector. 
Opportunities therefore exist at the start of the 
year for stronger growth in economic output 
again.
According to the provisional calculations of the 
Federal Statistical Office, real gross domestic 
product expanded by 1.7% (1.5% after calen -
dar adjustment) in 2015. This means that the 
increase in aggregate output was roughly as 
strong as in 2014 (+1.6%). This was due to a 
remarkable shift of emphasis in the underlying 
driving forces, however. Consumption proved 
to be the engine of growth in 2015. Impetus 
came chiefly from the sharp rise in employ -
ment, clear increases in earnings, a reduced 
strain on budgets owing to low crude oil prices 
and additional government spending in con -
nection with the strong immigration of refu -
gees. External demand likewise provided fur -
ther stimulus. Nevertheless, there was a marked 
slackening in the pace of growth in exports 
over the course of the year – mainly to emer -ging market economies, but also to major in -
dustrial countries; as a result, German enter -
prises’ propensity to invest has been noticeably 
dampened and growth in industrial investment 
in the year as a whole was lower than in 2014.
Industry
The fourth quarter of 2015 saw no further 
growth in industrial output either. The Novem -
ber figure was ¾% down on the month after 
seasonal adjustment. This meant that the aver -
age for October and November was ½% down 
on the level of the third quarter. The decline 
was broadly based and affected intermediate 
goods (-¼%), capital goods (-½%) and con -
sumer goods (-1¼%) alike.
The intake of new industrial orders in Novem -
ber saw a further sharp month- on- month in -
crease of 1½% after seasonal adjustment. The 
average for October and November together 
was thus 1¼% up on the third quarter. This 
was accompanied by strong growth in domes -
tic orders and orders from countries outside 
the euro area (+1¾% in each case). There was 
little overall change in demand from the euro 
area (-¼%). This was essentially due to a com -
paratively weak placement of orders with the 
aircraft and aerospace industry, which generally 
fluctuates heavily and derives in part from non- 
euro- area countries. Excepting this, however, 
there was likewise a strong increase. There was 
a very sharp pick- up in orders for intermediate 
and consumer goods (+2¼% and +3¼% re -
spectively). In the case of capital goods, the 
volume of orders was barely up on the level of 
the third quarter (+¼%). Leaving aside large 
orders, there was also a marked increase. A 
major part in this was played by the fact that 
automotive industry orders recovered to a large 
extent from the slump in demand in the pre -
ceding quarter.Sound economic

Industrial sales in November fell sharply on the 
month (-2¼%) in seasonally adjusted terms. 
The average for October and November was 
thus slightly below (-½%) its third- quarter level. 
This was due chiefly to the fall in export sales, 
especially to non- euro- area countries. In terms 
of value, domestic sales held up at the same 
level as in the previous quarter, however. Nom -
inal exports of goods in November showed a 
slight seasonally adjusted rise on the month 
(+½%). On average, October and November 
were both down perceptibly (-1%) on the third 
quarter. At the end of the period under review, 
imports of goods showed a sharp month- on- 
month increase in terms of value (+1½%). Tak -
ing October and November together, there was 
a decline of 1% compared with the third quar -
ter, although the previous quarter’s level was 
maintained in price- adjusted terms.
Construction
Construction output in November showed a 
marked seasonally adjusted increase (+1½%) 
on October, the figure for which was substan -
tially revised upwards. This meant that, on an 
average of October and November, strong 
growth of 1½% was posted compared with the 
third quarter. The key factor in this was consid -
erably higher output in the main construction 
sector (+4¼%), with an almost equally strong 
expansion in general construction and civil 
 engineering. By contrast, the finishing trades 
– the data for which are generally subject to 
considerable revision – showed a marked fall in 
output (-1¾%). In seasonally adjusted terms, 
the intake of orders in the main construction 
sector in October (data are available up to 
then) were slightly down on their prior- quarter 
level.
Labour market

undiminished intensity in November. The sea -

Germany went up by 42,000 on the month, 
with the year- on- year rise amounting to 
423,000, or 1.0%, according to the most re -
cent figures. Employment growth is being sus -
tained mainly by newly created jobs subject to 
social security contributions, the number of 
which showed an extremely sharp year- on- year 
increase of 713,000, or 2.3%, in October. Ac -
cording to the provisional figures of the Federal 
Employment Agency, exclusively low- paid part- 
time employment fell again slightly, however, 
and was considerably down on its level in the 
same month of 2014. The downward trend in 
self- employment likewise continued. The Ifo In -
stitute’s and the Federal Employment Agency’s 
leading indicators for the labour market con -
tinued to rise from what was already a high 
starting level, which suggests that employment 
growth will go on increasing sharply over the 
next few months.
There was a further marked fall in the season -
ally adjusted official unemployment figure in 
December. At the end of the period under re -
view, there were 2.76 million persons regis -
tered with the Federal Employ ment Agency as 
unemployed, which was 13,000 fewer than in 
the previous month. The unemployment rate, 
as in November, was 6.3%. Compared with the 
same month one year earlier, 82,000 fewer 
persons were out of work and the unemploy -
ment rate was 0.3 percentage point lower. In 
December, the labour market barometer of the 
Institute for Employment Research (IAB) re -
mained slightly above the neutral threshold. 
Unemployment is therefore likely to remain 
stable or to fall slightly over the next few 
months.
Prices
Crude oil prices fell sharply at the end of 2015. 
Prices in December were more than 15% down 
on the month and, at less than US$40 on a 
monthly average for a barrel of Brent crude oil, 
hit their lowest level since late 2004. This was 
still roughly two- fifths lower than one year  earlier, since prices had also fallen sharply in 
December 2014. Prices were still going down 
sharply in the first half of January. As this report 
went to press, the price of a barrel of Brent 
crude oil stood at just under US$29. The pre -
mium on crude oil futures was US$3¼ for de -
liveries six months ahead and US$6¼ 12 
months ahead.
Import prices in November were down slightly 
on the month in seasonally adjusted terms; 
producer prices for industrial products in do -
mestic sales fell somewhat more strongly in 
November and December. This was due, above 
all, to declining energy prices. Prices of other 
goods remained almost unchanged. The year-  
on- year fall at the end of the period under re -
view narrowed to 3.5% overall for import 
prices; the figure for industrial goods, at 2.3%, 
was at much the same level as before.
Seasonally adjusted consumer prices fell by 
0.4% in December compared with the previous 
month. This was due, above all, to the very 
sharp price reductions for refined petroleum 
products in the wake of the lower prices for 
crude oil. Food products became perceptibly 
cheaper, not least owing to the mild weather, 
and price reductions for clothing and footwear 
were larger than in previous years. Other indus -
trial goods became markedly more expensive. 
Services, too, cost somewhat more, while there 
was hardly any change in housing rents. There 
was a slight decline in annual inflation as meas -
ured by both the national consumer price index 
(CPI) and the Harmonised Index of Consumer 
prices (HICP) at +0.3% and +0.2% respectively. 
The CPI annual average rate of inflation for 
2015 was +0.2%; the corresponding HICP rate 
was +0.1%. If crude oil prices become en -
trenched at the level reached in mid-  January, 
the consumer inflation rate will probably stay at 
a low level in the coming months – in contrast 
to what was suggested by the key assumptions 
underlying the December projection.Unemployment

Public finances1
Local government finances
According to the cash data from the Federal 
Statistical Office, local government core 
budgets and off- budget entities recorded a sur -
plus of just over €1 billion in the third quarter 
of 2015, compared with a deficit of €½ billion 
in the same period of 2014.2 Revenue rose sig -
nificantly (by 8%, or just over €4 billion), mainly 
as a result of higher growth in tax receipts 
(+8½%, or €1½ billion). (Net) receipts from 
local business tax and the municipal share of 
income tax recorded equally steep growth. 
Moreover, general purpose grants from state 
government, which are in principle coupled to 
the development of tax receipts, also increased 
(+4%, or €½ billion). The rise in other transfers 
from state government – partly made up of 
funds passed on from central government – 
was much higher still, at €1½ billion. Although growth in expenditure lagged behind that of 
revenue, it nevertheless recorded a marked 
 increase (4½%, or €2½ billion). Significant 
growth was seen in other operating expend -
iture, in particular, as well as personnel expend -
iture and social benefits. In the case of the 
 latter, spending on asylum seeker benefits 
doubled on the year (to just under €1 billion), 
while accommodation costs for recipients of 
unemployment benefit II (welfare- related bene -
fit) remained at the previous year’s level.
Local government budgets thus recorded a 
broadly balanced result for the first three quar -
ters of 2015, which equates to a year- on- year 
improvement of €2½ billion.3 Growth in spend -
ing on asylum seeker benefits is expected to 
accelerate once again in the final quarter owing 
to a massive rise in the number of incoming 
refugees during the second half of 2015. Fur -
thermore, it is likely that there will also be add -
itional spending on extra staff and other oper -
ating expenditure in this context, in order to 
plug the evident shortages. Even though the 
increased central government funds have not 
been used to further top up transfers from 
state government during the fourth quarter, a 
discernible surplus is on the cards for 2015 as a 
whole (2014: deficit of €½ billion).
Local government budgets could see a marked 
deterioration in 2016. Expenditure on asylum 
seekers looks set to continue to soar. Even

1 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain a detailed description of 
public finance developments during the preceding quarter. 
For detailed data on budgetary developments and public 
debt, see the statistical section of this report.
2 The Federal Statistical Office has announced that the 
data originally published in its press release dated 18 De -
cember 2015 (No 475/ 15) need to be corrected. For in -
stance, off- budget entities’ figures for sales proceeds have 
not been reported correctly, resulting in revenue being 
overstated by €800 million. The figures stated here have 
been adjusted accordingly. The Federal Statistical Office will 
present corrected data when it publishes the results for the 
fourth quarter of 2015.

higher than originally reported.Deutsche Bundesbank

ment will be raised in some cases as a result of 
central government increasing the funds it pro -
vides, overall it appears likely that local govern -
ment will have to draw on its own resources to 
a greater extent, at least on a temporary basis. 
Furthermore, the November 2015 tax estimate 
foresees significantly weaker growth in tax rev -
enue (not least on account of local business tax 
refunds following court rulings). However, cen -
tral government payments to state government 
in connection with asylum seekers could be 
somewhat higher still in 2017, inter alia  be-
cause a final settlement for 2016 is envisaged, 
as a result of which higher payments might 
be  made to local government. Furthermore 
– alongside burdens from tax refunds coming 
to an end – additional central government re -
lief measures will then enter into force, with 
higher transfers from turnover tax revenue and 
the assumption of a somewhat greater share of 
the accommodation costs for recipients of un -
employment benefit II. Central government 
would thus have already delivered on half of 
the pledge made in the 2013 coalition agree -
ment to provide local government with annual 
relief in the amount of €5 billion from 2018 on -
ward. Overall, the outlook for local govern -
ment budgets thus seems relatively  favourable, 
even though the increase in the number of rec -
ognised refugees will place additional strains 
on accommodation costs for recipients of un -
employment benefit II.
Debt attributable to local government core 
budgets and off- budget entities (including debt 
to other government sectors) stood at just 
under €151 billion at the end of September 
2015 and was thus up by €½ billion on the fig -
ure recorded at the end of June, despite an 
overall budget surplus. The rise was solely at -
tributable to cash advances (now €51½ billion), 
which are actually only intended to bridge 
short- term liquidity shortfalls. Although such 
 liabilities were redeemed in many federal states, 
the already heavily indebted municipalities in 
North Rhine-  Westphalia recorded a further in -
crease of almost €1 billion, having posted just 
a slight deficit in the third quarter. Credit mar -ket debt fell slightly overall to €93½ billion, 
while debt to other government sectors (in -
cluding social security funds) remained at just 
under €6 billion.
Securities markets
Bond market
In November 2015, the issue volume in the 
German bond market stood at €102.2 billion in 
gross terms (previous month: €144.5 billion). 
After deducting redemptions and taking ac -
count of changes in issuers’ holdings of their 
own debt securities, the outstanding volume of 
domestic bonds fell by €2.2 billion. Foreign 
debt securities worth €7.1 billion net were sold 
in the German market. Therefore, the funds 
raised from sales of domestic and foreign debt 
securities in the German market amounted to 
€4.9 billion.
The outstanding volume of debt securities is -
sued by domestic credit institutions decreased 
by €14.3 billion in the reporting month. There 
were net redemptions mainly of debt securities 
issued by specialised credit institutions and 
other bank debt securities (€9.6 billion and 
€6.4 billion respectively). By contrast, mortgage 
Pfandbriefe and public Pfandbriefe were issued 
for €1.3 billion and €0.4 billion net respectively.
Domestic enterprises also cut their capital mar -
ket debt in November (by €1.7 billion in net 
terms). On balance, this involved predomin -
antly bonds with a maturity of more than one 
year. The majority of redemptions were made 
by non- financial corporations (€0.9 billion).
The public sector issued bonds totalling €13.9 
billion net in the reporting month. This was at -
tributable primarily to central government, 
which issued mainly two- year Federal Treasury 
notes (Schätze: €5.2 billion), five-  year Federal 
notes (Bobls: €3.0 billion) and ten- year Federal 
bonds (Bunds: €2.5 billion). This contrasted

paper (Bubills: €2.0 billion). State governments 
issued debt securities worth €4.8 billion net.
Domestic investors were the only buyers of 
debt securities in November on balance. The 
Deutsche Bundesbank was the primary buyer, 
acquiring debt securities for €12.8 billion under 
the Eurosystem’s asset purchase programmes. 
Domestic credit institutions increased their 
holdings of bonds by €3.3 billion; this ultim -
ately involved exclusively foreign instruments. 
By contrast, non- resident investors disposed of 
German bonds worth €6.2 billion net. These 
were debt securities issued by the private sec -
tor on balance. Domestic non- banks sold debt 
securities worth €5.0 billion net, ultimately ex -
clusively domestic paper.
Equity market
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
placed €0.6 billion worth of new shares in the German equity market. The outstanding vol -
ume of foreign shares in the German market 
rose by €4.6 billion over the same period. Equi -
ties were purchased mainly by resident credit 
institutions (€5.6 billion) and foreign investors 
(€3.3 billion). By contrast, domestic non- banks 
offloaded equity instruments in the amount of 
€3.6 billion.
Mutual funds
In November, domestic mutual funds sold 
shares totalling €6.4 billion net in the German 
market (previous month: €8.2 billion). On bal -
ance, fresh funds were injected chiefly into spe -
cialised funds reserved for institutional invest -
ors (€3.6 billion). Among the asset classes, it 
was principally funds of funds (€1.9 billion), 
open- end real estate funds (€1.8 billion), equity 
funds (€1.6 billion) and bond funds (€1.2 bil -
lion) which recorded inflows. Foreign mutual 
funds sold shares worth €1.0 billion in the Ger -
man market in the reporting month. On bal -
ance, domestic non- banks were, by far, the 
main purchasers, adding €7.3 billion net of mu -
tual fund shares to their portfolios. Resident 
credit institutions acquired mutual fund shares 
for €1.0 billion net, while foreign investors sold 
shares for €0.9 billion net.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur -
plus of €24.7 billion in November 2015. This 
was €1.8 billion up on the October level and 
was mainly caused by an increase in the invis -
ible current transactions balance, which com -
prises services as well as primary and secondary 
income. Meanwhile, the surplus in the goods 
account narrowed, albeit to a lesser extent 
than the improvement in the invisible current 
transactions balance.

month to €22.7 billion. In this context, exports 
of goods fell more sharply than imports.
In the month under review, Germany recorded 
a total surplus of €2.0 billion in invisible current 
transactions, compared with a deficit of €1.5 
billion in October. This turnaround was mainly 
due to the fact that the services account deficit 
narrowed by €2.8 billion to €1.9 billion, which 
in turn was principally attributable to the 
downturn in travel expenditure typical for this 
time of year. On top of this, the deficit on sec -
ondary income fell slightly by €0.6 billion to 
€2.5 billion. Net receipts in the primary income 
balance remained broadly unchanged at €6.5 
billion.
In November, the international financial mar -
kets were influenced by the prospect of further 
monetary policy easing in the euro area and 
anticipation of an interest rate hike in the 
United States. Against this backdrop, German 
cross- border portfolio investment generated 
net capital exports amounting to €16.3 billion. 
This development was largely coloured by the 
demand for foreign securities by German in -
vestors (€12.5 billion). Resident investors pre -
dominantly bought bonds (€5.7 billion) and 
shares (€4.4 billion). Foreign investors parted 
with German securities worth €3.8 billion net 
in November. For the most part, these investors 
disposed of money market paper (€10.7 billion) 
and bonds issued by the private sector (€2.6 
billion) while acquiring German government 
bonds (€7.0 billion) and shares (€3.4 billion).
Direct investment likewise generated net cap -
ital exports in November, this time to the tune 
of €11.8 billion. Enterprises in Germany sup -
plied their affiliates abroad with funds totalling 
€20.0 billion net. This was achieved not just by 
boosting their equity capital (€10.7 billion) but 
also by increasing intra- group loans (€9.3 bil -
lion). Net funds flowing into Germany in the 
shape of direct investment came to €8.3 bil -
lion. Foreign investors channelled funds to

The impact of alternative indicators 
of price competitiveness on real exports 
of goods and services
Traditionally, a country’s price competitiveness plays a key role in its export performance. This 
raises the question – not least in terms of an adequate assessment of the economic situation and 
cyclical growth – as to which indicators are particularly appropriate in modelling price competi -
tiveness. There does exist a broad consensus that real exchange rates are a comparatively good 
reflection of the relative price or cost position of a given economy and are therefore suited as 
indicators of price competitiveness. What is mainly under discussion, however, is which price or 
cost index should be used to calculate it so that the indicator has a particularly close relationship 
to real exports.
All of the conventional indicators of price competitiveness have their own specific advantages 
and drawbacks. However, from a conceptual perspective, there is some evidence to suggest that 
indicators based on broadly defined price and cost indices may be capable of modelling price 
competitiveness more appropriately than more narrowly defined indices, since the latter capture 
price and cost developments only in some subsectors of the domestic economy. For example, 
indicators based on unit labour costs in manufacturing, which were once in widespread use, 
cover only one part of relative cost developments. This is not necessarily representative of overall 
cost developments in the German economy and can therefore easily lead to distortions and mis -
interpretations. Price and cost indices that focus on macroeconomic variables avoid this disad -
vantage.
This article presents the latest panel analysis examining the suitability of alternative indicators of 
price competitiveness as determinants of real exports of goods and services. It was found that a 
change in price competitiveness generally exerts a statistically and economically significant long- 
term influence on exports. However, it also came to light that there is often no long- term relation -
ship between indicators based on consumer price indices and real exports. Furthermore, the 
forecast quality of producer and consumer price- based indicators of long- term export perform -
ance proved to be relatively weak. By contrast, more favourable results according to various cri -
teria were obtained for indicators based on deflators of total sales, on GDP deflators or on unit 
labour costs for the total economy. This supports the above conjecture that indicators based on 
broadly defined aggregates for modelling price competitiveness are preferable for explaining real 
exports of goods and services.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
An economy’s international price competitive -
ness is one of the key determinants of its suc -
cess in exports. Not least in order to be better 
able to assess a country’s economic situation 
and cyclical growth, there arises the question 
as to the determinants of real exports and thus 
of suitable indicators of price competitiveness. 
As a measure of price competitiveness, various 
concepts of the real exchange rate are avail -
able. These chiefly differ with respect to the 
price or cost index used as a basis for calculat -
ing them. This article studies empirically 
whether one of these concepts is superior to its 
competing measured variables and should 
therefore be used as an indicator of price com -
petitiveness in preference to others.1
A systematic analysis of the quality of various 
indicators of the price competitiveness of the 
German economy may be found in the Novem -
ber 1998 Monthly Report  of the Deutsche Bun -
desbank.2 This analysis determined what im -
pact the conventional indicators of Germany’s 
price competitiveness and the volume of world 
trade had on real exports. This relationship was 
estimated for various competing measurement 
concepts based on unit labour costs in manu -
facturing, deflators of total sales, consumer 
price indices, producer price indices for indus -
trial goods, and the terms of trade. The study 
came to the conclusion that real exchange 
rates based on unit labour costs in manufactur -
ing can easily lead to biased results and that 
competing concepts based on broadly defined 
macroeconomic price and cost indices – such 
as deflators of total sales – are more appropri -
ate for modelling the price competitiveness of 
the German economy. Unit labour costs in Ger -
many’s manufacturing sector, in particular – in 
contrast to other sectors  – represent only a 
relatively small part of overall costs; in terms of 
their importance, costs of intermediate goods 
from other sectors as well as costs of energy 
and raw materials play a greater role. Addition -
ally, Germany’s manufacturing sector saw a 
sharper rise in unit labour costs than the other sectors during the observation period; as a re -
sult, there was a disproportionately large de -
terioration in the relevant indicator of price 
competitiveness. The debate on the suitability 
of alternative indicators of price competitive -
ness for explaining export performance is being 
revived in this report now that almost two dec -
ades have passed – a period characterised not 
only by marked trends towards globalisation 
but also by the establishment of European 
monetary union and the global economic and 
financial crisis.
The issue of indicator quality is examined first 
below in the context of general considerations 
and then studied with the aid of a panel analy -
sis. In the light of the aforementioned concep -
tual weaknesses of the relatively narrowly de -
fined indicator based on unit labour costs in 
manufacturing, this indicator is not included in 
the analysis; instead, the more broadly defined 
concept based on unit labour costs for the total 
economy is used. The study also covers indica -
tors of price competitiveness based on defla -
tors of total sales, GDP deflators, consumer 
price indices, producer price indices and export 
deflators.
Alternative indicators 
of price competitiveness: 
fundamental considerations 
and developments  
in Germany
Real exchange rates are measures of develop -
ments in the relative price or cost position of a 
country’s economy and are therefore typically 
used as indicators of price competitiveness. 
Ideally, these measurement variables should 
draw on internationally comparable statistical Position on

data, be calculated for all countries using the 
same method, capture all internationally trade -
able goods as well as the factors required for 
their production, comprehensively represent 
the price and cost situation and be available in 
near time.
The ECB has been calculating and publishing 
harmonised competitiveness indicators (HCIs) 
for euro- area countries since 2006. These meet 
the specified requirements in many ways. The 
published HCIs are real, effective exchange 
rates – that is to say, exchange rates calculated 
against a weighted average of major trading 
partners’ currencies based on consumer price 
indices, GDP deflators or unit labour costs for 
the total economy. To calculate them, the ECB 
uses the methods and data that are also used 
to calculate the effective exchange rates of the 
euro. In much the same way, the Bundesbank 
calculates competitiveness indicators for euro-  
area and non- euro- area countries based on dif -
ferent less or more broadly defined (and, in 
some cases, additional) deflators – such as de -
flators of total sales. The following consider -
ations show that the cited requirements cannot 
all be implemented simultaneously at present 
and are therefore not fully satisfied by any of 
the conventional indicators. The issue of indica -
tor quality will therefore be examined empiric -
ally below.3
The sales prospects of internationally active en -
terprises on the world markets are directly af -
fected by the export prices of these enterprises 
in relation to the world market prices of com -
peting enterprises as expressed in the same 
currency. However, the concept of an indicator 
calculated using export deflators is suitable for 
determining the price competitiveness of a 
given economy only if a change in the relative 
cost position or exchange rate adjustments are 
actually passed on in terms of export prices and 
not absorbed by a corresponding adjustment 
of profit margins. Focusing on the prices of 
goods that are actually traded and thus already 
successful in an internationally competitive en -
vironment excludes, a priori , sectors of the do -mestic economy in which tradeable but inter -
nationally non- competitive goods are produced 
that are only partly exposed to international 
competitive pressure owing, say, to a “home 
bias” towards domestic goods or to trade re -
strictions.
The use of producer price indices takes into ac -
count some of the drawbacks listed above. For 
instance, producer prices capture not only 
those export goods that are actually traded 
internationally but also the net prices of all 
goods produced in the domestic industrial sec -
tor, thus covering a wide variety of tradeable 
goods. Producer prices relate solely to indus -
trial products, however. Significant areas of 
global trade – such as the entire services sector, 
for example – are left out.
An economy’s competitiveness is likely to be 
captured better by focusing on domestic total 
value added rather than solely on industrial 
goods. The indicator based on GDP deflators 
models the price component of total value 
added, thus also capturing the domestic ser -
vices sector, which has played an increasingly 
significant role in the price competitiveness of 
the overall economy in recent years. The con -
cept of global value chains, which focuses on 
the increasing vertical specialisation in foreign 
trade, suggests the use of GDP deflators in cal -
culating indicators of price competitiveness so 
as to be able to capture price developments in 
intermediate goods that are in international 
competition.4
The indicator based on deflators of total sales 
takes into account not only domestic value 
added but also the prices of imported goods 
and services, which, in the case of imported … are taken 
into account in ECB and Bundes bank  calculations

intermediate goods, represent a cost compon -
ent of domestic output. This indicator thus fo -
cuses on an even broader price and cost base 
than the indicator based on GDP deflators. Not 
least in view of the major importance of inter -
mediate goods imports for Germany’s value 
added, the indicator based on deflators of total 
sales is frequently employed in analyses of the 
German economy’s price competitiveness.
By contrast, the indicator based on unit labour 
costs for the total economy captures only one 
part of the costs incurred in the production 
process. Changes in price competitiveness not 
due to domestic labour costs, but rather to de -
velopments in other cost components, are dis -
regarded. In addition, substituting production 
factors has an impact on unit labour costs, but 
not necessarily on the competitiveness of an 
economy. Despite these objections, a cost-  
based indicator also has advantages over price- 
based measurement concepts. For example, 
price- based indicators do not show a short-  
term deterioration in the relative cost position if 
it is being absorbed by enterprises by way of a 
correspondingly lower profit margin (pricing-  
to- market behaviour). Furthermore, price- based 
indicators can also be distorted by changes in 
indirect taxes, such as value added tax, if the 
tax is reimbursed when domestic goods are ex -
ported and hence no price effect is felt on the 
export markets.
Most of the aforementioned indicators have 
the disadvantage that, for many countries, the 
underlying data required for their calculation 
become available only with a time lag and are 
sometimes subject to marked revision. By con -
trast, the indicator based on consumer price 
indices is available for many countries in near 
time. Nevertheless, price developments in cap -
ital goods and thus a major part of foreign 
trade are, by definition, not included in the 
consumer prices. Aside from this, what is not 
captured are the prices of intermediate goods, 
which represent a major cost component of 
production, whereas non- tradeable consumer 
goods, which are not in competition with com -parable goods from foreign providers and may 
thus distort the indicator, have a large weight 
in the underlying baskets of goods. Lastly, the 
potential bias due to changes in indirect taxes 
mentioned in the previous paragraph is particu -
larly high in the case of consumer price- based 
indicators.
All in all, every indicator of price competitive -
ness has advantages and drawbacks. However, 
from a conceptual perspective, there is some 
evidence to suggest that broadly defined indi -
cators may be capable of modelling price com -
petitiveness more appropriately than narrowly 
 defined indices, which capture price and cost 
developments only in some subsectors of the 
domestic economy. Ultimately, there is no sin -
gle clear- cut answer as to which indicator 
should be used to assess price competitiveness; 
instead, this depends on how much import -
ance is attached to the drawbacks cited above 
under the specific circumstances.
Looking at the performance of indicators of 
price competitiveness in Germany compared 
with 37 trading partners reveals that the cited 
indicators all display quite a similar pattern. A 
particularly strong co- movement can be ob -
served in each case between indicators based 
on export deflators and producer price indices 
and those based on GDP deflators and defla -
tors of total sales. For example, all of the indi -
cators show that the price competitiveness of 
the German economy has improved substan -
tially since the mid-1990s as unit labour costs 
have been relatively favourable in Germany 
compared with its trading partners. The cumu -
lative improvement in competitiveness when 
using the unit labour cost-  based indicator is 
therefore particularly pronounced (around 28% 
from the first quarter of 1996 to the second 
quarter of 2015); by contrast, it is discernibly 
weaker according to narrowly defined indica -
tors based on consumer prices indices, export Unit labour costs 
only ever capture  
one part of 
 production costs

indices are avail-able in near time, but capital goods are not capturedFrom a concep-tual perspective, broadly defined indicators tend to be superior

deflators and producer price indices (at 21% 
and 20% respectively).5
Overall, the pattern displayed by movements in 
the indicators since the euro was introduced at 
the beginning of 1999 has been shaped by ex -
change rates against the currencies of non-  
euro-  area trading partners, which means that, 
in most cases, the turning points in trend devel -
opments throughout the observation period 
were reached at the same time. For example, 
on a weighted average against 19 currencies, 
the euro lost around 13% of its value in each of 
the two years following the launch of monet -
ary union and –  along with favourable unit 
 labour cost developments  – played a part in 
the marked improvement in the price competi -
tiveness of the German economy during this 
period. This trend improvement in price com -
petitiveness was interrupted, however, when 
euro cash was successfully introduced at the 
start of 2002, with the euro subsequently ap -
preciating by around 25% up to the end of 2004. The euro again came under considerable 
pressure with the escalation of the sovereign 
debt crisis in Greece, depreciating by 12% be -
tween the end of 2009 and late September 
2012. At the same time, the indicators under 
analysis show an improvement of 10% to 11% 
in Germany’s price competitiveness. Thereafter, 
the euro was buoyed by the stabilisation in the 
European financial markets and, by the end of 
2013, had appreciated by 7%. Indicators of the 
price competitiveness of the German economy 
show competition losses of 4% to 5% over this 
period. Since spring 2014, euro exchange rate 
movements have been shaped by diverging 
monetary policy developments on both sides of 
the Atlantic. All in all, the euro has depreciated Movements of

by around 10% since late March 2014, which has  
been reflected in a marked improvement in the 
price competitiveness of the German economy.
Alternative indicators 
of price competitiveness 
in advanced economies
Two alternative groups of indicators serve as 
the basis for a panel analysis of different meas -
ures of price competitiveness. One of them 
takes into account Germany together with all 
of the other original euro- area countries, as 
well as Canada, Denmark, Greece, Japan, Nor -
way, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom 
and the United States, ie 20 countries in total. 
The observation period in this case spans the 
period from the start of 1996 to the first quar -
ter of 2015. For this period, indicators are avail -
able for all of the above-  mentioned price and 
cost indices, each of which was calculated vis- 
à- vis a group of 37 trading partners. Such a 
comparatively broad group of trading partners 
has the advantage that it also includes China as 
well as central and east European countries, 
whose importance in international trade has in -
creased markedly over the past two decades.
Alternatively, the object of the study is a signifi -
cantly longer observation period from the start 
of 1975 to the first quarter of 2015. However, 
only indicators based on deflators of total sales, 
GDP deflators, consumer price indices and ex -
port deflators are available for such a long 
period, but indicators based on unit labour 
costs or producer price indices are not. Further -
more, it is only possible to examine indicators 
vis- à- vis 19 industrial countries, as many central 
and east European countries and China still had 
planned economies prior to the 1990s, which 
means that recorded prices allow no inferences 
to be drawn about their price competitiveness 
for that period. Lastly, the number of countries 
whose competitiveness is studied is reduced 
from 20 to 18 in this indicator group as the 
data required for later analysis do not go as far 
back as 1975 in the case of Greece and Ireland.For Germany, it was shown above that indica -
tors based on various price and cost indices dis -
play a similar pattern of movement. A simple 
correlation analysis provides initial clues as to 
whether such an outcome applies generally to 
the other countries under consideration. In ac -
tual fact, it turns out that different indicators 
correlate relatively strongly with each other at 
the cross- country level, too. The highest aver -
age correlation is shown by the indicators 
based on the deflator of total sales with those 
based on the GDP deflator. The lowest correl -
ation is generally between indicators based on 
export deflators with alternative indicators of 
competitiveness.
The comparatively high correlation between 
differently deflated indicators might point to 
their informative content being relatively similar 
with respect to price competitiveness. This 
would be the case, in particular, if indicator ser -
ies based on differing price and cost indices 
were cointegrated. A panel cointegration an -
alysis of any two given indicators does, in fact, 
show that indicators based on the deflator of 
total sales could be cointegrated at the cross-  
country level with indicators based on GDP de -
flators. There are hardly any signs of a pairwise 
cointegration for the other indicators, however. 
It may therefore be assumed that indicators are 
not fundamentally interchangeable in terms of 
their long- term impact on real exports.
The impact of price 
 competitiveness on  advanced 
economies’ real exports of 
goods and  services: a current 
analysis
The question of which indicator of price com -
petitiveness is particularly well suited to ex -
plaining the observed developments in real ex -
ports is being revived in a current empirical 
study. In contrast to the aforementioned earlier 
study in the late 1990s, the current study is not 
confined to Germany; instead, it includes a Two sample

larger group of advanced economies in the 
study in order to boost the informative content 
of the database and make it possible to draw 
more broadly based conclusions. However, this 
also implies that it is only possible to take ac -
count of country- specific conditions to a limited 
extent.
Empirical studies that estimate the impact of 
price competitiveness on real exports generally 
use a measure of real external activity as an 
additional determinant. For instance, Goldstein 
and Khan’s (1985) partial model of imperfect 
substitutes provides a theoretical foundation 
for such a specification.6 An improvement in 
domestic price competitiveness, ie a fall in the 
indicator, should therefore lead to an expan -
sion of real domestic exports – that is to say, 
the price elasticity of exports is assumed to be 
negative. Furthermore, an increase in external 
activity should fuel demand for exports; the in -
come elasticity of exports is therefore assumed 
to be positive.In line with the model, the two panels of alter -
native indicators of price competitiveness de -
scribed above are expanded for the empirical 
analysis to include export and external activity 
time series. Real exports of goods and services 
are used as the variable to be explained in this 
study. As a measure of external activity, export 
estimations in the literature use either real for -
eign GDP or partner countries’ real imports.

* The calculations for the observation period from 1996 Q1 to 2015 Q1 are based on indicators of price competitiveness from 20 coun-
tries. Each of these indicators was calculated vis-à-vis 37 trading partners. For the observation period from 1975 Q1 to 2015 Q1, indic-
ators from 18 countries are analysed, each of which was calculated vis-à-vis a group of 19 trading partners. First, the correlation coeffi-cient between two indicators was calculated for each country, with these being expressed in one case as logarithmic levels and as 
quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the other. The cross-country mean shown here was then formed from the correlation coefficients 
for a given pair of indicators.

effects in foreign trade, in R W Jones and P B Kenen (eds),

on foreign real income and a ratio of a domestic export 
price index to a foreign general price index expressed in a 
common currency. In empirical applications, this ratio is 
usually approximated with the aid of indicators of price 
competitiveness. See p 25.Deutsche Bundesbank

mon currency.7 This study uses five alternative 
measures of external activity. Below, however, 
this article will primarily address the results ob -
tained in the group formed over the short 
period, with global trade volume as a uniform 
measure of external activity for all countries 
(baseline specification).8
All variables are subjected to panel unit root 
tests in order to determine their time series 
characteristics.9 The tests all suggest that the 
series are integrated. A long- term relationship 
can therefore exist between them only if they 
are also cointegrated. Panel cointegration tests 
were used to verify this. In the baseline specifi -
cation, cointegration and thus also the exist -
ence of a long- term relationship between the 
three model variables can actually be assumed 
with a high degree of probability, irrespective 
of the choice of price competitiveness indica -
tor. In other specifications, evidence of the ex -
istence of a cointegration relationship is in 
some cases similarly strong as in the baseline 
specification, but in other cases also less so.
The cointegration tests can serve as a first key 
criterion for identifying which price competi -
tiveness indicator is particularly well- suited to 
explaining real exports. If, for a given indicator, 
no cointegration relationship exists between 
the indicator, real exports and external activity, 
there is also no long- term relationship between 
these variables. The relevant indicator would 
then be unsuitable for determining exports in 
the long term. Looking across all specifications, 
what is striking in the present analysis is that 
the tests for indicators based on consumer 
price indices suggest a cointegration relation -
ship in only very few cases. In the group formed 
over the long time period from 1975, irrespect -
ive of the external activity variable, we are in 
fact generally unable to confirm a long- term 
relationship between the variables for indica -
tors based on consumer price indices.10 Ac-
cording to this first criterion, all indicators, 
apart from those based on consumer prices, 
can therefore reasonably be used as determin -
ants of real exports.The plausibility of the estimation results is a 
second criterion for the suitability of an indica -
tor to be incorporated into an estimation equa -
tion of real exports. The long- term price elasti -
city of exports estimated in the baseline specifi -
cation is -0.37 on an average of the indica -
tors.11 This implies that a 10% deterioration in 
price competitiveness reduces real exports by 
3.7% in the long term. Such a value appears 
quite plausible and corresponds broadly to the 
findings of other studies on this elasticity.12In principle, 
a long- term  relationship between com-petitiveness and real exports of goods and  services is con-
firmed in the baseline  specification …

(2015), op cit.
8 The baseline specification was selected on the basis of 
various criteria. In the empirical analysis, the volume of 
global trade proved to be particularly well suited in this re -
spect insofar as, with this variable of external activity, the 
forecast quality was consistently the best and the evidence 
for a cointegration relationship was especially high. For al -
ternative specifications, see also pp 25-29.
9 Technical details on the chosen procedure and the results 
of this analysis and the analyses mentioned below are de -
scribed on pp 25-29.
10 For all other indicators, in contrast, a majority of the 
tests indicates cointegration if the group of indicators ob -
served over the long time period is considered. This is also 
consistent with the results of the integration tests, in 
which, in this group, there was the least evidence for the 
integration of indicators based on consumer price indices. 
However, if these indicators are actually stationary, ie not 
integrated, they cannot be cointegrated with other vari -
ables. Even in the baseline specification, there is the least 
evidence of cointegration when using indicators based on 
consumer price indices. Indicators based on consumer 
price indices also perform especially unfavourably in the es -
timations of T Bayoumi, R Harmsen and J Turunen (2011), 
Euro area export performance and competitiveness, IMF 
Working Paper II/ 140.
11 However, this applies only to a panel least square esti -
mate with fixed country effects. Alternative estimation 
methods yield somewhat higher price elasticities of up to 
-0.56 in the baseline specification. See p 27.
12 An estimated value for the price elasticity of exports of 
-0.37 is more or less identical with the average value calcu -
lated by Ca’Zorzi and B Schnatz (2010), op cit, somewhat 
higher than the value stated by the IMF (2015), op cit, and 
somewhat lower than the average value of Bayoumi et al 
(2011), op cit.Deutsche Bundesbank

The price elasticities of exports estimated in the 
present analysis range from -0.31, when em -
ploying indicators based on consumer or pro -
ducer prices,13 to -0.43 if using indicators based 
on deflators of total sales. The range between 
these values is relatively small. In no case do 
these results give cause for concluding that one 
of the indicators is unsuitable for determining 
real exports. This applies throughout even 
given alternative specifications. The second cri -
terion “plausibility of the estimated price elasti -
city” therefore does not make any contribution 
to discriminating between the indicators.14
The income elasticity estimated in the baseline 
specification is exceptionally stable at around 
0.8. The choice of price competitiveness indica -
tor has virtually no influence on this estimated 
value. It shows that, given a 10% increase in 
the global trade volume, the real exports of the 
economies under study increase by 8% on 
average in the long term. The fact that these 
results show real exports increasing, even in 
the long term, by a significantly smaller per -
centage than the volume of global trade is ex -
plained by the selected country composition of 
the group under study. In the observation 
period of the baseline specification from 1996 
to 2015, the percentage of emerging econ -
omies and transition countries in the volume of 
global trade showed a marked increase. The 
identified income elasticity reflects the fact that 
these countries are not included in the group 
of 20 advanced economies analysed here. 
Switching instead to the alternative, longer ob -
servation period from 1975 to 2015 and using 
trade- based foreign activity variables which, in 
this case, do not necessarily take into account 
the emerging market economies, results in in -
come elasticities which show real foreign im -
ports and the real exports from the analysed 
countries (approximately) growing in propor -
tion with each other over the long term. If, 
 finally, production- based variables are inserted 
for external activity, considerably higher income 
elasticities generally result because real exports 
have increased disproportionately to output 
over the past few decades.15A further indication of the suitability of an indi -
cator would be the accuracy of the customary 
assumption that exports adjust to deviations 
from the estimated long- term relationship and 
not, say, competitiveness or external activity, ie 
that the observed direction of causality is con -All indicators

13 Owing to the described weak evidence for cointegra -
tion when using an indicator based on consumer price in -
dices, the corresponding coefficients are to be interpreted 
with particular caution.
14 As a further criterion for assessing the indicators, their 
respective contribution to explaining real exports is often 
used. Analyses relating to just one country often initially 
compare just the relevant adjusted determination coeffi -
cients. However, they then usually also employ methods in 
which at least two indicators are included simultaneously in 
the export estimation and, consequently, statistically insig -
nificant indicators are eliminated from the equation. See 
for example, Ca’Zorzi and Schnatz (2010), op cit, Deutsche 
Bundesbank (1998) op cit, or C  Giordano and F  Zollino 
(2015), Exploring price and non- price determinants of trade 
flows in the largest euro- area countries, ECB Working 
Paper 1789. With the available data set, however, such a 
strategy does not lead to a systematic discrimination of 
 individual indicators according to some model calculations.

sistent with the theoretical considerations.16 
Using the baseline specification to verify this 
third criterion does, in actual fact, show that it 
is indeed real exports which undergo an adjust -
ment to the long- term relationship of the vari -
ables, irrespective of the indicator of price com -
petitiveness indicators that is used. Specifically, 
deviations from the estimated long- term rela -
tionship, which may occur due to changes in 
competitiveness for example, are reduced on 
average by 7% to 15% per quarter. The analysis 
does also point to adjustment tendencies of 
other variables, but their statistical and eco -
nomic significance is far smaller than those de -
termined for the adjustment of exports. In 
summary, it has to be noted that the third cri -
terion, too, is fulfilled to much the same degree 
by the various indicators. It therefore does not 
provide any additional clues as to the relative 
superiority of one of the indicators.
As a fourth criterion for assessing the various 
indicators of price competitiveness it is possible to use the precision with which, with the aid of 
the relevant indicators, real exports can be 
forecast over the long term.17 Such a check of 
forecast quality reveals, first, that the forecast -
ing error, irrespective of the indicator em -
ployed, is smallest if the global trade volume 
approximates external activity, as in the base -
line specification.18 The forecasting errors that 
occur when using alternative indicators show 
comparatively minor deviations from each 
other. It can, at all events, be stated that the 
forecast errors in models of the baseline speci -
fication using indicators based on consumer 
price indices and, in particular, on producer 
price indices are, on average, more than 5% 
higher than in the model with the smallest 
forecasting errors. Applying the fourth criter -
ion, it can therefore be said that these two in -
dicators are probably somewhat less suitable 
for using in an export equation than the others.
The economic significance 
of price competitiveness 
and foreign activity for real 
 export performance
In order to gain an impression of the economic 
significance of price competitiveness and of ex -
ternal activity for real exports, it may be useful 
to compare the estimation results for real ex -
ports of individual countries with the following 
two hypothetical scenarios. In the first scenario 
it is assumed that price competitiveness has re -
mained unchanged at its level before the escal -
ation of the global financial and economic crisis 
in autumn 2008; in the second scenario it is 
assumed that external activity has continued to Indicators based 
on producer and consumer price indices have somewhat poorer forecast properties

follow the trend of the preceding years.19 The 
first thought experiment shows that the slump 
in Germany’s real exports of goods and ser -
vices, which occurred during the crisis, took 
place independently of developments in Ger -
many’s price competitiveness. In fact, a sus -
tained improvement in price competitiveness in 
Germany did not set in until the end of 2009 
when the euro began to depreciate distinctly 
on average against major trading partners in 
the wake of the sovereign debt crisis unfolding 
in some euro-  area countries. The calculations 
reveal that this resulted in a growth rate for 
Germany’s real exports of goods and services 
which, during the period from the second 
quarter of 2008 to the third quarter of 2012, 
was 4 percentage points higher in the long 
term than in a scenario with unchanged com -
petitiveness, in which net export growth of 5% 
was, in any case, already shown in spite of the 
initial decline in exports. Following the in -
creases in competitiveness associated with the 
further depreciation of the euro since the 
second quarter of 2014, export growth for the 
whole period from the second quarter of 2008 
to the first quarter of 2015 is shown as 4 per -
centage points higher in the long term on bal -
ance than in the case of unchanged competi -
tiveness.20
The second thought experiment, quite unsur -
prisingly, makes clear that the decline in Ger -
many’s exports during the financial and eco -
nomic crisis was essentially due to the down -
turn in external activity. The model suggests 
that the slump in real foreign demand between 
the second quarter of 2008 and the second 
quarter of 2009, on account of the crisis, led to 
a long- term 17% decline in Germany’s real ex -Hypothetical performance of real exports

ports of goods and services, while exports in 
the hypothetical scenario of a trend increase in 
external activity would have risen. Since then, 
export activity has also not recovered suffi -
ciently to offset the losses which occurred at 
that time. Given continued trend growth in ex -
ternal activity, the long- term growth in real ex -
ports of goods and services estimated since the 
second quarter of 2008 would still have been 
26 percentage points higher in the first quarter 
of 2015 than the actual growth.
The two thought experiments may also be ap -
plied to other countries. The second scenario 
yields results similar to those for Germany. The 
first hypothetical scenario reveals that the im -
portance of price competitiveness for real ex -
ports is smaller in most euro- area countries 
than it is in countries outside the euro area. 
This is due to the fact that these countries 
show a relatively small variation in their compe -
tiveness indicators, since they typically conduct 
a major part of their trade with other euro- area 
countries, for which nominal exchange rate 
fluctuations are not possible.
Significantly, the first scenario shows for Ire -
land, in particular, where the share of trade 
with other euro- area countries is especially 
small, that price competitiveness has a rela -
tively large long- term influence on its exports. 
In some instances, the effects are even more 
pronounced in countries that do not belong to 
the euro area. The calculations show, for ex -
ample, that the deterioration in Japanese com -
petitiveness caused by the appreciation of the 
yen between 2008 and 2011, taken in isolation, 
reduced growth in real Japanese exports of 
goods and services by up to 8 percentage 
points in the long run vis- à- vis a scenario of un -
changed competitiveness. The simulations 
show that, taken in isolation, the strong depre -ciation of the yen since 2013, which was mainly 
related to the Bank of Japan’s non- standard 
measures to provide monetary policy easing, 
lead in the long term to a strong recovery in 
exports. As a result, export growth from the 
second quarter of 2008 up to the first quarter 
of 2015 is 10 percentage points higher than in 
the scenario where competitiveness is con -
stant. Calculations performed for Switzerland 
also suggest that strong changes in price com -
petitiveness can exert a marked influence on 
real exports of goods and services. According 
to the model, long- term export growth would 
have been 9 percentage points higher in the 
period from the second quarter of 2008 to the 
first quarter of 2015 if Switzerland’s price com -
petitiveness had not deteriorated since the 
 crisis.
Conclusion
Traditionally, a country’s price competitiveness 
is expected to play a key role in its export per -
formance. Our article explores the question as 
to which of the various indicators of price com -
petitiveness is particularly suited as a determin -
ant of real exports of goods and services. It was 
found for a panel of countries that a change in 
price competitiveness generally exerts a statis -
tically and economically significant long- term 
influence on exports. However, it also came to 
light that there is often no long- term relation -
ship between indicators based on consumer 
price indices and real exports. Furthermore, the 
forecast quality of producer and consumer 
price- based indicators of long- term export per -
formance proved to be relatively unfavourable. 
These results suggest that indicators based on 
broadly defined aggregates, such as the defla -
tor of total sales, the GDP deflator or unit la -
bour costs in the total economy are preferable.Impact of

Annex
Estimation of export 
 equations: methodological 
background and results
This annex provides a more detailed explanation of 
the methodological approach used to estimate and 
interpret the export equations referred to in the pre -
ceding article. Moreover, it presents additional re -
sults arising from the empirical analysis. That said, 
owing to the wide array of models examined, it is 
only possible to focus on a limited number of esti -
mation results here, too.
Before turning to the econometric approach applied, 
let us first take a look at the theoretical framework 
that was used to estimate the export equations. 
Here, use was made of the partial model developed 
by Goldstein and Khan (1985),21 to which reference 
is made in the main text.
Theoretical background, estimation 
 equation and database
Goldstein and Khan (1985) specify the function of 
real export demand X contingent on three nominal 
variables: the domestic export price index Px, the 
foreign price index expressed in domestic currency 
P*|S, and nominal foreign income expressed in do -
mestic currency Y’*|S. Assuming this original func -
tion is homogeneous of degree zero,22 real export 
demand can also be written as being determined by function g as
(1)     X=g✓Px
P⇤/S,Y0⇤
P⇤◆
,
where S denotes the nominal exchange rate in units 
of the foreign currency for each unit of domestic 
currency (indirect quotation). From the above, it is 
possible to derive the following export equation to 
be estimated
(2)   xit=β0i+β1rit+β2yit+✏it,
where xit is the log of real exports of country i at 
time t, rit is the log of the real exchange rate and yit 
is likewise the log of the variable measuring real ex -
ternal activity. Equation (2) is formulated here with a 
country-  specific fixed effect β0i and a country-  
specific residual εit. According to the theory, if an 
increase in ri corresponds to an appreciation in real 
terms in country i, the price elasticity of exports should be negative and the income elasticity of ex -
ports positive – in other words, β1<0 and β2>0.
In the empirical analysis, real exports of goods and 
services (EXP) are used as the variable to be ex -
plained. Real external activity y is approximated 
using five different variables. These are the aggre -
gate or weighted average real GDP –  in terms of 
relative purchasing power parities – of trading part -
ners (hereinafter AGDP and WGDP respectively), the 
aggregate or weighted average of real imports of 
goods and services by trading partners (hereinafter 
AIMP and WIMP respectively) or volume of global 
trade (GT).23 The real exchange rate r is expressed 
multilaterally using the six different indicators of 
international price competitiveness described in the 
main text, these indicators being calculated on the 
basis of the following price or cost indices: deflators 
of total sales (DTS), GDP deflators (GPD), unit labour 
costs for the total economy (ULC), consumer price 
indices (CPI), producer price indices (PPI) and export deflators (EXD). Generally, the same trading partners 
serve as the basis for calculating the external activity 
variable as those used in connection with the various 
indicators of price competitiveness. In the case of 
weighted variables, the weights are also consistent. 
Below, variable names shown in lower case denote 
the logs of the variables. In the empirical analysis of 
variables that are computed against the group of 37 
trading partners, quarterly data from the first quarter 
of 1996 up to the first quarter of 2015 are used. If 
the variables are computed against the group of 19 
trading partners, the data used go back as far as the first quarter of 1975.
21 See Goldstein and Khan (1985), op cit.
22 Typically, real export demand is modelled and estimated 
as a function of real variables. In order to arrive at a real

Empirical requirements for estimating 
 export equations
In the vast majority of studies estimating export elas -
ticities, Equation (2) is estimated in first differences 
on account of the non-  stationarity of the variables. 
However, this approach has two disadvantages. 
First, it primarily focuses on analysing short- term de -
pendencies between the variables. Second, such 
models may be misspecified and the estimators for 
the other coefficients can be biased if a long- term 
relationship actually exists between the variables. In 
view of these facts, we perform a panel cointegra -
tion analysis as set out by Bayoumi et al (2011), by 
means of which it is first of all possible to check 
whether a long- term relationship exists between the 
relevant variables.24 For this purpose, we make use 
of a test procedure developed by Westerlund 
(2007).25 Put simply, this procedure examines 
whether deviations from the long- term equilibrium 
are corrected by changes in the dependent variable. 
The approach is thus closely related to the logic ex -
pressed in the Granger representation theorem, ac -
cording to which a long- term equilibrium implies a 
correction mechanism in the event of deviations.26 The Westerlund test computes marginal significance 
levels ( p- values)  based on four different test statis -
tics, each calculated in a different way. The p- values 
based on two of these variants, namely the pooled 
and the group mean t- statistic, are shown for all of 
the examined specifications over the long observa -
tion period (see adjacent table) as well as for a selec -
tion of the specifications over the short observation 
period (see table on page 27).
A p- value below 0.05 signifies that the null hypoth -
esis of non- existence of a cointegration relationship 
can be rejected at a significance level of 5%. In the 
case of the pooled t- statistic, the test was geared to 
the alternative hypothesis that the adjustment coef -
ficient is negative for all countries; in the case of the 
group mean t- statistic, this is supposed to apply for 
at least one of the countries.27
Over the long estimation period, the tests suggest 
the existence of a long- term relationship between 
the variables at this significance level for the vast 
majority of the specifications, the sole exception 
being specifications where, irrespective of how ex -
ternal activity is approximated, the CPI is used in the 
computation of the indicator of competitiveness.28 
The results for the long estimation period and the 
corresponding panel composition thus speak against Westerlund panel cointegration tests*

24 See Bayoumi et al (2011), op cit. The results of several 
different panel unit root tests suggest that the variables 
included in the analysis really are non- stationary. It is only 
with respect to the CPI that the findings are ambiguous.
25 See J Westerlund (2007), Testing for Error Correction in 
Panel Data, Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics 69, 
pp 709-748. This approach is also used for the pairwise 
cointegration analysis of the various indicators of price 
competitiveness, the results of which are referred to in the 
main text.
26 Compared with “first generation” procedures, the 
Westerlund test method employed here has the advantage 
of taking cross- dependencies between countries into ac -
count using a bootstrap method. Non- inclusion of these 
could lead to the test results being biased.
27 A homogeneous adjustment coefficient is assumed 
across all countries for the pooled tests, while the adjust -
ment coefficients may be heterogeneous in the group 
mean tests. The tests were designed to have a particularly 
high degree of power with regard to the respective alterna -
tive hypothesis, making it highly likely that false zero hy -
potheses actually get rejected. In practice, however, it is 
often difficult to unambiguously interpret rejections of a 
null hypothesis as both tests exhibit power with regard to 
both alternative hypotheses.
28 This is consistent with the results of the panel root unit 
tests, which, in some instances, suggest stationarity of the 
indicators on the basis of the CPI. In this event, the indica -
tor in question would be unviable as a long- term determin -
ant of real exports, which are themselves unambiguously 
non- stationary.Deutsche Bundesbank

tions.29
Comparison of the results of different 
 estimators
The next step of the analysis consists of using three 
different estimation methods for the computation of 
the long- term elasticities. First, a classic least squares 
panel regression with fixed country effects (OLS (FE)) 
is deployed. The fixed effects of this regression ac -
count for time- invariant, country- specific determin -
ants that are not considered.30 Second, panel dy -
namic OLS (P- DOLS) estimations are performed. This 
estimator developed by Mark and Sul (2003)31 is an 
expanded version of the original dynamic OLS esti -
mator created for use with individual cross- sectional 
units. In this method, the model to be estimated is 
supplemented with lead and lagged values of the 
first differences in the explanatory variables in order 
to take account of any endogenous feedback ef -
fects. In Mark and Sul’s (2003) extension of the 
method to include a cross- sectional dimension, the 
estimation process occurs in two steps. In the first of 
these, the time series are adjusted for individual 
short- term dynamics and country- specific fixed ef -
fects.32 In the second step, an estimation is made of 
a cross-  country least squares regression of the “ad -
justed” time series.
Third, group mean panel dynamic OLS (GM- DOLS) 
estimations are deployed,33 which, in contrast with 
P- DOLS estimations, cast aside the assumption that 
long- term elasticities have to be uniformly homoge -
neous across countries. Should they in fact prove 
heterogeneous, this would indicate that –  strictly 
speaking – the two other estimators are biased with 
respect to the long- term elasticities to be estimated. 
By contrast, even in this case, the GM- DOLS estima -
tor continues to deliver a consistent estimation of 
the average long- term elasticity. The estimation pro -
cedure is likewise carried out in two steps. First, 
country- specific dynamic OLS estimations are made. 
Second, the respective mean values of the estimated 
country- specific long- term coefficients are calculated 
and interpreted as the average long- term elasticity.
The tables on pages 28 and 29 display the estimated 
results of the two panel compositions. However, in 
each case, they only show estimated results for spe -
cifications with a specific external activity variable; 
for the longer time frame, this is the sum total of real imports by a given country’s trading partners, 
whereas this refers to the volume of global trade in 
the case of the shorter estimation period.
The results highlight a striking similarity between the 
estimated long- term elasticities across the various 
estimators for most of the indicators over the short 
observation period. This applies both to the esti -
mated price elasticities and estimated income elasti -
cities.34Westerlund panel cointegration tests*

ally generates biased estimators for the remaining coeffi -

30 To avoid biased standard errors as a consequence of

robust standard errors according to J C Driscoll and A C

spatially dependent panel data, Review of Economics and 
Statistics 80, pp 549-560. Nevertheless, these should also 
be interpreted with caution as they were conceived for 
cases where the variables are stationary.

Method for analysing hypothetical 
 scenarios
In order to gain an impression of the actual eco -
nomic impact of the two explanatory variables on 
real exports in recent times, the main text makes ref -
erence to the results of an analysis of hypothetical 
scenarios. The method applied is described in brief 
below. The starting point of the analysis is the third 
quarter of 2008, that is to say, the quarter in which 
the US investment bank Lehman Brothers filed for 
insolvency and the financial crisis escalated on a 
global scale. An analysis of hypothetical scenarios 
consists of two steps. First, the baseline model is es -
timated.35 Second, based on the estimated coeffi -
cients, the dependent variable – in this case, log real 
exports – are forecast for a variety of values of the 
explanatory variables. In this analysis, the actual val -
ues observed from the third quarter of 2008 to the 
first quarter of 2015 for the explanatory variables are 
first inserted into the estimated model, which gives 
the forecast values of the dependent variable in the 
reference scenario. These are then compared with 
the real export values that would be generated by 
the model estimated in the first step if it were as -
sumed that the international price competitiveness 
of the country under review had not changed since 
the second quarter of 2008. The resulting differ -
ences between the two scenarios in terms of the 
forecast log real exports are thus attributable to the 
movements of the (log) indicators of international 
price competitiveness since the escalation in the fi -
nancial crisis. The same method is applied in a 
second thought experiment where, however, global trade is not fixed at its level recorded in the second 
quarter of 2008; instead, global trade is assumed to 
rise continuously throughout the forecast period in 
line with its trend growth rate in the preceding 
period.
Comparison of forecast quality based  
on iterative estimations
An additional criterion for comparing the suitability 
of the various indicators is provided by the forecast 
quality of the models based on these different indi -
cators. To judge the forecast quality of a given 
model, a certain number of the available observa -
tions are allocated to an estimation period, while the 
remaining observations are attributed to a forecast 
period. Since the actual realised values of the de -
pendent variable are also known for the forecast 
period, it is easily possible to calculate the forecast 
errors by deducting the values projected on the basis 
of the different models estimated for the predefined 
estimation period from the actually observed values 
of the dependent variable. The forecast errors for 
the various observations are subsequently aggre -
gated to produce an indicator of forecast quality.

35 The estimation is carried out using the least squares

first quarter of 1996 to the first quarter of 2015, based on 
the observed values of the variables. If, alternatively, the 
estimation is performed merely on the basis of the data

ture is the mean absolute forecast error. This is ob -
tained by calculating the arithmetic mean of the ab -
solute forecast error for observations made over the 
forecast period.
One fundamental problem presented by this kind of 
analysis is the often arbitrary choice of the estima -
tion and the forecast period upon which the relative 
forecast quality of the models ultimately also hinges. 
To avoid such arbitrariness, we apply a repeated 
sampling approach. To this end, one observation per 
country is omitted from the estimation period and 
this observation that is left out when estimating 
Equation (2) is forecast based on the actual values of 
the explanatory variables.36 This procedure is re -
peated until all the available observations have been 
omitted from the estimation period once and predic -
tions have been generated for each of them. In the 
literature, the method in question is referred to as 
the “leave one out” classification analysis.37 Next, 
the mean absolute forecast error of the respective 
model over the entire observation period is calcu -
lated. This procedure is repeated for all of the speci -
fications in order to pave the way for a comparison 
of the mean absolute forecast error for the various 
models. In this context, the model with the lowest 
mean absolute forecast error serves as the reference 
model, with the forecast quality of the remaining 
models being assessed in relation to this reference 
model. For the broad group of countries and the 
case where the volume of global trade approximates real external activity, the forecasts produced in this 
manner are most accurate when use is made of the 
indicator based on unit labour costs for the total 
economy. However, the mean absolute forecast 
error is just 1½% to 3% higher if use is made of the 
indicator based on EXD, GPD or DTS instead. Opting 
for either the CPI or PPI- based indicator leads to in -
creased quality losses, with the forecast error going 
up by around 6% to 6½% compared with the refer -
ence model.
The choice of the external activity variable, however, 
has an even greater impact on forecast quality. If 
Germany’s external activity is approximated (either in 
aggregate or weighted terms) by the real income of 
its trading partners, the mean absolute forecast 
errors are consistently higher than in a situation 
where external activity is captured using real imports 
(either in aggregate or weighted terms) or the vol -
ume of global trade, irrespective of the choice of 
competitiveness indicator.Long-term elasticities in 18 advanced economies estimated

Investment in the euro area
The economic recovery in the euro area has also seen investment regain momentum. Aggregate 
fixed capital formation is still languishing well short of its level prior to the crisis, however, though 
that was admittedly a period marked by above- average investment growth in some countries. 
Construction investment, in particular, had reached a magnitude in those countries that was not 
sustainable.
Fixed capital formation has also been trailing behind its longer- term average when measured in 
terms of the aggregate investment ratio in recent years. Gross fixed capital formation accounted 
for a mean 22% of gross domestic product (GDP) between 1995 and 2007, shrinking to less than 
20% by 2014. This decline was driven in part by a deterioration in financing conditions, a high 
degree of uncertainty and the need to deleverage. All in all, the macroeconomic environment 
was characterised by major adjustment processes, though some of these inhibitive factors have 
since lost significance. As a case in point, financing conditions are no longer as restrictive as they 
were in previous years, and macroeconomic uncertainty has eased. Positive impetus is also being 
provided by the Eurosystem’s accommodative monetary policy and by the key macroeconomic 
adjustments that have already been made.
While these factors can all be expected to shore up investment, the combined impact of macro -
economic activity over the past few years falling well short of earlier expectations and a bleaker 
growth outlook than just a few years ago is continuing to place a strain on investment. Viewed 
from this perspective, it cannot be said that fixed capital formation has generally been too low in 
the period since the financial and economic crisis. Indeed, the aggregate capital- output ratio has 
eclipsed its pre- crisis level in recent years, despite the drop in the investment ratio, which would 
support this notion. The key to boosting fixed capital formation, then, is to focus not so much on 
investment itself, but more on ways of sustainably improving the euro area’s long- term growth 
prospects. Rather than measures to stimulate the economy, what is mainly required here is a pol -
icy approach centred around strengthening long- term expansionary forces. A failure to do so 
would leave the investment growth rate – despite a cyclical improvement – mired at a subdued 
level over the medium term.Deutsche Bundesbank

Underlying investment trends
Activity in the euro area has been rebounding 
since spring 2013, and the same can be said for 
gross fixed capital formation. However, the re -
covery is making slow progress at best, even if 
it did pick up pace somewhat in the first half of 
2015. Real GDP had still not quite revisited its 
earlier high from the first quarter of 2008 by 
the end of the period under review and only 
exceeded its cyclical low from the beginning of 
2013 by 3%. Although growth of gross fixed 
capital formation has since been slightly 
stronger at 4½%, it was almost 15% down on 
its level immediately prior to the crisis. Invest -
ment, above all in machinery and equipment, 
may have resumed an upward trajectory in the 
majority of euro- area countries, not least over 
the course of the last year, but it is still lan -
guishing far behind pre- crisis levels in most of 
them. The shortfall is biggest in Greece and 
 Cyprus, at more than 70% and almost 60% re -
spectively, compared with a figure of 30% in Italy, Spain and Portugal, and nearly 10% in 
France. Just three euro- area countries, includ -
ing Germany, have returned to or marginally 
exceeded their pre- crisis levels.
A look at the aggregate investment ratio, ie ex -
penditure on gross fixed capital formation as a 
percentage of nominal GDP , likewise reveals 
the current sluggishness of fixed capital forma -
tion. At slightly less than 20% at last count, it 
was more than 3½ percentage points down on 
2007, and 2½ percentage points short of its 
average between 1995 and 2007. The global 
financial crisis depressed the investment ratio in 
a host of advanced economies, which is hardly 
surprising considering the weak growth dy -
namics,1 but in the euro area, additional factors 
may have been at play, most notably the poorer 
financing conditions, the spells of intense 
macroeconomic uncertainty, and the lingering 
debt burden that followed the predominantly 
credit- fuelled investment boom in the pre- crisis 
period.2 This was compounded by severe 
macroeconomic adjustment processes in some 
euro- area countries, which placed a consider -
able strain on domestic demand and particu -
larly on investment expenditure. In Cyprus and 
Greece, gross fixed capital formation dwindled 
to just 12% of economic output in 2014, while 
in Portugal and Italy, the respective shares were 
15% and 17%. This ratio was just over 10 per -
centage points lower than eight years ago in 
Spain and Ireland, standing at around 20% in 
both countries. Meanwhile, other euro- area 
countries, including Germany, saw almost no 
change, or they experienced only a slight de -
cline, as was the case in France.Investment on

From investment expenditure 
to capital stock
Investment performs two functions in the eco -
nomic process. First, it is a major component of 
aggregate demand. Second, investment is crit -
ical for maintaining or building up the capital 
stock, which is a key determinant of aggregate 
potential output. In addition, without sufficient 
fixed capital formation, the capital stock can -
not be renewed regularly, impeding techno -
logical advancements and hindering structural 
change in the economy as a whole.
Actual changes in the real capital stock cannot 
be inferred directly from the nominal invest -
ment expenditure recorded. Two points are 
worth noting in this respect. First, the charac -
teristics of capital goods change over time, 
often in response to technological progress. 
Second, price trends specific to capital goods 
can differ from those for intermediate and con -
sumer goods. Hence, a price adjustment is ne -
cessary which also includes a quality adjust -
ment. This is especially important in light of the 
rapid advancement seen in the information and 
communication technologies (ICT) sector. Offi -
cial figures reveal that the quality- adjusted 
price of ICT goods dropped by an average of 
2.6% per annum  between 1999 and 2014, 
while the GDP deflator saw growth of 1.7%. So 
even if the ICT investment ratio remains static 
or eases slightly, it is nonetheless possible for 
investment to grow in real terms. For other ma -
chinery and equipment, too, prices have risen 
at a much gentler pace than the GDP deflator. 
Machinery and equipment goods prices overall 
grew by an average of only 0.3% each year. 
One major implication of these price trends is 
that the investment ratio follows a different 
path in nominal terms than it does in real 
terms.3 ICT goods, however, have a higher de -
preciation rate than other capital goods on ac -
count of their shorter service lives. Owing to Dual nature

the increased significance of ICT investment, 
the aggregate depreciation rate has been on 
an upward trend in recent years.
Capital stock figures are not normally obtained 
through data collection, but rather calculated 
indirectly using the perpetual inventory method. 
This involves adding together price- adjusted in -
vestment expenditure over time and calculating 
separate capital consumption rates for each in -
vestment category. The capital stock increases 
when gross capital formation outstrips capital 
consumption. What this means, however, is 
that the capital stock actually available at the enterprise level is only recorded as an approxi -
mation.4
Tendencies by type  
of investment
The 2014 revision of the European System of 
Accounts (ESA 2010) differentiates between 
three key types of investment: construction 
(this is subdivided into dwellings and other 
buildings and structures); machinery and equip -
ment (including the components transport 
equipment, ICT equipment, and other machin -
ery and equipment) and investment in intellec -
tual property products.5 In 2014, construction 
investment accounted for just over 50% of ag -
gregate gross fixed capital formation in the 
euro area, followed by machinery and equip -
ment at around 30%, and investment in intel -

of research and development expenditures, which were 
previously treated as intermediate consumption that was 
completely used in the production process, as well as com -

Construction investment
The investment slump is most evident in the 
construction category, where investment has 
been following a downward trajectory since 
2008. The decline particularly hit housing con -
struction, but it also took its toll on other areas 
of construction – that is, commercial and in -
dustrial construction and the development of 
public and private infrastructure. Although 
construction activity has stabilised at a low 
level over the past few quarters (almost one-  
quarter down on the 2007 level), there is still 
no sign of a rebound. This huge reduction in 
construction investment sent its share of GDP 
from almost 13% in 2007 to 10% in 2014. Be -
tween 2002 and 2007, it followed a steady 
growth path.
The adjustments to housing construction activ -
ity should be seen against the backdrop of the 
pre- crisis boom experienced by some countries. 
There is a distinct negative correlation between 
the upturn in housing construction investment 
between 1999 and 2007 and its showing dur -
ing the 2007-14 crisis period. In Spain, Greece 
and Ireland, housing construction investment 
accounted for more than 10% of GDP in 2007, 
compared with a euro- area mean of 6% in the 
last 20 years. While the steep rise in housing 
prices in these countries will have undoubtedly 
contributed to this, a more significant factor 
was the sharp increase in housing construction. 
Real estate prices, which had previously risen 
sharply and seemed to justify the high housing 
construction prices, later buckled as an over -
supply of housing crippled the markets. On top 
of this came a deterioration in financing condi -
tions. The combined impact of these factors 
sent housing construction investment plum -
meting by 90% in Greece, 70% in Ireland and 
50% in Spain. Housing construction investment 
as a percentage of GDP contracted to 4% in 
Spain, 2% in Ireland and 1% in Greece, ser -
iously impeding local value creation and send -
ing shockwaves through these countries’ 
 labour markets. Both Italy and the Netherlands 
saw housing construction investment shrink by around one- third, while France suffered a de -
cline of nearly a fifth. Only Germany has seen 
housing construction pick up in recent years, its 
growth of 14% since 2007 largely being driven 
by the country’s brighter income prospects and 
the ongoing influx of immigrants.
Other construction investment (notably in com -
mercial and industrial construction as well as in 
infrastructure) also plunged across the vast 
 majority of euro- area countries. The steepest 
declines (of roughly two- fifths) were experi -
enced by countries that underwent major ad -
justment processes, including Italy, Portugal, Construction

Spain, Greece and Ireland. However, at -15% 
and -7% respectively, France and Germany, 
too, are still languishing far behind their re -
spective pre- crisis levels. It has mainly been in 
the crisis countries that fiscal consolidation 
measures have hindered investment in infra -
structure. A reluctance by businesses to invest 
in renewing and expanding their capacities is 
also likely to have been a factor.Investment in machinery and 
equipment and intellectual 
property products
Investment in machinery and equipment, which 
mainly arises in the corporate sector and is cru -
cially important for potential output, follows a 
clear procyclical pattern. A period of steep 
growth between 2004 and 2007 –  outstrip -
ping even the rise in construction investment – 
gave way to a slump when the global financial 
and economic crisis reared its head. A brief 
period of recovery was interrupted by the sov -
ereign debt crisis of 2011-12, which once again 
drove down spending on machinery and equip -
ment, though this contraction was admittedly 
milder than the one seen in the Great Reces -
sion. Investment in machinery and equipment 
has been back on the increase since early 2013, 
and spending was just over 10% up on the last 
trough as this report went to press. ICT invest -
ment saw the strongest growth in the machin -
ery and equipment category, having already 
surpassed its pre- crisis level in 2014. At that 
time, investment in machinery and equipment 
as a percentage of GDP , at just under 6%, was 
1¼ percentage points down on 2007, while its 
longer- term average stood at 6¾% of GDP .
Investment in machinery and equipment, then, 
has fared better than construction investment, 
both as a mean for the euro area and in the 
vast majority of euro- area countries. While 
many countries are still short of their pre- crisis 
levels, including Germany (by 7%), France and 
Spain (both by 10%), the trend towards in -
creased investment in ICT, in particular, has re -
mained intact. Only Italy, Portugal and Greece 
saw a fresh bout of very substantial declines in 
machinery and equipment investment during 
the euro- area debt crisis. Consequently, the 
gap between these countries’ current positions 
and their pre- crisis levels is particularly wide. 
Italy and Portugal are lagging by around 30%, 
while the shortfall in Greece is as high as 70%. 
But most countries will have seen their invest -
ment in machinery and equipment resume an 
upward path over the last year, if not before. Investment in 
machinery and equipment back on growth path since 2013

Indeed, growth rates were exceptionally high 
in some countries, Spain and Portugal being 
among them. In these countries, the reform 
measures have markedly improved local condi -
tions.6 In Greece, on the other hand, the first 
green shoots of recovery in machinery and 
equipment investment were interrupted by the 
turbulence in the first half of 2015.
Despite the weakness of investment activity 
overall, the structural change raising the profile 
of research and development and the atten -
dant accumulation of intangible assets con -
tinued. The pace of growth of investment in 
intellectual property products, which is largely 
confined to the (non- financial) corporate sector 
but also concerns the public sector, has merely 
slowed since 2008. In real terms, investment in 
this area exceeded its pre- crisis level by 14% at 
last count, sending its share of GDP up by 
¼ percentage point to 3¾%. Most countries 
follow a similar pattern.7 Only in a few isolated 
cases, such as in Italy, is this expenditure still 
down on its pre- crisis level. As a percentage of 
GDP , this investment has risen in most cases, 
with current figures ranging from 1½% in 
Lithuania to around 5% in France, Finland and 
Ireland. At 3½%, Germany is not far off the 
euro- area average.
Determinants of investment 
activity
From the perspective of an individual enter -
prise, an important determinant of investment 
is most likely to be the demand it expects its 
products to attract. This will also depend on 
changes in macroeconomic activity levels. As 
for housing construction investment, house -
holds’ income expectations will have a bearing, 
and they, too, are closely linked to aggregate 
growth prospects. The same can be said for the 
public sector’s projected revenue, which deter -
mines the scope of infrastructure investment. 
To illustrate the rather close positive correlation 
that exists between aggregate investment and 
growth expectations, one need only plot the annual growth of gross fixed capital formation 
against the economic growth forecasts for the 
following year.8 Other key factors are financing 
conditions and the availability of funds, pre-  
existing obligations and the ability to gauge 
 future developments.
Macroeconomic investment conditions have 
changed fundamentally since 2007. The global 
financial and economic crisis took quite a toll 
on the macroeconomic and financial environ -
ment, shaking the credit and property- fuelled Significance of

growth model that held sway in some euro-  
area countries to its very core. Problems that 
had piled up in the run- up to the crisis, particu -
larly exaggerations in the real estate markets, 
yawning external deficits and the loss of price 
competitiveness, prevented the economy from 
rebounding and moving to a new growth path. 
They also contributed to the outbreak of the 
euro- area debt crisis. A fresh recession was the 
direct consequence, even though extensive 
consolidation measures and reforms had been 
introduced.9 Overall, the protracted adjustment 
phase came at quite a heavy price in the form 
of unemployment and income losses. The eco -
nomic recovery that began to emerge in spring 
2013 remained tentative and lagged behind ex -
pectations, not least because of the at times 
cumbersome adjustment and reform processes. 
It was not until last year that the macroeco -
nomic outlook began to brighten up a little. 
However, the need for economic policy reforms 
is still considered a priority issue.10
Tightening of financing 
 conditions
The financial and economic crisis was accom -
panied by a tightening of the hitherto favour -
able financing conditions. This was reflected 
not so much in the lending rates as in the credit 
standards. Indeed, average euro- area house -
hold and corporate lending rates quickly top -
pled from the elevated level that had been 
reached during the economic boom. But the 
member states did not all benefit from this re -
duction in equal measure. Quite the opposite, 
in fact: interest rates diverged strongly, particu -
larly during the sovereign debt crisis. As a case 
in point, the spread between interest rates on 
new loans to enterprises in Italy and Spain and 
the corresponding German interest rates began 
to widen sharply in 2011 and only started con -
verging in 2014. A higher degree of intercon -
nectedness between bank and sovereign risks 
is likely to have been a key factor in the interest 
rate premium.11 Thanks to the monetary policy 
measures which have since been taken, interest rate conditions have, however, been very fa -
vourable for some time now.
A development that might have influenced in -
vestment more substantially than lending rates 
was the changes which banks made to their 
lending practices and their much more restrict -
ive credit conditions. In the financial and eco -
nomic crisis, this hit all euro- area countries to a 
similar degree; later, in the sovereign debt cri -
sis, its impact was largely confined to the mem -
ber states directly  affected by the crisis. The 
ECB’s Bank Lending Survey found that this was 
initially caused, above all, by a deterioration in 
financing conditions in the money and bond 
markets, liquidity shortfalls and higher capital 
costs. These factors later gave way to cyclical 
and demand- side factors, the survey revealed.12 
What is more, in countries such as Italy and 
Spain, heightened risks associated with loans 
to enterprises and large stocks of non-  
performing loans are also likely to have played 
a role.13 Credit standards in some member 
states only began to ease off somewhat over 
the course of last year. In comparison with the 
pre- crisis period, they remain, however, much 
more restrictive, particularly in some southern 
member states.14 Yet, the –  in some cases  – 
very favourable financing environment was 
probably a major reason for the excesses seen 
in the run- up to the crisis.
It is difficult to estimate just how far the tight -
ened credit standards have actually influenced Lending rates

investment. Although the credit volume initially 
expanded more slowly after 2008 and even 
contracted thereafter, this could also be down 
to weaker credit demand.15 In some member 
states, access to finance, particularly for SMEs, 
temporarily deteriorated.16 Particularly those 
enterprises which had previously been highly 
dependent on bank financing are likely to have 
found it difficult to tap alternative sources of 
funding. Investment projects are likely to have 
failed as a result.17 The reduced availability of 
loans for house purchase probably also damp -
ened households’ propensity to invest.
Larger non- financial corporations, however, can 
counter a deterioration in the availability of 
bank loans by seeking to make greater use of 
internal financing or alternative sources of ex -
ternal financing. During the global financial cri -
sis, non- financial corporations across the euro 
area as a whole saw their net borrowing pos -
ition of -2.3% of GDP in 2008 switch to a net 
lending position of +1.2% of GDP in 2009 on 
the back of a sharp reduction in investment 
 expenditure and lower payouts. Since then, the 
non- financial corporate sector overall has 
stopped funding its fixed capital formation ex -
ternally, and the recent expansion of investment 
spending has also been covered by internal 
 financing hitherto.18 It is reasonable to assume, 
then, that the comparatively low propensity to 
invest owes something to other factors.
Need to deleverage
Another factor inhibiting investment activity in a 
host of member states is likely to have been the 
high debt levels which non-  financial corpor -
ations and households accumulated during the 
largely credit- fuelled investment boom in the 
run- up to the crisis. As a case in point, house -
hold debt as a share of GDP climbed by 39 per -
centage points to 81% in Spain, by 34 percent -
age points to 87% in Portugal, and by 50 per -
centage points to 100% in Ireland between 
1999 and 2007. Debt levels rose in other mem -
ber states as well, but they generally remained comparatively moderate, such as in France and 
also in Greece at around 50% of GDP , and in 
Italy at roughly 40% of GDP . In Germany, house -
hold debt even contracted to 60% of GDP . 
Non- financial corporations likewise experienced 
mounting debt levels relative to GDP in most 
member states, with Spain and Portugal again 
running up the highest increases, at about 60 
and 30 percentage points respectively.Some impair-

The reappraisal of income prospects and the 
asset price correction that followed in the wake 
of the global financial crisis caused debt levels 
to bear down more heavily on enterprises and 
households, and led to a reassessment of debt 
sustainability going forward. The banking sys -
tem, saddled with huge stocks of non-  
performing loans, found it difficult to obtain 
funding, while enterprises or households highly 
indebted to banks proved to be particularly vul -
nerable to a tightening of credit standards. If 
these enterprises or households cannot fall 
back on suitable alternative sources of funding, 
they will have no option but to deleverage should they intend to use bank loans to fund 
future investment. However, the need to delev -
erage depresses economic activity as a whole 
and investment in particular. Funds generated 
are no longer available for investment but need 
to be used to reduce debt.19
The adjustment processes did succeed in redu -
cing debt levels, particularly in some of the 
countries affected by the crisis. Households in 
Spain and Ireland, say, scaled back their debt 
levels noticeably (by 10 and 15 percentage 
points of GDP respectively). Spain also saw the 
debt burden on non- financial corporations 
contract sharply, and in Italy and Portugal, too, 
the consolidation efforts did reap some re -
wards. Yet corporate indebtedness continued 
to mount in other countries. In France, corpor -
ate debt as a percentage of GDP climbed by a 
fifth to more than 125%. In Ireland, it even 
doubled to 200% (in Germany, it stagnated just 
shy of 60%). So while some improvements 
have been made, debt levels in the euro area as 
a whole are still fairly high. This would suggest 
that the debt burden will continue to dampen 
economic activity and the propensity to invest, 
at least in some member states, over the com -
ing years, particularly so if interest rates begin 
to edge upwards.
Uncertainty as a braking factor
Many believe the weak investment observed in 
recent years owes something to heightened 
uncertainty.20 The macroeconomic and political 
turmoil unleashed by the financial and sover -
eign debt crisis sparked one negative surprise Burdens due to 
high debt levelsDebt levels still high despite partial  adjustments

after the next. Prior to 2008, observers who 
could have imagined that a financial and eco -
nomic crisis of this magnitude was possible, or 
at least an immediate prospect, were probably 
very much in the minority. Its onset probably 
shook widely- held beliefs to the core.21 In the 
ensuing period, it was not always clear how 
other market players and politicians intended 
to respond to the new challenges they faced, 
and this probably caused macroeconomic un -
certainty to grow markedly. So bearing this in 
mind, it is only natural to adopt a wait- and- see 
attitude when decisions have a bearing on the 
future. Investment decisions by businesses are 
probably a notable example of this phenom -
enon.22
The uncertainty that has a bearing on eco -
nomic activity and particularly on investment 
cannot be observed directly, but must instead 
be suitably approximated. The indicator se -
lected here measures the extent to which eco -
nomic developments can be predicted (see the 
box on pages 42 to 44). That indicator signals 
that uncertainty was distinctly elevated in both 
the euro area as a whole and its four largest 
member states, and the reading was particu -
larly clear during the course of the global finan -
cial and economic crisis. Conversely, in the en -
suring euro- area sovereign debt crisis, the indi -
cator rose markedly only in the countries that 
were particularly affected by it –  Italy and 
Spain – while in France, it increased only slightly 
and Germany’s reading remained virtually un -
changed.

Measuring macroeconomic uncertainty and its impact 
on investment in the euro area
A common hypothesis in economic theory 
holds that uncertainty depresses invest-
ment.1 An empirical assessment of this rela-
tionship requires a quantifi  cation of uncer-
tainty. However, there are no objective, 
theoretically- founded measures of uncer-
tainty, only approximations.
Some of the commonly used empirical 
measures of uncertainty are built upon con-
ceptually very different methodologies. For 
instance, many of them capture the volatil-ity of certain key variables (eg stock prices
2) 
or the dispersion thereof (eg production ex-pectations
3).
Such dispersion and volatility measures are, 
however, also prone to capture develop-
ments that are not necessarily uncertain. As a case in point, the dispersion of production 
expectations might refl  ect heterogeneous, albeit certain (sector or fi  rm- specifi  c) ex-pectations. Equally, stock market volatility 
might increase without this being attribut-
able to uncertainty in the sense of an un-
anticipated change in macroeconomic fun-damentals.
4
More recent approaches to empirically ap-
proximating uncertainty focus directly on the predictability of economic variables in that they analyse a large number of data 
series in an effort to gauge the forecastabil-
ity of macroeconomic developments and, thus, the level of macroeconomic uncer-tainty. Specifi  cally, this initially involves de-termining the relevant forecastable com-ponent of the underlying macroeconomic time series with the aid of a factor model 
approach. The factor- based forecast is car-
ried out in two steps. First, statistical methods are used to bundle the informa-
tion contained in a multitude of individual 
indicators (the calculation includes both activity- related time series and fi  nancial 
market data) into a small number of factors. In a second step, the estimated factors are fed into the actual forecast model. Finally, based on the resulting forecast errors, a 
stochastic volatility model is applied to cap-
ture the individual uncertainty attributable 
to the corresponding macroeconomic time 
series. The measure for macroeconomic un-
certainty is determined by aggregating 
time- series- specifi  c uncertainty.5
An empirical analysis of the euro area’s four 
largest countries (Germany, France, Italy 
and Spain) shows that there are similarities but also important differences between the various measures of uncertainty. Specifi  cally, 
these measures are stock market volatility (SVOL),
6 the dispersion of production ex-
pectations in the manufacturing sector 
(EDISP)7 and a measure of macroeconomic 
uncertainty (MU) based on the non-

of stock indices derived from stock options are com-
monly used as a proxy for uncertainty. See N Bloom

rica 77 (3), pp 623-685.

aversion and swings in general market sentiment can 
trigger an increase in stock market volatility even if the 
assessment of macroeconomic fundamentals remains 
unchanged.

found in K Jurado, S C Ludvigson and S Ng (2015), Measuring uncertainty, American Economic Review 
105 (3), pp 1177-1216.6 Where available, stock market volatility (SVOL) is cal-
culated based on the implied volatility of country- specifi  c stock market indices, as derived from stock 
options. In all other cases, the actual volatility of the 
underlying price indices is used.

forecastable component of key macroeco-
nomic series.8
First, a comparison of the uncertainty indi-
cators reveals that all the measures in the 
four surveyed countries peaked during the 
global fi  nancial crisis of 2008-09. Second, 
simple correlations suggest that all three 
measures of uncertainty exhibit countercy-
clical behaviour with respect to investment 
activity. However, the measures of uncer-tainty also show considerable differences. 
The MU measure, which addresses the pre-
dictability of key variables, particularly 
stands out for showing the highest degree 
of persistence by far, while the other uncer-
tainty indicators are distinctly more volatile 
and sometimes display a signifi  cantly higher number of uncertainty episodes.

Structural vector autoregression (SVAR) 
models allow the relationship that exists be-
tween the various measures of uncertainty 
and investment to be explored in greater 
depth. The model specifi  cation chosen here contains six variables, each with four lags.
10 
These are the annual growth rate of the stock price index,
11 a measure of uncer-
tainty, a shadow short rate,12 the infl  ation 
rate, the unemployment rate and the an-
8 Depending on the country in question, the calcula-
tion comprises between 108 and 122 time series, in-
cluding cyclical indicators, survey data, fi  nancial mar-
ket series as well as prices and exchange rates.
9 The observed persistence of MU is consistent with 
empirical evidence for the United States. See Jurado et 
al (2015), op cit.
10 The specifi  cation and the ordering of variables in 
the SVAR model are based on Bloom (2009). The same applies to the identifi  cation of structural shocks which, as in Bloom (2009), is based on a Cholesky decompos-ition. See Bloom (2009), op cit.
11 The stock price indices used are the CDAX (Ger-
many), the SBF250 (France), the MSCI Index (Italy) and the IGBM Index (Spain).12 The shadow short rate (SSR) is intended to measure 
the degree of monetary policy accommodation when 
the policy rate is at the zero lower bound. In “normal” 
times, the SSR corresponds to the policy rate. See 
L Krippner (2013), Measuring the stance of monetary 
policy in zero lower bound environments, Economics

ment investment. The estimations are based 
on Bayesian techniques and refer to the 
period from the third quarter of 1996 to the 
second quarter of 2015.13
The robustness of the empirical results is 
tested using a multitude of sensitivity ana-
lyses, which reveal that the measure of un-
certainty designed to capture unforecasta-
ble components (MU), in particular, pro-
duces robust results regarding the impact of 
uncertainty shocks on investment.14 While 
the results produced by the other two measures of uncertainty (SVOL and EDISP) 
in the robustness analysis for the individual 
countries vary between distinctly negative 
and barely signifi  cant effects, the impulse- 
response functions for MU show that in-
vestment in machinery and equipment con-
sistently responds negatively to uncertainty 
shocks.
Measured in terms of MU, uncertainty was 
found to be high in all four countries under review during the global fi  nancial crisis of 
2008-09. Moreover, the MU measure points 
to mounting uncertainty in the course of 
the European sovereign debt crisis of 2011-12, fi  rst and foremost in Italy and to a lesser extent in Spain. This could imply that uncer-tainty during these periods had a signifi  cant 
bearing on the weak investment develop-ments in these countries. That being said, 
uncertainty has eased signifi  cantly in all four countries over the past two years.
13 An Independent Normal- inverse Wishart prior is 
used, with the hyperparameters being specifi  ed in line 
with the literature; see, for example, F Canova (2007), Methods for applied macroeconomic research, Prince-ton University Press. A prior distribution is specifi  ed for 
the coeffi   cients and diagonal elements of the covari-
ance matrix on the basis of estimated AR(1) models for 
each variable over a four- year sampling period (train-
ing sample).14 
Various model specifi  cations are considered (bivariate  
models, changes to the ordering of variables), alterna-tive investment measures used (investment in machin-
ery and equipment, industrial production of capital 
goods), and models based on different data frequen-
cies estimated (monthly and quarterly data). In add-

financial and economic crisis and the sovereign 
debt crisis (see the box on pages 46 to 48). Un -
certainty has since receded significantly, how -
ever. Predicting the economic environment 
now seems to have become easier again, prob -
ably because of the efforts to enhance the re -
silience of the banking sector and the stabilis -
ing effects of monetary and fiscal policy. 
Heightened uncertainty has not been a particu -
lar obstacle to investment of late.
Growth expectations dashed
The protracted spell of feeble economic growth 
has placed a strain on investment since 2008 
(see the findings derived from an estimated 
structural vector autoregressive model in the 
box on pages 46 to 48). Not only that, the out -
look for growth – a key factor for investment – 
has been revised downwards in recent years, 
not least because earlier expectations were 
dashed by the arduous adjustment processes. 
Evidence of this can be found by comparing 
IMF projections for euro- area economic growth 
with the actual outturns. European Commis -
sion and ECB projections would paint a similar 
picture, as would the results of the ECB Survey 
of Professional Forecasters or Consensus Fore -
casts. If medium- term projections from previ -
ous years are also factored into the equation, it can be concluded that, in 2015, the level of 
macroeconomic activity in the euro area was 
around 15% down on what had been expected 
directly before the crisis. The discrepancy in the 
case of Italy and Spain was particularly wide, at 
just over 20%.23 In hindsight, longer- term in -
vestments effected in anticipation of stronger 
activity probably turned out to be a bad move, 
or the investments in question were not utilised 
appropriately.24
From a macroeconomic perspective, this would 
manifest itself in a persistently elevated aggre -
gate capital- output ratio (ie the ratio of capital 
stock to aggregate output).25 The jump in the 
capital- output ratio during the course of the 
deep recession in 2009 was attributable to the 
irreversibility of fixed capital formation. The Macroeconomic

Determinants of investment activity in the euro area 
from the  perspective of an SVAR model
The development of aggregate investment 
activity is determined by a number of differ-
ent variables. These include factors affect-
ing the real economy, as well as the fi  nan-
cial market situation or the degree of 
macroeconomic uncertainty (see the box on 
pages 42 to 44). Structural vector autore-
gressive (SVAR) models are a standard tool 
in empirical business cycle analysis for iden-
tifying these drivers in the form of structura l 
shocks. In particular, by means of a histor-
ical decomposition, SVAR models make it 
possible to identify the relative importance 
of structural shocks for the development of key macroeconomic indicators.
In the following, a historical shock decom-
position of the growth in quarterly invest-
ment in machinery and equipment is carried out for the four largest euro- area countries 
(Germany, France, Italy and Spain). The SVAR model is estimated using Bayesian 
techniques1 and has a lag order of four. It 
encompasses seven variables: the annual 
growth rate of real gross domestic product 
(GDP), of the GDP defl  ator, of real invest-
ment in machinery and equipment, of real 
MFI loans to non- fi  nancial corporations and 
of a stock index,2 as well as a measure of 
macroeconomic uncertainty3 and a shadow 
short rate.4 The estimations are based on 
the period from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the second quarter of 2015.
Structural shocks are identifi  ed through the 
application of contemporaneous sign re-
strictions. This involves imposing qualitative 
restrictions on the impulse- response func-
tions so that the initial effects of the shocks 
to be identifi  ed are consistent with eco-
nomic theory.5 A supply shock, a demand 
shock, a monetary policy shock and an un-
certainty shock are identifi  ed. The shocks must satisfy the following restrictions. A supply shock leads to an increase in the GDP growth rate and a fall in the rate of infl  ation. By contrast, for a demand shock and an uncertainty shock it is assumed that the GDP growth rate, the infl  ation rate and the monetary policy interest rate all respond in the same direction. An uncertainty shock 
is set apart from a demand shock on the basis of the relative change in the growth rate of investment compared with the growth rate of GDP . In particular, it is as-
sumed that – in contrast to an expansionary demand shock – the reaction in the rate of 
investment growth is stronger than the re-
action in the rate of GDP growth.6 It is also 
assumed that an expansionary uncertainty 
1 Specifi  cally, an “Independent Normal- inverse Wishart 
prior” is used, with the specifi  cation of hyperparam-
eters in line with the literature; see, for example, 
F Canova  (2007), Methods for Applied Macroeco-
nomic Research, Princeton University Press. A prior dis-
tribution of the coeffi   cients and diagonal elements of 
the covariance matrix is specifi  ed on the basis of esti-mated AR(1) models for each variable over a period of four years (training sample).2 The stock indices used are the CDAX (Germany), the SBF 250 (France), the MSCI Index (Italy) and the IGBM Index (Spain).
3 The measure of uncertainty is based on the non- 
predictable component of key macroeconomic indica-tor series (see the box on pages 42 to 44).
4 The shadow short rate is intended to measure the 
degree of monetary policy accommodation when the 
key interest rate is at the zero lower bound. In “nor-
mal” times, the shadow short rate corresponds to the 
policy rate. See L Krippner (2013), Measuring the 
stance of monetary policy in zero lower bound envir-
onments, Economics Letters, Vol 118 (1), pp 135-138,

shock leads to a reduction in uncertainty 
and an upturn in the rate of investment growth.
7 A monetary policy shock is de-
fi  ned by a countervailing movement of the 
interest rate and the growth rates of both 
GDP and the GDP defl  ator. Below, supply shocks and demand shocks are subsumed 
under the term real economic shocks.8
The historical shock decomposition of in-
vestment in machinery and equipment from 
the estimated SVAR model shows the re-spective explanatory contribution of the shocks to the deviation of the investment 
growth rate from its unconditional mean.9 
The results suggest that both real economic shocks and uncertainty shocks had a nega-tive impact on investment in the four coun-
tries during the global fi  nancial crisis of 2008-09. In Germany, France and Spain, 
the negative contribution of real economic 
shocks to investment growth was compara-
tively stronger than that of uncertainty shocks. By contrast, in Italy the negative 
 effects of increased macroeconomic uncer-
tainty on investment in machinery and 
equipment were relatively stronger.
In the wake of the European sovereign debt 
crisis of 2011-12, real economic shocks 
played a notable role in explaining the 
negative development of investment activ-
ity, particularly in Spain and Italy. Macroeco-nomic uncertainty also hindered investment in both countries during this period. More-
over, a dampening effect of macroeco-
7 Under the identifi  cation strategy chosen, it cannot 
be excluded that the identifi  ed uncertainty shock also 
captures aspects specifi  c to investment and the fi  nan-
cial market. For details, see F Furlanetto et al (2014), 
op cit.8 Due to its small explanatory contribution, the mon-etary policy shock is not explicitly listed in the historical decomposition.
9 The contribution of an economic shock, at point 
in time t, to the deviation of the respective variable 
from its unconditional mean includes both present and past realisations of said shock. The illustrated contribu-
tions of the individual shocks correspond to the me-dian of the posterior distribution of the shocks from 
the Bayesian estimation of the SVAR model. It should 
be noted that the estimation uncertainty shown by the distribution is relatively high.Historical decomposition of the effects of economic shocks on the annual growth rates of real investment in machinery and equipment in Germany, France, Italy and Spain

capital- output ratio has more or less persisted 
at a higher level since then because fixed cap -
ital formation in the years thereafter was abun -
dant, relative to actual economic growth rates. 
Viewed from this perspective, an even lower 
investment ratio would have sufficed, if only 
because of the weaker growth.26 But this line 
of thinking might not give two points the at -
tention they deserve. One is that some of the 
fixed capital formed in the pre- crisis years and 
thereafter would have had to be adjusted for 
impairment losses owing to a lack of potential 
uses; the second is that the simplified calcula -
tion methods make the currently useable cap -
ital stock appear excessively high.
There is evidence that the aggregate capital-  
output ratio is persistently high in a number of 
member states as well, the differences in Italy, 
Spain and Portugal being particularly pro -
nounced. The ratio has also surged in France 
since 2007. Germany, meanwhile, saw its cap -
ital stock as a proportion of aggregate produc -tion swiftly retreat from its peak during the 
 financial crisis thanks to the quick recovery by 
the country’s economy and the – at times – 
 reduced investment ratio.
However, the longer- term growth expectations 
are probably more important for investment 
than a potential capital overhang. Various sur -
veys suggest that such expectations have sta -
bilised at a lower level. For one thing, the high 
level of structural unemployment is braking 
 activity, also over the medium term. Another 
important point is that, in a host of member 
states, structural barriers are inhibiting the ne -
cessary adjustments to the labour and product 
markets and dulling the positive impact of 
technological progress and innovation.27 Added 
to this, demographic prospects are becoming 
increasingly gloomy in some countries. Yet, … and in a 
number of  countries, tooMedium- term growth expect -
ations decisive for investment outlooknomic uncertainty can be found in Ger-
many, while uncertainty scarcely had any negative effect on investment in France in this period. In the past two years, the im-
portance of negative uncertainty shocks for 
investment in machinery and equipment 
has diminished in all countries.
Although investment was discernibly af-
fected by supply shocks, demand shocks and uncertainty shocks during both the fi  nancial 
crisis and the sovereign debt crisis, the his-
torical decomposition reveals that, to some 
extent, the other shocks also played a con-
siderable part in this. This can be explained 
not least due to the fact that, in relation to 
the identifi  ed shocks, the estimated SVAR 
model contains a large number of variables. 
These variables deliberately aim to cover 
additional factors that are potentially diffi   cult 
to identify, including, for example, factors 
specifi  c to the fi  nancial market such as credit supply shocks and stock market shocks,
10 as 
well as investment- specifi  c factors.Finally, it should be taken into consideration 
that the results are model- specifi  c. Diffi   cult 
to capture, yet potentially relevant factors such as inaccurate forecasts, credit con-straints or debt burdens could affect the  results if adequately taken into account. Furthermore, it should be noted that the historical decomposition does not reveal the specifi  c transmission channels of the identifi  ed shocks. It is, for example, con-
ceivable that the observed negative effects 
of uncertainty shocks are, among other things, attributable to existing fi  nancial 
market frictions.11

given an unchanged capital- output ratio, 
slower trend growth requires only a smaller in -
vestment ratio.28 The capital- output ratio itself, 
however, is related to the rate of return on cap -
ital. Hence, the current low real interest rates 
open up the possibility of lifting the capital in -
tensity of aggregate economic activity to a cer -
tain  degree.
Outlook
The spell of weak investment that has persisted 
for several years now in the euro area should 
be viewed against the backdrop of exagger -
ations and the build- up of massive macroeco -
nomic imbalances prior to the outbreak of the 
financial and economic crisis. The correction of 
these imbalances put a huge damper on do -
mestic demand and particularly on investment 
expenditure, especially so in some countries in 
southern Europe. This coincided with the pres -
sure to deleverage, more restrictive access to 
finance and surges in uncertainty, not least in 
the economic policy sphere. The retarding ef -
fects of these forces were not necessarily con -
fined to investment, however – employment 
and consumption decisions, and thus macro -
economic development as a whole, probably 
felt the pinch as well. This caused the euro area 
to fall short of its expected growth rates for a 
number of years. Viewed from this perspective, 
fixed capital formation which largely moved in 
line with expectations, has not generally been 
too low.
Investment has picked up again on the back of 
the economic recovery which began in 2013 
and has remained intact since then. Expend -
iture on investment in machinery and equip -
ment, in particular, has even risen steeply in 
some member states of late. The recovery looks 
set to continue in the coming quarters, since burdening factors such as restrictive financing 
conditions are no longer as effective as they 
were in previous years. Macroeconomic uncer -
tainty has eased considerably. Furthermore, im -
portant adjustments have already been made 
in an effort to reduce macroeconomic imbal -
ances. Even so, given subdued trend growth 
and in light of the above- average capitalisation 
compared with current activity levels, the pace 
of investment growth is unlikely to increase sig -
nificantly. It will only be possible to stimulate 
additional fixed capital formation if a lasting 
improvement is made to the euro area’s growth 
prospects. But that would call for a coordin -
ated package of measures to unleash the 
underlying forces of growth. Hoping for cyc -
lical factors and the effects of the accommoda -
tive monetary policy alone to provide the ne -
cessary stimulus will not suffice to sustainably 
improve the investment climate.View investment

The supervision of less significant institutions  
in the Single Supervisory Mechanism
The European Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), one of the central pillars of the banking 
union, was launched on 4 November 2014. It is intended to provide a key contribution to the 
safety and soundness of credit institutions and to the stability of the financial system in the Euro -
pean Union as well as each individual member state.
Unlike significant institutions, which generally have more than €30 billion in total assets and are 
supervised directly by the European Central Bank (ECB), less significant institutions (LSIs) continue 
to be under the direct supervision of the national competent authorities (NCAs). In Germany, this 
affects around 1,660 institutions which are jointly supervised by the Federal Financial Supervisory 
Authority (BaFin) and the Bundesbank. In this context, the responsibilities and tasks of these two 
institutions will remain unchanged. In particular, the Bundesbank is responsible for the ongoing 
supervision of institutions, and will therefore remain these institutions’ local point of contact in 
the future.
The ECB supervises the LSIs indirectly in the sense of an oversight function. The aim is to ensure 
harmonised high standards of supervision and a consistent approach within the SSM. These joint 
supervisory standards are currently being gradually developed by the ECB in cooperation with 
national supervisors. In addition, the ECB can prescribe supervisory priorities or principles on how 
to evaluate certain issues. In exceptional cases, the ECB can take over direct supervision if this is 
necessary to ensure the consistent application of high supervisory standards.
As part of its oversight function, the ECB can issue regulations, guidelines or general instructions 
to be implemented by national supervisors as well as recommendations to supervisors. Moreover, 
the NCAs are obliged to disclose certain information to the ECB. The ECB can, in addition, request 
additional information from the NCAs. The intensity of indirect supervision by the ECB is dictated 
by the priority of an institution, determined based on its risk profile and its impact on the domes -
tic financial system.
Taking stock of indirect supervision, now that the SSM has been in existence for slightly over a 
year, yields a generally positive picture. Quite a bit has already been achieved on the road to 
harmonised European supervision thanks to the close cooperation and intensive dialogue between 
the ECB and the NCAs. However, many challenges still remain. This year, a particular focus will be 
on further optimising the exchange of information and the coordination processes between the 
ECB and the NCAs. BaFin and the Bundesbank will work together to ensure that adequate atten -
tion is paid to the proportionality principle and the clear division of responsibilities between the 
ECB and the NCAs with respect to the supervision of LSIs.Deutsche Bundesbank

Supervisory approach
Creation and scope of the SSM
In response to the financial and economic cri -
sis, and given the progress being made in EU 
financial market integration, on 29 June 2012 
the European Union heads of state or govern -
ment took the decision to establish the SSM. 
This mechanism has centralised banking super -
vision at the ECB and represents one of the cor -
nerstones of the banking union.
On 4 November 2014, the ECB began to dis -
charge the tasks conferred upon it by the SSM 
Regulation. The legal basis for the ECB’s work is 
the Regulation conferring specific tasks on the 
European Central Bank concerning policies re -
lating to the prudential supervision of credit in -
stitutions (SSM Regulation).1 Although the 
SSM’s scope is initially confined to the euro-  
area member states, all other EU member 
states may “opt in” under certain circum -
stances. The SSM covers all institutions which 
are deemed to be credit institutions pursuant 
to the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR),2 
ie which take deposits and grant credit. It will 
also cover parent undertakings included in 
credit institutions’ scope of prudential consoli -
dation, including financial holding companies 
and mixed financial holding companies.
The SSM Regulation confers overall supervisory 
responsibility for all SSM institutions on the 
ECB. However, the ECB only directly supervises 
the 129 significant institutions in the euro area, 
22 of which are German. This is conducted by 
joint supervisory teams (JSTs) composed of staff 
from the ECB and the national competent au -
thorities (NCAs). Significant institutions account 
for over 80% of the euro- area banking sector, 
measured by total assets. However, if one looks 
at the number of institutions, it is clear that 
more than 96% of institutions, ie the approxi -
mately 3,4603 less significant institutions (LSIs) 
in the euro area, are still supervised directly by 
the NCAs and only indirectly by the ECB. Ger -
many’s small and medium- sized institutions, which number approximately 1,660, are thus 
also still supervised directly by BaFin and the 
Bundesbank.
As a rule, whether an institution is supervised 
directly or indirectly by the ECB depends on 
whether it is classified as significant or less sig -
nificant. The criteria and rules for this classifica -
tion are set forth in Article 6 (4) of the SSM 
Regulation and Article 39 et seq  of the SSM 
Framework Regulation.4
National responsibilities 
and tasks
Even following the entry into effect of the SSM 
and the amended version of the German Bank -
ing Act (Gesetz über das Kreditwesen) , LSIs in 
Germany are still jointly supervised directly by 
BaFin and the Bundesbank. Pursuant to section 
6 (1) of the Banking Act, BaFin is the national 
competent authority. It is responsible for super -
vising less significant CRR credit institutions as 
well as other institutions pursuant to section 1 
of the Banking Act which do not fall under the 
scope of the SSM Regulation.
Cooperation and the division of tasks between 
BaFin and the Bundesbank are governed by sec -
tion 7 of the Banking Act. The Prudential Super -
visory Guideline,5 issued by BaFin in agreement SSM is one of

with the Bundesbank, fleshes out the details 
with respect to day- to- day supervisory practice.
Pursuant to section 7 (1) of the Banking Act, the 
Bundesbank is responsible for the ongoing 
supervision of institutions. This is conducted in a 
decentralised manner by the Bundesbank’s nine 
Regional Offices, whereas the Bundesbank’s 
Central Office performs a coordination function 
and is responsible for policy issues. The Regional 
Offices are therefore still the institutions’ local 
point of contact. As part of a preventive, risk-  
based supervisory strategy, their primary re -
sponsibility is fact- finding, evaluating submitted 
documents, reports, annual accounts and on-  
site inspection reports and holding regular and 
ad hoc  discussions with senior management. In 
addition, they are obliged to create, at least 
once a year, a comprehensive risk classification 
and assessment as part of the supervisory re -
view and evaluation process (SREP) for each in -
stitution (the supervisory risk profile). On this 
basis, they give BaFin proposals for supervisory 
action, where necessary. BaFin is responsible for 
finalising the risk profiles and taking decisions 
on supervisory measures and actions. Ongoing 
supervision also encompasses the performance 
by supervisors of on- site inspections at institu -
tions pursuant to section 44 of the Banking Act; 
these are likewise usually conducted by the 
Bundesbank’s Regional Offices. The main pur -pose of these inspections is to assess the institu -
tions’ risk management and the internal models 
used to calculate capital requirements.
Scope and design of indirect 
supervision
Aims and major instruments
In their capacity as direct supervisors of LSIs, 
the NCAs are still the recipients of reports and 
the institutions’ direct point of contact. Small 
and medium- sized institutions’ direct contact 
with the ECB is thus limited to exceptional 
cases. The respective country’s national lan -
guage likewise remains the official language 
for communications with institutions, and na -
tional accounting standards (eg the German 
Commercial Code) continue to apply.
In its indirect supervision of LSIs, the ECB takes 
on an oversight function. The ECB not only 
oversees the NCAs’ supervisory activities, but 
also has an overview of all LSIs.
The SSM Regulation gives the ECB a variety of 
powers over the NCAs to allow it to perform its 
oversight function effectively. For instance, the 
ECB can, under Article 6 (5) (a) of the SSM 
Regulation, issue regulations, guidelines or Bundesbank is

Issuance of 
regulations, guidelines, instructions and recommenda-tions by the ECBCriteria for identifying signifi  cant institutions pursuant to Article 6 (4) of the SSM Regulation and Article 39 et seq of the SSM Framework Regulation
 
A credit institution shall be considered signifi  cant if any of the following conditions are met.
The total value of its assets exceeds €30 billion.
The ratio of its total assets over the GDP of the participating member state of establishment exceeds 20%, 
unless the total value of its assets is below €5 billion.
Public fi  nancial assistance has been requested or received directly for the institution from the EFSF1 or the ESM.2
The institution is one of the three most signifi  cant credit institutions in the participating member state.
The national competent authority has stated that it considers the institution to be signifi  cant with regard to the domestic economy, 
and the ECB has confi  rmed the assessment.
Moreover, the ECB may, on its own initiative, decide to classify a supervised group as signifi  cant if the parent undertaking 
has established subsidiaries, which are themselves credit institutions, in more than one participating member state and
– the total value of the group’s assets exceeds €5 billion and
– the ratio of its cross- border assets/liabilities to total assets/liabilities exceeds 20%.

general instructions, which the NCAs are re -
quired to implement. The ECB can also issue 
non- binding recommendations to supervisors.
Moreover, Article 6 (2) of the SSM Regulation 
subjects both the ECB and national supervisors 
to a duty of cooperation in good faith and an 
obligation to exchange information. To this 
end, the NCAs shall provide information to the 
ECB through regular reports. Where necessary, 
the ECB can request additional information and 
conduct relevant analyses. Such analyses also 
include thematic reviews designed to provide a 
targeted insight into the NCAs’ supervision of 
predefined risk areas at the level of single en -
tities or groups of comparable entities.
The aim of oversight is to ensure high standards 
of supervision in the sense of a best- practice ap -
proach as well as a consistent procedure within 
the SSM. These joint supervisory standards are 
being gradually developed by the ECB in co -
operation with the NCAs. Moreover, the ECB 
may also set supervisory priorities or define prin -
ciples on how to evaluate certain issues. What 
the ECB cannot do, however, is to issue individ -
ual instructions relating to a specific LSI.
The ECB is required to observe the principle of 
proportionality at all times in its activities. What 
this means is that the ECB’s oversight and ana -lytical activities as well as its framework for har -
monising supervisory practices in indirect 
supervision must, in terms of scope and applic -
ability, take due account of the diversity of in -
stitutions in the SSM, their size and their busi -
ness models.
The ECB’s indirect supervision can result not 
only in effects for NCAs; there may also be dir -
ect consequences for institutions. Last year, this 
was the case, for instance, for the ECB’s rec -
ommendation on dividend distribution policies 
in order to ensure sustainable compliance with 
capital requirements, which BaFin, in accord -
ance with the ECB recommendation, also ad -
dressed to LSIs in May 2015.6
Pursuant to Article 6 (6) of the SSM Regulation, 
the NCAs are still responsible for on- site inspec -
tions of banking operations, though the ECB is 
permitted to send observers.
Finally, Article 6 (5) (b) of the SSM Regulation 
entitles the ECB, as a last resort, to assume dir -
ect supervision over an LSI should this be ne -
cessary to ensure the consistent application of 
high supervisory standards.Regular and ad

Irrespective of whether an institution is classi -
fied as significant or less significant, there are 
three areas in which common procedures are 
conducted, ie the ECB and the NCAs cooper -
ate, though the decisions are taken by the ECB 
(Article 73 et seq  of the SSM Framework Regu -
lation). These include the decision on approv -
ing applications for authorisation to take up 
the business of a credit institution and with -
drawing such authorisation (Article 14 of the 
SSM Regulation) as well as on the acquisition 
of a qualifying holding in a credit institution 
(Article 15 of the SSM Regulation).
Prioritisation of LSIs
The LSIs in the SSM are highly diverse in terms 
of size, risks and structure, as well as in the 
 nature, scope and complexity of their business 
activities. In order to do justice to this hetero -
geneous structure, the principle of proportion -
ality represents a guiding principle of the ECB’s 
indirect supervision, much as in the supervisory 
approach in use at present in Germany.
The ECB has been pursuing a graduated ap -
proach, one that centres on prioritising institu -
tions, as a way of implementing the principle of 
proportionality. It assigns one of three priority 
ranks (high, medium, or low priority) to institu -
tions. The prioritisation process is conducted 
annually. Whereas the 2015 review was still 
conducted on the basis of relatively rough, sim -
plified criteria, the ECB has now, in cooperation 
with the NCAs, developed a comprehensive 
prioritisation methodology, which was already 
used for the prioritisation for 2016.
The methodology is initially aimed at a quanti -
tative analysis of an institution’s priority. It looks 
not only at the institution’s intrinsic riskiness 
based on the SREP assessment and/or risk pro -
file, but also at the impact an institution has on 
its domestic financial system as criteria for clas -
sification.Moreover, the methodology defines certain 
catch- all provisions. Thus, institutions whose 
total assets are relatively close to the signifi -
cance threshold pursuant to Article 6 (4) of the 
SSM Regulation are also ranked as high- priority. 
This is intended to ensure that the ECB has suf -
ficient information on those institutions that 
could potentially become significant in the 
 future and would therefore fall under its direct 
supervision, irrespective of their specific riski -
ness. By contrast, institutions with a relatively 
small impact on the domestic financial system 
are generally ranked only medium- priority or 
low- priority.
Prioritisation is finalised after a dialogue be -
tween the ECB and the NCAs on the respective 
institutions, which incorporates qualitative as -
sessments from the NCAs and takes into ac -
count any new developments.
An institution’s ranking in the various categor -
ies affects the intensity with which the ECB ex -
ercises indirect supervision. For instance, the 
priority determines the extent and frequency of 
NCAs’ reporting requirements or the ECB’s 
 requests for additional information. It also 
guides the NCAs’ internal processes and activ -
ities.Common pro-

Requirements for reporting 
 information to the ECB
Under the division of tasks in the SSM between 
the NCAs, which supervise LSIs directly, and the 
ECB, which supervises LSIs indirectly, the NCAs 
are required to submit certain information to 
the ECB. Article 6 (2) of the SSM Regulation 
stipulates that the NCAs must provide the ECB 
with all the information the latter needs to 
carry out the tasks conferred upon it. Another 
purpose of the reporting requirements is to 
keep the ECB apprised of major developments, 
information which it can use as the basis for its 
own analyses of sectors or important single en -
tities.
The reporting requirements are directed exclu -
sively at the NCAs and not the institutions. The 
supervisors shall compile the requisite informa -
tion in the course of their normal supervisory 
 activities and communicate it to the ECB in the 
form of standardised notifications. Moreover, 
the ECB regularly receives all data reported to 
the NCAs as part of the regular supervisory re -
porting system pursuant to the provisions of 
the CRR and the European Commission’s im -
plementing regulation laying down implement -
ing technical standards with regard to supervis -
ory reporting of institutions,7 which is based on 
the CRR.
Articles 96 to 100 of the SSM Framework 
Regulation define the procedures, including the 
applicable deadlines. They classify notification 
requirements into the following categories: ex 
ante notifications, ex post  notifications and 
other notifications.
Ex ante  notifications
Pursuant to Articles 97 and 98 of the SSM 
Framework Regulation, the NCAs are required 
to communicate material supervisory proced -
ures and material draft supervisory decisions to 
the ECB. These reporting requirements apply 
only to high- priority institutions.Irrespective of an institution’s priority, Article 
97 (4) and Article 98 (3) of the SSM Framework 
Regulation stipulate that the NCAs must notify 
the ECB of those procedures or draft decisions 
which they deem material, which could nega -
tively affect the stability or reputation of the 
SSM, or on which the ECB’s views are sought. 
The purpose behind all these notifications is to 
give the ECB the opportunity to pass comment 
prior to the NCA’s final decision, without hav -
ing any binding effect on the NCA.
Ex post  reporting
Pursuant to Article 99 of the SSM Framework 
Regulation, NCAs shall regularly forward 
institution- specific information to the ECB. This 
reporting requirement covers all LSIs, though 
the frequency of the reports depends on the 
priority ranking.
Article 100 of the SSM Framework Regulation 
states that NCAs must report annually on their 
activities in the supervision of LSIs. The report 
shall contain quantitative and qualitative infor -
mation on the national banking sector, the 
supervisory process, and organisational as -
pects.
Other notifications
There are various other reporting requirements 
in addition to ex ante  notifications and ex post  
reporting. One particular example is that, pur -
suant to Article 96 of the SSM Framework 
Regulation, the ECB is to be notified whenever 
an institution’s financial situation deteriorates 
rapidly and significantly.ECB needs infor-

Projects in the SSM
SREP for less significant 
 institutions
Background
The supervisory review process (second pillar of 
the Basel Framework) is designed to ensure a 
comprehensive analysis of an institution’s risks 
and the capital available to cover them, taking 
into account individual circumstances. The two 
components of the second pillar are the cre -
ation of an internal capital adequacy assess -
ment process (ICAAP) and the supervisory 
 review and evaluation process (SREP).
Under the SREP , supervisors review the arrange -
ments, strategies, processes and mechanisms 
implemented by an institution to comply with 
the prudential requirements. The risks faced by 
an institution, as well as its capital and liquidity 
adequacy, are also evaluated. The objective is 
to determine whether an institution has en -
sured adequate and effective risk management 
as well as sufficient risk coverage. The results of 
the SREP form the central basis for the annual 
institution- specific operational supervisory 
planning and for determining supervisory 
measures.At the European level, the SREP requirements 
are anchored in Article 97 of CRD IV,8 while 
their transposition into German law is set out in 
section 6b of the German Banking Act. BaFin 
and the Bundesbank are responsible for per -
forming the SREP for German LSIs.
Future design of the SREP
The European Banking Authority (EBA) pub -
lished guidelines on the SREP on 19 December 
2014.9 The guidelines are addressed to the 
competent authorities of the EU member 
states, who must apply them from 2016 on -
wards. They constitute a comprehensive overall 
framework for the structure of the SREP .
As part of its indirect supervision function, the 
ECB is currently developing a harmonised SREP 
methodology for LSIs in cooperation with 
BaFin, the Bundesbank and the other NCAs. 
The work looks likely to extend into 2017,

ise fully at a later date. The methodology is es -
sentially being developed in line with both the 
EBA’s SREP guidelines and the SSM’s SREP 
methodology for significant institutions, which 
has been in use since 2015. It will define min -
imum requirements on which NCAs will base 
SREP performance in future. Responsibility for 
the actual application of the SREP in Germany 
nonetheless remains with BaFin and the Bun -
desbank.
The basic structure of the SREP is shown in the 
chart on page 59. The SREP is built around four 
main elements:
– Business model analysis
– Assessment of governance and risk 
 management
– Assessment of capital risks and capital 
a dequacy
– Assessment of liquidity risks and liquidity 
adequacy
Common to all four elements is the fact that 
they are subject to an ongoing risk assessment 
in the form of a risk assessment system (RAS), 
similar to the previous supervisory risk profile. 
The development and implementation of the 
RAS is a current focus of SSM work.
Under the future RAS, the individual elements 
will be assigned rating scores on a scale of one 
to four – as has so far been the case – and a 
detailed verbal assessment will be made of 
each element. The evaluation is therefore 
based on both quantitative and qualitative cri -
teria. The quantitative risk evaluation is based 
on selected indicators taken from supervisory 
reporting and other data sources. With the ob -
jective of introducing a harmonised procedure 
throughout the SSM, the automatic ratings cre -
ated in the RAS will make this assessment pro -
cess more standardised. These ratings will serve 
as the starting point for more in- depth, 
institution- specific analysis, which in turn lies at 
the heart of the RAS. The provisional automatic 
ratings are comprehensively validated and sup -
plemented with additional information, before a final score is given for each specific area. 
 Finally, the scores are condensed to produce an 
overall score, which serves as a measure of an 
institution’s viability.
In addition to the RAS, NCAs performing the 
SREP have to make their own assessment of 
the adequacy of each institution’s capital and 
liquidity, and make a decision on capital and 
liquidity requirements. The formulation of the 
capital requirements should take into account 
the RAS results, the institution’s ICAAP , and 
supervisory and internal stress tests. Risk-  
reducing diversification effects between indi -
vidual risk types will not be taken into account, 
however. Discussions concerning the details of 
how to determine the capital and liquidity re -
quirements have not yet been finalised.
At the end of the SREP , quantitative and quali -
tative supervisory measures should be deter -
mined based on an overall assessment. This will 
normally also involve setting a capital add- on, 
which will be a component of the SREP deci -
sion and will generally have to be covered by 
capital recognised for supervisory purposes.
In addition to the in- depth assessment of the 
various SREP elements, selected financial and 
non- financial key risk indicators are monitored 
on a quarterly basis; these are derived from the 
regular supervisory reporting system for each 
institution. The objective is to identify any 
changes in the financial situation and risk pro -
file of the supervised institution at an early 
stage.
Implementation of the proportionality principle 
is closely bound up with the development of 
the SREP methodology for LSIs. German super -
visors are advocating the proportional design 
and application of the SREP , and hence risk-  
oriented supervision, in order to take due ac -
count of the heterogeneous banking landscape 
in Germany with its multitude of small and 
medium- sized institutions. In particular, the 
SREP approach must comply with the require -
ments outlined in the EBA’s SREP guidelines, as Calculation of

well as being consistent with the SSM’s SREP 
methodology for significant institutions. In 
keeping with this, the proportional design of 
the SREP is based on an institution’s priority, 
amongst other things. Additional criteria are 
also to be used in order to adequately take into 
account the specifics of the institution in ques -
tion. This is demonstrated by the following pro -
portionality dimensions: frequency, scope and 
intensity of supervisory engagement as well as 
supervisory requirements for the institution’s 
risk management, for instance.
Between continuity and change
Many of the future SREP requirements are 
 already incorporated into the current German 
SREP approach, which means that there will 
certainly be a degree of continuity, especially 
with respect to supervisory requirements. At 
the same time, at least some change will come, 
chiefly in terms of supervisory practice. This 
change will, however, also have an indirect im -
pact on the supervised institutions, particularly 
in the form of capital add- ons.
Business model analysis is a frequent topic of 
discussion in this connection. Thus far, the 
business model has been analysed and evalu -
ated at several different points in the supervis -
ory assessment process. In future, business model analysis will be more rigidly structured, 
and the relevant information will be compiled 
systematically. For example, future analyses will 
explicitly assess the viability of a business model 
over the next 12 months and its sustainability in 
the coming three years. The analysis will be 
based on both quantitative data, such as the 
cost/income ratio and the return on equity, and 
qualitative assessments. However, supervisors 
are expressly advised not to prescribe a specific 
business model, nor are business models to be 
harmonised. Instead, institutions will retain re -
sponsibility for their business models. Nonethe -
less, supervisors will, in the interests of forward-

Moreover, vulnerabilities that could lead to the

result in a capital add- on being set. The exact

ternal procedures and methods will be the ini -
tial starting points for calculating the capital 
and liquidity requirements in future. This ap -
proach ensures that institutions’ individual cir -
cumstances are adequately taken into account. 
Consequently, the ICAAP can remain the key 
instrument for internal governance alongside 
the provisions of section 25a (1) of the German 
Banking Act and the BaFin Circular on the Min -
imum Requirements for Risk Management. 
German supervisors are endeavouring to sup -
port the ongoing development and enhance -
ment of the ICAAP and keep supervisory inter -
vention in internal governance to a minimum.
At present, the vast majority of LSIs in Germany 
already have sound levels of capital and liquid -
ity. Capital add- ons are already an option in 
Germany, in order to account for risks or defi -
ciencies in proper business organisation that 
were not, or only insufficiently, covered, for ex -
ample. In this respect, the future supervisory 
calculation of capital and liquidity levels repre -
sents an evolution of the current approach.
The future supervisory approach, which will 
have a significantly more quantitative focus, 
allows better comparisons and more harmon -
ised assessments to be made concerning insti -
tutions in the SSM. This is contingent on the 
availability of a harmonised database. How -
ever, this must not result in a purely mechanis -
tic derivation of the SREP results. Instead, quali -
tative assessments by the competent authority 
will continue to form a key component of the 
SREP .
The ECB’s SREP methodology for LSIs and the 
underlying criteria and indicators are initially to 
be the subject of extensive field tests. As the 
collaborative work between the ECB and the 
NCAs is no longer expected to be finalised in 
2016, but the EBA’s SREP guidelines have to be 
applied from 2016, German supervisors are 
currently working intensively on a suitable in -
terim solution for 2016.Besides the risks already covered in Pillar 1, 
interest rate risk, in particular – as one of the 
most significant bank- specific risks – will have 
to be accounted for in the capital quantifica -
tion. If required, additional material risks are to 
be included in the calculation when analysing 
an individual institution. The main objective 
must be to develop a practicable and compar -
able approach for the institutions, for example 
by using standardised indicators such as the 
Basel interest rate shock as a measure of inter -
est rate risk in the banking book.
Supervisory priorities for 2016
Background
Each year, the ECB and the NCAs set supervis -
ory priorities that are derived from the aggre -
gate of the individual institutions’ assessments, 
but also from the macro perspective. These pri -
orities determine the supervisory activities for 
the following 12 to 18 months. They constitute 
a key component of annual supervisory plan -
ning and support the coordination of supervis -
ory activities across various institutions. They 
thus help to create a level playing field and en -
hance the effectiveness of supervisory actions.
The supervisory priorities build on an assess -
ment of the key risks banks are facing and take 
into account economic, regulatory and super -
visory frameworks and developments. The 
supervisory priorities, which apply to the entire 
SSM, are passed by the Supervisory Board. 
Based on these priorities, the NCAs set out pri -
orities with respect to their specific banking 
sectors.
Priorities at the SSM level
The ECB, in cooperation with the NCAs, identi -
fied the key risks to the SSM institutions in 
2016. Among the risks identified, those of 
greatest significance are business model and 
profitability risk, followed by further key risks Institutions in 
Germany already have sound capital base at present

with varying levels of importance depending 
on the specific SSM country.
Based on these key risks, the SSM has defined 
five supervisory priorities for 2016:10
– Business models and profitability drivers
– Credit risk
– Capital adequacy
– Risk governance and data quality
– Liquidity
Priorities at the national level
German supervisors previously adopted a 
supervisory strategy each year, defining the key 
risks in the banking sector and the instruments 
available to tackle them. The supervisory prior -
ities at the national level thus constitute a flesh -
ing out of or extract from the supervisory strat -
egy.
Against the backdrop of the persistent low-  
interest- rate environment, business model and 
profitability risk is a particular focus at the na -
tional level, too. Increasing competition and 
cost pressure as well as changing technical 
conditions, such as advancing digitalisation, are 
further intensifying the pressure on profitability. 
This assessment was also confirmed by the sur -
vey conducted by BaFin and the Bundesbank in 
summer 2015 on the profitability and resilience 
of German credit institutions in the low-  
interest- rate setting, which questioned around 
1,500 small and medium- sized German banks. 
The survey showed that the persistently low 
interest rates weighed significantly on German 
credit institutions in all survey scenarios over a 
five- year period. If the low- interest- rate envir -
onment continues, a clear decrease in earnings 
can be expected. Given the existing surplus 
capital and available hidden reserves, most in -
stitutions are still able to withstand the strains 
caused by the low- interest- rate setting.11 None -
theless, the viability and sustainability of busi -
ness models as well as the profitability drivers 
of the institutions will be supervisory priorities 
at the national level in 2016.The possible further consequences of a persist -
ent low- interest- rate setting are closely linked 
to this topic. German supervisors will keep a 
watchful eye on whether institutions loosen 
their lending standards or enter into a greater 
volume of speculative transactions. The impact 
of a sudden interest rate rise must also be ana -
lysed carefully.
This is not the only area where there is overlap 
between the supervisory priorities at the na -
tional and SSM levels. German supervisors, too, 
will focus on deficits in institutions’ risk man -
agement as well as the adequacy and security 
of their IT systems in 2016, for instance.
Conclusion and outlook
Responsibility for the direct supervision of LSIs 
remains with the NCAs, which in Germany 
means BaFin and the Bundesbank. Therefore, 
the direct effects on LSIs of the ECB’s indirect 
super vision are, in principle, limited. Further -
more, the ECB must take into account the pro -
portionality principle when exercising indirect 
supervision.
Nonetheless, various individual aspects are 
likely, over time, to result in indirect effects on 
the institutions, at the very least. This relates in 
particular to the joint supervisory standards 
currently being developed. Once they have 
been adopted, these will be applied by the 
NCAs, which will affect the way in which insti -
tutions are supervised.
Indirect effects also stem from the specification 
of supervisory priorities as an integral part of a 
supervisory strategy. The key priority for 2016 
at the SSM and national levels will be the viabil -
ity and sustainability of business models as well 
as the institutions’ profitability drivers.Supervisory

2016, ECB press release dated 6 January 2016.

The general finding is that the creation of the 
SSM has made the supervisory approach more 
quantitative; equally, more emphasis has been 
placed on peer comparisons between institu -
tions. This approach allows for better compar -
ability and harmonised assessment of institu -
tions across national borders, thus tackling the 
weak points revealed by the financial and eco -
nomic crisis.
Thanks to the close cooperation and intensive 
dialogue between the ECB and the NCAs at 
various levels, the experience thus far with SSM 
supervision of LSIs can be viewed as positive 
overall.Irrespective of this, some challenges remain. 
This year, a particular focus will be on further 
optimising the exchange of information and the 
coordination processes between the ECB and 
NCAs. It will also be important to pay sufficient 
attention to the proportionality principle and 
the clear division of responsibilities between the 
ECB and the NCAs when further harmonising 
supervisory processes and practices. BaFin and 
the Bundesbank will work together to ensure 
this. Under these conditions, the SSM is an op -
portunity to achieve better and more effective 
supervision throughout the European banking 
sector, making a key contribution to the stability 
of the financial system in the euro area.Deutsche Bundesbank
