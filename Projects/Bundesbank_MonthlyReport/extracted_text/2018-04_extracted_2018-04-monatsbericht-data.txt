Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The German economy continues to boom, 
even though the growth rate of gross domestic 
product (GDP) in the first quarter of 2018 might 
be distinctly lower than in the preceding quar -
ters. Contrary to previous expectations, the 
manufacturing sector is likely to have made, at 
best, only a marginal contribution to the ex -
pansion of economic activity. Industrial output 
fell sharply in February and data for January 
were also revised downwards. As regards the 
low output in February, strikes in the metal -
working and electrical engineering industries 
as  well as the unusually severe flu outbreak 
probably played a role. The latter is also likely 
to have dampened economic activity in other 
sectors. In line with the decline in manufactur -
ing output, German enterprises also suffered a 
sharp setback in their export business in Febru -
ary. The orders situation in industry is still very 
good, however, and there is no shortage of 
new orders in the construction sector either. 
The recent upward revision of the statistical 
data on construction output supports the pic -
ture of a sector near to full capacity.
Industry
German industrial output went down steeply in 
February 2018. The strikes in the metalworking 
and electrical engineering industries and the 
particularly severe flu outbreak this year prob -
ably contributed to the decline of a seasonally 
adjusted 2% on the month. The impact of 
these one- off effects was still moderate in 
January and on an average of January and Feb -
ruary the contraction in industrial output at 
¼% compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 
was significantly smaller. Broken down by sec -
tor, German manufacturers of machinery and 
equipment in particular had to cope with sharp production cutbacks. The production of com -
puter, electronic and optical products also fell 
substantially. In line with this, the output of 
capital goods as a whole experienced the 
strongest decline (-¾%). Manufacturers of 
intermediate goods were likewise unable to 
maintain the high level of production of the 
fourth quarter last year (-½%), while signifi -
cantly more consumer goods were produced 
(+1½%).
In February 2018, a slight month- on- month rise 
in industrial orders was recorded in seasonally 
adjusted terms (+¼%). On an average of Janu -
ary and February, however, the inflow of orders 
was significantly down on the quarter (-1½%). 
In regional terms, the decline in demand within 
Germany and from non- euro area countries 
had a particularly dampening effect. By con -
trast, impetus was provided by buoyant eco -
nomic developments in the euro area, which 
generated considerably more new orders. With 
regard to the individual sectors, mainly inter -
mediate goods manufacturers recorded fewer 
new orders (-2½%). In addition, producers of 
capital goods also faced muted demand 
(-1¼%). By contrast, the inflow of orders for 
consumer goods held steady at the high level 
of the last quarter of 2017. Overall, the recent 
slowdown in incoming orders in German indus -
try must be seen in the context of the excep -
tionally large volume of orders towards the end 
of 2017. For instance, the level of industrial 
orders in February was clearly higher than the 
figure for the fourth quarter of 2017. The orders 
situation can thus still be considered very posi -
tive.
Industrial sales followed industrial output in 
February 2108 and fell sharply on the month in 
seasonally adjusted terms (-2%). On an average 
of January and February, the decline, at ¼%, 
was significantly smaller compared with the 
final quarter of 2017. In regional terms, the 
moderate overall figure was mainly a result of a GDP growth rate 
expected to be 
lower in first 
quarter than 
in preceding 
quarters

strong decline in non- euro area countries. The 
decline in automotive sales, in particular, had a 
major impact here. Sales in Germany as well as 
in the euro area continued to rise markedly, 
however. With regard to the economic sectors, 
sales declined across the board, as sales of 
intermediate, capital and consumer goods con -
tracted at a similar rate. In line with this, nom -
inal exports posted a significant seasonally ad -
justed fall in February compared with the previ -
ous month (-3¼%) and on an average of Janu -
ary and February they were thus clearly down 
on the fourth quarter of 2017 (-¾%). In price- 
adjusted terms, the decline was even some -
what stronger at 1%. Compared with exports, 
nominal imports decreased considerably less in 
February on the month (-1¼%). On an average 
of January and February there was therefore 
still a slight increase (+¼%) compared with the 
previous quarter, but this was a result of higher 
prices alone.
Construction
Construction output in February 2018 showed 
a sharp decline on the month. The contraction 
of a seasonally adjusted 2¼% must be seen in 
the context of the colder than average weather 
conditions for this period and the preceding 
months’ figures being revised upwards signifi -
cantly, however. Taking an average of January 
and February, this resulted in a considerable in -
crease in construction activity compared with 
the final quarter of 2017 (+1¼%). Growth in 
activity in the finishing trades (+1¾%) was 
slightly stronger than in the main construction 
sector (+¾%). Other economic indicators also 
suggest that the construction boom in Ger -
many will continue. Orders received in the main 
construction sector declined significantly in 
January –  figures are available up to then  – 
compared with the average of the extremely 
strong final quarter of 2017. The volume of 
orders was clearly higher than the average of 
the third quarter of 2017, however. According 
to the construction price index of the Federal 
Statistical Office, the increase in prices for con -Construction

struction work continued to accelerate and in 
February reached 4.2% compared with the pre -
vious year.
Labour market
Employment rose sharply in February 2018, al -
though less so than in the previous three 
months. The total seasonally adjusted number 
of persons in work went up by 45,000 on the 
month. Over the last twelve months, the in -
crease amounted to 618,000 persons, or 1.4%. 
Growth in total employment continued to be 
sustained by the strong rise in jobs subject to 
social security contributions; in January 2018, 
these were up by as much as 762,000 on the 
year. By contrast, the number of self- employed 
persons and persons working exclusively in 
low- paid part- time jobs both contracted signifi -
cantly in a 12-month comparison, although in 
the latter the decline has slowed down for the 
time being. Leading indicators of the demand 
for labour such as the Federal Employment 
Agency’s BA-  X job index and the labour market 
barometer of the Institute for Employment 
Research  (IAB) are all holding steady at an ex -
tremely high level, but have not risen further 
overall. The Ifo employment barometer has 
even seen a distinct contraction.
After seasonal adjustment, unemployment in 
March 2018 showed a significant fall on the 
month. There were 2.37 million persons regis -
tered as unemployed with the Federal Employ -
ment Agency, 19,000 fewer than in February. 
The unemployment rate went down by 0.1 per -
centage point to 5.3%. This means that the 
registered unemployment figure was 204,000 
lower than in March 2017. Total underemploy -
ment even showed a slightly stronger decrease 
as the number of persons taking part in labour 
market policy measures gradually declined. The 
unemployment component of the IAB labour 
market barometer rose slightly in March and 
points to a further decrease in unemployment 
over the next three months.Prices
In March 2108, crude oil prices initially re -
mained at the low level quoted at the end of 
February. However, they went up distinctly at 
the middle of the month, mainly on the back of 
geopolitical uncertainties. On average, the fig -
ure was 1.6% up on the month. Prices con -
tinued to rebound significantly in the first half 
of April. As this report went to press, the price 
of a barrel of Brent crude oil stood at US$74. 
The discount on crude oil futures was US$2¾ 
for deliveries six months ahead and US$5¾ for 
deliveries 12 months ahead.
Import prices fell significantly in February 2018, 
mainly due to the energy component. How -
ever, even excluding energy, the earlier appreci -
ation of the euro continued to have a dampen -
ing impact on prices. By contrast, domestic 
sales prices, for which data up to March are 
already available, remained broadly stable in -
cluding and excluding energy. At the end of the 
period under review, the year- on- year figure for 
import prices turned negative (-0.6%) and held 
steady at +2.0% in the case of industrial produ -
cer prices.
After seasonal adjustment, there was no fur -
ther growth in consumer prices (HICP) in March 
2018. Somewhat stronger price increases for 
services and a moderate upward momentum 
for rents were offset by falling prices for energy 
and other industrial goods. Food prices re -
mained largely unchanged. The year- on- year 
growth rate rose from +1.2% to +1.5% (CPI 
+1.6% from +1.4%) due in part to the strong 
decline in food prices in March 2017. Excluding 
energy and food, annual inflation fell from 
+1.4% to +1.3%. A negative base effect in 
non- energy industrial goods and a drop in their 
prices in the current month overshadowed the 
price- enhancing effects of an early Easter on 
services.Further rise in

Public finances1
Local government finances
Following another highly positive final quarter, 
the local government core budgets and off-  
budget entities recorded a surplus of €10½ bil -
lion in 2017, which is double the already fa -
vourable surplus recorded one year previously. 
Again, total revenue rose considerably, by 4½% 
(€11½ billion). This was attributable, first and 
foremost, to additional tax receipts of €6 billion 
(+7%), which were primarily from the munici -
pal share of income tax. However, there was 
also a marked increase in local business tax 
receipts  and turnover tax revenue (resulting 
from the amount of €1 billion ceded by central 
government). Transfers from state government 
accounted for revenue growth of €2½ billion 
(+3%). On the one hand, the general grants 
afforded under the local government financial 
equalisation schemes and central government’s 
contribution to accommodation costs for re -
cipients of unemployment benefit II, which was 
increased in part for the purpose of offsetting 
refugee-  related expenditure, each went up by 
€1½ billion. On the other hand, however, there 
was a marked decline in refunds, in particular – 
likely not least in connection with the declining 
numbers of asylum seekers. Revenue from fees 
rose sharply once again (by 6%, or €1½ bil -
lion), not least due to an expansion of the 
reporting  group in North Rhine-  Westphalia 
continuing to make itself  felt in the first half of 
the year.2
On the expenditure side, growth remained 
much more subdued on the whole at 2½% (€6 
billion). Other operating expenditure grew at 
the same pace (by €1½ billion). By contrast, 
personnel expenditure increased by a fairly 
sharp 4½% (€3 billion), with only around half 
of this rise being arithmetically attributable to 
the second stage of the general increase in 
negotiated  pay rates from February 2017 on -
wards. Somewhat less was spent on social 
benefits, however. In view of the spike in the 
number of asylum seekers qualifying for refu -gee protection, there was a significant increase 
in accommodation costs for recipients of (cen -
tral government- financed) unemployment 
benefit II (+6%, or €½ billion). However, spend -
ing on benefits for asylum seekers who have 
not (yet) qualified for such protection fell far 
more sharply overall (-34%, or €2 billion). 
Spending on social assistance remained on its 
marked upward trajectory (+3%, or €1 billion), 
despite some relief being afforded by last year’s 
expansion of the benefits provided under the 
public long- term care insurance scheme.3 
Thanks to dynamic developments in the final 
quarter, the upturn in fixed asset formation 
stood at 3½% (€1 billion). Overall, growth in 
investment expenditure at each government 
level was driven primarily by the acquisition of 
immovable and movable assets. However, 
spending fell slightly in construction invest -
ment, the largest sub- sector, with develop -
ments varying greatly from federal state to fed -
eral state.
From this year onwards, a long- term central 
government package providing an additional 
€2½ billion will ease the strain on local govern -
ment coffers. In addition, further marked in -
creases in other receipts from taxes and trans -
fers from state government are expected. By 
comparison, burdens such as those arising 
from the negotiated wage agreement are likely 
to have a lesser impact on local government 
core budgets and off- budget entities. Overall, 
there ought to therefore also be funds available 
for the significant expansion of fixed asset for -
mation by local government without fully 
depleting  surpluses. In the medium term, meas -2017: further

1 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain a detailed description of 
public finance developments during the preceding quarter. 
For detailed data on budgetary developments and public 
debt, see the statistical section of this report.
2 In the third quarter of 2016, further off- budget entities 
were added to the reporting group for cash statistics. As a 
result, the growth rates for revenue and expenditure were 
still biased upwards in the first half of 2017.

ures such as phasing out special transfers to 
other government levels in the case of local 
business tax will also provide further relief. 
While the Federal Constitutional Court most 
recently  ruled that real estate tax is unconstitu -
tional in its current form, it has granted a long 
transitional period (compared with the periods 
granted in other rulings) for the continued ap -
plication of existing legislation.4 As a result, it 
should be possible to prevent the loss of this 
important source of revenue. Overall, the out -
look for local government finances is therefore 
favourable, and there should be fiscal space 
available in many municipalities.
As the municipalities used their surpluses in 
large part to boost their reserves, debt reduc -
tion lagged far behind their cash surplus. That 
said, local government debt had fallen mark -
edly by €6 billion to €142½ billion compared 
with the level observed at the end of 2016,5 
with regular loans and securities debt having 
contracted by €1½ billion to €98½ billion. The 
volume of cash advances fell more sharply, 
decreasing  by €4½ billion to €43½ billion. A 
high level of debt per capita  arising from such 
cash advances, which are actually only in -
tended to bridge short- term liquidity shortfalls, 
points to a strained financial situation. A state- 
by- state analysis reveals that the values for 
Saarland, Rhineland-  Palatinate, North Rhine-  
Westphalia and Hesse have significantly ex -
ceeded national figures for some years now. 
The fact that the local authorities in these four 
states accounted, in net terms, for almost the 
entire decline in cash advances suggests that 
considerable progress has now been made 
here, too, in the area of fiscal consolidation.
Securities markets
Bond market
At €99.4 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in February 2018 was slightly up 
on the January figure (€96.2 billion). After de -
ducting redemptions, which were lower than in the previous month, and taking account of 
changes in issuers’ holdings of their own debt 
securities, the outstanding volume of domestic 
bonds grew by €5.3 billion. Foreign debt secur -
ities worth €0.4 billion net were placed in the 
German market. On balance, therefore, the 
outstanding volume of debt securities in Ger -
many rose by €5.7 billion.
In the reporting month, credit institutions issued   
debt securities worth €12.7 billion net, com -
pared with €1.2 billion in the previous month. 
On balance, these were almost exclusively debt 
securities issued by specialised credit institu -
tions, the outstanding volume of which rose by Debt in 2017

€10.4 billion. Other bank debt securities, mort -
gage Pfandbriefe and public Pfandbriefe were 
also placed in the market, albeit with lesser vol -
umes of €1.7 billion, €0.5 billion and €0.1 bil -
lion net respectively.
Domestic enterprises increased their capital 
market debt by €2.1 billion net in February, 
compared with €0.5 billion in the previous 
month. Mainly instruments with a maturity of 
more than one year were issued (€1.1 billion).
By contrast, the public sector decreased its 
holdings of bond market liabilities by €9.5 bil -
lion net in the reporting month, compared with 
€4.0 billion in the previous month. On balance, 
this was primarily attributable to state and local 
governments, which redeemed securities in the 
amount of €8.0 billion net. The Federal govern -
ment redeemed predominantly five- year Fed -
eral notes worth €13.7 billion net. This con -
trasted with net issuance of two- year Federal 
Treasury notes (Schätze) in the amount of €5.9 billion, ten- year and thirty- year Federal bonds 
(Bunds) totalling €3.8 billion and €1.7 billion 
respectively  , and Federal Treasury discount 
paper (Bubills) worth €1.0 billion.
The Deutsche Bundesbank, in particular, 
bought debt securities in February, adding a 
net €5.7 billion worth of paper to its balance 
sheet, primarily under the Eurosystem’s asset 
purchase programmes. Non-  resident investors 
and domestic non- banks purchased bonds 
worth €3.8 billion and €1.1 billion net respect -
ively. By contrast, German credit institutions 
sold debt securities totalling €5.0 billion net.
Equity market
In the reporting month, new shares worth €1.1 
billion were issued in the German equity mar -
ket. Over the same period, the outstanding vol -
ume of foreign shares in Germany increased by 
€14.0 billion. Domestic non- banks dominated 
the buyers’ side of the market in February, 
acquiring  shares totalling €19.2 billion net. By 
contrast, domestic credit institutions and non-  
resident investors sold equities in the net 
amount of €3.7 billion and €0.3 billion respect -
ively.
Mutual funds
In February, the inflows recorded by domestic 
mutual funds were smaller than in the previous 
month (€8.6 billion compared with €15.0 bil -
lion). The fresh funds benefited mainly special -
ised funds reserved for institutional investors 
(€6.8 billion). Among the various asset classes, 
equity funds in particular recorded inflows 
(€2.3 billion), but funds of funds (€1.7 billion), 
mixed securities funds (€1.6 billion), open- end 
real estate funds (€1.3 billion) and bond funds 
(€1.0 billion) also saw fresh funds injected. By 
contrast, the volume of foreign mutual fund 
shares in the German market fell by €1.4 billion 
in February. Domestic non- banks were the sole 
buyers of mutual fund shares on balance (€7.3 Net issuance on

Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €20.7 billion in February 2018. The result 
was €0.4 billion up on the previous month be -
cause the increase in the goods account sur -
plus was slightly larger than the decline in the 
surplus from invisible current transactions, 
which comprise services as well as primary and 
secondary income.
The surplus in the goods account widened by 
€1.5 billion on the month to reach €19.8 billion 
in the month under review, with goods imports 
falling more sharply than goods exports.
The surplus generated by invisible current trans -
actions fell by €1.1 billion to €0.9 billion in Feb -
ruary, primarily because the deterioration in the 
primary income balance outweighed the im -
proved outturn in the services account. Net 
receipts  in the primary income account con -
tracted by €1.9 billion to €5.7 billion, largely on 
account of higher dividend payments on port -
folio investments by non- residents. In addition, 
the deficit in the secondary income account 
widened slightly, increasing by €0.3 billion to 
€5.4 billion. The services account, meanwhile, 
closed with a surplus of €0.7 billion in February, 
following a deficit of €0.5 billion one month 
earlier, because expenditure shrank more 
strongly than receipts. A closer look at this 
account   reveals a preponderance of smaller 
declines  in multiple items on both sides of the 
balance sheet, though receipts from IT services 
did pick up distinctly.
The international financial markets in February 
saw price corrections on the equity markets 
and rising yields on government bonds. This 
was the backdrop against which Germany’s

invest ors for international securities was muted 
at best, with purchases of foreign securities 
coming to €2.9 billion overall. Their acquisi -

Direct investment generated net capital exports 
of €4.5 billion in February, compared with €4.2 
billion one month earlier. Domestic enterprises 
supplied their affiliates abroad with a net €13.6

did this by stepping up their foreign affiliates’ 
equity capital (€16.4 billion), both by injecting 
equity capital in the narrower sense of the term 
and by reinvesting net earnings. Intra- group 
lending, on the other hand, was scaled back 
(€2.8 billion). Non- resident enterprises, mean -while, invested €9.1 billion in affiliated enter -

loans (€7.3 billion). On top of this, they in -

Wage growth in Germany: assessment and 
determinants of recent developments
The swift macroeconomic recovery in Germany following the recent recession was accompanied 
by strong growth in employment. Furthermore, last year saw unemployment hit its lowest level 
since German reunification. While the initial phase of the economic recovery brought with it 
catch- up effects in nominal rates of wage growth, the rise in hourly earnings since 2014 has failed 
to keep pace with the continuing high demand for labour. The finding of comparatively moderate 
wage growth over the past few years has also attracted attention internationally. Moreover, as 
wage growth is a key determinant of trend inflation, it is in the interests of monetary policymak -
ers to observe and analyse the wage formation process.
Comparisons with similar phases of the business cycle before the Great Recession and with wage 
growth in other euro area countries do not suggest a weakening of wage dynamics. The leeway 
for income distribution, which can be defined by labour productivity and prices, has also been 
utilised quite well over the past few years – in contrast to the preceding decade. Nevertheless, the 
finding of moderate wage growth emerges more clearly by placing it in the empirical context of 
the determinants used in the economic literature. Analyses using the Beveridge curve and the 
wage Phillips curve present a picture of perceptibly dampened wage dynamics.
The results also indicate that the high level of labour market- oriented net migration over the past 
few years, chiefly from other EU countries, has helped to satisfy the increasing demand for labour. 
This has tended to be accompanied by a wage dampening effect. All things considered, the data 
currently available suggest that this effect stems to a large extent from many immigrant workers 
taking up employment in comparatively low- paid areas of activity or sectors.
Over the past few years, relatively moderate productivity growth and subdued inflation itself have 
also played a part in wage growth. Their impact in this period does not appear to be larger than 
average, however. Furthermore, non- wage- related factors in the negotiated pay settlements, 
such as making working hours more flexible combined with possibilities of opting for a higher 
wage increase or more time off, were of major importance, although it is difficult to quantify their 
impact on wage dynamics.
Looking to the future, there is much to suggest that the dampening effects will have a decreasing 
impact. The tightening of the situation on the labour market, which can already be identified on 
the basis of several indicators, is therefore likely to play a greater role in shaping wage growth.Deutsche Bundesbank

Moderate wage growth with 
high increase in employment
The rapid macroeconomic recovery in Germany 
following the end of the recession in 2008-09 
was accompanied by strong growth in employ -
ment. Last year, unemployment, which has 
been declining since then, hit its lowest level 
since German reunification. Moreover, wage 
bargainers have once again been achieving pay 
settlements which are higher than those agreed 
during the period of marked wage moderation 
between 1997 and 2007. Added to this are in -
stances of higher profit- sharing granted to em -
ployees, including as compensation for wage 
concessions during the crisis and in view of ris -
ing corporate profits.1 In the following years, 
too, high bonus payments were made, espe -
cially in the large industrial corporates. Over 
the past few years, the upward trajectory of 
the dynamics of both negotiated pay rates and 
gross earnings has not continued at the same 
pace, however. Negotiated rates of pay on an hourly basis rose comparatively moderately by 
2.4% on an annual average during the period 
from 2014 to 2017.2 In the case of actual earn -
ings, the rates of growth during this period, at 
an annual average of 2.7%, may likewise be 
regarded  as rather moderate when measured 
by the ongoing positive development of the 
labour  market.3
The moderate nominal wage dynamics in Ger -
many over the past few years are, taken in isol -
ation, inconsistent with the extremely high de -
mand for labour. For some years now, various 
survey findings and indicators have been point -
ing to increasing tightness in the German 
labour  market. For example, the ifo Institute’s 
labour shortage indicator,4 the Federal Employ -
ment Agency’s BA-  X job vacancy index and the 
aggregate ratio of vacancies to unemployed 
persons have been reaching all- time highs since 
2015.
For monetary policy, the analysis of wage 
growth is of major importance with regard to 
potential instances of price pass- through which

1 In the metalworking and electrical engineering industries, 
for example, the IG Metall trade union entered pay negoti -
ations in the winter of 2010 without any specific wage de -
mands, and the ensuing negotiated pay settlement con -
tained an agreement that there would be no increase in 
scheduled rates of pay for 11 months. As compensation, 
employees received two one- off payments. The 2012 pay 
agreement then contained a permanent 4.3% increase in 
scheduled rates of pay from May 2012.

Consumer Prices.5 Nevertheless, wages are 
only one of several factors that determine 
prices. Moreover, they are not a politically man -
ageable macroeconomic variable but rather the 
outcome of a negotiation process, enshrined in 
the German constitution, between autono -
mous wage bargaining parties or individual 
employers and employees. From a monetary 
policy perspective, the analysis of wage devel -
opments is therefore based on a positive ap -
proach. The aim is not only to classify wage 
dynamics in terms of the real economic situ -
ation on the product and labour markets but 
also to set it in relation to current and expected 
macroeconomic price developments. This is be -
cause the latter are essentially what determines 
the monetary policy stance.
In order to assess recent wage dynamics in 
Germany, use is made, first, of comparisons 
with earlier boom periods in the German econ -
omy, with wage dynamics in other euro area 
countries, and with the nominal leeway for in -
come distribution resulting from productivity 
growth and inflation. Second, wage dynamics 
can be gauged on the basis of more econo -
metrically shaped model approaches. Two fre -
quently used concepts for analysing cyclical 
develop  ments in wages are the labour market 
search model, of which the Beveridge curve is 
one of the core components, and the (wage) 
Phillips curve.
Assessment of recent wage 
dynamics based on historical 
and regional comparisons
It is true that wage dynamics over the past few 
years have been weaker than they were in 
periods of economic prosperity in the former 
Federal Republic of Germany prior to reunifica -
tion. They were, however, noticeably stronger 
than in the two earlier expansionary periods for 
Germany as a whole: the economic upswing 
around the turn of the millennium as well as 
the boom immediately preceding the outbreak 
of the Great Recession of 2008-09. Actual hourly wages in Germany increased by 2.7% 
per year on an average of the period from 2014 
to 2017, while the increase in the two four- year 
periods from 1997 to 2000 and from 2004 to 
2007 amounted to no more than 2.0% and 
0.6% per year respectively.6 A similar picture 
can be seen in the case of negotiated rates of 
pay on an hourly basis, which, at 2.4% on aver -
age in the period from 2014 to 2017, likewise 
showed a higher rate of growth than in the 
two reference periods used for comparison, Various refer -

5 There is a two- way relationship between wages and 
prices; inflation may have feedback effects on wage forma -
tion. From a monetary policy angle, the focus is less on an 
analysis of real wages that is possibly of more immediate 
interest from the perspective of the social partners and 
with regard to issues to do with the real economy.
6 The introduction of the general statutory minimum wage 
at the beginning of 2015 and its latest increase in 2017 also 
play a certain part in this context. Roughly calculated, the 
introduction of the minimum wage contributed, as a one- 
off effect, around ½ percentage point to the rise in actual 
earnings in 2015. The introduction of the minimum wage 
had a minor effect on the increase in aggregate negotiated 
rates of pay, as the wage surge due to the minimum wage 
predominantly affected low- paid workers not covered by 
collective pay agreements. In addition, a series of generally 
binding sector- specific minimum wages were raised per -
ceptibly immediately prior to 2015, for example in the hair -
dressing trade. See Deutsche Bundesbank, Impact of the 
introduction of the minimum wage on consumer prices – 
initial findings, Monthly Report, May 2015, pp 64-66. To -
gether with the general statutory minimum wage, this also 
had an impact on higher pay grades. See Deutsche Bun -
desbank, Initial indications of how the minimum wage is 
affecting the increase in earnings, Monthly Report, August 
2015, pp 55-56. The upward wage impulses resulting from 
the latest increase in the minimum wage in 2017 remained 
manageable from a macroeconomic perspective.Deutsche Bundesbank

when the average annual increase was 1.9% 
and 1.0% respectively. This was also reflected 
in the recently positive wage drift – the differ -
ence between the rates of change in actual 
and negotiated rates of pay. The longer- term 
average of 2.1% per year since 1994 in the case 
of negotiated hourly rates of pay and of 2.2% 
per year in the case of actual hourly remuner -
ation was likewise exceeded on an average of 
the past four years.
Hourly wages have also increased relatively 
sharply in Germany recently when compared 
with other countries of the euro area. Since 
2014, which marked the beginning of the lat -
est economic upturn in the euro area, actual 
earnings in Germany – as mentioned above – 
have gone up by 2.7% per year on average, 
whereas the increase in other euro area coun -
tries has been only 1% during the same period.7 
Before the financial and economic crisis, how -
ever, the period from 2000 to 2007 saw a 
sharp rise in gross hourly earnings in the other euro area countries, at 3.5%, while the increase 
in Germany was considerably weaker at 1.4%. 
Overall, wage growth since the financial and 
economic crisis shows that the period of wage 
moderation in Germany has come to an end. 
Moreover, wage dynamics in Germany are serv -
ing as a positive stimulus for the aggregate rate 
of wage growth in the euro area.
Wage growth and the leeway 
for income distribution
One key benchmark for aggregate wage 
growth in the long term is provided by the lee -
way for income distribution. If real gross wages 
and salaries per hour grow on a long- term 
average at the same rate as hourly labour prod -
uctivity, the aggregate labour income share 
fluctuates around a constant average value 
that is consistent with a long- term growth 
equilibrium. Market- based wage growth in the 
long term is thus likely to be guided by both 
developments in labour productivity and the 
aggregate price level.8 Nevertheless, structural 
changes in an economy’s institutional frame -
work can lead to permanent changes in the 
level of the equilibrium labour income share. 
Additionally, the full effect of cyclical factors on 
the labour income share may unfold over a 
period of several years. As a result, aggregate 
wage growth may, on average, remain either 
above or below the leeway for income distribu -
tion for several years before the labour income 
share approaches the equilibrium level.

7 In many member states, key factors behind the wage 
increases following the financial and economic crisis, as 
well as the sovereign debt crisis, were the – sometimes 
marked – underutilisation in the labour market, country-  
specific adjustment processes as well as, in some cases, the 
labour market effects of major reforms. See Deutsche Bun -
desbank, Wage dynamics amid high euro area unemploy -
ment, Monthly Report, December 2016, pp 33-55.
8 From the employers’ perspective, the cost- related impact 
of wage increases relative to sales prices is likely to be of 
main interest, whereas for employees’ wage demands, a 
comparison with consumer prices in terms of the wage in -
creases’ purchasing power is of particular importance.Deutsche Bundesbank

From German reunification until about 2007, 
the price- adjusted rise in wages failed to keep 
pace with growth in labour productivity.9 Owing 
to this development, the aggregate labour in -
come share followed a downward trend in this 
period. The “wage moderation”, which per -
sisted roughly from 1997 until 2007, was pos -
sibly also a response to technological change, 
especially to the capital intensification of pro -
duction from the early 1990s to the outbreak 
of the financial and economic crisis in 2008. As 
a result, it was presumably possible to limit the 
employment losses caused by an increased 
substitution of capital for labour.10 The dimin -
ishing degree of collective bargaining coverage 
among employees – as documented by the IAB 
establishment panel – may have also have con -
tributed to the declining labour income share 
in this period. This effect is likely to be due – at 
least in some sectors – to the associated re -
duced bargaining power of trade unions in col -
lective wage bargaining.
In the period from 2011 to 2017, the pace of 
capital intensification slowed down, ie fewer 
workers were substituted by capital than be -
fore. More recently, the ratio of capital em -
ployed to total hours worked remained more 
or less unchanged. The wage- dampening ef -
fect of capital intensification has therefore 
been less pronounced over the past few years 
than on average since reunification, although 
the effect continues to exist. The decline in col -
lective bargaining coverage has also slowed 
down since the end of the financial and eco -
nomic crisis. In line with this, relatively small 
negative contributions to wage growth have 
been documented in empirical model analyses 
since then. Nevertheless, the precise timing of 
the effects of lower collective bargaining cover -
age and reduced trade union bargaining power 
on wage formation is subject to uncertainties. 
Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that this de -
velopment is affecting current wage dynamics 
more strongly than is suggested by the more or 
less unchanged degree of collective bargaining 
coverage in recent years.In the course of the recovery from the financial 
and economic crisis, labour productivity rapidly 
regained its previous level. Since then, how -
ever, labour productivity has grown at an an -
nual average of roughly 0.8%, which is consid -
erably below the pace in the years prior to the 
crisis.11 Its contribution to wage growth in re -
cent years was thus, if anything, below aver -
age. Moreover, the average inflation rate over

11 Possible factors in this context are also the productivity- 
dampening effects of the labour market integration of low- 
skilled persons in the wake of labour market reforms in the 
first half of the last decade as well as the high level of im -

shot its long- term average. According to Con -
sensus Economics data, the expected medium- 
term inflation rate relative to horizons of two 
to ten years fluctuated only a little around its 
long- term mean.12 Furthermore, owing to 
sharply falling energy prices, the inflation rate 
was extremely low in 2015 and 2016. If the 
period since 2011 is analysed to assess the ef -
fects of actual and expected inflation, wage-  
boosting impulses are likely to have been gen -
erated to a certain extent from 2011 to 2014 
compared with more wage- dampening ones in 
the years thereafter.13 In summary, wage 
growth over the past few years was higher 
than the contributions due to the increase in 
productivity and inflation.14 The trend of wage 
moderation has thus reversed. Nevertheless, at 
the end of the period under review, the aggre -
gate labour income share was still below its 
early-1990s level.15
Wage developments through 
the lens of the Beveridge 
and Phillips curves
The assessments of wage developments in 
recent  years made thus far, which have been 
based on simple comparisons with previous 
expan sionary periods, with other countries, 
and with the leeway for income distribution, do not support the notion of surprisingly weak 
wage growth in Germany. However, such com -
parisons largely neglect the respective eco -
nomic environment and the situation on the 
labour market itself. Approaches which are 
more deeply rooted in the empirical economic 
literature and which take these factors explicitly 
into account are available in the form of the 
Beveridge curve and the Phillips curve.
Wage growth in the recent past has exceeded 
the rates seen in previous economic upturns. 
However, in view of the currently very low level 
of underutilisation in the labour market, cur -
rent wage growth is only moderate by histor -
ical standards. For instance, the ratio of job 
vacancies  to unemployment has increased in 
recent years. This development is probably 
partly attributable to increased labour market 
efficiency. The rise in the ratio of job vacancies 
to unemployment appears to be more than just 
a short- term  cyclical phenomenon, as it also 
manifests itself in the longer- term trends of 
unemploy ment and vacancies. Placing the 
vacancy- unemployment ratio – which, accord -
ing to the Beveridge curve concept, is an indi -
cator of labour  market tightness – in relation to 
wage growth shows that wage developments 
have been in line with trend growth in the ratio

12 The expected inflation rate is cited in the press releases 
of some German trade unions as an important determining 
factor in wage negotiations. The estimation of expected 
inflation may be historical or forward- looking; see German 
Council of Economic Experts, Für eine zukunftsorientierte 
Wirtschaftspolitik, Jahresgutachten 2017/ 18, p 128.
13 According to a special survey by the Deutsche Bundes -
bank on the 2015-16 pay round, wage bargainers con -
sidered both the low actual rate of inflation and subdued 
inflation expectations to be of relevance at that time to the 
moderate outcome of wage negotiations.
14 This applies not only to the growth rate of negotiated 
wages but also, in particular, to that of gross wages and 
salaries. Over the past few years, the long- term determin -
ants were of greater importance for growth in negotiated 
wages than they were for growth in gross wages and sal -
aries, which reacted more strongly to changes in cyclical 
factors. In this regard, variable compensation components 
in the high income segment outside the collective wage 
scales possibly also played a part.
15 Data for the Federal Republic of Germany prior to reuni -
fication suggest that the aggregate labour income share 
had already been following a downward trend since the 
early 1980s, which was interrupted only for a short while 
in the early 1990s owing to high wage growth rates, espe -
cially in eastern Germany.Deutsche Bundesbank

of vacancies to structural unemployment. How -
ever, given the currently high degree of labour 
market tightness, it is not just trend factors but 
also cyclical factors that have played a role. 
With this in mind, estimation results show that 
wage growth in recent years was weaker than 
would have been expected on the basis of 
actual   labour market tightness alone (see the 
box on pages 20 and 21).16
The Phillips curve concept is probably the most 
prominent model- based tool for analysing cyc -
lical wage and price developments from a 
macroeconomic perspective.17 The wage Phil -
lips curve approach captures the relationship 
between the labour market in the real econ -
omy and nominal wage growth. When em -
ployed in macroeconomic models, the wage 
Phillips curve allows for the analysis of wage 
developments in relation to key macroeco -
nomic determinants. The core elements include 
a measure of labour market tightness and an 
assumption of how inflation expectations are 
shaped in the context of wage negotiations. 
Additional factors include labour productivity 
growth as well as, in some cases, institutional 
path dependencies in the wage- setting pro -
cess. Furthermore, the effects of exceptional 
historical factors, such as German reunification 
or the currently observed labour market-  
oriented immigration flow from other EU mem -
ber states, could also play a role. Using econo -
metric techniques, it is possible to quantify the 
assumed  relationships (see the box on pages 23 
to 25).
Following the wage Phillips curve concept, 
there is a positive relationship between wage 
growth and the contemporaneous degree of 
labour market tightness. One explanation for 
this is that, in times of high levels of employ -
ment, the search for a suitable job is consider -
ably easier than in times of high underemploy -
ment. Employers may therefore increase their 
wage offers in order to recruit new staff or re -
tain existing employees. Also, in collective 
wage negotiations, high labour demand is 
likely to strengthen the bargaining power of employees over employers. Currently, a large 
number of indicators suggest that labour mar -
ket demand is exceptionally high. For example, 
the number of registered unemployed is at its 
lowest level since German reunification. In add -
ition, the ratio of vacancies to the number of 
registered unemployed in Germany reached a 
record high in 2017. The vacancy rate has also 
increased more or less continuously since 2013, 
when the latest upturn in employment began. 
Furthermore, survey- based indicators, such as 
the ifo Employment Barometer or the IAB 
labour  market barometer, do indeed suggest 
very high labour demand in Germany. Esti -
mates of the unemployment gap, which is the 
difference between the unemployment rate 
and the structural rate of unemployment, are 
consistent with this finding. Given the current 
results of the available indicators, it is likely that 
the excellent situation on the German labour 
market in recent years has, all else being equal, 
exerted upward pressure on wage dynamics.Analysis in

Wages and labour market tightness from the perspective 
of the Beveridge curve
In addition to purely statistical benchmarks, 
current wage developments in Germany 
can be assessed using the wage dynamics 
that would be suggested by model- based 
analytical concepts. This can be done in a 
two- stage procedure. In a fi  rst step, the 
traditional search and matching model of 
the labour market – where unemployment 
may also arise in equilibrium – serves as a 
conceptual framework within which a trend 
measure for labour market tightness can be 
derived.1 Equilibrium labour market tight-
ness – ie the aggregate ratio of vacancies to 
unemployed – is the product of the inter-
play between wage- setting and the jobs on 
offer. It is assumed in this context that the 
larger the ratio of vacancies to unemployed, 
the higher the wages employees tend to be 
able to bargain. By contrast, the number of 
jobs offered by enterprises is likely to rise 
with lower wages, all else being equal. In 
the steady state, the vacancy to unemploy-
ment ratio is therefore associated with 
an  equilibrium wage. From an empirical 
perspective, the trend components of the 
labour  market variables are approximately 
in line with the steady state. In a second 
step, the rate of wage growth associated with the development of trend labour mar-
ket tightness according to the estimates de-
rived from a standard vector- autoregressive 
model is determined as a reference meas-
ure.2
The starting point for calculating trend labour  
market tightness is the Beveridge curve, 
which represents the combinations of vacan-
cies and unemployment. Its downward slope 
results from the fact that economic upturns  
typically go hand in hand with a decline  in 
unemployment and an increase in the num-
ber of vacancies. Using Federal Employ ment 
Agency unemployment fi  gures, the number 
of reported vacancies as well as labour mar-
ket fl  ows, it is possible to determine this 
macroeconomic relationship for Germany.3 
Following Germany’s far- reaching reforms in 
the fi  rst half of the 2000s, the underlying 
labour  market conditions have, in some re-
spects, changed substantially. This presents 
another diffi   culty when implementing such 
an approach empirically. The estimations indi-
cate that the Beveridge Curve has changed 
signifi  cantly in the wake of the labour market

through the lens of the Beveridge curve, Applied Eco-
nomics Letters 25 (7), pp 487-492.
3 In the model- based approach, the Beveridge curve 
depicts combinations of vacancies and unemployed 
where the associated unemployment rate remains 
constant over time, all else being equal. This means 
that the percentage change in the size of the labour 
force corresponds to the percentage change of those 
in work. This is composed of the share of unemployed 
persons and inactive persons entering employment 
plus the share of workers becoming unemployed or 
inactive. See M Daly, B Hobjin, A Sahin und R Valletta

reforms .4 In line with the transmission mech-
anisms based on the model approach, this is 
likely to refl  ect mainly the improved employ-
ment opportunities for the unemployed since 
then. This is due to a number of factors, in-
cluding more intensive job placement and 
greater efforts  in job seeking.5
On the basis of the derived Beveridge curve 
relationship, it is possible to use data on the 
time- varying structural unemployment rate 
to calculate the trend component of the 
number of vacancies.6 The results indicate 
that the trend vacancy to unemployment 
ratio – the degree of structural tightness in 
the labour market – has risen markedly in 
the period since the labour market reforms 
were introduced. Moreover it has increased 
somewhat further of late. Comparing this 
trend variable as a structural benchmark 
with the actual relationship of the vacancy 
to unemployment ratio, actual labour mar-
ket tightness has signifi  cantly exceeded its 
trend component over the past few years.
The trend labour market tightness derived 
from the Beveridge curve is then built into an 
econometric model as an explanatory vari-
able for wage growth. Further explanatory 
variables are labour productivity and price 
dynamics .7 The benchmark for wage in-
creases is the wage growth that was to be 
expected over the past years according to the 
model estimates and with regard to structural 
labour market tightness. The results indicate 
that actual wage dynamics in recent years 
were broadly consistent with the accelerating 
trend component of labour market tight-
ness.8 With regard to the cyclical component 
of labour market tightness, larger wage in-
creases were to be expected, all else being 
equal. If the simulation calculations are based 
on the actual tightness ratio, the wage in-
creases in the period since about 2015 would, 
in fact, have to be rated as rather low in com-
parison with the model- based dynamics. This 
suggests that, in the past few years, add-
itional dampening factors have been infl  uen-
cing the cyclical component of wages.4 In line with existing academic studies, dummy vari-
ables are used in our calculations to take account of 
possible structural breaks resulting from the labour mar-
ket reforms. See R Fahr and U Sunde (2009), Did the 
Hartz reforms speed up the matching process? A macro- 
evaluation using empirical matching functions, German 
Economic Review 10 (3), pp  284-316; S  Klinger and 
T Rothe (2012), The impact of labour market reforms 
and economic performance on the matching of the 
short- term and the long- term unemployed, Scottish 
Journal of Political Economy 59 (1), pp 90-114.
5 This is supported by the fact that there has been a 
persistent increase in transition rates of unemployed 
into employment since roughly 2007. See Deutsche 
Bundesbank, The macroeconomic impact of labour 
market reforms in Germany, Monthly Report, January 
2014, pp 34-36.
6 The non- accelerating infl  ation rate of unemployment 
(NAIRU), calculated within a Phillips curve- based frame-
work, serves as a measure of the structural unemploy-
ment rate. See F  Kajuth (2016), NAIRU estimates for 
Germany: new evidence on the infl  ation- unemployment 
trade- off, German Economic Review 17 (1), pp 104-125. 
As with the other data on labour market fl  ows used in 
the calculations, it is based on data on the unemploy-
ment rate according to the concept of the Federal Em-
ployment Agency. Using the trend unemployment rate 
based on the Hodrick- Prescott fi  lter produces more or 
less identical results.
7 Wage dynamics data are based on negotiated rates of 
pay on an hourly basis. Labour productivity growth is 
expressed as real gross value added per hour worked. 
The percentage change of the private consumption de-
fl  ator serves as the measure of infl  ation. The assessment 
period from 2013 onwards was not included in the esti-
mation sample.
8 The relatively strong increase in negotiated rates of 
pay in 2014 is also, in part, attributable to back- 
payments relating to retail sector salary increases agreed 
the previous year. See Deutsche Bundesbank, Economic 
conditions in Germany, Monthly Report, February 2014, 
p  61. Overall, the dynamics of actual earnings show 
slight fl  uctuation around the reference value in the re-
view period. Looking at actual earnings per hour, the 
interpretation of the wage dynamics barely changes.Labour market tightness in Germany

In addition to the concept of registered un -
employment, there are other approaches to 
measuring the underutilisation of labour based 
on a broader definition of underemployment. 
For example, the underemployment concept 
developed by the Federal Employment Agency 
also includes persons participating in active 
labour  market policies or those not working 
due to temporary incapacity.18 As participants 
in active labour market policies are not counted 
as officially unemployed , but would often be 
unemployed if they were not on these schemes, 
it seems that the Federal Employment Agency’s 
definition of underemployment more ad -
equately captures the measure of labour mar -
ket slack relevant for wage dynamics.19 The 
Federal Employ  ment Agency’s data on under -
employment corroborate the results based on 
the narrower indicators, showing that the la -
bour market is tight at present. Further, alterna -
tive measures of unemployment – for example, 
the internationally standardised unemployment 
rate (ILO definition) or the broad measure of 
underemployment based on Eurostat indica -
tors – follow a broadly similar path to that of 
registered unemployment or that of under -
employment as defined by the Federal Employ -
ment Agency, and therefore provide no notable 
additional explanatory power as far as wage 
growth is concerned.20
Given the high rates of immigration since 
around 2011, especially from central and east -
ern European countries that have joined the EU 
since 2004 and from southern European coun -
tries, it is possible that conventional measures 
of labour  market tightness, such as the rate of 
job vacancies relative to underemployment in 
Germany, reflect actual labour market tightness 
only inadequately.21 The introduction of full 
freedom of movement for workers in the EU 
since 2011 is one of the factors that have 
caused potential labour supply in Germany to 
increase considerably.22 By mid-2017 (up to 
which point relevant data are available), a net 
total of around 1.8 million persons had immi -
grated to Germany from other EU member 
states.Immigration can affect wage dynamics in 
Germany  via various channels. One important 
issue that needs to be determined is whether 
the skills profile of immigrants is relatively simi -
lar to that of domestic workers, or whether it 
tends to complement the latter.23 If the skills 
profiles are similar, immigrants compete with 
domestic workers in the German labour mar -
ket. The expansion of the relevant labour sup -
ply is thus likely to dampen wage growth – 
both in macroeconomic terms and for domes -
tic workers. By contrast, if the skills profiles are 
complementary, the resident population’s 
wages tend to rise as their skills profile be -
comes relatively scarcer as a result of immigra -
tion. Nevertheless, even in the latter case, there 
may be subdued wage growth at the macro -
economic level if the immigrants themselves 
are employed mainly in relatively low- paid jobs 
and if this effect prevails at the macroeconomic 
level.
In recent years, immigrants have largely taken 
up employment in sectors and low- complexity 
jobs with below- average wages, which has 
also been facilitated by the previous liberalisa -Broader

19 The added information value stems, in particular, from 
the fact that participation rates in active labour market pol -
icies are often the result of administrative factors – such as 
the testing of new programmes or the discontinuation of 
poorly evaluated ones  – and therefore follow different 
trends than registered unemployment.
20 The broad measure of underemployment based on 
Euro stat indicators comprises standardised unemployment 
(ILO definition) and additionally takes account of persons 
who work part- time but would like to work full- time, per -
sons who are looking for employment but are not currently 
available to work, or those who are available to work but 
are not currently looking for a job. This measure is similar 
to the U-6 rate of unemployment used by the US Bureau of 
Labor Statistics.
21 Job vacancies in Germany are, in principle, available to 
all job- seekers in Germany and other EU countries, whereas 
underemployment is a purely domestic concept.

Wage dynamics in Germany through the lens of 
a generalised  wage Phillips curve
The Phillips curve is a widely used empirical 
tool for analysing aggregate wage dynam-
ics. In the following, an example based on 
the wage equation of the Bundesbank’s 
macroeconometric model is presented. This 
wage equation combines the most com-
mon explanatory approaches for wage dy-
namics in both the long and the short 
term.1 Based on the concept of long- term 
labour market equilibrium, it is assumed 
that wage growth is related to develop-
ments in the aggregate price level and la-
bour productivity. In addition, cyclical fac-
tors such as fl  uctuations in the utilisation of 
labour may also play a role in the short to 
medium term:

The specifi  cation of the estimation equation 
relates the growth rate of gross wages and 
salaries, wt, to their deviation from the level 
implied by their long- term relationship with 
labour productivity, at, and the aggregate 
price level (measured here by the national 
consumer price index excluding food and 
energy), pt, (each in logarithmic form).2 This 
equation assumes that, in the long term, 
wage growth will align with the leeway for 
income distribution, which results from de-
velopments in labour productivity and the 
aggregate price level. This concept is based 
on the assumption that the labour income 
share fl  uctuates around a constant average 
value in the long term.3
Additional cyclical factors include the de-
gree of labour market tightness, /theta.stst, and labour  productivity growth. Furthermore, 
both the actual infl  ation rate, /pi.stt, and 
survey- based infl  ation expectations, /pi.ste
t, 
feed into the estimation equation, thus tak-
ing into account the forward- looking be-
haviour of employers and employees.4 The 
expected future infl  ation rate helps them to 
assess anticipated developments in real pur-
chasing power and real labour costs.5 
Moreover, net immigration from other EU 
member states to Germany relative to the 
domestic working age population (15 to 65 
years), EUIt, also plays an important role.6 
This fi  gure refl  ects the expansion of the 
labour  force due to the arrival of labour 
market- oriented immigrants from other EU 
member states over the past few years, and 
thus supplements the traditional measure 
of labour market tightness.
1 See O Blanchard and L Katz (1999), Wage dynamics: 
reconciling theory and evidence, American Economic 
Review 89(2), pp 69-74.
2 All wage and productivity data used here are hourly 
fi  gures.
3 This assumption is supported by the fact that the 
labour income share based on gross wages and salar-
ies in Germany displayed a declining trend in the fi  rst 
half of the sample period, particularly up to around 
2007. Yet an upward trend has been observed since 
2007, meaning that at present, the labour income 
share is once again around the same level as in the 
mid-1990s.
4 The number of vacancies relative to the Federal Em-
ployment Agency’s defi  nition of underemployment 
serves as a measure of labour market tightness, par-
tially constructed on the basis of data from the Ger-
man Council of Economic Experts. The survey- based 
infl  ation expectations supplied by Consensus Econom-
ics are based on a fi  ve- year horizon.
5 Further one- off effects, Tt, which infl  uence the 
growth rate of gross wages and salaries per hour, are 
due to unsystematic fl  uctuations in the total number 
of hours worked. This fi  gure is affected, inter alia, by 
rates of absence due to illness and weather conditions 
(particularly in the construction sector).
6 Immigration from other EU member states is typically 
labour market- oriented, as indicated by, among other 
things, the high employment rates among nationals of 
these countries in Germany.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

According to the estimation results, all coef-
fi  cients display plausible signs and are stat-
istically signifi  cant in most cases.7 The re-
sults also show that growth in gross wages 
and salaries in the short to medium term is 
positively correlated with growth in labour 
productivity, in the degree of labour market 
tightness and in actual as well as expected 
infl  ation rates. On the other hand, net im-
migration from other EU member states has 
exerted a dampening effect on wage 
growth in recent years. In addition, the re-
sults indicate that, in the sample period, the 
greater the deviation of gross wages and 
salaries from the level expected on the basis 
of labour productivity and the national con-
sumer price index, the higher the growth 
rate of gross wages and salaries in the fol-
lowing years.
Based on the estimation results, the contri-
butions of the various factors to past wage growth can be decomposed. In the long 
term, both consumer prices and labour 
productivity were important factors in wage 
growth. Among the cyclical factors, labour 
market tightness has delivered increasingly 
positive contributions to wage growth over 
the past few years. This also refl  ects the ex-
cellent situation on the German labour mar-
ket against the background of an intact 
wage Phillips curve.8 Whilst underemploy-
ment has been declining in the past few 
years, fi  rms may have tended to increase 
their wage offers in order to recruit new 
staff or retain existing employees. The con-
tribution of the expected infl  ation rate to 
wage growth was above average in the 
period from around 2012 to 2014, and has 
been more or less neutral since.
Strong labour market- oriented immigration 
from other EU member states has had a 
dampening effect on wage growth in the 
past few years. However, according to the 
estimations, wage pressures resulting from 
the domestic demand for labour have con-
siderably exceeded the wage- dampening 
impact of immigration at the same time. 
Furthermore, the results suggest that the 
wage effect of immigration kicks in with a 
time lag of up to three years. This lag, 
which appears relatively long at fi  rst glance, 
is consistent with fi  ndings of other studies 
on the duration of immigrants’ integration 
into the German labour market. For ex-
ample, according to evidence from the 
migra tion sample of the Institute for Employ-
ment Research (IAB) and the German Socio- 
Economic Panel (SOEP), the employment

tions of institutional conditions in the German 
labour market.24 By contrast, in the 1990s, dur -
ing the previous phase of strong net immigra -
tion to Germany, the capacity to absorb such 
forms of employment, which often serve as a 
stepping stone into the labour market, was 
more limited. Hence, the sectoral shifts to -
wards low- paid jobs were much smaller at that 
time.25
Overall, based on the data currently available, 
the dampening effect of labour market-  
oriented immigration on wage growth seems 
to be largely attributable to the relatively low 
wages immigrants earn themselves, rather than 
being due to immigration pushing down the 
wages of domestic workers.26 In addition, a 
comparison with previous groups of immi -
grants indicates that their relatively low aver -
age wage level thus far should increase consid -
erably as they become continuously better inte -
grated into the German labour market. Wage- 
augmenting effects resulting from this develop -ment are therefore expected in the coming 
years.
Institutional factors
As far as negotiated pay rates are concerned, 
estimates using the wage Phillips curve show 
that the growth rates of negotiated rates of 
pay in previous periods also play a role in the 
current wage growth developments. One rea -
son for this backward- looking component is 
likely to be the now rather common two- step 
structure of collective agreements concluded 
for a longer duration. Where collective agree -
ments are concluded for a period of two years, 
an initial increase generally occurs at the begin -
ning of the period, followed by a further in -
crease after the end of the first year. The 
second increase is often slightly lower, but the 
amount is still in keeping with the first in -
crease.27
In addition to the model- based results, there 
have also been other determinants of wage 
growth in recent years, with non- wage com -

24 In 2017, immigrants from these countries were, to a 
large extent, employed as unskilled or skilled workers in 
sectors of the economy with a rather low average wage 
level (agriculture, temporary agency employment, hospital -
ity, other business-  related services excluding temporary 
agency employment, construction and logistics).

period of immigration in Germany in the 1990s, see

many in the 1990s, European Economic Review 54,

within the EU in the 2000s. See B Galgoczi, J Leschke and

27 For example, the rather modest growth in negotiated 
rates of pay in 2017 is due in part to phased increases 
agreed more than one year previously in the context of 
very low inflation rates. A number of major economic sec -
tors, such as the metal- working and electrical engineering 
industries, negotiated as planned in 2018 after the previous 
round in 2016.Deutsche Bundesbank

text of collective agreements.28 For example, 
questions relating to the sustainability of occu -
pational pension schemes played a role in the 
pay round of central and local government in 
2016, while the flexibility of individuals’ work -
ing hours along with more options and per -
sonal freedom to take time off for family, to 
care for relatives, and for recuperation in the 
case of shift workers played a prominent role in 
the most recent pay round in the metal- working 
and electrical engineering industries.29 The ef -
fects of such components on the agreed in -
creases in negotiated pay rates are difficult to 
quantify. Under certain circumstances, they 
could lead, either directly or indirectly, to 
greater costs for employers – for example, if 
the increased complexity of human resources 
management raises the administrative burden. 
Moreover, agreed supplementary pension 
benefits increase employees’ compensation. It 
can generally be assumed that the negotiated 
wage resulting from a collective agreement is 
not independent of side agreements on other 
components not directly related to wages. As 
the interests of workers have often been satis -
fied in this regard in recent years, it is likely that 
this has somewhat dampened the collectively 
agreed wage increase.30
Conclusion and outlook
Comparisons with previous expansionary 
periods, developments in other countries and 
the leeway for income distribution provide no 
indication that nominal wage growth in Ger -
many has been unusually weak in Germany in 
recent years. Given the very high level of em -
ployment and the increasing shortage of skilled 
workers, substantially higher wage growth 
would have been expected in the last few 
years, based purely on historical regularities. 
However, a number of factors counteracted 
this trend. For example, the increased supply of 
available workers from the EU dampened ag -
gregate wage increases. One contributing fac -
tor was that the expansion of the labour supply 
due to immigration was often focused on sec -tors and low- complexity jobs with below-  
average wage levels. Moreover, the low infla -
tion rates in 2015 and 2016 and the relatively 
low productivity growth in recent years led to 
wage- dampening effects. Moreover, the im -
portance of qualitative non- wage related com -
ponents of wage agreements increased, but 
the direct and indirect wage effects of these 
are difficult to quantify. The fact that the col -
lective bargaining coverage of employees has 
fallen significantly over much of the past 20 
years has also played a role. While this decline 
has slowed in the past few years, it is likely that 
its effects were still unfolding.
From today’s perspective, in view of the under -
lying economic conditions, it is likely that nego -
tiated rates of pay will be higher in future than 
they have been in recent years. The dampening 
effect of labour market- oriented net migration 
on average earnings, which, according to esti -
mation results, is subject to a time lag, may yet 
be felt for some time. However, the gradual 
rise in inflation is, when viewed in isolation, 
likely to support wage growth in the near 
future , the available indicators suggest that the 
already pronounced labour shortages will prob -
ably continue to grow, and the economic out -
look remains favourable. In this respect, it is 
reasonable to assume that, in the coming 
years, labour market tightness will be reflected 
to a greater extent in actual wage develop -
ments.31Upward pres -

Report, August 2017, p 55.
29 The latest wage agreements for Deutsche Bahn, Volks-
wagen and Deutsche Post likewise give salaried employees 
the option of choosing between either the agreed wage 
increase or more leisure time.
30 This effect is not directly captured in the empirical tests 
presented here using the Beveridge curve and the wage 
Phillips curve. Instead, it is reflected in the residuals of the 
respective estimation equations, or it is implicitly taken into 
account via other determinants that show a statistical cor -
relation with this effect.

Germany’s external position:  
new statistical approaches and results 
since the financial crisis
Germany’s international investment position (IIP) shows its residents’ financial assets and liabilities 
vis- à- vis non- residents, valued at market prices. It documents and illustrates Germany’s external 
position vis- à- vis the rest of the world. Its importance as a macroeconomic account system has 
grown since the financial crisis because it highlights external interconnectedness and therefore 
potential channels of contagion. For this reason, the IIP is also part of the G20 initiative to identify 
and close data gaps. Germany’s net external assets, ie residents’ assets minus liabilities vis- à- vis 
non- residents, in relation to the nominal gross domestic product (GDP), grew from just under 
20% at the start of 2007 to around 60% by the end of 2017, with external assets standing at 
€8,346 billion against liabilities of €6,417 billion. The net external asset position in relation to GDP 
is an indicator in the European Union (EU) procedure for the prevention and correction of macro -
economic imbalances.
This article presents a three- dimensional account system that examines the changes in Germany’s 
net external assets in an income, instrument and sector account, each capturing specific aspects. 
The income account reveals Germany’s current account surpluses to be the driving force for 
generating  net external wealth, though this was partly offset by negative valuation effects and 
statistical adjustments. This is why growth in Germany’s net external assets failed to keep up with 
developments in the cumulative current account surpluses from 2007 to 2017; nonetheless, 
growth was still substantial with an increase of €1,457 billion or around 40 percentage points in 
relation to GDP.
The instrument account considers the IIP´s functional categories of financial assets. It demon -
strates the significance of portfolio investment in Germany’s IIP. For the first time in over 30 years, 
residents’ holdings of foreign securities are larger than non- residents’ holdings of securities issued 
in Germany. On the one hand, German enterprises and households have strongly invested in this 
asset class. On the other hand, non- residents have been net sellers of German government bonds 
since 2015, meaning that the stock of German government bonds within foreign portfolios has 
fallen by just over a quarter. The launch of the asset purchase programme (APP) in particular is 
likely to have contributed to this turnaround. In the sector account, enterprises and households 
recorded the highest increase in assets, thereby remaining the most important net creditor vis- à- 
vis non- residents. This is followed by the Bundesbank, which has now become the second- largest 
net creditor sector due to increasing TARGET2 claims. The net external position of monetary finan -
cial institutions declined by comparison, and government remained the only net debtor.
Finally, the article presents another newly developed approach that links the IIP database with 
exchange rate information in order to better explain and model the impact of exchange rate 
effects, namely the indices for exchange rate effects in the international investment position.Deutsche Bundesbank

The IIP as an external 
account  system in the 
European  and international 
context
The IIP shows all financial assets and liabilities 
between residents and non- residents, valued 
using market prices and exchange rates on the 
relevant reporting date. This means the IIP is a 
stock account for which the financial account, 
as a sub- account of the balance of payments, 
records the corresponding financial flows.1 
Changes in the IIP are the result of financial 
transactions with non- residents, which are 
shown in the financial account of the balance 
of payments, and valuation effects whenever 
market prices or exchange rates move.2 Cross- 
border holdings of financial assets have risen 
sharply in recent decades, with claims vis- à- vis  
non- residents significantly outpacing liabilities; 
on balance, Germany’s net external assets rose 
from just under 20% to around 60% of GDP 
from the start of 2007 to the end of 2017. 
When the European monetary union was 
launched at the start of 1999, Germany had a 
net foreign liability position.3
In absolute terms, Germany’s net external 
assets stand at €1,929 billion at the end of 
2017. A glance at the gross figures indicates 
that German creditors hold €8,346 billion worth of foreign assets, while Germany’s liabil -
ities stand at €6,417 billion. As a result, Ger -
many’s external assets and liabilities currently 
add up to four- and- a- half times its GDP . This 
ratio, which is also used to describe an econo -
my’s financial openness, grew fairly steadily 
until 2012 and has since remained at a high 
level.
The high level of financial openness also re -
flects stakeholders’ desire for internationally di -
versified investment. Investors believe that 
higher external assets reduce a portfolio’s vul -
nerability to national shocks and thereby stabil -
ise earnings prospects. If an ever larger share of 
German investors’ portfolios is made up of for -
eign investments or denominated in foreign 
currencies, “home bias” – signifying that the 
secur ities portfolios of individual countries 
usually  exhibit a clear preference for instru -
ments of that country4  – in portfolio invest -
ment declines.
At the same time, however, capital market 
develop ments in other countries or exchange 
rate movements are also having a greater im -
pact on the national economy: cyclical stimuli 
are increasingly being passed on not only via The German 
economy’s net

2 Finally, “other adjustments” also cause changes in the IIP . 
These mainly comprise conceptual and methodological 
deviations  from the balance of payments and may be of a 
considerable magnitude. Shifts that occur on account of 
the reallocation of an investment to another functional cat -
egory or of an enterprise to another sector, for example, 
are also documented here.

conventional channels, such as international 
trade links, but also through income and wealth 
effects, which are determined by level and 
structural shifts in external assets.5 This was ob -
served during the international financial and 
sovereign debt crisis.6 Since the IIP shows not 
only aggregates and net figures but also the 
structure of the asset and liability sides, risk and 
sensitivity analyses can be carried out for the 
various sectors, for instance by drawing on 
their capital structure, maturity profile and cur -
rency breakdown.7 This may provide initial indi -
cations of a potential change in the value of 
assets as a result of market price or exchange 
rate movements.8
The resolutions by the finance ministers and 
central bank governors of G20 countries in 
2009 and 2015 on the Data Gaps Initiative also 
take account of the greater importance of the 
IIP as a macroeconomic account system.9 The 
aim of this initiative is to close gaps in eco -
nomic and financial statistics that became 
apparent  during the global financial crisis. For 
the IIP , each of the G20 countries is requested 
to supply a breakdown of its asset and liability 
positions in the most important currencies. In 
addition, domestic sectors are to be broken 
down into greater detail than before.
The persistence of unhealthy macroeconomic 
developments can be evaluated more compre -
hensively and reliably by using stock variables 
than by only considering the underlying flows.10 
It is possible, for example, that a current ac -
count surplus and the concomitant transaction- 
related rise in net claims may be more than off -
set by negative valuation effects; this may be 
the case especially for strong revaluations on 
the financial markets.
The EU’s Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure 
(MIP)11 therefore includes a limit not only for 
the current account balance as an external indi -
cator but also for the net external position. If a 
member state’s net external liabilities exceed 
35% of GDP , the European Commission will 
conduct an in- depth analysis. In the past, high net liabilities in particular have proven to be un -
sustainable. The reason why no limit has been 
placed on net external assets is that a high 
creditor position is not considered, per se,  to 
be problematic for a member state or for the 
functioning of the monetary union.12
Three- dimensional account 
system for changes in the 
net IIP
Between 2007 and 2017, Germany’s net assets 
vis- à- vis  non- residents increased by €1,457 bil -

tion to GDP . In order, first, to analyse the fac -
tors underlying this growth, and, second, to

functional categories of assets and the distribu -
tion across domestic sectors, the IIP offers a 
three- dimensional account system. This con -
sistent framework illustrates changes in the net 
IIP in an income, instrument and sector ac -
count. The income account establishes the link 
to the balance of payments, the instrument 
account  shows how changes in the net IIP are 
reflected in the various functional categories of 
financial assets, and the sector account con -
siders the domestic sectors involved.13
When combined, these three dimensions pro -
vide a comprehensive “data cube”, from which 
any number of sections can be examined for a 
variety of analytical purposes. If several attrib -
utes are to be combined, “slices” of the cube 
can be configured. For example, it is possible to 
cut out the direct investment “slice” and study 
how growth in the net external position is dis -
tributed across domestic sectors in this func -
tional category or what contribution valuation 
effects make to the overall change in net direct 
investment. If attributes from all three dimen -
sions are selected, the focus lies on a single 
small cuboid or data point, such as examining 
the extent to which market price effects have 
impacted on the government’s long- term debt 
securities.The cube does not necessarily need to include 
net values; it is also possible to depict the asset 
or liability side separately. In principle, this data 
cube for the IIP can be extended by adding 
extra features – eg, a currency breakdown and 
partner countries – to make it a hypercube. The 
provision of the IIP data cube in a system of 
internationally harmonised time series keys 
makes it significantly easier to analyse these 
data in practice.14
IIP income account
The income account allows for the macroeco -
nomic context, dissecting the build- up in exter -
nal assets into several components. The chart 
on page 33 shows clearly that the positive cur -
rent account balance between 2007 and 2017 
was the driving force behind the growth in 
Germany’s net external assets. The latter did, 
however, lag behind the current account sur -
pluses, which added up to €2,173 billion over 
the entire period.15 The difference between the 
cumulative current account surpluses and the 
rise in net external assets of €716 billion is due 
to valuation effects,16 the impact of financial 
derivatives,17 and other adjustments, all of

which have a negative sign.18 The crisis years of 
2007, 2008 and 2011 were particularly striking, 
when Germany’s net external assets declined 
despite surpluses in the current account be -
cause the total of the negative effects exceeded 
the positive balance of payments transactions.
Valuation effects,19 consisting of market price 
and exchange rate effects, largely balanced 
each other out (-€75 billion) in the period under 
review. The setbacks from the crisis years were 
followed by a countermovement: immediately 
after the financial crisis began, from the start of 
2007 until the end of 2011, the net external 
position was hit by valuation losses amounting 
to €208 billion. This has turned around since 
the start of 2012 as the financial markets have 
slowly stabilised, and Germany’s external assets 
recorded valuation gains of €133 billion. The 
different trends during the two periods are pri -
marily due to market price effects. Exchange 
rate effects played only a minor role on balance 
because movements in individual years, albeit considerable, were in opposite directions and 
thus largely offset each other during the two 
periods.
The net valuation effects described here are 
calculated from the difference between the im -
pact of market prices and exchange rates on 
external assets and liabilities. An increase in 
liabilities   caused by valuation effects reduces 
the net external position. If there is a broad-  
based appreciation of the euro, exchange rate 
effects will cause foreign currency investments 
which are converted into euro on the balance 
sheet to decline in value on both sides of the 
balance sheet. The net effect of an appreci -Differing market

ation or depreciation therefore ultimately 
depends  on the currency composition of the 
external assets and liabilities. Since the foreign 
currency investments on the asset side exceed 
those on the liability side in Germany’s IIP , an 
appreciation of the domestic currency will 
result , all other things being equal, in net valu -
ation losses and a decline in the net external 
position. A similarly nuanced approach, which 
takes instrument structure into account, has to 
be taken when considering the net effect of 
market price changes on the respective asset 
and liability positions.
For example, in 2017, a record- high valuation 
adjustment of €123 billion due to exchange 
rate movements was carried out. Last year, the 
euro recorded significant gains primarily on 
account   of the favourable economic data in 
the euro area, after having first dropped to its 
lowest level in 14 years at the end of 2016. The 
euro closed 2017 with an increase of around 
14% on the US dollar, which is by far the most important foreign currency in Germany’s IIP .20 
While the euro appreciation resulted in lower 
valuations of €207 billion on the asset side, 
downward revisions on the liability side only 
came to €84 billion, resulting in the aforemen -
tioned negative net exchange rate effects 
which reduced Germany’s net external position 
by over 6% in 2017.
This mirrors the high level of foreign currency 
exposure in absolute terms, which is defined as 
the difference between foreign currency assets 
and foreign currency liabilities. Exposure 
doubled during the period under review and 
made up almost half of German GDP by the 
end of 2017, reaching around €1.5 trillion. 
Nevertheless, Germany’s IIP is seeing a long-  
term trend decline in the share of foreign cur -
rency, not least because a single currency area 
has emerged with the European monetary 
union, which has opened up investment poten -
tial outside of Germany’s economy without the 
need to take up foreign currency positions. On 
the asset side, the share denominated in for -
eign currencies has fallen from 45% to 33% 
from the start of the monetary union to the 
end of 2017, while on the liability side this fig -
ure fell from 21% to 19%.
In order to better explain the impact of ex -
change rate effects, the Bundesbank has de -
veloped the indices of IIP- weighted exchange 
rate effects  (IIE), which are expanded on more 
fully in the box on pages 36 and 37. These in -
dices, which are based on the IIP’s currency 
composition, show the impact of exchange 
rates on aggregate positions and on individual 
functional categories of assets and sectors, and 
can also be used for sensitivity analyses. The 
data are available immediately after the end of 
each quarter and therefore have a three- month 
lead on IIP statistics. For instance, the indices Strong euro

20 The Bundesbank has published a currency breakdown

began to carry out a more differentiated currency break -

for the first quarter of 2018 indicate exchange 
rate losses of 0.35% (around -€29 billion) on 
the asset side compared to the preceding quar -
ter, and of 0.20% (around -€13 billion) on the 
liability  side. It is therefore already foreseeable 
that exchange rate effects will reduce the net 
external position compared to the end of 2017.
Excursus: interpreting 
valuation  effects
As a rule, valuation effects should be inter -
preted with a degree of caution. Valuations are 
corrected to comply with the accounting con -
vention that IIP stocks should be reported at 
market values, where possible. Thus, the values 
recorded in the IIP do not reflect realised gains 
or losses. It should also be noted, especially 
from a sectoral perspective, that net external 
assets capture only part of the financial assets 
of that sector. Hedging activities which invest -
ors may have used to eliminate valuation risks 
in full or in part, meaning that open positions 
are transferred to other domestic or foreign 
sectors, are not taken into account either. This 
is information which the IIP either does not col -
lect for conceptual reasons or cannot provide 
due to the method of data collection. There -
fore, the valuation effects shown in the IIP can -
not simply be equated with realised losses and 
gains.
Particular issues may arise as a result of mark -
ing sovereign bonds to market. In the crisis 
period from 2007 to 2011, the prices of Ger -
man government bonds increased, which 
meant that the value of foreign investors’ hold -
ings rose by a total of €133 billion. This higher- 
rated sovereign debt on the liability side alone 
caused net external assets as reported at the 
end of 2011 to fall by 5 percentage points in 
relation to GDP . Meanwhile, the German gov -
ernment’s payment obligations remained un -
changed as the nominal amount has to be 
repaid  upon maturity. With the opposite sign, 
this chain of causality can lead to the following 
valuation paradox in crisis countries. The fur -ther a country moves towards insolvency, the 
better its reported net external position be -
comes. Given that prices for government bonds 
at risk of default fall, these liabilities are also 
given a lower valuation in the IIP , although the 
crisis country’s payment obligations remain 
unchanged .21
Investment income under 
the IIP income account
The income account also decomposes the 
change in net external assets into the current 
account balance excluding investment income 
(external primary account balance) on the one 
hand and the total return on net IIP on the 
other. The latter is defined as valuation effects 
plus the balance of cross- border investment 
income . In order to depict investment income 
as part of the change in net external assets, the 
income account uses the correlations in the 
balance of payments. Instead of defining the 
changes in net external assets as the sum of 
the financial account balance, valuation ef -
fects, and other adjustments, as per usual, a 
link is established to the current account bal -
ance, with the balance of cross- border invest -
ment income contained therein being pre -
sented separately.22
Investment income is shown separately as it 
is determined by the volume and structure of 
outstanding external assets and liabilities. The 
same applies to valuation effects. Taken to -
gether, investment income and valuation ef -
fects can be interpreted as the total return on 
individual IIP positions or net external assets. 
The income account thus shows the feedback 
loop between financial stocks and the resulting Caution is

in place that nominal values be reported as supplementary 
information. See IMF (2009), Balance of Payments and 
International Investment Position Manual, Sixth Edition 
(BPM6), p 125.

applies to the balance of payments’ sub- accounts. Finan -

New indices of exchange rate effects in the international 
investment position
A notable percentage of fi  nancial assets 
and liabilities in Germany’s international in-
vestment position (IIP) are denominated in a 
foreign currency (see page 34 of the main 
article). Exchange rate movements there-
fore have a major impact on trends in the 
IIP . A newly developed index concept now 
allows more in- depth analyses. The indices 
of IIP- weighted exchange rate effects (IIE) 
show how the value of external assets 
changes solely as a result of exchange rate 
movements.
IIE are highly granular and allow conclu-
sions to be drawn about the impact of 
changes in the prices of individual curren-
cies on asset and liability holdings broken 
down by sector and instrument. The con-
cept is based on a system of weighted ex-
change rates. The index system weights are 
based on IIP stocks broken down by cur-
rency, sector and asset class and listed sep-
arately for assets and liabilities.1 The choice 
of disaggregated weighting units permits 
aggregation at any level along the dimen-
sions currency, sector and asset class.
The calculation of the IIP- weighted indices 
of exchange rate effects encompasses the 
US dollar, pound sterling, Japanese yen, 
Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Chinese 
renminbi. In addition, the weighting matrix 
must take into account the large percent-
age of euro on the asset and liability sides, 
which dampens the effect of exchange rate 
movements on the aggregate market value 
of foreign assets.
The weighting matrix further includes the 
asset classes reported on in the IIP (see 
page 38). In a sectoral account, the weight-
ing matrix is based on the core sectors out-
lined in the IIP (see page 39), with fi  nancial corporations broken down into the sub- 
sectors central bank, credit institutions, 
money market funds and other fi  nancial 
corporations.
The weighting of the IIE is based on the 
most recent data available, as abrupt 
transaction- related adjustments of asset or 
liability positions in the IIP cannot be ruled 
out. On the basis of the quarterly IIP data, 
which has been available broken down by 
currency since the end of 2012, a chained 
Laspeyres index for exchange rates is con-
structed. The chain links are as follows:

using the direct quotation method (eg 
US$1 = €0.88). There is no exchange 
rate conversion for any euro- 
denominated assets, ie E = 1.
1 By contrast, the trade- weighted nominal effective 
exchange rates that the Bundesbank has been calcu-
lating since the early 1970s condense developments in 
bilateral exchange rates into a single index, which can 
be used, for example, to measure the impact of ex-
change rate movements on a country’s or a currency 
area’s price competitiveness (see Deutsche Bundes-
bank, Adjustments in the calculation of effective ex-
change rates and indicators of price competitiveness in 
August 2013, Monthly Report, August 2013, pp 50-
52; and Deutsche Bundesbank, Recalculated weights

tiveness, Monthly Report, August 2017, pp 41-43).Deutsche Bundesbank

In order to obtain an index (including for 
developments over several periods), the 
quarterly links are chain- linked through 
continuous multiplication:
(2) IIEt =  100· IE1·IE2·…·IEt
= IIEt–1·IEt
IIEt refers to the index value at time t , 
where the value for the fourth quarter of 
the initial year is made to equal 100 as the 
reference period (ie 2012 Q4 = 100). The 
term in equation (2) after the second equals 
sign indicates that a current index value is 
created by multiplying the previous value 
with the current chain link. An increase in 
the IIE represents a stock- weighted depreci-
ation of the euro and thus an increase in 
asset or debt levels after conversion into the 
single currency.
The IIE have similar characteristics to the 
better- known chain indices of the annual- 
overlap or monthly- overlap type, which are 
used, for instance, to calculate price- 
adjusted gross domestic product or har-
monised consumer prices. The chain- linked 
use of weights may cause statistical distor-
tions in the form of “path dependencies”2 
over the longer term, as a result of which it 
may no longer be possible to clearly distin-
guish between exchange rate and structural 
effects in international assets.As when analysing other chain indices, 
there are programmes available for the IIE3 
that allow the growth contributions to the 
exchange rate- related percentage change 
in an aggregate to be calculated. For ex-
ample, the sectors’ arithmetic growth con-
tributions to the percentage change in port-
folio investment as a whole can be deter-
mined.
The IIE allow exchange rate- related wealth 
effects, which the IIP would only show with 
a lag of three months, to be approximated 
in a timely manner based on current ex-
change rates. Methodologically advanced 
risk analyses can also be carried out. In add-
ition, sensitivity analyses can be used to 
identify individual sectors which would, in 
certain scenarios, be majorly affected by 
(assumed) changes in the prices of individ-
ual currencies. In addition, methods for 
analysing time series can be applied to the 
indices, for example to measure the ex-
change rate- related volatility of the market 
value of individual asset holdings.
When interpreting the IIE as a measure of 
risk for changes in the value of assets in in-
dividual domestic sectors as a result of ex-
change rate movements, it should be noted, 
however, that the hedging operations 
which fi  nancial market players use to re-
duce their currency risk are not taken into 
consideration. Moreover, no account is 
taken of individual enterprises’ option of 
offsetting their exchange rate risk within an 
international group.

Accounts  2008 (2008 SNA), No 15.43, p 300.

income-  relevant revenue or expenditure. The 
external primary account balance, which does 
not depend on the volume and structure of the 
current IIP , is captured separately. It encom -
passes the current account balance less invest -
ment income plus the quantitatively negligible 
capital account balance.23
In cumulated terms, the balance of investment 
income over the reporting period from 2007 to 
2017 came to €595 billion. A significant part of 
the total increase in net assets of €1,457 billion 
is thus attributable to the remuneration of past 
current account surpluses. Surpluses thus con -
tain a self- perpetuating element as they are 
usually linked to the accumulation of yield-  
bearing assets, and the resulting capital gains, 
in turn, have a positive effect on the current 
account. However, since 2012, growth in net 
investment income has no longer kept pace 
with that of net external assets. The unchanged 
positive accumulation effects on net invest -
ment income have been offset by negative 
yield effects.24 Hence, the downward trend in 
net investment income as a percentage of net 
IIP can be explained, first, by the yield level 
effect , reflecting the global decline in interest 
rates. Second, the continued positive yield dif -
ferential has slightly declined as the yields on 
German external assets fell more sharply than 
those on external liabilities. This development 
was particularly pronounced in the case of 
long-  term debt securities, where the counter -
movement to the previously high spreads on 
the bond markets as a result of the crisis is 
likely to have played a role.
IIP instrument account
The IIP instrument account shows which invest -
ment and financing instruments account for 
the net increase, broken down into the five 
functional categories direct investment, port -
folio investment, financial derivatives, other in -
vestment, and reserve assets, which are each 
broken down further. The individual investment 
categories feature different investment targets, payment obligations and potential return, but 
also different exposures to loss. Over the entire 
period from 2007 to 2017, the strongest 
growth was recorded in portfolio investment 
(+€738 billion), followed by direct investment 
(+€382 billion) and other investment (+€273 
billion). The expansion in reserve assets (+€82 
billion) was mainly due to a higher valuation for 
gold holdings. The net stock of financial deriva -
tives dropped slightly (-€18 billion).
The growth in portfolio investment has been 
very uneven. Between 2007 and 2011, net 
portfolio investment initially fell by €330 billion, 
mainly due to valuation adjustments. In the 
subsequent period, it recorded a very pro -
nounced increase. With a, mainly transaction-  
related, increase in the amount of €1,068 bil -
lion, portfolio investment accounted for over 
80% of the growth in net external assets dur -
ing this period. Against this backdrop, the bal -
ance of portfolio investment moved into posi -
tive territory for the first time in more than 30 
years during 2015.
The development in portfolio investment is, not 
least, attributable to changes in the ownership 
structure of long- term German government Investment

23 The analysis of public budget deficits, too, makes a dis -
tinction between interest payments on outstanding debt 
and the primary balance. This is done, inter alia, in the con -
text of sustainability calculations to determine how high 
the primary surplus needs to be given a certain interest bur -
den in order to stabilise the debt- to- GDP ratio. The Euro -
pean Commission conducts similar sustainability analyses 
for IIP and the current account balance, where, in a next 
step, the current account balance, which is defined as the 
benchmark, could be broken down further into the bal -
ance of investment income and the external primary bal -
ance. See European Commission (2017), Alert Mechanism 
Report 2018, p 7; and European Commission (2016), The 
macroeconomic imbalance procedure. Rationale, process,

tional Paper 39, November, p 86.

debt securities. Attracted by the excellent credit 
rating and outstanding liquidity of Federal 
bonds, non- resident investors have generally 
been net buyers year after year. However, the 
statistics show that, since 2015, non- resident 
investors have shorted Federal securities on 
balance. As a result, the government’s reported 
external debt through this instrument has 
dropped by €312 billion, or around one- quarter, 
over the past three years. Since March 2015, 
the one- off effect of the Eurosystem’s public 
sector purchase programme (PSPP) has been a 
major factor in this development.
IIP sector account
The IIP sector account shows sectoral net IIP 
growth, broken down into the domestic core 
sectors government, central bank, monetary 
financial   institutions (MFIs),25 financial corpor -
ations without MFIs, as well as the sector non- 
financial corporations, households and non-  
profit institutions serving households.26 This 
helps identify both structural changes in the 
individual sectors’ asset and liability positions 
and sectoral shifts. Here, too, the financial crisis 
has clearly left its mark.
Since the beginning of 2007, MFIs have re -
duced their net position vis- à- vis  non- residents 
by €95 billion; overall, their net external assets 
had contracted to €294 billion at the end of 
2017. Even more pronounced than the decline 
in the net position was the drop in gross figures 
due to the deleveraging process in the wake of 
the financial crisis, namely by €359 billion on 
the asset side and €253 billion on the liability 
side.27 In recent years, the decline in MFIs’ net 
external assets has been related to the impact 
of the APP . There was a decline, in particular, in 
the net position of MFIs in other investment, 
which reflects deposits of foreign commercial 
banks domiciled either inside or outside the 
euro area with credit institutions domiciled in 
Germany. These deposits increased, inter alia,  
as a result of non- resident investors selling their 
securities to the Eurosystem – ie not only to the Bundesbank, but also to other national central 
banks and the ECB – sales which are settled by 
commercial banks domiciled in Germany.28
In such cases, the deposits of foreign commer -
cial banks represent a counterpart to the Bun -
desbank’s increased TARGET2 claims on the 
ECB. All in all, the Bundesbank’s net external 
assets rose by €502 billion between 2007 and 
2017, in particular due to the increase in 
TARGET2 claims. With net external assets worth 
€471 billion at the end of 2017, the Bundes -
bank is the second- largest domestic net cred -
itor sector, after it had been a net borrower at 
the beginning of the reference period.
The largest net creditor by far, however, is the 
enterprises and households sector, which saw 
its net external assets expand by €1,197 billion 
from early 2007 to €1,981 billion at the end of 
2017. At €1,845 billion, the sub- sector financial 
corporations without MFIs accounts for the 
bulk of this position, including mutual funds, 
insurers, and pension funds. In view of the an -
ticipated population ageing in Germany, this 
position can mainly be attributed to the fact 
that investors are making provisions for their 
future financing needs.
These corporations are chiefly invested in for -
eign shares and debt securities. Around 80% 
of their net external assets are in the portfolio 
invest ment category, which is particularly 
affected   by market price developments in the 
equity and bond markets. By contrast, the

tutions serving households, mainly acts as a dir -
ect investor or represents the destination for 
foreign equity capital. However, given the high 
amounts on both sides of the balance sheet 
(€1,980 billion in assets and €1,844 billion in

are relatively low.
The sole net debtor vis- à- vis  non- residents is 
the government sector. Although general gov -
ernment increased its liabilities overall during 
the period starting in 2007 by a further €146 
billion to €818 billion at the end of 2017, the 
picture has changed over the last three years. 
The combination of rising budget surpluses and 
the Eurosystem’s securities purchases under the 
APP has caused German government debt to 
fall significantly vis- à- vis  non- residents.
Conclusion
As a result of implementing the methodological 
manual BPM6, the German IIP statistics have matured into a comprehensive database, enab -
ling the Bundesbank to fulfil the reporting 
require  ments of European and international 
organ isations in terms of IIP data. The IIP now 
provides detailed data relating to the nature of 
stock changes, functional asset category, sec -
tor, currency, and partner country, opening up 
a broad scope for analyses across a wide range 
of issues. The three- dimensional concept pre -
sented here, and applied by way of example, 
expands the analytical framework for IIP stock 
variables by enabling a consistent and compre -
hensive overview of the changes in external 
assets and liabilities in terms of their determin -
ants, investment structure, and distribution 
across the domestic sectors. Furthermore, the 
indices of IIP- weighted exchange rate effects 
provide opportunities for data analysis, not 
least as part of sensitivity analyses.Government

Current regulatory developments in the 
field of payments and in the settlement 
of securities and derivatives
The field of payments and the financial market infrastructure have evolved considerably in recent 
years. The Eurosystem has made substantial contributions in this regard with its TARGET2 and 
TARGET2-Securities payment and settlement systems, which were discussed at length in the 
Bundes bank’s December 2017 Monthly Report. At the same time, however, regulation also has a 
significant impact on developments in these areas. The backdrop to this is that resilient financial 
market infrastructures are of major importance owing to their central functions for the financial 
system and the real economy. In order to ensure the secure settlement of payments as well as 
securities and derivatives transactions, the principles for financial market infrastructures (PFMI) 
were adopted by the G20 countries back in 2012. In keeping with these principles, the focus in 
recent years has consequently been on establishing them in a binding manner for payment 
systems , central securities depositories and central counterparties. The main subject of the current 
debate is the revision of the supervisory and regulatory framework for central counterparties that 
has been in place since 2012. The framework in the European Union currently being discussed 
envisages a stronger role for central banks and the European Securities and Markets Authority 
(ESMA), and, in particular, a tighter regime for the supervision of central counterparties in non- EU 
countries. This aspect has become particularly important in light of the forthcoming withdrawal 
of the United Kingdom from the European Union. In order to assess possible policy options, the 
Bundesbank is primarily concerned with the security of payment transactions and the settlement 
of securities and derivatives transactions. In addition, the recovery and resolution of central coun -
terparties is, in future, to be harmonised throughout Europe by implementing international stand -
ards. The requirements for the monitoring of systemically important payment systems have been 
tightened in order, amongst other things, to counter the mounting threat of cyber crime and to 
give the supervising central banks new review and evaluation rights. Especially with regard to the 
increased threat situation, sustained efforts are needed in the area of financial market infrastruc -
tures, but also in the financial sector as a whole, to improve cyber resilience. In the EU payments 
landscape, the regulations are being amended significantly with the implementation of the 
second Payment Services Directive (PSD2), which pursues the main goal of deepening market inte -
gration within the European Union and strengthening competition. In particular, the possibility for 
account holders to grant third parties access to an account, which is also referred to as “open 
banking” in the current debate, may be a catalyst for significant structural changes in the pay -
ment services market.Deutsche Bundesbank

Financial market infrastruc -
tures and payment services
In response to the lessons learned from the 
financial  crisis, regulation of the financial mar -
kets has been tightened significantly in recent 
years. In addition to further developing bank -
ing regulation, the rules for settling payments 
as well as securities and derivatives transactions 
were also revised and toughened. This was 
based on the principles for financial market in -
frastructures1 (PFMI) agreed upon internation -
ally by the G20 countries in 2012, which are 
also widely recognised beyond these countries. 
These principles formulate standardised re -
quirements for risk management, administra -
tive structures and the transparency of financial 
market infrastructures. The latter play a major 
role in the financial system as they are used, 
amongst other things, to settle financial trans -
actions. They concentrate risks and can, owing 
to their central function in the closely inter -
twined network of the financial sector, become 
a major contagion channel in crisis situations. 
The financial market infrastructures (see the 
chart on page 43) include:
– Payment systems
Participants use these systems to process 
their payments. In some cases, payment sys -
tems are also used by other financial market 
infrastructures for the purpose of money 
settlement.
– Central securities depositories (CSDs)
Nowadays, securities are almost always held 
with CSDs. Investors receive the associated 
ownership rights via a safe custody account, 
which is held by the investor’s bank at a 
CSD.
– Securities settlement systems (SSSs)
These are run by CSDs to, for example in the 
case of a purchase, transfer securities by book entry from one safe custody account 
to another with settlement finality.
– Central counterparties (CCPs)
These entities take over the clearing – ie the 
transmission, reconciliation and netting as 
well as the risk management – of pending 
securities and derivatives transactions up 
until their maturity, interposing themselves 
between two trading partners. The risk pos -
itions associated with clearing are calculated 
by the CCP in a timely manner and on an 
ongoing basis and are secured by means of 
collateral provided by the contracting par -
ties.
– Trade repositories (TRs)2
Trade repositories maintain a centralised and 
standardised record of transaction and pos -
ition data for derivatives transactions.
Within the EU, the PFMIs have achieved a bind -
ing character for certain financial market infra -
structures (eg for CCPs, CSDs and systemically 
important payment systems) through their con -
sistent implementation in the shape of Euro -
pean legislation. The legal framework thus cre -
ated is constantly being developed further in 
order to take account of current developments 
and findings.
In addition to strengthening the security and 
efficiency of the financial market infrastructures 
to protect against crises, the legal framework 
for the provision of payment services is also to 
be fundamentally revised to promote innov -
ation and consumer rights with the aim of sup -
porting convergence in the European single 
payments market.Principles for

Central counterparties
CCPs are a central component of the financial 
market infrastructure and serve, amongst other 
things, to mitigate risks in the financial system 
and to facilitate the settlement of transactions. 
As a central counterparty, they interpose them -
selves between the parties to financial transac -
tions that take place at a trading venue (eg a 
stock exchange) or also outside trading venues 
(over- the- counter (OTC) transactions). A central 
counterparty acts as the buyer to the seller and 
as the seller to the buyer and thus ensures per -
formance of the contract on behalf of both 
parties. CCPs therefore always have a balanced 
book under normal business operations, ie for 
each position assumed by a CCP for a market 
participant, there is a matching position with 
another market participant. In this vein, they 
act as risk managers for their clearing members 
and only to a lesser degree as risk bearers.3 In 
terms of risk management, the CCP uses its 
equity capital only to a lesser extent, instead 
primarily making use of the resources of its 
clearing members. These must pledge collateral 
for the transactions that they conduct (known 
as initial margins) and pay into a default fund 
as a supplementary insurance arrangement 
supported by all members to protect the sys -
tem as a whole. The use of a CCP not only 
helps market participants to mitigate their credit risk exposures to their counterparties, 
but also allows them to reduce their funding 
and capital costs by netting countervailing 
transactions in their overall portfolio.
CCPs usually have quasi- monopoly positions in 
sub- markets and, being systemically important 
financial market infrastructures, they cannot be 
readily replaced. Since the decision made by 
G20 leaders in Pittsburgh in 2009 to settle all 
standardised OTC derivatives transactions via 
CCPs, the importance of CCPs for the function -
ing of the financial system has increased fur -
ther.4 This is why particular attention is being 
paid to CCPs at the national, European and 
international level, and also by the Bundes -
bank.

(European Market Infrastructure Regulation: 
EMIR5), which came into force on 16 August 
2012 as well as with supplementary regulatory 
technical standards (RTS). With the EMIR, the 
CCPs in the EU were subject to a uniform 
supervisory and monitoring framework for the 
first time. The German CCPs – Eurex Clearing 
AG and European Commodity Clearing AG – 
received EMIR authorisation in April and June 
2014, respectively. In addition to articulating 
supervisory requirements for CCPs, the EMIR 
also legally enshrines, amongst other things, 
the tasks and cooperation of the authorities in 
the supervision and authorisation of CCPs, the 
obligation to settle certain OTC derivatives via 
CCPs (clearing obligation) and also reporting 
obligations for derivatives contracts. The EMIR 
also provides recognition regimes for CCPs 
domiciled in non- EU countries wishing to offer 
services in the EU. One of the conditions for 
recognising such CCPs is that the non- EU coun -
try’s supervisory and regulatory framework is 
equivalent to the EMIR.
Back in 2015, the European Commission began 
reviewing the regulatory framework, as envis -
aged in the EMIR. This review is also part of the 
European Commission’s Regulatory Fitness and 
Performance Programme (REFIT) which aims to 
simplify European legislation and, in particular, 
to reduce bureaucracy and cut the costs to so -
ciety as a whole.
Following the completion of this review, the 
European Commission put forward a proposal 
in May 2017 for a regulation to amend the 
EMIR.6 This proposal foresees just minor 
changes on balance. One is to simplify the 
existing rules on the suspension of the clearing 
obligation and to allow them to be applied 
more quickly than in the past, if necessary. An -
other is to create incentives for central clearing 
and improve access to CCPs. The proposal also 
aims to ensure greater transparency surround -
ing the calculation of collateral requirements by 
CCPs.Proposals regarding the 
supervision  of non- EU CCPs 
and the amendment of the 
CCP supervisory regime for 
EU CCPs
Furthermore, the importance of the CCP busi -
ness has increased significantly, owing, inter 
alia, to the obligation to clear standardised 
OTC transactions via CCPs. On account of the 
global market structure, a concentration of 
CCPs in non- EU countries cannot be ruled out. 
The current recognition procedure no longer 
takes sufficient account of this. The problem of 
overseeing and supervising non- EU CCPs in 
Europe  is being accentuated in particular by 
the forthcoming withdrawal of the United 
Kingdom from the EU (“Brexit”), as a large pro -
portion of OTC interest rate and credit deriva -
tives are currently cleared via CCPs in London.
As things currently stand, UK  CCPs still fall 
within the supervisory and regulatory perimeter 
laid down by the EMIR. Following the effective 
withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the 
European single market, a situation could arise 
where UK CCPs are automatically declared to 
be non-  EU CCPs, unless subsequent arrange -
ments are made in the meantime. Transactions 
conducted in the United Kingdom would then 
fall outside the common European supervisory 
and regulatory framework. This was one of the 
reasons why the European Commission put EMIR review

forward  a further proposal in June 2017 for a 
revised  version of the EMIR (EMIR II).7
The European Commission proposes making 
the future supervision of non- EU CCPs by EU 
authorities contingent on their classification in 
terms of systemic importance. In future, for 
example , the requirements for a non-  EU CCP 
should vary according to its degree of systemic 
importance for financial stability in the EU as a 
whole or in one or more member states. For 
non- systemically important non- EU CCPs 
(“Tier 1” CCPs), the current procedure for 
assess ing the equivalence of the supervisory 
and regulatory framework with the EMIR will 
continue to apply. However, systemically im -
portant non- EU CCPs (“Tier 2” CCPs) would 
have to meet key EMIR requirements and sub -
mit to extensive monitoring and information 
exchange rights of the European Securities and 
Market Authority (ESMA). A legal opinion 
should be available confirming that the ESMA 
is able to enforce these rights in the non-  EU 
country. In the case of substantially systemically 
important CCPs, the European Commission 
could also, on the ESMA’s recommendation, 
adopt an implementing act according to which 
such a CCP would only be allowed to offer its 
services within the EU if it is authorised to do 
so and is thus also domiciled in the EU (“loca -
tion requirement”). This may be necessary in 
particular if the risks which a substantially sys -
temically important non- EU CCP presents to 
financial  stability in the EU or in an EU member 
state would not be sufficiently mitigated des -
pite compliance with strict prudential provi -
sions. From the Bundesbank’s perspective, the 
three- stage approach of the European Com -
mission generally provides an appropriate 
framework to take account  of the varying sys -
temic importance of CCPs.
The organisation of intra- European supervision 
is another area where the European Commis -
sion is proposing two major changes: strength -
ening the ESMA’s role in the supervision of 
EU CCPs, and involving the relevant central 
bank of issue (CBI) to a greater degree. For ex -ample, the national competent authorities for 
CCPs – in Germany the Federal Financial Super -
visory Authority (BaFin) – would, in future, have 
to obtain the ESMA’s approval for important 
decisions in connection with the supervision of 
CCPs. It is also proposed that a CCP Executive 
Session be set up within the ESMA, which 
would be responsible for general tasks related 
to CCPs and the supervision of EU CCPs and 
non- EU CCPs. From the Bundesbank’s perspec -
tive, these proposals should be viewed critically 
as the approach adopted so far – besides only 
coming into force just a short time ago – has 
by and large proven its worth, and the innov -
ations are likely to complicate, rather than sim -
plify the supervisory regime.
The European Commission’s proposal, on the 
other hand, which foresees giving the central 
bank of issue a greater role in future in terms of 
authorisation and ongoing supervision, is to be 
viewed differently. Since negative effects on 
the smooth functioning of payment systems, 
on the liquidity management of clearing par -
ticipants and on the general liquidity situation 
on the money market need to be prevented, the 
greater say this proposal would give the CBI 
would have more of a bearing on the CCP’s risk 
management. The Eurosystem already assumes  
the role of the CBI for the euro, mainly through 
participation in the existing EMIR colleges of 
supervisors for CCPs. For CCPs domiciled in the 
euro area, the Eurosystem is normally repre -
sented by the national central bank in the CCP’s 
home country. For CCPs outside the euro area, 
this task is performed by the European Central 
Bank (ECB). In both cases, the CBI’s decision-  
making process for the euro is carried out via 
the Eurosystem’s decision- making bodies, the 
decisions of which are binding for the respect -
ive representative. Accordingly, the Bundes -Non- EU CCPs

ESMA should be 
viewed critically7 Proposal of 13 June 2017 for a regulation of the Euro -
pean Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation

Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority) and

bank represents the Eurosystem as the CBI in 
dealings with the German CCPs Eurex Clearing 
AG and European Commodity Clearing AG.
In order for the Eurosystem to be able to 
perform  its role as a central bank of issue in 
accord ance with the proposed revised version 
of the EMIR with legal certainty, the Governing 
Council of the ECB decided to issue a recom -
mendation to the European Parliament and the 
Council of the European Union to amend the 
Statute of the European System of Central 
Banks (ESCB) and of the ECB8 in order to pro -
vide a clear legal basis for regulatory compe -
tences in the area of central clearing for finan -
cial instruments.
Recovery and resolution 
of CCPs
The increased importance of CCPs makes it all 
the more crucial to ensure that CCPs are secure 
and resilient in crisis situations. The minimum 
standards for CCP risk management laid down 
in the EMIR are generally designed to ensure 
that a CCP can cover the losses from the simul -
taneous default of the two clearing members 
with the largest risk positions under extreme 
but plausible market conditions. For this pur -
pose, CCPs hold prefunded resources in the 
form of margins and a default fund. For more 
intense stress situations, there are currently 
only international standards and guidelines in 
place, according to which such losses must be 
covered but not prefunded. There are no statu -
tory EU provisions, however. A forthcoming EU 
regulation for a recovery and resolution regime 
is to close this regulatory gap.9 Both the recov -
ery and the resolution of a CCP are intended to 
safeguard financial stability and to ensure that 
the critical functions of the CCP are maintained, 
while minimising the use of public funds to 
protect taxpayers to as great an extent as pos -
sible. Regular insolvency proceedings, on the 
other hand, could jeopardise these objectives, 
since they would primarily serve to satisfy the 
insolvency creditors.The viability of a CCP as a going concern can 
be jeopardised by two types of risk. The first 
involves losses from the default of clearing 
members which are unable to meet their finan -
cial obligations (default losses). The second re -
lates to other losses such as those arising from 
operational or investment risks (non-  default 
losses).
If a clearing member were to default, this 
would cause an imbalance in the CCP’s other -
wise matched book.10 This is generally why 
position allocation tools and loss allocation 
tools are needed. Position allocation tools may 
include the voluntary participation of clearing 
members in auctions or bilateral sales of the 
defaulting clearing member’s positions. A fur -
ther, enforceable position allocation tool is the 
close-  out of positions of non-  defaulting clear -
ing members holding counter positions to the 
defaulting clearing member (tear- up or termin -
ation). Such close- out operations may result in 
losses that are not covered by the collateral11 
furnished by the defaulting clearing member or 
the additional amount of the CCP’s dedicated 
own resources. Certain position and loss alloca -
tion tools are already provided for today as part 
of the regular default management framework, 
above all the use of resources from the pre -
funded default fund.12 Other instruments are

regulation, including the possibility of allocat -
ing losses by requesting cash calls from surviv -
ing clearing members (assignments) or apply -
ing haircuts to the variation margin gains of 
those clearing participants receiving payments 
from the CCP (gains based haircutting).
The table above provides an overview of the 
resources available to a CCP to cover losses 
associated  with a member’s default pursuant 
to the EMIR as well as possible recovery meas -
ures should these resources prove insufficient.
The draft regulation stipulates that European 
CCPs will have to submit recovery plans in 
future  which, in particular, include the identifi -
cation of critical functions, the stress scenarios, 
a description of the recovery tools and the 
criteria  for triggering their deployment.
While a default by a clearing member can nor -
mally be managed by a CCP autonomously, for 
the most part, as part of its risk management 
framework, implementing the more extensive 
measures needed for recovery, though likewise 
a matter for the CCP itself to handle, requires 
greater involvement on the part of the author -
ities. According to the draft regulation, recov -
ery planning will involve the CCP’s competent 
supervisory authority and a college whose 
members are expected to include, inter alia,  the supervisory and resolution authorities for 
major clearing members. Not only would this 
take into account the interests and capabilities 
of the clearing members; it would also under -
line that responsibility for having adequate 
levels of risk provisioning lies with the clearing 
members and their respective competent 
author ities.
The resolution of a CCP , on the other hand, 
would be carried out by the competent reso -
lution authority. The tools used for this purpose 
are, in some cases, identical to those used for a 
recovery. In addition to these, it is envisaged 
that the resolution authorities will have further 
tools at their disposal, such as the sale of busi -
ness and bridge CCP tools.

Central securities depositories (CSDs) provide 
important services for banks with regard to the 
safe custody, administration and settlement of 
securities which indirectly benefit banks’ cus -
tomers. In the European Union, there are 28

Central Securities Depositories Regulation 
(CSDR)13, which largely came into force in Sep -
tember 2014, and supplementary legislation at 
the European level. Much like the EMIR, the 
CSDR transposes the principles for financial 
market infrastructures into a single European 
supervisory and oversight regime for CSDs. In 
some respects, particularly in the area of settle -
ment discipline, the CSDR even goes beyond 
the international requirements in terms of its 
content.
In a reflection of the single European authorisa -
tion process which already exists for central 
counterparties under the EMIR, the CSDR now 
also establishes a similar arrangement for CSDs, 
according  to which the CSD services defined in 
the CSDR are to be reviewed and evaluated in 
terms of risk. After the corresponding second -
ary legislation at the European level entered 
into force on 30 March 2017, CSDs had until 
30  September 2017 to submit requests for 
authorisation . In Germany, Clearstream Bank -
ing AG Frankfurt (CBF) submitted its authorisa -
tion request in good time to BaFin – the com -
petent national supervisory authority for secur -
ities. In formal terms, once BaFin has finished 
checking this request for completeness, it is to 
forward all the documents to the Bundesbank’s 
oversight function, which then has up to three 
months to issue its opinion. In practice, BaFin 
and the Bundesbank liaise closely on this task, 
which includes preparing and checking the 
completeness of authorisation requests and 
reviewing  their contents. Since CBF also has a 
banking licence, the Bundesbank is involved in 
this cooperative national supervisory and over -
sight regime in its function as a banking super -
visor as well.
As the euro ranks among the most important 
settlement currencies for the national CSDs 
located  in the euro area, the Eurosystem, in its 
CBI function, is also to be involved in the 
author isation processes for CBF alongside the 
Bundesbank. The Bundesbank will represent 
the Eurosystem as the CBI in dealings with CBF 
in much the same way as it does in matters of CCP supervision. Within the Eurosystem, how -
ever, the Bundesbank will be bound by the 
rules of the Eurosystem’s decision- making bod -
ies in this respect. The Eurosystem’s status as 
the CBI has ramifications beyond the authorisa -
tion process. Given that any monetary policy 
operations between banks and the Eurosystem 
have to be secured and the marketable assets 
either stored with or transferred to a CSD, the 
Eurosystem is an important user of the settle -
ment services provided by CSDs. To date, the 
Eurosystem has carried out independent re -
views and evaluations of the securities settle -
ment systems operated by CSDs from a user’s 
perspective. These will be discontinued in the 
foreseeable future as their content overlaps 
with the provisions of the CSDR to a large ex -
tent. It is envisaged that the insights into the 
risk situation gained through the Eurosystem’s 
CBI role will be used in future to assure the 
suitability of the CSDs concerned for the Euro -
system’s monetary policy operations.14
From a legal perspective, the TARGET2-Securities 
(T2S) platform15 operated by the Eurosystem is 
neither a CSD nor a securities settlement sys -
tem, which means that it does not fall within 
the immediate scope of the CSDR. As a tech -
nical platform for securities settlement in cen -

full implementation of a European capital mar -
kets union.16 The expert group’s report of 
15  May 2017 discusses the “Giovannini bar -
riers”17 in greater detail and provides an over -
view of lingering and newly identified barriers. 
Building on this report, the EPTF carried out a 
public consultation from 23  August until 
15 November 2017 to identify trends in post-  
trade services, dismantle market barriers and 
better manage existing risks. The ultimate ob -
jective of all of these efforts is to make the 
European post- trade landscape even more effi -
cient, more competition- oriented and, above 
all, safer. Another topic on the EPTF’s agenda is 
how new technologies (eg blockchain) and the 
services provided by innovative FinTech com -
panies impact on securities settlement.
Systemically important 
payment  systems
In July 2014, the ECB exercised its authority to 
issue regulations in the area of payment sys -
tems oversight18 for the first time. The Regula -
tion on the oversight requirements for system -
ically important payment systems (SIPS Regu-
lation)19 governs responsibilities, rights and 
obligations  in the oversight of systemically im -
portant payment systems. Like the CSDR, the 
SIPS Regulation goes beyond the international 
standards in terms of its requirements. For in -
stance, systemically important payment sys -
tems are expected to ensure that final settle -
ment takes place in central bank money at the 
end of the day.
Systemic importance is measured here using a 
combination of different criteria: the value of 
the payments settled, market penetration, the 
scope of cross- border activity, and use by other 
financial market infrastructures (see the chart 
on page 50). Once a year, the Eurosystem con -
ducts a review to determine which payment 
systems are considered systemically important 
within the meaning of the SIPS Regulation and nominates a competent oversight authority in 
the Euro system for each system meeting the 
criteria. This authority is responsible for moni -
toring the compliance of the payment system 
with the SIPS Regulation and has the right to 
obtain information from the system operator as 
well as to issue recommendations for corrective 
action if necessary. Should breaches of the 
Regulation be identified, the ECB has the power 
to impose sanctions on the system operator.
In August 2014, the Eurosystem classified four 
payment systems as systemically important (see 
the table on page 50): TARGET2, the payment 
system operated by the Eurosystem, and the 
commercial systems EURO1, STEP2-T and 
CORE(FR). The Banque de France was nomin -
ated as the competent authority for CORE(FR), 
while the ECB is responsible for the other sys -
tems. The Bundesbank assists the ECB with 
these oversight activities in the Eurosystem. The 
retail payment system operated by the Bundes -
bank, on the other hand, does not meet the 
above- mentioned criteria. It falls into the cat -
egory of other retail payment systems which 
only have to observe selected rules in certain 
areas.

17 The origins of this term can be traced back to the Gio -

Giovannini, which published reports between 2001 and 
2003 on cross-  border clearing and settlement arrange -

18 The oversight of payments and settlement systems is a 
central bank task aimed at promoting security and effi -
ciency. The central bank monitors existing and planned sys -
tems, reviews their security and efficiency, and ensures that 
changes are made where appropriate. For more informa -

tion20 which mainly comprise more stringent 
rules for credit and liquidity risk assessment, 
new cyber resilience requirements and new 
powers for competent oversight authorities. In 
future, overseers will be able to appoint an ex -
pert to perform an independent review of the 
system, which means that individual elements 
can be assessed in detail if, for example, the 
competent authority itself does not have the 
necessary expertise. The competent authority 
can also conduct on- site inspections.
The revision also reflects the Eurosystem’s focus 
on the increased threat posed by cyber risks in recent years, although it does not spell out 
how cyber resilience is to be achieved in detail. 
Having said that, the Committee on Payments 
and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the 
International Organization of Securities Com -
missions (IOSCO) already published their Guid-
ance on cyber resilience for financial market 
infrastructures21 back in June 2016. This docu -
ment outlines general objectives for strength -
ening cyber resilience, and leaves scope for the 
relevant financial market infrastructure to de -
termine how these objectives may be achieved 
individually. The key aspects of the guidance 
document are as follows.
– Cyber resilience should also receive due at -
tention from the FMI’s board and senior 
management.
– The ability to resume operations quickly and 
safely following a successful cyber attack 
should be top priority.
– Cyber resilience should be tested regularly 
and information on the threat environment 
analysed.Cyber resilienceCriteria for determining a payment system’s systemic importance

reflected in the company culture.
– Improvements in cyber resilience require the 
joint efforts of the industry as a whole.
The Eurosystem has since formulated specific 
oversight requirements for the guidance docu -
ment’s application in the euro area. These re -
quirements are currently open for public con -
sultation.22 They exist not only to assist over -
sight authorities in reviewing financial market 
infrastructures, but also to outline detailed 
steps for infrastructure operators to improve 
cyber resilience and to encourage the achieve -
ment of this objective through dialogue and 
close cooperation between operators and over -
sight authorities.
Payment services
In 2009, the Payment Services Directive (PSD) 
formed a harmonised legal framework for the 
settlement of payments in the EU. The revised 
version of this legislation (PSD223) is now ex -
pected to be a catalyst for major change in the 
payment services market.
In its revised form, the PSD2’s objectives are, 
on the one hand, to further deepen market in -
tegration within the European Union and help 
strengthen competition and consumer rights. 
On the other hand, new rules are expected to 
add to the security of retail payments, espe -
cially with regard to the use of innovative pay -
ment methods such as payments made using a 
mobile phone.
The PSD2 had to be transposed into national 
law by 13 January 2018. This was done in Ger -
many, inter alia,  through amendments to the 
Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch)  and the 
Payment Services Oversight Act (Zahlungs -
diensteaufsichtsgesetz)  via the Act implement -
ing the provisions of the Second Payment Ser -
vices Directive of 17 July 2017, which entered 
into force on 13 January 2018.One key amendment of the PSD2 is the add -
ition of payment initiation services (PIS) and 
account  information services (AIS) to the list of 
payment services. While providers of PIS initiate 
customers’ credit transfer orders from payment 
accounts held with their payment service pro -
vider (particularly where e- commerce purchases 
are paid for), providers of AIS make available to 
their customers consolidated information on 
one or more of their payment accounts held 
with other payment service providers (PSPs). 
With the introduction of the PSD2, the inter -
action between account servicing payment ser -
vice providers (ASPSPs) and these third- party 
providers, which have been in the market since 
the mid-2000s, is now governed by law.
The inclusion of an additional service provider 
in the PIS and AIS process chains between the 
customer and the ASPSP meant that the exist -
ing rules needed to be amended and new ones 
introduced. The resulting changes relate to 
both the specific rights and obligations which 
the new entrants have towards their custom -
ers, such as the handling of confidential cus -
tomer data, and also to the rules concerning 
their relationship with the ASPSPs, particularly 
with regard to identification requirements and 
secure communications. The existing transpar -
ency and disclosure requirements for PSPs, 
however, have been left largely unchanged.
Lastly, in addition to strengthening consumer 
rights, the PSD2 also contains a raft of new 
rules to increase the security in retail payments 
and improve the protection of customers’ 
financial  data. Perhaps the most important of 
these is the requirement for PSPs to use strong PSD2 …

customer authentication.24 Strong customer 
authentication has to be applied when a cus -
tomer (a) accesses their payment account on -
line, in other words via the internet or a mobile 
device, (b) initiates an electronic payment, or 
(c) carries out any action through a remote 
channel which may imply a risk of payment 
fraud or other abuse. For remote  electronic 
payments, strong customer authentication 
must also include elements that dynamically 
link the payment transaction to the respective 
payment amount and payee.
In key areas, the PSD2 contains only general 
provisions, which still need to be fleshed out. 
To this end, the PSD2 assigned the European 
Banking Authority (EBA), in cooperation with 
the ECB, three mandates to draw up regulatory 
technical standards (RTS) and guidelines.25
The debate surrounding the EBA’s RTS for 
strong customer authentication and secure 
communication has attracted particular atten -
tion. The EBA drew up these RTS in cooper -
ation with the ECB and several central banks 
from the European Economic Area, including 
the Deutsche Bundesbank. They were pub -
lished by the European Commission as a 
delegated  act on 13 March 2018 and provide 
further details –  ensuring  technology and 
business- model neutrality  – concerning the 
type of authentication that PSPs have to re -
quire from their customers as well as possible 
exemptions to the application of strong cus -
tomer authentication (see the adjacent box). 
Furthermore, they also include provisions on 
the protection of personalised security creden -
tials and on the design of common and secure 
standards for communication between the dif -Mandates for

– Access to account information without

– Transport fares and parking fees at un-

of personalised security credentials
– Ensure the confi  dentiality and integrity 
of authentication codes during all 
phases of the authentication
– Ensure the confi  dentiality and integrity 
of personalised security credentials 
throughout their lifecycle24 In accordance with Article 4 (30) PSD2 and section 1 
(24) of the Payment Services Oversight Act, strong cus -
tomer authentication requires at least two independent 
factors from two out of three categories: “knowledge” (= 
something only the user knows, such as a password), “pos -
session” (= something only the user possesses, such as a 
payment card) and inherence (= something that the user is, 
such as a fingerprint).

ferent PSPs as well as between PSPs and their 
customers.
The core of this second part of the standards is 
the obligation for ASPSPs to provide at least 
one interface to the customer account for pay -
ment initiation service providers (PISPs) and 
account  information service providers (AISPs). 
This access to payment accounts can take place 
through the customer’s existing online banking 
interface or via a new dedicated interface, 
known as an application programming inter -
face (API), and requires the third- party PSP to 
identify itself to the ASPSP . If the ASPSP opts to 
have a dedicated interface, this interface must 
offer the same level of availability and perform -
ance as access via the customer interface. Fur -
thermore, ASPSPs opting for an API have to 
provide a contingency fallback mechanism via 
which PISPs and AISPs can access the customer 
account, also after having identified themselves 
to the ASPSP . However, an ASPSP may, under 
certain conditions, be relieved of this obligation 
by its national supervisory authority. The RTS 
will enter into force 18 months after publica -
tion. For those payment accounts covered by 
the PSD2, this will also put an end to the cur -
rent practice of PISPs and AISPs accessing cus -
tomer accounts without prior identification.
In December 2017, the EBA adopted guidelines 
on security measures and control mechanisms 
to contain the operational and security risks of 
payment services. Taking into account the prin -
ciple of proportionality, the EBA and the ECB 
developed requirements, including some per -
taining to governance, risk assessment, protec -
tion of data and systems, business continuity 
and testing, in line with the existing EBA guide -
lines on the security of internet payments and 
with other standards and frameworks. The new 
rules have a wider scope than the existing EBA 
guidelines as they apply to all providers and 
payment services that are covered by the PSD2. 
They shall be implemented by the national 
supervisory authorities in their respective super -
visory practices.The guidelines on major incident reporting 
entered into force on 13 January 2018. They 
require  PSPs to report relevant incidents to their 
competent supervisory authority. In Germany, 
this is BaFin, which forwards the reports to the 
Bundesbank, the EBA and the ECB, and – if the 
incident is of relevance  – also notifies other 
national  authorities.
In addition to the PSD2 and its downstream 
acts, other European rules and projects have a 
significant influence on the provision of pay -
ment services. They include, for example, the 
Fourth Money Laundering Directive and the 
new Regulation on information accompanying 
transfers of funds, which, in line with current 
international standards and recommendations, 
modernise the legal framework to combat 
money laundering and terrorist financing.26
This results, inter alia,  in changes in customer 
identification, such as when consumers open a 
payment account electronically. For instance, 
under the German legislation transposing the 
Fourth EU  Money Laundering Directive on 
authen tication of online services, electronic 
identification means as defined in the Regula -
tion on electronic identification and trust ser -
vices for electronic transactions27 are also 
accepted  under certain conditions. This can be, 
for example, an electronic identity card or a 
chip card containing data that is used to iden -
tify a person. The German transposition also

requirements for the use of such procedures 
for institutions operating in Germany. These 
developments can help fully digital business 
processes become more firmly established and 
thus capitalise to an even greater extent on the 
potential offered by digitalisation.
Lastly, in March 2017, the European Commis -
sion published the “Consumer Financial Ser -
vices Action Plan: Better Products, More 
Choice”. Concrete action followed on 28 March 
2018 in the shape of a Commission proposal 
stating that, in the future, charges on cross-  
border payments in euro should be set at the 
level of domestic payments for the EU as a 
whole. To date, this regulation has only applied 
to euro area countries. The proposal also aims 
at increasing transparency for payments involv -
ing a currency conversion, thus boosting com -
petition.28
Conclusion
Resilient financial market infrastructures are of 
paramount importance for both the financial 
system and the real economy, given their cen -
tral role in settling financial transactions. Dis -
ruptions to these critical components can have 
significant implications for the participating 
banks, for financial markets and for the per -
formance of tasks by the Eurosystem. One rea -
son for this is that central banks rely heavily on 
the services of CSDs to receive collateral for 
monetary policy loans to counterparties or to 
hold securities under the current purchase pro -
grammes. In addition to effective supervision 
and oversight, the provision of settlement ser -
vices in highly liquid and highly secure central 
bank money is also crucial to reducing risks and 
safeguarding financial stability.
In view of the heightened threat situation, 
strengthening the cyber resilience of financial 
market infrastructures has a particularly high 
priority for supervisory and overseeing author -
ities. In this context, it is essential to give due consideration to the fact that while advancing 
digitalisation means efficiency gains, it also 
opens up new points for attack and changes 
the risk situation for market infrastructure oper -
ators. Responsibility for taking action to raise 
the level of protection lies primarily with the 
system operators and market participants 
themselves. But it is not simply a matter of im -
plementing suitable technical devices – risk 
awareness has to become part of the corporate 
culture. Given the rapid pace of change, super -
visors are applying a new approach; rather 
than monitoring whether specific provisions 
have been fulfilled, they instead analyse the 
degree  of maturity of the defensive measures 
in place and steps being taken to improve 
them. In addition, the Eurosystem has made a 
valuable contribution by setting up the Euro -
pean Cyber Resilience Board (ECRB). The aim of 
this board is to promote dialogue on cyber 
resilience  among European financial market in -
frastructures, central banks and other regula -
tors.
Other key points to be addressed concern 
CCPs. Central clearing has experienced a verit -
able boom in recent years. As a result, efforts 
should be stepped up to complete the work on 
the European recovery and resolution regime 
for CCPs in the near future. The aim must be to 
establish a credible regime that ensures finan -
cial stability and, in the event of a serious oc -
currence, manages as far as possible without 
having to resort to using public funds. For the 
Bundesbank, it is essential that the future 
supervisory regime for non- EU CCPs is based 
on functioning super vision by the authorities of 
the EU member states in compliance with regu -
lations valid across the EU. Accordingly, when 
assessing concrete policy options, precedence 
must be given to ensuring that payment trans -
actions and the settlement of securities and de -
rivatives transactions are secure, with cost con -
siderations taking second place. In any event, “Consumer

due to the multiple interactions with its tasks, 
the Eurosystem should be appropriately in -
volved in supervision.
The PSD2 substantially amends the rules 
governing  EU payment transactions. Well-  
established structures in the market for pay -
ment services are likely to be broken down as a 
result, in particular, of the possibility for third 
parties to offer customers innovative services 
on the basis of access to their accounts (known 
as “open banking”). The Bundesbank is of the 
opinion that the rules outlined in the PSD2 as 
well as the related RTS provide a good basis for 
the further digitalisation of payment transac -
tions, in particular by increasing competition 
and ensuring that security levels are high. Con -
sistent implementation of the PSD2 and appli -
cation of the RTS across all member states are essential in order to stimulate competition 
throughout the EU and overcome fragmenta -
tion in national markets. In addition, care must 
be taken to ensure that the provision of dedi -
cated interfaces (APIs), which both third-  party 
PSPs and other credit institutions can access, in 
the banking industry is sufficiently standard -
ised. Only then will it be possible for new and 
attractive products for consumers to grow and 
thrive in the Single Euro Payments Area. At this 
stage, it is difficult to say whether these new 
products will be brought to the market more 
by traditional credit institutions, start-  ups or 
existing internet platforms. However, the lead -
ing credit institutions appear to have recog -
nised that the PSD2 does indeed offer scope to 
increase the service level of the payment ac -
count they offer their own customers, and to 
thus enhance their own attractiveness.Deutsche Bundesbank

Maastricht debt: methodological principles, 
compilation and development in Germany
The Maastricht Treaty established the government deficit and (gross) government debt as corner -
stones of the European fiscal rules. The respective ceilings defined in the Treaty are 3% and 60% 
of gross domestic product (GDP). In Germany, the Federal Statistical Office compiles the deficit 
data as defined by the Maastricht Treaty, while the Bundesbank compiles the Maastricht debt 
data.
Maastricht debt encompasses loans, debt securities issued and deposits received as well as liabil -
ities arising from coins in circulation. To make the figures comparable across Europe, the Euro -
pean System of Accounts (ESA) is used as a common statistical basis for the compilation. The 
required data come from very different accounting systems in Germany, because not just core 
budgets but also off- budget entities have to be included. Moreover, local government accounting 
is governed by rules specific to the relevant state government, which sometimes grant the option 
of choosing between double- entry and single- entry bookkeeping. Furthermore, to compile the 
Maastricht debt data, additions and adjustments have to be performed against the original data 
stemming from the national debt statistics and use made of several other data sources, special 
surveys and model calculations.
In recent years, agreements have been reached at the European level imposing much higher 
requirements on the scope and quality of the statistics that have to be reported, and the supervi -
sion by Eurostat has been extended. This presents mounting challenges for Germany, too. Against 
this backdrop, it would make sense to aim for a more harmonised accounting system across 
general government that depicts income and expenditure flows with balance sheet stocks in an 
integrated way. At the very least, however, the existing accounting systems need to be adapted 
such that European and international data needs can be met.
Figures for Germany’s Maastricht debt are available from 1991. The debt ratio rose from 39% to 
81% in 2010, driven particularly by burdens connected with German reunification and by the 
financial and economic crisis. Other factors that played a role were the propping up of the finan -
cial markets, when state- owned “bad banks” took on bank portfolios, and later also the assis -
tance loans granted to other euro area member states. Over the past few years, the debt ratio 
has been scaled back significantly thanks to very favourable macroeconomic developments and

The Maastricht criteria: 
cornerstones  of the 
European  fiscal rules
Sound public finances are a key foundation for 
a stability- oriented monetary union. The EU 
member states therefore set out fiscal rules in 
the Maastricht Treaty and subsequently aug -
mented them with the Stability and Growth 
Pact. The Maastricht Treaty specifies reference 
values: 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) for 
the government deficit and 60% of GDP for 
government debt (the Maastricht criteria). As a 
rule, these should not be exceeded.1 The refer -
ence values (and extensive additional data) 
have to be compiled by member states using 
common Europe- wide rules and reported to 
Eurostat, Europe’s statistical office, twice a 
year. Eurostat reviews the figures, expresses 
any reservations it may have, and can request 
adjustments or make them itself. As a particular 
consequence of Greece’s serious misreporting 
of data, the statistical reporting requirements 
and checks were intensified considerably. 
Moreover, specific requirements were placed 
on the government accounting systems under -
pinning the statistics, and the option of impos -
ing sanctions for attempted fraud and serious 
negligence in reporting was introduced. The 
European Council can impose sanctions on the 
recommendation of the European Commis -
sion.2 Finally, the debt criterion was given a 
greater emphasis in the fiscal framework (Sta -
bility and Growth Pact) and was fleshed out.
In Germany, the Bundesbank is responsible for 
compiling the Maastricht debt data and the 
Federal Statistical Office for compiling the 
Maastricht deficit data as well as for the rele -
vant definition of the government sector. This 
article describes the methodological principles 
as well as the precise compilation of Maastricht 
debt by the Bundesbank and explains the 
differ  ences compared to the results of the 
national  debt statistics. In addition, it explains 
the Maastricht debt data, which are available 
from 1991.Methodological principles
The Maastricht debt data is compiled based on 
the European System of Accounts (ESA). These 
rules largely follow the standards of the global 
System of National Accounts (SNA),3 which is 
revised and updated with the collaboration of 
international organisations and national statis -
tics agencies. The current version of the Euro -
pean framework (ESA 2010),4 which was drawn 
up by Eurostat and the national statistical of -
fices to primarily reflect European needs, sets 
out how economic activities in the EU are to be 
statistically recorded in the national accounts. 
Questions of interpretation relating to the com -
pilation of the Maastricht reference values are 
also answered by a comprehensive and regu -
larly updated manual (MGDD).5 Additional 
binding rules are found in Eurostat’s guidelines, 
clarifications and technical compilation guides 
for specific cases. Each member state releases 
an extensive inventory of the methods, proced -
ures and sources used to explain exactly how 
the European requirements are implemented 
on the basis of the national data resources 
available to them.6 Given the vast number of 
detailed rules and specificities surrounding im -
plementation, this article focuses on the most 
substantial factors and interrelationships.Sound public

Definition of the government 
sector
According to the ESA, the general government 
sector comprises units that primarily engage in 
non- market production and that are financed 
mostly by compulsory levies, as well as those 
that principally redistribute income and wealth. 
In Germany, a distinction is made between the 
subsectors of central, state and local govern -
ment (including its associations, such as district 
authorities) and the social security funds, which 
in turn are divided into core budgets and off-  
budget entities. The off- budget entities include 
all funds, agencies and undertakings that are 
spun off from the core budgets or newly estab -
lished and which largely perform government 
functions, regardless of their legal form.7
It is often difficult to make an economic distinc -
tion between government and corporate activ -
ity. Besides the government’s core budgets, 
there are a multitude of entities that are organ -
ised as businesses and are influenced and 
financed  by government to varying degrees. 
According to the ESA, entities such as these 
only belong to the government sector if gov -
ernment has direct or indirect control over the 
set- up of their core business and they engage 
principally in non- market production.8 The 
latter  is mostly defined in terms of the entity 
not covering more than half of its production 
costs (including interest and depreciation of 
fixed assets) by market sales.9 If market activity 
predominates, the entity is not assigned to the 
government sector. Hence, general govern -
ment can in fact be the majority owner of 
entities  engaged in corporate activity which do 
not belong to the government sector because 
they lack key characteristics of government 
activity  .10 Maastricht debt captures liabilities of 
the general government sector as thus de -
fined.11Definition of Maastricht debt
Maastricht debt comprises the consolidated 
gross debt of general government. “Gross” 
means that no government assets are offset 
when calculating the debt level. “Consolidated” 
means that government liabilities to other gov -
ernment entities are eliminated. The Maastricht 
debt level thus represents the government’s 
debt to other domestic sectors and foreign 
creditors.
Maastricht debt does not include all financial 
liabilities of a government. Of the eight cat -
egories of financial assets (ESA code: AF12) be-
tween which the ESA distinguishes, only three 
make up Maastricht debt (the liability items Government

budgets and

7 Off- budget entities can also be formed by acquiring 
participating  interests, provided the acquired entity mainly 
performs government activities. The current list of off-  
budget entities is published by the Federal Statistical Office,

8 The public sector is defined more broadly than the gov -
ernment sector, and also contains entities majority- owned 
by government that are predominantly engaged in market 
production. It includes, for instance, promotional and de -
velopment banks, savings banks and Landesbanken, but 
often also entities such as public utilities and waste man -
agement operations.
9 This criterion applies to non- financial corporations. In the 
case of financial corporations (such as banks), the crucial 
factor is whether they act as a financial intermediary and 
are themselves exposed to the risks posed by their business 
or whether these risks lie with the government instead.
10 A more detailed account can be found in P Schmidt et 
al, Die Abgrenzung des Staatssektors in den Volkswirt -
schaftlichen Gesamtrechnungen, Wirtschaft und Statistik , 
1/ 2017, pp 35ff.
11 A debt indicator based on the public sector would also 
contain the liabilities of all enterprises majority- owned by 
government. However, this would mean the inclusion of 
market producers whose liabilities are not under the con -
trol of policymakers. Notwithstanding this, the ESA allows 
for individual activities of non- government entities to be 
rerouted through government for statistical purposes, pro -
vided the tasks can be clearly demarcated as government 
activities within an entity assigned to another sector. A typ -
ical example of this would be the specifically assigned busi -
ness activities (“Zuweisungsgeschäfte”) of the Reconstruc -
tion Loan Corporation (Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau), the 
German Federal development bank which is not part of the 
government sector. These are conducted on behalf of cen -
tral government, with the Federal budget assuming the re -
spective costs and risks.

is used for both asset and liability items.Deutsche Bundesbank

AF.2, AF.3 and AF.4).13 This restriction exists in 
part because not all government liabilities are 
considered relevant in the context of EU 
budgetary surveillance, and partly also because 
of practical measurement aspects and prob -
lems with data availability. Specifically, the ESA 
distinguishes between the following items.
– “Monetary gold and special drawing rights 
(AF.1)” are normally recorded in central bank 
balance sheets only. Central banks do not 
belong to the general government sector 
according to the ESA.
– “Currency and deposits (AF.2)” form part of 
Maastricht debt. They include, for example, 
deposits of third parties held in custody ac -
counts with the central government and 
liabilities  arising from coins in circulation, 
which are attributed to central government 
as the issuer of German euro coins. By con -
trast, banknotes are solely a central bank 
liability  .
– “Debt securities (AF.3)” form part of Maas -
tricht debt. A distinction is made between 
“short- term debt securities (AF.31)” (money 
market paper) with an original maturity of 
no more than one year and “long- term debt 
securities (AF.32)” (capital market paper) 
with an original maturity of more than one 
year. These include, for example, bonds is -
sued by central government or securitised 
liabilities of winding- up agencies (“bad 
banks”) within the government sector.
– “Loans (AF.4)” form part of Maastricht debt. 
These also include, for example, bank loans 
granted to local government enterprises, 
which, as non- market producers, count as 
off- budget entities in the government sec -
tor. Like debt securities, loans are differenti -
ated by their original maturity and split into 
“short- term loans (AF.41)” and “long- term 
loans (AF.42)”. Government cash advances 
are classified as short- term loans, even 
though in some cases at the local govern -
ment level they are evidently arranged with longer maturities. Furthermore, cash collat -
eral received as part of derivatives transac -
tions also counts toward loan liabilities.
– “Equity and investment fund shares or units 
(AF.5)” are equity instruments and therefore 
do not form part of Maastricht debt.
– Claims against “insurance, pension and 
standardised guarantee schemes (AF.6)” do 
not form part of Maastricht debt. They com -
prise prospective liabilities already accrued 
but not yet due, the size of which is some -
times still undetermined, arising from funded 
government pension schemes and from 
standardised guarantee schemes. Neither 
play a role in Germany at the moment, as 
the items of particular relevance in Germany 
– claims on unfunded pension schemes of 
government employers (pensions) and on 
the statutory pension insurance scheme  – 
are not recorded under AF.6.14 They do not 
fall under any other ESA instrument category 
either; instead, they are simply recorded as 
memo items.15
– “Financial derivatives and employee stock 
options (AF.7)” do not form part of Maas -
tricht debt. They include, for example, inter -
est rate swaps which are used for debt man -
agement, particularly to manage interest 
rate fixation periods and any currency risk. 
13 Nonetheless, according to Council Regulation (EC) 
No 479/ 2009 and Regulation (EU) No 549/ 2013 all cat -
egories named in the ESA, particularly trade payables, are 
required.
14 Civil servant pension entitlements, for which a capital 
stock is built up in funds or reserves, are not recorded in 
AF.6 either, since the system as a whole is not considered 
to be a funded scheme. The Federal Statistical Office has 
performed extensive calculations of the claims of house -
holds on pension schemes. Preliminary results can be found 
in T  Haug, Berechnung der Pensions- und Rentenan -
wartschaften in den Volkswirtschaftlichen Gesamtrechnun -
gen, Wirtschaft und Statistik, 2/ 2018, pp 77 ff.
15 In view of demographic change, in particular, it is im -
portant that these government burdens are also taken into 
account when analysing fiscal sustainability. However, the 
reported size of the liabilities is heavily dependent on as -
sumptions about discount factors, for example, and long- 
term developments in demographics and the labour mar -
ket. Furthermore, future burdens on government budgets 
are influenced by legislative changes (such as an increase in 
the retirement age).Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
April 2018

However, derivatives can also be designed 
such that the government counterparty ini -
tially receives additional compensation 
which it rebalances over the life of the in -
strument. The derivative thus entails a de 
facto  loan relationship. To take this situation 
into account, loan components such as this 
are now eliminated from the derivatives and 
added to the loan portion of Maastricht 
debt (AF.4).
– “Other accounts receivable/ payable (AF.8)” 
are “trade credits and advances” and “other 
accounts receivable/ payable, excluding trade 
credits and advances”, and do not form part 
of Maastricht debt. The former are created 
by the time lag between the performance of 
an agreed transaction and the correspond -
ing payment. The latter arise due to timing 
differences between distributive transactions 
(eg in the case of court rulings on tax re -
funds) or financial transactions in the sec -
ondary market and the actual payment. As a 
general rule, AF.8 should only contain short- 
term, largely unavoidable items of a small 
size.16 For these reasons, and owing to poor 
data availability, this item was not included 
in the Maastricht definition of debt. How -
ever, the financial and sovereign debt crisis 
revealed that unpaid invoices, for example, 
can become a very relevant substitute for 
normal financing in the capital market.17 
Since 2012, trade credits incurred by govern -
ment have therefore been considered rele -
vant to the loan portion (AF.4) of Maastricht 
debt in two specific cases: when key terms 
of the contract are renegotiated and when 
the creditor transfers its claim to a third 
party without recourse.18 Neither of these 
applications has so far played a role in Ger -
many, however. Germany has a basic prob -
lem capturing other accounts receivable / 
payable (AF.8) because the single- entry 
bookkeeping method is still very widespread 
among government entities.
Contingent liabilities, such as guarantees and 
sureties as well as provisions, are not liabilities as recorded in the ESA accounts and therefore 
are not a component of Maastricht debt.19 
However, the ESA does permit exceptions to 
this rule. For example, new government guar -
antees on liabilities of non- government entities, 
where it is deemed very probable that they will 
be called, are recorded as though they had 
already  been called.20 A guaranteed liability of 
this kind is therefore counted towards Maas -
tricht debt.21
Valuation of the debt 
components 
Aside from the question of which categories 
have to be included in Maastricht debt, the 
issue of how each of them are valued also has 
to be clarified. The ESA stipulates that currency 
and deposits as well as loans are recorded at 
their nominal value22 and securities at market 
value. Because the ESA is a national system of 
accounts, in which the creditors’ claims must 
match the debtors’ liabilities, these valuations Contingent

16 According to ESA 10 (20.132), government financing 
presented as long- term trade credits is classified as loans 
(AF.4). The MGDD (VIII.2.1 (3)) specifies long- term as mean -
ing an original maturity of more than one year.
17 In Italy, for example, unpaid government invoices 
amounted to 4% of GDP between 2010 and 2012. See

19 However, information about government contingent 
liabilities  has to be provided on the basis of Council Direct -
ive 2011/ 85/ EU (EU  Budgetary Frameworks Directive), 
amongst other legislation.
20 A corresponding expense is recorded in the Maastricht 
deficit. In the government budgets, authorisations for ex -
penditure and future commitments have to be given for 
such guarantees.
21 The other case of contingent liabilities having to be re -
corded pursuant to the ESA relates to standardised guaran -
tees (such as those for export financing) for which the 
available data allow for a reliable estimation of the prob -
able number of calls under the guarantee, such that the 
insurance technical reserves can be recorded properly. 
However, these guarantees are recorded in AF.6 and there -
fore do not form part of Maastricht debt.

are applicable for both assets and liabilities . 
Debt as defined by the Maastricht Treaty 
departs  from this, however, in that the three 
liability  items included (AF.2 to AF.4) are recog -
nised at face value.23
The face value of a government debt is equal 
to its principal, which is the originally agreed 
repayment amount less any repayments al -
ready made (redemptions). In the case of in -
dexed liabilities (eg inflation- linked bonds), the 
face value also encompasses the change in the 
repayment amount caused by past index move -
ments. Interest payments on the principal are 
only included in the face value if they were ex -
plicitly credited.24 In the case of securities, the 
issue price often differs from the face value on 
account of pricing in the auction process.25 Pre-
miums or discounts on the issue are spread 
over the residual maturity of the security and 
recorded in the fiscal balance as interest costs/ 
savings in addition to the coupons.26 As the 
face value is not marked to market, it is un -
affected by market forces. Debt instruments 
issued  in foreign currency are one exception. 
These are converted at the relevant exchange 
rate on the reporting date and change the level 
of Maastricht debt accordingly, in the absence 
of any compensatory exchange rate hedging 
transactions, such as currency swaps (other -
wise, the hedged rate should be recognised).
Compilation of Germany’s 
Maastricht debt
As part of European fiscal surveillance, Maas -
tricht debt is to be reported to the European 
Commission (Eurostat). To do this, current val -
ues for the four previous year- end levels are 
reported  twice each year – in the spring notifi -
cation at the end of March and the autumn 
notification at the end of September.27 Further -
more, there are obligations at the European 
level to provide quarterly Maastricht debt four 
times per year.28The annual debt statistics29 and annual finan -
cial asset stock statistics30 form the essential 
framework for the data to be reported. These 
official statistics are captured by the Federal 
Statistical Office in cooperation with the state 
statistical offices on the basis of the German 
Law on the Statistics of Public Finance and Pub -
lic Service Personnel (Gesetz über die Statistiken

23 See Article 1 (5) sentence 3 of Council Regulation (EC) 
No  479/ 2009. These different valuation methods from 
those in the ESA are the reason why debt as defined by the 
Maastricht Treaty does not equal the sum of the three 
liability  items recorded in the national accounts (financial 
accounts).
24 For accrued interest bonds, such as Type B Federal sav -
ings notes, where all interest claims are added to the prin -
cipal over the fixed lifetime of the instrument, the face 
value is equal only to the principal agreed upon issue.
25 In principle, premiums and discounts are also possible 
for loans.
26 Premiums or discounts occur when a security’s coupon 
differs from the market interest rate prevailing at the time 
of issuance. This is often the case for tap issues, in particu -
lar. However, the issuer is also able to charge premiums for 
the initial issue by offering coupons higher than the market 
interest rate. This equals a de facto higher liability, which is 
not reflected in Maastricht debt. Subsequently, there is also 
certain room for manoeuvre over time owing to the option 
of choosing between a new issue at market rates or a tap 
issuance of a previous issue with higher coupons. In add -
ition, securities without a coupon also have premiums 
when effective interest rates are negative. See Deutsche 
Bundesbank, The development of government interest ex -
penditure in Germany and other euro area countries, 
Monthly Report, July 2017, pp 33-68.
27 Within the context of the notification, Eurostat reviews 
the data and comprehensive questionnaires are to be com -
pleted. To the same end, Eurostat also conducts what are 
known as “dialogue visits” in EU member states at two-  
year intervals. During these visits, methodological problems 
in particular are discussed with the relevant statistical au -
thorities. Eurostat subsequently draws up what are known 
as “action points” to resolve any outstanding issues. Sum -
maries of mission findings and lists of action points are 
published on the Eurostat website: http:// ec.europa.eu/

öffentlichen Dienst) .31 The European statistical 
requirements have not been fully transposed 
into accounting practices and cash- related 
public finance statistics in Germany. For this 
reason, Maastricht debt is compiled using add -
itional sources.
First, liabilities that are not included in the debt 
statistics but are to be factored into govern -
ment debt in accordance with ESA are to be 
captured. Second, the national debt statistics 
only provide part of the data necessary for con -
solidating intra-  governmental debt relation -
ships. Third, financial assets and liabilities in the 
balance sheet context are required in particular 
for state- owned “bad banks” due to their sig -
nificant financial assets. These informational 
require ments are, where possible, covered by 
additional statistics on creditors (counterpar -
ties), special statistical surveys, as well as vari -
ous individual sources. In individual cases, esti -
mates are made to fill gaps in the data.
A schematic illustration of how Maastricht debt 
is compiled is shown in the table on page 70. 
Based on the debt of core budget and off-  
budget entities owed to the non- public sec -
tor32 according to the national debt statistics, 
mainly the additions33 described above are de -
picted. This reconciliation between the national 
debt statistics and Maastricht debt is explained 
in more detail below.
Adjustments due to differing 
methodologies and delinea -
tions as well as missing data
In order to compile Maastricht debt, additions 
with regard to official cash- related finance stat -
istics are necessary, as ESA allocates additional 
liabilities to general government in order to 
better depict economic reality.34 Currently, the 
most significant additional position is liabilities 
from lending via the European Financial Stabil -
ity Facility (EFSF) to euro area members during 
the sovereign debt crisis. Furthermore, certain 
liabilities of the Reconstruction Loan Corpor -ation (Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau, KfW) 
that are based on transactions directly attribut -
able to central government are also added to 
the government accounts. In this vein, KfW 
was instructed to issue loans to Greece, to take 
on shares in Deutsche Post and Deutsche Tele -
kom from central government as part of their 
privatisations (known as specific holding ar -
rangements), and to acquire EADS shares. The 
risk and net income of these operations is 
borne by central government. Such transac -
tions that are to be rerouted to the govern -
ment sector also occur at a number of state 
promotional banks, albeit at a considerably 
lower volume than the KfW transactions.35
As of 2000, issuance of student loans under 
the Federal Act on the Promotion of Education 
(Bundesausbildungsförderungsgesetz)  is no 
longer captured in the Federal budget.36 Up to 
and including the 2012 reporting year, the … in order to

Financial Market Stabilisation Fund (FMS), whose debt is 
managed by the Federal Republic of Germany – Finance 
Agency GmbH (Finance Agency), consistent evaluations 
from the Finance Agency, which are available earlier, are 
used for the debt statistics.
32 See Federal Statistical Office, Fachserie 14, Reihe 5, 
Tabellenblatt  2.1. Also included under “Debt in the non-  
public sector” are debts to public credit institutions, such as 
savings banks or promotional banks, as well as government 
securities- based debt in its entirety, as the parties subject to 
reporting requirements do not know whether the holders 
are governmental or non- governmental creditors. Credit-  
equivalent legal transactions that are also accounted for in 
the debt statistics, such as financial leasing, are to be 
added. Since these are not captured in the (preliminary) 
quarterly debt statistics, the values from the previous year 
as used for the current reporting year in the spring notifica -
tion.
33 Alongside those described below, other, less significant 
additions and adjustments – which are not explained in 
greater detail here – are necessary. An in- depth description 
of the methodology is available online : http:// ec.europa.
eu/ eurostat/ web/ government- finance- statistics/ excessive- 
deficit- procedure/ edp- inventories
34 See also footnote 11 on p 59.
35 Since 2016, rerouting transactions have been captured 
by the Federal Statistical Office via a special survey among 
promotional banks. The liabilities arising from these trans -
actions are factored into Maastricht debt, by assumption, 
as long- term loans.
36 The Federal budget only shows grants on interest relief 
provided to KfW and refunds for loan defaults, but not the 
issued loans and the associated incurrence of liabilities by 
central government, which would in fact be more appro -
priate. By contrast, these are captured in central govern -
ment’s wealth accounts, although not explicitly.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
April 2018  
63

financing  provided to central government by 
KfW in this context is to be added separately to 
Maastricht debt. Since 2013, these transactions 
have been factored into the official debt statis -
tics and are included in Maastricht debt in that 
way.37
A major liability that is not captured in the debt 
statistics, and therefore must be added, is euro 
coins in circulation as legal tender. Legally, Ger -
man euro coins are issued by the German Fed -
eral Government (and not by the Eurosystem, 
though the European Central Bank is required 
to approve the volume). Thus, central govern -
ment is partly financed through the issuance of 
coins, which – as is the case with Federal secur -
ities – represent a claim against it.38 The coin- 
related liability is captured in Maastricht debt as 
“currency and deposits”.
Also included in the “currency and deposits” 
category are liabilities arising from funds or 
similar third- party claims that are fundamen -
tally retrievable and recorded on purely ledger- 
based accounts of central government, known 
as suspense and advance payment accounts.39 
For example, central government credits the 
German share of EU own resources to a sus -
pense account for accounting purposes until 
the EU draws on the funds via a money order. 
At times, the EU also transfers funds back. This 
leads to a recording entry on the suspense 
account , which then functions as a kind of 
money market account for the EU at the Ger -
man Federal Government and therefore is to be 
factored into Maastricht debt. With the excep -
tion of the account for cash collateral received 
from derivative transactions, suspense and ad -
vance payment accounts are not captured in 
the debt statistics. Since these accounts are not 
generally factored into public budget account -
ing, they must be added via separate reports as 
and when necessary. As a result of non-  
integrated accounting, not all assets and liabil -
ities can be obtained in a consistent balance 
sheet context from a central accounting sys -
tem, which would be desirable.40Debts from public- private partnerships (PPPs) 
are to be recorded in the Maastricht debt if the 
risks are largely borne by general government.

37 In order to identify potential similar cases, a systematic 
inquiry was carried out amongst other government sectors 
as well. Through the inquiry, needs for corrections were 
identified in some Federal states, which, on the one hand, 
concerned cash collateral received from financial derivative 
transactions that are to be captured as short- term loan 
liabilities , and, on the other hand – albeit to a more limited 
extent – liabilities arising from advance financing of student 
grants and loans by KfW. As of the 2013 reporting year, 
these positions are now added to Maastricht debt on the 
basis of individual data reports. This is an example of the 
difficulties that can arise particularly from non- integrated 
public accounting systems, which do not fully guarantee 
adherence to the principle of gross recording and do not 
ensure a relationship between assets and liabilities.
38 The Bundesbank is responsible for issuance and with -
drawal, and, at the same time, is creditor vis- à- vis central 
government as well as debtor vis-  à- vis holders of euro 
coins in the national accounts. Central government is 
credited the nominal value of each euro coin brought into 
circulation (increase in coins in circulation) and debited 
the  nominal value of coins withdrawn from circulation 
(decrease  in coins in circulation) by the Bundesbank. In 
addition, the Bundesbank credits its coin holdings to cen -
tral government up to an amount of 10% of coins in circu -
lation (Article 6 of EU Council Regulation (EC) No 3603/ 93). 
With regard to return flows or recirculation of euro coins, 
no distinction is made between German euro coins and 
those from other member states. Collectors’ coins issued 
by central government, which are not usually used for pay -
ments, are not recorded in the euro coins in circulation as 
per ESA.
39 These are generally suspense accounts. However, custo -
dies on central government advance payment accounts 
also occur, for example for cash collateral received from 
derivatives transactions. Counter- entries on suspense ac -
counts are made for payments received from third parties if 
these are not to be allocated, or are not yet allocated, to a 
budgetary item. They are not relevant for Maastricht debt 
if, for example, they constitute other accounts payable 
(AF.8) under ESA, which are not included within the scope 
of Maastricht debt. The same is true if a budgetary expense 
is recorded as a liability on a suspense account, as long as 
payment has not yet been made. No central systematic 
overviews are available for the suspense and advance pay -
ment accounts. Instead, recording for Maastricht debt is 
based on a compilation of accounts which are operated 
decentrally by the individual account managers.
40 In its audit of the national debt statistics, the Federal 
Court of Auditors (Bundesrechnungshof, or BRH) has criti -
cised the inconsistent treatment of suspense and advance 
payment accounts (see BRH, Prüfungsmitteilung – Statistik 
der Schulden der öffentlichen Haushalte of 10 December 
2015).Deutsche Bundesbank

On the differences between defi  cit and change in debt 
(defi  cit-debt adjustments)
In principle, a close relationship exists be-
tween the Maastricht fi  scal balance1 (the 
government defi  cit or surplus) and the 
change in Maastricht debt. Defi  cits are usu-
ally fi  nanced by additional debt and sur-
pluses are used to repay debt. Nevertheless, 
the change in debt often deviates from the 
fi  scal balance. This difference is referred 
to  as a “defi  cit- debt adjustment” (DDA).2 
Although most of the DDA can be ex-
plained, statistical discrepancies remain 
which point to inconsistencies in the under-
lying data.
General government fi  scal balance: 
reﬂ  ected  in both the government non- 
fi  nancial accounts and the government 
fi  nancial accounts
In the context of the national accounts 
(NA), double- entry bookkeeping is carried 
out – as is customary in businesses – which 
means that each transaction is booked 
twice in one statistical unit. Most of the 
government transactions relate to both the 
government non- fi  nancial accounts and the 
government fi  nancial accounts.
Government revenue and expenditure are 
recorded in the government non- fi  nancial 
accounts as resources (eg tax revenue) or as 
uses (eg personnel expenditure).3 Financial 
transactions, ie transactions involving fi  nan-
cial assets or liabilities, are recorded in the 
government fi  nancial accounts. These often 
stand in relation to the revenue and ex-
penditure in the government non- fi  nancial 
accounts. For example, the tax revenue re-
corded in the non- fi  nancial accounts may 
be associated with higher fi  nancial assets 
(eg an increase in government bank de-
posits) in the fi  nancial accounts, whereas 
personnel expenditure is associated with payments by government, which reduce 
the (net) fi  nancial assets. The fi  scal balance 
is refl  ected both in the difference between 
revenue and expenditure in the non- 
fi  nancial accounts and in the balance of 
fi  nancial  transactions in the fi  nancial ac-
counts.4 Shifts within net fi  nancial assets 
(purely fi  nancial transactions) are refl  ected 
only in the fi  nancial accounts, where they 
offset each other; they therefore have no 
impact on the amount of the fi  scal balance. 
For instance, the purchase of shares in the 
market using bank deposits merely consti-
tutes a change in the composition of fi  nan-
cial assets, and the repayment of a loan by 
reducing bank deposits is likewise a balance 
sheet reduction that does not affect the fi  s-
cal balance.
Explained defi  cit- debt adjustments
Depending on how a defi  cit is fi  nanced or a 
surplus is used, or in the event of shifts 
within the composition of net fi  nancial 
assets, the change in Maastricht debt may 
deviate from the fi  scal balance (DDA). For 
example, if a surplus leads to an increase in 
bank deposits, fi  nancial assets rise while 
gross debt, against which assets are not 
netted, remains unchanged. In this case, 
1 Also referred to as “net lending/net borrowing”.
2 The difference is sometimes also referred to as a 
“stock- fl  ow adjustment”.
3 Revenue and expenditure do not include the sale or 
purchase of fi  nancial assets, which are purely fi  nancial 
transactions and so merely constitute shifts within the 
fi  nancial accounts. The amount of, and the time of re-
cording of transactions in the non- fi  nancial accounts 
are not necessarily in line with the corresponding cash 
fl  ow. Instead, it is often enough for a claim or a liability 
to arise for a transaction to be recorded in the report-
ing period.
4 Thus, the fi  scal balance corresponds to the transaction- 
based change in net stocks of fi  nancial assets. More-
over, net fi  nancial assets may change for reasons that 
are not transaction- based, for instance as a result of 
revaluations (eg an increase in share values).Deutsche Bundesbank

the defi  cit and the changes in debt do not 
develop synchronously (positive DDA).5 
Moreover, a defi  cit may be fi  nanced using 
fi  nancial liabilities, which are not included in 
Maastricht debt. For example, if short pay-
ment terms are used for purchases of goods 
and services, liabilities in the form of trade 
credits (AF.8) arise, which are not included 
in Maastricht debt (negative DDA). In add-
ition, shifts within the composition of net 
fi  nancial assets (purely fi  nancial transac-
tions) can give rise to DDAs, for example if 
available cash reserves are used to repay 
debt. This leads to a balance sheet reduc-
tion and debt declines without the shift 
producing a change in the fi  scal balance 
(negative DDA).6 On the other hand, a bal-
ance sheet extension occurs, for instance, 
when advance payments are made for 
which purpose loans are taken out, but the 
expenditure is only attributable in economic 
terms to the following year’s budget. Ad-
vance payments already fi  nanced at the end 
of the year lead, on that reporting date, to 
higher government debt accompanied by 
higher other accounts receivable (AF.8) on 
the asset side (positive DDA). When the ex-
penditure is recorded in the government 
non- fi  nancial accounts in the following 
year, the other accounts receivable that 
were built up at the end of the previous 
year (given an unchanged Maastricht debt) 
are reduced (negative DDA).7
In addition to such transaction- based 
causes, reclassifi  cations or valuation effects 
can also give rise to DDAs. These are not 
refl  ected in the fi  scal balance as, according 
to the ESA, the fi  scal balance comprises 
only transactions which are conducted by 
mutual agreement between the parties 
concerned or are based on a legal obliga-
tion substantiated by the government. If 
statistical units are added to or removed 
from the general government sector (reclas-
sifi  cation), this usually leads to a change in 
debt but not in the fi  scal balance of general government sector. DDAs stemming from 
valuation effects can arise, for example, as 
a result of exchange rate fl  uctuations when 
foreign currency debt is not hedged, as the 
amount of debt converted into euro 
changes without a transaction affecting the 
fi  scal balance.
Unexplained statistical discrepancies
Moreover, differences can arise between 
the fi  scal balance and the change in debt 
that cannot be traced back to specifi  cally 
identifi  ed DDAs. Such cases are referred to 
as “statistical discrepancies”. These are at-
tributable to the fact that the government 
non- fi  nancial accounts and the fi  nancial ac-
counts are not based on a fully integrated 
accounting system as a single statistical 
basis. Instead, to determine stocks and 
fl  ows, different basic statistics must be used 
which may not always be compatible with 
the ESA or consistent with each other. For 
this reason, the implementation of these 
data in the fi  nancial and non- fi  nancial gov-
ernment accounts can cause non- fi  nancial 
transactions, fi  nancial transactions or stock 
5 DDAs are positive if the increase in debt exceeds the 
defi  cit or if the decrease in debt falls short of the sur-
plus. The opposite is true in the case of negative DDAs. 
Positive DDAs are generally due to an increase in fi  nan-
cial assets and negative DDAs to a reduction of fi  nan-
cial assets.
6 This also applies when privatisation proceeds from 
the sale of shares are used to repay debt. The credit- 
fi  nanced purchase of fi  nancial assets at market price, 
for example in the context of a resolution agency 
(“bad bank”), on the other hand, leads to a positive 
DDA. Although gross debt rises, the fi  nancial assets 
rise at the same time, leaving the fi  scal balance un-
changed. However, the fi  scal balance falls if fi  nancial 
assets are bought at a price above their market value, 
or, alternatively, above an independent market value 
estimate. In such a case, the debt increases more 
strongly than the fi  nancial assets. This gap describes a 
capital transfer from general government to the previ-
ous owner which is recorded in the non- fi  nancial gov-
ernment accounts, impacting on the defi  cit. No DDA 
therefore arises for this amount.
7 Maastricht debt is calculated as at a given reporting 
date, whereas the fi  scal year for many budgetary items 
has not yet ended by that point in time. Deviations 
between the fi  scal balance and the change in debt are 
therefore to be expected.Deutsche Bundesbank

variables (such as the debt) to be incorrectly 
reported. Discrepancies can arise because, 
for instance, coverage in a set of basic stat-
istics is incomplete (data gaps), different 
statistics use diverging defi  nitions or differ-
ent data sources overlap, leading to double 
counting. Similarly, reporting entities might 
classify counterparties under incorrect sec-
tors or make erroneous entries in their stat-
istical reports. In this respect, statistical dis-
crepancies may result in the fi  scal balance, 
the change in debt and/ or the identifi  ed 
DDAs being incorrect. As DDAs forge a link 
between the defi  cit and debt, Eurostat uses 
them as a quality control instrument. Per-
sistently high statistical discrepancies can 
point to data quality issues, potentially also 
in terms of the Maastricht criteria. This 
makes it especially important that they are 
analysed in the context of European budget-
ary surveillance. For example, in Greece in 
2004, high discrepancies with sharply rising 
government debt on the one hand and 
comparatively low reported defi  cits on the 
other indicated quality issues with the Greek 
government fi  nance statistics, the full ex-
tent of which then became apparent as the 
fi  nancial and economic crisis unfolded.
Defi  cit- debt adjustments in Germany
Germany faces particular challenges due to 
its federal structure. Many government en-
tities are not included in budgetary plans 
and a number of heterogeneous public 
accounting  systems exist which, for the 
most part, are not integrated. In terms of 
the European requirements, necessary data 
cannot always be readily extracted from the 
existing systems. The statistics of govern-
ment revenue and expenditure (relevant for 
calculating the defi  cit) as well as the debt 
statistics do, in principle, have a long trad-
ition and are therefore fi  rmly anchored at 
the reporting government entities. How-
ever, the European obligations, which have 
been extended and expanded upon over time, partly deviate from the traditional 
national  transmission programme.
As a result, problems in the consolidation of 
fi  nancial relations within the general gov-
ernment sector arise, for example. It would 
be necessary here to make a clear distinc-
tion in the accounting systems and there-
fore in the statistics between transactions 
carried out with units of the general gov-
ernment sector, with public corporations or 
with private entities.8 Although section 49a 
of the Budget Principles Act (Haushalts-
grundsätzegesetz) stipulates that the ac-
counting standards used by central and 
state government should also take the re-
quirements of the NA into consideration, 
the existing general government (and local) 
budgetary classifi  cation systems and ac-
counting frameworks only partially guaran-
tee this.9 Additionally, certain transactions 
in fi  nancial assets have to be derived from 
secondary data sources, such as banking 
statistics, and thus indirectly from statistical 
reports submitted by the government’s 
counterparties, since the prevailing single- 
entry accounting system does not record 
fi  nancial assets in a full and integrated man-
ner. In this context, consistencies may crop 
up, the causes of which can ultimately only 
be identifi  ed to a limited extent.
8 A particular challenge arises from the fact that the 
sector classifi  cation of government entities is reviewed 
annually, resulting in possible changes in the allocation 
of transactions to government and non- government 
counterparties in public accounting. Sometimes, sev-
eral hundred units change sector in one year. To ensure  
that transactions are correctly recorded in the statistics 
at all times, it would have to be possible to keep track 
of the sector classifi  cation of transaction counterpar-
ties automatically using a uniform identifi  cation code.

tricht debt, see pp 69-71.

not always be ensured that account is taken of the 
requirements with regard to statistics; see Final fi  nd-

With its proposal regarding the introduction 
of harmonised European public sector ac-
counting standards (EPSAS), the European 
Commission aims to improve the quality of, 
and harmonise the underlying data basis for 
European budgetary surveillance. In a spe-
cial report on this topic, the Federal Court 
of Auditors ( Bundesrechnungshof  or BRH) 
points out that the NA fi  nancial data should, 
in principle, come from public accounting 
systems.10 Moreover, if the required infor-
mation is not contained there, it could, in 
the BRH’s view, be derived from other 
sources.11 But this is precisely what often 
proves to be very diffi   cult in practice, and 
the Commission’s proposal seeks, among 
other things, to take account of the fact 
that other sources are not always complete 
and of a suitable quality. Regardless of 
whether the EPSAS or another integrated 
system is introduced, the quality of statistics 
likely depends essentially on whether the 
required data can be directly obtained from 
the underlying accounts. In the event of a system changeover, transition costs would 
arise, and preparing accounts would likely 
be time- consuming and prone to error for a 
transition period. Under the present circum-
stances, however, statistics needed to de-
termine the fi  scal balance, the debt and 
DDAs will be permanently fraught with 
similar problems.
The DDAs for general government in Ger-
many in the last four years came to be-
tween -0.2% and +0.6% of GDP , the unex-
plained statistical discrepancies to between 
-0.1% and -0.3% of GDP . Overall, the latter 
are likely to be primarily the result of ambi-
guities in transactions in government fi  nan-
cial assets based on heterogeneous and 
sometimes incoherent data sources.

deficit-debt adjustments in 2017
1 Positive DDA components are indicated by an arrow pointing to the right, negative components by an arrow pointing to the left. Thus, 
in 2017 there was an increase in financial assets in AF.2, a decrease in AF.3 etc. 2 These mainly include transactions in financial liabilities 
as well as adjustments due to the valuation of change in debt at face value. Central government received €24 bn from nuclear power 
plant operators in 2017 for the nuclear waste management services it will provide in future. This indemnity increased its deposits (assets) 
and other liabilities correspondingly. This transaction did not directly affect the debt or the fiscal  balance, but was reflected solely in the 
aforementioned DDA components.

cial project database.41 As a result, all PPP pro -
jects and the associated liabilities derived from 
model- based compilations are captured in 
Maastricht debt.
Since the beginning of the decade, various 
German Federal states have launched large-  
scale debt relief programmes for their local 
governments. These programmes are set up in 
varying ways. In Hesse and Lower Saxony, re -
structured but not yet fully redeemed liabilities 
are no longer reported in the debt statistics.42 
By assumption, they are added to Maastricht 
debt as long- term loan debt.
In addition, loan components from financial 
derivative transactions as well as their restruc -
turings43 are taken into account, although 
these play only a minor role in Germany. In this 
context, individual annual figures from the Fed -
eral Ministry of Finance and the state finance 
ministries are used.44
Finally, in addition to the aforementioned liabil -
ities to be added, methodological and valu -
ation adjustments also need to be made. The 
not insignificant number of reclassifications of 
entities into and out of the general govern -
ment sector necessitates conversions and back 
calculations for previous years.45 Since the pub -
lic finance statistics are generally not revised, 
most of the calculations are based on esti -
mates.46
In the case of inflation- linked securities, the 
regulations on compiling Maastricht debt re -
quire that the increase in liabilities resulting 
from inflation that has already been accrued 
must also be factored into Maastricht debt. In 
addition, a correction is made for the discount 
securities reported at issue price in the debt 
statistics, as Maastricht debt requires reporting 
at face value (nominal value correction).Debts owed to the public

Berater der öffentlichen Hand GmbH. This company was 
founded in 2008 by the Federal Ministry of Finance and 
what was at the time the Federal Ministry of Transport, 
Building and Urban Development to provide consultation 
to public contracting authorities in order to promote PPPs. 
In addition, data from the central and state government 
sectors are reconciled with the budget plans. Likewise, fur -
ther information based on press releases and Internet re -
search is taken into consideration. The debt statistics do 
also include liabilities from PPPs. However, only the project 
totals, and not the specific investment volumes in each in -
dividual period, are captured. The latter are necessary in 
order to capture the debt effect of the PPP during the con -
struction phase. Moreover, there is a lack of data regarding 
the duration of the construction and utilisation phases in 
order to be able to model the accrual of debt and its grad -
ual repayment. Since the 2016 reporting year, the debt 
statistics have captured, alongside PPPs, investment vol -
umes for energy performance contracts (EPCs). As is the 
case for PPPs, the Federal Statistical Office models the influ -
ence of these on Maastricht debt.
42 In the case of the safety net for local governments in 
the state of Hesse, the state- owned Wirtschafts- und In -
frastrukturbank Hessen (WI- Bank) has redeemed liabilities, 
with the state government rather than the respective local 
governments making repayments. The Lower Saxony debt 
relief fund provides debt service assistance for financially 
weak local governments, which sell on the resulting claims 
against the Norddeutsche Landesbank (NordLB) and use 
the income to repay their cash advances. The sale of these 
claims ultimately creates liabilities of the state government 
vis- à- vis NordLB.
43 Standard financial derivatives at market conditions 
(AF.7) are not part of Maastricht debt. However, if they are 
not standard or not at market conditions, resulting in the 
general government initially receiving payments from the 
counterparty that de facto need to be repaid during the 
term of the derivative, the financial derivative contains a 
loan component. This needs to be separated accordingly 
and captured as loan debt in Maastricht debt.
44 No information is available for local government, and 
no additions were made. However, at least in the past, 
complex financial derivative transactions were concluded 
to reduce interest expenditure (including in relation to the 
exchange rate against the Swiss franc).
45 Public entities are reclassified if they pass (reclassifica -
tion out of the general government sector) or do not pass 
(reclassification into the general government sector) what 
is known as the quantitative market test (production cost 
coverage rate through sales higher than 50%).
46 Generally, the debt of non- financial entities for the past 
four reporting years is back estimated using these entities’ 
national accounts deficits compiled by the Federal Statis -
tical Office with the assumption of no DDAs (see also the 
box on pp 65-68). By contrast, back calculations for gov -
ernment holdings are currently based on the development 
of financial assets according to financial statement data.Deutsche Bundesbank

the public sector.47 These figures comprise only 
loan debt owed to core budgets, on the one 
hand, and to public funds, institutions and 
enter prises, on the other. This second group of 
creditors, in turn, comprises not only govern -
ment off-  budget entities but also non-  
governmental other public funds, institutions 
and enterprises (OPFIEs48). While loan debt 
owed to core budgets and off- budget entities 
does not form part of Maastricht debt due to 
consolidation, credit liabilities vis- à- vis non-  
governmental OPFIEs are included. However, 
since the debt statistics do not differentiate be -
tween off- budget entities and OPFIEs, the fi -
nancial asset stock statistics are used as assis -tance, as these record the loan debt of core 
budgets owed to off- budget entities in their 
loan portfolios.49 Both sets of statistics are, 
however, only compatible to a limited extent, 
meaning that individual corrections and esti -
mates are required. With regard to European Loan debt owed

requirements, it would be appropriate here to 
fully implement the general government sector 
delineation in the public accounting system.
Securities- based debt relations between gov -
ernment entities, which are reported under 
debts owed to the non-  public sector in the 
debt statistics, are also to be consolidated.50 
Also used for this are the financial asset stock 
statistics, which report securities- based debt of 
core budgets owed to other government 
entities  as the latters’ securities holdings, and 
estimates are also necessary here in some 
cases.51
Adjustments related to 
support  measures for banks
Maastricht debt also includes additions and ad -
justments related to government measures to 
support the financial market. First, the debt of 
Sealink Funding (the “bad bank” of the former 
SachsenLB) and Portigon (legal successor of the 
former WestLB) are taken into account, as 
these are, respectively, an institution domiciled 
abroad and a holder of a banking licence, and 
are not captured in the public finance statistics. 
Second, due to their significant financial assets, 
specific calculations based on individual figures 
are carried out for all state- owned “bad banks”. 
These aim to ensure consistent compilations of 
both the debt as well as the financial assets in 
the balance sheet context, and are therefore 
used in place of the volumes reported in the 
debt statistics.52
Developments in Germany’s 
Maastricht debt since 1991
Figures for Germany’s Maastricht debt are 
available dating back to 1991.53 During this 
period, the debt ratio (as a percentage of GDP) 
rose from its initial level of 39% to reach 81% 
in 2010, before falling again perceptibly over 
the last few years to its current level of 64% 
(64.1%, or €2,093 billion, to be precise).Developments during the 1990s were heavily 
influenced by the fallout from German reunifi -
cation. Between the end of 1991 and the end 
of 1999, Germany’s overall Maastricht debt 
doubled from €618 billion to €1,239 billion,54 
causing the debt ratio to rise to 60%. The in -
crease in debt primarily took place at the cen -
tral government level, with the impact being 
concentrated mainly on its special funds (off-  
budget entities). The German Unity Fund and 
the Debt Processing Fund were established in 
1990 and were used, amongst other things, to 
fund the rebuilding of eastern Germany’s econ -
omy, to assume liabilities from the state budget 
of the GDR, and to cover the burdens arising 
from the currency changeover in eastern Ger -
many.55 Both funds were classified as belong -Consolidation of

50 As the parties subject to reporting requirements are un -
able to disclose the holders of their securities- based debt, 
the debt statistics record all of these liabilities in a simplified 
manner as holdings owed to the non- public sector.
51 The securities- based debt between the core budgets 
and off- budget entities of central government are consoli -
dated using individual figures. The financial asset stock 
statistics do not allow for consolidation of securities- based 
debt relationships between governmental off- budget 
entities  , as government accounting practices do not en -
tirely delineate the general government sector. Further -
more, the financial asset stock statistics for the current re -
porting year are not yet available for the spring notifica -
tion. For the majority of the positions, projections are made 
based on the values from the previous year and the Bundes-
bank’s securities holdings statistics.
52 Annual reports and notifications in the format of the 
Bundesbank monthly balance sheet statistics are used as a 
basis for this. The debts compiled on this basis deviate 
slightly from the liabilities reported within the debt statis -
tics. This could be caused by differences regarding the 
timeliness of the booking status. The notifications from 
“bad banks” within the scope of the debt statistics also 
record accrued interest, which is not captured in Maas -
tricht debt (report at face value, see pp 61-62).
53 For the period from 1950 up to and including 1990, 
data for West Germany are only available as more narrowly 
defined in the national public finance statistics. The data 
presented in this section take into account any revisions (eg 
methodological changes) in the NA time series. Key figures 
may therefore differ from earlier data sets.

ing to the general government sector (the debt 
of both entities stood at €40 billion at the end 
of 1991). By contrast, the Treuhand agency, 
which was established to facilitate the privat -
isation and restructuring of East German firms, 
was allocated to the corporate sector as its 
core business was considered to be a market-  
based activity. The considerable shortfalls aris -
ing from the privatisation of the former GDR 
state- owned enterprises, which had not origin -
ally been expected, led to the accumulation of 
substantial debts outside the government sec -
tor at first. In 1995, the debts accumulated by 
the Treuhand agency were finally transferred to 
the Redemption Fund for Inherited Liabilities, 
which, as a newly created special fund belong -
ing to central government, was included in the 
government sector.56 The debt assumptions, 
which were recorded in the national accounts 
as a capital transfer to the corporate sector 
with an impact on the deficit, amounted to a 
total of €122 billion (6½% of GDP) in 1995.57
Until the mid-1990s, the increase in general 
government debt significantly outstripped def -
icits, which were already high. One of the main 
reasons for these (positive) deficit- debt adjust -
ments (DDAs)58 was that the equalisation 
claims allocated in connection with the cur -
rency changeover and the subsequent debt re -
lief for enterprises capable of being privatised 
had no impact on the deficit in the period 
under review, but did increase the debt level 
(€33 billion, or 2% of GDP).59 In addition, as a 
result of the railway reform and the creation of 
Deutsche Bahn AG in 1994, the liabilities of the 
Federal Railways and the East German Reichs -
bahn  (€34 billion or 2% of GDP), both assigned 
to the corporate sector, were allocated to the 
newly established Federal Railways Fund, an -
other central government off- budget entity. 
This was not reflected in the deficit either, but 
did lead to an increase in debt.
In the second half of the 1990s, general gov -
ernment deficits then began to fall gradually 
and debt levels rose at a slower pace. In 2000, 
owing to the one- off proceeds of €51 billion (2½% of GDP) received by general government 
from the auction of UMTS licences, a surplus 
was recorded for the first time since German 
reunification. However, this revenue only had a 
partial impact on the debt level at first. Instead, 
part of it was invested temporarily, and it was 
not used to limit the growth in debt until the 
following year. Repayments from the UMTS 
auction proceeds temporarily brought the debt 
ratio back down to 58% at the end of 2001.60
Until the mid-2000s, large general government 
deficits then consistently continued to be re -
corded (and the 3% threshold was exceeded), 
meaning that debt rose more quickly and the 
60% threshold was significantly exceeded as of 
2003. However, the disposal of financial assets 
went some way towards slowing the rise in 
debt.61

56 In addition, the Redemption Fund for Inherited Liabil -
ities assumed the debts of the Debt Processing Fund, which 
was already classified in the general government sector, 
thereby dissolving it.
57 At the beginning of 1995, the debts from the Treuhand 
agency assumed by the Redemption Fund for Inherited 
Liabilities  amounted to €105 billion (excluding accrued 
interest). See: Deutsche Bundesbank, Trends in public sec -
tor debt since German unification, Monthly Report, March 
1997, pp 17-31. Further capital transfers resulted from the 
assumption of the debts of East German housing enter -
prises. These were counterbalanced, to a lesser extent, by 
relief from capital transfers received through the assump -
tion of the assets of Deutsche Kreditbank. However, these 
effects were not counted as increasing the deficit in the 
context of the excessive deficit procedure. The Maastricht 
deficit recorded in 1995 was therefore around €119 billion 
lower on balance than the NA figure.

61 In several cases, shares owned by central government 
were transferred to KfW as part of holding arrangements. 
In this context, privatisation receipts were budgeted for, 
which prevented the borrowing limits from being breached 
in the budget planning process. However, since the au -
tumn 2005 notification, these transactions have been clas -
sified as central government borrowing from KfW in the 
national accounts, since no economic transfer of owner -

From the middle of the last decade, absolute 
debt growth receded in light of a significant 
improvement in the macroeconomic situation 
and declining deficits. Between 2005 and 2007, 
the debt ratio fell from a temporary high of 
67% to 64% as a result of the increase in nom -
inal GDP .
From 2008 onwards, debt developments were 
driven by the consequences of the financial 
and sovereign debt crisis and the government 
financial market support measures and assis -
tance loans granted to euro area sovereigns in 
this context. The first of these measures in -
volved shifting toxic assets from WestLB and 
SachsenLB to the two dedicated special pur -
pose vehicles established for this purpose: 
Phoenix and Sealink Funding.62 As a result of 
the ring- fencing provided by the state govern -
ment owners, these “bad banks” and thus their 
toxic assets and liabilities were recorded as part 
of the government sector (allocated to the 
state government level). This caused the Maas -
tricht debt level to rise by €38 billion (1½% of 
GDP) as early as 2008.63 In addition, a number 
of institutions were supported by means of 
capital injections. By the end of 2010, capital 
injections totalling €47 billion (2% of GDP) had 
been granted to Commerzbank AG, BayernLB, 
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), LBBW, WestLB, 
HSH Nordbank AG, IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG and Aareal Bank AG. Of these, only a small 
part –  capital injections to HRE, IKB and 
WestLB  – were recorded as capital transfers 
and thus as having an impact on the deficit.
By far the largest increase in debt was attribut -
able to the assumption of toxic assets belong -
ing to HRE by the state- owned “bad bank” 
FMS  Wertmanagement (FMSW), which con -
tributed €189 billion (7½% of GDP) to the 
Maastricht debt at the end of 2010. The off -
loading of additional toxic assets from WestLB 
to the Erste Abwicklungsanstalt (EAA) reso -
lution agency caused the debt level for 2010 to 
rise by a further €21 billion (1% of GDP).64
At the end of 2010, the overall debt ratio 
reached its peak to date at 81%, or €2,088 bil -
lion. Of this, €306 billion (12% of GDP) was 
attributable to measures supporting financial Economic

Change in Maastricht debt
62 At the end of 2017, almost all of the remaining assets of 
Sealink Funding were sold on the capital market, meaning 
that the corresponding liabilities are likely to be scaled back 
soon.
63 Furthermore, in 2009, the Federal state of Baden-  
Württemberg issued a guarantee amounting to roughly 
€13 billion (½% of GDP) to cover the risk stemming from a 
reference portfolio belonging to LBBW. The refinancing of 
the cash deposit held as collateral increased the debt level 
accordingly.
64 Besides this, in 2010, the EAA assumed the assets and 
liabilities of Phoenix in the original amount of €23 billion. 
However, Phoenix was already part of the government sec -
tor, and thus counted towards Maastricht debt.Deutsche Bundesbank

institutions.65 In this context, developments in 
deficit and debt levels clearly followed diver -
gent paths. For instance, in cumulative terms, 
at €39 billion (1½% of GDP), only a fraction of 
the financial market support measures granted 
up to that point had a direct impact on the def -
icit. This was mainly because the toxic assets 
purchased and the equity capital injected were 
considered to be recoverable to a large extent, 
meaning that the increase in debt was thus off -
set by an acquisition of financial assets.66 By 
the end of 2010, the acquisition of financial 
assets therefore resulted in positive DDAs of 
€267 billion (10½% of GDP) in cumulative 
terms.
The next few years saw the start of a gradual 
process in which the financial assets acquired 
as a result of the crisis were liquidated and the 
equity injected was repaid. Taken by itself, this 
caused a decline in the debt level and, mirror -
ing previous developments, DDAs that were 
now negative. However, the granting of assis -
tance loans to some euro area countries in the 
aftermath of the sovereign debt crisis,67 as well 
as the assumption of other risk assets by the 
EAA, in particular, more than offset this debt 
reduction process.68 This resulted in a net in -
crease in debt. Since it was assumed that the 
assistance loans would be repaid in full at a 
later date, they were recorded as the purchase 
of financial assets with no impact on the def -
icit, thus leading to a positive DDA. The same 
applied to the paid- in capital provided by Ger -
many to the European Stability Mechanism 
(ESM), which was used to settle the European 
assistance loans granted from mid-2012.69 The 
increases in debt were therefore higher than 
the respective deficits until 2012. In 2012, ab -
solute debt reached an all- time high of €2,202 
billion (debt ratio of 80%). At the same time, 
the impact on debt it contained as a result of 
the financial and sovereign debt crisis also 
peaked at a total of €360 billion.70
From 2013, the debt level also decreased in ab -
solute terms on the whole, and the debt ratio 
declined significantly owing to nominal GDP growth in the ratio’s denominator. However, 
the very favourable budgetary situation, which 
included surpluses, also contributed to this, 
although  these surpluses were only partially 
reflected  in a decrease in debt. In particular, 
surpluses generated by local governments and 
the (largely debt- free) social security funds not 
only led to debt repayments, but also to a 
build- up of financial assets in these govern -
ment subsectors.71 However, from a general 
government perspective, this was counterbal -
anced by the portfolio decrease at the “bad

65 Indirect effects from financial market support measures, 
eg assumed funding costs or revenue from guarantee fees, 
are also taken into account here.
66 For this reason, the bulk of the government’s expend -
iture on the purchase was considered a financial transac -
tion without any impact on the deficit. Any revaluations of 
assets after a transfer generally have no impact on the def -
icit because they are not viewed as transactions.
67 Bilateral loans were granted to Greece via KfW on be -
half of and for the account of Germany’s central govern -
ment (since 2011: €15 billion or ½% of GDP). In addition, 
the assistance loans granted via the European Financial Sta -
bility Facility (EFSF) to Ireland, Portugal and Greece, as well 
as the assumed liabilities from their funding, were allocated 
in economic terms to the guarantor euro area countries 
according to their share in the ECB’s capital key (peaking at 
€55 billion or almost 2% of GDP for Germany).
68 “Topping up” the EAA increased the debt level by €24 
billion in 2012. By contrast, the reclassification of Portigon, 
the successor to WestLB, to the general government sector 
increased the debt figure for 2012 by only €3½ billion since 
the bulk of the assets and liabilities had already been trans -
ferred to the EAA.
69 Unlike EFSF loans, for loans granted via the ESM, the 
corresponding assets and liabilities are not assigned to the 
creditor countries. In contrast to the EFSF, Eurostat decided 
that the ESM, as an independent institution, would be 
classified  outside the government sector, as it is evidently 
assumed that lending and borrowing take place mainly at 
the ESM’s own risk. Nevertheless, from an economic per -
spective, the creditor countries remain exposed to risk due 
to the additional callable capital, and ultimately decide on 
the granting of loans. Between 2012 and 2014, Germany 
provided paid- in capital to the ESM totalling €22 billion. 
Loans granted by the EU from its own budget via the Euro -
pean Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM) are not re -
flected in the debt levels of the EU member states, either.
70 Germany’s share of all European assistance loans and 
paid- in capital to the ESM increased to €91 billion (or 3% 
of GDP) by the end of 2014, and, since 2015, has stood at 
€88 billion (currently 2½% of GDP).
71 For the most part, these were not invested in debt in -
struments issued by other government sector entities. 
Otherwise, this would have resulted in consolidation and a 
lower Maastricht debt level.Deutsche Bundesbank

banks”,72 resulting in negative DDAs on bal -
ance.
At the end of 2017, the debt level stood at 
€2,093 billion (64.1% of GDP). Of this, the 
aforementioned effects from the financial and 
sovereign debt crisis amounted to €282 billion, 
or 8½% of GDP . The extent to which Maas -
tricht debt decreases in the future will depend 
on the pace at which risk assets continue to be 
effectively liquidated by the “bad banks” and 
assistance loans granted bilaterally or via the 
EFSF are repaid. Beyond this, not least in light 
of the strict borrowing limits under the national 
debt brake and a continued marked increase in 
nominal GDP , the Maastricht debt ratio can be 
expected to further significantly decline over 
the following years and to fall below the 60% 
limit by 2019 at the latest.
Borrower structure
Looking at the contribution of the government 
subsectors to the Maastricht debt level, the 
share attributable to central government 
climbed by 7 percentage points to 63% by the 
mid-1990s on account of the fiscal burdens 
created by German reunification, while the 
state government share (despite significant 
debt increases in absolute terms) fell by 5 per -
centage points to 26%. Until the beginning of 
the 2000s, central government’s share re -
mained more or less constant, but then de -
creased over time as the proceeds from the 
UMTS auction were used for debt repayment, 
stabilising at around 60%. However, FMSW’s 
assumption of HRE’s risk assets caused central 
government’s share to jump back up by 3 per -
centage points in 2010, although financial mar -
ket support measures had also been taken at 
the state government level. The share at the 
local government level has fallen constantly 
since the beginning of the 1990s, from 13% in 
1991 to a stable level of 7% since 2010. As a 
rule, social security funds cannot be debt 
financed . Although the deficits of the statutory 
health insurance institutions were partially financed  through bank loans in the first half of 
the 2000s, this took place on a relatively small Maastricht debt 
likely to decline 
further as things

72 This was by no means a steady process. For instance, 
changes in market interest rates led to considerable 
changes in the market value of the derivative positions of 
FMSW. Although they are not part of the Maastricht debt 
themselves, cash collateral must normally be provided for 
derivative liabilities, which generally means that borrowing 
is required or prevents repayments from being made. For 
claims arising from derivative positions, cash collateral is 
received and, at the same time, recorded (enlarging the 
balance sheet) as a repayable loan on the liabilities side. In 
addition, FMSW’s purchase of liabilities from the Irish sub -
sidiary Depfa temporarily expanded the balance sheet. Be -
sides this, in 2015, the EAA assumed financial assets be -
longing to the EAA Covered Bond Bank, albeit to a lesser 
extent. The establishment of HSH Portfoliomanagement as 
a state- owned “bad bank” of HSH Nordbank in 2016 also 
played a small role in the delayed reduction of the debt 
stemming from the financial market crisis.Deutsche Bundesbank

scale. Because the social security funds are sim -
ultaneously creditors to other levels of govern -
ment (and these intra- government debts are 
consolidated), their contribution to the Maas -
tricht debt level – measured as the difference 
between their own debts minus claims on 
other levels of government  – is negative in 
most years.73
Structure of debt instruments
In terms of types of debt, a persistent trend 
towards   marketable forms of debt such as 
money or capital market instruments can be identified for general government in the period 
under review. The share of these increased 
from 50% in 1991 to 73% by 2009. Through 
the establishment of FMSW, which entailed the 
transfer of liabilities from HRE in 2010, the 
weight of loan- based debt went back up sig -
nificantly for a time. In the following years, 
however, the trend towards marketable debt 
instruments resumed from a lower level, reach -
ing a share of almost three- quarters again of 
late.
Looking at the individual government levels, 
considerable differences are visible in terms of 
structure and development. While central gov -
ernment financed around 75% of its borrowing 
through capital market instruments at the be -
ginning of the 1990s, this share amounted to 
just 12% for the state governments as they 
relied  more heavily on bank loans. However, 
apart from a period in the second half of the 
1990s which saw greater loan financing, the 
share of capital market instruments at the ag -
gregate state government level rose steadily to 
58% by the end of 2017.74 At the central gov -
ernment level, this figure stood at 84% at the 
end of 2017.
Among marketable instruments, money market 
paper played a noteworthy role for many years 
primarily at the central government level. In the 
wake of the financial and economic crisis, cen -
tral government considerably increased its ac -
tivity in this sector for a time. In 2009, the out -
standing volume more than doubled to 10%, 
covering a substantial part of the financing 
require  ments. The gradual decline in central 
government’s core budget money market bor -
rowing over the following years was partly off -
set by issuances by FMSW. At state government 
level, money market instruments only became 
more important through issuances made by the 
EAA. However, at a temporary high of 3% in

2012, they accounted for just a small propor -
tion of state government debt.
Turning to loan debt, the share of long-  term 
loans in central government’s total debt fell 
from 20% in the mid-1990s to below 4% at 
the end of 2009, but then went back up to 9% 
by 2013. This was due to assistance loans pro -
vided by central government to other euro area 
member states through KfW and the EFSF. Until 
2009, central government’s share of short- term 
loans hovered below 4%. When FMSW was set 
up in 2010, HRE’s financing structure, which 
was geared towards short- term loans in the 
interbank market, was transferred to central 
government. The share of short- term loans 
shot up to 13% as a result, but went back 
down to below the 4% mark by the end of 
2017. At state government level, the share of 
long- term loans decreased from 86% at the 
end of 1991 – conversely to the accumulation 
of long- term debt securities – to 37% at the 
end of 2017. At local government level, after 
increasing significantly, long- term loan debt 
remained  virtually unchanged at an absolute 
level of around €100 billion until the mid-1990s. 
By contrast, particularly from the beginning of 
the 2000s, stocks of short-  term loans, espe -
cially cash advances, rose substantially to over 
€50 billion in 2015, but fell to €44 billion at the 
end of 2017, not least on account of favourable 
budgetary developments.75 While the share 
was still below 4% in 1991, just under one-  
third of local government debt is now financed 
through cash advances and short- term loans.76 
However, there are marked differences be -
tween individual municipalities, and their out -
standing cash advances are heavily concen -
trated in just a few Federal states.77
Outlook
Germany’s Maastricht debt is mainly compiled 
on the basis of the official debt statistics, which, 
in principle, include all entities allocated to the 
general government sector. The debt statistics 
have been the tried and tested survey method for decades. However, statistical data require -
ments at the European level have increased sig -
nificantly over time, mainly owing to negative 
experiences with the quality of Greece’s data 
and the resulting difficulties in assessing the 
sustainability of its public finances. This means 
that Germany’s statistical system is facing chal -
lenges in general, but also with regard to the 
Maastricht debt compilations.
It is difficult to satisfy the growing data needs 
at the European level and the stricter quality 
requirements for a number of outsourced gov -
ernment activities from several very different 
– and often unintegrated – public accounting 
systems, with the single- entry system being by 
far the largest overall. In this context, the re -
quirements cannot always be readily met by 
the existing systems of government entities. 
For instance, it is sometimes necessary to tap 
indirect data sources that are primarily intended 
for other purposes and that are potentially in -
consistent with the main accounting systems. 
However, discrepancies can also arise because 
the necessary consolidation of financial rela -
tions within the government sector cannot be 
fully derived from the accounting system in 
place.78
Although, on the whole, Germany’s existing 
budgetary and finance statistics systems are 
well established and largely provide a reliable 
picture of the single- entry system, the obliga -Bank bail- outs 
and assistance

75 The heterogeneity in the financial situation of the muni -
cipalities can be seen by looking at the simultaneous build- 
up of municipal financial assets of more than €70 billion, 
which are likely to reflect investments by wealthy local gov -
ernments, in particular.
76 Cash advances are classified here as short- term loans. In 
some Federal states, the rules for such loans, which were 
actually only intended to bridge liquidity shortages, have 
now been eased significantly, however, meaning that ma -
turities of up to ten years are now permitted and also seem 
to be in use.

finances : development and selected aspects, Monthly 
Report , October 2016, pp 13-36.
78 Meanwhile, a reform of the particularly important gov -
ernment budgetary planning system is underway to estab -
lish clear delineation. However, since an entity’s sector clas -
sification can be revised, information about the transaction 
counterparties should also ultimately be retained (automat -
ically) for all units.Deutsche Bundesbank

tions entered into at the European level have 
only been partially accompanied by corres -
ponding adjustments to the national public ac -
counting system. The establishment of an ex -
pert panel through the Budget Principles Act 
(Haushaltsgrundsätzegesetz)  to ensure that the 
various government accounting standards also 
take into account the statistical requirements 
of the national accounts is a welcome develop -
ment. However, there is still some catching- up 
to do in certain areas. For instance, the quality 
of statistical reporting is heavily dependent on 
the accounting system on which the required data is based. Against this backdrop, it would 
generally make sense to have a far more har -
monised accounting system across general 
government that depicts revenue and expend -
iture flows with balance sheet stock data in an 
integrated way. If this aim is not pursued, it is 
important that the standard- setting bodies re -
sponsible at central and state government 
level, in particular, make efforts to close the 
current data gaps and address consistency 
issues through targeted adjustments to the 
relevant accounting systems.Deutsche Bundesbank
