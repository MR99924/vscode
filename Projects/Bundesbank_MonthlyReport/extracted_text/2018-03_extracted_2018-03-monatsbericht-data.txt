Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The German economy’s robust upswing is likely 
to have continued in the first quarter of 2018. 
Supported by an exceptionally large volume of 
orders received by firms in the second half of 
the last year, the industrial sector remains the 
driving force behind economic developments. 
According to the Ifo Institute, despite a minor 
downward revision, manufacturing firms still 
assess the business situation as very favourable. 
The marked damper in the expectations com -
ponent is not expected to have an effect until 
next quarter. In fact, the assessment of the 
business situation in the main construction sec -
tor reached a new record high, and the order 
books are in excellent shape, too. However, the 
already significant capacity shortages will prob -
ably prevent a rapid increase of construction 
activity. The construction sector’s contribution 
to aggregate growth is therefore likely to be 
moderate at best, while the persistently strong 
labour market momentum is continuing to sup -
port private consumption.
Industry
In January 2018, German industrial output was 
up distinctly on the month in seasonally ad -
justed terms (+½%). Compared with the final 
quarter of 2017, the increase, at 1½%, was 
much stronger still. With regard to the individ -
ual sectors, mechanical engineering as well as 
repairs and installation of machinery and equip -
ment reported particularly significant growth in 
output. Production in the capital goods sector 
therefore posted the strongest growth overall 
(+2¼%). Manufacturers of consumer goods 
also expanded their output sharply (+1¾%). By 
contrast, the production of intermediate goods 
remained at the same level as in the previous 
quarter.After seasonal adjustment, industrial orders de -
clined steeply in January 2018 compared with 
the previous month (-3¾%), which meant that 
they were thus also clearly down compared 
with the average of the fourth quarter of 2017 
(-2%). However, the strong contraction should 
be seen in the light of the entire second half of 
2017, when German firms reported a very ex -
tensive inflow of orders; the orders situation in 
industry can thus still be considered extremely 
positive overall. Nonetheless, the countermove -
ment was broadly based. Broken down by re -
gion, demand for German products, both in 
Germany as well as in the euro area and in 
non- euro area countries, shrank considerably. 
Excluding large orders, the volume of new 
orders declined less strongly overall (-1%). 
Broken down by individual sectors, manufac -
turers of capital goods had to cope with the 
sharpest drop in new orders, followed by inter -
mediate goods producers. By contrast, signifi -
cantly more new orders landed in the order 
books of consumer goods producers.
Industrial sales in January 2018 remained 
broadly unchanged on the month after adjust -
ment for seasonal variations. However, com -
pared with the average of the last three months 
of 2017, they increased by 1%. In regional 
terms, sales of German products showed par -
ticularly robust growth in Germany and in the 
euro area, yet industrial enterprises also re -
ported a distinct rise in sales in non- euro area 
countries. In a breakdown by sector, manufac -
turers of capital goods stood out with substan -
tial sales growth. The quite considerable sales 
growth in Germany, in particular, is likely to be 
related to the brisk investment activity at the 
current time. By contrast, sales of intermediate 
and consumer goods were down slightly from 
the previous quarter. In January, nominal ex -
ports dropped considerably on the month in 
seasonally adjusted terms (-½%). There was a 
significant increase compared with the fourth 
quarter last year, however (+¾%). After adjust -German

ment for price effects, the rise was slightly 
lower, at ½%. In January, month- on- month 
and also quarter- on- quarter (real and nominal) 
growth of nominal imports was similar to that 
of exports.
Construction
Seasonally adjusted construction output in 
January 2018 showed a steep decline on the 
month (-2¼%). It was also down significantly 
from the last quarter of 2017 (-3%). The main 
reason for the decrease was a quite consider -
able decline in construction activity in the fin -
ishing trades (-7½%). On the other hand, out -
put in the main construction sector was up 
sharply once again (+3%). The relevant indica -
tors show that the stagnation in construction 
output observed since early summer 2017 is 
likely to have been caused by supply-  side fac -
tors, and the buoyant construction activity will 
have persisted despite the dip in January. Ac -
cording to the Ifo Institute, the assessment of 
the business situation in the main construction 
sector reached a new all- time high in February. 
The same goes for equipment utilisation ac -
cording to the most recent reports by the con -
struction firms. In addition, the final quarter of 
2017 – the most recent quarter for which data 
are available – saw a surge in new orders in the 
main construction sector. In the light of a prob -
ably fairly high proportion of large orders and 
the fact that capacity is already clearly being 
overutilised, this jump in orders will probably 
only gradually lead to higher production.
Labour market
The prolonged growth in employment con -
tinued unabated at the beginning of 2018. In 
January, the total seasonally adjusted number 
of persons in work in Germany was up by 
60,000 on the month. Compared with January 
2017, the increase amounted to 625,000 per -
sons, or 1.4%. Growth in total employment 
continued to be sustained by jobs subject to Major slump

social security contributions, the number of 
which rose by as much as 711,000 (according 
to data as at December 2017) compared with 
the previous year. By contrast, there was a con -
tinuation of the downward trend in the num -
ber of persons working exclusively in low- paid 
part- time jobs and of the self- employed, al -
though this trend decelerated considerably for 
the latter group towards the end of 2017. Lead -
ing indicators of the demand for labour such as 
the Ifo employment barometer, the Federal 
Employ ment Agency’s BA-  X job index and the 
labour market barometer of the Institute for 
Employment Research (IAB) are all holding 
steady at an extremely high level.
After seasonal adjustment, unemployment in 
February again showed a significant month- on- 
month fall. There were 2.39 million persons 
registered as unemployed with the Federal Em -
ployment Agency, 22,000 fewer than in Janu -
ary. This means that the registered unemploy -
ment figure was 216,000 lower on the year. 
The unemployment rate was 5.4% at the end 
of the period under review. The relatively strong 
drop in unemployment over the past few 
months is probably also related to the fact that 
unemployment among refugees stopped in -
creasing, bringing the underlying cyclical trend 
more into the foreground. Total underemploy -
ment showed a stronger decrease recently as 
the number of persons taking part in labour 
market policy measures was likewise in gradual 
decline. The unemployment component of the 
IAB labour market barometer has decreased 
slightly at the current end but is still clearly 
positive. This suggests that unemployment will 
continue to decline in the future.
Prices
Crude oil prices fell markedly in the first half of 
February, against the background of stock mar -
ket corrections and increased US oil produc -
tion. They rebounded slightly over the course 
of the month, however. On average, prices 
were down by just over 5% from January, fall -ing again slightly in the first half of March. As 
this report went to press, the price of a barrel 
of Brent crude oil stood at US$65. The discount 
on crude oil futures was US$1¼ for deliveries 
six months ahead and US$3 for 12 months 
ahead.
Both import prices and industrial producer 
prices in domestic sales rose further in January 
in seasonally adjusted terms. The increase in 
import prices was driven by energy, while the 
decrease in prices of other goods was due to 
currency appreciation. By contrast, domestic 
prices for all goods continued to rise. As import 
prices had increased more strongly in the previ -
ous year, the corresponding growth rate went 
down to 0.7%. The growth rate of industrial 
domestic sales prices remained broadly stable 
at 2.1%, however.
In February, consumer prices (HICP) rose slightly 
by 0.1% in seasonally adjusted terms. This was 
due partly to the slight decline in energy and 
food prices. Inflation was moderate in the case 
of services, including rents. Non- energy indus -
trial goods became more expensive owing to 
the marked price increases for clothing. Never -
theless, annual inflation fell from 1.4% to 1.2% 
(CPI 1.4% from 1.6%), mainly due to the sharp 
rise in food prices in February 2017. Excluding 
energy and food, however, inflation rose to 
1.4% from 1.3%. The rate is expected to pick 
up significantly overall in March, as the Easter 
holidays, during which travel prices normally 
rise markedly, already start at the end of the 
month and not, as in 2017, in April.

Statutory health insurance

According to preliminary data, the statutory 
health insurance (SHI) scheme finished 2017 
with a surplus of €2½ billion overall. This con -

ance institutions recording a surplus of €3 bil -
lion (compared with €1½ billion in the previous 
year). As in the previous years, the health insur -
ance institutions’ surplus is predominantly at -
tributable to the fact that spending growth 
was overestimated in the budget plans, mean -
ing that the supplementary contribution rates 
were set too high. The health fund, by con -
trast, posted a deficit of €½ billion. Compared 
with 2016, the fund’s deficit narrowed by €½ 
billion despite it being required to make a spe -
cial transfer of €1½ billion to the health insur -
ance institutions. The health fund’s reserves 
amounted to €9 billion after its final transac -
tions for 2017 and thus remained almost un -changed, while the financial reserves of the 
health insurance institutions as a whole in -
creased to a total of €19 billion.1 The statutory 
upper limit of a month’s average expenditure 
has therefore been reached by the health insur -
ance institutions as a whole.
With supplementary contribution rates remain -
ing virtually unchanged on the whole, the 
health insurance institutions’ revenue (mainly 
transfers from the health fund) climbed by al -
most 4½%. By comparison, expenditure rose 
at  a more subdued rate of 3½%. Growth in 
spending on hospital treatment – the most sig -
nificant item in quantitative terms – was rela -
tively moderate at 2½%. Significantly higher 
growth had been expected here as a result of a 
legal extension of benefits. At 3½%, spending 
on remedies and therapeutic appliances rose at 
a subdued rate despite benefit increases bring -
ing about a financial burden from mid-2017. By 
contrast, outlays on pharmaceuticals (+4%) 
and out- patient treatment (+4½%) recorded 
above- average growth. On the whole, the 
3½% increase in spending on benefits was 
relatively restrained given the fact that the 
number of insured persons rose again by just 
over 1%. It would appear that these newly in -
sured persons not only have a more favourable 
age structure than that of existing insured per -
sons but, moreover, they also make less use of 
health services.2 Administrative spending was 
down slightly on the year, not least because of 
the health insurance institutions’ lower pension 
provisions.
The health fund recorded growth in revenue of 
4½% in 2017. Contribution receipts from per -

1 Each statutory health insurance institution, as well as the 
health fund, is required to hold minimum reserves of one- 
quarter of a month’s average expenditure (sections 261 (2) 
and 271 (2) of the Social Security Code Book V). This cur -
rently corresponds to a sum of €5 billion for the health in -
surance institutions and €4½ billion for the health fund.

ployment subject to social security contribu -
tions and a rise in per capita earnings. Follow -
ing the somewhat more moderate pension in -
crease in mid-2017, contributions paid for old- 
age pensioners were up by a slightly smaller 
rate (4%). Turning to other revenue items, the 
increase in the central government grant (€½ 
billion) to its new standard level of €14½ billion 
per year made a positive impact. By contrast, at 
just under 4½%, spending by the health fund 
(which essentially determines the health insur -
ance institutions’ revenue and which (with the 
exception of administrative spending) is deter -
mined prior to the start of the year and not 
adjusted as it progresses) rose at a somewhat 
slower pace than revenue despite the above-  
mentioned one- off special transfer to the 
health insurance institutions.
Last autumn, the group of SHI estimators had 
forecast a small deficit of €½ billion in the 
health fund for 2018 (as well as for 2017). The 
risk- adjusted transfers to the health insurance institutions were fixed at the level of estimated 
revenue,3 which thus means that after factor -
ing in administrative spending, the result is ex -
pected to be balanced. However, the fund is 
still required to make transfers of €½ billion to 
the innovation and structural funds, and these 
are to be drawn from the liquidity reserve.4 On 
balance, the reserve will thus fall slightly but 
will still significantly exceed the statutory min -
imum. The upward revision of the macroeco -
nomic growth assumptions (for instance in the

4 The innovation fund is used by the health fund and 
health insurance institutions to provide annual funding of 
€300 million, starting in 2016 and ending in 2019, for in -
novations in healthcare provision and related research. 
Funding provided by the structural fund (totalling €500 mil -
lion) is channelled into state government investment to im -
prove healthcare provision structures in the hospital sector, 
with state governments being required to invest the same 
amount in each case. In view of the principle of dual hos -
pital financing, according to which the costs of treatment 
are borne by the insured persons but investment is to be 
made by the state governments, it seems to be inconsistent 
with the system for members of the statutory health insur -
ance scheme to be called upon to invest in hospital infra -
structure.Deutsche Bundesbank

Federal Government’s Annual Economic Re -
port)  in comparison with those assumptions 
from last autumn is likely to mean a better an -
nual result for the health fund, possibly making 
a withdrawal from the reserve superfluous.
The group of SHI estimators expected the 
health insurance institutions’ total expenditure 
to increase by 4½% in 2018. They attribute the 
acceleration largely to catch- up effects, as the 
impact made on expenditure by some of the 
new benefits already adopted is expected to in -
crease further in 2018. Based on its estimate, 
the Federal Ministry of Health has lowered the 
necessary arithmetical supplementary contribu -tion rate to cover relevant expenditure by 
0.1  percentage point. However, the supple -
mentary contribution rates determined by the 
individual health insurance institutions re -
mained virtually unchanged on average at the 
beginning of the year. This means that the 
health insurance institutions are set to record a 
surplus of €1 billion.
Given the favourable base effects from the 
close of the previous year5 and the fact that 
expenditure growth may once again be over -
stated, the surplus for 2018 may be even 
higher. Furthermore, as the reserves as a whole 
were already at the statutory upper limit at the 
end of 2017 and a number of health insurance 
institutions were probably well in excess of said 
limit, it would be appropriate to cut the supple -
mentary contribution rates, thus providing at 
least temporary relief for contribution payers. 
This is all the more important as the gradual 
implementation of contributions to the statu -
tory health insurance scheme that cover ex -
penditure for persons receiving unemployment 
benefit II,6 which is envisaged under the coali -
tion agreement between the CDU, CSU and 
SPD, is likely to mean considerable additional 
revenue for the health insurance institutions. In 
the coalition agreement, it was also agreed to 
shift back to full joint financing in the future; at 
present, supplementary contributions are paid 
solely by members. The fact that health insur -
ance institutions have thus far largely abstained 
from cutting contribution rates indicates that 
price competition among the institutions is 
underdeveloped.
With regard to the expenditure side, the coali -
tion agreement envisages a number of benefit 
increases, in particular in the area of in- patient 
and out- patient medical care. Together with

structural funds beyond 2019, the focus of the 
new government is on increasing expenditure 
further rather than reining it in. In order to pre -
vent sharp upward pressure on contribution 
rates again in the future, especially in the light 
of demographic trends, it is still advisable to 
seek efficiency improvements in the healthcare 
system.
Public long- term care 
 insurance scheme
The public long- term care insurance scheme re -
corded a deficit of €2½ billion in the core area7 
in 2017 as a whole following a surplus of €1 
billion one year previously. A withdrawal from 
the general reserves was required for financing 
purposes, thus cutting the reserves consider -
ably down to €7 billion. By contrast, the long- 
term care provident fund was topped up by 
just under €1½ billion as planned.
After the contribution rate was raised by 
0.2 percentage point at the beginning of 2017, 
revenue soared by 12½%; however, expend -
iture rose by twice that figure (over 24%). This 
was primarily driven by benefit increases under 
the second Act to Strengthen Long- term Care 
(Zweites Pflegestärkungsgesetz).  Despite more 
favourable macroeconomic growth, which 
meant an additional increase in contribution re -
ceipts, the scheme’s financial balance fell by 
more than was expected when the reform was 
adopted. As was the case when benefits were 
expanded back in 2015, spending pressure can 
be expected to continue to rise even beyond 
the first year as there is a delay before some 
new benefits are fully utilised. The public long- 
term care insurance scheme’s general reserves 
are thus likely to be quickly dissolved and 
– contrary to expectations at the time when 
the reform was adopted – a further contribu -
tion rate rise may be necessary before 2023.Securities markets
Bond market
At €96.2 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in January 2018 was again signifi -
cantly up on the previous month’s figure (€60.6 
billion). Nevertheless, after taking account of 
increased redemptions and changes in issuers’ 
holdings of their own debt securities, the out -
standing volume of domestic bonds fell by €2.3 
billion, following a drop of €18.9 billion in the 
previous month. The outstanding volume of 
foreign debt securities in the German market 
grew by €16.5 billion, which meant that the 
outstanding volume of domestic and foreign 
debt instruments in Germany increased by 
€14.2 billion on balance.
The public sector redeemed bonds totalling 
€4.0 billion net in the reporting month. Central 
government cut its capital market debt by €2.1 
billion on balance. While it primarily redeemed 
ten- year Federal bonds (Bunds) worth €6.4 bil -
lion, it also redeemed Treasury discount paper 
(Bubills) to a lesser extent (€2.0 billion). This 
contrasted with net issuance of two- year Fed -
eral Treasury notes (Schätze) worth €5.6 billion 
and 30-year Bunds worth €2.0 billion. State 
governments redeemed bonds with a net value 
of €1.9 billion.
German credit institutions increased their cap -
ital market debt by €1.2 billion net in January. 
This was mainly attributable to debt securities 
issued by specialised credit institutions (€3.3 
billion) and mortgage Pfandbriefe (€1.6 billion). 
By contrast, other bank debt securities that can 
be structured flexibly and public Pfandbriefe 
were redeemed to the tune of €2.8 billion and 
€1.0 billion net respectively.

lion). On balance, the new issues were almost 
exclusively short- term commercial paper.
Foreign investors were the main purchasers in 
January, adding domestic debt securities with a 
net value of €16.1 billion to their portfolios. The 
Deutsche Bundesbank was a buyer as well – it 
made most of its purchases under the Eurosys -
tem’s expanded asset purchase programme 
(APP), acquiring bonds worth €6.1 billion net. The 
lower value compared with that of previous 
months reflects, amongst other things, the Euro -
system’s reduced purchase volume under the APP 
since the start of the year. Domestic credit institu -
tions expanded their bond portfolios by €1.2 bil -
lion in net terms. This contrasted with net sales by 
domestic non- banks totalling €9.3 billion.
Equity market
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
raised hardly any fresh funds on balance (€0.2 billion) from placing new shares in the German 
equity market. Net issuance of foreign shares in 
Germany totalled €7.5 billion in the same 
period. Domestic non- banks were the main 
buyers, acquiring equities worth €8.1 billion on 
balance. Domestic credit institutions added 
shares totalling €0.9 billion net to their port -
folios, while non- resident investors offloaded 
shares held in Germany worth €1.4 billion net.
Mutual funds
Domestic mutual funds recorded inflows of 
€15.0 billion in January. Specialised funds re -
served for institutional investors were the main 
beneficiaries (€9.0 billion). Of the various asset 
classes, mixed securities funds attracted the 
most investment (€7.4 billion). But equity funds, 
open- end real estate funds and funds of funds 
likewise recorded inflows, which amounted to 
€3.3 billion, €1.5 billion and €1.3 billion re -
spectively. Foreign mutual funds placed shares 
worth €9.8 billion in the German market in 
January. On balance, domestic non- banks were 
virtually the only purchasers of mutual fund 
shares in the reporting month (€23.0 billion). 
Domestic credit institutions and foreign invest -
ors each purchased mutual fund shares worth 
€0.9 billion net.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur -
plus of €22.0 billion in January 2018. The result 
was €6.9 billion down on the level of the previ -
ous month due to the fact that the decline in 
the surplus in the invisible current transactions 
balance, which comprises services as well as 
primary and secondary income, significantly 
outweighed the increase in the trade in goods 
surplus.
In January, the surplus on the goods account 
was €1.1 billion up on the month at €19.6 bil -

of goods, this was, on balance, more than off -
set by the increase in net receipts on merchant -
ing and higher net deductions on imported 
goods.
The surplus on invisible current transactions fell 
by €8.0 billion to €2.4 billion in January, mainly 
owing to deteriorations in the balances of the 
primary income and the services account. Net 
receipts on primary income fell by €4.0 billion 
to €7.6 billion. Much of this was due to the 
normalisation of other income following pay -
ment in December – as is standard practice at 
year’s end – of the bulk of agricultural subsidies 
under the EU budget. Services showed a net 
deficit of €0.4 billion in January after recording 
a surplus of €3.7 billion in December. The main 
reasons for this turnaround were that, after ris -
ing in the previous month, income, especially 
from IT services and various other business ser -
vices, declined more strongly on balance than 
the corresponding expenditure items, whilst 
revenue from personal, cultural and recre -
ational services normalised and travel expend -
iture increased. In the secondary income ac -
count, the deficit narrowed slightly by €0.1 bil -
lion to €4.9 billion.
In January, the international financial markets 
were influenced by the positive economic out -
look and expectations regarding monetary pol -
icy decisions in the major economic areas. 
Against this backdrop, Germany’s cross- border 
portfolio investment generated net capital ex -
ports in the amount of €16.8 billion, compared 
with €32.9 billion in December 2017. Domestic 
investors increased their net purchases of for -
eign securities (€32.5 billion) across all instru -
ments. They purchased foreign bonds in the 
amount of €14.2 billion and money market in -
struments to the tune of €2.2 billion. Domestic 
investors added foreign mutual fund shares 
worth €9.8 billion and shares issued abroad 
worth €6.2 billion to their portfolios. In turn, 
foreign investors bought German securities in 
the amount of €15.7 billion net. Their demand 
focused in particular on German bonds, from

they acquired mutual fund shares, albeit to a 
far lesser extent (€0.9 billion). By contrast, they 
sold domestic money market paper (€16.5 bil -
lion) and shares (€1.4 billion).
Direct investment generated net capital exports 
of €6.4 billion in January compared with €10.7 
billion in December 2017. Domestic enterprises 
supplied their affiliates abroad with funds 
worth €11.4 billion net, mainly by stepping up 
their equity capital (€10.7 billion). They issued 
intra- group loans to a lesser extent (€0.7 bil -
lion), providing mainly financial credit, whilst 
trade credits primarily saw redemptions. Mean -
while, foreign enterprises invested €5.0 billion 
in affiliated enterprises in Germany, providing 
funds mainly via financial credit (€10.9 billion). 
By contrast, they scaled back the volume of 
intra- group trade credits (€6.0 billion). The 
equity capital invested in Germany by foreign 
enterprises remained virtually unchanged on 
balance in January (+€0.1 billion).
Other statistically recorded investment, which 
comprises loans and trade credits (where these do not constitute direct investment), bank de -
posits and other investments, saw net capital 
imports of €17.7 billion in January. Much of this 
was attributable to inflows to monetary finan -
cial institutions (excluding the Bundesbank) 
amounting to €50.8 billion and arising from 
the fact that the deposits of foreign customers 
at German banks grew significantly more 
strongly than their non- securitised claims on 
the foreign sector. General government, too, 
attracted net inflows of funds from abroad 
(€1.1 billion). By contrast, transactions by enter -
prises and households resulted in net capital 
exports (€13.1 billion); these were partly the re -
sult of this sector’s rising claims and falling li -
abilities vis- à- vis non- residents. Bundesbank ac -
counts also recorded outflows of funds (€21.1 
billion) because the deposits held by foreign 
central banks and international institutions at 
the Bundesbank fell at a faster pace than the 
Bundesbank’s foreign claims, which likewise 
decreased. The Bundesbank’s TARGET2 bal -

German balance of payments in 2017
The German economy’s current account surplus declined further to 8% of nominal gross domes -
tic product (GDP) in 2017 in a continuation of the development observed in the previous year 
which has now left the surplus perceptibly short of the record level of 9% seen back in 2015. In 
absolute terms, the surplus came in at €262½ billion, which is well down on the figures for the 
two previous years but still far in excess of the 6% of GDP threshold set by the European Commis -
sion to prevent and correct macroeconomic imbalances. Looking at the sub- accounts, 2017 was 
the first year since 2009 in which the goods trade surplus stopped expanding. This was largely 
down to terms of trade effects relating to the increase in the cost of internationally traded com -
modities as well as the continued strength of domestic demand and the resulting high demand 
for imports. The rosy demand conditions worldwide meant that the slight appreciation of the 
euro on an annual average was almost of no consequence. Viewed in terms of the domestic 
savings  and investment decisions made, last year’s decline in the current account surplus as a 
share of GDP was attributable to the increase in business and household investment activity on 
the back of a strongly expanding German economy.
Germany’s financial account last year was likewise influenced by the recovery in global activity; 
furthermore, the persistently accommodative monetary policy in the euro area contributed to 
cross- border portfolio adjustments. At €275½ billion, net capital exports were slightly up on their 
2016 level. Continued purchases of assets for monetary policy purposes drove down the volume 
of German debt securities held by non- resident investors and led to sustained domestic demand 
for foreign securities. The Eurosystem’s asset purchase operations were likewise the driving force 
behind the further expansion of the Bundesbank’s TARGET2 claims, while commercial banks’ stock 
of external liabilities also picked up. Direct investment flows worldwide receded, but German 
enterprises once again stepped up their direct investment operations. Germany also proved to be 
a popular destination for inbound foreign direct investment. In both directions, euro area coun -
tries were the main partner countries.Deutsche Bundesbank

Current account
Underlying trends in the 
 current account
Germany’s current account surplus declined to 
€262½ billion in 2017, dropping by ½ percent -
age point to 8% of nominal gross domestic 
product (GDP), which is perceptibly lower than 
the record level of 9% seen in 2015. The sur -
plus nonetheless persisted well above the 6% 
of GDP threshold set by the European Commis -
sion to prevent and correct macroeconomic 
imbalances. In the in- depth review that was 
consequently required as part of the 2018 European Semester, the European Commission 
identified Germany as once again having 
macroeconomic imbalances.1
While the current account surplus declined in 
absolute terms, there were contrasting devel -
opments in the individual sub- accounts. Unlike 
in the previous years, the goods account sur -
plus did not increase in 2017. This was largely 
due to the deterioration in the terms of trade, 
which cancelled out the strong increase – in 
volume terms  – in the goods trade balance 
brought about by the vibrant exports growth. 
By contrast, the deficit in the services account 
narrowed slightly. In the primary income ac -
count, the surplus bounced back from its dip 
last year. Given the strong growth in Germany’s 
external assets and liabilities in 2017, yields on 
both assets and liabilities are likely to have con -
tracted further. As for the secondary income 
account, the shortfall was widened distinctly by 
one- off effects on the expenditure side result -
ing from private unilateral transfers to the rest 
of the world.
The world economy’s cyclical recovery in 2017 
created a very favourable global setting for 
German enterprises. The broad regional up -
ward trend was accompanied by more vigor -
ous investment, above all in the advanced 
economies. Furthermore, data from the Inter -
national Monetary Fund (IMF) show that world 
trade accelerated distinctly after last year’s lull. 
Economic activity in Germany, meanwhile, is 
likely to have been dampened slightly by a 
number of price factors, two of which – the 
brighter global economic outlook, and the 
agreement reached by the Organization of the 
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) with 
other major oil- producing countries at the end 
of 2016 to curb the output of crude oil – sent 
the oil price sharply higher.2 A barrel of Brent Current account

crude cost an average of US$54 in 2017 – one- 
quarter more than in the previous year. Head -
winds also came from the stronger euro, the 
nominal effective exchange rate of which 
against the currencies of the euro area’s 38 
most important trading partners (the EER-38 
group) in 2017 was up by an average of around 
2% on the year. The euro gained ground 
against the pound sterling and the Japanese 
yen in particular, but it also appreciated against 
the US dollar and the Swiss franc. These head -
winds slightly worsened the German econo -
my’s price competitiveness.
Goods exports, stimulated by vibrant external 
demand, bounced back from last year’s 
breather to register considerable gains. Imports 
were likewise well up on the previous year, 
partly as a result of the current boom in the 
German economy. Major sources of stimulus 
were the brisk demand for intermediate goods 
to meet the strong upturn in industrial output, 
the pick- up in investment activity as well as 
lively household consumption. With import 
prices returning to a robust growth path in 
2017 for the first time in five years on the back 
of the increase in oil and industrial commodity 
prices, imports outpaced exports in nominal 
terms. The real data, however, show that the 
growth of goods exports outstripped the up -
turn in goods imports. In net terms, the surplus- 
reducing price effect slightly overshadowed the 
positive volume effect, leaving the foreign 
trade balance in the reporting year €4 billion 
down at €244½ billion.
An analysis of the current account surplus from 
a regional perspective reveals that the surplus 
was slightly larger with other euro area coun -
tries and significantly lower with non- euro area 
countries. As a share of nominal GDP , the sur -
plus with non- euro area countries contracted 
by ¾  percentage point to 5½%; with other 
euro area countries it came to just under 2½%. 
The drop in the current account surplus with 
non- euro area countries came as a result of a 
wider deficit in the secondary income account 
and a narrower goods account surplus.Germany’s current account surplus can also be 
seen as the outcome of the investment and 
savings decisions made by the country’s gen -
eral government, households and enterprises. 
Viewed from this particular angle, the decline 
in Germany’s current account surplus as a share 
of GDP in 2017 can be explained by an upturn 
in investment activity spurred by the robust up -
swing in the German economy. This upturn 
was primarily attributable to brisker business 
invest ment and another increase in private resi -
dential investment. Aggregate savings as a per -
centage of GDP , on the other hand, saw little 
change in 2017, even if the individual sectors 
did not always move in the same direction. Net 
general government lending climbed again last 
year on the back of robust activity and low 
interest rates. The strong rise in non-  financial 
corporations’ savings since the beginning of 
the 2000s fell back significantly in 2017, in par -
ticular because the enterprises paid out almost 
all their additional profits and made unusually Goods exports

investment and savings but capital transfers as 
well, receded sharply in the non-  financial cor -
porate sector and recorded a minor gain in the 
general government sector.
Goods flows and balance 
of trade
German foreign trade activity gained significant 
traction in 2017, with exports benefiting as the 
global economic upswing took hold. On bal -
ance, price- adjusted goods exports grew by 
4¼%, after 1¾% in 2016. The pace of this 
growth was faster still in nominal terms due to 
the sign reversal in the path of foreign trade 
prices. Manufacturers abroad reaped consider -
able benefits from the surge in German domes -
tic demand. Additional stimulus for imports 
came from the faster growth of exports which, 
just like machinery and equipment investment, 
have a high import content. Goods imports 
expanded  at much the same robust pace as 
exports   from a price-  adjusted perspective. In 
value terms, imports rose by 8¼%, outpacing 
exports on account of the stronger overall price 
increase recorded above all by energy and 
products at the upstream stages of the produc -
tion process. As a result, the foreign trade sur -plus shrank for the first time since 2009, falling 
by €4 billion to €244½ billion.
Goods exports to EU and non- EU countries in 
2017 improved significantly on the year after a 
distinctly weaker showing one year earlier. As 
far as exports to EU countries are concerned, 
business with the central and east European 
member states outside the euro area fared par -
ticularly well, as they had done in previous 
years. There was also a surge in exports to the 
euro area, partly due to a strengthening of 
growth across the bloc. Exports to all of Ger -
many’s main trading partners picked up 
strongly, with deliveries to the Netherlands 
gaining the most ground. Trade with the 
smaller euro area countries, above all Ireland 
and Finland, generally increased at a robust 
pace as well. By contrast, there was another 
distinct drop in the value of exports to the 
United Kingdom. The substantial appreciation 
of the euro against the pound sterling is also 
likely to have had a dampening effect here. 
Other headwinds for exports to the UK might 
have included the spring increase in motor ve -
hicle tax on new vehicles and its negative im -
pact on car imports.
2017 was the first year in quite some time in 
which the growth of exports to non- EU coun -
tries in value terms was back on track with that 
to the EU. German exports to emerging market 
economies were particularly gratifying. In Rus -
sia, sales of German products bounced back 
markedly after a four- year spell that had mostly 
seen declines. Exports to China likewise made 
exceptionally strong advances as the Chinese 
economy experienced a cyclical upswing. Simi -
larly, there was considerable growth in exports 
to south and east Asian emerging market econ -
omies. Exports to industrial countries outside 
the EU were brisk as well. German firms sub -
stantially boosted their exports to Switzerland 
and Japan. Sales to the United States bounced 
back strongly from last year’s marked lull. The

economies in Asia was below par. Sales to the 
OPEC countries, meanwhile, contracted signifi -
cantly. The multi- year low in oil prices also 
probably curbed these countries’ ability to re -
cycle petrodollars.
German exporters in all economic sectors bene -
fited from the surge in external demand. Sales 
of consumer and intermediate goods shot 
higher, expanding by 8% and 6¾%, respect -
ively, in price-  adjusted terms. And with invest -
ment activity gradually picking up around the 
world, exporters of machinery and equipment 
put last year’s subdued growth behind them to 
record very substantial gains. Tailwinds came 
not just in the form of the strong upswing in 
global industrial activity; the increase in world 
market prices for commodities also buoyed 
spending on machinery and equipment in 
commodity- exporting countries. Manufacturers 
of machinery and equipment considerably in -
creased their exports in price- adjusted terms. 
Exports of computers, electronic and optical 
products as well as electrical equipment like -
wise registered very strong gains. Growth in 
exports  of motor vehicles and motor vehicle 
parts, meanwhile, fell short of the average 
pace of aggregate goods exports – as it had in 
the previous year – and also failed to match the 
rates of increase recorded in 2014 and 2015, 
which were both very successful years for the 
automotive industry. One factor at play here 
was the persistently flat growth of sales in the 
major UK and US export markets, which in 
2016 had each accounted for roughly one-  
eighth of German car exports.
The brisk consumption and investment activity 
in Germany and, indirectly, the growth in ex -
ports as well also made itself felt on a broad 
array of goods imports from abroad. Imports of 
consumer, capital and intermediate goods 
surged at an exceptionally robust pace of more 
than 7% in price-  adjusted terms. Particularly 
strong gains were again registered by foreign 
exporters of pharmaceutical products and of 
motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts. Fur -

The savings of non- fi  nancial corporations in Germany
The high level of savings among Germany’s 
corporate sector has become a topic of 
economic policy debate in recent years. For 
more than a decade now, German non- 
fi  nancial corporations have, as a whole, 
been net lenders. The increase in net lend-
ing by corporations since the turn of the 
millennium has been driven primarily by an 
increase in the formation of savings, while 
there has been only a slight decline in net 
investment relative to gross value added. 
The resulting change in the fi  nancing struc-
ture of non- fi  nancial corporations could im-
pact the transmission of monetary policy.1 
Furthermore, it is suspected that growing 
corporate savings have contributed to the 
current high level of Germany’s current ac-
count surplus, which by defi  nition corres-
ponds to the difference between aggregate 
savings and aggregate investment.2The relative scale of the strong formation of 
savings by German enterprises becomes 
clear when compared with the formation of 
savings by the other domestic sectors and 
by enterprises in the rest of the euro area 
and the European Union (EU). Moreover, a 
breakdown of the components of corpor-
ate savings in the national accounts can in-
dicate which factors were behind enter-
prises’ increased saving efforts in recent 
years.
Contributions by sector to aggregate 
net lending/ net borrowing
Net lending by the German economy to the 
rest of the world has increased sharply since 
the beginning of the last decade. Whereas 
Germany was a net borrower in the period 
1991 to 2000, when net borrowing was 
1¼% of GDP on average, it has been a net 
lender since 2011, with net lending rising to 
over 6% of GDP .3 While the biggest contri-
bution to aggregate net lending in the past 
two decades has, as usual, been made by 
households, their net lending has remained 
virtually unchanged since the start of the 
millennium. The bulk of the increase in ag-
gregate net lending, by contrast, was attrib-
1 See Deutsche Bundesbank, Developments in corpor-
ate fi  nancing in the euro area since the fi  nancial and 
economic crisis, Monthly Report, January 2018, pp 53-
71.
2 Broken down by domestic sector, this can be attrib-
uted to the contributions made by fi  nancial corpor-
ations, non- fi  nancial corporations, households and 
non- profi  t institutions serving households, and general 
government. Net lending/ net borrowing by these sec-
tors, which includes the difference between savings 
and investment as well as capital transfers, refl  ects the 
arithmetic contribution of these sectors to aggregate 
net lending/ net borrowing, which, in turn, approxi-
mately corresponds to the current account balance.
3 Small discrepancies between the current account 
balance, including the capital transfers balance, and 
the net lending/ net borrowing position are attributable 
to the partial use of different statistical sources, varying 
methods of calculation and the fact that the revision 
method applied to the two sets of fi  gures is not 
identical.Net lending/net borrowing in Germany

utable to net lending by non- fi  nancial cor-
porations. The sharp reduction in net bor-
rowing by general government, which gave 
way to net lending in 2014, also contrib-
uted to the currently very high level of ag-
gregate net lending.
Corporate savings in Germany compared  
with other European countries
At the beginning of the last decade, corpor-
ate savings4 in Germany relative to the cor-
porate sector’s gross value added was 
markedly below the average rate in the rest 
of the euro area and the EU.5 While a strong 
upward trend was observed in corporate 
savings in Germany up until 2007, the aver-
age saving rate of non- fi  nancial corpor-
ations in other countries followed a down-
ward trend during this time. As a result, the 
saving rates converged sharply. From the 
end of the 2000s onwards, the saving rates 
of non- fi  nancial corporations in Germany 
and the other countries of the EU and the 
euro area changed more or less uniformly. 
While the upward trend in Germany con-
tinued – except for the interruption during 
the Great Recession of 2008-2009 – there 
was a shift in the saving behaviour of non- 
fi  nancial enterprises in the other countries, 
where net saving increased. It is likely that 
catch- up effects played a role in these 
countries following the period of decline in 
corporate savings prior to the crisis. In Ger-
many, savings of German corporations 
reached their most recent peak in 2015. 
Since then, they have receded somewhat. 
As a result, the average saving rate of enter-
prises in the rest of the euro area, which 
was somewhat lower than in Germany in 
the period after 2010, is now again on a par 
with the rate in Germany.
Components of corporate savings
The upward trend in corporate savings in 
Germany since 1999 (in relation to the cor-
porate sector’s gross value added) is, in this period, primarily attributable to the declin-
ing contribution of employee compensation 
as a share of total expenditure, lower inter-
est costs, and the subdued distribution of 
corporate profi  ts.
The individual factors’ directional impact on 
corporate savings (ie whether they caused 
savings to rise or fall) is not always the same 
in the period before the 2007-2008 fi  nan-
cial crisis as it is in the period thereafter. For 
example, in the period up to 2007, wage 
moderation in Germany led to a clear de-
cline in the contribution of employee com-
pensation to expenditure and thus had a 
positive impact on corporate savings. By 
contrast, the somewhat higher wage 
growth seen since then has dampened cor-
porate savings. Furthermore, the fall since 
2007 in the distributed income of corpor-
4 In the national accounts, corporate sector net sav-
ings are defi  ned as retained earnings after the deduc-
tion of taxes and the addition of net transfers. In the 
case of gross savings, consumption of fi  xed capital is 
also taken into account. The fi  gures presented in this 
box are net fi  gures.
5 For the aggregation of data for the other countries 
in the euro area and the EU, data are weighted accord-
ing to the gross value added of the non- fi  nancial cor-
porations of the respective countries. For reasons of 
consistency, only countries for which data are available 
for the entire period of 1999 to 2016 are included in 
the calculation. Croatia, Cyprus, Hungary, Malta and 
Romania are therefore not taken into account.Net savings of non-financial corporations *

and equipment in Germany sparked a sharp 
upturn in purchases of traditional capital goods, 
such as machinery, from foreign manufactur -
ers. Imports of computers, electronic and op -
tical products likewise picked up strongly. There 
was also a very substantial increase indeed, in 
value terms, in imports of energy products, 
though the bulk of this can be put down to 
price effects – in volume terms, the growth 
was relatively small.
From a regional perspective, there was an 
unusually   robust increase in nominal imports 
from both EU and non- EU countries. As in the 
previous year, the upturn in imports from cen -
tral and east European EU countries outside the 
euro area was relatively strong. Imports from 
the United Kingdom, meanwhile, posted note -
worthy gains, after declining for a number of 
years. Manufacturers in euro area countries 
benefited considerably from Germany’s 
cyclically- induced increasing demand for im -
ports. Price- adjusted growth in imports was not quite as lively as it had been in 2016, but 
this was largely due to the decline posted by 
other transport equipment.4 Disregarding this 
item, the main euro trading partners stepped 
up their deliveries to German customers quite 
substantially, with imports from Spain and the 
Netherlands growing notably on balance. The 
majority of the smaller countries also increased 
their exports to Germany significantly, with the 
exception of Greece. Furthermore, there was a 
surge in imports from countries which are 
major suppliers of energy products, such as 
Russia and the OPEC states, though to a very 
great extent, this increase was driven by higher 
energy product prices. There was another sharp 
upturn in imports from the United States, after 
a weaker showing, and from Switzerland. Broad regional 
growth in 
importsations relative to their gross value added 
has been the main factor behind the in-
crease in corporate savings in Germany in 
this period. By contrast, in the previous 
period, the distributed income of corpor-
ations had a dampening effect on savings as a result of improved corporate profi  tabil-
ity. The contribution of declining interest 
costs, meanwhile, has been greatest in the 
period of expansionary monetary policy 
measures since the start of the fi  nancial cri-
sis.Change in the savings of non-fi  nancial corporations in Germany*

South and east Asian countries, China and 
Japan also saw their exports to Germany climb 
strongly, with the newly industrialised countries 
ranking among the most successful exporters. 
In addition, that region’s emerging market 
economies in particular significantly expanded 
their deliveries to Germany.
Breakdown of invisibles
Germany’s service business with the rest of the 
world usually records a deficit, which amounted 
to €16 billion in 2017. This was €4 billion lower 
than in the previous year. The main reason for 
this was that, against the backdrop of strong 
economic activity around the world, revenues 
from abroad rose more sharply than residents’ 
expenditure on services provided by non-  
residents.
The individual sub- items of the services account 
shifted only moderately compared to 2016. 
Nonetheless, within trade in services, contribu -
tions from business- related sectors and sectors 
oriented to economic activity rose by an above- 
average amount on both the revenue and ex -
penditure sides. In the year under review, the 
traditionally very high sales of German enter -
prises in international transport business saw 
very strong growth in line with the cyclical 
trend. This narrowed the deficit in this sub-  
account, which has been running a deficit for 
many years now, as income grew faster than 
expenditure. Some knowledge-  based services 
also reported disproportionately high growth in 
international trade, which resulted in a slight 
improvement in the sub- accounts in the areas 
of research and development as well as use of 
intellectual property. In the cases of manufac -
turing services as well as technical and other 
services, there was a lack of momentum on the 
revenue side, causing the balances to worsen 
somewhat. As in 2016, cross- border sales in 
professional and management services, which 
saw strong growth a few years ago, rose only 
slightly, notwithstanding a slight reduction in 
the deficit. These services also include commer -cial services, which have recorded a deficit in 
the current account for a long time.
In 2017, service sectors with only indirect links 
to the production sector grew very little or not 
at all compared to the previous year. In the year 
under review, cross- border insurance and fi -
nancial services were less in demand than in 
2016 – from Germany’s perspective, the sur -
pluses generated grew by a small amount. In 
the culture and leisure sector, a one- off effect 
at the end of 2017 led to a surplus instead of 
the slightly negative result that would have 
normally been expected. The largest balance

balance of cross- border travel – rose only mar -
ginally to just under €39 billion. This is due to 
the fact that the expenditure of German resi -
dents abroad rose to a somewhat greater ex -
tent than residents’ revenues from non-  
residents’ travel. On the expenditure side, there 
was marked growth in both expenditure on 
private travel – not least as a result of the large 
increases in residents’ income over the past 
few years – as well as on business travel. This 
particularly benefited Spain, Greece, Austria, 
some east European EU member states as well 
as Asian destinations.
Germany accumulated a surplus of just over 
€67 billion from cross- border primary income 
in 2017. The year- on- year increase of €6½ bil -
lion offset the decline seen in 2016. The bal -
ance sheet is dominated by property incomes, 
which rose to just under €69 billion in net 
terms in 2017. Both higher income as well as 
lower expenditure contributed to the improved 
result. Germany’s net external asset position 
also increased further in the year under review, 
with a positive accumulation effect making an 
impact. This was counteracted by the fact that 
the yield level was again slightly lower overall 
compared to the previous year. In contrast to 
2016, yields on liabilities fell somewhat more 
sharply than yields on assets last year, which 
resulted in a more favourable yield differential for Germany.5 The improved assets and liabil -
ities account was due largely to increased in -
come from direct investment, which, according 
to current data, was not transferred to Ger -
many, but remained abroad. Both the revenue 
and expenditure sides in cross- border portfolio 
investment of residents were down, with net 
income from the German perspective rising sig -
nificantly. On the other hand, the net interest 
income position deteriorated considerably, as 
expenditure was higher and revenue lower 
than in the previous year.
In 2017, the deficit in the balance of cross-  
border secondary income reached a value of 
more than €54 billion, exceeding the €40 bil -
lion deficit of 2016 by a significant margin. This 
increase is attributable to one- off effects from 
private unilateral transfers to the rest of the 
world. Personal transfers to the rest of the 
world – which mainly comprised remittances – 
also increased according to provisional figures. 
The scale of these payments as well as the in -
crease are, however, relatively small. Moreover, 
in comparison to 2016, there were only limited 
movements both in terms of additional private 
income as well as expenditure in the secondary Investment

income account, with hardly any change in the 
balance. Insurance premiums and settlements 
of balances by German reinsurers were pre -
dominant here. By contrast, the balance of 
government current transfers improved, as 
transfers to international institutions without 
direct reciprocation – which include, amongst 
others, contributions to the EU budget – de -
creased slightly. In 2017, transfers from the rest 
of the world to general government remained 
largely unchanged compared to the previous 
year.
Financial transactions
Portfolio investment
At €200 billion in 2017, there were once again 
high net capital exports in portfolio investment 
(2016: €206½ billion). As in the previous year, 
the balance was driven in roughly equal meas -
ure by the strong demand for foreign securities 
from German investors and the decline in Ger -
man securities holdings in foreign portfolios.
In the past year, German investors purchased 
€105 billion worth of foreign securities. This 
was concentrated on mutual fund shares 
(€47½ billion) with broad investment focuses 
that tend to be demanded mainly by institu -
tional investors. Furthermore, German investors 
also purchased foreign shares. At €14 billion, 
the volume of these purchases was, however, 
somewhat lower than in the previous two 
years. This may have had something to do with 
the appreciation of the euro, which had a 
negative impact on returns from investments 
outside of the euro area when converted into 
euro. In the case of mutual fund shares, the 
regional focus was on the euro area, especially 
Luxembourg, where a large proportion of the 
companies that sell funds in Germany are 
based. The regional classification of the ac -
quired mutual fund shares, however, does not 
provide any indication of the investors’ actual 
investment targets. The acquired shares origin -
ated mainly from countries outside of the euro area. The major investment targets were the 
United Kingdom and Japan.
The demand for foreign interest- bearing secur -
ities in 2017 was slightly lower than in the pre -
vious year. German investors acquired €47 bil -
lion of foreign bonds, while they disposed 
of  money market instruments in net terms 
(€3½ billion). As in previous years, German in -
vestors focused on long- term debt securities 
issued outside of the euro area (€43½ billion). 
Once again, bonds from the United States were 
in particular demand. However, at €9 billion,

preceding years, while interest in bonds from Continuing

Japan and China rose sharply. The shift to 
bonds from countries outside of the euro area 
was, however, not accompanied by an add -
itional shift in demand towards foreign cur -
rency bonds. While the proportion of bonds 
denominated in foreign currency was still fairly 
high by historical standards, German investors 
increasingly acquired bonds denominated in 
euro – even outside of the euro area. Given the 
low level of interest rates, it appears that many 
enterprises from non- euro area countries are 
continuing to take the opportunity to issue 
euro- denominated bonds. In the case of money 
market instruments, investors disposed of in -
struments that had been issued in the euro 
area and – to a lesser extent – purchased short- 
dated bonds from outside the euro area in net 
terms.
In the reverse direction, foreign investors made 
net sales of German portfolio assets amounting 
to €95 billion. Non- residents mainly sold public 
sector debt securities, primarily due to the 
Euro system’s expanded asset purchase pro -
gramme (APP). However, at €65½ billion, net 
sales of German government bonds were sig -
nificantly lower than in the previous year (2016: 
€116 billion). The reduction in purchase vol -
umes within the APP in April 2017 is likely to 
have played a role here. Furthermore, a slight 
recovery in the yields of Federal bonds (Bunds) 
was observed.6 Despite positive net issuances, 
non- resident investors also disposed of private 
bonds totalling €5½ billion, which almost ex -
clusively comprised corporate bonds.
In 2017, non- residents purchased German 
money market instruments from private issuers 
totalling €1 billion. In contrast, short- term pub -
lic debt securities were disposed of in large vol -
umes. Sales and redemptions in this respect 
amounted to €21 billion. International invest -
ors disposed of these instruments, especially in

by 5 basis points to 0.3% on average in December 2017.Deutsche Bundesbank

short- term yields on German government 
bonds fell below -0.9% for a time.
It is worth noting that investors from the euro 
area made net sales of German debt securities, 
while investors from outside the euro area in -
creased their holdings.7 This held true both for 
short and longer- term securities as well as for 
debt securities issued by the public sector and 
private issuers. There was again high demand 
from the United Kingdom, which plays an ex -
ceptional role due to London’s status as an 
international financial centre.
There were also net capital exports in the other 
segments of German portfolio investment. 
Foreign  holders sold both German shares 
(€1  billion) as well as investment fund units 
(€3½ billion). As was the case in debt secur -
ities, investors from the euro area reduced their 
exposure, while investors from outside the euro 
area – particularly from the United Kingdom – 
acquired German shares.8
As in the previous two years, German portfolio 
investment was shaped by the Eurosystem’s 
asset purchase programme in 2017, too. In 
addition, the robust state of the global econ -
omy as well as decreasing uncertainty meant 
that investors began to build up something of 
an appetite for risk again. As a direct effect of 
the APP , the Bundesbank’s purchases led to a 
reduction in German external liabilities in the 
form of debt securities, thereby resulting in 
capital exports in this segment. Indirect effects 
arose from portfolio rebalancing by German in -
vestors, who reduced their exposure to domes -
tic fixed- income securities in favour of foreign, 
dividend- bearing portfolio assets.
Financial derivatives, which are aggregated to 
form a single item in the balance of payments, 
recorded net capital exports of €9 billion in 
2017. The balance was therefore significantly 
lower than in the previous year (2016: €32½ bil -
lion). The capital outflows were attributable to 
forward contracts and options trades in roughly 
equal measure. Cross- border forward and futures  contracts relating to electricity and gas, 
which are also recorded under financial deriva -
tives, resulted in net capital imports totalling 
€1½ billion. Monetary financial institutions 
were the main domestic counterparties for 
cross- border financial derivatives.Holdings

7 Regional classifications in portfolio investment should 
always   be interpreted with caution because, on the liabil -
ities side, only direct buyers and sellers of German secur -
ities are recorded. As securities transactions are often pro -
cessed via commercial banks in the international financial 
centres and custodians generally serve as recipients of prin -
cipal payments, the registered capital flows do not always 
reveal the actual change in ownership. However, an evalu -
ation of securities holdings statistics for the first three quar -
ters of 2017 suggests that euro area residents disposed of 
German debt securities over the past year.
8 Due to the lack of information about the actual owners, 
the caveat of limited interpretability also applies to the re -
gional classification of cross- border transactions involving 
shares and mutual fund shares.Deutsche Bundesbank

Determinants of German cross- border portfolio investment
Compared with the current account and 
the fi  nancial account as a whole, the bal-
ances of individual items in the fi  nancial ac-
count are signifi  cantly more volatile, and 
also change their sign frequently over time. 
This is because, in some cases, capital fl  ows 
respond very quickly to changes in (macro)
economic conditions and market partici-
pants’ risk assessments. As a result, it is dif-
fi  cult to identify clear determinants of cap-
ital fl  ows, especially since the impact of in-
dividual factors can vary over time in both 
quantitative and qualitative terms.1 In order 
to nonetheless be in a position to draw 
conclusions about the determinants, this 
box uses an approach which allows the es-
timated parameters to vary over time.
To identify which determinants drive differ-
ent types of capital fl  ow, a model with 
time- varying parameters is estimated using 
the Kalman fi  lter and maximum likelihood.2 
Various net fl  ows yt within the fi  nancial ac-
count are modelled on the basis of the fol-
lowing estimation equation:
yt=X n
i=0βi,txi,t1+✏t, (1)
where xi,t–1, i = 0,1,…,n describes the ex-
ogenous variables specifi  ed in the next sec-
tion, including a constant (x0,t ≡ 1). To miti-
gate the problem of regressor endogeneity, 
the exogenous variables are incorporated 
into the model with a one- period lag.3 Nor-
mal distribution is assumed for the disturb-
ance term: ✏t⇠N(0,σ2
✏). The time vari-
ation of the estimated regression coeffi   -
cients βi,t is the result of a stochastic pro-
cess which is described using the following 
equation:
βi,t = βi,t–1 + µi,t. (2)
The regression coeffi   cients thus each follow 
a random walk process. The disturbance 
term of this process is likewise subject to the normal distribution hypothesis: 
µi,t⇠N(0,2
µ,i); the impact of the con-
stants in the model is not time- variable, 
however. Since the equation for the regres-
sion coeffi   cients (2) is not observable, it is 
determined using the Kalman fi  lter. The 
product βi,t xi,t–1 can then be used to deter-
mine the time- varying explanatory contribu-
tion of the individual variables driving the 
capital fl  ow under consideration. This ap-
proach takes account of the different de-
grees of importance which market partici-
pants attach to the various variables de-
pending on the market environment.
The approach presented here can be used 
to examine the impact of various macro-
economic variables on Germany’s fi  nancial 
account. The endogenous variable yt repre-
sents either the total balance of portfolio 
investment or the balance of debt secur-
ities.4 Ten- year government bond yields, 
economic growth, the change in the risk 
assessment in fi  nancial markets, and the 
change in the nominal effective exchange 
rate are inputted as exogenous variables  
xi,t.5 The literature identifi  es these variables 
1 An overview of the literature on the determinants of 
capital fl  ows can be found, inter alia, in R  Koepke 
(2015), What drives capital fl  ows to emerging markets?

stitute of International Finance, Washington.

found, inter alia, in H Lütkepohl (2006), New introduc-
tion to multiple time series analysis, Heidelberg, 
Springer Verlag, pp 611ff.
3 The results are robust to the use of simultaneous 
 rather than lagged regressors.
4 Portfolio investment is measured as a share of nom-
inal gross domestic product (GDP). Owing to the 
higher volatility of capital exports and imports, the 
model used here does not deliver satisfactory results 
for gross fl  ows. The present analysis is therefore con-
fi  ned to net fl  ows. Similarly, portfolio investment in-
volving shares can only be explained inadequately and 
is omitted here.
5 Economic growth is proxied by the rate of change in 
industrial production. The risk assessment is based on 
the rate of change in the VIX volatility index, while the 
exchange rate variable is based on the nominal effect-
ive exchange rate against seven advanced economies.Deutsche Bundesbank

as important determinants of international 
capital fl  ows.6 The yields and economic 
growth are each calculated as deviations 
from the weighted average of each variable 
for selected advanced economies.7
The above chart presents the determinants 
of Germany’s total balance of portfolio in-
vestment and its balance of debt securities. 
What the two graphs show is that net cap-
ital exports in both categories are driven in 
the fi  rst instance by differences in returns 
and the risk assessment in fi  nancial mar-
kets. The regression coeffi   cients of the 
yields (not depicted here) have the expected 
signifi  cant and negative sign (ie an increase 
in relative yields in Germany is accompanied 
by net capital infl  ows). For the risk measure, 
the sign of the coeffi   cients is undetermined 
a priori. An elevated risk assessment in 
global fi  nancial markets can be accompan-
ied either by infl  ows or outfl  ows of capital, 
which mainly depends on how investors as-
sess the infl  uence of uncertainty on the economies in question.8 This explains the 
multiple changes in sign observed for the 
estimated coeffi   cients, though statistical 
signifi  cance is only reached when the coef-
fi  cients are negative. This last observation 
would suggest that Germany is regarded as 
a safe haven among international investors, 
presumably not least on account of the 
6 For more information, see R Koepke (2015), op cit.
7 These countries are Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the 
United Kingdom and the United States. Gross domes-
tic product fi  gures adjusted for differences in purchas-
ing power are used for weighting. The data are avail-
able on a quarterly basis for the period from the fi  rst 
quarter of 1999 to the fourth quarter of 2017. Data on 
industrial production in the fourth quarter of 2017 are 
only available for Germany and the United States. 
Missing data were estimated using an ARIMA process.
8 Ideally, this approach would include measures de-
picting the risk assessment relative to the other coun-
tries under consideration. It is apparent, however, that 
such measures would not deliver any meaningful re-
sults, given the high level of correlation between do-
mestic risk proxies and a global risk index. Note also 
that the model with time- varying coeffi   cients used 
here, in particular, is already capable of taking account 
of a time- varying risk assessment relative to other 
countries.Determinants of German portfolio investment*

high importance of Federal bonds (Bunds), 
and that safe haven fl  ows played at least a 
temporary role.
Differences in returns led to net capital in-
fl  ows in portfolio investment in Germany 
during the fi  rst fi  ve years of the monetary 
union and between 2007 and 2009. Yields 
were relatively high in Germany compared 
with other industrialised countries in both 
periods. Particularly following the onset of 
the global fi  nancial crisis, when the non- 
standard monetary policy measures con-
ducted in the United States and the United 
Kingdom were exerting pressure on long- 
term interest rates there, Germany recorded 
capital infl  ows in portfolio investment. Since 
2012, yields in Germany have been com-
paratively low, which, viewed in isolation, 
has resulted in capital outfl  ows. The Euro-
system’s expanded asset purchase pro-
gramme, in particular, has been accompan-
ied by a signifi  cant decline in yields in the 
euro area. Consequently, the negative dif-
ferences in returns compared with other in-
dustrialised countries resulted in a further 
signifi  cant increase in German net capital 
exports in portfolio investment.
Changes in the risk assessment in fi  nancial 
markets mainly seem to have a bearing dur-
ing spells of heightened uncertainty. In the 
2007-08 period, when the global fi  nancial 
crisis came to a head, non- resident invest-
ors appear to have viewed Germany as a 
safe haven. The second half of 2009, when 
stability began to return to the global econ-
omy, saw the resurgent confi  dence in global 
fi  nancial markets trigger net capital out-
fl  ows, primarily in the case of debt secur-
ities. At present, there are no signs that 
changes in the risk assessment in global fi  -
nancial markets are exerting a signifi  cant 
infl  uence on German net capital exports, 
and the same was true during the fi  rst eight 
years of monetary union.
Changes in the exchange rate only had a 
bearing on the model during the early years of the monetary union. Currency appreci-
ation in this period was accompanied by 
net capital exports in total portfolio invest-
ment, but tended to be associated with net 
capital imports in the case of debt secur-
ities. During this spell, it seems that the pos-
sibility of generating (quick) exchange rate 
gains was a stronger motive for holders of 
shares than it was for holders of debt secur-
ities. This correlation disappeared in later 
years, however.
Differences in economic growth, mean-
while, played a less prominent role. For Ger-
man net capital exports recorded in port-
folio investment, growth differentials in in-
dustrial production were only of relevance 
during the fi  rst half of the observation 
period. In the estimate for total portfolio in-
vestment, the regression coeffi   cient for 
growth in industrial production during this 
period was signifi  cantly negative, an obser-
vation which is also in line with the ex-
pected sign. By contrast, in the estimate for 
debt securities, demand for which is prob-
ably driven less by growth factors than it is 
for shares, the coeffi   cient proved to be not 
signifi  cantly different from zero.
The strong capital infl  ows observed in the 
fi  rst quarter of 2000 and the fourth quarter 
of 2010 cannot be explained by the model. 
Both of these episodes were characterised 
by special factors. In spring 2000 there was 
a major takeover in the mobile telephony 
sector, which saw portfolio investments 
being reduced in favour of foreign direct in-
vestment. The outfl  ows of debt securities 
recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010, 
meanwhile, can be traced back to the 
newly established resolution agencies, to 
which parts of the foreign business oper-
ations of two German banking groups were 
transferred.9

Direct investment
Despite the buoyant global economy and the 
recovery in global trade, international direct in -
vestment flows in 2017 were once again down 
on the year. This development was mainly at -
tributable to the marked decline in direct in -
vestment in the United States and the United 
Kingdom, which itself resulted from special fac -
tors in both countries. For its part, the United 
States recorded unusually low net inflows from 
offshore financial centres such as Bermuda, or 
from Ireland. The decline may have been 
prompted by the prospect of US tax reforms, 
which were duly given the green light at the 
end of 2017. These reforms envisage consider -
able tax breaks in return for the repatriation of 
American direct investment firms’ retained 
earnings held abroad and the relocation of 
corporate   premises back to the United States. 
The long- term effects of the tax reform on the 
United States’ direct investment relationships 
were not yet foreseeable in the reporting year.9 
By contrast, the year- on- year comparison for 
the United Kingdom was distorted by a num -
ber of large- scale corporate takeovers in 2016, 
which led to an above- average level of direct 
investment activity at the time. Therefore, the 
decline seen in 2017 should not automatically 
be attributed to the United Kingdom’s decision 
to end its membership of the European Union. 
Direct investment in emerging market econ -
omies and developing economies increased 
somewhat in 2017, with countries in Asia and 
South America receiving most of the higher in -
flows. On balance, however, estimates for 2017 
presented by the United Nations Conference 
on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) suggest 
that the volume of global direct investment 
transactions decreased by around 16% to 
US$1.5 trillion in year- on- year terms.International

In contrast to the reduced overall volume of 
direct investment recorded across the advanced 
economies, Germany again exhibited an in -
crease in cross-  border capital links amongst 
affiliated  enterprises. This was expressed in the 
form of intensive foreign direct investment by 
domestic enterprises as well as a strong inflow 
of foreign capital to company offices located in 
Germany.
In 2017, German direct investment saw net 
capital exports amounting to €42 billion (2016: 
€31 billion). This increase was attributable to 
the higher level of German direct investment 
abroad which, at €112 billion, expanded by more than one- third compared with 2016. 
Domestic  companies bolstered their participat -
ing interests in foreign subsidiaries by €71 bil -
lion, partly by means of re- invested earnings, ie 
undistributed profits.10 In net terms, intra- group 
credit transactions entailed the allocation of 
€40½ billion in funds, with a particular focus 
on long- term loans to subsidiaries abroad. 
Trade credits awarded to affiliated companies 
were, on the other hand, mainly short- term in 
nature.
Direct investment relationships, which tend to 
be more long- term in nature, may be driven by 
a variety of motives. The Association of Ger -
man Chambers of Commerce and Industry 
(DIHK) annually surveys its member firms in the 
manufacturing sector concerning the strategic 
objectives they pursue in terms of planned par -
ticipating interests abroad. In 2017, as in previ -
ous years, just under half of all enterprises cited 
the setting up or expansion of sales and cus -
tomer services as their main reason for invest -
ing abroad, followed by focusing on foreign 
production sites in order to access markets 
and, finally, cutting costs.11 It is worth noting 
that the cost factor has gained in importance 
with regard to investing in the euro area. Men -
tioned in 26% of all cases, this aspect was 
more frequently cited as a key motivating fac -
tor for this region than on average for all coun -
tries (24%).
In disaggregated terms, almost all sectors of 
the German economy boosted their equity cap -
ital abroad, with financial and insurance ser -
vices leading the way, closely followed by pro -
viders of professional and technical services. 
Each of these two sectors accounted for almost

man enterprises focused on other EU member 
states and the euro area in particular. Around 
two- thirds of German foreign investment was 
concentrated on euro area countries, with the 
financial centres of Luxembourg and the Neth -
erlands having an especially large impact on 
the regional classification.13 Among the re -
maining EU countries, the United Kingdom 
– despite its upcoming exit from the EU – was 
the main country of destination for German 
direct investment. In the case of the rest of the 
world, the United States and China dominated 
as destinations for German direct investment.
In the past year, foreign investors provided 
their group enterprises domiciled in Germany 
with additional funds totalling €69½ billion. 
This represented a year- on- year increase of 
more than 30% and was significantly above 
the average of the last ten years. The direct in -
vestment funds coming into Germany mainly 
comprised credit transactions, which totalled 
€45½ billion, with financial credit issued by for -
eign subsidiaries to German parents making a 
particular contribution. These reverse flows, 
which had already played a major role in the 
previous year, are often the result of capital 
market transactions involving German enter -
prises’ financing subsidiaries, whereby secur -
ities are issued abroad and the proceeds are 
forwarded to the parent companies in Ger -
many. Alongside this “backwards investment”, 
a notable amount of financial credit was also 
issued to affiliated enterprises. By contrast, 
foreign  parent enterprises tended to provide 
their German subsidiaries with additional funds 
in the form of equity capital, amounting to 
€24 billion in net terms. Here – as in the oppos -
ite direction – reinvested earnings were also of 
significance, contributing almost one third of 
this amount.In recent years, foreign direct investment enter -
prises in Germany consistently focused their 
activities  on distribution, followed by produc -
tion (including research and development), and 
commercial services.14 Disaggregated by do -
mestic economic sector, foreign equity capital 
in the past year (excluding reinvested earnings) 
focused on providers of professional or tech -
nical services, vehicle manufacturers, as well as 
investment in the transport and logistics sector. 
By contrast, a considerable volume of equity 
capital was withdrawn from the finance and 
insurance  sector.
As was the case in the opposite direction, other 
EU countries –  especially euro area partner 
countries – were the primary countries of origin 
of foreign direct investment in Germany. Ger -
man enterprises received high volumes of direct  
investment funds from the Netherlands in par -
ticular. Outside of the EU, the United States 
and Switzerland were major direct investors 
from Germany’s perspective. By contrast, ac -
cording to regional information in the German 
balance of payments, the People’s Republic of 
China, which is regarded in economic policy 
circles as an increasingly key player in corporate 
take overs, reduced its exposure in Germany 
mainly by withdrawing short- term loans. How -
ever, it is also possible that Chinese investors 
participated in the German market via third 
countries.

posits and other assets, resulted in net capital 
exports of €25½ billion in 2017.
The main reason for the outflows of funds was 
the increase in the Bundesbank’s net external 
assets, which grew by €77 billion. The reason 
for this was a further increase in the TARGET2 
claims vis- à- vis the European Central Bank 
(+€152½ billion), which, as was the case in the 
previous year, was ultimately due to the Euro -
system’s asset purchase programme (APP).15 At 
the same time, however, the Bundesbank’s 
liabil ities to non- residents also increased. These 
include fixed- term deposits of non- Eurosystem 
central banks accepted as part of the Bundes -bank’s central bank services, which are then 
invested  in the money market.
Unlike the Bundesbank, the commercial bank -
ing sector recorded inflows of funds (€38½ bil -
lion). First, German banks reduced their de -
posits with monetary financial institutions 
abroad to a greater extent than they provided 
additional loans to foreign non- banks. Second, 
foreign commercial banks –  including those 
domiciled outside of the euro area – increased 
their deposits with credit institutions domiciled 
in Germany. One- off effects arising from the 
asset purchase programme are likely to have 
played a part in this regard, as securities sales 
to the Eurosystem by foreign investors are 
often processed via commercial banks licenced 
in Germany.16
Non- banks also received net inflows of funds 
from abroad over the past year (€12½ billion). 
At €14 billion, net capital imports by enter -
prises and individuals were of particular signifi -
cance here. These were due to additional up -
take of financial credits abroad. Public institu -
tions, by contrast, made net reductions in their 
issuance of cross- border financial credits and 
decreased their deposits with foreign banks. At 
the same time, they also repaid financial credits 
taken out abroad, which resulted in slight cap -
ital exports being recorded (€1 billion).
Reserve assets
As a result of transactions, the Bundesbank’s 
reserve assets fell by €1½ billion in 2017. This 
was mainly due to the reduction in the reserve 
position at the International Monetary Fund.… driven by

The reserve asset holdings are also influenced 
by balance sheet adjustments which, in line 
with internationally agreed accounting stand -
ards, are not recognised in the balance of pay -
ments. The end-  of- year revaluation of the 
reserve  assets at market prices resulted in an additional decline of €7½ billion. This was due 
to the lower price of gold as well as lower valu -
ations of the remaining reserve assets. All in all,

assets fell by €9 billion in 2017, standing at

The demand for euro banknotes  
at the Bundesbank
The volume of euro banknotes in circulation issued by the Bundesbank has continued to grow 
strongly over the past few years. The value of the cumulative net issuance of euro banknotes by 
the Bundesbank went up from €348 billion to €635 billion between late 2009 and the end of 
2017. This means that, since 2010, the Bundesbank has issued euro banknotes with an average 
annual net value of €35.8 billion, corresponding to an annual average rate of growth of 7.8%.
Estimates of how German- issued banknotes in circulation are distributed between banknotes held 
for domestic transaction purposes (domestic transaction balance), domestic hoarding and for -
eign demand (banknotes in circulation abroad) have been shown to be useful for investigating 
banknote issuance in Germany. According to such estimates, in the period since 2010, foreign 
demand for banknotes has played the largest part in the increase in the value of German- issued 
banknotes in circulation. There has also been an increase in domestic hoarding, which, in terms 
of value, is the largest component of the volume of banknotes in circulation in Germany. By con -
trast, the domestic transaction balance remained largely constant in terms of value and explains 
between 5% and 10% of the Bundesbank’s cumulative net issuance of euro banknotes. According 
to new estimates, the domestic transaction balance of €5 banknotes amounts to around €2 bil -
lion, or 23%, the domestic transaction balance of €10 banknotes amounts to €4 billion, or 17%, 
and the domestic transaction balance of €20 banknotes amounts to around €9 billion, or 19%, 
of the net issuance of banknotes by the Bundesbank of each denomination.
In the recent past, there has been a focus on the impact of one- off developments on euro bank -
notes in circulation. Since proposals to discontinue the issuance of €500 banknotes became 
public  knowledge, banknotes of this denomination have been returning to the Bundesbank on a 
significant scale. Economic agents have been replacing at least some of the returned €500 bank -
notes with banknotes of a lower denomination, however. Domestic hoarding is also of interest in 
light of the current low- interest- rate environment. There are no identifiable material changes in 
the estimated increase in domestic hoarding due to the low-  interest-  rate setting. This contrasts 
with the notable growth in the reported cash balances of credit institutions in Germany since 
2016. These show that credit institutions are additionally holding banknotes with a value esti -
mated at more than €10 billion in order to avoid negative rates of interest on deposits at the 
Bundesbank.Deutsche Bundesbank

Euro banknotes in circulation
At the end of January 2002, shortly after the 
introduction of euro cash, the value of euro 
banknotes put into circulation by the Eurosys -
tem totalled €221 billion; at the end of Decem -
ber 2017, the figure was €1,171 billion (see the 
chart below).1 Since the launch of euro bank -
notes and coins, the volume of euro banknotes 
in circulation has been growing more quickly 
than economic output and the monetary ag -
gregate M3 in the euro area.2 The cumulative 
net issuance of euro banknotes by the Bundes -
bank increased at a particularly rapid pace 
compared with total euro banknotes in circula -
tion.3 Between the introduction of euro cash 
and the end of December 2017, the cumulative 
net issuance of euro banknotes by the Bundes -
bank grew from €73 billion to €635 billion. The 
chart below shows that, as a rule, the growth 
rates of the Bundesbank’s cumulative net issu -
ance since the launch of euro cash have been higher than the comparable Eurosystem growth 
rates if the Bundesbank is excluded.
The question arises as to the reasons for this 
strong growth, especially in German- issued 
euro banknotes in circulation. Basically, the in -
terpretation of banknote issuance by national 
central banks in the Eurosystem is made more 
difficult by the fact that euro banknotes in cir -
culation can migrate across national borders. 
Euro banknotes issued by the national central 
bank of one member country of the euro area 
may therefore also be located in another euro 
area country or in a country outside the euro 
area. It is possible to achieve a better under -
standing of banknote use in Germany by break -
ing down Bundesbank- issued banknotes into a 
domestic and a foreign component. As will be 
shown below, Germany is a net exporter of 
euro banknotes both to the rest of the euro 
area and to non- euro area countries. This 
means that the value of banknotes issued by 
the Bundesbank which are in circulation abroad 
(German gross exports) exceeds the value of 
those banknotes which are located in Germany 
and were issued by other Eurosystem central 
banks (German gross imports). Since Germany 
is a net exporter of banknotes, domestic de -
mand for banknotes (banknotes in circulation 
in Germany) is, in mathematical terms, fully 
covered by the Bundesbank. In order to charac -
terise domestic banknote use in greater detail,

informative with regard to developments in the value of

3 The cumulative net issuance of euro banknotes by the 
Bundesbank corresponds to the sum of the Bundesbank’s 
cash outflows less the sum of banknotes paid in. The euro 
banknotes issued by the Bundesbank are occasionally 
described  below as “German” euro banknotes. It should be 
noted in this context that “German” euro banknotes are 
not necessarily located in Germany and that a considerable 
part of them are, in fact, in circulation abroad.Deutsche Bundesbank

ther subdivided into the domestic transaction 
balance and domestic hoarding.4 Earlier studies 
analysed developments in “German” euro 
banknotes in circulation up to the end of 2009. 
The outcome was that the sharp increase in 
German- issued euro banknotes in circulation 
was due chiefly to foreign demand and, to a 
lesser extent, also hoarding in Germany.5
This article follows on from earlier studies and 
analyses developments in the cumulative net 
issuance  of euro banknotes by the Bundesbank 
in the period from 2010 up to the current end.6 
During the observation period of this article, 
this cumulative net issuance rose by an average 
of €35.8 billion annually and thus at a compar -
ably rapid pace as in the period from 2003 to 
2009, when its average annual growth was 
€31.3 billion. Reasons for this continuing sharp 
rise in German- issued euro banknotes in circu -
lation are given by the current estimates of the 
banknote demand components presented 
below. Following the introduction of new euro 
banknotes of the second series (Europa series), 
it is possible for the first time to estimate trans -
action balances by denomination, too.7 The 
presented data are not directly observable in 
most cases and, instead, have to be estimated, 
which is why the results are subject to a degree 
of estimation uncertainty.
Recently, there has also been a focus on the 
impact of one- off developments on euro bank -
notes in circulation. In the wake of the decision 
taken in May 2016 to discontinue the produc -
tion and issuance of €500 banknotes, anomal -
ies arose in the cumulative net issuance of indi -
vidual banknote denominations. These are de -
scribed in the box on pages 45 and 46. Infor -
mation on demand for banknotes in Germany 
in the context of the current low- interest- rate 
environment is provided by the estimated time 
series of domestic hoarding as well as the box 
on pages 43 and 44. For internal analyses, the 
Bundesbank constantly observes the daily time 
series of euro banknotes in circulation with re -
gard to anomalies in order to determine the 
impact of relevant one- off developments at an early stage. A sophisticated procedure is used 
to adjust the daily data for calendar and sea -
sonal effects  to allow a better assessment of 
developments, especially at the current end. 
The box on pages 40 and 41 contains details of 
how the daily time series of banknotes in circu -
lation is seasonally adjusted.
Domestic transaction 
 balance
The domestic transaction balance comprises 
euro cash held by economic agents to settle 
cash payments. The domestic transaction bal -
ance can be approximated by an estimate of 
cash held by households for transaction pur -
poses, an estimate of the cash holdings of retail -
ers as well as by means of the available informa -
tion on cash holdings of the banking industry.8Robust growth

Seasonal adjustment of daily data
When analysing currency in circulation, it is 
often not possible simply to derive new infor-
mation from the unadjusted data. The un-
adjusted data also refl  ect periodically recur-
ring movements which overlap with the 
underlying economic trends and exceptional 
movements. For instance, the annual Christ-
mas trading period causes a signifi  cant in-
crease in the demand for banknotes at the 
end of the year without the existence of any 
potentially crisis- induced hoarding behaviour. 
Only an undershooting or overshooting of 
such periodic movements allows conclusions 
to be drawn about new information captured in the data. The aim of seasonal adjustment is 
to eliminate such regularly recurring intra- year 
movements of similar magnitude, thus mak-
ing it easier to analyse the demand for cash.
German currency is affected by periodic fl  uc-
tuations in essentially three ways (see the ad-
jacent chart). First, besides the signifi  cant 
peaks around the turn of the year (upper sec-
tion of the chart), the enlarged views of pro-
gressively smaller sections in the chart show 
that the volume of currency in circulation rises 
at the end of the month in connection with 
wages, salaries, and other payments (middle 
section of the chart). Second, there are add-
itional peaks at the end of each week when 
more purchases are made for the coming 
weekend and the start of the following week 
(bottom section of the chart).1 There are, 
therefore, not only seasonal fl  uctuations that 
recur annually but also ones which recur on a 
monthly or weekly basis. Third, calendar ef-
fects occur owing to the variable date of 
Easter in March or April. Such effects, too, are 
eliminated as part of seasonal adjustment.2
It follows from these observations that the 
unadjusted fi  gures of daily currency in circula-
tion (Yt) at time t are composed of the trend- 
cycle component (Tt), the seasonal factors of 
the day of the week S(7)
t, day of the month 
S(31)
t and day of the year S(365)
t, as well as 
the impact of moving holidays (Kt) and the 
irregular component  (It):
Yt=Tt+S(7)

t+S(365)
t+Kt+It.

and is identical to the sum of the trend- cycle 
and the irregular component.
The procedures used for the offi   cial seasonal 
adjustment of monthly or quarterly economic 
indicators, such as Census X-12-ARIMA3 which 
is employed by the Bundesbank, cannot be 
used for time series with daily observations. 
STL serves as the basis for an alternative 
method of seasonal adjustment.4 This estab-
lished method is characterised by a high de-
gree of fl  exibility with regard to the periodicity 
of the underlying data. It is essentially based 
on a sequence of local regressions. Each indi-
vidual observation is weighted and regressed 
to all values which lie in a predefi  ned, tem-
poral neighbourhood.
As STL only ever estimates the seasonal factor 
for a single given periodicity, such as S(7)
t, the 
procedure has to be performed completely 
three times in order to capture all the seasonal 
components relevant to daily data. First, the 
seasonal fi  gure of the weekly period is ad-
justed. Calendar adjustment is then performed 
using a RegARIMA model.5 Finally, the effects 
of the day of the month and the day of the 
year are eliminated.
Overall, it is apparent that the increase at the 
end of 2017 was weaker than usual at this 
time of year (see the chart on this page). The 
calendar and seasonally adjusted net issuance 
of banknotes was slightly negative in this 
period.
The peaks in March 2016 and April 2017 iden-
tifi  ed in the unadjusted fi  gures are largely due 
to the usual greater demand for currency in 
connection with the Easter holidays. Accord-
ingly, these peaks are adjusted in the context 
of estimating average calendar effects and 
can now be classifi  ed as not very conspicuous.
Eliminating both periodically recurring intra- 
year effects and systematically calendar- related factors of daily currency in circulation 
makes it possible to focus more strongly on 
identifying new information. Seasonal adjust-
ment is therefore a useful instrument of eco-
nomic analysis which can also be applied to 
time series with daily observations.

I Terpenning (1990), STL: A seasonal- trend decompos-
ition procedure based on Loess, Journal of Offi   cial Stat-
istics, 6 (1), pp 3-73. Initially, the unadjusted fi  gures are 
adjusted for a provisional trend. Subsequently, a sea-
sonal factor is determined for each day of the week, 
month, and year. Finally, a trend is estimated on the 
basis of the adjusted series, which is used in the next 
iteration. These steps are repeated several times and 
supplemented by the identifi  cation of extreme values.

are polynomials of order p and q, and L is the lag op-

Sectoral composition  
of the transaction balance
The estimate of the balances held by house -
holds for transaction purposes is based on the 
study on payment behaviour that is conducted 
regularly by the Bundesbank; those surveyed in 
this study provide information on their cash 
holdings and their usual withdrawal of cash at 
the counter or an ATM.9 This showed that, in 
2016, households held euro banknotes with a 
value of €13.1 billion for payment purposes in 
total. The cash holdings of retailers are calcu -
lated on the basis of assumptions about cash 
inflows from trading and deposits at commer -
cial banks or the Bundesbank and are esti -
mated at €1.8 billion for 2016. The credit insti -
tutions’ cash holdings are recorded statistically 
and stood at €26.0 billion at the end of 2016. 
Overall, it is estimated that domestic transac -
tion balances of banknotes at the end of 2016 
were around €40 billion. Taking into account 
estimation uncertainty, they therefore have a 
share of between 5% and 10% of the value of 
German- issued banknotes in circulation.
The chart on page 47 shows the trajectory of 
the cited components over time. The estimated 
transaction balances of households as well as 
the estimated cash holdings of retailers have 
been roughly constant over time since 2008. 
By contrast, the credit institutions’ cash hold -
ings went up from €19.5 billion in December 
2015 to €26.0 billion in December 2016. This 
increase is likely to be due chiefly to one- off 
monetary policy factors (see the box on 
pages  43 and 44). The total transaction bal -
ance computed here, amounting to around 
€40 billion, is likely to be distorted insofar as 
credit institutions hold part of their cash not for 
transaction purposes but because they want to 
avoid negative rates of interest on deposits at 
the Bundesbank.
Overall, the value of banknotes held in Ger -
many for payment purposes is relatively small 
in comparison with the total value of German- 
issued banknotes in circulation. Euro banknotes used for payment purposes circulate rapidly be -
tween consumers, retailers, credit institutions 
and the branches of the Bundesbank, which 
means that it is not necessary in terms of value 
to hold large stocks to settle cash payments.10 
As the value of the domestic transaction bal -
ance, according to the estimates, remains rela -
tively constantly at a low level, the domestic 
transaction balance accordingly does not make 
a crucial  contribution to explaining the grow -
ing volume of “German” euro banknotes in cir -
culation. What is immediately striking is the un -
changed level of the domestic transaction 
balance even in light of the fact that cashless 
payment methods are gaining in importance 
for the settlement of everyday payments by 
consumers at the point of sale. According to 
the estimates in the Bundesbank’s study on 
payment behaviour, cash payments had a share 
of 74.3% in terms of the number of transac -
tions in 2017, compared with 82.5% in 2008.11 
The percentage of cash payments by turnover 
fell in the same period from 57.9% in 2008 to 
47.6% in 2017. According to the estimates, this 
development is not reflected in a declining cash 
balance held for transaction purposes and 
therefore does not have an impact on bank -
note issuance in Germany either. The declining 
share of payments in cash is evidently being 
offset by rising consumption paid for in cash.Sectoral com -

Banknote holdings by credit institutions
Since 11 June 2014, the interest rate on de-
posits at Eurosystem central banks has been 
in negative territory. 16 March 2016 saw a 
further cut to -0.4% per year. Credit institu-
tions have the option of increasing their 
cash stocks to avoid paying interest on their 
balances held with the central bank. The 
stocks of cash held by credit institutions can 
be inferred from the data which they are 
required to report to the Bundesbank.1 
Credit institutions keep these holdings pri-
marily for the purpose of settling cash pay-
ment transactions. They result from cash 
deposits made at credit institutions or are 
retained by credit institutions to be able to 
supply cash to their customers.
The chart below shows how the cash hold-
ings of credit institutions have developed 
over time. The signifi  cant seasonal fl  uctu-
ations – presumably resulting from trading turnovers – make it more diffi   cult to inter-
pret the reported data. Despite the seasonal 
fl  uctuations it can be seen that the cash 
holdings of credit institutions have been ris-
ing markedly since 2016. Whereas cash 
holdings in 2015 averaged €16.1 billion, 
they totalled an average of €19.8 billion 
and €26.7 billion in 2016 and 2017, respect-
ively. In terms of the annual average, cash 
holdings in 2017 were thus €10.7 billion 
higher than they were in 2015. The year- 
end value of cash holdings in 2017 was 
€32.1 billion – as much as €12.6 billion 
1 The analysis covers credit institutions that fall under 
the defi  nition of an MFI (monetary fi  nancial institu-
tion). All institutions that accept deposits or close sub-
stitutes for deposits from the general public and grant 
loans for their own account are classifi  ed as MFIs. The 
term cash holdings includes all currency holdings, in-
cluding foreign banknotes and coins as well as post-
age stamps and court fee stamps.

Transaction balances of small 
banknote denominations
The introduction of the new Europa series of 
euro banknotes makes it possible for the first 
time to estimate the size of the domestic trans -
action balance by denomination, too. Starting 
in May 2013, the new euro banknotes with im -
proved security features are being issued in 
stages, with the €5 to €50 denominations 
being available so far.12 The chart on page 47 
shows the trajectory over time of the Bundes -
bank’s cumulative net issuances separately for 
old (ES1) and new (ES2) banknotes for the €5, 
€10, €20 and €50 denominations. In the chart 
sections for the €5, €10 and €20 banknotes, 
the cumulative net issuance shows a similar tra -
jectory.13 Following the first issuance of the 
new banknotes, the cumulative net issuance of 
ES1 banknotes dropped off significantly at first, 
but only slowly thereafter. Of all the banknote 
denominations under consideration, a large 
part of the – in mathematical terms – outstand -ing ES1 banknotes has so far not returned to 
the Bundesbank, which reflects the importance 
of hoarding and, in particular, foreign demand 
in explaining the volume of German- issued 
banknotes of these denominations in circula -
tion.14
The estimates of the domestic transaction bal -
ance by denomination are based on this obser -Since May 2013,

As a general rule, credit institutions are 
likely to factor in the opportunity costs of 
holding cash when determining their cash 
balances. It is thus to be expected that, 
when viewed in isolation, cash holdings will 
rise whenever interest rates are low.2 
Against the backdrop of the current low- 
interest- rate environment, credit institutions 
could consequently maintain larger stocks 
of cash for the purpose of settling cash pay-
ment transactions than in times of higher 
interest rates. The particularly striking devel-
opment in cash holdings from mid-2016 
onwards, following the lowering of the de-
posit interest rate to -0.4%, indicates, how-
ever, that the build- up of cash holdings at 
credit institutions in Germany is probably 
the result of a move to avoid the negative rates of interest on deposits at the Bundes-
bank.
Overall, the trajectory of the reported data 
shows that credit institutions in Germany 
are currently holding an additional amount 
of over €10 billion worth of banknotes in 
order to avoid negative interest rates. Since 
mid-2016, the Bundesbank’s branches have 
also been reporting a number of sizeable 
cash orders by credit institutions on a simi-
lar scale.
2 The decision- making problem that credit institutions 
face when determining the number of cash supply 
trips to make between Bundesbank branches, bank 
branches and ATMs – taking due account of cash de-
mand and the opportunity costs associated with hold-
ing cash – is reminiscent of the Baumol- Tobin model, 
which looks at cash balances held for transaction pur-
poses. See W  Baumol (1952), The transactions de-
mand for cash: an inventory theoretic approach, Quar-
terly Journal of Economics, 66 (4), pp 545-556; J Tobin 
(1956), The interest- elasticity of transactions demand 
for cash, Review of Economics and Statistics, 38 (3), 
pp 241-247.
12 The new €100 and €200 banknotes of the second ser -
ies are scheduled to be issued for the first time in the first 
half of 2019. The second series will no longer contain €500 
banknotes.
13 The new €50 banknote was first issued on 4 April 2017. 
At the present point in time, it is not possible to make a 
final assessment as to whether the cumulative net issuance 
of ES1 banknotes of this denomination will behave in a 
way that is comparable to those of the other banknotes 
under consideration.
14 The cumulative net issuance of ES1 banknotes for the 
€5, €10 and €20 denominations by the Eurosystem exclud -
ing the Bundesbank have negative values in each case at 
the present stage. This means that, overall, more ES1 bank -
notes of these denominations have been paid into the Eu -
rosystem excluding the Bundesbank than these central 
banks have paid out in total. This is likely to be due to 
banknote migration from Germany to the other euro area 
countries.Deutsche Bundesbank

The return fl  ow of €500 banknotes
On 4 May 2016, the Governing Council of 
the ECB decided to discontinue the produc-
tion and issuance of the €500 banknote, 
responding to concerns that the denomin-
ation could facilitate illicit activities.1 The 
end of €500 banknote issuance will coin-
cide with the introduction of the new €100 
and €200 banknotes of the second series. 
The €500 banknotes already in circulation 
will remain legal tender and can be ex-
changed at the national central banks of 
the Eurosystem indefi  nitely.
Media reports covering a potential move to 
discontinue the €500 banknote began ap-
pearing in February 2016 and, as the chart 
below shows, €500 banknotes have been 
returning to the Eurosystem on a signifi  cant 
scale in net terms since then. Between Feb-
ruary and December 2016, net issuance of 
€500 banknotes by the Bundesbank stood 
at -€7.6 billion, while issuance by the Euro-
system as a whole amounted to -€36.0 bil-
lion. In 2017, the Bundesbank placed €1.4 
billion net worth of €500 notes into circula-
tion; issuance by the Eurosystem as a whole 
was -€13.2 billion in net terms. The cumula-
tive value of €500 banknotes issued by the 
Bundesbank thus rose slightly in 2017. This 
development – which deviates from that of 
the Eurosystem – is likely to be largely due 
to credit institutions maintaining holdings 
of €500 banknotes in order to avoid nega-
tive interest rates (see the box entitled 
“Banknote holdings by credit institutions” 
on pages  43 and 44). Demand for €500 banknotes from the Bundesbank on the 
part of non- banks is probably declining 
similarly to the demand for €500 banknotes 
from the Eurosystem as a whole.
It is possible that the decision to stop issu-
ing €500 banknotes could reduce the over-
all demand for euro banknotes. A drop in 
the total demand for euro banknotes in the 
wake of the end to issuance might be ex-
pected, for instance, if economic agents 
from both within and outside of the euro 
area were to increasingly hold their fi  nancial 
assets in the form of deposits with credit 
institutions or banknotes in other curren-
cies. The tables on page 46 show the net 
issuance of euro banknotes by the Eurosys-
tem and the Bundesbank across all denom-
inations combined, as well as individually 
for the banknotes with a nominal value of 
€50 and higher, for the period from 2013 to 
2017. Net issuance of €500 banknotes in 
2016 was signifi  cantly lower than in the 
previous years, although economic agents 
swapped at least some of their €500 bank-
notes for banknotes of a lower denomin-
ation. This is shown by the fact that the

Eurosystem’s net issuance of €200 bank-
notes rose to €5.3 billion and its net issu-
ance of €100 banknotes climbed to €28.8 
billion in 2016, while between 2013 and 
2015 net issuance of €200 banknotes and 
€100 banknotes had averaged €1.5 billion 
and €14.6 billion, respectively. The total vol-
ume of euro banknotes in circulation rose 
by €42.8 billion in 2016, following an aver-
age increase of €56.9 billion between 2013 
and 2015. However, it is not possible to tell 
conclusively from this kind of comparison 
whether ceasing the issuance of the €500 
note curbed the growth of euro banknote 
circulation overall in 2016. There are a num-
ber of factors that may conceivably infl  u-
ence developments in euro banknotes in 
circulation, such as the level of interest rates, 
the broader economic backdrop or the ex-
change rate of the euro against the US dol-
lar.2 This is why previous years’ net issuance 
fi  gures cannot serve as a direct indicator of 
what net issuance might hypothetically 
have been were it not for the decision to 
discontinue issuing €500 banknotes.Shifts from euro banknotes to banknotes in 
other currencies are also a possibility. For 
example, cash users within and outside of 
the euro area could increase their demand 
for US$100 banknotes or CHF 1,000 bank-
notes. It is hard to investigate substitutions 
of this kind empirically, not least because 
preferences in terms of cash use are persist-
ent and any changes in behaviour on the 
part of cash users are likely to be evident 
only in the long term. Moreover, banknote 
circulation of a particular currency is infl  u-
enced by many factors and it is not always 
possible to directly identify the precise im-
pact of events such as discontinuing the is-
suance of the €500 banknote. Net issuance 
of US$100 banknotes amounted to US$72.6 
billion in 2016 compared with US$67.7 bil-
lion in 2015 and US$89.8 billion in 2014. At 
CHF 3.0 billion, net issuance of CHF 1,000 
banknotes was lower in 2016 than in 2015 
when it totalled CHF 4.7 billion. These fi  g-
ures do not reveal any clear effect stem-
ming from the end of €500 banknote issu-
ance.

vation. At the time of the initial issuance of the 
new series of banknotes, the total volume of 
ES1 banknotes in circulation of each denomin -
ation was made up of the domestic transaction 
balance, domestic hoarding and banknotes in 
circulation abroad. ES1 banknotes used for 
transaction purposes have a quick circulation 
time and are consequently rapidly replaced by 
ES2 banknotes, whereas hoarded banknotes or 
ES1 banknotes in circulation abroad do not 
flow back to the Bundesbank, or do so only 
slowly, and are therefore only partially replaced 
by ES2 banknotes. In view of these consider -
ations, net returns of ES1 banknotes up to a 
given date are generally attributable to the 
transaction balance, which means that this 
decline  in the cumulative net issuance of ES1 
banknotes up to a given date can be used to 
estimate the domestic transaction balance ac -
counted for by the respective denomination.
In order to operationalise this estimation pro -
cedure, it is necessary to set a time limit as at 
which the bulk of the ES1 banknotes in the do -
mestic transaction balance are assumed to 
have been replaced by ES2 banknotes. The 
launch of the new banknotes was successful 
insofar as economic agents were already pri -
marily using banknotes of the second series for 
payment purposes within a short period of 
time following their introduction. By way of 
illustra tion, the chart on page 48 shows how 
the shares of ES2 banknotes developed over a 
period of 12 months following their initial issu -
ance in relation to the total volume of these 
denominations paid in and out at the Bundes -
bank’s branches. Nine months after the initial 
issuance of the new ES2 banknotes, around 
90% of the €5 banknotes paid in and 95% of 
the €5 banknotes paid out were banknotes 
from the second series. In the case of €10 and 
€20 banknotes, this figure was as high as 
around 95% of the inflows and almost 100% 
of the outflows after this same period. Accord -
ing to these figures, it can be assumed that the

purposes were almost completely replaced 
within the space of nine months.15
The estimation results for the domestic transac -
tion balances of €5, €10 and €20 banknotes on 
the basis of the ES2 introduction are shown in 
the table on page 49.16 For each of the denom -
inations observed, the domestic transaction 
balance accounts for roughly one- fifth or less 
of their total volume in circulation (cumulative 
net issuance). By comparison, according to the 
estimates previously shown, the share of the 
total domestic transaction balance in relation 
to the Bundesbank’s cumulative net issuance is 
between 5% and 10%.
The presented estimates of the breakdown of 
the transaction balance by denomination on 
the basis of the ES2 introduction are confirmed 
by the findings of the study on payment behav -
iour. Based on an estimated value for the do -
mestic transaction balance of around €35 bil -
lion at the end of 2015, the €5 banknote 
accounts   for a 5.2% share, the €10 banknote 
for an 11.6% share and the €20 banknote for a 
24.7% share of the total domestic transaction 
balance. This composition of the domestic 
transaction balance can be compared with the

15 In order to take account of the fact that part of the 
transaction balance still consisted of ES1 banknotes at this 
time, the decline observed up to then in the cumulative net 
issuance of ES1 banknotes is weighed using the inverse of 
the share of ES2 banknotes in gross cash inflows at this 
point in time. See N Bartzsch (2017), Transaction balances 
of small denomination banknotes: findings from the intro -

16 An estimate of the domestic transaction balance’s share 
in €50 notes on the basis of the ES2 introduction is not 
included here, as it is unclear whether the cumulative net 
issuance of the €50 banknotes of the first series has already 
reached a stable level. The €50 banknote is also presum -
ably hoarded to a greater extent in Germany than €5, €10 
and €20 banknotes, which means that a larger share of the 
ES1 banknotes that have made their way back to the Bun -
desbank could also have been the result of people cashing 
in their hoarded cash stocks following the introduction of 
the ES2 banknotes.Deutsche Bundesbank

carried by individuals in Germany.17 According 
to the results of the 2017 study, the share in 
terms of value of the total volume of euro 
banknotes carried by individuals in their wallets 
was broken down as follows: €5 banknotes 
accounted  for 6.2%, €10 banknotes for 13.7% 
and €20 banknotes for 22.9%. The estimate of 
the overall composition of the transaction bal -
ance on the basis of the ES2 introduction there -
fore strongly concurs with the estimate for the 
composition of the cash carried by individuals 
determined as part of the payment behaviour 
study.18
Domestic hoarding
Domestic hoarding includes all stocks of bank -
notes in Germany that have not been covered 
up to now, especially those held as a store of 
value. From a methodological perspective, esti -
mating banknote hoarding is particularly chal -
lenging and the presented results are therefore 
subject to greater uncertainty than the esti -
mates of the domestic transaction balance and 
of German- issued banknotes in circulation 
abroad. The results presented below are based 
on the seasonal method.19 According to the 
esti mates, the stocks of hoarded euro bank -
notes in Germany amounted to €150 billion in 
2016, which, in rounded terms, is equivalent to 
€1,800 per inhabitant. In terms of value, do -
mestic hoarding is thus the most significant 
component of domestic demand. The chart on 
page 50 shows the development of the esti -
mated domestic hoarding stocks over time. 
Domestic  hoarding increased by an estimated 
€50 billion, or an annual average of around €7 
billion, between 2010 and 2016 and thus con -
tributed in part to the increase of €244 billion 
in German- issued euro banknotes in circulation 
observed during this period.
As a result of the low interest rates, the oppor -
tunity costs of holding cash are currently low. 
Since 11 June 2014, deposits held with Eurosys -
tem central banks have been remunerated at a 
negative rate of interest and in some instances, credit institutions in Germany have also been 
imposing negative interest rates on their cus -
tomers’ deposits. Against this backdrop, devel -
opments in euro banknote hoarding are cur -
rently of particular interest because economic 
agents in Germany could, in principle, show a In terms of 
value, domestic 
hoarding is the

ent of domestic 
demand

18 The deposits made at the Bundesbank’s branches can 
be used as a sample of the domestic transaction balance, 
as these result primarily from the use of euro banknotes as 
a means of payment. Measured in terms of the overall 
value, €5 banknotes accounted for 2.3%, €10 banknotes 
for 7.7% and €20 banknotes for 14.6% of the total volume 
of deposited banknotes in 2017. The estimated shares of 
these banknotes in the domestic transaction balance are 
therefore higher than their shares in the deposits made at 
the Bundesbank’s branches. Smaller- denomination bank -
notes are presumably deposited less frequently at the Bun -
desbank’s branches than higher- value banknotes, as they 
are often reused as change.
19 After estimating foreign demand and the domestic 
transaction balance, it would also be possible to calculate 
domestic hoarding as the residual figure. Calculations on 
the basis of the residual figure are problematic, as each 
estimation error that occurs when calculating the other 
components is reflected in the estimate for domestic 
hoarding. For example, the method used for estimating 
banknotes in circulation abroad does not take account of 
banknote flows resulting from migrants or cross- border 
transactions. Estimates of domestic banknote hoarding as a 
residual figure as well as on the basis of the seasonal 
method both come to comparable results at the current 
end, although their trajectories differ over time. For details 
on the seasonal method, see S Sumner (1990), The trans -

greater tendency to use cash as a store of value 
in the current climate. According to the esti -
mates of banknote hoarding using the seasonal 
method, domestic hoarding stocks did in fact 
rise by just over €8 billion in 2015 and by 
around €7 billion in 2016. However, these in -
creases are nothing out of the ordinary when 
compared with the increases in previous years, 
as it is estimated that domestic hoarding stocks 
rose by around €12 billion in 2008, for ex -
ample, the year in which the financial crisis 
escal ated. Furthermore, compared with the non-  
bank sight deposits in the amount of €1,898 
billion at the end of 2016, the calculated stocks 
of hoarded banknotes in the amount of €150 
billion are low. There are therefore no clear in -
dications of any large- scale shifts from deposits 
to cash by non- banks in the context of the low- 
interest- rate environment.
Banknotes in circulation 
abroad
Euro banknotes issued by the Bundesbank can 
migrate to other euro area countries and non- 
euro area countries through various channels. 
Possible channels of international banknote 
migra tion are deliveries of euro banknotes to 
countries outside the euro area by international 
wholesale currency shippers, euro banknotes taken abroad by travellers as well as by foreign 
workers and migrants, and cross-  border pay -
ment transactions settled in cash. Deliveries by 
international wholesale currency shippers and 
cash taken abroad by travellers are recorded 
statistically.20 On the basis of account transac -
tions with international wholesale currency 
shippers, it is possible to determine to what ex -
tent, in net terms, these euro banknotes are in 
circulation outside the euro area. In 2016, these 
net deliveries by international wholesale cur -
rency shippers amounted to -€7 billion, which 
means that there were net return flows to the 
Bundesbank. Based on a household survey on 
foreign travel conducted by the Bundesbank, it 
is possible to determine how much euro cur -
rency has been taken abroad to other euro 
area countries and also to countries outside the 
euro area.21 In 2016, a net amount of €16.5 
billion migrated abroad as a result of foreign 
travel, a net €7.5 billion of which was taken 
outside of the euro area and €9 billion to other 
euro area countries. The cumulative net flows 
since the introduction of the euro currency pro -

issued euro banknotes in circulation abroad.
The results are shown in the chart on page 51. 
Accordingly, Bundesbank-  issued euro bank -
notes with a value of €390 billion were in circu -
lation abroad at the end of 2016, around €270 
billion of which were in countries outside the 
euro area and around €120 billion in other euro 
area countries. This means that around 70% (in 
terms of value) of “German” euro banknotes 
were in circulation abroad, 50  percentage

21 As part of the balance of payments statistics, the Bun -
desbank conducts household surveys on how much euro

abroad. As there are no comparable surveys on euro cash 
inflows generated by foreign travellers to Germany, these 
are estimated based on the assumption that foreign travel -
lers to Germany behave similarly to German travellers 
abroad. The household survey looks at cash carried, though 
this is primarily likely to constitute banknotes. For informa -

points of which were held in countries outside 
the euro area and 20  percentage points in 
other euro area countries. Viewed in relation to 
the period since the introduction of the euro 
currency, the bulk of the growth in the cumula -
tive euro banknote issuance  by the Bundes -
bank is attributable to foreign demand. In the 
years from 2010 to 2016, the demand from 
abroad rose by around an esti mated €165 bil -
lion, which consequently explains the largest 
part of the increase in German- issued euro 
banknotes in circulation during this period. In 
recent years, however, the increase in German- 
issued euro banknotes in circulation abroad has 
tailed off. Whereas this foreign demand rose by 
just under €31 billion in 2014 and by almost 
€19 billion in 2015, the increase only amounted 
to just over €9 billion in 2016. The decrease in 
banknote outflows abroad is due mainly to a 
corresponding decline in the net deliveries from 
wholesale currency shippers, which fell from 
€14 billion in 2014 to just over €2 billion in 
2015 and -€7 billion in 2016.22
Conclusions
Estimates of the components of German- issued 
banknotes in circulation can be used to investi -
gate the determinants of banknote issuance in 
Germany. These estimates show that less than 
10% in terms of the value of euro banknotes 
issued by the Bundesbank is held for domestic 
transaction purposes, over 20% is hoarded do -
mestically and around 70% is in circulation 
abroad. In the period under review, the level of 
the domestic transaction balance has remained 
largely unchanged since 2010, meaning that 
the observed increase in German- issued bank -
notes in circulation can be better explained by 
increases above all in foreign demand as well 
as, to a lesser extent, in domestic hoarding. 
These conclusions confirm earlier findings 
which also stressed the significance of bank -
notes in circulation abroad and domestic hoarding for developments in the circulation of 
German- issued euro banknotes for the period 
from 2002 to 2009.23
In the period since 2010, the volume of euro 
banknotes in circulation issued by the Bundes -
bank has continued to grow strongly on the 
back of strong demand, as have euro bank -
notes in circulation issued by the Eurosystem as 
a whole. This development reflects the popu -
larity of euro banknotes as a means of payment 
and as a store of value both in Germany and 
abroad.Estimating bank -

amounting to €250 million in the case of the €5 banknote, 
€500 million in the case of the €10 banknote and just over 
€3 billion in the case of the €20 banknote. The results also

the German- issued euro banknotes of these denominations

Contingent convertible bonds:  
design, regulation, usefulness
Strengthening banks’ capital base was one of regulatory and supervisory authorities’ central 
objectives following the financial crisis of 2007-08. Contingent convertible bonds (CoCo bonds or 
CoCos) were discussed as a possible instrument with which to achieve this goal. CoCos are bonds 
that are converted into common equity tier 1 capital or written down if contractually specified 
trigger events occur. Under the Basel III rules, they are recognised as regulatory capital under cer -
tain conditions. Investors and the regulatory authorities had expected this instrument both to set 
suitable incentives to improve risk management and monitoring and to increase banks’ total loss 
absorbing capacity under normal business conditions. This would, the logic went, strengthen 
banks’ resilience. Finally, the hybrid nature of CoCo bonds – they include features of both equity 
and debt – was to give them a cost advantage vis- à- vis common equity tier 1 capital.
However, a critical analysis of CoCo bonds, both at the theoretical level and in terms of how they 
are currently employed in practice, makes it clear that this instrument’s high complexity makes it 
difficult to steer the transmission and incentive mechanisms in a targeted manner and increases 
the danger of undesirable side effects. Moreover, given the way in which CoCos are currently 
being designed, banking regulators have doubts about their effectiveness as a loss absorbing 
instrument for banks on a going-concern basis. This consequently raises the question of whether 
the requirements for recognising CoCo bonds as regulatory capital should at least be tightened in 
the short term. In the long term, however, a stronger focus on common equity tier 1 capital looks 
like a better way to strengthen banks’ stability.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
In response to the 2007-08 financial crisis, the 
Squam Lake Group of Anglo-  American econo -
mists in 2009 proposed contingent convertible 
bonds as a possible instrument for strengthen -
ing banks’ capital base.1 These securities are a 
hybrid form of financing and thus combine the 
usual characteristics of debt financing2 with eq -
uity’s ability to absorb losses. The use of such 
instruments is also intended to help create in -
centives for improved risk management and 
monitoring and to strengthen banks’ stability 
overall.
CoCo bonds are subordinated bonds that pay a 
coupon and are either converted into common 
equity tier  1 (CET1) capital or written down 
when contractually specified trigger events 
occur.3 In this manner, they may contribute to 
a quantitative increase in banks’ regulatory 
capital in a way that pure debt capital cannot. 
After the write- down or conversion into com -
mon equity tier 1 capital, banks’ capital base 
will even be strengthened in qualitative terms. 
CoCos differ from traditional convertible de -
bentures in that conversion cannot be trig -
gered by the bondholder; it must take place 
automatically and immediately, ie without 
delay, when the conditions specified in the 
contract are met.
In recent years, CoCo bonds have gained in 
importance  in practice. After a first issuance by 
the UK’s Lloyds Banking Group in November 
2009, CoCo bonds were initially issued mainly in 
Europe. Because they are implicitly mentioned 
in the Basel III rules on regulatory capital, they 
have of late increasingly also been issued out -
side of Europe, especially in Asia.4 According to 
the financial data services Bloomberg and Dea -
logic, by the end of 2017, 398 CoCo bonds had 
been issued in Europe alone (of which EU: 285) 
with a total volume of €230 billion (of which 
EU: €193 billion).5 These numbers can largely be 
attributed to issuance by UK as well as Swiss, 
French and Spanish banks. In Germany, just 17 
issues with a volume of €6.2 billion were regis -tered in the same period (see the chart on 
page 55). One possible explanation for the com -
paratively low issuance volume in Germany is 
the earlier debate on the tax deductibility of 
coupon payments for CoCo bonds, which was 
not permitted until 2014.6 In terms of owner -
ship structure, little detailed data are currently 
available. According to what is known, Euro -
pean CoCo bonds are currently mostly held by 
investors outside the euro area, followed by 
mutual funds mainly located in Ireland and 
Luxem bourg. Banks and insurers, by contrast, 
hardly ever hold CoCo bonds directly, though 
they may be indirectly invested in them via for -
eign central securities depositories, for instance.7
Although CoCo bonds currently make up a 
small percentage of European institutions’ 
regulatory capital, a critical assessment makes 
sense given the current market situation and Additional

2 Specifically, this means a fixed rate of interest, coupon 
payments that are potentially tax deductible, broader 
agreement among the existing equity holders to issue such 
paper in good times and, provided an appropriate design is 
chosen, potentially a lower cost of capital as well as pos -
sibly easier issuance of debt capital given the signalling 
effects  associated with issuing equity capital (see the sec -
tion entitled “Bank- specific implications of CoCo design” 
on pp 57-61).
3 In this context, write- down means that the issuer’s liabil -
ities from the CoCo bond lapse. This generates a profit, 
which increases the issuer’s capital.
4 CoCo bonds have been eligible as regulatory capital 
under Basel III since 2013. Within the EU, eligibility was 
introduced with the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) 
at the beginning of 2014.
5 This does not include bonds for which no information on 
the loss absorbing mechanism (conversion or write- down) 
is available. Based on global data as at 2015, a study by the 
Bank for International Settlements puts total issuance vol -
ume for CoCo bonds at €522 billion from 731 issues. Of 
these issues, 39% were conducted by European banks. See

their regulatory recognition.8 Signs that the 
current issuance practice is having undesirable 
side effects that could have resulted in the mar -
ket turbulence witnessed in the early part of 
2016 raise the question of whether the expect -
ations that banks, investors and regulators 
have placed in CoCos have been met so far. In 
this context, a debate is needed on what role 
the regulatory recognition of CoCo bonds in re -
lation to CET1 capital has for issuance practice 
and whether this regulatory treatment should 
be changed.
Objectives, design and 
 regulatory treatment
According to the relevant literature, banks may 
issue CoCo bonds in order to give themselves an 
additional loss absorbing instrument besides 
existing CET1 capital. In particular, that would 
allow them to increase their loss absorbing cap -
acity even before a crisis occurred, while paying 
a low market price for risk assumption and 
without diluting the owners’ right of control 
from the outset. Because it is assumed to have 
a cost advantage as compared to CET1 capital,9 
using this instrument is intended to help prevent 
banks from having to curtail their activities, es -
pecially lending.10 In addition, the conversion of 
CoCo bonds is to provide additional CET1 cap -
ital if needed. This helps prevent, say, balance-  
sheet deleveraging at short notice, which would 
otherwise be necessary.11 Moreover, through a 
tailored contractual structure, the use of CoCo 
bonds is intended to give banks’ management 
incentives to enhance risk management and 
monitoring. The purpose of this is to lower the 
risks for individual banks and, as a consequence, 
for the banking system as a whole. This could 
reduce the need for government rescue meas -
ures and stabilise the real economy.12
Whether CoCo bonds meet the expectations out -
lined above largely depends on their design. Key 
factors besides the nature of the trigger event 
and its threshold value are the form of loss ab -
sorption and the volume of CoCo bonds issued.In terms of the trigger event, the academic lit -
erature distinguishes between mechanical and 
discretionary triggers. Where the trigger event 
is mechanical, conversion or write- down is trig -
gered automatically once a threshold defined 
either based on market values or on balance 
sheet or regulatory metrics is reached. Market- 
based threshold values can be derived from, 
say, stock prices, sector indices or macroeco -
nomic parameters, while capital ratios and 
measures of the return on equity, for instance, 
can be used as regulatory or balance sheet General

8 For instance, CoCo bonds represent around 10% of UK 
banks’ total capital, but less than 2% of German banks’ 
total capital.
9 The lower costs may result, amongst other things, from 
the potential tax deductibility of coupon payments. How -
ever, this also depends on the design of tax legislation in 
the country in question.
10 There is no consensus in the literature on how capital 
levels impact lending. Studies show, however, that irre -
spective of any potential cost advantage that certain cap -
ital instruments enjoy over others, a strengthened capital 
base alone can have positive effects on bank lending; see

thresholds. The calibration of the threshold 
value determines when the trigger is activated. 
By contrast, discretionary trigger events relate 
to assessments and decisions by third parties, 
such as supervisory or resolution authorities.
Another key feature of CoCo bonds is the loss 
absorption mechanism. It determines whether 
the trigger event prompts conversion or write- 
down, and what this must look like. If conver -
sion into CET1 capital is prescribed, the conver -
sion rate13 determines the dilution of the ori -
ginal equity holders’ claims. Dilution refers to 
the shift in control rights as well as in profit and 
loss distribution. Depending on the conversion 
rate, its impact on the original equity holders 
may differ. Substantial dilution redistributes 
future  claims to profits and losses to the (for -
mer) CoCo bond holders to a considerable ex -
tent. A small degree of dilution leaves these 
claims primarily with the original owners. In the 
context of a CoCo bond issue, the conversion 
rate may be defined as fixed (determined when 
the bonds are issued) or variable (determined 
at the point of conversion based on market 
prices).14 Once effected, a conversion cannot 
be reversed. After a write- down, by contrast, 
“write- ups” are theoretically possible once a 
bank has overcome its crisis. In a write- down, 
the CoCo bond holder suffers direct losses, but 
does not, unlike in a conversion, receive any 
equity. In each of these cases, the contract 
must specify whether a conversion or write-  
down should take place in full or partially and 
what gradations are envisaged in the case of a 
partial conversion or write- down.
In addition to the trigger event and absorption 
mechanism, a number of additional features 
must be specified in the contract. These in -
clude, in particular, the term, issue volume, any 
call options on the issuer’s part and the coupon 
level as well as the possible option to suspend 
or delay the coupon payment.
The design of the CoCo bond contract is up to 
the issuer and is not subject to any special 
regulatory requirements. However, the possibil -ity of having CoCo bonds counted as additional 
tier 1 capital (AT1) or tier 2 capital (T2) gives 
banks an incentive to issue CoCo bonds with 
features that enjoy preferential regulatory treat -
ment. In this way, banking regulators, too, can 
influence the market and thus help ensure that 
the general expectations regarding CoCo bonds 
as outlined above are met.
From a prudential standpoint, CoCo bonds 
must be permanently available to the issuing 
institution to cover losses if they are to be rec -
ognised within the EU as AT1 capital pursuant 
to Article 52 (1) Capital Requirements Regula -
tion (CRR) before their conversion. In this way, 
they are intended primarily as going- concern 
instruments. Specifically, CoCos must, amongst 
other things, be subordinated to T2 capital in -
struments in the event of insolvency. They must 
also have an unlimited maturity, and the terms 
of the contract must contain a threshold value 
for the CET1 ratio of the issuing institution of at 
least 5.125%.15 A conversion or write- down of 
the CoCo bond must therefore take place 
when the CET1 ratio falls below this threshold, 
at the latest. In addition, it must be possible for 
the issuer to unilaterally suspend coupon pay -
ments for an indefinite period and on a non-  
cumulative basis, ie without substitution.16

 eligibility as

13 The conversion rate expresses how many equity stakes 
CoCo bond holders will receive in return for their bonds.
14 Where the conversion rate is variable, a floor and/ or a 
ceiling may additionally be specified.
15 See Article 54 CRR. This figure is calculated as the min -
imum requirement for common equity tier 1 capital plus 
the bottom quartile of the capital conservation buffer 
(4.5% minimum requirement plus 0.625% capital conser -
vation buffer, expressed as a proportion of the total risk 
exposure amount) below which a full moratorium on divi -
dend payments applies to the institution.
16 In addition, Article 437 CRR also stipulates special trans -
parency requirements for own funds for CoCo bonds as 
part of Pillar III reporting. The issuance of additional tier 1 
capital is regularly monitored by the European Banking 
Author ity (EBA); see EBA (2016), EBA report on the moni -
toring of Additional Tier 1 (AT1) instruments of European 
Union (EU) institutions – Second update: FINAL. In add -
ition, the EBA has drawn up standardised clauses for AT1 
issues. These clauses aim to make it easier for smaller insti -
tutions especially to access hybrid capital instruments, and 
to create additional transparency. See EBA, EBA standard -

as a whole are eligible as regulatory AT1 capital 
according to the current definition. The remain -
ing issues include other CoCo bonds with con -
tractually fixed trigger events which may be 
recognised as tier 2 capital (T2) under certain 
circumstances (see the adjacent chart).
Where CoCo bonds do not meet the require -
ments of Article 52 (1) CRR, they may qualify as 
T2 instruments if the conditions set out in Art -
icle 63 CRR are met. In contrast to AT1 eligibil -
ity, this does not require a mechanical trigger 
event. In addition, T2 instruments may have a 
limited maturity, though it must be at least five 
years. There are, however, instances in which 
instruments that are allocated to T2 capital be -
cause of their limited maturity have a mechan -
ical trigger event that could take place before 
that of CoCos eligible as AT1 instruments. That 
said, as CoCo bonds in T2 capital play a fairly 
subordinate role in practice, we will not discuss 
them in any great detail in this article.
Irrespective of the contractually pre- defined 
trigger event, the resolution authorities must 
stipulate conversion or write- down of all AT1 
and T2 instruments if the point of non- viability 
(PONV) was established. This describes the 
point in time as of which an institution is no 
longer viable without a (forced) conversion or 
write- down of all relevant capital instruments.17 
This is the case irrespective of the concrete de -
sign of the instruments in question.
In the event of resolution (gone concern), CoCo 
bonds that have not already been triggered ul -
timately help ensure that losses are absorbed 
by CoCo bond holders through write- down or 
conversion and all senior creditors are therefore 
potentially given preferential treatment. If the 
relevant criteria are met, CoCos can therefore 
be recognised under the Minimum Require -
ment for Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities 
(MREL) or Total Loss Absorbing Capacity 
(TLAC).18 However, unlike other MREL or TLAC- 
eligible instruments, they offer no additional 
advantages in the event of resolution.19Bank- specific implications 
of CoCo design
The many different ways in which CoCo bonds 
can be designed implies a complex system of 
effects and incentives, which harbours the risk 
of undesirable side effects. To be used effect -
ively, then, the trigger and absorption mechan -
ism must be chosen and structured prudently. 
Their complexity also renders it difficult to 
estab lish a liquid market, as investors need to 
be aware of the exact design of each individual 
CoCo.

sions the issuer makes are as follows. Is the

thority? The issuer may also consider whether 
to define multiple trigger events which have to 
occur simultaneously or which can activate loss 
absorption independently of each other.
With regard to accounting value/ regulatory 
triggers, it should be noted that these can be 
imprecise for two reasons. First, the use of dis -
cretionary scope for accounting valuations 
could delay activation of the trigger. Second, 
these metrics normally rely on data that are 
publicly disclosed only on certain reporting 
dates. However, the instrument would have to 
be converted or written down immediately, 
possibly between reporting dates.20 Yet there is 
some question as to whether all issuers are 
able to monitor the relevant triggers in suffi -
ciently good time, which means that timely loss 
absorption is not always ensured.21 Market 
value triggers, by contrast, are more transpar -
ent in principle, giving better assurance of 
timely trigger activation. However, certain mar -
ket value metrics, such as stock prices, are not 
available for all banks. In Europe, for example, 
only around one- third of the banks directly 
supervised by the European Central Bank (ECB) 
are listed on an exchange.22 Market value trig -
gers can also be activated by market move -
ments which do not reflect changes in the fun -
damental values, but instead result from 
changes in market liquidity, for instance. In 
addition, it is also conceivable for speculative 
attacks to activate the trigger.23 Even if the 
contractual threshold is breached for just a 
short time, this is generally enough to trigger 
conversion or write- down. This can occur in 
periods of heavy market turbulence, in particu -
lar. After weighing up the pros and cons, an 
accounting value trigger would appear more 
workable from a banking regulation perspec -
tive. The relevant rules in the EU stipulate that, 
to qualify as AT1 capital, CoCo bonds must be 
pegged to the CET1 ratio.
Mechanical triggers are especially transparent 
and easy to use, as the issuer or CoCo bond 
holder can observe when they are breached, 
without the need for a third- party decision. However, additional information over and 
above the specific trigger cannot be taken into 
account where exclusive use is made of a single 
mechanical trigger. By contrast, discretionary 
triggers permit the use of extensive and com -
plex information, but entail the risk that the 
decision  required to activate the trigger is made 
too early or too late. Activation by supervisors 
may also be taken as a negative signal by mar -
ket participants and could cause negative ex -
ternalities. It is also possible to consider com -
binations of different triggers. For example, it 
would be conceivable to simultaneously com -
bine a mechanical trigger based primarily on 
bank- specific aspects with a discretionary trig -
ger that takes into account the state of the en -
tire banking system.24
The CoCo bonds issued in the EU to date have 
predominantly had a single mechanical trigger. 
All of them use a CET1 capital ratio as a bank- 
specific regulatory threshold, with conversion 
or write- down automatically triggered when 
capital falls below that level.25 For CoCo bonds 
that qualify as AT1 or T2 instruments, regula -
tors in the EU generally also have the power to 
intervene and force conversion or write- down 
if the PONV is identified. Market value triggers 
play no role for CoCos issued in the EU, nor is 
there currently any evidence of combined trig -
ger events (eg allowing systemic components 
to be taken into account), which have to occur Accounting

simultaneously. This principally reflects the pru -
dential requirements for CoCos to be recog -
nised as AT1 capital in the EU.
The other factor that is crucial to a CoCo 
bond’s effect, besides the trigger, is the thresh -
old which activates conversion or write- down. 
In order for a CoCo to effectively become avail -
able for loss absorption and thus ensure the 
issuer  remains a going concern, the threshold 
should be defined such that timely activation 
can be assured.26 This is the case if the positive 
effects of loss absorption at least compensate 
for potential side effects such as unwanted sig -
nalling effects. A threshold that triggers con -
version or write- down very early on can send a 
negative signal at an especially early stage, thus 
eliciting inappropriate market reactions. Share -
holders of listed banks could offload their 
equity instruments to pre- empt the trigger. Any 
slump in stock market prices that this might 
potentially cause would thus be driven by low 
market liquid ity, herd behaviour, a lack of trans -
parency and information asymmetries, and 
could overstate the actual decrease in the 
underlying enter prise value of the bank con -
cerned.27 Conversely, a CoCo bond with a 
threshold that triggers conversion or write-  
down at a very late stage fails to serve the 
desired  purpose, which is to function as a loss 
absorbing instrument on a going- concern 
basis.
Roughly 44% of the total issue volume of CoCo 
bonds in the EU since 2009 have a CET1 ratio 
of 5.125% as their threshold. This corresponds 
to the minimum level required to qualify as AT1 
capital in the EU. Looking at this threshold in 
relation to the overall prudential CET1 capital 
requirements –  including the buffer require -
ments and, where applicable, the Pillar II re -
quirements  – it is questionable whether the 
CoCo bonds issued in the EU thus far are actu -
ally able to perform their function as a loss ab -
sorbing instrument on a going- concern basis. 
As things currently stand, it is possible for these 
overall requirements to be undershot or for the 
PONV to be identified by the resolution and supervisory authorities prior to the contractual 
trigger event even occurring. CoCos would 
then only really come into play in the event of 
a bank failure and would no longer serve the 
purpose of absorbing losses on a going- concern 
basis. For this reason, it would be worth con -
sidering raising the regulatory requirement for 
the threshold for AT1-eligible CoCos.
The regulatory requirements for AT1-eligible 
CoCos allow for both conversion into CET1 
capital and permanent or temporary write-  
down as loss absorption mechanisms. 
Conversion- to- equity (CE) CoCo bonds set 
incen tives for equity holders and the bank’s 
management to strengthen risk management 
and monitoring when they entail sufficiently 
substantial dilution.28 This is the case when 
rights of control over, but also of participation 
in, future profits and losses are transferred on a 
large scale to the former CoCo bond holders. 
This then sets an incentive for the original 
equity holders to avoid conversion and to make 
additional CET1 capital available ahead of time, 
for example.29 Similarly to a threshold that acti -
vates loss absorption very early on, however, 
substantial dilu tion can also prompt existing 
stakeholders to sell their stock early and thus 
cause a price drop.30 Principal write- down 
(PWD) CoCo bonds flip this incentive structure. 
They give equity holders and the bank’s man -
agement incentives to take on greater risk, be -
cause when the trigger event occurs the con -
trol and participation rights remain unchanged, 
but a portion of the losses are borne by the Threshold

CoCo bond holders.31 In terms of incentives, 
then, the literature favours CoCo bonds with a 
conversion mechanism over those that are 
written down. However, this form of bond is 
only available to corporations. Other legal 
structures, such as cooperatives, can only issue 
PWD CoCos. It would thus appear logical to 
give regulatory approval for both mechanisms.
One possible way to explain why the EU has 
largely seen issuance of CoCo bonds with a 
PWD loss absorption mechanism is that it is 
ultim ately the holders of bank equity that 
decide  on CoCo issuance.32 By the end of 2017, 
PWD CoCos made up 48% of the total issue 
volume of CoCo bonds (see the above chart). 
This decision- making power of the banks’ 
equity holders could also explain why, though 
not the desired outcome from a regulatory per -
spective, CE CoCo bonds almost exclusively in -
volve a small degree of dilution of the original 
equity holders’ stakes. As a result, the future 
control and profit participation rights of the ori -
ginal equity holders are barely affected by the 
trigger event occurring.33 The current design of 
CoCo bonds thus tends to set perverse incen -
tives, leading banks to take on greater risk. 
From a regulatory perspective, therefore, the 
aim should be for substantial dilution, thus set -
ting incentives for the original equity holders to 
ensure sustainable risk provisioning.In order for CoCo bonds to effectively perform 
their loss absorption function, the issue vol -
ume, which is converted or written down when 
the trigger event occurs, has to be large enough 
relative to a bank’s total capitalisation.34 Look -
ing at banks’ overall funding structure, the lit -
erature also advocates using CoCo bonds not 
as a substitute for, but in addition to, available 
equity capital.35 This aligns with the original 
object ives of the Basel III framework, which 
focuses  on increasing and improving the qual -
ity of regulatory own funds and thus primarily 
on strengthening CET1 capital.36 Accordingly, 
AT1 instruments such as CoCo bonds should 
only be used in addition to available CET1 cap -
ital.
Although the volume of CoCo bonds issued in 
the EU has risen significantly since 2009, it has 
so far remained at a relatively low level. CoCo 
issuers tend to be larger, well- capitalised 
banks.37 On the one hand, it therefore seems 
unclear whether CoCo bonds are an effective 
instrument for loss absorption in their current 
design, but on the other hand, this may not be 
necessary provided banks hold sufficient CET1 
capital. In light of this, there is, in principle, no 
need for higher volumes of CoCos from a regu -
latory perspective. Instead, it would seem more 
expedient to maintain the focus on strengthen -Current loss

ing CET1 capital, partly because market de -
mand for CoCos could be low.
There are primarily three identifiable reasons 
for issuing CoCo bonds. Their potential to qual -
ify as regulatory capital, especially as AT1 cap -
ital, has already been discussed as a first incen -
tive for their use. A second motive relates to 
the coupon payments being tax deductible, as 
against equity capital.38 Whether or not the 
coupons are tax deductible depends on the 
applicable  national tax law. Generally, the 
actual  CoCo design has to emphasise its debt- 
like nature, thus clearly delineating it from 
equity instruments. This can be achieved, for 
instance, by defining a threshold which would 
see the trigger activated at a comparatively late 
stage. This results in a trade- off between regu -
latory and tax- related considerations in the de -
sign of CoCo bonds. From a regulatory per -
spective, the tax treatment creates a perverse 
incentive for the threshold to be set as low as 
possible.39 In terms of eligibility as AT1 capital, 
European regulators should give this problem 
due consideration. In this context, the current 
CET1 ratio of 5.125% seems too low and 
should be raised.
The third motive for issuance discussed in the 
literature is whether CoCo bonds generate 
lower costs for banks than CET1 capital.40 Be-
sides their preferential tax treatment, one pos -
sible reason for such cost advantages is that, 
until the trigger event occurs or the coupon 
payment is suspended, the equity holders alone 
bear the bank’s losses. However, it is uncertain 
whether this cost advantage over CET1 capital 
actually exists. CoCo bonds make their holders 
senior participants in the bank’s losses, but cap 
their participation in its profits through a fixed 
coupon. This has to be offset by higher cou -
pons compared to senior debt. Even factoring 
in low market liquidity, it is at least conceivable 
that CoCo bonds could generate higher costs 
for banks than CET1 capital. Analyses of banks 
indicate that there are indeed price premiums 
of this sort compared with equity in the mar -
ket.41Impact across banks
Whether or not the potential effect of individ -
ual banks seeing an improvement in their loss 
absorbing capacity can spill over to the banking 
system as a whole also depends on the possi -
bility of undesirable side effects of the use of 
CoCo bonds across banks occurring. The afore -
mentioned complexity of CoCo bonds not only 
affects the universe and behaviour of issuers 
and holders but also increases the risk that the 
instrument is not fit for purpose and therefore 
ultimately fails to achieve its intended effect. 
Thus, for instance, the trigger could be mis -
timed, impairing loss absorbing capacity. In 
addition, the increased issuance of CoCo bonds 
with a write- down mechanism could impair the 
incentive to manage and monitor risk.42 Even in 
the absence of such design flaws, CoCo bonds 
could transmit bank- specific risks to other 
banks and financial market agents (eg insurers, 
mutual funds and hedge funds).43 There are 
two transmission channels. One is that CoCos 
can create additional linkages among banks.44 
The other is that information- based contagion 
effects could occur.45
Additional linkages of issuers with banks and 
other financial agents can give rise to undesir -
able effects in a variety of ways. As regards 
CoCo bonds with a write- down mechanism, 
holders take an immediate hit if the trigger 
event occurs. Once the final write- down has 
occurred, CoCo bond holders relinquish their Trade- off

claim to a coupon payment and especially to 
the face value of the CoCo bond. These losses 
eat into the holders’ balance sheet capital, 
thereby impairing additional loss absorbing 
capacity. In the case of conversion, however, 
linkages through debt can create linkages 
through equity, thereby involving the new 
owners directly in the issuer’s entrepreneurial 
risk. If the new owners are subject to stricter 
investment restrictions here than in the case of 
CoCos,46 the equity instruments created in this 
manner would have to be sold. That could trig -
ger price volatility in the equity markets. These 
linkages could pose a problem in both designs 
in those cases where banks hold each other’s 
CoCo bonds,47 potentially impairing the loss 
absorbing capacity of all institutions involved.48
The occurrence of the trigger event or suspen -
sion by a bank of coupon payments can also 
lead to information- based contagion effects. 
Owing to similar risks and performance pat -
terns of various banks’ investments, these 
banks can suffer simultaneous losses. Holders 
of CoCo bonds could therefore see the occur -
rence of a trigger event at another bank as a 
negative signal and fear a triggering of their 
CoCos. The more highly correlated the risks 
and performance patterns of the banks in -
volved are, the stronger this effect is. These 
CoCo bond holders could respond by offload -
ing their holdings, which would generally put 
pressure on prices in the CoCo bond market.49 
Such signals could, by the same token, create 
interactions with other markets. The sell- off 
stimulus from the CoCo market could, for in -
stance, spill over to other debt, ultimately trig -
gering a bank run. Equity instruments could 
additionally come under pressure. That has the 
potential to create a conflict between bank-  
specific and interbank effects of CoCo bonds: 
triggering a bank’s CoCo bonds can increase 
that institution’s individual loss absorbing cap -
acity, while at the same time having the afore -
mentioned adverse side effects on other banks.
In addition to the specific design of the bond, 
the holder structure is another factor which is decisive as to whether the use of CoCo bonds 
can bring about undesirable effects. The rele -
vance of information-  based contagion effects is 
illustrated by the market turmoil caused in early 
2016 by fears that one individual bank could sus -
pend its coupon payments. What this observa -
tion also shows is that this type of instrument is 
not a suitable investment instrument for all po -
tential holders. In principle, the relatively high 
potential yields that CoCo bonds appear, at first 
glance, to offer compared to conventional bank 
bonds lend them (especially in the current low-  
interest- rate environment) a certain attraction as 
a capital investment. Owing to their major scope 
for discretion in their design features, CoCos are, 
however, highly complex and opaque instru -
ments. They are fraught with numerous  risks 
(such as losses caused by write- downs or conver -
sion, or coupon cancellation), making them diffi -
cult to price. The European Securities and Mar -
kets Authority (ESMA)50 and the German Federal 
Financial Supervisory Author ity (BaFin)51 there -

of these instruments for private investors. In -Information-

deed, the sale of these products to retail invest -
ors is prohibited in the United Kingdom.52 By 
contrast, banks and other institutional investors, 
such as insurance companies and mutual funds, 
fundamentally appear to be a more plausible 
group of investors in CoCo bonds.53 Owing to 
their business activities, these entities should 
possess sufficient risk assessment and portfolio 
diversification capacity. This should put them in a 
better position to adequately understand CoCo 
bonds and how they work and to act accord -
ingly. Nonetheless, even institutional investors 
seem to find it difficult to price these bonds.54 
Owing in particular to potential interaction 
caused by mutual equity holdings between 
banks, these seem, among institutional investors, 
to be the least suited to holding CoCo bonds.
The present level of usage and the current 
holder structure do not indicate a material haz -
ard posed by undesirable interbank side effects 
of the use of CoCo bonds. As described above, 
European CoCo bonds are held mostly by non- 
euro area investors and European mutual 
funds. Banks and insurers are virtually irrelevant 
as direct holders of CoCo bonds.55 Owing to 
the insufficient availability of data, it is currently 
impossible to tell whether or not they may be 
holding CoCos indirectly, such as through for -
eign central securities depositories (CSDs). In 
addition, the holder structure can vary consid -
erably by region and on a case-by-case basis, 
and is also subject to considerable change over 
time. Against this background, it would appear 
appropriate for supervisory authorities to moni -
tor trends in the CoCo bond market more 
closely in order to identify, in a timely manner, 
potential undesirable effects, both for individ -
ual banks as well as across banks.
Conclusion
Following on from the 2007-08 financial crisis, 
policymakers, regulators and academic re -
searchers all called for a strengthening of the 
quantity and quality of bank capital. This was 
to ensure that banks held sufficient loss ab -sorbing capital in order to continue as a going 
concern, while at the same time enhancing 
banks’ stability. In the meantime, banks have 
made major strides in increasing their capital 
ratios, both by accumulating additional CET1 
capital and by reducing their risk- weighted 
assets.
CoCo bonds, a form of hybrid capital instru -
ment, can be recognised under certain condi -
tions as regulatory AT1 or T2 capital. The spe -
cific design of these highly complex instruments 
is what ultimately determines whether CoCo 
bonds will be able to meet expectations.
The actual design of CoCo bonds gives rise to 
doubts about their effectiveness for banks as a 
loss absorbing instrument on a going- concern 
basis. It is particularly the low CET1 thresholds 
seen in practice, below which a conversion or 
write- down is triggered, which could temper 
the effectiveness of this instrument. Regulatory 
capital requirements could be undershot even 
before the occurrence of the trigger events 
enshrined  in the CoCo bond contracts. This 
would require authorities to intervene in banks’ 
business operations even prior to the contract -
ual conversion or write- down of CoCos. In 
order to address this issue, the regulatory 
require ments governing AT1 instruments in the 
EU should be tightened.56 In particular, it 
should be examined how much the mechanical 
CET1 threshold has to be raised in order to Current holder

ations. The extent to which, as intended, in -
centives for banks to improve risk management 
and monitoring are being set appears question -
able. Banks’ management could have an incen -
tive to take even more risk, in fact. This is to be 
feared with regard to CoCo bonds with both a 
write- down mechanism and conversion with a 
small degree of dilution.
Moreover, CoCo bonds could also trigger un -
desirable effects across banks. One key reason 
is additional linkages within the banking sector 
and between banks and other institutional in -
vestors, which could be created by the holding 
of CoCo bonds. According to available, albeit 
patchy information, this cannot yet be empiric -
ally confirmed for the EU. Another key reason is 
the possibility of information- based contagion, 
which can appear in particular where similar 
risks and performance patterns of the assets 
held by individual issuers exist. If a trigger event 
occurs with one issuer, this can be understood 
as a negative signal for other banks in the 
CoCo bond market and beyond. It is conse -
quently conceivable that individual banks’ at -
tempt to increase their loss absorbing capital 
by issuing CoCo bonds could unleash undesir -
able effects across banks, all the more if the high issue volumes cited in the relevant litera -
ture as essential to the effective use of CoCo 
bonds are actually achieved.
On the whole, the assumed advantages of 
CoCo bonds over CET1 capital are dubious. It is 
unclear, for instance, whether the cost advan -
tage of CoCos over CET1 capital discussed in 
the literature truly exists. Bearing in mind the 
highly complex nature, and the risks, of CoCo 
bonds, if correctly valued they could even be 
more expensive for the issuer than CET1 capital 
despite the tax advantage. At all events, any 
cost advantage of CoCo bonds resulting purely 
from preferential tax treatment compared to 
CET1 capital and from preferential regulatory 
treatment compared to straight debt is not suf -
ficient justification for their use. From a regula -
tory point of view, the primary benefit of using 
CoCos derives from their ability to absorb 
losses. As they are currently being imple -
mented, with low CET1 thresholds for con-
version or write- down, this is probably not 
assured . Therefore, regulatory incentives to use 
CoCo bonds should be examined critically and, 
in future, be geared more closely to their in -
tended effects. Given the complexity and the 
possibility of adverse side effects across banks, 
however, regulatory incentives to use CoCo 
bonds do not appear appropriate at present. 
Instead, focusing on CET1 capital is likely to be 
the more expedient approach in the long term 
to safeguarding and improving the stability of 
banks.Deutsche Bundesbank
