Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The German economy is likely to have recorded 
very strong growth in the first quarter of 2014. 
One main reason for this was industry stepping 
up its output substantially after the surge in 
orders in the fourth quarter of 2013. Added to 
this, the construction industry, in particular, 
benefited from the exceptionally mild winter 
weather. The cyclical momentum of the Ger -
man economy is also reflected in the acceler -
ated growth in imports and the marked rise in 
employment.
Following the extremely strong start to the 
year, economic growth in Germany is likely to 
ease perceptibly in the second quarter. In line 
with the expectation indicators, growth in in -
dustrial orders in the first two months of 2014 
did not continue with the same intensity and 
the positive effect of the weather in the first 
quarter will depress the GDP growth rate in the 
second quarter. Given the exceptionally favour -
able consumer climate and buoyant demand 
for housing construction, however, the under -
lying cyclical trend is likely to go on pointing 
clearly upwards, especially in terms of domestic 
activity.
Industry
Industrial output in February was up by a sea-
sonally adjusted ½% compared with January. 
The figure for both months taken together 
clearly exceeded the average of the final quar -
ter of 2013 by 1½%. The production of capital 
goods grew particularly strongly by 2%. Inter -
mediate goods also saw marked growth of 
1½%, whereas the output of consumer goods expanded only marginally by ¼%.Orders received by German industry picked up perceptibly in February, going up by a season -
ally adjusted ¾% on the month. On an average 
of January and February, new orders were also 
up ¾% on the fourth quarter of 2013. Clear 
demand impulses were recorded both domes -
tically (+2%) and from non-  eur o-  ar ea countries 
(+1¼%). By contrast, orders from euro-  ar ea 
countries decreased by 2¾%. This was due pri -
marily to a weaker inflow of ad hoc orders 
from the aircraft and aerospace industry. The 
total volume of orders for capital goods went 
up by ¾%. Motor vehicles and motor vehicle 
parts were in particularly strong demand, espe -
cially for export. Intermediate goods orders 
went up slightly by ¼% as a result of the sharp 
rise in domestic demand. Consumer goods 
orders went up significantly by 2¼%, with 
pharmaceutical products playing a large part in 
this.
Industrial turnover in February was down by a 
seasonally adjusted 1¼% on the very high level 
of January. On an average of January and Feb -
ruary taken together, turnover from both do -
mestic and foreign sales was up 1¾% on the 
final quarter of 2013. Growth in exports was 
due chiefly to a 3¼% rise in sales to non-  eur o-  
area countries. Sales to other euro-  ar ea coun -
tries fell by just under ¼% on the quarter. The 
value of exports of goods in February fell by a 
seasonally adjusted 1¼% on the month. Never -
theless, the average for both months taken 
 together was 1% up on the final quarter of 
2013. The value of imports in February rose 
½% on the month. This means that the previ -
ous quarter’s level has been clearly exceeded 
by 3% on average since the beginning of the 
year, despite declining import prices.

strongly elevated January level. On an average 
of these two months, construction output rose 
substantially by 6% compared with the final 
quarter of 2013. At 6¼%, the increase in the 
main construction industry was only marginally stronger than in the finishing trades (5¾%). In 
the first two months of the year, new orders in 
the main construction sector were up signifi -
cantly on the fourth quarter of 2013 in season -
ally adjusted terms. Housing construction 
orders rose particularly strongly.
Labour market
The pick-  up in economic activity and the fa -
vourable weather conditions continued to have 
a positive impact on the labour market. In Feb -
ruary, the seasonally adjusted number of per -
sons in work in Germany rose by 48,000 on 
the month. The increase in the first two months 
of this year was therefore greater than in the 
previous months. As a result, the year-  on-  year 
rate rose to 314,000 persons, or 0.8%. Accord-
ing to estimates by the Federal Employment 
Agency, employment subject to social security 
contributions showed a very sharp month-  on- 
month increase of 67,000 in January, compared 
with 37,000 in December. The year-  on-  year rise 
amounted to 414,000 persons, or 1.4%. Ac -
cording to the Ifo employment barometer, the 
willingness of enterprises to recruit new staff 
declined somewhat in March compared with 
the previous month, whereas the Federal Em -
ployment Agency’s BA-  X job index incr eased 
slightly in seasonally adjusted terms.
In March, the number of persons registered as 
unemployed showed a further slight decline, 
this time by 12,000. The unemployment rate 
was unchanged at 6.7%. Unemployment was 
down by 43,000 persons compared with the previous year. Underemployment (excluding 
short-  t ime work) also declined. According to 
the labour market barometer of the Institute 
for Employment Research (IAB), unemployment 
is expected to decline only marginally in the 
coming months. The fact that some of the sea -Construction

sonally adjusted decline in unemployment in 
the first three months of the year was due to 
the mild winter weather is likely to play a part 
in this.
Prices
There was a 1% decline in crude oil prices (de -
nominated in US dollars) in March compared 
with the average for February. Over the course of April so far, oil prices have been trending up -
wards again, but have, on average, remained at the same level as in March. As this report 
went to press, the price of a barrel of Brent 
crude oil stood at US$110. The discount on 
crude oil futures stood at US$2¾ for deliveries 
six months ahead and US$5½ for purchases 
12 months ahead.
There was a further distinct month-  on-  month  
decline in seasonally adjusted import prices in 
February, for energy as well as for other goods. 
Domestic industrial producer prices showed a 
sideways movement in February before falling 
again in March. The year-  on-  year declin e in 
 import prices widened to -2.7% in February, 
whereas the negative year-  on-  year change in 
industrial producer prices narrowed from -1.1% 
in January to -0.9% in March.
Seasonally adjusted consumer prices in March 
remained at the level of the previous month. 
Energy prices dropped as a result of the lower 
crude oil prices, and food prices also fell per -
ceptibly. The prices of industrial goods and ser -
vices, as well as housing rents, maintained their 
upward trend, however. The year-  on-  year  
change in the national consumer price index 
narrowed from 1.2% in February to 1.0% in 
March. In the Harmonised Index of Consumer 
Prices (HICP) the rate declined from 1.0% to 0.9%, which was due, in part, to Easter 
 falling late this year.Public finances1
Local government finances
According to the latest cash flow data from the 
Federal Statistical Office, local government 
(core and off-  budget entities) posted a surplus 
of €1 billion in 2013. This is on a par with the 2012 figure, although the data for the first half 
of 2013 had signalled a much better result for 
the year as a whole. Revenue rose sharply over -
all (by 4%, or €8 billion). This was attributable, in particular, to higher transfers from state gov-
ernment (+8%, or €5½ billion), inter alia  as a 
result of state government increasing its gen -
eral grants and passing on more funds from 
central government (eg for the basic allowance for the elderly). Tax revenue also increased con-
siderably (+3¼%, or €2½ billion). This was 
chiefly due to strong growth in the municipal 
share of income tax (+6%, or €1½ billion), while net local business tax revenue (ie after 
deducting the revenue shares accruing to other 
government levels) only recorded a moderate 
rise for 2013 as a whole (+1%, or just under €½ billion) after declining during the second half of 
the year. Expenditure also recorded robust 
growth (+4%, or €8 billion). Of the current ex -
penditure items, spending on social benefits 
expanded particularly sharply (+5½%, or €2½ 
billion), notably on accommodation costs and 
outlays for social assistance. Moreover, person -
nel costs went up faster (+3½%, or €2 billion) than the calculated rate of increase implied by the 2012 wage agreement. Other operating ex-penditure rose at a more muted pace (by 2½%, 
or €1 billion), while interest expenses actually 
declined further. On the other hand, fixed asset formation rose sharply (+5%, or €1 billion) after 
falling perceptibly in the previous two years, with the federal states of Bavaria, Baden-
 
Württemberg  and Lower Saxony leading the International

1 In the short report on public finances, the emphasis is on 
recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the Monthly 
 Report (published in February, May, August and Novem -
ber), by contrast, contain a detailed description of general 
government budget trends during the preceding quarter. For detailed statistical data on budgetary developments 
and public debt, see the statistical section of this report.Deutsche Bundesbank

investment surge on balance. By contrast, real 
investment in the federal states of Saxony-  
Anhalt and Saxony, which were worst affected 
by the flood in spring 2013, posted declines of 
more than one-  tenth, despite the need for  
 reconstruction there.
In 2014, local government is likely to once again record a surplus overall. On the one 
hand, there could be further marked increases 
in expenditure – especially on social benefits and fixed asset formation, as well as on per -
sonnel in the wake of the latest wage agree -
ment. On the other hand, central government is assuming the entire costs of the basic allow -
ance for the elderly for the first time (by in -
creasing its contribution by €1 billion), while state government transfers to local govern -
ment over and above this are likely to again rise perceptibly overall. For the period 2015 to 2017, central government’s plans envisage additional annual relief of €1 billion for local government 
to provide integration assistance for people with disabilities. Furthermore, the central gov -
ernment budget plans up to 2017 evidently contain additional funds totalling €6 billion 
adopted in the coalition agreement, which are earmarked, in particular, for extending the pro -
vision of day care for small children, which falls 
within local government’s remit, and for schools.
2 However, there has so far been no 
binding allocation of these funds to individual 
financial years or applications, nor has local government so far been obligated to spend 
these resources on additional projects. Overall, 
markedly rising surpluses are likely in the me -
dium term, not least because central govern -
ment envisages even greater relief in the area of 
social benefits from 2018 onwards (by increas -
ing central government funds for integration 
 assistance by a further €4 billion per year).
Local government debt (including debt to the 
public sector) fell at the end of 2013 on the 
back of the surplus, dropping by €1¼ billion on 
the year to €137½ billion. This positive devel -
opment was primarily due to the significant 
 reduction in debt vis-  à - v is other public sector 
budgets in almost all federal states. By contrast, 
a decline in credit market debt and a rise in cash advances roughly balanced each other 
out. Thus, the worrying sustained upward 
trend in cash advances, which are actually only 
intended for bridging short-  term liquidity short -
falls, continued. Local governments in the fed -
eral states of Saarland, Rhineland-  P alatinate 
and North Rhine-  W estphalia in particular 
– which already had the highest burdens per 
inhabitant  – posted further increases in cash 
advances. By contrast, municipalities in the fed-
eral state of Hesse, which were also particularly 
highly indebted, recorded a significant decline 
in cash advances, which appears to be linked 
to the state’s establishment of a debt relief 
fund, whose resources are tied to strict consoli -
dation requirements. This was also the case in 
Lower Saxony, which has a similar fund.Renewed surplus

Securities markets
Bond market
At €131.8 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in February 2014 was well below 
the January figure (€151.3 billion). After de -
ducting redemptions, which were also consid -
erably lower than in the previous month, and 
taking account of changes in issuers’ holdings 
of their own bonds, the volume of outstanding 
domestic bonds increased by €0.7 billion. For -
eign debt securities worth €3.4 billion net were placed in the German market, so that the out-standing volume of debt securities in Germany increased by €4.1 billion overall.
In the month under review, the public sector 
increased its stock of bond market liabilities by 
€9.3 billion. Central government in particular 
(including the resolution agency which is classi -
fied as part of it) tapped the capital market for 
€8.6 billion net. It issued mainly five-  year F ed-
eral notes (Bobls) worth €4.1 billion, but also 
two-  year F ederal Treasury notes (Schätze) 
worth €3.5 billion, as well as 30-year Federal bonds (Bunds) worth €1.7 billion. This con -
trasted with net redemptions of Federal Treas -
ury discount paper (Bubills) for €3.4 billion. 
State and local government issued debt secur -
ities worth €0.6 billion in net terms.
In February, domestic enterprises increased their capital market debt by €0.4 billion net, compared with €3.5 billion in the previous month. Other financial intermediaries in par -
ticular took advantage of the favourable finan -
cing conditions and issued new bonds worth 
€2.7 billion net.
By contrast, credit institutions redeemed debt 
securities totalling €9.0 billion net in February. 
On balance, this was predominantly attribut -
able to debt securities issued by specialised credit institutions, the outstanding volume of 
which fell by €4.3 billion. There were also net 
redemptions of other bank debt securities (€2.8 billion), mortgage Pfandbriefe (€1.2 billion) and public Pfandbriefe (€0.7 billion).
Foreign investors were the sole buyers in Febru-
ary, stepping up their purchases of German 
debt securities by €13.9 billion. By contrast, 
 domestic non-  banks sold bonds worth €7 .4 bil -
lion; on balance, this was exclusively domestic paper. Resident credit institutions reduced their bond holdings by €1.9 billion
Equity market
In the month under review, new shares total -
ling €0.6 billion were issued in the German equity market, almost exclusively by listed 
enter  prises. In addition, the outstanding  
amount of foreign equities in Germany fell by 
€4.9 billion. Non-  r esident investors dominated 
the buyers’ side of the market in February, pur -
chasing €5.7 billion worth of shares. Domestic 
non- banks pur chased equities for €1.6 billion. Modest net

By contrast, German credit institutions reported 
net sales totalling €11.6 billion.
Mutual funds
In February, €8.4 billion flowed into domestic mutual funds, which was considerably more 
than in the previous month (€4.6 billion). The 
inflows benefited mainly specialised funds 
 reserved for institutional investors (€6.3 billion). 
Among the asset classes, mixed securities-  
based funds in particular recorded substantial 
inflows (€3.2 billion), but bond-  based funds  
(€2.4 billion) and mixed funds (€1.1 billion) also 
posted sizeable inflows. Foreign mutual funds 
sold fund shares worth €4.3 billion in the Ger -
man market. Mutual fund shares were bought 
solely by domestic non-  banks (€1 2.8 billion), 
while resident credit institutions sold fund 
shares worth €0.1 billion. On balance, foreign 
investors had only a marginal involvement in 
the German mutual fund market.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur -
plus – in unadjusted terms – of €13.9 billion in 
February 2014. The result was down by €1.3 billion from the previous month. This was at -
tributable to the reduction in the surplus in in -
visible current transactions, which exceeded 
the expansion in the trade surplus.
According to provisional calculations by the Federal Statistical Office, in February the for -
eign trade surplus went up by €1.2 billion on 
the month to €16.3 billion. However, after ad-
justment for seasonal and calendar variations, 
it decreased by €1.6 billion to €15.7 billion. 
Compared with the previous month, the value 
of exports fell (-1.3%), whereas imports rose 
slightly (+0.4%).

plus of €0.5 billion in invisible current transac -

The main reason for this decline was the sub-
stantial rise in the deficit for current transfers 
by €2.6 billion to €7.4 billion, which reflected, 
above all, higher payments to the EU budget. 
By contrast, net cross-  b order income grew 
slightly by €0.6 billion to €6.2 billion. The sur -
plus in the services account remained virtually 
unchanged at €1.7 billion.
Owing to heightened risk aversion as a result of 
increased capital outflows from emerging mar -
ket economies, German cross-  bor der portfolio 
investment recorded net capital imports of 
€15.8 billion in February. This development was 
due chiefly to non-  r esident market participants 
investing in German portfolios (€19.9 billion). 
Resident investors stepped up their holdings of foreign securities by a total of €4.1 billion.
Foreign investors mainly purchased German 
debt securities (€13.9 billion) and German equi -
ties (€5.9 billion). Resident market participants 
primarily acquired mutual fund shares (€4.3 bil-
lion) and debt securities (€3.4 billion) abroad. By contrast, they disposed of shares in the 
amount of €3.7 billion.
In February, direct investment generated net 
capital exports totalling €6.2 billion. The fact 
that resident firms provided their foreign affili -
ates with €10.5 billion in funding played a key role in this development. Credit transactions 
between affiliated enterprises (€4.3 billion) and 
the reinvestment of earnings generated abroad 
(€4.0 billion) were the driving factors. Foreign 
direct investment in Germany stood at €4.3 bil -
lion in February and was carried out, above all, 
in the form of loans from non-  r esident parent 
companies to their German subsidiaries.
Other statistically recorded investment – com -
prising financial and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank de -
posits and other assets – saw net capital out -
flows in February (€35.0 billion). Transactions 
by enterprises and households contributed 
€2.8 billion to this. Moreover, financial activities 
by general government led to net capital ex -
ports of €1.1 billion. The banking system ex -
perienced outflows of funds totalling €31.0 bil-
lion. This was reflected in an increase in credit 
institutions’ net external assets to €22.0 billion. 
Furthermore, the Bundesbank’s external pos -
ition increased by €9.0 billion. This is attribut -
able, among others, to short-  term deposits  
with the Bundesbank of €10.2 billion being 
withdrawn, primarily by central banks outside 
the Eurosystem. The Bundesbank’s TARGET2 
balance decreased by €1.1 billion.
The Bundesbank’s reserve assets went up – at

On the reliability of international 
organisations’ estimates of the output gap
Macroeconomic analyses are often based on a decomposition of aggregate activity into poten -
tial (or trend) output and a cyclical component, the output gap. As an economy’s potential out -
put is unknown, estimates of this gap, which can assume positive or negative values, are, in 
practice, associated with a high degree of uncertainty. In the past, simple as well as more com -
plex statistical procedures have proven fairly unreliable as a way of deriving trend output at the 
current end. Later revisions were often as large as the previously identified gap itself. This was 
attributable less to corrections to the underlying data than to the changing assessment of the 
cyclical position over time.
If, in a bid to evaluate estimates of the output gaps for important industrial countries, one com -
pares International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Devel -
opment (OECD) estimates as given in their regular publications from the spring of 1999 onwards 
with the appropriate real-  time measur es as derived using a simple statistical procedure, it becomes 
evident that the estimates provided by the international institutions are by no means more reli -
able. There are large revisions, and the published output gaps change their sign relatively fre -
quently. Unlike with the results of simple filter methods, the need for corrections does not appear 
to be limited to estimates at the current end where there has been a turnaround in economic 
momentum. In fact, output gaps for more distant years are frequently also revised. This can 
mainly be explained by reassessments of an economy’s potential growth path.In addition, there is some evidence to suggest that international organisations’ estimates of the 
output gap for the years just ended are frequently initially too unfavourable, ie too deep in, or 
too close to, negative territory for the selected circle of countries and period. In the following 
rounds, these estimates have generally been revised up. Consequently, major economies’ poten -
tial was probably considerably overestimated during the boom at the turn of the millennium and in the years immediately preceding the global financial crisis. The subsequent drop in output was 
initially interpreted as a cyclical phenomenon. It was not until recoveries proved weak that it 
appears gradually to have become apparent that the preceding upwards movements were unsus -
tainable.
Given past experience, it cannot be ruled out that the IMF and the OECD will, in the future, correct 
their information on the output gaps at the current end and going further back. Given this uncer -
tainty, such estimates have to be treated with caution in economic policy practice, say when 
analysing cyclically adjusted fiscal deficits, or in a monetary policy context.Deutsche Bundesbank

Basic problem with the 
 output gap
For macroeconomic analyses and models, ag -
gregate activity as measured by real gross do -
mestic product (GDP) is often broken down 
into potential output and a cyclical component. 
The latter measures the (positive or negative) 
gap between actual and potential economic 
performance and is also called the output gap. It reflects cyclical ups and downs and indicates, amongst other things, whether an economy is 
experiencing demand-  side upwar ds or down -
wards pressure on prices. Potential output is generally defined as that level of activity that occurs when capacity utilisation in the econ -
omy as a whole is “normal”. Capacity is, in 
turn, dictated by supply-  s ide determinants of 
longer-  term growth. These include the econo -
my’s supply of labour and capital equipment. Technology, the institutional framework and 
structural policy are also important.
Unlike the now wide-  s pread interpretation of 
potential output as the level of activity that pre -
vails under normal capacity utilisation, econo -
mists used to interpret it as full-  e mployment 
output in a Keynesian context.1 In their view, 
the question was how high aggregate demand 
must be in order to close the gap between maximum possible and actual output, which 
 always veers towards underutilisation. Factors 
such as demographic developments, which de -
termine full-  employment output, may also, via 
investment demand, impact the level of under -
employment in the longer term. This relation -
ship is at the centre of the Keynesian theory of 
“secular stagnation”, in which interest has re -
cently reawakened (see box on pages 16 to 19).
As potential output and the output gap are the 
result of a notional decomposition of actually 
measured economic output,2 they cannot be 
observed directly. In the national accounts, the 
official statistics estimate only actual output, 
not potential output. The output gap can 
therefore only be approximated using suitable 
procedures based on the available data. A wide range of methods are available, however.3 Be-
cause potential output can be understood as 
the economy’s output adjusted for cyclical fluc -
tuations (or trend output), an obvious approach is to use simple statistical procedures to smooth 
real GDP .4 In particular, this includes the 
Hodrick-  Pr escott filter (HP filter), which is often 
used in practice.5 Alternatively, more complex 
econometric models can also be used to deter -
mine potential output and the output gap.

put. New Keynesian models, for instance, regularly take it to be the level of activity that would occur where prices are flexible. See, eg, M T Kiley (2013), Output Gaps, Journal of Macroeconomics, Vol 37, pp 1-18.

4 Estimating an economy’s production possibilities as a 
measure of its potential output includes analysing available 
capacity. By contrast, simple statistical procedures, which take no additional economic information into account, 
only determine a time series’ mathematical trend. We will, in this article, not differentiate strictly between “potential” and “trend” and the associated output gaps.5 When extracting a time series’ trend component, the HP 
filter, according to a specified smoothing parameter, bal -
ances minimising cyclical fluctuations against minimising 
changes in the growth rate of the trend component. See

OECD, currently use, plays a prominent role.6 It 
ultimately includes an analysis of the available 
capacity in the economy as a whole and its 
supply-  side determinants. This is because a pr o-
duction function describes how the quantities 
of labour and capital employed and the tech -
nology used make up aggregate output.7 To 
derive the respective potential growth path 
from actual developments in labour input or 
what is known as total factor productivity (as a measure of technology), simple cyclical adjust-
ment procedures can again be used, such as 
the HP filter, although at a different level than when directly smoothing real GDP .
Concrete estimates of the output gap depend 
on which procedure is chosen. This is clear from a comparison of the IMF’s and OECD’s 
autumn 2013 data on the output gap in the G7 
economies with the estimate resulting from an 
HP filter.8 All three procedures appear to yield a 
similar cyclical pattern across this group of 
countries – with peaks and troughs at virtually 
identical points in time. In addition, no major 
discrepancies are noticeable in terms of the size 
of the cyclical output component for the dec -
ades immediately before and after the turn of 
the millennium. However, the data differ 
widely, especially at the current end.9 For in -
stance, the IMF last autumn reported that the 
seven largest advanced economies experienced overall capacity underutilisation of 3% in 2012, 
while the output gap in this group of countries 
had already been closed according to the HP 
filter. The OECD data imply capacity underutil -
isation of 2% for this group of countries as a 
whole, although this masks discrepancies, 
some large, as compared to the IMF estimates 
for individual industrialised nations. For in -
stance, the Fund expects much larger gaps for 
the United States (-4¼%) and Japan (-2¼%) than the OECD (-2½% and -1% respectively), while the OECD, in turn, forecasts a greater 
shortfall in aggregate demand for Italy (-4½% 
versus - 3½%).
While concerns that inflation is easing have 
 recently been voiced in some industrialised countries, it is rather surprising, given the per -
sistently large negative output gaps being re -
ported by international organisations, that in -
flation rates have remained in positive territory 
fairly consistently in recent years. Based on a 
Phillips curve, attempts to explain this circum -
stance have focused, first, on the fact that in -
flation expectations are firmly anchored and, 
second, on the weaker impact of cyclical fac -
tors on inflation over time, as explained in an -

6 While the OECD generally uses a production function ap-proach in connection with a Phillips curve, which has been 
described by Giorno et al (1995), Beffy et al (2006) and 
Johansson et al (2013), the IMF has not committed to using one specific procedure. In general, estimates are, however, 
also likely to have been based on such a method in the 
past. In addition, the Fund appears recently increasingly to 
have used a multivariate filter procedure developed by 
Benes et al (2010), which is based on various cyclical correl -
ations and therefore also takes into consideration add -
itional information on the state of the economy. See

Secular stagnation and economic growth
The theory of “secular stagnation”, posited 
in particular by Alvin Hansen in the late 
1930s, is based on the Keynesian notion of 
market equilibrium with underemployment. 
From this perspective, the key question is 
how high aggregate demand in the econ-
omy has to be in order to close an output 
gap tending consistently towards capacity underutilisation. In this scenario, factors 
which determine the path of potential out-
put may also infl  uence the level of aggre-gate demand in the economy via invest-ment demand, and affect the level of underemployment over the longer term. 
According to Hansen, there is a connection 
between a slowdown in potential output 
growth and increasing underemployment.1 
Not least, a decline in population growth will slow the expansion in investment de-mand and, as a result, an economy’s cap-
acity utilisation will fall further.
The background to this theory is the fact 
that the Great Depression (1929 to 1933) in 
the United States occurred in a period of declining population growth. An examin-ation of the unemployment rate and the 
year- on- year rate of change in the resident 
population (of working age) in the United 
States does indeed appear to reveal a nega-
tive correlation between the two variables 
in the fi  rst half of the twentieth century. The US economy’s slide into renewed recession 
in 1937 is likely to have given further sup-
port at the time to the belief that the sharp increase in underemployment at the begin-
ning of the decade might be a “secular” 
problem, ie persistent, and not just cyclical. However, in the second half of the twenti-
eth century, there is no noticeable correl-
ation between population growth and the 
unemployment rate. The distinct drop in 
the unemployment rate in recent years, at a time of only moderate expansion in aggre-
gate output, could in fact be an indication 
that demographic change is assisting the 
current labour market recovery rather than 
hindering it.2Of late there has again been increased dis-cussion of a possible connection between a slowdown in potential growth, especially as 
a result of demographic change, and per-
sistent slack in the economy.3 The hypoth-
esis has been proposed that such a situ-
ation may arise in association with the zero 
bound on nominal interest rates.4 To illus-
trate this, a distinction is fi  rst drawn be-
tween various concepts of the real interest 
rate.5 The “natural” or “neutral” rate of 
interest is defi  ned as that real interest rate 
at which the output gap will be closed in the medium term. Supply- side and de-
mand- side shocks may cause it to fl  uctuate around the real interest rate which prevails 
in the economy’s long- term equilibrium 
1 Ultimately, the economy would enter a state of high 
underemployment and stagnating potential output. 
According to Higgins (1950), however, Hansen’s use of 
the term “secular stagnation” referred to the stage of 
declining potential growth and rising underemploy-ment. See A Hansen (1939), Economic Progress and Declining Population Growth, American Economic  Review, Vol 29, pp 1-15, reprinted in Population and Development Review (2004), Vol  30, pp  329-342;

166; and A Scaperlanda (1977), Hansen’s Secular Stag-nation Thesis Once Again, Journal of Economic Issues, Vol 11, No 2, pp 223-243.
2 See Deutsche Bundesbank, The decline in labour 
force participation in the USA, Monthly Report, May 
2012, pp 19-21.3 Some have interpreted the newly formulated theory 
of “secular stagnation” as operating in a different di-
rection, whereby persistent capacity underutilisation in an economy may permanently fl  atten that economy’s potential growth path. Although temporary weakness in investment delays growth in the capital stock and a lengthy period of high underutilisation may also bring about a lasting reduction in the level of potential out-
put, particularly through an increase in structural un-
employment, ultimately, longer- term growth in the economy’s overall productive capacity remains un-
affected. See, for example, D Reifschneider, W Wascher 
and D Wilcox (2013), Aggregate Supply in the United 
States: Recent Developments and Implications for the

state. This long- term equilibrium real inter-
est rate is, in turn, determined by funda-
mental economic factors such as potential 
output growth and saving behaviour.
The central bank can set the (short- term) 
nominal interest rate and thereby infl  uence 
the actual real interest rate in a situation of 
price rigidity. This gives monetary policy-
makers a stabilising role in the short term. If 
the actual real interest rate is below the 
natural rate of interest, then monetary pol-icy has an expansionary effect and, if there 
is a negative output gap, helps to close it and to ease the downward pressure on 
prices. However, if the natural rate of inter-est is negative, it is possible that, with given infl  ation expectations, the central bank will 
be unable to cut the real interest rate to a 
suffi   cient extent because of the zero bound on nominal interest rates. If the natural rate of interest has slid into negative territory on 
a lasting basis, ie if the long- term equilib-
rium real interest rate has similarly altered, 
then the economy may be caught in a per-manent scenario of underutilised capacity.
The possibility of the natural rate of interest 
slipping temporarily below zero and the im-
plications of this have been discussed by a 
number of economists within the frame-work of state- of- the- art New Keynesian models.
6 However, it is diffi   cult for such 
models to capture a shift in the long- term 
equilibrium real interest rate because this is 
ultimately determined by the rate of time preference for a representative economic 
agent.7 Eggertsson and Mehrotra (2014) re-
cently set out a solution for this.8 An un-
equal distribution of income over an eco-
nomic agent’s life cycle gives rise to supply 
of or demand for loans at different stages 
of life. As Samuelson (1958) explained, 
when overlapping generations of economic 
agents are brought into the picture, the long- term equilibrium real interest rate 
brings the supply of and demand for loans 
between the generations into balance.9 
Thus, shocks to fundamental variables can 
drive the long- term equilibrium real interest rate below zero and thereby reduce output below its potential level on a lasting basis.
10 
However, the model proposed by Eggerts-
son and Mehrotra (2014) does not capture 
the possibility of savings in the economy as 
6 In New Keynesian models, price rigidity means that 
even purely monetary shocks have an impact on the 
real economy in the short term. In this, the natural rate 
of interest and the level of potential output are regu-
larly defi  ned in terms of the level of activity in a situ-
ation of fl  exible prices. The economic policy implica-
tions of a temporarily negative natural rate of interest with a binding lower limit for the nominal interest rate 
(liquidity trap) have been investigated within the 
framework of a simple New Keynesian model by, for 
example, Werning (2011) and Cochrane (2013). See

J  H  Cochrane (2013), The New- Keynesian Liquidity 
Trap, NBER, Working Paper No 19476.
7 Schmitt- Grohé and Uribe (2013) have formulated a 
model in which a confi  dence shock and self- fulfi  lling expectations create a permanent liquidity trap and 
underemployment. See S Schmitt- Grohé and M Uribe

10 For example, an exogenous reduction of the bor-
rowing limit for young people (deleveraging) could 
cause the real interest rate to fall – and not just in the 
short term but for a relatively long period – because the supply of credit from this generation at a later stage in life is increased. See G  Eggertsson and

a whole in the form of physical capital. Yet 
in terms of long- term economic growth, 
decisions about capital investment and cap-
ital stock are likely to be of key importance, 
particularly in connection with overlapping 
generations.
The neoclassical theory of growth offers a 
consistent model framework in which to  investigate the connection between the 
long- term equilibrium real interest rate and 
the underlying rate of expansion in an economy. Within this theory, the profi  t- maximising behaviour of enterprises in a 
scenario of perfect competition causes the 
marginal productivity of capital to match its 
factor price. A negative (net) real interest 
rate implies that the rate of depreciation ex-
ceeds the positive marginal productivity of 
capital. However, if that were the case in an 
economy without population growth or technological advance, the capital stock would be ineffi   ciently large owing to an  excess of previous capital investment, meaning that consumption opportunities could still be expanded even in the long term through a reduction in capital. But if 
intertemporal optimisation in a representa-
tive household is factored into the equa-
tion, then such a state of affairs can hardly 
constitute an equilibrium. Ultimately the 
equilibrium real interest rate in a stationary 
economy will correspond to households’ 
positive rate of time preference. This means 
that economic agents with a predominant 
preference for current consumption need to 
be compensated in the form of a positive real interest rate for forgoing current con-sumption in order to maintain the capital 
stock.
If long- term growth in the economy through population growth and techno-
logical advance is now added in, the equi-
librium real interest rate in a neoclassical 
world is higher than the increase in poten-
tial output.11 There may be deviation from 
this rule and thus accumulation of an ineffi   -ciently large capital stock if, in models with 
overlapping generations, capital formation represents the only means of making provi-sion for the future.
12 However, factoring in 
a non- reproducible production factor, ie 
land, would prevent what is called dynamic ineffi   ciency even in the above scenario, be-cause arbitrage would mean that the prod-
uctivity of capital could not fall below the 
positive rate of return on land.13 In addition, 
an ineffi   ciently large capital stock would 
imply that capital investment exceeds in-
come from capital. However, that does not 
appear to be borne out by empirical fi  nd-
ings.14
A negative equilibrium real interest rate 
would nonetheless be conceivable, without 
breaching the effi   ciency condition, if the 
potential output of an economy shrank to a 
suffi   cient extent.15 Therefore, the empirical 
question as to long- term growth prospects in the industrial countries remains. Although 
the expansion of potential output in the United States is likely to have weakened 
 noticeably in recent years, not least owing 
to demographic change, it has not come to a standstill.

14 In empirical investigations into the theory of dy-
namic ineffi   ciency resulting from the gap between 
interest rates and growth rates, it needs to be borne in 
mind that investments in physical capital entail risks, 
which means that ultimately the result does not hinge 
on the interest rate on risk- free investments, which is 
often the focus of abstract models and public debate. See A B Abel, N G Mankiw, L H Summers and R J Zeck-

Moreover, large discrepancies between esti -
mates of the output gap suggest that the 
underutilisation of overall capacity in the econ-
omy may not be as pronounced as is frequently 
assumed. The measure of the output gap 
chosen also has consequences for the observed 
sensitivity of the rate of inflation to economic 
ups and downs. When estimating the Phillips 
curve for the euro area and individual member states, this sensitivity tends to be weaker if the 
large output gaps published by the IMF are used. By contrast, cyclical sensitivity proves higher if the smaller output gaps determined 
with the help of the HP filter are used (see box on pages 21 to 24).
As the “true” output gap cannot be known, it 
is impossible to decide which estimate most 
closely approximates it. One possible indication 
of the reliability of such information may be to 
analyse how susceptible it is to revision at the 
current end. The underlying idea is that revi -sions reflect additional information and result 
in a “final” figure. Where initial estimates devi-ate relatively little from the “final” figures, they are considered fairly reliable.
In general, revisions to estimated output gaps 
may have various causes; sometimes, they are 
inevitable. For instance, the underlying data material may simply have been corrected, ie, 
for simple univariate procedures, the time ser -
ies on real GDP . Moreover, the need for revi -
sions is obvious given that the future outlook is key to determining the current cyclical position. If expectations prove wrong, the assessment of the past years also changes retrospectively. For 
instance, a situation is conceivable in which a 
cyclical peak with a positive output gap be-comes apparent only as a result of a subse -
quent, unexpected downturn. Conversely, after Estimates’ sus-
ceptibility to 
 
revision as 
 
yardstickP
ossible reasons 
for revisionslation of working age has merely become 
sluggish, it has not turned into a lasting contraction. In addition, those who have 
been expressing well- founded doubts as to 
the continuation of the high levels of US productivity growth observed in the past 
point only to slower technological advance, not technological decay.
17 Even in the case 
of Japan, where the working- age popula-
tion has been shrinking for some time, esti-mates generally continue to indicate an up-ward trajectory for potential output.
18
Overall, the natural rate of interest and the 
long- term equilibrium real interest rate can 
no more readily be observed than potential 
output or the output gap; estimates of 
these variables come with a high degree of 
uncertainty. As potential output is presum-
ably still trending upwards, the long- term equilibrium real interest rate in major ad-vanced economies is likely to be positive, even if it has fallen as a result of demo-graphic change. Therefore, the argument that developed economies may currently be 
in a state of secular stagnation probably 
lacks empirical signifi  cance.

18 Even in the context of continued positive potential 
growth, doubt has been cast on the signifi  cance of a 
lasting negative equilibrium real interest rate for under-
utilisation of capacity in the Japanese economy. See 
K Nishizaki, T Sekine and Y Ueno (2012), Chronic De-
fl  ation in Japan, Bank of Japan, Working Paper No  12-E-6. Ikeda and Saito (2012) use simulations 
within the framework of a dynamic general equilibrium model to show that the fall in the ratio of the working- age population to the total population in recent years has resulted in a marked fall in the natural rate of inter-
est in Japan. However, fl  uctuations in technological 
advance have proved more signifi  cant in this connec-
tion. See D Ikeda and M Saito (2012), The Effects of Demographic Changes on the Real Interest Rate in 
Japan, Bank of Japan, Working Paper No 12-E-3.

a recession the question arises as to whether 
an economy can return to its previous path of 
activity. It might be possible to identify output losses as permanent only after a rapid recovery process fails to materialise for some time, mak -
ing it necessary to retract the initial assessment that there is a large degree of underutilisation. Similarly, when applying a filter procedure, the 
assessment of the underlying trend may also 
change as further developments come to light 
as compared to the previous assessment that was made based on incomplete information. 
The trend is especially likely to be adjusted at a 
later date near cyclical highs or lows (that are 
determined ex post ). This end-  point issue is fre-
quently described as the weakness of the HP filter.
11 Using more complex models to deter -
mine potential output, the model’s susceptibil-
ity for revision itself represents another source 
of corrections to the estimated cyclical output 
component.Orphanides and van Norden (2002) have exam -
ined the reliability of estimates of the output gap at the current end for the US economy, 
which they constructed based on real-  time  
data using simple statistical trend extraction methods such as the HP filter but also more 
complex models. These more complex models 
included additional economic information. On 
balance, the authors concluded that the real-  
time estimates produced by the various pro -
cedures were generally not very reliable. The subsequent revisions were frequently of the 
same order of magnitude as the initial esti -
mates of the gap. This was due only in small 
part to later corrections to the underlying data. 
The stubborn problem of reliably distinguishing trend and cycle at the current end proved more 
decisive. This ultimately reflects the fact that 
 future economic developments are unknown. 
After all, the more complex procedures did not 
outperform equivalent univariate methods. The 
information advantage of including additional 
variables has to be weighed against the fact 
that the greater complexity also entails the pos -
sibility of additional revisions.12

of smoothing, in which both past and future data are taken into consideration. At the current end, there is no “punish-ment” for a later reversal of a change in trend when weigh -

ary fluctuations more closely at the current end than in the

Cyclical sensitivity of the infl  ation rate in the euro area 
and in selected euro- area countries depending on the output gap estimate
Even before the global recession of 2008-
09, various empirical studies found that in 
industrial countries the cyclical sensitivity of 
consumer prices had been declining since 
the mid-1980s. Analysts put forward the 
 increasing importance of cross- border price relationships in the wake of globalisation, a 
better anchoring of infl  ation expectations and the special environment of low infl  a-tion rates as possible explanations for this 
decline.1 The comparatively weak response 
of the core rates in particular (eg based on 
the (harmonised) index of consumer prices 
excluding energy and unprocessed food) to 
the economic slump in 2008-09 initially provided a further indication of such a  decline.
2 However, the recent marked 
 decline in  infl  ation has led to speculation in 
various quarters that the connection  between price developments and cyclical 
developments may have intensifi  ed again of late, at least in some euro- area countries.
3
The analytical concept often used in this 
context is the Phillips curve. It was originally 
based on the empirical observation that 
wage growth and the unemployment rate 
are negatively correlated.4 This approach 
was then extended by additionally mapping 
the relationship between consumer price infl  ation and unemployment. In a further step, the macroeconomic output gap was 
introduced as the indicator for the cyclical 
position in place of the unemployment rate. 
During booms and when levels of capacity 
utilisation are high, the observed infl  ation rate is indeed relatively high, whereas it is 
fairly low in periods of recession. Using the 
Phillips curve model, the output gap thus serves as an indicator for price trend esti-
mation which can also be forward- looking.
However, in this context it is important to 
note that estimated capacity utilisation can vary considerably depending on the proced-ure used to calculate the output gap. In this 
analysis, we thus examine the impact that the choice of procedure has on the econo-metric estimates of the cyclical sensitivity of 
infl  ation rates both for the euro area as a 
whole and for selected euro- area countries. 
We use data on output gaps published in the IMF’s October 2013 World Economic 
Outlook (WEO) and deviations of real GDP 
from its trend extracted from the GDP time 
series using the Hodrick- Prescott fi  lter (HP fi  lter) – a purely statistical method.
5 The 
current end is of particular interest as it is 
here that the results for the output gap are particularly divergent. For instance, for both 
the euro area as a whole and for France there is a divergence of two percentage points between the results from the two procedures; in the case of Italy, it is even over three percentage points. By contrast, Germany’s capacity utilisation is virtually 
identical in both procedures.

We use a traditional expectations- 
augmented Phillips curve for an open econ-
omy as the theoretical background for our 
econometric estimates. Infl  ation is deter-
mined using three factors: infl  ation expect-
ations (these may be forward or backward- 
looking), the cyclical component (output gap) and external factors (eg commodity 
prices):
π stands for the infl  ation rate, πe for the 
 expected infl  ation rate, y for the output gap and roh for commodity prices; t is the time 
index.
6
The price dynamics to be explained are 
 represented, on the one hand, by the har-
monised index of consumer prices (HICP) 
and, on the other, by the core component 
(HICP excluding energy und unprocessed 
food). Annualised seasonally adjusted quar-
terly growth rates feed into the estimation 
equation. Infl  ation expectations are meas-ured using Consensus Economics’ six to ten- year infl  ation forecasts. Commodity 
prices are taken from the HWWI commod-ity price index (euro basis). Furthermore, we include the lagged infl  ation rate to address 
any possible persistence resulting from backward- looking expectations, among 
other factors.
In the past, irrespective of the procedure 
used to estimate the output gap, the same headline or core infl  ation rate has coincided 
with very different cyclical positions.7 For 
 instance, in 2000, when core rates were 
very low in all countries analysed, both the 
IMF output gap fi  gures and the HP fi  lter 
 results showed an overutilisation of cap-acity, whereas in 2008-09 and 2013 the same core rates coincided with a – some-times considerable  – underutilisation of 
capacity. This already indicates that cyclical 
fl  uctuations have a relatively moderate im-
pact on price developments. Furthermore, 
the fi  gures show that medium- term expect-ations were very stable in the past, remain-ing around 2%. In the period under review, 
fl  uctuations in infl  ation rates seem to have 
6 In many cases, the Phillips curve is estimated using 
the deviation of the observed unemployment rate 
from the long- term trend (NAIRU). However, under 
Okun’s Law there is a relationship between the output 
gap and the gap  derived using the unemployment 
rate.7 As the seasonally adjusted quarterly growth rates are 
highly volatile, especially for the HICP , the chart and 
tables show year- on- year price changes. These show a slight cyclical lag which is not present in the annualised quarterly growth rates.Cyclical sensitivity of infl  ation rates in the period from 1996 to 2009 depending on the output gap

had only a limited impact on infl  ation ex-
pectations.
First, regressions are performed for the 
period from 1996 to 2009, when the out-
put gaps calculated using the two proced-
ures are generally relatively similar. The im-
pact of these output gaps proves to be stat-
istically signifi  cant in all specifi  cations. The 
estimated coeffi   cients of cyclical sensitivity 
are practically the same irrespective of 
which output gap is chosen. Where there 
are deviations, for instance in the results for 
France, these are rarely statistically signifi  -cant. The cyclical sensitivity of the HICP headline rates is higher than that of the 
core rates.8
If the period is extended until 2013, ie to include the period where output gaps  diverge more widely, the results then 
change signifi  cantly in some cases. The cyc-
lical impact is still statistically signifi  cant in 
almost all cases, and the cyclical sensitivity 
of HICP headline rates still tends to be higher than that of the core rates. France 
and Italy are exceptions; in these countries 
the two infl  ation rates are shown to have almost identical levels of sensitivity to the 
IMF output gap estimates. Above all, how-ever, there is often a signifi  cant divergence between the estimated coeffi   cients for 
those specifi  cations which differ only in the 
choice of output gap. Given the relatively 
similar estimates of the cyclical position for 
Germany, divergences are the lowest for 
this country. By contrast, the differences are 
greater for the HICP headline rate for the 
euro area, France and Italy. In all cases cited 
above, cyclical sensitivity calculated using 
the IMF fi  gures is distinctly lower than that 
calculated using the HP fi  lter- based output 
gaps. The difference between the estimated co effi   cients is statistically signifi  cant for Italy 
in particular. These observations are true, but to a lesser extent, for the core rates, 
too.
A comparison of the estimated cyclical sen-
sitivity between the two time periods re-
veals no notable differences for Germany due to the similar output gap develop-ments. By contrast, for the euro area, France and Italy, the HP fi  lter- based esti-mates of the output gap coeffi   cients tend 
to be higher for the entire period from 1996 
to 2013 than in the period up to 2009,

while sensitivity calculated using IMF esti-
mates declined. The shifts in the HICP head-
line rates are higher than those in the core 
rates. However, the differences between 
the estimated coeffi   cients are not statistic-
ally signifi  cant in any of the cases.
Overall, it can be said that the differences between the output gaps estimated using different procedures are refl  ected in the 
 estimated cyclical sensitivity of the infl  ation rate even though the Phillips curve relation-
ship is confi  rmed for all specifi  cations. A wider output gap tends to be “compen-
sated” by a lower response coeffi   cient. The 
cyclical impact is thus relatively small, irre-
spective of the procedure used to calculate the output gap. However, it is not possible to confi  rm the hypothesis that the relation-
ship weakened even further during the  crisis purely on the basis of the estimates shown here. A trend towards a weaker  relationship is only observed when using the comparatively wide negative output 
gap estimates by the IMF and when there is 
a major divergence between these fi  gures 
and those calculated using the HP fi  lter.Output gaps and inflation rates

is examined below.13 Every publication contains 
a time series with estimates of an economy’s 
capacity utilisation in recent years. Only data 
on historical gaps are included in order to ex -
clude revisions that are obviously the result of 
uncertainties in connection with macroeco -
nomic forecasts. That means that, looking for 
instance at the WEO of April 1999, the last es -
timate included in the analysis refers to the 
output gap in 1998. Conversely, the WEO data 
of the spring of the following year represent the first historical estimate of overall capacity utilisation in 1998. Particular attention is paid to these initial estimates available from 1998 
onwards, as they are the best proxy for the cur -
rent end, which is important for economic pol -
icymakers. To determine reliability, they are 
compared to the most recent estimates taken 
from the respective autumn 2013 publica -
tions.14 The evolution of the estimates from the 
initial to the most recent is likely to be interest -
ing, as is the question as to whether, and to what extent, information on output gaps has 
been revised in the more distant past, which is 
why the period prior to 1998 is also con -
sidered.15 At the same time, the reliability of 
the estimates that have been derived by simple 
smoothing of real-  time data on the r eal GDP 
using the HP filter is analysed as the bench -
mark.16The analysis of the output gaps obtained using the HP filter confirms and illustrates the results 
of Orphanides and van Norden (2002). If one 
looks at the difference between the maximum and the minimum figures for the output gap in 
each individual year, a mean range of 1 per -
centage point is, for instance, calculated for 
the United States in the 1998 to 2010 period, 
for which initial estimates can be observed at 
the current end. Looking at the most recent 
 estimates and neglecting the sign, the average 
output gap for this period also works out to 
around 1%. Consequently, the revisions are, in fact, quite large in relation to the actual gaps. End- point issue

there are, to date, no comparable OECD estimates.
15 Estimates of the output gap dating back to the year 
1980 are considered here, although data even went back 
to 1970 prior to the autumn 2003 WEO. On the other 
hand, the observation period is concluded with the output gap for 2010, for which at least six historical estimates are available.16 For more on the concrete details of the derivation, see 
footnote 8. The choice of the smoothing parameter of 
6.25 follows Koske and Pain (2008), who examine the sus -
ceptibility for revision specifically of the OECD data com -
pared to real-  time estimates based on the HP filter . The 
results of the analysis presented below do not change ma-terially in qualitative terms if a parameter of 100 is assumed 
instead, which is also used frequently. See I  Koske and N Pain (2008), The Usefulness of Output Gaps for Policy Analysis, OECD  Economics Department, Working Paper

Deviations are particularly pronounced for the 
cyclical highs. For instance, the range reached 
1¼ percentage points in 1999-2000, and even 
figures of 2 percentage points and more in 
2007-08. This demonstrates the unreliability of 
trend extraction by the HP filter at the current 
end, when economic momentum turns. By 
contrast, the output gaps estimated for the 
period prior to 1998 do not deviate much. This is primarily because further economic develop -
ments are known for this period, and trend 
output only needs revising to take account of 
small corrections to historical GDP data.17
However, the IMF and OECD estimates yield a 
different picture. The range of their data ap -
pears to be significantly wider. However, the fact that the international organisations esti -
mate considerably larger output gaps on aver -
age puts this into some perspective. In other 
words, they assume a higher cyclical amplitude but a smoother potential growth path than the 
HP filter with the specifications chosen here.18 In addition, it is striking that it is not only the 
output gaps at the current end that are subject 
to large-  scale r evisions, but also those for more 
distant years. In fact, the IMF even appears to 
correct its data for the period prior to 1998 
more than its estimates for more recent output gaps. For instance, the autumn 2000 WEO re -
ported capacity underutilisation of 5½% of po -
tential output for the US economy in 1982. In 
September 2002, the Fund  r evised its estimate 
to -9¼%, before lowering it to -5% again in its 
2007 spring publication. The estimates of the 
output gap in the years 1983 to 1985 also fluc -

17 However, a similar problem occurs at the historical end 
as some time series go back to 1970, while others do not 
start until 1980.
18 One way to obtain a relative measure of the size of 
 revisions would be to look at the mean range of the esti -
mates in relation to the mean absolute output gap. If the 
smoothing parameter of the HP filter is set to 100, the 
 resulting cyclical fluctuations are of similar magnitude to 
those in the data supplied by the international organisa -
tions. The range of the (revised) estimates based on the HP 
filter is also larger as a result; however, the relation be -
tween the mean range and the mean absolute output gap tends to remain unchanged.Deutsche Bundesbank

tuated by up to 4 percentage points. And revi-
sions like those observed for the United States 
are by no means unique. The estimates for Canada definitely represent an outlier. In the 
October 2007 WEO, IMF staff raised the coun -
try’s output gap for 1980 from just under 2% 
to almost 10%, and the figures for the follow -
ing years were revised by a similar amount. However, these revisions were retracted only 
two publications later. Across all publications 
studied here, the IMF estimates for the Can -
adian output gap in the years 1980 to 1997 
reach an average range of around 11 percent -
age points. For Italy, too, IMF staff corrected its 
estimates of the cyclical position in the 1980s, 
massively in some cases. The April 2009 WEO 
upped the output gap for 1980 from 3% 
to 13¼%. The autumn 2013 edition still re -
ported overutilisation of 12¼% for 1980, which 
fell to just over 1% the following year. Given 
that real GDP expanded by less than 1%, this 
implies a sudden increase in Italy’s potential 
output by around 12% in 1981.
As the revisions are so large, it is not uncom -
mon for a negative output gap to become 
positive, and vice versa,  across the different 
vintages of estimates. For the international 
 organisations, the same applies to estimates of 
the cyclical position in the more distant past. 
Looking at the estimates produced by the 
OECD since 1999 for the output gap in the US 
economy between 1980 and 1997, seven of those years saw at least one sign change, 
which is exactly the same number as in the 
later period. The IMF changed the sign of its 
estimates for as many as 13 of the 18 years in 
the earlier period; only the output gaps 
 between 1981 and 1983 and in the 1988-
89 period were consistently confirmed as being 
below and above zero, respectively. By con -
trast, there were generally only a few sign 
changes in the earlier period for the cyclical 
positions obtained using a simple filter proced -
ure.19 Based on this criterion, the simple 
smoothing procedure at least does not tend to 
perform any worse for the 1998-2010 period than the international organisations’ esti -mates.
20 Japan is an exception, however. The 
IMF in particular has not revised its hypothesis 
of lasting capacity underutilisation in Japan’s economy, which is probably founded on the 
country’s mild but persistent deflation.Signs of esti-

19 The same applies when the HP filter is given a smooth -

– and thus no information on actual developments in the 
relevant year or subsequently – were used to extrapolate 
the underlying GDP time series at the current end, which 
ought to put the simple smoothing procedure at an infor -
mational disadvantage to the estimates produced by the

The fact that the international organisations’ 
usual corrections have a much longer historical 
reach than those performed using a simple fil -
ter procedure is probably the main reason why their revisions are comparatively large and also stretch back into the distant past. This becomes 
apparent when observing the adjustments to the time series for the output gap from one WEO to the next and calculating their mean across the different publications and coun -
tries.
21 Revisions to estimates produced using 
the HP filter are generally clustered around the current end of the time series; additional obser -
vations cause revisions to the cyclical position 
only for the immediately preceding years. The 
influence of additional observations wanes as 
the length of the intervening period increases, depending on the choice of smoothing param -
eter and thus on the assumed length of a busi -
ness cycle.
22 Output gaps in the distant past are 
therefore only corrected via rather infrequent and usually small revisions to historical GDP 
data. The picture for the international organisa -
tions’ estimates is different, however. Revisions to the output gap for years in the more distant 
past are only somewhat smaller than adjust -
ments at the current end and generally still 
have a discernible impact.
The question remains as to what causes the international organisations’ revisions to esti -mates in the distant past. One hypothesis 
would be that the statistical agencies shift the time path of real GDP upwards or downwards. 
The trend output extracted using a statistical smoothing procedure would then follow this 
level adjustment quasi-  automatical ly, meaning 
that the gap based on the HP filter would 
 remain unaffected. However, if the IMF and 
OECD did not revise their assessment of the 
potential output path, they would have to cor -
rect their capacity utilisation time series accord -
ingly.23 Yet this scenario seems unlikely, if only 
because – all other things being equal – a par -
allel shift of potential output would appear 
 logical if the level of real GDP is corrected. In 
addition, revisions to historical GDP data tend 
to be small. Alternatively, the adjustments to 
the output gaps could be caused by the inter -
national organisations’ reassessments regard -
ing the paths of potential output. To decide which of these competing hypotheses is cor -Long historical

21 Here, we prefer a simple arithmetic mean across coun -
tries to a weighted average, as we are interested in the 
typical revision rather than the aggregate one. In an aggre -
gate analysis based, for example, on nominal GDP weights, 
the US output gap would always have a dominant influ -
ence.
22 When a smoothing parameter of 100 is assumed, the 
revisions to the estimates based on the HP filter are initially somewhat larger than in the specification preferred in this 
analysis. In addition, they remain considerable for some -
what longer as the intervening period increases.23 Koske and Pain use a similar line of argument (2008).Deutsche Bundesbank

rect, the contributions of the corrections of 
 actual and potential GDP to the output gap 
 revision need to be identified. Yet a breakdown 
of this kind is not possible for the real variables, 
as, for conceptual reasons, their levels are not 
always comparable and the necessary differ -
ences therefore cannot be calculated.24 How -
ever, whether the gap expressed as a percent-
age of potential output is related to real or 
nominal variables has no impact on the gap’s 
size. Revisions to nominal variables can easily 
be calculated in currency units and compared.25 
Such an analysis of nominal variables confirms 
the hypothesis that new estimates of the 
 potential output level by the international 
 organisations essentially cause the revisions to 
 output gaps, particularly in the distant past.
The susceptibility of initial estimates to revision 
provides some insight into the reliability of esti -
mates at the current end. Looking at the data 
of the international organisations, it becomes 
clear that the subsequent corrections to these 
initial estimates are not only large but also tend 
to be in the same direction. Thus, both the IMF 
and the OECD generally underestimated the 
output gap for the 1998-2010 period and re -
vised their estimates upwards in later rounds. 
The estimates based on the HP filter do not 
show a bias of this size.26 For example, the 
IMF’s estimates initially showed an underutilisa -
tion of capacity in the Italian economy for every 
single year between 1998 and 2006. By con -
trast, the output gaps for this period all had a 
positive sign in the October 2013 WEO, and 
some of the upward revisions were very large. 
For the 2000-02 period, the IMF ultimately 
published cyclical positions of +1½% to 2½% 
of potential output, compared with its initial estimates of -1¾% to -2½%. For Italy, the 
OECD even changed all of the negative output gaps estimated for the 1998-2008 period into 
positive ones. Another point to note is that 
even a very high initial estimate for underutil -
isation does not necessarily preclude a sharp 
subsequent  r evision. In the spring 1999 WEO, 
the IMF estimated Japan’s 1998 output gap at -5¾%, before revising it to only -1½% in its 
 autumn 2013 publication.
The tendency towards upward corrections be -
comes apparent when calculating the mean of 
the revisions to initial estimates across the 1998-2010 period. As these upward revisions are not offset by downward corrections of a 
similar size, there are fairly high mean upward 
revisions to the international organisations’ es -
timates for most of the G7 economies. Indeed, 
they often come close to the mean absolute 
revision which disregards the sign. The IMF’s 
estimates for the United States and the OECD’s 
estimates for Japan are the only exceptions to 
this rule. By contrast, the mean revision to the 
initial estimates based on the HP filter is not 
generally as high in relation to the correspond -

24 Instead, Koske and Pain (2008) decompose the revision 
to the change in the output gap into the revision to the growth rates for real actual GDP and the revision to the 
growth rates for real potential GDP . They conclude that the 
revisions to the change in the output gap are due to a 
greater extent to corrections to actual GDP growth. How -
ever, it is important to emphasise that this issue is separate 
from the matter of explaining the revisions to the output 
gap level. For example, if there is simply a parallel upward 
or downward shift of the estimated time path for the 
 potential output path, this does generally alter the level of 
the output gap, but output gap changes from one period 
to the next remain entirely unaffected. See I Koske and 
N Pain (2008), op cit.
25 For the euro-  ar ea countries under review (Germany, 
France and Italy), the data for the period before the launch of the euro can be provided on a uniform basis using the fixed conversion rates. Generally, nominal potential GDP is derived from nominal actual GDP and the output gap.
26 If a smoothing parameter of 100 is used, the bias is 
somewhat larger than in the HP filter specification pre -
ferred in our analysis, but it still tends to be smaller than 
that affecting the international organisations’ estimates. Koske and Pain (2008) already observed that revisions to 
the OECD’s initial estimates were not random but generally 
had a substantial bias, while revisions using the HP filter 
were not biased to the same degree. However, it is import-ant to note that they define the revision merely as the dif -
ference between the estimates in the first and fourth year 
after the reference period for the output gap. The esti -
mates in the fourth year after the reference period are by no means “final” OECD estimates, which means that sub -
sequent corrections are omitted from the analysis. In add -
ition, Kempkes (2014) finds that international institutions’ 
(IMF, OECD and European Commission) estimates of out -
put gaps for EU countries for the current year and the fol -
lowing year have frequently been too negative. However, 
the study finds that estimates derived from the HP filter 
often have a similar bias, which is probably due in part to 
the influence of the underlying real GDP projections. See 
I Koske and N Pain (2008) op cit, and G Kempkes (2014),

Time Bias for EU-15 countries, Finanzarchiv, forthcoming.Deutsche Bundesbank

ing figure calculated when the signs are disre -
garded. This is mainly because the HP filter pro -
cedure, with its endpoint bias, also generates 
downward revisions. Yet the upward correc -
tions are greater in number, particularly in 2007 and 2008. The upward corrections to the inter -
national organisations’ estimates are not clus -
tered in a similar fashion around a cyclical peak. Instead, the bias affecting their initial estimates 
appears to be more of a general problem.
One possible explanation could be the trend 
towards slower GDP growth in the major 
 industrial countries during the period under 
 review. If the IMF and the OECD had been 
 hesitant to recognise this change, they might 
initially have wrongly interpreted the deceler -
ation of macroeconomic growth as a cyclical 
problem.27 This would be consistent with the 
fact that, in the OECD publications prior 
to 1999 for which databases are available, the initial estimates of the US output gap were too 
high. At that time, potential growth in the 
United States had accelerated unexpectedly. In 
the United Kingdom too, trend growth had 
strengthened around the mid-1990s, but the 
OECD did not subsequently perform consistent 
downward revisions on its initial estimates of 
the UK output gap. The international organisa -
tions’ corrections to their estimates of the earl -
ier level of potential output may be even more important than their revisions to trend growth 
in the past few years. As shown previously, 
level adjustments of this kind can lead to far-  
reaching revisions of past output gap esti-
mates.
How the international organisations change 
their appraisals of the path of potential output 
in response to recessions is likely to be an im -
portant factor in this context. If an observed

27 This is also surmised by Kempkes (2014). By contrast, 
Koske and Pain (2008) point to the impact of revisions to 
actual GDP on HP filter-  based estimates of trend output. As 
explained above, however, this does not tally with the 
international organisations’ extensive corrections to nom -
inal potential output. See I Koske and N Pain (2008), op cit,

purely temporary phenomenon, this implies a 
large underutilisation of capacity. Yet if the 
economy does not recover swiftly, thus making a return to the earlier growth trend an increas -
ingly distant prospect, the path of potential output might be lowered at the current end. 
The organisations may then come to realise 
that macroeconomic developments prior to the 
recession were not sustainable, and might also 
revise the level of potential output in previous 
years downwards while raising the output gap throughout.
These kinds of considerations appear to have 
informed the actions of the OECD in particular 
in connection with the 2008-09 global reces-
sion. In its March 2009 Interim Report, the OECD left the 2007 output gap for its entire economic area unchanged on its December 
2008 estimate (+1%), while forecasting a very 
high level of underutilisation for 2009 (-6½%) 
and 2010 (-8½%). When the world economy 
appeared to be on the road to recovery in 
spring 2009, the OECD debated whether it 
should stick to its previous hypothesis of a 
“bust without boom”.28 By contrast, mechanis-
tic application of the OECD’s usual method, in 
which statistical filters are applied to at least 
some of the time series which feed into the 
production function approach and are extrapo -
lated, would, in retrospect, have shown a 
marked boom prior to the crisis. For quarterly 
data, the output gap would then have peaked 
below +4%, before falling to just short of -4%. 
At that time, the OECD opted for the middle 
road of raising its estimate for the 2007 output 
gap moderately to +1¾% while projecting 
underutilisation amounting to 5¼% of poten -
tial output for 2009. Subsequently, however, 
the OECD continued to intensively investigate 
the impact of the crisis on the trend path of aggregate output in the advanced econ -
omies.
29 In its autumn 2013 EO, it put the 
OECD output gap at +3¼% in 2007 and -3¾% 
in 2009, which is probably fairly close to the 
figures in its earlier alternative scenario.The IMF recently markedly revised its output gap figures for France spanning an extended period of time, possibly for similar reasons.
30 
Compared with its spring publication, the IMF’s autumn 2013 WEO raised the estimates for the 
utilisation of aggregate capacity by 1¼ per -
centage points on average over the 2000-12 period. However, the data on actual real 
GDP were corrected only slightly, and solely for 
very recent years. The upward revision to the 
output gap is therefore mostly due to a corres -
ponding reduction in the estimated potential output. For 2007, the peak of that business 
cycle, the IMF now reports a substantial overu -
tilisation amounting to 2½% of potential out -
put, having previously estimated only a small 
positive output gap (+¾%).… by the

Implications and conclusion
The international organisations’ tendency to 
occasionally re-  estimate paths of potential  
 output spanning long periods of time means 
that the resulting output gaps may be revised 
even decades on. It is therefore questionable 
whether the IMF and OECD figures possess the 
qualities of “final” estimates, upon which em -
pirical analyses often rely. For example, the two 
institutions’ estimates of the US output gap in 2002, which is likely to have played an import -
ant role in the 2003 deflation debate,
31 do not 
appear to converge towards a given figure. In 
addition, the size and bias of the revisions to initial estimates of potential output and the 
output gap show that, particularly at the cur -
rent end, the IMF and OECD figures are subject to great uncertainty.
It is therefore important to be cautious about 
using the estimates to assess economic policy, for example.32 Looking at monetary policy, the 
average range of just under 3 percentage 
points for the IMF estimates of the US output 
gap between 1998 and 2010 would, for ex -
ample, imply a band of 1½ percentage points 
for the appropriate policy rate when applying 
the Taylor rule with its original 50-50 weighting 
of the target deviations for inflation and out -
put.33
The bias in the international organisations’ real-  
time estimates could have had tangible reper -
cussions if their data had been used in the con -
text of fiscal rules. Simulations for selected EU 
countries show that this would have led to sig -
nificant unintended increases in general gov -
ernment debt ratios (see box on pages 33 and 34). One option for dealing with a bias of this 
kind in the cyclical adjustment procedure for 
general government deficits would be to set up 
a “business cycle compensation account”. If, 
after an extended period, this account showed 
that the cyclical components did not offset 
each other on average over time, the permitted scope for borrowing could be widened or nar -
rowed accordingly.
The deceleration in major industrial countries’ 
trend growth in recent decades is evident and, 
not least given their increasing demographic 
change, also plausible. Estimates of the level of 
potential output are a prerequisite for assessing 
capacity utilisation. One possible conclusion

The impact of biased potential output estimates 
within fi  scal rules
Estimates of the output gap also play an 
 important role in the analysis of public  fi  nances and in the context of budgetary 
rules. They can be used to assess the impact 
of the economic cycle on public fi  nances. Adjustment for cyclical factors (known as 
cyclical adjustment) is a key stage in deter-mining the “structural” position of the gov-
ernment budget. Both the German debt 
brake and the Stability and Growth Pact are 
based on cyclically- adjusted variables. This 
is intended to keep public debt at sustain-
able levels, whilst also allowing the auto-
matic stabilising effect of cyclically induced 
changes in the fi  scal balance. Specifi  cally, 
budgetary rules designed to limit the build- 
up of debt are based on the idea that the 
cyclical components identifi  ed are largely 
symmetrical in the longer term. This will, it is hoped, ensure that negative cyclical com-
ponents in recessions and positive cyclical 
components in booms largely balance each other out, and thus debt caused by cyclical 
components does not accumulate system-
atically over time.
Because the cyclical factors cannot be ob-
served directly and are not clearly quantifi  -
able using a generally accepted method, they must be estimated on the basis of the infor-mation available using a procedure deemed 
to be appropriate (see also main article  beginning on page 13). In the cyclical ad-justment method which is currently used 
for the European Stability and Growth Pact 
and the German government’s national debt rule, the cyclical component is the 
product of the macroeconomic output gap and the average responsiveness of the gov-
ernment budget to this gap (budget sensi-
tivity). Budget sensitivity therefore measures 
the impact of cyclical fl  uctuations in gross  domestic product (GDP) on the fi  scal bal-ance. It is assumed to be constant over time and is only revised intermittently. In order to fulfi  l the symmetry criteria described above, 
negative and positive output gaps which 
are used to calculate the cyclical compon-
ents must therefore neutralise each other 
over time.
Output gap estimates are subject to consid-
erable uncertainty, especially at the current end, and are often revised signifi  cantly at a 
later date. This is unavoidable since ex-pected future developments play a crucial role in calculating an economy’s cyclical 
situation at the current end. If these expect-ations prove to be incorrect, the assessment 
for the earlier years also changes retro-spectively. In terms of the objectives of 
budgetary rules, this can pose a problem if the procedure for estimating potential out-
put is basically symmetrical but the macro-
economic outlook is regularly assessed too 
favourably at the time the estimation is 
made. Calculations would thus largely show cyclical underutilisation, which would justify the resulting cyclical defi  cits. Because these defi  cits would not be offset by correspond-
ing cyclical surpluses (and subsequent revi-
sions are not usually taken into account 
under the rules), this bias would involve an undesirable accumulation of debt.
Over the last 15 years, the output gaps for 
many countries in fact show a negative bias as estimated in real time by international or-
ganisations.1 In other words, the cyclical 
1 Specifi  cally, “real time” refers to the estimate that 
would have been relevant to the fi  scal plan in the con-
text of the aforementioned budget rules. For example, 
the estimate from the autumn of the year preceding 
the budget year is generally used when the Bundestag 
approves the Federal budget. During the approval of 
the budget plan for 2013, compliance with the debt 
brake was assessed using estimates of potential output from autumn 2012.Deutsche Bundesbank

position in many countries was systematic-
ally estimated too pessimistically in real time 
(ie potential output was overestimated).2 If 
these real- time estimates had been used in the context of a fi  scal rule such as the debt 
brake for the German central government, 
the actual scope for borrowing would have been systematically higher than the rule in-tended.
The quantitative signifi  cance of this real- time bias for debt ratios can be illustrated 
using simulations.3 The data set used here 
includes output gaps estimated by the 
OECD, the IMF and the European Commis-sion. Between 12 and 15 EU member states 
are observed over a period of 10 to 17 
years. In each case, real- time data from the autumn of the previous year are compared with the spring 2013 estimations of the in-stitution in question.
For the OECD data, the simulations show that, in itself, debt in the amount of the 
real- time cyclical fi  scal balances would have caused a relatively high increase in the debt 
ratio in the magnitude of 15 percentage points (unweighted cross- country average over a period of 17 years, from 1996 to 2012). For most of the countries, these 
effects are statistically signifi  cantly different from zero. The simulations carried out using IMF data produce a similar result. They pro-
duce an increase in the debt ratio in the 
magnitude of 10 percentage points within 
12 years (2001 to 2012), and the effects are 
also largely signifi  cant. EU data are only 
available for a shorter period (2003 to 2012), and the simulations for these show quanti-
tatively weaker results. The effects are also 
less signifi  cant. However, the results of 
these simulations also indicate that the bias of the cyclical components leads to an aver-
age debt ratio increase of 6 percentage 
points.If the real- time output gap as estimated by the OECD, IMF and the European Commis-
sion had been used for cyclical adjustment 
under fi  scal rules, this would have resulted 
in considerably higher debt ratios than the 
rules intended.4
All in all, the simulations illustrate the risk that fi  scal rules referring to cyclically ad-
justed fi  scal balances may fail to curb debt as desired because potential output is regu-larly overestimated. To ensure that levels of 
new borrowing are not systemically too high compared to the target set by the budget rules, potential biases in the real- 
time cyclical components should therefore 
be taken into account separately. This could 
be done by keeping a record of each cyc-
lical component used to assess compliance 
with the rules. The debt brake in the Ger-
man Land Hesse, for example, provides for 
a control account for the real- time cyclical 
components (Konjunkturausgleichskonto). 
If after an extended period, say a full eco-
nomic cycle (eg eight to ten years), the cyc-
lical components do not turn out to be 
roughly balanced on average, the borrow-
ing limit for the subsequent period could be 
raised or lowered accordingly. Such a cor-
rection mechanism would be relatively easy 
to implement and would automatically be-
come less important if estimates became 
more precise or estimation errors were sym-metrical.

rules: some evidence on real- time bias for EU-15 coun-
tries, Finanzarchiv, forthcoming.4 In the case of the EU production function, the effect of the bias on the debt ratio is not statistically signifi  -
cantly different from zero for Germany. Furthermore, 
revisions of the cyclical factors after the budget out-
turn also have an impact on the central government’s 
borrowing possibilities in the context of the national debt rule. This general discussion therefore does not 
allow direct conclusions to be drawn about the effect of the bias in this context.Deutsche Bundesbank

downturn seen in 2008 and 2009 is that the 
paths of potential output estimated before 
economic activity plummeted were overly opti -
mistic for a large number of advanced econ -
omies. Consequently, earlier growth paths are 
probably no longer achievable, particularly for 
some European countries. Substantial macro -
economic imbalances built up in these coun -
tries in the years prior to the global economic 
downturn and unwound during the crisis, and 
painful adjustment processes are now under -
way.34 Attempts to explain this merely through 
a major shortfall in aggregate demand are far 
from convincing. If these explanations are 
based on the international institutions’ output 
gap figures, it is important to remember that 
these estimates are subject to great uncertainty and the staff of these organisations revise their perception of the capacity available to an econ -
omy only gradually.
There is a general awareness of the difficulty of 
reliably estimating potential output and the 
output gap, particularly in the past few years. 
This is illustrated, not least, by the ongoing de -
bate among national and international institu -tions about the impact of the crisis on long-  
term economic developments and about the 
causes of incorrect estimates in the past.35 Eco-
nomic policy should take account of the uncer -
tainty about the current cyclical position – for 
instance, by drawing on the results of various 
procedures for calculating the output gap or by 
using alternative indicators. In the process of 
estimating price and cost pressures, measures 
which are less prone to revision, such as wage 
settlements or inflation expectations, could be 
a useful tool.

35 For example, Bouis et al (2012) show that, with the 
 exception of the United States, the negative output gaps 
recorded by the OECD for the major advanced economies 
at the current end are mainly due to the fact that actual total factor productivity (TFP) remained below potential 
TFP . As actual TFP is itself the residual of an estimate, how -
ever, Bouis et al consider uncertainty about potential TFP to be especially high. See R Bouis, B Cournède and A K Chris-

Implications of the Eurosystem’s monetary 
operations during the financial crisis
During the course of the financial and sovereign debt crisis the quantity, quality and character of 
the Eurosystem’s monetary policy refinancing operations, which are the core instruments used for 
steering short-  term inter est rates in the money market, changed significantly. Since the autumn of 
2008, the Eurosystem has granted banks loans in the desired volumes at a fixed interest rate 
(fixed-  r ate full allotment procedure). Moreover, the Eurosystem has occasionally made these 
funds available to banks with – in some cases – very long maturities. These non-  standar d meas -
ures reflect, inter alia, the ECB Governing Council’s endeavours to ensure that the prerequisites for both the supply of credit and monetary policy transmission were fulfilled, even at the height of the financial crisis, and, given the sharp recession that subsequently ensued in 2009, to combat 
the threat of a broad-  based cr edit crunch. However, these and other crisis-  induc ed changes in the 
use of instruments for steering money market rates constitute a precedent. The Eurosystem is no longer merely steering liquidity and interest rates in the interbank money market: it is taking part in the funding of banks, its influence even extending to capital market maturities.
The short-  term stabilisation effects of the non-  standar d measures have been achieved at the 
expense of side-  effects whic h gain in significance the longer the non-  standar d measures are used. 
The long-  term pr ovision of funds and fixed-  r ate full allotment in refinancing operations combined 
with the lowering of the credit quality threshold for eligible assets and the narrowing of the inter -
est rate corridor reduce the incentive for the banking and financial system to make much-  needed 
adjustments, and so tend to delay normalisation in the interbank money market. Over time, the collective effect of the various measures is to crowd out a part of private money and capital mar -
ket activity, to limit the disciplining of credit institutions by market forces and ultimately to distort competition between commercial banks.
The Eurosystem will not continue indefinitely to provide commercial banks with a generous supply 
of funding which the banks themselves often cannot obtain in the market at similar conditions. 
There is at present no indication that the non-  standar d measures introduced in response to the 
crisis will be discontinued. Looking to the future, however, it would be desirable if participants in monetary policy refinancing operations also had access to the interbank money market as a mat -
ter of principle. Moreover, money market transactions and liquidity-  pr oviding monetary policy 
operations need to become, from the institutions’ perspective, at least approximate substitutes. On the path to reverting to a method of steering money market rates that is more in line with the market, the Eurosystem will sooner or later have to improve incentives for money market activity, 
limit the allotment volume for liquidity-  pr oviding operations and bring the credit standards and 
haircuts for eligible marketable assets into line with market practice.
The assessment of banks’ balance sheets, which is currently being carried out before the ECB 
assumes responsibility for the Single Supervisory Mechanism, will support the normalisation of 
banks’ refinancing behaviour and bolster confidence on the money and financial markets. In the 
process, weaknesses may and must be revealed in the balance sheets of the institutions being 
examined, the need for action identified and decisions prepared regarding necessary capital 
measures or, if applicable, the resolution of institutions.Deutsche Bundesbank

Monetary policy stance, 
 conduct of monetary policy 
and the market conformity 
requirement
Whereas in the early years of monetary union 
the general public mainly only took note of the 
ECB Governing Council’s interest rate decisions, 
decisions about the conduct of monetary pol -
icy likewise met with public interest following 
the onset of the financial crisis. Since the liquid -
ity crisis began, the Eurosystem has repeatedly emphasised the conceptual separation of these 
two decision-  making levels –  first, with deci -
sions on the appropriate monetary policy stance, notably the key interest rate, and 
second, on the selection and design of liquidity operations in the context of implementing the monetary policy stance –, referring to it as the “separation principle”.
1
At the heart of this principle lies the idea that 
crisis-  i nduced non-  standard liquidity-  providing 
measures which are implemented in the con -
text of steering money market interest rates 
should not be seen as monetary policy easing 
as an end in itself. Instead, their aim should be for the monetary policy stance that is set by the 
ECB Governing Council and transmitted 
through the financial system to have an impact 
on the real economy – ie the consumption, 
saving and investment decisions of households and firms. Following on from this idea, even in 
the presence of non-  standar d monetary policy 
measures the monetary policy stance decided by the Governing Council is reflected by the main refinancing rate, the most important of the Eurosystem’s three key interest rates, in 
particular.2
In implementing monetary policy, the Eurosys -
tem has at its disposal the instruments specified 
in the Treaty on the Functioning of the Euro -
pean Union (TFEU) and the statute of the ECB. 
The instruments for steering short-  term inter est 
rates in the money market are described in 
more detail in the so-  cal led General Documen -
tation,3 which is supplemented by the monet -ary policy decisions which the Governing Coun-cil takes at regular intervals.
The aim behind steering short-  term interbank  
money market rates is to ensure that they are 
in line with the monetary policy stance set by 
the Governing Council. The main purpose of monetary policy refinancing operations in the 
euro area is to influence the banking system’s 
liquidity position vis-  à-  vis the Eur osystem, 
which is to say the aggregate volume of com-
mercial banks’ balances with the Eurosystem’s 
national central banks. This makes it possible to 
steer short-  term inter est rates in the interbank 
money market, in which commercial banks 
trade central bank balances with one another.
The Eurosystem’s monetary policy action must 
be geared to the primary objective of price sta -
bility at all times. Moreover, the Eurosystem is 
expected to support the general economic pol -
icies in the EU, provided that is possible with -
out prejudice to the price stability objective. However, the Eurosystem is subject to funda -
mental restrictions. For example, it is expressly 
forbidden for the Eurosystem to buy govern-
ment bonds on the primary market or to grant 
loans to general government (monetary finan -
cing prohibition). Furthermore, in conducting 
monetary policy the Eurosystem is required to 
act “in accordance with the principle of an 
open market economy with free competition”, Decisions about

promoting an efficient allocation of resources.4 
This principle also applies to the interaction of 
central banks with commercial banks and is a 
guiding principle in designing monetary policy 
regulations and instruments. Monetary policy 
should be as closely oriented to the market 
economy and free competition as possible, 
whereas interventionist designs of monetary policy instruments are exceptions requiring 
specific monetary policy justification.
For the Eurosystem, to act in accordance with 
the principle of an open market economy with 
free competition is not an end in itself, but 
serves the purpose of favouring an efficient al -
location of resources. Against the background 
of this fundamental principle, the implementa-
tion of monetary policy can be considered to 
be in conformity with the market if the general 
level of interest rates is steered effectively 
– thereby safeguarding price stability provided 
the monetary policy stance is suitably deter -
mined  – while simultaneously relative prices 
(interest rates or interest rate spreads) and the allocation of resources through the market are 
changed as little as possible. For instance, the 
main determinants of repo interest rates –  which include the type, credit quality and 
market liquidity of the collateral used, the credit 
standing of the counterparties involved, the 
 relationship between the repo rate and the 
 desired loan amount, as well as the maturity of 
the transactions  – should continue to play a part in determining banks’ funding costs. If 
possible, these mechanisms should be effective 
even when banks make use of central bank 
loans.
This article discusses how the Eurosystem’s op-
erations for steering money market rates were 
organised before and during the course of the 
financial crisis in terms of this market economy 
principle. It also examines proposals for the 
 design of monetary operations in a post-  crisis  
setting.Fundamentals of how the 
Eurosystem steers money market rates
The Eurosystem’s most important instruments 
for steering short-  term inter est rates in the 
money market include the monetary policy refi-
nancing operations –  main refinancing oper -
ations (MROs) and longer-  term r efinancing 
 operations (LTROs) – and the standing facilities 
(deposit facility and marginal lending facility).5 
Through its counterparty policy and the collat-
eral framework, the Eurosystem stipulates 
which credit institutions may take part in mon -
etary policy operations and the collateral eligi -
bility requirements they have to meet.
Refinancing operations
In the past, the euro-  ar ea banking system con -
sistently showed a structural liquidity deficit vis-  
à- vis the Eurosystem. In other words, there was 
a high aggregate need for liquidity-  pr oviding 
monetary policy operations which was covered, 
for the most part, by central bank loans that 
were offered on a revolving basis: the monet -
ary policy refinancing operations. These are in -
tended both to steer liquidity and interest rates 
in the market and to provide signals regarding 
the monetary policy stance. The once-  weekly  
MROs play a pivotal role in this connection. The 
minimum bid rate or fixed rate that applies to 
these operations is the most important of the 
three key interest rates. On the other hand, the

 reserve requirement for credit institutions, which fulfils an 
important operational and technical function in steering money market rates, but because it does not pose any 
problems in terms of the market conformity requirement, it 
is not featured prominently in this article for reasons of 
simplicity. The same applies to liquidity-  absorbing or liquid -
ity- pr oviding fine-  tuning oper ations (mostly with a maturity 
of one day) which for a long time were offered on the last day of every maintenance period. Other instruments, such

purchases, are disregarded in this article.Deutsche Bundesbank

Underlying conditions and principles of how central banks 
steer money market rates
Steering money market rates
The major central banks of western coun-
tries steer money market rates in ways that 
sometimes differ quite markedly  – in line 
with the distinctive features of their own  fi  nancial systems as well as differing na-
tional customs and practices.
In English- speaking countries, for example, 
recourse to central bank loans was trad-itionally associated with a considerable stigma for banks. A commercial bank that had to take out a loan from the central 
bank ran the risk of being seen as not very sound – and of losing the confi  dence of its counterparties and, possibly, of its custom-
ers, too. This stigmatisation of recourse to 
central bank credit was refl  ected in the way the central banks concerned steered money 
market rates – for example, the fact that the aggregate liquidity requirements of the  banking system were predominantly covered by the central banks’ securities holdings or that liquidity operations were reserved for a limited group of the cen-tral bank’s counterparties, which, in turn,  assumed the function of safeguarding the 
horizontal distribution of liquidity within the 
banking sector through money market 
transactions.
Balance sheet structure of the 
central bank and the absolute interest rate level
The structure of central banks’ balance 
sheets as well as the absolute level of inter-est rates are also important underlying fac-
tors determining the precise way in which 
they steer money market rates. For ex-ample, the banking systems in countries where central banks have also purchased large amounts of securities over the past few years in pursuance of their monetary 
policy objectives now show a liquidity sur-
plus vis- à- vis the central bank in most cases. 
This takes the form of high central bank 
balances, while key interest rates are actu-
ally or approximately zero (eg Denmark, 
Japan, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United 
States). The need for regular liquidity- providing credit operations by the central 
banks is virtually non- existent in these coun-
tries and hardly any use is made of credit operations or the available credit facilities. The excess liquidity held by the banks on 
their accounts with the central banks often 
remain unremunerated as far they do not 
yield a slightly positive rate of interest (USA) 
or, in fact, draw a marginally negative rate 
(like in Denmark until April 2014). Short- 
term interest rates on the interbank money 
market are then guided by these very low 
key interest rates that apply to  excess cen-
tral bank liquidity.
Liquidity management and money 
 market rates
Given fairly high rates of infl  ation and growth, the key interest rates of most of the major central banks remained well in 
the positive range up to the fi  nancial crisis. 
Within the terms of the particular way in 
which they steer money market rates, cen-
tral banks usually aimed to anchor short- term money market rates for interbank 
trading close to an interest rate level set by 
the central bank monetary policy decision- 
making body. One particularly important factor in linking short- term money market rates closely to the key interest rate is a comparatively precise management of the Deutsche Bundesbank

banking system’s aggregate liquidity pos-
ition vis- à- vis the central bank, which can be gauged by the banks’ overnight bal-
ances at the central bank.
Fluctuations in the autonomous factors 
offset by liquidity operations
Autonomous factors – comprising, in par-
ticular, cash in circulation and government 
deposits at the central bank – are key deter-
minants of the banking system’s liquidity 
position.1 The central banks’ liquidity oper-
ations usually offset the changes in the au-
tonomous factors (creation of balanced  liquidity conditions) and thus enable the 
central bank to stabilise and steer the short- 
term interest rates. The structural liquidity requirements of the banking system, ie the  (net) sum of the necessary liquidity- providing monetary policy operations, otherwise merely refl  ect the structure and composition of the central bank’s balance 
sheet.
The central bank can fundamentally infl  u-
ence the banking system’s liquidity position 
by means of liquidity- providing and liquid-
ity- absorbing monetary policy operations. 
For example, the central bank can provide 
the banking system with liquidity by means of revolving loans or by outright purchases of securities. It can withdraw liquidity from 
the banking system, say, by selling secur-ities, which leads to a reduction of banks’ holdings at the central bank. Further pos-sible methods of absorbing liquidity (ie to reduce banks’ overnight deposits at the central bank) are, for instance, the collec-tion of remunerated fi  xed- term deposits 
from the banks and the central bank issuing its own debt instruments.Commercial banks’ current account holdings at central banks
Commercial banks’ current account hold-
ings at the central banks play an important role in the fi  nancial system, as a signifi  cant 
volume of payments are settled through them. The commercial banks must, as a general rule, have positive holdings or a balance of at least zero on these current  accounts. Mostly, however, intraday over-drafts are possible in the context of pay-ment transactions against the posting of 
suffi   cient collateral, and most central banks 
offer their counterparties the possibility of transferring negative account balances at 
the end of the day into a kind of overnight overdraft facility, for which, however, higher 
rates of interest are generally charged. Some central banks additionally require commercial banks to maintain minimum  reserves on their current accounts at the central bank, which then produce regular 
positive balances on those accounts. Non- 
compliance with a reserve requirement is 
typically subject to subsequent sanctions in the form of penalty interest.
If central banks aim to control short- term 
money market interest rates, they must pro-vide in aggregate at least as much in central 
bank reserves through liquidity operations 
for the commercial banks’ accounts at the 
central banks to amount in sum to at least 
zero and, additionally, fulfi  l any minimum 
reserve requirements that may exist. Other-
wise, money market rates may rise in an  uncontrolled way. If, however, the banks’ holdings at the central bank are clearly higher than is required in aggregate, the overnight interest rate in the interbank 
money market can, in principle, go down to 
1 Especially in the short term, the autonomous factors 
cannot be infl  uenced by the central banks and are 
therefore regarded as exogenous in the context of 
 liquidity management by the central banks.Deutsche Bundesbank

mately three months – as a means of signalling 
its monetary policy stance.
Standing facilities and interest 
rate corridor
When, at the end of a business day, banks have 
excess current account holdings with the Euro-system, they can place these funds “overnight” 
in the deposit facility. They normally receive a 
positive rate of interest on these funds – the deposit facility rate, which the Governing Council sets as one of the three key interest 
rates and is usually considerably lower than the minimum bid rate (or fixed rate) on MROs. Sim -
ply put, it is only worthwhile for banks to resort to the deposit facility if they are confident that they will be able to fulfil their minimum reserve requirement in the current maintenance period 
and if they cannot find any interbank money market counterparties that are in need of li -
quidity and are prepared to pay them an inter -est rate which, after deduction of any risk pre -
mium, is higher than the Eurosystem’s deposit 
facility rate.
If, on the other hand, banks need additional 
 liquidity at the end of a business day in order to 
balance their current account with the central 
bank or to meet their minimum reserve require -
ment, they can – on their own initiative and 
against the necessary collateral – use the Euro -
system’s marginal lending facility (for which there are, as a rule, no credit limits or other 
restrictions). To do so, they must pay the mar -
ginal lending rate. This, the third of the Euro -
system’s key interest rates, is usually consider -
ably higher than the MRO rate and the over-night rates on the interbank money market. The reason for this spread has to do with in -
centives: the marginal lending facility should 
neither obstruct the function of the interbank 
money market for the horizontal distribution of liquidity within the banking system, nor should 
it take the place of refinancing operations in Deposit facility:

against both eventualities in order to limit 
fl  uctuations in short- term money market 
rates (standing facilities).
Adjustment function of the 
money market
Commercial banks’ account holdings at the 
central banks fl  uctuate in the course of and 
as an outcome of banking business activ-
ity – consisting, for example, of payments, 
the collection of deposits, and the sale and 
acquisition of securities. Offsetting these 
fl  uctuations is the key role of the interbank 
money market, which ensures horizontal 
 liquidity adjustment within the banking sys-
tem. At the aggregate level, banks can 
make use of central bank loans as a substi-
tute for horizontal liquidity adjustment be-
tween banks only to the extent that the central bank offers this possibility to them on an exceptional or a regular basis – pro-
vided the banks satisfy the required ap-
proval criteria. If this is the case, the central 
bank’s balance sheet is extended beyond what is necessary and the central bank 
takes on a part of the intermediation pro-
cess between the commercial banks.Deutsche Bundesbank

covering the banking system’s aggregate 
 liquidity deficit. Thus, banks will consider using 
the marginal lending facility, in particular, in the 
event of an error in the management of funds or unexpected liquidity outflows at the end of a business day or, more generally, in situations 
in which a bank has unintentionally exhausted 
all other, less expensive sources of liquidity.
The signals given through the MRO rate about 
the monetary policy stance are complemented 
by the marginal lending rate and the deposit 
facility rate. The interest rate corridor between 
these two rates limits fluctuations in short-  term 
money market rates, thereby protecting banks, 
within certain bounds, from being forced into 
transactions with very unfavourable conditions by other banks that occupy a stronger position in the interbank money market. In this way, the 
standing facilities help stabilise money market 
and liquidity conditions, even when they are not used by banks. The width of the interest 
rate corridor plays a large part in determining 
the incentives for money market activity, ie the 
horizontal distribution of liquidity between 
banks through the interbank money market.
Equal treatment of financially 
sound counterparties
The eligibility criteria for counterparties within 
the monetary policy framework are such that a 
broad range of institutions is given access to 
Eurosystem monetary policy operations and 
equal treatment of institutions is enhanced 
throughout the euro area. The authorised insti-
tutions must be financially sound. Individual 
counterparties may be denied access to monet-
ary policy operations on the grounds of pru -
dence. A more moderate option open to the 
Eurosystem is to refuse, or limit the acceptance 
of, certain counterparties’ collateral. Generally 
speaking, counterparties may be excluded, in 
particular, if they fail to meet basic regulatory 
requirements, for instance with regard to cap -
ital adequacy, and cannot therefore be con -
sidered financially sound.The Eurosystem requires its counterparties to 
provide “adequate collateral” (see Article 18.1 
of the Statute of the ECB) for liquidity-  pr oviding 
monetary policy operations – in particular, refi -
nancing operations and the marginal lending 
facility – as well as for intraday credit needed to 
settle payments. In practice, the Eurosystem 
 accepts a wide range of marketable and non-  
marketable assets (in particular, interest-  bearing 
securities and credit claims). Essentially, the eli -
gibility criteria for assets have been harmonised 
throughout the euro area. The main purpose of 
the collateralisation of the Eurosystem’s credit 
operations is to protect it from financial risks in 
the event of default by monetary policy coun-
terparties. Moreover, haircuts are applied pri-
marily on the basis of the rating (or, in the case 
of credit claims, a rating equivalent) and add -
itionally, in the case of marketable securities, 
according to the Eurosystem’s liquidity cat -
egory for a specific type of security.
It is not the purpose of the monetary policy re -
financing operations and the collateral frame -
work to establish an independent credit policy 
of the Eurosystem. The principle of an open 
market economy with free competition obliges 
the Eurosystem to be neutral with regard to the 
accepted collateral. This means that the criteria 
for the acceptance of collateral and the calcu -
lation of haircuts are based, as a general prin -
ciple, on risk criteria (credit risk, market liquidity of the collateral). The stipulation that collateral 
must be “adequate” represents minimum re-
quirements for the credit quality and unhin -
dered realisability of the accepted collateral, 
requirements which must not be undershot. 
However, the Eurosystem is at liberty to adjust 
the credit quality threshold upwards on the basis of monetary policy considerations. As a 
general principle, the Eurosystem is under no 
obligation to refinance certain claims or secur -
ities through revolving credit operations.Interest rate cor-

Monetary operations  
prior to the financial crisis
Design of the instruments
Up until the outbreak of the financial crisis in 
September 2008, the Eurosystem conducted 
the weekly MROs as competitive tender oper -
ations with a limited allotment volume. From 
June 2000, it made use of a variable-  r ate ten -
der procedure, in which the minimum bid rate for the bids submitted acted as the “key inter -
est rate”. From the introduction of the euro in 
January 1999 until the summer of 2007, the Eurosystem conducted monthly LTROs with a 
maturity of around three months to provide an 
average of roughly one-  quarter of the out -
standing refinancing volume. From the outset, 
the Eurosystem used variable-  r ate tenders with -
out a minimum bid rate for LTROs, as it did not 
wish to signal its monetary policy stance 
through these operations.6
To improve the prospects of being allotted the 
desired amount of central bank credit in the 
variable-  r ate tender procedure, banks have to 
bid higher interest rates, which they then have 
to pay if the bid is successful. Under this 
“American auction” procedure, it is in the bid -
ders’ own interest that they do not submit ex -
cessively high bids. The average interest costs 
(weighted average allotment rate) of the rates 
at which bids are satisfied usually lie above the 
marginal allotment rate, but do not substan -
tially exceed it under normal circumstances.
When competitive bidding procedures such as 
the variable-  r ate tender procedure are used, 
the individual bidders can never be completely 
sure –  given that the allotment volume is limited and not knowing the other banks’ 
bids – whether and in what amount their bids will be successful. Normally they have to resort 
to the interbank money market for any funds 
they are unable to obtain. In the context of the 
variable-  r ate tender procedure with limited 
 allotment amounts, it is therefore important 
that banks maintain market access to be able to refinance themselves at favourable terms on the money market.
Individual institutions which are unable under these conditions to obtain the liquidity they 
need either in the market or through the regu -
larly conducted monetary policy refinancing 
operations have to turn to the marginal lending facility. Throughout the period from April 1999 
to the beginning of October 2008 the interest 
rate corridor between the rates for the mar -
ginal lending facility and the deposit facility 
was symmetrical around the MRO rate, with a 
width of ±100 basis points (bp).
Market conditions and the 
 results/effects of the monetary 
operations
It can be assumed that the overwhelming ma -
jority of euro-  ar ea banks had sustainable access 
to the interbank money market from 1999. The 
institutions considered credit transactions with 
each other to be largely risk-  fr ee. This is sug -
gested,  inter alia,  by the – for long periods – 
virtually constant and very small spreads be -
tween unsecured and secured money market 
rates.7 As a rule, banks traded central bank bal -
ances with a limited number of counterparties. The interbank money market was characterised by stable network structures and by a relatively small number of banks that assumed a particu -
larly important role in liquidity distribution.

refinancing operations involving a limited allot -
ment volume that were offered under the vari -

a list of bids in descending order of the offered interest 
rates until the allotment volume is precisely exhausted. The 
lowest interest rate at which amounts are allotted is re -
ferred to as the “marginal allotment rate”.7 In retrospect, banks’ risk perception prior to the financial crisis may appear inadequate.

lowing liquidity and money market conditions 
from the time the euro was introduced until 
the financial crisis broke out.
– Through its monetary policy refinancing op-
erations the Eurosystem provided, on the 
whole, precisely sufficient liquidity to ensure 
that the banking system’s aggregate liquid -
ity needs per maintenance period – which 
consist of the autonomous factors (see the 
box on pages 40 to 42) and the minimum 
reserve requirement  – were covered. The 
average level of excess liquidity per mainten -
ance period, which can be measured in 
terms of average recourse to the deposit 
 facility plus the banks’ current account hold -
ings with the Eurosystem in excess of the 
reserve requirement, was extremely low 
compared with the outstanding refinancing 
volume or reserve requirement.
– The interest rate corridor with a width of 
±100 bp provided strong incentives for pri -
vate money market activity, and thus safe -
guarded the horizontal distribution of 
 liquidity through the interbank money mar -
ket. Before the collapse of Lehman Brothers the volume of recourse to the deposit facility 
and marginal lending facility as a long-  term 
average over the maintenance periods was 
less than €1 billion in each case (see the 
above chart); this was only a tiny fraction of 
the refinancing volume or reserve require -
ment. In a nutshell, banks did not make sys -
tematic use of the standing facilities until 
the height of the financial crisis.
– On balance, the Eurosystem succeeded in 
steering short-  term money market rates ef -
fectively. With regard to the mean deviations 
of the short-  term money market r ates from 
the key interest rate as well as their fluctu -
ations, for quite some time the Eurosystem 
was at least as successful in this respect as 
other major central banks. The Eurosystem’s 
steering of money market rates sometimes 
served as a role model for other central banks wishing to enhance their own oper -
ations for steering money market rates.9
One side-  effect of using refinancing operations 
with limited allotment amounts to steer short-  
term interest rates was that the total assets re-
ported in the consolidated financial statement 
of the Eurosystem were no greater than neces -
sary, taking as given the prevailing level of au -
tonomous factors and the reserve requirement. 
Thus, limited allotment amounts contributed to 
keeping the financial risks assumed by the 
 Eurosystem and the associated redistribution 
effects confined to a relatively small scope dur -
ing the time before the financial crisis.
Liquidity crisis:  
harbinger of the financial crisis
In the run-  up to the financial crisis the variable-  
rate tender procedure proved capable of adapt -
ing to changing market conditions. The strong 
demand by banks which grew increasingly 
 dependent on their successful participation in 
monetary policy refinancing operations caused 
an increase in the weighted average rate on Balanced liquid-ity conditions: virtually no

MROs (in relation to the minimum bid rate) 
from the onset of the liquidity crisis in August 
2007. The spread between the weighted aver -
age rate and the marginal allotment rate like -
wise widened over time. The widening of this 
interest rate spread points to a decline in the 
uniformity of interest rates in the interbank money market during that time, and can be seen as a stress barometer for the interbank 
money market in the same way as the increase 
in money market risk premia10 (see the above 
chart).
Thus, the American-  st yle variable-  r ate tender 
procedure ensured that, before the financial 
crisis, banks’ funding costs with the Eurosystem 
reflected at least to some degree the diver-
gence between the short-  term funding costs of 
sound and less sound banks in the market. Generally speaking, therefore, this procedure can be considered largely in line with market 
conditions: banks whose market access deteri -
orates are forced to bid more aggressively in refinancing operations. As a result, their mar -
ginal funding costs with the Eurosystem in -
crease, as does the willingness of banks to pay higher rates of interest for money market loans. 
In this way, the variable-  r ate tender procedure 
gives banks a certain incentive to implement, 
on their own initiative, confidence-  bu ilding 
measures – such as strengthening their capital base or reducing the extent of their maturity 
transformation – in order to maintain their ac -
cess to the money market.
The growing pressure on the interbank money 
market in the euro area in the course of the 
 liquidity crisis11 was also reflected in rising inter -
est rate spreads between unsecured and 
 secured money market operations. It grew in -
creasingly difficult to conclude unsecured 
money market transactions, particularly in longer maturities, and on the repo market 
there was a growing trend towards accepting 
only higher-  quality col lateral.12 This presented a 
challenge to the Eurosystem’s steering of 
money market rates in that, given market par -
ticipants’ increasing risk awareness, unsecured 
money market rates such as EURIBOR showed 
an upward tendency in relation to the key 
interest rate. Doubts as to the controllability of 
short-  term money market rates by the Eurosys -
tem seemed to grow as a result. However, al -

–  such as full allotment in refinancing oper -
ations – cannot, at least, improve the clarity of 
the monetary policy signal given the respective state of the interbank money market, and may even make it worse. With regard to the effect -
iveness of monetary policy and the appropriate 
monetary policy stance, rising money market 
risk premia can in any case generally be com -
pensated by cuts in the key interest rate if, 
otherwise, there are reasons to fear an un -
desired tightening of monetary policy. The 
 Eurosystem’s two-  pil lar strategy13 provides a 
coherent framework to enable this to happen.
One factor that helped to escalate tensions 
prior to the financial crisis was that, in line with 
heightened risk awareness, different banks in -
creasingly had to pay different interest rates on 
the money market. Fewer and fewer banks 
were able to procure liquidity on the interbank 
money market in the previously accustomed 
amounts at (reference) interest rates like EURI -
BOR. In addition, access to the interbank money market deteriorated for a growing 
number of banks, because many institutions 
– prompted by higher risk awareness – were 
restricting existing credit lines for other banks 
or closing them completely. From the individual 
bank’s viewpoint, such risk-  mitigating meas -
ures are understandable. After all, it is the task 
of a bank’s risk management team to respond 
to changing risks. On the other hand, it is prob -
able that banks had assessed risks wrongly 
prior to the liquidity crisis by underestimating 
them overall.
First phase of the  
financial crisis 2008-09
The collapse of the US investment bank Lehman 
Brothers on 15 September 2008 may be seen 
as a watershed marking the transition from the 
liquidity crisis to the financial crisis. The already 
tense situation in the markets then escalated dramatically. In consequence, the Governing 
Council decided on 8 October 2008 that, start -
ing from the operation to be settled on 15 Oc -tober, MROs would be conducted as fixed-  r ate 
tenders with full allotment. This arrangement 
was subsequently extended to include LTROs as well. Moreover, on 9 October 2008 the interest rate corridor between the rates for the Eurosys-
tem’s marginal lending facility and deposit fa -
cility was narrowed from ±100 bp to ±50 bp 
around the main refinancing rate (the previous minimum bid rate on MROs). This measure was 
set to run until 20 January 2009. And finally, on 
17 October 2008, the rating threshold for eli -
gible collateral was lowered from A- to BBB- 
with effect from 22 October.
These decisive non-  s tandard monetary policy 
measures instantly made central bank loans 
significantly cheaper for all institutions than the 
money market rates recorded just a short time 
before. The full allotment in MROs and LTROs 
and the strong demand from institutions led to 
a first surge in excess liquidity from, previously, 
close to zero to over €200 billion on average in 
the fourth quarter of 2008. Thus, for the first 
time since the beginning of monetary union, 
there was no longer a shortage of banks’ cur -
rent account holdings with the central bank on 
the whole. Given this excess central bank 
 liquidity, short-  term interest rates on the inter -
bank money market fell considerably below the 
main refinancing rate (see chart on page 48). From that point at the latest, they could no 
longer be considered representative of banks’ 
marginal liquidity and funding costs: the de -
posit facility rate represented the opportunity 
costs associated with banks’ own excess liquid -
ity. Some of the banks which still had market 
access were in a position to satisfy their liquid -
ity shortage at money market rates below the 
main refinancing rate and above the Eurosys -
tem’s deposit facility rate. Those banks which 
were no longer able or no longer wanted to

rate in each case. When the interest rate corri-
dor was expanded again to the previously usual width of ±100 bp, the monetary policy refinan-
cing volume and excess liquidity fell sharply. 
 Between 20 January 2009 and 23 June 2009, 
excess liquidity averaged no more than some 
€65 billion.
In this first, critical phase of the financial crisis, 
the Eurosystem’s full allotment policy for refi -
nancing operations had broad-  b ased –  and 
very important  – stabilisation effects. They 
meant that banks whose liquidity situation had 
grown tense due to the crisis – including, in 
particular, those institutions that were affected 
by restrictions in horizontal liquidity adjustment through the interbank money market – largely did not have to dispose of assets in “fire sales” in order to obtain liquidity. This served to coun -
ter the possibility of a self-  r einforcing down -
ward spiral in securities prices, which could 
have done far greater damage to the financial sector, indirectly weighing on the real economy to an even greater extent as a result. Taken to -
gether, then, the non-  standar d monetary policy 
measures which the Eurosystem implemented 
in the autumn of 2008 reversed the trend of 
rapidly rising money market risk indicators (see chart on page 46).
In this respect the effect of the full allotment policy for refinancing operations was, in this 
phase of the financial crisis, similar to that of 
numerous liquidity programmes offered by the 
Federal Reserve to commercial banks and mar -
ket participants at around the same time. The 
Eurosystem´s broad range of counterparties 
and the broad collateral framework proved to 
be beneficial, as they meant that the entire 
banking system could be provided with liquid-ity directly. The banking system as a whole was 
consequently stabilised, and the possible col -
lapse of part of the financial system was 
averted. It is likely that these measures ultim -
ately also gave a considerable boost to banks’ 
ability to lend – which, of course, is one of the 
key functions they perform for the real econ -
omy – in the months and quarters that imme -
diately followed the collapse of Lehman Broth-
ers.

month intervals from 25 June 2009. Particularly 
the first of these three operations met with 
massive demand, the bidding and allotment 
volume totalling €442 billion. Accordingly, the 
outstanding refinancing volume rose sharply. 
Excess liquidity having fallen to low double-  
digit billion euro amounts over the months 
 before, it experienced a strong temporary in -
crease as a result of the extensive participation by banks in the first of the three 12-month ten-
ders. Encouraged by the incentive of the broader interest rate corridor, banks scaled 
back excess liquidity again in the course of the 
fourth quarter of 2009, however, by reducing 
their recourse to refinancing operations with a 
shorter maturity to well below €100 billion at 
times.
Following the allotment of the third 12-month 
tender in December 2009, excess liquidity 
again climbed to a level of more than €200 bil-
lion on average in the first half of 2010. With 
hindsight, the following factors may be con -
sidered relevant in this respect. The refinancing 
volume was largely dominated by the three 
outstanding 12-month tenders, the total vol -
ume of which, at more than €600 billion, for a time exceeded the structural liquidity deficit of 
the banking sector. The total volume of the 
shorter-  term oper ations was small by compari -
son. Moreover, the transition from financial  crisis to sovereign debt crisis occurred during 
this time, and is likely to have increased the de-
mand for liquidity. And not least of all, banks were also building up considerable liquidity 
buffers to be able to repay the tender amount of €442 billion that was due on 1 July 2010.
On 4  March 2010, the Governing Council 
stressed its determination to continue the exit 
from the liquidity-  pr oviding non-  standar d 
measures. The full allotment policy for the 
three-  month MROs was discontinued, and on  
28 April 2010 an LTRO with an indicative allot-
ment volume and a minimum bid rate was 
again offered in the variable-  r ate tender pro -
cedure for the first time. In terms of market economy principles, the operation was a suc -
cess. The bidders did not fully exhaust the en -
visaged allotment volume, while banks, having 
played safe by bidding very high interest rates 
because of their dependence on central bank 
loans, had to pay an interest rate spread aver -
aging 15 bp above the 1.0% minimum bid rate 
through this form of self-  selection. For this rea -
son, the – albeit temporary – return to a vari -
able-  r ate tender procedure meant a distinct im -
provement in market conformity compared 
with the fixed-  r ate full allotment in the case of 
the LTROs.Excess liquidity

European sovereign debt crisis 
after May 2010
The onset of the sovereign debt crisis in early 
May 2010 prompted the Eurosystem to unwind 
the steps it had already taken to discontinue its 
non- standar d liquidity-  pr oviding monetary pol -
icy measures. The exit process has remained on 
ice ever since. The Eurosystem has already 
promised banks that its refinancing operations will be allotted in full until mid-2015.
The uncomplicated and, for the most part, smooth repayment of the €442 billion tender 
on 1 July 2010 caused excess liquidity to recede suddenly and then decline further to consider -
ably less than €100 billion, before resuming an upward trajectory in summer 2011 on the back 
of growing pressure in the government bond 
and bank debt markets in a number of periph -
ery countries. One 12-month refinancing oper -
ation conducted at the end of October 2011 
still attracted relatively modest demand of €57 billion. The Governing Council then decided at the beginning of December 2011 to offer two 
more long-  term r efinancing operations, but 
this time with terms of roughly three years.
The three-  year L TROs were likewise conducted 
on a full allotment basis, but unlike the 12-month tenders in 2009 they each offered counterparties the option of early repayment after a minimum term of roughly one year. 
Taken together, the two operations generated 
a bidding and allotment volume of more than 
€1 trillion. These measures were decided 
against the background of the heightened un-
certainty observed in the financial markets since August 2011 given the prospect that a large volume of government bonds and bank debt needed to be rolled over in 2012.
15 The 
three-  year L TROs marked the Eurosystem’s de -
parture from the money market’s maturity spectrum and its first broad interventions in 
capital market maturities with the types of in -
struments normally used to steer money mar -
ket rates.The three-  year L TROs had a very substantial im -
pact on the money market and on the liquidity position of the banking sector. The allotment of 
the two three-  year tenders in late 2 011 and 
early 2012 drove excess liquidity sharply higher 
in two steps to roughly €775 billion in the 
second quarter of 2012, and it was only in the course of 2013 – when banks made use of the 
early repayment option – that volumes begin 
to contract sharply. With the two three-  year r e-
financing operations less than a year from ma -
turity in the first quarter of 2014, the remaining 
excess liquidity currently amounts to more than 
€100 billion. It should be noted, however, that 
the Eurosystem continues to offer weekly 
 liquidity-  absorbing oper ations currently total -
ling just over €170 billion.16 Hence, the Euro -
system balance sheet still overshoots by more 
than €270 billion the level required for bal -
anced liquidity conditions.
Money market risk indicators such as the 
spread between unsecured and secured inter -
bank money market rates (known as the depo-  
repo spread) have diminished steadily since 
peaking, relatively speaking, around the turn of 
2011/  2 012, not least on account of the large 
volume of excess liquidity created by the three-  
year LTROs. The persistent narrow spread of 
short-  term money market r ates over the Euro -
system’s deposit facility rate was a side-  effect  
of the very high level of excess liquidity. These 
operations produced, inter alia, two major out -
comes. First, they substantially relieved the 
funding situation for ailing banks; second, they stoked demand for paper such as government 
bonds, which were used for carry trades. At the 
end of the day, it was by easing funding for

16 The Eurosystem offers banks a once-  weekly liquidity-  
absorbing operation in the amount of the outstanding SMP 
(Securities Markets Programme) portfolio volume. This 
 operation was introduced alongside the SMP in May 2010

ery that the operations brought about improve -
ments in the money market risk indicators.
The year 2013 saw the main refinancing rate 
contracting in two further steps from 0.75% to 0.25% of late. So far, the Eurosystem has refrained from introducing a negative deposit facility rate, which has narrowed the interest 
rate corridor still further. Since November 2013, 
the spread between the main refinancing rate 
and the deposit facility rate has been no more than 25 bp.
Side-  effects of the liquidity-  
providing non-  standard 
 monetary policy measures
The high take-  up of the fixed-  r ate refinancing 
operations, some of which had very long terms, and the at times extremely high levels of excess 
liquidity illustrate how the Eurosystem, in the first case, on the assets side of its balance 
sheet, and in the second, on the liabilities side, increasingly intervened in market conditions on 
balance through the non-  standar d monetary 
policy measures it took as the financial and sov -
ereign debt crisis progressed.
Money and repo market 
 activity impaired
While the repo market was increasingly out of bounds for anything but high quality collateral, the Eurosystem significantly broadened the col -
lateral framework by lowering the general credit quality threshold for eligible collateral 
from A- to BBB-. The Eurosystem’s willingness 
to lend against riskier collateral tended to pri -
marily benefit banks which had taken on 
greater funding and credit risk than others and 
had therefore been hit harder by the general 
loss of confidence across the markets. Institu -
tions which in retrospect had managed risk less effectively than others ultimately stood to gain 
more from the Eurosystem’s operations and 
thus succeeded in evading some of the losses looming over their earnings. By contrast, banks 
which had funded their lending business in a 
stable manner with customer deposits and cap-
ital market instruments and chose not to use 
short-  t erm funding for long-  d ated securities 
(maturity transformation) as a means of gener -
ating interest income tended to reap fewer 
benefits from the non-  s tandard monetary pol -
icy measures.
The initially temporary narrowing of the inter -
est rate corridor on 9 October 2008 in a full 
allotment regime contributed to preventing 
short-  term money market r ates from falling too 
far below the main refinancing rate. However, 
full allotment and the narrower interest rate 
corridor meant that the highest interest margin 
which banks could generate with excess liquid -
ity in the one-  week maturity segment of the 
money market was limited to the spread be -
tween the main refinancing rate (at which 
banks requiring liquidity could procure Eurosys -
tem funding) and the deposit facility rate (at 
which banks with excess liquidity could safely 
invest current account holdings with the Euro-
system), that is to say, to half the width of the 
corridor of no more than 50 bp.17 Simply put, 
this means that whenever the appropriate 
credit risk premium for a money market trans-
action between banks was higher than this 
spread, it made no sense for banks with 
 liquidity surpluses to offer excess liquidity in the 
money market. This mechanism became more 
pertinent when the two reductions in key inter -
est rates in 2013 narrowed the interest rate 
corridor further still. This gave banks less of an incentive to balance their liquidity position hori -
zontally by participating in the interbank mar -
ket, while the Eurosystem’s current policy of 
conducting once-  weekly liquidity-  absorbing 
operations acted as a further substantial hin -
drance.Narrowing inter-

The manner in which excess liquidity contracts 
over time after the Eurosystem conducts at -
tractive refinancing operations is dictated to a 
large extent by the width of the interest rate 
corridor: a wide interest rate corridor usually 
encourages banks to reduce excess liquidity of 
their own accord by participating to a lesser 
 extent in shorter-  term r efinancing operations 
(which are normally offered as fixed-  r ate full al -
lotment operations) as soon as they can pro -
cure the funding less expensively in the money 
market. This diminishes banks’ aggregate cur -
rent account holdings, shortening the central 
bank’s balance sheet. On the other hand, if the 
spread between the main refinancing rate and 
the deposit facility rate is too narrow, this can 
slow the pace at which excess liquidity is 
 returned to the Eurosystem – a phenomenon 
which is observable at present.
Competition for funding: 
 deposits and bank debt
The fixed-  r ate full allotment of long-  term r efi-
nancing operations (particularly three 12-month 
tenders in 2009 and two three-  year tenders in 
late 2011/early 2012) facilitated large-  scale out -
flows of bank deposits and other funding re -
sources without forcing the banks in question 
to counter all these outflows by raising interest 
rates on deposits and/or procuring money and 
capital market funding. Thus, the Eurosystem’s 
additional liquidity-  p roviding operations fed 
through to influence competitive conditions between banks for customer deposits and 
other sources of funding. Over time, this in -
creasingly caused the long-  te rm central bank 
loans provided by the Eurosystem to have a 
funding effect. Each of the long-  term refinan -
cing operations constituted an intervention at a specific point of the yield curve (which normally 
steepens as maturities increase), enabling 
banks to engage in quasi - arbitrage transactions 
such as replacing their own money/capital mar -
ket funding with less expensive Eurosystem 
loans, or acquiring additional securities and using maturity-  matched Eur osystem funding to 
generate interest income (carry trades).18
A partial observation looking at each bank’s in -
dividual funding costs in the capital market can 
indicate the extent to which some of the coun -
terparties participating in monetary policy op -
erations inevitably receive preferential treat -
ment. Banks’ individual refinancing costs typic -
ally diverge strongly as maturities increase. 
While interest rates on overnight money mar -
ket transactions between banks domiciled in 
the euro area are usually only a few basis points 
apart, yield spreads on three-  year bank debt,  
say, can easily amount to 100 bp or even sig -
nificantly more, depending on the issuer’s creditworthiness. The longer the maturity of 
the funding instruments which banks use, the 
greater the divergence in their individual fund -
ing costs and, by the same token, the extent to 
which they are subsidised by long-  term Eur o-
system loans, which are offered at a uniform fixed interest rate. The subsidy element for a 
single major commercial bank which substan -
tially participated in the three-  year r efinancing 
operations could quite easily amount to more 
than €100 million over the entire term.
This is one of the main reasons why the meas-
ures which central banks use to implement 
monetary policy usually focus not on influen -
cing capital market rates for bank debt but on 
steering banks’ marginal liquidity and funding 
costs in the short-  term segment. Interventions 
in this segment barely alter market conditions, 
if at all, and the competitive conditions be -
tween banks for funding are hardly affected, provided the monetary policy operations are 
properly designed.Role played by

High level of excess  
liquidity and substantial 
 refinancing volume
The Eurosystem’s long-  term r efinancing oper -
ations met with a great deal of demand owing 
to the full allotment procedure and their very 
attractive maturities, interest rates and collat -
eral conditions. A number of other factors 
added to the attractiveness of the long-  term  
refinancing operations, including the zero weighting afforded to government bonds 
under the capital requirements (for which the 
Eurosystem is not responsible) and the option 
of using debt securities retained by issuers as collateral for Eurosystem credit which were marketable but not always liquid. A sudden 
spike in the volume of central bank refinancing 
in connection with the provision of additional 
Eurosystem liquidity operations confirms that from a participating bank’s perspective, the 
central bank’s operations are not only more fa -
vourable, systematically speaking, than market conditions at the given point in time (eg inter -
est rates for deposits or capital market instru -
ments) but also more attractive than other 
monetary policy operations.
The take-  up of these non-  standar d operations 
is indicative both of tension levels in the mar -
kets and the extent to which the operations 
alter competitive conditions. If the banking sys -
tem is experiencing a structural liquidity deficit and monetary policy refinancing operations are 
used to cover the deficit, the level of excess 
 liquidity is a yardstick for the extent to which 
banks – and, by extension, the assets they take 
onto their balance sheets – are supplied with additional liquidity or funded by the central bank. Interventions in competitive conditions 
through the channel of non-  standar d liquidity-  
providing monetary policy measures are justifi-
able provided they remain strictly within the boundaries of the Eurosystem’s mandate and 
they are maintained no longer than warranted by market conditions.How measures impact  
on  competition between 
 institutions
From the perspective of an entity providing 
 liquidity in the interbank money market, the 
overall impact of the measures reveals that the 
Eurosystem has deprived banks with excess 
 liquidity of a potential source of income on 
their liquidity inflows. Ultimately, many banks 
have attracted inflows of liquidity because in -
vestors and market participants have more 
confidence in them than in other credit institu-
tions. It is reasonable to assume that institu -
tions which saw strong liquidity inflows also tended to be the ones which had a superior 
capital base and a more robust funding struc -
ture, or which engaged in less risky business 
than other institutions.
As for institutions that haemorrhaged liquidity 
because they lost the confidence of investors and market participants, say, often combined 
with a rather imbalanced funding structure and 
a frail capital base, the fixed-  r ate full allotment 
of refinancing operations in an extended collat -
eral regime acted to curtail their interest costs. 
So in effect, these institutions were afforded 
preferential treatment by the Eurosystem.
Summary classification  
and assessment of measures
Any assessment of the first wave of non-  
standard monetary policy measures in the im -
mediate aftermath of the Lehman Brothers 
bankruptcy needs to weigh up two different 
aspects. First, the downside risks to price stabil-
ity which might have materialised had the 
 financial system got even more substantially 
out of kilter, potentially causing a broad-  based 
credit crunch. Second, stabilisation measures 
inevitably entail costs and risks. There is an in -
nate tension between the non-  standar d meas -
ures and the European Union’s market econ -
omy principles, although it is worth remember -

ridor to ± 50 bp was just a short-  lived measur e, 
lasting, as it did, only a little over three months. 
This significantly eased the temporary con -
straints which the Eurosystem’s measures im -
posed on market economy principles, particu -
larly between early October 2008 and the end 
of January 2009. Given the potential threat of 
a severe recession and the attendant downside risks to price stability, it can be concluded that 
the scale and duration of the measures adopted 
by the Eurosystem to stabilise the financial sys-tem were appropriate overall.
Yet from the perspective of market economy 
principles, it is problematic if some commercial banks become reliant on the Eurosystem for an extended period of time. This dependence can come about in two different ways. First, if the 
institutions are unable to obtain liquidity or 
funding from any other commercial bank – ei-
ther on an unsecured basis or against liquid collateral – no matter what interest rate they 
are prepared to pay (they are shut out of the 
money and capital market). Save for the non-  
standard liquidity-  pr oviding monetary policy 
measures, these institutions would face the 
acute risk of illiquidity. Second, a commercial 
bank can be dependent on central bank loans 
if its own funding costs in the market are so 
high that a stream of net interest losses would 
drive it into overindebtedness and ultimately in -
solvency. Banks that are persistently reliant on 
central bank loans should normally, by rights, 
exit the market because they have lost the con-
fidence of the markets, cannot safeguard their 
funding and have failed in their core duties of 
managing credit and liquidity risk.
By contrast, institutions may be described as 
using central bank loans opportunistically if 
they are theoretically able to tap the markets 
for funding but the conditions offered by the central bank are simply less expensive than market conditions. The opportunistic use of 
central bank loans –  first and foremost the 
long-  term r efinancing operations  – in the 
broader sense of the term is an equally undesir -
able state of affairs: in this case, monetary pol -icy enables banks –  and, by extension, their 
shareholders – to mine a potentially rich seam 
of earnings on a scale which is not available to entities that are shut out of the central bank’s 
refinancing operations, such as insurers and 
non- financial corpor ations. These potential 
earnings streams include the aforementioned carry trades – purchasing government bonds 
and using them as collateral in monetary policy 
refinancing operations – which do not require 
banks to comply with large exposure limits or 
necessarily hold capital against them. If the 
central bank offers long-  term r efinancing oper -
ations of this kind, commercial banks differ 
from non-  banks inasmuch as they can fund  
their business operations using central bank 
loans at the key interest rate for the sole reason that they hold eligible collateral as assets or can 
create it as part of their business operations 
and besides, only banks are authorised partici-
pants in the central bank’s liquidity operations.
In practice, there is no clear-  cut boundary div -
iding reliance on central bank loans and the 
merely opportunistic use of monetary policy 
operations against the backdrop of very favour -
able conditions, and it is often impossible to 
clearly assign banks to either of these distinct 
categories.
Starting points for steering

Banks individually

The introductory section of the Principles for 
Sound Liquidity Risk Management and Supervi -
sion which the Basel Committee on Banking 
Supervision (BCBS) published in September 
2008 unequivocally assigns primary responsibil -
ity for the sound management of liquidity risk 
to banks themselves. The explanatory notes on

in greater detail: they need to be able to ensure 
with a high degree of confidence that banks 
are in a position to both address their daily 
 liquidity obligations and withstand a period of 
liquidity stress affecting both secured and un -
secured funding, the source of which could be 
bank-  specific or market-  wide.19
The BCBS document not only provided an ob -
jective for banks’ liquidity risk management 
practices – one which was by no means con -
sistent with reality in the years immediately pre-
ceding the financial crisis, as it became increas-
ingly clear from August 2007 onwards, if not 
before. There were also clear signs that credit 
institutions’ failings in managing their liquidity 
(risk) were going to put the public sector – and 
central banks in particular – under ever greater 
pressure to take action. Given that a host of 
banks in the euro area remain as reliant as ever 
on central bank loans five and a half years on 
from the height of the financial crisis, the calls 
for banks themselves to ensure that they can 
always honour their payment obligations have acquired even greater urgency.
Reverting to a style of steering short-  term  
money market rates which is more in line with 
the market cannot come about if institutions 
do not take full responsibility once more for 
their inherent task of managing their own 
 liquidity, having not done so for years owing to 
the crisis-  induced hiatus. What this means  
practically for credit institutions is that they will 
need to prudently steer and address imbal -
ances in the asset/liability term profile (maturity transformation), even if that entails missing out 
on interest income. If the consequences of ex-
cessive maturity transformation had to be 
borne by the central bank – and thus, at the 
end of the day, by the general public – the level of liquidity risk taken on by the banks would be 
inefficiently high and any resulting profits 
would be privatised through payouts to share -
holders.Neutrality of monetary 
 operations for allocation  
of resources
Under normal circumstances, banks should 
not, then, continue to be able to obtain liquid -
ity and funding from the central bank at a 
lower rate than in the interbank money market. If central bank loans were much more attract -
ive for banks than individually negotiated mar -
ket terms, then using these facilities would 
mean intervening in the market price formation 
process, which might ultimately impair how 
 efficiently resources are allocated. In practice, 
therefore, banks need to be virtually indifferent to borrowing in the interbank money market or 
tapping the Eurosystem’s liquidity-  pr oviding 
operations. If the money market were steered 
in conformity with the market, this would also indirectly prevent debtors of securities or credit claims which are eligible collateral for Eurosys -
tem monetary policy operations from receiving preferential treatment.
Designing monetary policy 
 instruments from a market 
conformity perspective
The temporary full allotment of refinancing op -
erations can be largely in conformity with the 
market. A sufficiently wide interest rate corri -
dor between the main refinancing rate and the 
deposit facility rate in a high excess liquidity 
setting encourages banks to offer excess liquid-ity in the interbank money market at an interest 
rate that is lower than the main refinancing 
rate which institutions requiring liquidity need 
to pay to the central bank. This automatically 
drives down demand for the refinancing oper -
ations, diminishing the volume of excess liquid -
ity, and thus tends to allow the non-  standar d 
liquidity-  pr oviding monetary policy measures to 
be run off more quickly. The corridor between Banks that fail

the marginal lending facility and the deposit 
 facility rates needs to be sufficiently wide to 
 encourage money market activities and banks’ 
refinancing behaviour to continue to return to 
more normal levels.20
Conversely, a persistent high volume of excess 
liquidity coinciding with a structural liquidity 
deficit in the banking system can be interpreted 
as an indication that the interest rate corridor 
offers insufficient incentives for private money 
market activity. In this scenario, the risk premia 
for interbank loans to institutions which (need 
to) resort disproportionately to central bank 
loans would apparently be so high that central 
bank loans would be a less expensive source of 
funding for borrowers than the interbank 
money market. Added to this, the interest rate 
corridor needs to be wide enough to allow 
banks to generate sufficient interest income to 
cover credit risk as well as the cost of monitor -
ing potential counterparties in the interbank 
money market by the donor institution. If inad -
equate money market activity means that the 
highest possible interest margins, which are 
 effectively constrained by the interest rate cor -
ridor, are too low, it is no longer attractive for 
banks to monitor potential counterparties, 
prompting them to abandon money trading.21
Much like the temporary full allotment of short-  
term refinancing operations, a limited supply of 
longer-  term or even long-  term r efinancing op -
erations is not necessarily incompatible with 
the market conformity requirement for monet -
ary operations, provided that they are properly 
designed. LTROs can be largely in line with the 
market if they are limited in scope (ie kept in 
short supply) and they are allotted using com -
petitive variable-  r ate tender procedures. In this 
case, the central bank merely acts as the rate 
taker, rather like in the 3-month LTROs which 
the Eurosystem regularly offered prior to the 
 financial crisis. Allotment rates for these trans -
actions can then be expected to roughly match 
the interest rates for repo transactions with 
similar maturities and collateral quality, and 
they would neither send out an interest rate signal nor represent an intervention altering the term structure. Banks requiring a disproportion-
ately high volume of central bank funding be -
cause, say, they do not have robust access to 
the money and capital market through their 
own fault would then be exposed, at least par -
tially, to the disciplining effect of market forces.
So looking to the future, the markets will need 
to regain responsibility for setting interest rates 
for longer-  term bank funding. This would bol-
ster banks’ individual responsibility for man -
aging liquidity risk, and ultimately their credit 
risk as well, besides diminishing the extent to 
which the ongoing Eurosystem funding for 
some banks is still distorting competitive condi -
tions between banks.
Eligible collateral: credit quality 
standards and haircuts
Setting credit quality standards for collateral 
that is eligible for revolving central bank loans 
which are stricter than those in the repo mar -
ket reduces the risk of the central bank inter -
vening in the competition among banks for 
funding by providing refinancing against this 
collateral as part of its monetary policy oper -
ations, and thus unintentionally slipping into 
the role of lender of first resort. In the repo 
market, banks which take riskier assets onto 
their balance sheets and thereby expose them-
selves to funding risk (maturity transformation) 
would have to pay a market price for the mar -
ginal unit of current account holdings required 
for refinancing purposes, rather than a price 
which is more or less administered, depending 
on the bidding procedure, for participating in 
the central bank’s refinancing operations. The 
higher potential returns on riskier assets might Continued high

then be offset by higher funding costs, curbing 
the incentives for banks to purchase riskier se -
curities and grant riskier loans. For this reason, 
credit quality standards for eligible collateral 
and haircuts need to be brought more into line with market practice. The quality of eligible Eu -
rosystem collateral should normally at least 
match the collateral quality criteria in the repo market, and haircuts should be selected by the 
Eurosystem in such a way as to effectively hedge the Eurosystem against financial risk 
while not being lower than the haircuts in the 
repo market.
Profit-  oriented entities such as central counter -
parties have at times refused to accept certain 
low quality assets as general collateral or im -
posed prohibitively high haircuts, often on a 
discretionary basis. Central banks such as the 
Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve 
accept nothing but collateral of the highest 
quality in the monetary policy operations they 
use to steer the money market. Lower quality 
collateral is often only accepted in special facil-
ities designed to achieve financial stability goals 
where they have been, and still are, subject to 
higher interest rates22 and/or carry a stigma 
which is not normally desired by central banks 
but nonetheless exists to all extents and pur -
poses. The interest spreads and the stigma in -
volved usually mean that institutions either shun these facilities altogether or use them 
only to a minor degree and for a limited period 
of time. At the Bank of England, for instance, 
these operations are known as “liquidity insur -
ance” – so they are not, in the first instance, 
monetary policy operations but operations 
which are strongly geared to financial stability 
considerations and hence somewhat distinct 
from the instruments used to achieve monetary 
policy objectives. This also allows different prices to be set for predominantly monetary 
policy operations and those which mainly fol -
low financial stability goals without impairing 
the monetary policy signal sent out by the pol-icy rate.One key requirement of a Eurosystem collateral 
framework which is in conformity with the 
market is that, alongside credit claims of a suit -
able quality, the Eurosystem should only accept 
marketable collateral in the monetary policy operations it uses to steer the money market 
which is in fact liquid as well, that is to say ac -
cepted for use as collateral in secured money 
market transactions in the repo market. Other -
wise, there is a risk that certain securities cat -
egories are predominantly used as collateral for Eurosystem refinancing operations, which in it -
self would appear questionable from the per -
spective of market economy principles. A sim -
ple way of gauging whether this requirement 
has been breached either for a given security or an entire securities category would be to divide 
the volume submitted to the central bank by the total outstanding volume (placed in the 
market); if a persistent high proportion of se -
curities is used as Eurosystem collateral, this 
might suggest that eligibility criteria are some -
what too lax or – from a market conformity 
angle – that haircuts are insufficient. If a liquid -
ity crisis, say, causes the central bank to tem -
porarily abandon the principle of only providing 
funding against marketable collateral which is 
liquid – which may be a warranted course of action in times of crisis – it nonetheless runs 
the risk that its monetary operations briefly no 
longer satisfy the criterion of market conform -
ity in this respect. Market conformity tends to 
be more constrained, the less the cost of ob -
taining central bank funding distinguishes be -
tween different collateral quality levels and the 
lower the credit quality threshold for eligible 
collateral.
In all of these matters, the central bank must 
avoid being an ongoing source of central bank 
funding for institutions whose poor credit Should interest

22 As a case in point, the Bank of England sometimes 
offered funding against lower quality collateral at a tiered interest spread which successively increased as the quality of the collateral provided diminished. As part of its current 
Indexed Long-  T erm Repo operations, the Bank of England 
requires minimum interest spreads of as much as 15 bp at 
present for borrowing against different collateral sets in

Using asset-backed securities as eligible collateral and 
for obtaining Eurosystem refi  nancing on favourable terms
Up to now, the Eurosystem has not made a 
distinction between collateral of differing 
quality when setting interest rates for mon-
etary policy refi  nancing operations. More-
over, the rate on refi  nancing operations does not depend on the maturity of the 
 refi  nancing operations. For various kinds of collateral, the Eurosystem refi  nancing oper-
ations conducted as full- allotment tenders in the context of an expanded collateral framework have become an attractive 
source of fi  nancing, which has been used in 
an opportunistic manner and on a large 
scale by numerous banks.
Amongst other things, this has led to more 
and more asset- backed securities (ABS) 
being pledged directly to the Eurosystem – 
ABS which issuers have found all but impos-
sible to place on the primary market since 
the onset of the fi  nancial crisis. For banks, 
ABS have the advantage that they allow them to bundle loans that are otherwise 
 virtually impossible to sell or refi  nance. ABS 
are now often used by banks solely to 
 ensure fi  nancing from the Eurosystem. This is evident, for example, in the clear increase 
in the size of transactions and very low  coupons  – a sign of the collateral value 
being optimised. There is often no “market 
test” to determine whether private invest-
ors are at all willing to pay a price for these 
securities. From an investor’s perspective, 
however, risk factors are now less of a con-
sideration. Instead, banks point out that 
they refrain from acquiring ABS on account 
of the increased regulatory requirements, 
since the returns to be achieved with them are unattractive when measured against the capital requirements imposed by regulators. 
The reduced market activity means that 
there is a shortage of market price informa-
tion that the Eurosystem could use as a 
basis for determining the value of the col-
lateral. The Eurosystem substitutes model- based “theoretical prices” for the missing market prices, with the theoretical prices now being more predominant than market 
prices for the ABS pledged to the Eurosys-
tem.
A concentration of essentially marketable 
assets, which, however, can rarely be placed 
on the market at present, might be an  indication that the Eurosystem has sub-
verted market conditions since the onset of 
the  fi  nancial crisis and, in doing so, inter-fered in competition between institutions. 
However, regulatory aspects could also be 
playing a part in banks’ increased use of ABS as collateral for Eurosystem refi  nan-
cing. With regard to the level of regulatory 
requirements for European ABS, which is the target of complaints from various 
sources, it is important to note that, on the 
one hand, credit risk trading is fundamen-
tally a useful market from an economic per-spective.
On the other hand, the stricter regulation of 
ABS since the onset of the fi  nancial crisis 
should prompt fi  nancial market players to 
take due account of risks so that, at the end 
of the day, the taxpayer is not left bearing 
responsibility for the risks which banks have 
taken with the intention of making a pri-vate profi  t. In any event, the combination 
of stricter regulation and attractive Eurosys-
tem refi  nancing operations with full allot-ment of tenders has led to a widespread 
collapse in the market for certain ABS, leav-
ing the Eurosystem to fi  nance a consider-
able part of the ABS senior tranches. Thus, 
the key question with regard to market orientation – a question which remains to 
be answered – is whether regulation is leav-ing enough room for market participants to 
carry out appropriate transactions in the 
market on their own responsibility. Indeed, 
the Eurosystem should organise its monet-
ary policy refi  nancing operations, including 
the current collateral framework, in such a 
way that it does not become the primary 
source of funding for certain asset classes.Deutsche Bundesbank

standing means that they can no longer obtain 
liquidity and funding from other market players 
in the money and capital market. The transition 
to this kind of post-  crisis r egime can be sup -
ported by the assessment of banks’ balance 
sheets, which is currently being carried out be -
fore the ECB assumes responsibility for the Sin -
gle Supervisory Mechanism. This review seeks to shed light on weaknesses in the balance 
sheets of the institutions being examined, iden -
tify the need for action and prepare the ground for decisions regarding necessary capital meas -
ures or, if need be, the resolution of institu -
tions. This would also support the process by 
which banks’ refinancing behaviour returns to 
more normal levels and bolster the growth in 
confidence in the money and financial markets.
Conclusion
Time and again, the deployment of non-  
standard liquidity-  pr oviding monetary policy 
measures to steer the money market has kept 
the financial system functioning through the 
crisis in recent years. Considering the severity 
of the tension observed during the crisis, the 
measures taken were certainly warranted on 
the whole. Yet it must not be forgotten that 
these measures also set substantial adverse in -
centives, the effects of which become more pertinent the longer the measures remain in 
place.
The combination of full allotment, long-  term  
monetary policy refinancing operations, a 
broad range of counterparties and an extended collateral framework in recent years is likely to 
have contributed to the outcome that hardly any credit institutions were forced out of the 
market, almost regardless of how much risk 
they had taken on and how far the credit risk, 
not to mention the liquidity and funding risk they had taken on with a view to reaping 
higher potential profits, actually materialised.
While it is true that discontinuing the non-  
standard policy measures introduced in re-
sponse to the crisis is not yet on the agenda at 
the current juncture, the Eurosystem needs to 
ask itself the question, after years in crisis re -
sponse mode, what role a central bank operat -
ing an independent monetary policy can play in 
the future. This particularly includes intensely 
debating whether and to what extent the Euro -
system does not merely cover the banking sys -
tem’s aggregate liquidity deficit but is also 
allowed to fund banks and thereby intervene in 
competitive conditions between institutions.
As a general principle, the market mechanism, 
augmented by an appropriate regulatory 
framework, can make important contributions 
towards curbing the risk taken on by banks, 
unless rescuing banks to safeguard short-  term  
financial stability becomes the norm, rather 
than the exception. The Eurosystem therefore 
needs to strengthen the disciplining effect of 
money and capital market forces and make 
banks responsible for the consequences of 
their actions. More than five years on from the 
height of the financial crisis, it is becoming ever 
more important to help the money market to 
return to more normal conditions, not least as a means of letting the healing effect of compe-
tition reduce the existing inefficiencies in the 
banking and financial system and enhancing 
growth prospects in the euro area.Only financially

Some approaches to explaining the 
behaviour of inflation since the last financial 
and economic crisis
Following the sharp downturn in 2008-09, the real economy recovered only gradually in most 
industrial countries and unemployment remained high. By contrast, inflation rates were relatively 
stable. The widely feared deflation did not materialise, even if concerns in this regard have been expressed more loudly again in the public debate recently. The following article discusses a num-ber of factors which have made a significant contribution to this inflation picture. First, the links between capacity utilisation of the domestic economy and domestic inflation appear less signifi -
cant than previously. Another consideration is that the measurement of an economy’s capacity 
utilisation is surrounded by considerable uncertainty, especially at the current end. Furthermore, global factors have obviously gained significance. On the other hand, inflation expectations have reacted little to prevailing events. This indicates that central banks have succeeded in anchoring 
expectations solidly and close to their target figures and thus preventing a self-  r einforcing spiral 
of actual and expected price changes. Looking ahead, it is important to sustain this confidence. To this end, it is not only crucial to keep monetary policy transparent and to continue with a pol -
icy of stability. Fiscal policymakers also need to reduce deficits again, so that no lasting conflicts with monetary policy arise in this respect.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
The current economic outlook for the euro 
area leads us to expect that a gradual recovery 
from the severe crisis is setting in, with growth even in those countries most severely hit by the 
economic downturn picking up again. None -
theless, inflation has fallen in past months (see chart on page 63). At 0.5% currently, it is below 
the Eurosystem’s target, which aims for an average inflation rate below but close to 2% 
over the medium term.
Inflation has also declined in most of the other 
industrialised economies in the recent past. At 
1.5%, it is currently below the average of the 
last ten years in the United States, which has 
recently seen a significant revival in growth. 
Japan is a special case, to an extent, with prices 
currently pointing upwards again after many 
years with negative inflation rates.
This picture has led to fears of deflationary risks 
and their negative consequences of late. There 
are several reasons why it is deemed important 
to avoid continually falling prices. For one, the 
debts of private and public sector agents rise in 
real terms and this would lead to negative con -
sequences for their behaviour and the econ -
omy overall. Furthermore, there would be rea-
son to fear that such a development would 
impact the stability of the financial system, be-
cause more debtors would be seen to be at risk. There are also concerns that consumers 
would limit their spending in anticipation of a 
further reduction in prices, which might lead to 
a self-  r einforcing downward price spiral. Finally, 
this picture is compounded by the fact that in a deflationary climate monetary policy might find itself in a situation where it can no longer exert 
the usual stabilising effect, because nominal interest rates cannot fall substantially below 
zero.
However, immediately following the sharp 
downturn in economic activity in 2008-09, the 
debate centred on the fact that inflation rates 
overall quickly rose again to a level roughly equivalent to that before the crisis, although 
the real indicators suggested a serious under -
utilisation of capacity in some instances. Specu-lation therefore arose about the reasons for the 
surprising resilience of inflation rates and con -
cern was expressed about expansionary eco -
nomic policy possibly paving the way for a fu-ture acceleration of inflation.
An assessment of prospects for future price 
trends has been made more difficult in recent 
years by the fact that the economic situation is 
characterised by a series of special factors, ran -
ging from structural distortions and the crisis in 
the financial sector, to the unusually severe and 
worldwide downturn in growth in 2008-09, 
and the extraordinary monetary and fiscal pol -
icy countermeasures. These include central 
bank rates at, or close to, zero and unconven-
tional monetary policy measures, whereby the 
central banks purchased securities, on a large 
scale in some cases, as well as expansionary fis -
cal policies with a sharp increase in govern -
ment deficits.
The following first briefly examines how infla -
tion has behaved since the onset of the crisis. A 
common instrument of analysis, the New 
Keynesian Phillips curve, is then used as a 
framework for explaining the determinants of 
price behaviour. It seems that the relationship 
between prices and real movements in the 
economy has become somewhat weaker, while 
international influences have become more im -
portant. However, inflation expectations in par -
ticular appear significant for the actual behav -
iour of prices.1 They are also therefore very 
relevant for the central banks, which is why we shall subsequently examine how these inflation expectations can be measured. Finally, we shall 
put forward some considerations deserving at -
tention if inflation expectations are to be an -
chored close to their target in the future.Low inflation

Prices since the start  
of the crisis
Inflation in the euro area showed a favourable 
pattern before the crisis and fluctuated only 
slightly around the target of just under 2% set 
by the Eurosystem as part of its mandate. There 
was a similar pattern in the United States, al -
beit with somewhat higher inflation. The infla -
tion rate for the overall index of consumer 
prices and a measure of core inflation (exclud -
ing the typically very volatile components en -
ergy and unprocessed food) showed a similar 
dynamic. However, headline inflation began to rise significantly in 2007, reaching a peak in July 
2008. This was due amongst other things to developments in the energy markets, where 
the oil price reached a new all-  time high.
The international financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 led to an abrupt reversal in increasing 
price levels and total inflation even declined to 
below zero briefly. Core inflation remained positive but fell below 1%. Inflation then ini -
tially rose to its pre-  crisis level for a short time. 
It has subsequently declined again and is cur -
rently 0.5% in the euro area.
This movement in prices might suggest that 
following a considerable but short-  lived decline 
in output there was a fairly rapid recovery in 
the course of 2010. However, the recovery re-mained incomplete in many countries, as dem-
onstrated especially by unemployment num -
bers.
In the euro area, although the unemployment 
rate rose sharply in 2009, mirroring the decline 
in inflation, it did not return to its pre-  crisis  
level. Instead, the unemployment rate con -
tinued to rise, after declining briefly at the be -
ginning of 2011, and is now 12%.
The high unemployment rate, in other words 
an underutilisation of labour, is the reflection of 
an output gap, which is defined as the differ -
ence between actual output and estimated po -
tential output. A gap implies that the actual output is below the level to be expected under 
normal circumstances. A series of output gap estimates have shown a very high level of 
underutilisation of capacity in recent years.
However, estimates of an economy’s capacity 
utilisation are surrounded by considerable un-
certainty, particularly at the current end. There -
fore in the past significant revisions often be -
came necessary, which might be equivalent to 
the size of the gap itself. Estimates by inter -
national organisations are no exception, as shown by an analysis in this Monthly Report 
(see On the reliability of international organisa-
tions’ estimates of the output gap, pages 13 
to 35). The special circumstances surrounding 
the  sever e financial and economic crisis have 
recently exacerbated this uncertainty further. It 
is therefore possible that the output gap was 
smaller than assumed with the usual measures.

output gap following the crisis, then an explan -
ation is needed, in particular, as to why, in spite 
of rising unemployment and output gaps in 
general following the crisis, inflation has not been at a much lower level for much longer 
than actually observed.2 One important reason 
was probably the administrative and tax meas -
ures which many countries felt forced to adopt 
due to their fiscal difficulties. The following 
 section examines in more detail other factors 
responsible for the behaviour of inflation ob -
served since the beginning of the crisis. Particu-
lar attention will be paid to inflation expect -
ations and, for the pre-  crisis period, global fac -
tors as determinants of inflation  – consider -
ations which might also play a part in estimating future price trends.
Factors determining price 
 development
As an analytical framework, the following dis -
cussion is based on the New Keynesian Phillips curve, which is often used to examine the fac-
tors determining inflation. As with the trad -
itional Phillips curve, this curve, too, captures an interdependency between inflation on the 
one hand and the change in the output gap 
and other indirect or direct cost factors on the 
other. However, the defining feature of this 
new form of the Phillips curve is its microeco -
nomic basis. This better reflects the link be -
tween changes in inflation and the underlying 
determinants of an enterprise’s price-  setting  
behaviour, for example its costs or competitive 
situation. In addition, this framework attaches 
great importance to forward-  looking expect -
ations. By contrast, the traditional Phillips curve 
took into account past inflation as an explana -
tory factor, which could imply that only past 
experience determines future expectations.
The New Keynesian Phillips curve is based on 
the notion that enterprises – under the given 
restrictions – set their prices in such a way as to 
maximise profits. For enterprises in the process 
of resetting their prices, both the prevailing costs and the size of the potential profit margin 
are the key determinants in price selection. The 
profit margin which an enterprise can achieve 
according to the model of monopolistic com -
petition is determined by its competitive situ -
ation. It is all the more favourable for the enter -
prise the less elastic the reaction shown by de -
mand to its price changes.
When deriving the Phillips curve, it is also as -
sumed that not all firms are in a position to change their prices at all times. Firms must 
therefore take into account both inflation and 
costs expected in the future when setting 
prices that cannot be changed for some time.
The equilibrium result of enterprises’ decision-  
making can be explained on the basis of an overall relationship between current and ex -
pected inflation and average real marginal 
costs. In a closed economy, the marginal costs 
would be dependent mainly on unit labour 
costs, which are defined as wages divided by 
productivity per employee. In an open econ -
omy, in which enterprises also purchase inter -
mediate goods from abroad, account must be 
taken, too, of international interlinkages be-
tween the economies, using exchange rates 
and import prices as further determinants.
Empirical studies on the Phillips curve use vari-
ous measures to try to record influences on in -
flation from marginal costs. These measures are 
intended to reflect the capacity utilisation of 
the economy. It is assumed, for instance, that 
high wage demands will lead to high cost in -
creases if unemployment is low. This would 
suggest a connection between the labour mar -
ket situation and inflation. Another commonly 
used measure is the output gap, where the ac -
tual output is compared with potential output.
Significant uncertainty prevails in both cases. In

variables, current unemployment must be com -
pared with the unemployment rate for which 
the influence on inflation is neutral. Similarly, 
for the output gap a suitable measure must be found for potential output.
The well-  known difficulties in measuring these 
variables were further intensified by the crisis. 
The question arose, for example, to what ex -
tent unemployed persons previously employed 
in sectors such as construction, which had 
been booming in some countries, but with little 
prospect of being rehired there in the foresee -
able future following the end of the boom, 
could be assigned to the potential labour force. 
A similar problem arises when attempting to 
estimate the capital stock available to the econ -
omy, in view of severe structural changes, 
which are likely to mean there is no longer any demand for certain capital goods.
Apart from the problem of capturing the cap -
acity utilisation of economies correctly, there is 
also the question of to what extent it affects 
inflation and whether its influence has changed latterly. Various recent studies in fact show that 
the significance of the domestic output gap for 
changes in inflation in the past two decades 
has been relatively low (see the box on 
pages 21 to 24).3
Such empirical findings are consistent with the 
observation that in 2010 and 2011, when cap-
acity utilisation appeared very low, the inflation 
rates tended to be high, whilst inflation decel -
erated again recently, although the economies 
are on the road to recovery, albeit to varying degrees. A series of possible arguments can 
help to explain this observation. They are not 
necessarily mutually exclusive.
Several studies focus on wage rigidity to ex -
plain why the respective output gap has less of 
an impact on wages and prices. Wage rigidity 
can be influenced by institutional factors, such as the way in which negotiated wages are set 
or wage indexation. Furthermore, in the past this rigidity has been more pronounced in re -cessions in particular, when actually wage de -
creases and not just weaker wage increases 
were to be expected. Whether these observa -
tions have continued to apply during the crisis remains an open question at the current time, however.
4
Other studies focus on arguments which relate more to problems in the financial sector as an 
important aspect of the recent crisis. Banks 
have taken a more cautious approach towards 
lending in such an environment and accord -
ingly it has been more difficult for underfunded 
enterprises in particular to finance themselves 
from external sources. In line with these con -
siderations, it has been observed that in spite 
of a decline in demand such firms have not re -
duced prices or have even increased prices.5 
Overall, such behaviour also causes the estab -
lished relationships between aggregate cap -
acity utilisation and price changes to become less clear, at least for a time, and the Phillips 
curve to become flatter during this period.
In the debate about inflation determinants, the 
consequences of closer international integra -
tion of product markets, as well as labour and 
financial markets, have been a focal point for 
some time now. There is much to suggest in 
general that in view of increasing globalisation 
national determinants have lost some influ -
ence. One simple way of checking this is to in-
clude import prices as an additional determin -
ant in the Phillips curve. Such empirical ap -
proaches often show that – measured by the 
corresponding coefficient – since the beginning 
of the past decade import prices have had a 
more pronounced influence on domestic prices 
in the industrialised countries.6 However, im -
port prices cannot automatically be regarded 
as pre-  determined. First, for eign suppliers may Reduction in

adapt to domestic price conditions and, 
second, the price-  se tting behaviour of foreign 
suppliers is influenced by conditions in their 
own countries, which in turn are dependent on 
other countries. In addition, the rest of the 
world may influence the domestic situation via 
other channels, such as immigration and emi -
gration, and thus affect domestic inflation. 
Therefore, rather than merely focusing on im -
port prices, a more compelling approach would 
be to attempt to identify the various global 
 determinants and to ascertain their signifi -
cance for domestic prices. The box on pages 67 
and  68 describes this approach. The corres -
ponding findings (for the pre-  crisis period) indi -
cate that the influence of domestic output 
gaps on  domestic inflation r ates has indeed 
weakened over time. Furthermore, it is evident 
that  domestic rates of price change have been 
very dependent on global factors in the past 
three decades. It seems that, in particular, com -
mon trends on labour markets and in product -
ivity, import price inflation, international com -
petition and global interest rate developments 
have played a major role. This has also led not 
least to a marked synchronisation of inflation 
rates across the world.
The role of inflation 
 expectations and how they 
are measured
As mentioned above, one distinctive feature of 
the New Keynesian Phillips curve is the way 
that it emphasises the importance of forward-  
looking inflation expectations for current prices. 
Enterprises which are anticipating largely stable 
prices in future do not have any need at present 
to change their prices. Expectations of future 
price changes, on the other hand, prompt en -
terprises which are only able to make price ad -
justments at certain intervals to take appropri-ate action right away.
It is therefore essential for monetary policymak -
ers to influence future inflation expectations in 
the desired manner to the best of their ability and to adequately respond to changes in infla -
tion expectations. The measuring of inflation 
expectations presents a particular challenge, 
however.
There are a number of methods that can be 
applied to try to measure expected future infla -
tion rates. One approach is to analyse relevant surveys, another is to derive the expected infla-
tion rates from financial market prices. Surveys 
can be used to ask respondents directly about 
expected inflation rates. Inflation expectations 
are derived from financial market prices by 
using calculations that are based on certain as -
sumptions that do not have to be made in the 
case of surveys. On the other hand, it can be 
assumed when analysing financial market 
prices that the market participants attempt, out 
of self-  inter est, to make the best possible fore -
cast of future inflation, whereas this cannot 
 necessarily be assumed in the case of survey 
participants. Furthermore, financial market 
prices are much more frequently available than 
survey results, which means that they can pro -
vide more up-  to-  date and detailed information.
Many industrial countries carry out surveys of 
future inflation expectations using a range of 
different variants. These surveys may, for ex -
ample, focus on different price indices, they 
can also target different groups of individuals 
or they can take account of various forecast 
horizons. Indicators in widespread use for the 
United States include the Blue Chip Survey and the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF). For 
the euro area, too, there are a number of sur -
veys which focus on expected rates of inflation; 
these include, for instance, the Consumer Sur -
vey of the European Commission and the ex -
pert survey conducted by Consensus Econom -
ics. The SPF plays a special role in this respect, 
which involves the ECB questioning various fi -
nancial and other institutions about their infla -
tion expectations.7Inflation expect -

On the global dimension of infl  ation
A recent Bundesbank study1 looks at the 
degree of co- movement in the infl  ation 
rates of 24 OECD countries and the most important global (and country- specifi  c) 
 determinants between the third quarter of 
1980 and the fi  rst quarter of 2007. The an-
alysis is based on a dynamic multi- country 
model of the Phillips curve in a reduced 
form. The most important determinants of 
domestic infl  ation in the baseline model are the output gap and unit labour costs. These 
variables are decomposed into common 
components (ie those parts of the variables that would be driven by global or country- 
specifi  c factors, whose movements are transmitted to other countries within a quarter) and country- specifi  c factors (ie changes that are not transmitted to other countries within a quarter). The compon-ents are incorporated into the model as separate regressors. This approach thus allows domestic infl  ation to be infl  uenced by global factors through their impact on 
domestic demand and supply conditions. In 
addition, import price infl  ation and past 
 infl  ation are used as regressors in the base-
line model. As a result, the baseline model 
has the following form
where ∆pit is the (quarter- on- quarter) dif-
ference in the log consumer price index 
(CPI) of country i. Furthermore, index i de-
notes the country- specifi  c (or idiosyncratic) 
components, whereas index c  denotes the 
common components. Infl  ation is regressed 
on past infl  ation, import price infl  ation of commodities (∆ imc
it), infl  ation of other  import prices (∆ imncit), country- specifi  c 
and common components of the output gap – as a trend deviation from real GDP determined using the Hodrick- Prescott fi  l-ter  – (y
 ic
it and y cc
it ) and the corresponding 
components of log differences in unit 
 labour costs (∆ulc ic
it and ∆ulc cc
it ). The com-
mon and idiosyncratic components of the output gap and of unit labour costs are  estimated with the aid of a factor model with two factors. The model is estimated as  a system using a seemingly unrelated 
 regressions (SUR) estimator.2 Possible correl-
ations between residuals are taken into  account. However, at the same time, the 
coeffi   cients may vary across countries.
To assess how robust the results of the 
baseline model are and to establish whether, 
besides import prices and the common 
components of output gaps and unit labour 
costs, there are any additional global fac-tors which have an impact on domestic  infl  ation, the baseline model is then ex-
panded to include other (observable) global 
factors. Finally, it is to be noted that the  results of the (backward- looking) baseline 
model remain virtually unchanged if meas-
ures of infl  ation expectations (survey- based 
or based on own infl  ation forecasts) are 
used as additional regressors.
The a nalysis (baseline model and extended 
model versions) reveals three important 
fi  ndings. First, there is a strong co- movement 
1 See S Eickmeier and K Pijnenburg (2013), The Global 
Dimension of Infl  ation – Evidence from Factor- 
Augmented Phillips Curves, Oxford Bulletin of Econom-
ics and Statistics, 75(1), pp 103-122.2 See A Zellner (1962), An Effi   cient Method of Estimat-

of international infl  ation rates.3 The fi  rst 
and the second global factor explain 59% 
and 11%, respectively, of the average vari-
ation in overall infl  ation rates across all 
countries. Other factors play only a subor-
dinate role.
Second, the common component of unit 
 labour costs clearly impacts on domestic  infl  ation, which could be attributable to 
globalisation- related developments, such as 
migration fl  ows, production facilities being 
shifted abroad, structural change away from the more unionised manufacturing 
sector towards services, institutional change 
in the labour markets (eg lower wage in-dexation) and general technological ad-
vances.4
Third, domestic infl  ation is also infl  uenced by import price infl  ation (excluding supply 
shocks on the global crude oil market), ex-
ternal competition and global interest rate 
developments. Other global variables, such as worldwide demand conditions, oil supply 
developments and exchange rates are  either not signifi  cant or their impact on 
 infl  ation is not stable.
Political decision- makers looking to assess infl  ation developments therefore need to 
closely track global labour market and prod-
uctivity developments, import prices and 
international interest rate developments.
In addition, the model was estimated on the basis of rolling windows as well. The 
 relationship between domestic infl  ation and 
(both country- specifi  c and global compon-
ents of) the output gap appears to have weakened on the whole over time, al-though the results are dependent on the 
size of the window to a certain extent.
It is important to note that the analysis was 
carried out on the basis of a traditional  rather than a micro- founded New Keynes-
ian Phillips curve. Whereas the data are 
often better captured in a traditional New 
Keynesian Phillips curve, the structural inter-pretation of the results is easier on a micro- founded basis. Moreover, the study’s obser-vation period ends before the onset of the global fi  nancial crisis. It is possible that rela-tionships have changed and that additional 
factors (eg fi  nancial factors) have gained importance in recent years (as outlined in 
the main text of this article).

Unlike many other surveys, this survey does not 
just enquire about point forecasts. Participants are also asked to give their opinion on the like -
lihood of various inflation developments occur -
ring. To this end, participants are presented 
with a series of intervals, which have a width of 
½ percentage point and cover a range of be -
tween -1% and 4%. For each of these intervals, the participants are asked to give their opinion 
on the probability of the future inflation rate falling within the respective interval.
8 This 
allows important information to be garnered 
about the uncertainty of expected future infla -
tion rates. Furthermore, the probability data 
can be used to calculate the expected inflation 
rate for each individual participant.9 This can 
differ from the point forecast for a number of 
different reasons. The differences generally tend to be minimal, however. Both the ex -
pected inflation rates as well as the corres -
ponding uncertainty can be important if one 
wishes to form a judgement as to how firmly 
anchored inflation expectations are.
If the probabilities for each interval are aver -
aged across all participants, this allows the ag -
gregate probability distribution to be obtained 
for the future rate of inflation. The expected 
rate of inflation, which is derived from the ag -
gregate probability distribution, corresponds to 
the average across all the individual inflation 
expectations. The uncertainty of the aggregate 
probability distribution corresponds to the sum 
of the variance of the individual expected infla-
tion rates (as a measure as to what extent the 
opinion of the respondents differs) and the 
average individual uncertainty of the partici -
pants (as a measure of how uncertain each in -
dividual respondent is).10 The variance also 
serves as a measure of uncertainty in this con -
text. A low level of uncertainty suggests a 
firmer anchoring of the inflation expectations.
The ECB’s SPF is carried out on a quarterly 
basis. The participants are asked about their in -
flation expectations for various forecast hori -
zons. The longest forecast horizon is four to five years and therefore contains information about long-  t erm inflation rates, ie about the 
annual rates of change in the Harmonised 
Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) in four to five years. The aggregate probability distribution for 
the long-  term inflation expectations in the sur -
vey from the first quarter of 2014 shows only a 
slight shift towards lower inflation rates com -
pared with the survey carried out in the fourth 
quarter of 2009 prior to the escalation of the 
sovereign debt crisis (see chart above). Realisa -
tions in the range of between 0.5% and 1.5% are now seen as being slightly more probable, whereas the probabilities in the range of 1.5% 
to 2.5% have fallen accordingly. The expected 
inflation rate has therefore declined only mar -
ginally. The degree of uncertainty has increased slightly, however.
As can be seen in the chart on page 70, the momentum and also the level of the various 
measures for the long-  t erm inflation expect -
ations extracted from the SPF for the euro area 
do not show any major differences over time. … showed a

8 Participants are also asked about the likelihood of infla -

probability is distributed within an interval. It is assumed below that the overall probability is concentrated in the centre of the interval. Alternative assumptions generally 
produce only slightly different results.

With a few exceptions, the average point fore-
cast and the average expected value fall within 
a range which is in line with the Eurosystem’s 
definition of price stability, ie just under 2%. Al -
though the long-  term inflation expectations fel l 
slightly in the last two quarters, they still held 
up at around 1.9%.
With regard to the uncertainty of long-  term in -
flation developments, the change in which 
over time is shown in the chart above, it can be seen that the inflation expectations exhibit only 
a very small standard deviation. This means 
that not only does the average expected value 
usually lie at just under 2%, but the individual 
expected values are also very frequently found close to this level. The uncertainty of the aggre-gate probability distribution therefore primarily feeds on the individual uncertainties of the sur -
vey participants. Although the survey partici -
pants generally assign the highest probability 
to a long-  term inflation rate of just under 2%, 
they consider values which are a relatively long way above or below this level to be quite prob -
able, too.
The individual uncertainty recorded quite a 
sharp rise in the period from the third quarter 
of 2009 to the second quarter of 2010, when 
there was an escalation of the sovereign debt 
crisis. Since then, the individual uncertainty has 
remained at roughly the same level as back 
then. This development is reflected in the un -
certainty which applies in the aggregate prob -
ability distribution.
Expectations about future inflation rates can also be derived from the prices of financial 
market instruments. Inflation-  indexed bonds  
and inflation swaps, for example, are designed 
in such a way that they compensate investors 
ex post  for the inflation rates that are realised 
during their term. This is why market partici -
pants have to form a judgement about the ex -
pected future inflation rate when concluding the contract as this ultimately determines the payment stream and thus the price of the in -
strument. When deriving inflation expectations, additional premiums have to be taken into con-
sideration to account for the counterparty de -
fault risk or the varying liquidity of the traded 
products. In the case of an inflation swap, the 
counterparties agree to swap pre-  dete rmined 
fixed payments in exchange for variable pay -
ments. The variable payment is directly linked 
to the rate of inflation during the term of the 
instrument. By contrast, inflation expectations 
are derived from bonds by taking the differ -
ence in yields on bonds with the same maturity 
with and without compensation for inflation. 
The derived values are known as break-  even in -
flation rates (BEIR) as this is the point where the 
real yield plus the expected inflation rates and 
any possible premiums correspond exactly to 
the nominal yield. In the following, the expect -
ations in five years’ time will be considered, 
which relate to developments in the following five years. This is also referred to as the implied 
five- year forwar d inflation expectation five 
years ahead (forward BEIR). Economists use this 
variable as it is less susceptible to short-  term  Measuring

shocks. Over the course of the past three years, 
the forward BEIR extracted from inflation swaps 
exchanged in interbank trading hovered at around 2.2% per year, whereas the forward BEIR with the same maturity calculated from 
high-  quality government bond yields fluctuated 
more in the course of the crisis and currently stands at just under 2.0%, as can be seen in 
the adjacent chart.11
One other way of deriving inflation expect -
ations is through inflation options. These can 
be used to estimate probability distributions 
and thus also to determine the variance or the 
skewness, in addition to the expected value. 
An inflation option gives the bearer the right to 
a compensation payment in the event that the realised rate of inflation is above (cap) or below 
(floor) an inflation rate threshold agreed upon 
conclusion of the contract. It is standard mar -
ket practice to fix the threshold values for the 
inflation rate in increments of 50 basis points. 
A risk-  neutr al probability distribution for the ex -
pected rate of inflation can then be derived from several inflation options with different 
threshold values. This is because, assuming that 
investors are risk-  neutr al, the value of an op -
tion is precisely equal to the present value 
– discounted at the risk-  fr ee interest rate – of 
the expected future-  inflation-  linked outpay -
ment to the bearer of the option. The adjacent 
chart shows the distribution of the individual 
probabilities of occurrence at two points in 
time.12 When the inflation option data became 
available in the autumn of 2009, the majority 
of market participants were still anticipating in -
flation rates of between 1% and 2% for the 
next five years. By way of comparison, the Inflation expectations based on financial

11 In times of crisis, there is always an increase in demand 
for nominal bonds with the highest credit rating, especially 
Bunds, as these are seen as secure and liquid assets. This 
has an impact on their yield and thus on the derived BEIR. 
By contrast, inflation-  indexed German government bonds  
are less liquid owing to the smaller number outstanding 
and the lower number of issues and, compared with nom -
inal bonds, there is no increase in demand during times of 
severe crisis.12 A detailed description of the probability distribution for

probability of the occurrence of inflation rates 
of between 1% and 2% declined in April 2014. 
According to this method, a larger number of 
market participants are now expecting inflation 
rates of between 0% and 1% for the next five 
years. As already seen in the SPF, the distribu -
tion has, on the whole, shifted to the left. Fur -
thermore, market participants now consider the risk of deflation to be somewhat more 
likely. Nevertheless, the assumption of risk neu-
trality overestimates the likelihood of tail risks, 
with the result that the actually expected prob-
ability of a deflationary scenario occurring is likely to be much lower.
13 The more stable 
probability distribution of expected inflation rates over a longer time horizon of ten years 
also suggests that lower inflation rates are pri -
marily expected for the next five-  year period.14
On the whole it can be stated that long-  term  
inflation expectations, in particular, have re -
mained very stable throughout the crisis, right 
up to the current end. This is probably also one 
of the main reasons why the actual rates of 
price change in the euro area have not altered 
as much on the whole as could have been ex -
pected based on the trends in output gaps and 
unemployment rates.
The observed anchoring of the inflation expect -
ations in the face of considerable challenges is 
often connected to a clear, price stability-  
oriented monetary policy mandate, the greater 
independence of the central banks and their 
clear and transparent monetary policy strat -
egies. The transparency of the strategy helps 
market participants to assess the determinants 
and the consequences of monetary policy ac -
tion. On the other hand, the transparency has 
the effect of strengthening the commitment of 
central banks to achieving their own targets: any attempt to deviate from their announced 
targets would, under these circumstances, pro-voke counterreactions from the market partici -
pants and thus call into question the success of the respective attempts from the outset.
15The severe and persistent economic crisis, 
which has been ongoing since 2008, has, how -
ever, led economic policy  makers to implement 
a number of extraordinary measures. The long-  
term consequences of these measures are diffi -
cult to assess for all the parties involved. Gov -
ernment debt has risen sharply and continu -
ously in the industrial countries. In the public debate, this has to a certain extent aroused 
fears of rising inflation rates in future. In fact, 
there are theoretical considerations which sug -
gest that such a connection exists. In the past, 
there have been frequent phases where high sovereign debt and high rates of inflation ac -
companied each other. There are, however, 
also a number of examples where this was not 
the case: government debt in Japan, for in -
stance, rose from 80% of GDP in 1994 to over 200% in 2012, whereas the price level declined 
slightly during this same period. It would ap -
pear that the links between government debt 
and inflation are of a more complex nature.

of theoretical considerations and describes how the relationship between government 
debt and inflation has developed in the United 
States since the beginning of the 20th century. 
According to this article, there is much to sug -
gest that confidence in an independent and 
stability-  conscious centr al bank is an important 
–  al beit not a sufficient – condition for ensuring 
that high government deficits do not have an 
adverse impact on inflation expectations, which 
will tend to make future consolidation neces -
sary purely on account of public finances.Long-  term

13 By contrast, tail risks are more likely to be underesti -
mated in the ECB’s SPF as the survey participants tend to 
enter a probability of zero for intervals with just a small 
probability.14 Owing to the lack of unambiguity when determining a 
density distribution for five to ten years, it is not possible to 
derive a forward rate in the same way as for inflation-  
indexed bonds and inflation swaps.
15 One example would be the attempt to achieve higher 
inflation targets in order to lower the real value of govern-
ment debt. Market participants can learn how to see 
through such a strategy and how to react accordingly with 
interest rate premiums. This is shown in, for example,

The long- run relationship between public defi  cits and 
 infl  ation in various economic models
The notion that high budget defi  cits in the 
public sector can drive infl  ation higher over 
a medium or long- term horizon has been demonstrated by a number of theoretical 
models used in economic research circles.1 
The different research papers all have one 
idea in common – that it is not public def-
icits by themselves but the interaction be-tween fi  scal and monetary policy which  dictates whether public defi  cits exert an 
 infl  ationary infl  uence.
The concept underlying the models cover-
ing this topic can be illustrated with the aid 
of the following simplifi  ed government 
budget restraint
where Bt represents nominal outstanding 
government debt, Pt the current price level, 
st (real) government primary surpluses,2 
∆Mt denotes seignorage, ie government 
earnings from the issuance of money, and /u1D6FD 
represents the discount factor. The equa-
tion states that the real value of outstand-
ing debt must be commensurate with the 
present value of the government’s expected net revenue. This line of thought eliminates the possibility of the government becoming insolvent and thus being unable to repay its 
debt. In a conventional regime –  one in which monetary policy controls infl  ation 
(and thus seignorage is determined) – it is 
up to fi  scal policy to ensure that the real 
debt level is stabilised by future primary sur-
pluses st , which it can do either by raising 
taxes or reducing government spending in 
the future. This is known as monetary dom-inance. However, a situation in which fi  scal policymakers are either unwilling or unable 
to generate the necessary future primary surpluses –  or economic agents do not 
 expect this to happen – is dubbed a regime of fi  scal dominance, assuming that monet-ary policy ensures the solvency of the gov-
ernment. The method used to map fi  scal dominance varies from one model to the next, depending on which market is as-
sumed to be the one which determines the 
price level. If the price level is only deter-
mined in the money market, it is ultimately 
monetary policy which dictates the price 
and infl  ation level. Should fi  scal policymak-
ers  decide to continue to run primary def-
icits, spending will need to be funded through additional borrowing. If neither monetary nor fi  scal policy relents initially, debt will grow faster than the economy. Leaving aside the possibility of sovereign default, this means that in the long run, monetary policy will have to generate higher seignorage profi  ts after all. At the 
end of the day, this implies higher infl  ation 
rates going forward and –  because eco-
nomic agents are aware of this – it already 
drives up infl  ation expectations at the cur-
rent juncture. If the price level is not neces-sarily determined in the money market, the current price level – assuming a given level of future primary surpluses and seignorage 
profi  ts – adapts to ensure that future real primary balances and seignorage profi  ts cover the current real debt level. For in-
stance, infl  ation might conceivably rise be-

penditure and seignorage revenue.Deutsche Bundesbank

cause holders of nominal government debt 
securities, perceiving themselves to be 
wealthier, increase their spending, but the higher infl  ation is not dampened by those 
economic agents whose tax burden will be higher in the  future. This second scenario is also referred to in the literature as the “fi  s-cal theory of the price level”.
3
Regardless of their individual design, all 
these models agree that it is the interaction 
between monetary and fi  scal policy which 
is crucial for price stability. Ultimately, sound 
fi  scal policymaking is a key prerequisite for 
monetary policy to serve its purpose of 
safeguarding price stability. Conversely, this would suggest that monetary policymakers are deprived of any means of controlling in-fl  ation in a fi  scal dominance regime. Under 
these circumstances, higher public defi  cits 
go hand in hand with higher infl  ation rates over the long term.
However, the model results are quite a con-
troversial topic and there is a lively aca-
demic debate about whether the fi  ndings are consistent with reality. While the rela-tionship between public defi  cits and infl  a-tions in developed economies is disputed, 
emerging market economies – all of which exhibit higher infl  ation rates – have already 
been the subject of empirical research 
which has found that defi  cits positively in-
fl  uence infl  ation and infl  ation expectations.4
Against this backdrop, a more recent study5 
investigates the long- run relationship be-tween public defi  cits and infl  ation in the USA across a relatively long period (from 
1900 until 2011), focusing primarily on po-
tential variations in this relationship over time.
 The researchers estimate a vector- 
autoregression model with time- varying 
parameters and stochastic volatilities. Spe-
cifi  cally, the paper explores the relationship between infl  ation and primary defi  cits over government debt.
6 The ratio of primary def-
icits to government debt can be interpreted 
directly as the change in outstanding gov-
ernment liabilities to creditors, and it is in-
fl  uenced primarily by fi  scal policy itself over 
the long term. Besides these variables, the 
model incorporates monetary growth and real economic growth as well as a short- term interest rate to take account of any 
interactions with these variables. The time- 
varying long- run relationship between pri-
mary defi  cits over government debt and in-
fl  ation is quantifi  ed following the estimate 
with the aid of a spectral analysis. The key 
fi  nding is depicted by the solid black line in the chart on page 75.
This outcome illustrates that, with the ex-ception of a brief spell following the First 
World War and in the years surrounding the 
Great Depression, there was a clearly posi-
tive long- run relationship between the two 
variables up until roughly 1980. It is also evident that the long- run relationship did 
not follow a clear- cut trend in the fi  rst half 
of the past century, which contrasts with the broadly upward tendency observed in the period immediately following the Second World War. The long- run relation-ship between public defi  cits and infl  ation suddenly diminished after 1979 and has 
 remained insignifi  cantly different from zero 
ever since. Another interesting observation 
is that the strongest long- run relationships

between the two variables were measured 
between the mid-1960s and the end of the 
1970s – a period in which defi  cits were not exceptionally high.
A historical decomposition of the long- run 
relationship between public defi  cits and in-
fl  ation can offer deeper insights into these 
observations. Assuming a recursive identifi  -
cation, the authors calculate which struc-
tural exogenous shocks are behind this out-
come. The grey areas in the above chart  illustrate that the bulk of the increase 
 between 1960 and 1980 was primarily at-
tributable to monetary policy. This era of US 
monetary policy has often been described as not being independent of fi  scal policy, 
which is consistent with this outcome.7 This 
independence was only restored at the turn 
of the 1980s, Paul Volcker’s appointment 
generally being regarded as a turning point in US monetary policymaking.
8It is therefore reasonable to assume that a 
change in monetary policy has played a cru-
cial role in creating, and destroying, the long- run relationship between public def-icits and infl  ation. The authors conducted 
counterfactual analysis to rule out the pos-
sibility that both events only occurred as a 
result of specifi  c shocks during the 1970s – 
the oil price shocks, say, or the collapse of 
the Bretton Woods system. Counterfactual 
analysis assumes that the economic model’s 
endogenous reaction to structural exogen-
ous shocks remained stable across the en-
tire time period and that only the structural shocks changed over time. The above chart 
exemplifi  es how the long- run relationship 
between public defi  cits and infl  ation would 
have turned out if the economy had re-sponded to structural shocks across the

Conclusions
The global economic crisis of the past few 
years has presented considerable challenges for 
monetary policy. A great number of years have 
passed since the global economy was faced 
with a crisis on a similar scale, which makes it difficult to apply the lessons learnt back then to 
the situation today. However, it has become 
evident that the shock which was initially trig -
gered by problems in isolated markets and which later spilt over to the financial system, together with a number of other weaknesses 
that came to light as a result, placed a consid -
erable strain on the real economy. The crisis 
also made it more difficult for central banks to fulfil their function as the relationships between 
inflation and certain benchmarks, such as the 
output gap and the natural rate of unemploy -
ment, have changed or have become even 
more uncertain. Communication with the gen -
eral public also became more complicated as a result. This was compounded by the fact that 
central banks implemented a number of new instruments in some cases as the traditional interest rate policy reached its limits. The ef -
fectiveness of these new instruments remains largely untested, however. Against this back -
drop, it is remarkable that the rates of price change did not deviate more seriously from 
their target rates. There is much to suggest that the central banks have gained enough credibil-
ity in the past as a result of their stability-  
oriented policies and were therefore successful 
in anchoring the inflation expectations, which 
also helped them to contain the deviations of 
the actual inflation rates from the target rate 
within reasonable limits. This credibility is due, 
not least, to the successes achieved in ensuring 
price stability and an institutional framework which has enabled central banks to pursue 
their stability policies in an unrestricted manner. Looking ahead, it will remain crucial for central banks to maintain this credibility.Anchoring of 
 
inflation expect -
ations requires a sound fiscal 
 policy 
in the 
long run entire time period as it had done in 1995. 
The outcome of the analysis illustrates that 
the disappearance of the long- run relation-ship between post-1980 public defi  cits and 
infl  ation was indeed attributable to a 
change in US monetary policy and its inter-
action with fi  scal policy. Regardless of the 
structural shocks prior to 1980, a long- run 
relationship between the variables would 
not have been evident if the monetary pol-icy stance adopted in the 1980s and 1990s had already been in place before 1980. The research also indicates that if monetary and fi  scal policy interacted today as it had done 
in the 1970s, then a long- run relationship 
between the variables would come to light.
All in all, the empirical fi  ndings for the USA 
show how important the interaction be-
tween monetary and fi  scal policy is for the 
long- run relationship between infl  ation and public defi  cits. It can generally be concluded that stable and sustainable public fi  nances 
are a key factor underpinning a stability- oriented monetary policy. The latter is fre-quently pressurised to put its stability ob-jective aside whenever there is a growing belief that the sustainability of public 
 fi  nances is coming under threat. This might 
trigger an undesired upturn in infl  ation  expectations, hampering monetary policy-
making further still. Given that neither high infl  ation as a means of safeguarding sover-eign solvency nor a sovereign default are a 
desirable macroeconomic outcome, a sus-tainable fi  scal policy which is geared to 
 ensuring robust public fi  nances is a crucial 
prerequisite for keeping the economy on a steady growth path.Deutsche Bundesbank

system’s monetary aggregates should on no account be interpreted as national accordance with the accounting regime chosen by the Eurosystem (see also footnote
monetary aggregates and are therefore not comparable with the erstwhile German 2 on banknote circulation in Table III.2).
