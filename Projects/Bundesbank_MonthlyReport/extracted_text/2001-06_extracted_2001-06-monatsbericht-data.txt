5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Economy as a wholeOverall output went up somewhat more
sharply at the start of 2001 than it had donein the preceding months. After adjustmentfor seasonal and working-day variations, first-quarter real gross domestic product (GDP)was 0.4% up on its level in the autumnmonths, at which time the rate of growthhad been 0.2%. Compared with the sameperiod last year, overall output rose by 2.1%,adjusted for the differing number of workingdays, and by 1.6% in calendar-month terms.The main reason for the higher level of out-put was the increase in industrial production,which benefited from the large stocks oforders that had built up previously. Despitedeclining exports, there was an increase innet trade, since imports were cut back con-siderably in real terms during the sameperiod. Domestic investment in machineryand equipment also made a notable contribu-tion to growth. By contrast, declining con-struction activity placed a heavy strain on theeconomy. Private consumption still lackedbuoyancy. The available indicators suggestthat overall economic growth remained verysubdued in the spring months.
ManufacturingSeasonally adjusted, there was a further de-
cline in new manufacturing orders, for ex-ample. In particular, there was less ordering ofcapital goods, whereas demand for manufac-tured consumer goods was roughly consistentwith the average level of the first quarter. De-GDP in

6mand for intermediate goods was also some-
what weaker than before. Overall, orders fellby 1
12% on the year. While it was mainly
from abroad that fewer orders were receivedover the past few months, with domesticorders showing only a marginal decline, therewas a smaller year-on-year fall in foreignorders, since comparatively few export ordershad been received in April 2000.
In seasonally adjusted terms, industrial output
– following the orders situation with a timelag – showed a further sharp fall in April. Ac-cording to the provisional figures, this stillrepresented a rise of 3
14% on the year. On
an average of the first quarter, however, thefigure had been nearly 7%.
ConstructionConstruction output picked up a little in
April, after reaching a new low in March. Inyear-on-year terms (although this informationis subject to qualifications until the figures areadjusted to the annual overall survey), thedecline slowed down to around 14% at theend of the period under review.
In March (more recent data are unavailable at
present), there was a slight fall again in de-mand for construction work. Although indus-trial clients stepped up their orders, there wasless demand from the public sector. Therewere no major changes in residential con-struction. Overall, the level was a total of al-most 11% down over 12 months.Economic conditions in Germany*

7Labour market
The slowdown in the pace of economic
growth has spread comparatively rapidly tothe labour market. In seasonally adjustedterms, since December there has been no fur-ther rise in the number of persons in work.For March (more recent data are unavailableat present), the employment figure showed ayear-on-year increase of 290,000, comparedwith as many as 365,000 in February.
In May, there was a further seasonally adjust-
ed rise in the number of persons out of work.At the end of the period under review, thefigure was 3.83 million, i.e. 70,000 fewerthan one year earlier, but 60,000 more thanat the end of 2000. The seasonally adjustedunemployment rate remained unchanged at9.3%. One contributory reason for this wasthat the number of persons in work in therate’s denominator was adjusted to the fig-ures of last year’s labour force survey. Season-ally adjusted, the EU-standardised unemploy-ment rate went up from 7.7% to 7.8%.
In May, more persons were taking part in ac-
tive labour market policy measures than inApril. A somewhat greater amount of fundswas spent on both vocational training andjob creation measures. There was also a high-er number of participants in the additional as-sistance programmes provided by the FederalLabour Office.
PricesIn the past few weeks, there has been a fur-
ther sharp rise in crude oil prices on the inter-national markets. For a time, a barrel of Brent
North Sea Oil cost almost US$ 30. On amonthly average, crude oil prices in Maywere nearly 10% up on their level inApril. Speculation about a shortage in fuel-processing capacities, especially in NorthAmerica, intensified the price climate. Anadditional factor was a renewed weakness ofthe euro.
For that reason, energy became 2.2% more
expensive for consumers in May. The rate ofincrease in consumer prices was additionallybeing driven up by BSE and foot and mouthdisease as well as by crop failures in the caseof vegetables and potatoes due to poor wea-ther conditions. Overall, food was 1.4%more expensive than in April in seasonally ad-justed terms. By contrast, there was scarcelyany change in the prices of manufacturedgoods and only minor rises in rents. Even so,consumer prices rose by a seasonally adjustedtotal of 0.4% from April to May. The year-on-year rate of increase went up to 3.5%.Measured by the Harmonised Index of Con-sumer Prices (HICP), the loss of purchasingpower amounted to 3.6%.
Under the impact of energy prices, the sea-
sonally adjusted cost of imports rose sharplyin April (more recent information is unavail-able at present). The year-on-year rate of in-crease accelerated from 4.2% to 5.1%. Ger-man industry, too, charged higher domesticprices in April. The 12-month rate of increasein industrial producer prices was 5.0% at theend of the period under review. Excluding en-ergy sources, the figure was 2.3%.

8Public finance
Government indebtednessGovernment indebtedness remained un-
changed in April on balance after having in-creased by almost 34
12billion in March. The
Federal Government and the Länder Govern-ments showed sharply divergent develop-ments. Whereas the Länder Governmentstapped the credit markets to the extent of justunder 35
12billion net, the Federal Govern-
ment reduced its liabilities by almost 35 billion;
this was due exclusively to a decrease by 36
billion in money market indebtedness. The netredemptions on the part of the Federal Govern-ment were made possible by the Bundesbank’sprofit transfer for the financial year 2000. TheFederal Government’s limited borrowing in thecapital market centred on a new issue of Treas-ury discount paper. With a gross sales total ofjust over 36
12billion, this increased the volume
outstanding by almost 32 billion. The gradual
topping-up of this short-term borrowing instru-ment can be seen as a partial compensation forthe redemption of floating-rate liabilities of theCurrency Conversion Equalisation Fund thanksto the UMTS proceeds.
The new borrowing of the Länder Govern-
ments was dominated by the issuance ofTreasury notes and the raising of short-termbank loans totalling approximately 32
12bil-
lion in each case. In addition, loans againstborrowers’ notes yielded just under 3
12bil-
lion net for the Länder Governments. The ERPSpecial Fund and the “German Unity” Fundreduced their indebtedness marginally, withthe former, in particular, redeeming bankloans by almost 3
12billion. Local government
debt may have grown slightly in April.
Federal Government borrowingIn May, the Federal Government resorted to
the capital markets to a significantly greaterextent, borrowing over 312 billion gross. By
contrast, it cut its money market debt, as inApril, albeit only slightly. A comparison of itsmonth-end figures, however, is less meaning-ful since, in the context of the Federal Gov-ernment’s liquidity management operations,the volume of these short-term bridgingloans is subject to significant fluctuationseven within the time span of a month. TheFederal Government’s overall indebtedness,after deducting the relatively large redemp-tions, increased by 31 billion.Net borrowing in the market

9In gross terms, the single largest item of bor-
rowing was the issuance of a ten-year Federalbond ( Bund ), which procured 35
12billion for
the Federal Government. This was a littlemore than was required for the refinancing ofa 1991 bond maturing in May. A comparisonof the coupons of the two bonds (5% and8.375%, respectively) shows how the lowinterest rate level is continuing to have a re-straining effect on interest expenditure. Atjust over 35 billion, the proceeds from the
sale of five-year special Federal bonds ( Bobls )
were likewise quite sizeable. Just over 34
12
billion of this was due to the topping-up of a
tender issue. Bobls were concurrently re-
deemed in the amount of 34 billion. The sum
of just under 31 billion was yielded by sales
of Federal Treasury note stocks set aside formarket management operations. The decline(by31 billion) in the outstanding volume of
Federal savings bonds continued a trendwhich has been apparent for quite some timenow. The same applies to the accrued total ofloans against borrowers’ notes, which de-clined slightly.
Securities markets
Bond marketIn April, domestic borrowers issued bonds to
the market value of 357.4 billion, compared
with 364.3 billion in March. While redemp-
tions remained virtually constant, net turn-over from the sale of domestic bonds was, at35.0 billion, down by more than half com-
pared with the previous month. 39.0 billion
net worth of foreign bonds were placed inthe German market; two-thirds of these
bonds were denominated in euro. Net salesof domestic and foreign bonds amounted to313.9 billion in April, well below the level of
the previous month ( 321.2 billion).
In April, the public sector increased its
bonded debt by 32.8 billion. The Federal
Government raised funds in the bond marketamounting to 31.4 billion. On balance, this
was achieved almost exclusively by sellingshort-dated paper. It issued short-term Treas-ury discount paper ( Unverzinsliche Schatzan-
weisungen, known as Bubills ) in the amount
of36.6 billion, although net of redemptions,
the amount of these bonds outstanding in-creased by 31.9 billion. 30.8 billion worth of
two-year Federal Treasury notes and 30.2 bil-
lion worth of 30-year bonds were sold, whileFederal Government borrowing in the

bonds were redeemed. By contrast, the out-standing amount of ten-year Federal bondsand five-year special Federal bonds hardlychanged.
1In addition, 31.0 billion worth of
bonds of the former Deutsche Bundespost– which ceased to issue paper on the bondmarket in its own right – were redeemed. TheLänder Governments sold bonds amountingto32.4 billion net in April.
In April, credit institutions raised 31.2 billion
net from the sale of their own debt securities,compared with 33.9 billion in March. These
were mainly communal bonds ( Öffentliche
Pfandbriefe ) and debt securities issued by
specialised credit institutions, at 30.6 billion
and 30.5 billion respectively. Other bank
debt securities were sold in the amount of30.2 billion. The amount of mortgage bonds
(Hypothekenpfandbriefe ) outstanding in the
market declined by 30.1 billion. Net sales of
industrial bonds were, at 31.0 billion, well
below the level of the previous month ( 32.6
billion).
Gross sales by German-managed syndicates
of Deutsche Mark/euro bonds issued by non-residents amounted to 30.6 billion in April
(30.3 billion in March). After deducting
redemptions, the amount outstanding wasdown by 31.9 billion.
On the buyers’ side of the bond market, do-
mestic credit institutions were in the forefrontin April. They enlarged their bond portfoliosby311.5 billion, 36.9 billion of which was
accounted for by foreign paper and 34.6 bil-
lion by domestic securities. Domestic non-banks increased their holdings of fixed-interest securities by 37.2 billion. However,
this took place against a background of ex-tensive portfolio reallocations. Non-bankssold bank debt securities and industrial bondsin the total amount of 35.1 billion and pur-
chased 310.3 billion worth of public sector
bonds and 32.0 billion worth of paper issued
by non-residents. Non-resident investors re-duced their holdings of domestic bonds by34.8 billion, selling public sector debt secur-
ities only.Sales and purchases of bonds

11Equity market
In April, domestic enterprises placed new
shares in the German equity market to themarket value of 31.0 billion – slightly less
than in the previous month ( 31.1 billion).
Foreign equities to a value of 311.9 billion
were placed, with the result that overall salesof equities amounted to 312.8 billion.
Domestic credit institutions were predominant
on the buyers’ side of the equity market inApril. They purchased shares to the value of313.9 billion (net); as in the previous month,
these consisted mainly of domestic paper. Do-mestic non-banks reduced their shareholdingsby32.8 billion. On balance, they sold only do-
mestic paper (– 310.5 billion), while adding
foreign equities to their portfolios ( 37.7 bil-
lion). In April, non-residents bought 31.8 bil-
lion worth of German shares.
Investment fund certificatesAt34.3 billion, the amount raised by domes-
tic investment funds was distinctly higher inApril than in the previous month ( 31.5 bil-
lion). Funds open to the general public placed32.7 billion net of certificates. Roughly one-
half of these funds ( 31.3 billion) accrued to
share-based funds. Money market funds andopen-end real estate funds raised 30.6 billion
and 30.4 billion respectively. Mixed funds
and bond-based funds were less favoured byinvestors, attracting inflows of capital in theamount of 30.1 billion net each. The out-
standing amount of certificates of pension in-vestment mutual funds ( Altersvorsorgefonds )
remained virtually unchanged. 31.6 billionnet (March: 30.5 billion) was invested in spe-
cialised funds. In April, 32.1 billion worth of
foreign investment fund certificates were soldin the German market.
Investment fund certificates were purchased,
on balance, solely by residents ( 36.5 billion).
Non-banks increased their portfolios of do-mestic and foreign investment fund certifi-cates by 34.0 billion and 31.8 billion respect-
ively. Credit institutions bought 30.7 billion
worth of investment fund certificates. Non-residents sold domestic investment fund cer-tificates amounting to 30.2 billion.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account – the combined
outcome of foreign trade, services, factor in-come and current transfers – ran a surplus of31.5 billion in April. This means that the sur-
plus was about half of what it had been inthe previous month ( 33.1 billion). A sharp
decline in the trade surplus was the main rea-son for this result.
According to calculations by the Federal Stat-
istical Office, there was a surplus of 35.2 bil-
lion on trade in goods in April compared withone of 38.9 billion in March. Even after the
elimination of seasonal influences the tradesurplus was still much below the level it hadreached in the previous month. A sharp rise(of 10%) in the import of goods was theprincipal factor in this development althoughthe increase has to be seen in relation to thevery considerable reduction in the monthearlier.

12gether, imports fell by just over 212% com-
pared with the previous two-month period(January-February). Although there was aslight increase (of 2
12%) in the exports of
goods in April compared with the previousmonth, the result for the two-month periodof March-April likewise represented a decline(of 1
12%) compared with the first two
months of the current year.
In the case of invisible current transactions
with non-residents the deficit went downfrom 35.4 billion in March to 33.1 billion in
April. This was due primarily to lower net ex-penditure on services ( 32.4 billion compared
with 35.4 billion in March). Net expenditure
also fell in the case of current transfers tonon-residents (to 32.1 billion from 32.7 bil-
lion in March). By contrast, factor income,which is subject to fairly sharp monthly fluc-tuations, was marked by a decline in net re-ceipts ( 31.4 billion in April compared with
32.6 billion in the month before).
The financial account saw large outflows of
funds as a result of cross-border portfoliotransactions in April. All in all, net capital ex-ports in this segment amounted to 323.8 bil-
lion compared with 36.3 billion a month earl-
ier. German residents stepped up their invest-ment in foreign securities by 320.6 billion
(March: 32.0 billion). Among their acquisi-
tions were foreign shares worth 39.5 billion
and foreign bonds worth 38.2 billion. By
contrast, non-resident investors again with-drew funds from the German market ( 33.2
billion in April compared with 34.3 billion in
March). It was particularly in money marketpaper ( 33.1 billion) and in bonds and notesMajor items of the balance

non-residents predominated. In April foreignpurchases were observed only on the sharemarket and amounted to a modest 31.7 bil-
lion.
In contrast to portfolio transactions, cross-
border transactions as a result of direct invest-ment virtually cancelled out. German enter-prises invested about 31.5 billion in their sub-
sidiaries abroad in April. Foreign proprietorsprovided their subsidiaries in Germany withmore or less the same amount whereas inMarch they had withdrawn 315.0 billion
from the German market.
Enterprises and individuals imported 34.0 bil-
lion (net) through statistically recorded unse-curitised credit transactions in the periodunder review; the raising of long-term loans
abroad was the dominant factor here. Bycontrast, external transactions by the publicsector resulted in net outflows of 31.3 bil-
lion. The German banking system, whose ac-counts reflect, as it were, the remaining ex-ternal payments, absorbed foreign fundsworth 318.0 billion net in April. For example,
39.8 billion net accrued to German credit in-
stitutions in the month under review whilethe net external position of the Bundesbank(excluding foreign reserves) fell by 38.2 bil-
lion. Of particular importance here were bal-ances arising in connection with the paymentsystem TARGET.
The foreign reserves of the Bundesbank – at

15Overall financial
flows in 2000The corporate sector, in particular, had
a major impact on overall financialflows in Germany last year. Firstly, com-paratively strong economic growthwas accompanied by a significant ex-pansion of industrial investment. Sec-ondly, there arose a considerable needfor funds for the acquisition of mobiletelephone licences. Both of these fac-tors resulted in a sharp rise in the vol-ume of external financing. Generalgovernment had a substantially easingimpact in 2000. Owing to the large-scale proceeds from the auction ofUMTS licences and its continuing con-solidation efforts, this sector – whichtraditionally relies to a major extent onthe capital market – was able to reduceits net level of debt for the first time insome while. Despite a continuing sub-dued propensity to save, households– which form the “classical” area ofsurplus in the flow of financing –significantly expanded their net supplyof capital. Declining residential con-struction activity meant that the com-paratively low level of demand forbank credit played a significant role inthis respect. Nevertheless, in aggregateterms, an external financial deficit wasagain apparent. Despite notable suc-cesses in exports, the deterioration inthe terms of trade has placed a strainon the German net external position.

16Basic pattern of the financial flows
Financial flows in 2000 were influenced by
the quite dynamic pace of economic growth.The sharp expansion in exports also left itsmark on domestic economic activity. Notleast owing to moderate wage agreementsand favourable terms of financing, there wasa significant rise in net investment by bothnon-financial corporations (including quasi-corporate enterprises) and by self-employedpersons and sole proprietors, who are nowclassified as belonging entirely to the house-hold sector under the new ESA. Stockbuildingby producing enterprises likewise generatedfairly strong stimuli. Government investmentbudgets, by contrast, showed a slight decline.
In 2000, there was an additional increase in
enterprises’ financing requirements due tothe purchases of UMTS licences. UnderESA 95, which now forms the basis of the na-tional accounts (and thus of the financialflows accounts) throughout the EU, suchtransactions are booked, from the point ofview of the licensee
1, as acquisitions less dis-
posals of non-financial non-produced assetsand are not recorded under investment;nevertheless, they do belong to the total ag-gregate of non-financial asset acquisition. Asa result of the auction of UMTS licences todomestic and foreign enterprises, this itemwas of an unprecedented magnitude. Previ-ously, transactions within this specific cat-egory had been confined to governmentsales of land to households and domestic en-terprises, which had been on a limited scalein terms of the economy as a whole. In 2000,domestic non-financial corporations – aboveall, those in the telecoms sector – invested
DM 67 billion in the acquisition of land andmobile telephone licences. Together withhouseholds’ purchases of land, expenditureamounted to just under DM 70 billion, thusraising the capital requirements of all the do-mestic sectors to around DM 380 billion, orslightly more than 11% of aggregate dispos-able income. Mirroring this, the governmentplaced a large part of the auction proceeds inthe short term with domestic and foreignbanks. Despite other, countervailing items,the government sector’s acquisition of finan-cial assets was thus extremely high at DM 90billion. Overall, the auction of UMTS licencesled to a significant shift in the net financialassets position of enterprises and the publicsector. The corporate sector incurred debtand the financial burden on government waseased. National saving remained unaffectedby this, however.
If all the items of investment spending on
non-financial asset acquisition which are rele-vant to financing are taken together, the risein the financing requirements of the domesticsectors in 2000 was on a significant scale.Simultaneously, the supply of capital in theform of domestic savings declined slightlydespite the favourable economic situation.The aggregate saving ratio, at 7.8% of dis-posable income of the domestic sectors, fellback almost to its low of 1996. This wasaround 1 percentage point down on the aver-age of the nineties, which were already char-acterised by a decline in the propensity to

18save. The gap between domestic non-
financial asset acquisition and domestic sav-ing was partially closed by German UMTS li-cences being purchased to the amount of justover DM 30 billion by foreign enterprises. Theremaining external financing deficit was com-paratively small, at
12% of domestic incomes:
the change in German net external assetswas on the same scale.
Domestic acquisition of non-financial
assets
In net terms, the domestic sectors’ invest-
ment in non-financial assets and inventorieslast year reached a value of DM 312 billion,or 9
12% of aggregate disposable income. In-
vestment expenditure was thus just over 7%up on 1999 in nominal terms. The amountwas, for the first time, greater than at the be-ginning of the early nineties, when invest-ment activity had experienced a boom as aresult of reunification. The net investmentratio at that time had, however, amounted toup to 12%. The main reason for the dynamicgrowth in investment during the periodunder review was, firstly, the sharp increase instockbuilding. At an amount of DM 46 bil-lion, it was just over DM 15 billion higherthan the previous 1999 record. Secondly, pro-ducing enterprises quite significantly steppedup their expenditure on machinery and equip-ment as well as other fixed assets, whichmainly comprise newly acquired computersoftware or software developed in-house.This accounted for roughly one-tenth ofequipment at the end of the period under re-view. Although there was a further decline ininvestment in industrial and commercial con-
struction, non-financial assets went up by10% overall on the year. The sectoral net in-vestment ratio thus amounted to just under5% of aggregate disposable income last year.
In contrast to the producing enterprises, the
other major sectors of the economy kepttheir investment budgets at a low level. Gov-ernment spending on infrastructure – in netterms – was no more than roughly one-seventh of the 1992 figures. Households’construction activity, which makes up by farthe largest item of private investment, wasalso cut back considerably at the end of theperiod under review. Business investment byself-employed persons and sole proprietors,by contrast, went up more or less as sharplyas investment by non-financial corporations.Overall, private investment was stagnatingduring the past five years at a volume ofsome DM 140 billion. There was thus a fur-ther decline in households’ net investmentratio to just over 4% of aggregate disposableincome.
National supply of savings
As mentioned earlier in this article, the trend
in national saving in 2000 ran counter to thedemand for capital and, less net capital trans-fers abroad, was marginally down, at DM 257billion, on the figure for the preceding year.This meant that the supply of funds of all thedomestic sectors amounted to just under 8%of aggregate disposable income. This time,the main reason for the renewed decline wasthe unfavourable development in the case of

19non-financial corporations. Their saving in the
form of net retained income showed a fall ofaround DM 20 billion on the year. Since cap-ital transfers received, in which investmentgrants are also included, rose only marginallyin net terms, aggregate available resourceswent slightly into minus figures. Added tothat was the fact that, at present, householdsare not giving a high priority to building upassets by forgoing consumption.
On the other hand, a stabilising influence was
exerted by the fact that, owing to the consoli-dation course pursued since 1997, govern-ment – unlike in previous years – no longerhad to “dissave”. Instead, for the first timesince 1991, general government last year re-corded a surplus of current receipts over con-sumption expenditure and current transferpayments.
2Given the fact that the taxes and
social security ratio was rising only slightly,this was mainly due to subdued spending. Inaddition to the improved situation on the la-bour market, the low interest-rate level andthe moderate pay agreement in the publicsector had a positive impact in this respect.Besides that, the continuing reduction instaffing levels meant that there was hardlyany increase in personnel costs. The improve-ment in “current saving” was not, however,sufficient to cover the significant capitaltransfers of around DM 43 billion net tohouseholds, enterprises and non-residents.This meant that general government – evenexcluding its investment expenditure – had afinancing requirement to cover. Even so, obvi-ous progress was apparent in this respect incomparison with previous years.In the choice of investment and financing in-
struments, the trend towards disintermedia-tion continued. Over the past few years,enterprises – above all, those which operateinternationally – have been bypassing thecredit institutions more and more and bor-rowing funds through their establishments orgroup headquarters abroad. Since the end ofthe nineties, equity financing has become in-creasingly important. On an average of theperiod from 1998 to 2000, it accounted forjust under one-quarter of all funds raised bythe non-financial sectors.
As in 1999, “classical” bank products suf-
fered losses in terms of financial asset acquisi-tion, too. Far fewer funds were placed intransferable deposits, and there were netwithdrawals from savings deposits and netredemptions of bank savings bonds.
Only time deposits showed a sharp increase.
As mentioned above, general governmentplayed a crucial part in this, although house-holds, too, placed more funds in time de-posits than in 1999. The rise in short-terminterest rates was one factor that is likely tohave led to many market players choosing in-vestments with a commensurate maturity.Participating interests, in a broader sense,were by far the most favoured form of invest-ment of the non-financial sectors, accountingfor almost one-half of their acquisition offinancial assets. In the early nineties, the com-parable figure was no more than about one-

20fifth. While government, in pursuing privat-
isation, continued to sell its participatinginterests, enterprises and households – des-pite the incipient weakness on the equitymarkets in spring – stepped up their positionsover the year as a whole. Firstly, there werenet direct purchases of shares, with the re-corded overall buying of shares by the non-financial sectors being distorted upwards inconnection with an international takeover inthe telecoms sector. Secondly, households
were particularly active in the indirect acquisi-tion of shares. The mutual funds shares whichwere purchased consisted mainly of units inshare-based funds. There were net sales ofshares in bond-based funds during 2000.
Non-financial corporations’ financing
requirements and sources of funds
The crucial factor in the German economy’s
domestic financing requirement in 2000 wasthe sharp increase in asset acquisition by pro-ducing enterprises. Non-financial and finan-cial asset acquisition combined went up by18% to DM 935 billion gross. The main partof this expansion was accounted for by thereal component, which showed a jump-rise –mainly as a result of the acquisition of UMTSlicences for around DM 67 billion by Germantelecoms. By contrast, the increase incorporate non-financial assets, in the nar-rower sense, was no more than just undertwo-thirds as high. Gross investment rose by8
12% in nominal terms compared with
1999, its share of total uses of funds amount-ing to just over one-half. In particular, the ex-tremely high level of stockbuilding played animportant role. What cannot be ruled out,however, is the possibility that these figuresare somewhat overstated owing to statisticalerrors and omissions, and that they will beadjusted downwards as part of the impend-ing national accounts revision. The dynamicdevelopment in non-financial assets wasmainly attributable to machinery and equip-ment, whereas industrial construction invest-ment was cut back for the fifth year in suc-DM

22cession. Although the principal focus was on
modernisation of the capital stock, capacity isalso likely to have been expanded, not leaston account of the favourable sales position,above all, in export-oriented manufacturing.
In terms of financial asset formation, domes-
tic producing enterprises stepped up their ac-quisition of participatory instruments – asthey had done in both 1998 and 1999. Theoverall figures were strongly affected by
one large-scale transaction, however. Slightlymore than one-fifth of aggregate asset for-mation in 2000 was accounted for by sharesand other equities. In the years before 1998,when this period of external corporategrowth started, the figure had been not evenone-tenth. As shown by the aggregate flowof funds statement for the non-financial cor-porate sector, compared with the two pre-ceding years there was a shift in purely statis-tical terms towards the acquisition of domes-tic participations in 2000. This contrastedwith external growth being focused on othercountries in 1998 and 1999. In a more de-tailed analysis, however, it becomes apparentthat, to a large extent, the acquisition ofdomestic equity ultimately conceals large-scale cross-border transactions. Shares ac-quired by non-residents in the takeover of aGerman telecommunications enterprise weretransferred to a newly established German“subsidiary”, a quasi-corporate enterprise.Thus, the statistical statement of direct sharepurchases by non-financial corporations isstrongly overstated as a result of this specialfactor.
In addition to the direct acquisition of partici-
pations, intra-group lending also has to be in-cluded in connection with global corporategrowth. In particular, the granting of tradeand financial credit to affiliates abroad hasbeen growing in importance for a number ofyears. At slightly more than DM 100 billion,or just over 10% of aggregate asset forma-tion, the peak reached in 1999 was far ex-ceeded. In 2000, the enterprises undertookconsiderable restructuring within the otherDM

23forms of investment, although the precise
motives are not always identifiable. For ex-ample, enterprises sold mutual funds shareson balance but acquired bonds. The higherinterest rates meant that enterprises boughtquite a large amount of money market paper,although interest-bearing time deposits wereliquidated and transferable deposits were in-creased.
Only just over one-third of enterprises’ finan-
cing needs was covered by internal funds lastyear. The internal financing ratio, at 36%,thus reached its lowest level since the start of1991. The main reason for this renewed de-cline was the sharp fall in retained profits.“Dissaving” reached a scale similar to that inthe first half of the nineties, when the un-favourable development of the economy haddepressed profits. The earnings position for2000 is, of course, to be rated as much bet-ter. This means that the driving force behindthe decline is more probably a change in theway in which profits are distributed in con-nection with the concept of shareholdervalue. Furthermore, the forthcoming tax re-form is likely to have influenced profit-distribution behaviour.
The decrease in internal financing linked to
the change in financing behaviour was morethan offset in 2000 by the external procure-ment of additional equity capital. This was,however, overstated owing to the above-mentioned large-scale transaction. Domestic-ally, the injection of equity capital was rough-ly on the multi-year average, albeit muchlower than in 1999. Sales of shares were af-fected by this, despite overall buoyant issuingactivity (which, however, slackened during
the course of the year). This is likely to beclosely connected to developments on thestock exchanges, which also led to plannedissues being deferred. The high level of non-residents’ participation in German quasi-corporate enterprises is primarily due to theabove-mentioned establishment of a branchof a foreign telecommunications enterprise.Since shares of the German enterprise thathad been taken over were transferred to this“subsidiary”, other participations, which arenow held by non-residents, had to be bookedaccordingly on the liabilities side of the “sub-sidiary”. Ultimately, this construction has ledto a considerable “balance sheet extension”.
Whereas equity financing was heavily affect-
ed by one special factor, there was a very ex-pansionary development in credit financingvia non-banks in line with the trend over thepast few years. In total, trade and financialloans amounted to slightly more than DM 270billion, i.e. just under 30% of aggregate fi-nancing. In the early nineties, this form offunding had accounted for no more thanroughly 5%. The dynamic growth was re-flected, above all, in loans from abroad. Sincedomestic lending was very subdued in 2000,borrowing from abroad grew almost as rapid-ly as the aggregate itself. This meant thatthese inflows more than doubled, as they haddone in 1999. This large rise, especially inlong-term borrowing, likewise has to be seenin the context of the acquisition of UMTS li-cences by domestic telecoms. A major factorin this respect is that funds were raised via fi-nancing subsidiaries on the capital markets

24abroad and passed on to Germany as
financial loans.
By contrast, “classical” loan financing via
banks became much less important in theperiod under review. Last year, bank loans didnot reach even one-third of the loans grantedby other groups of lenders. In 1999, when– for the first time since 1991 – there hadbeen less recourse to bank loans than otherloans, its share amounted to just under three-quarters. Even though 2000 is somewhat dis-torted owing to the special circumstancescaused by the UMTS licences, 1999 and2000, taken together, show that the inter-nationalisation of the economy also has last-ing implications for enterprises’ credit man-agement.
Over the last ten years, it has been possible to
identify changes in the balance sheet struc-tures of the corporate sector. These changesindicate a transformation in the investmentand financing habits of non-financial corpor-ations. Up to and including 1997, gross in-vestment in tangible fixed assets and inven-tories was by far the largest item. On aver-age, financial asset acquisition amounted to amere 20% of expenditure. Since 1998, thisarea of investment – driven by external cor-porate growth – has been perceptibly gainingin importance. Between 1998 and 2000, theacquisition of financial assets accounted fortwo-fifths of aggregate asset formation. Interms of the source of funds, there has beena sharp fall since 1998 in internally raisedfunds. Against that, equity capital fromabroad and lending by non-banks, especiallyfrom abroad, have become more importantduring roughly the same period. This is a re-
flection, firstly, of the fact that the concept ofshareholder value is becoming more andmore prevalent and, secondly, of the increas-ing international links of large German enter-prises.
Households’ investment and borrowing
behaviour
While there was a sharp expansion in the
sources and uses of funds in the corporatesector in 2000, these showed a decline in thecase of households. The cause of this did notlie in developments in the real economy, i.e.saving and investment, but rather in financialtransactions. “Contractionary” years of thiskind are not at all untypical in the financialsector as financial flows are more volatilethan saving and investment. This reflects thefact that financial asset acquisition and bor-rowing serve, to a certain extent, as buffersfor adjusting to changes in underlying eco-nomic conditions.
As in the three preceding years, households’
savings, which are the main source of funds,showed only a slight increase last year innominal terms, rising to DM 250 billion at theend of the period under review. This meantthat the saving ratio, as measured by dispos-able income, reached a new low of 9.8%.Ten years before, the figure had been justover 3 percentage points higher. If theequivalent values for capital consumption areincluded in the calculation – in line with inter-national practice – the (gross) saving ratio ismuch higher. At 15

26figure that is still notable by international
standards. Nevertheless, this gross method ofdisclosure refers less to the concept of in-crease in net worth than to the internal finan-cing potential. If the net capital transfersreceived (which now amount to not quiteone-tenth of total funds from own sources)are added to (current) savings, own investiblefunds amounted to slightly more thanDM 280 billion. This covered just over three-quarters of the total financial requirement.
The rest was obtained by households throughloans from banks and insurance enterprises.The level of external funds was thus muchlower than in the preceding years, when anannual average of DM 140 billion was raisedin this way. Whereas there was even an ex-pansion in the raising of short-term loans,there was an almost 50% drop in longer-term loans. Although a precise breakdowninto mortgage loans, commercial loans orcredit granted for consumption purposes ismade more difficult by statistical recordingproblems, the slump in lending business islikely to have been due mainly to the lowerdemand for housing loans.
In terms of the uses of funds, the cutbacks in
households’ spending on non-financial assetsand inventories, as well as purchases of landfrom the government, remained limited in2000, while much less was placed in financialasset acquisition than in 1999. Overall, assetacquisition was reduced to around DM 365billion, having been DM 420 billion in the pre-vious year. Developments in real assets werequite mixed, however. Construction activitywas cut back considerably, which was duenot only to the persistent imbalances on theeast German housing markets but also to thelow level of demand for owner-occupiedhousing in western Germany. This contrastedonce again with a quite dynamic pace ofgrowth in machinery, equipment and otherfixed assets. Overall, households’ net invest-ment amounted to just under DM 140 billion,or 5

27The aforementioned decline in financial asset
acquisition from just under DM 280 billion toDM 226 billion in 2000 – the lowest figuresince 1991 – was primarily to the detrimentof bank balances. Firstly, there was a dramaticcutback by almost DM 80 billion in savingsdeposits. Secondly, funds allocated to trans-ferable deposits were DM 55 billion down on1999. Time deposits were stepped up simul-taneously. Higher short-term interest rates arelikely to have been a major factor in this. Forthe first time since 1991, there was also a de-cline in the acquisition of financial assets withinsurance enterprises last year. Householdsplaced just under DM 10 billion less in insur-ance products. This was due, not least, to acertain “wait-and-see” attitude given the de-bate on introducing private capital-fundedold-age pension provision as well as to antici-patory effects in 1999, when a future aboli-tion of preferential tax treatment for life in-surance products had been under discussion.
According to the available figures, the enthu-
siasm for shares, which had prevailed in thefirst few months of 2000 and which subse-quently cooled gradually, was not reflected inan exceptionally high level of direct purchasesof shares. At just over DM 20 billion, theywere, in fact, down on the figure for 1999,although the level of direct acquisition wasstill much higher than in the years beforethat. This development – notwithstanding anumber of large issues during the year thatmet with wide interest – may have been dueto the fact that the desire to realise pricegains or to avoid a further loss of capitalowing to the mark-downs became greater inspring. On an annual average, however,households continued to show a marked
preference for acquiring shares indirectly bymeans of mutual funds shares. As an annualfigure, households placed almost DM 120 bil-lion in such certificates, which was two-fifthsmore than the already high level of sales in1999.
Around DM 150 billion was thus placed in
assets with an appreciation potential, i.e.more than 50% of financial asset acquisitionand, for the first time, more than was invest-ed in non-financial assets. The marked prefer-ence for financial products of this kind is alsorevealed by the very heavy demand, accord-ing to the available data, for comparativelynew products within bond acquisition whichhave a certain link to the equity markets,such as index-linked certificates or equity-linked bonds. Owing to statistical recordingproblems, this may also include purchases ofwarrants which, strictly speaking, ought to bebooked with financial derivatives.
A long-term comparison of households’ fi-
nancial asset acquisition over the past fivedecades reveals a number of underlyingtrends that are also likely to be indicative offuture investment behaviour in Germany.Since the sixties, aggregate financial asset ac-quisition has been moving within relativelynarrow bounds of between 11% to 13
12%
of disposable income. It was only in thefifties, owing to the short supply of financialresources in the years of reconstruction, thatthe inflows into financial assets were muchlower. Nevertheless, there have been far-reaching changes in the structure of invest-ment behaviour. When seen over a period ofFewer assets

2850 years, there has been an obvious trend
towards assets with insurance enterprises andinvestment – either directly or indirectly – insecurities. By contrast, interest-bearing bankdeposits have been losing in importance overthe same period. Significant ground has beenlost, in particular, by savings deposits, whichfor more than 30 years had been the predom-inant form of bank deposits.
The direct acquisition of securities cannot be
captured precisely in terms of numbers, sincemutual funds shares were also shown here upto the end of the eighties. Even so, it is appar-ent that, for a long time, direct acquisitiontended to be of secondary importance incomparison with bank deposits and insuranceproducts. In the past ten years, however, pur-chases of shares – starting from a very lowlevel – have undergone a sharp upturn.
Nevertheless, the percentage of shares in pri-vate financial asset acquisition was still some-what higher in the sixties, due to extensiveprivatisation of public sector enterprises, thanduring the entire past decade. The “winners”in this regard are mutual funds shares and in-surance investment. Taken together, these ac-counted for more than one-half of financialasset acquisition in the period from 1991 to2000. The fact that mutual funds shares weremuch preferred to direct purchases of bondsand shares may be explained by relatively lowtransaction and information costs as well asan integrated risk diversification. Insurance in-vestment (including elements of companypension schemes) has gained significant mar-ket shares only in the last 20 years, and nowaccounts for just over one-third of financialLong-term pattern of households’*

29asset acquisition. Apart from tax advantages,
this development is likely to have been, notleast, a reflection of an increase in privateold-age pension provision as a result of themany years of discussion about inevitablelimitations in payments in the statutory pen-sion insurance scheme.
It is, however, not possible to draw direct
conclusions from financial asset acquisitionabout the development of households’ finan-cial assets or, say, the financial assets accumu-lated for private old-age pension provision.Changes due to valuation adjustments have aconsiderable impact on the level of assets.This has been palpably demonstrated by thepast two years, albeit in a different direction.While more than 50% of the increase infinancial assets in 1999 was due to holdinggains resulting from the rise in share prices,financial assets grew at a slower pace overalllast year than the transaction-related in-crease. This was caused by price adjustmentsin the equity markets, which were ultimatelyreflected in the assets held. Valued at marketprices, shares held by households thus de-clined by just under one-tenth, but were stillsignificantly higher than the figure for 1998.Although there was an increase in the hold-ing of mutual funds shares, this was not onthe same scale as financial asset acquisition.Overall, financial assets at the end of 2000amounted to approximately just over DM 7trillion, which was virtually no higher than inthe previous year. After deducting liabilities,households held net financial assets of slightlymore than DM 4 trillion, which correspondedto the 1999 level.In relation to nominal disposable income,
which increased by 3% last year, financialassets have declined slightly, however. It isnot yet possible to ascertain how this findingfor Germany compares with conditions inter-nationally. So far, comparable data on assetsare available only up to 1999. These showthat financial assets in other industrial coun-tries – especially in the United Kingdom andthe United States, owing to the large propor-

31tion of shares – are at a much higher level
than in Germany. Conversely, non-financialassets (including durable goods) were rela-tively high in Germany owing to the stock ofreal estate
3. In terms of net worth at just
under six times disposable income, Germanhouseholds were thus able to narrow the gapconsiderably vis-à-vis the British and US level.Additionally, households in both of the coun-tries used for comparison displayed only aweak propensity to save from current income.What a comparison of this kind does not takeinto account, however, is the fact that themethods of funding old-age pension provi-sion in the countries in question have quitediffering significance, and that the “implied”government debt in the shape of futuredemographic strains is a particular factor inGermany.
It is not possible to tell directly from the assets
and liabilities statement what assets serve thepurpose of old-age pension provision, butcertain upper limits can be estimated usingthe available statistical data and by includingthe stock of real estate. Combining whatmay, in principle, be regarded as long-termassets (which also include claims arising from
company pension schemes), householdsagain significantly increased their assets de-fined in this way in 2000 as a result of trans-actions. There is, admittedly, a considerabledivergence among households in the abilityand/or propensity to make adequate savingprovision for retirement, as there is, above all,with regard to their assets
4. This is revealed,
in particular, by the latest Federal StatisticalOffice sample survey of income and expend-iture for 1998. The latest decisions on pro-moting company and private capital-fundedold-age pension provision favour lower andmiddle income earners to a greater extentand will therefore assist in the necessarystrengthening of long-term financial asset ac-quisition, and thus contribute to the secondand third pillar of old-age pension provision inGermany.
The tables accompanying this articleappear on the following pages.3Quality aspects and the level of housing prices play a
major role in this respect.
4What is important in this context – apart from the dis-
tinction between western and eastern Germany – is
whether reference is being made to the distribution of
net financial assets or to financial assets including real es-
tate holding. In addition to income, age and occupational
status (employee or self-employed) are also major deter-
minants of households’ level of assets.Necessity of

39Monetary develop-
ments in the euroarea since thebeginning ofmonetary unionThe euro-area money stock M3 initially
went up sharply at the beginning ofmonetary union. Sight deposits, in par-ticular, were replenished heavily. How-ever, as a result of the ECB GoverningCouncil gradually raising interest ratessince autumn 1999, monetary growthhas been slowing down markedly sincespring 2000. The real monetary over-hang that had been built up in thepast has now vanished. Therefore,there are currently no more inflation-ary risks emanating from the monetaryside. So far, though, monetary growthin the individual euro-area countrieshas been quite mixed; besides hetero-geneous financial market structuresand unequal positions in the businesscycle, national special factors alsoplayed a role. Owing to this hetero-geneity and to problems in the statis-tical recording of marketable compon-ents, monetary growth has not alwaysbeen easy to interpret. All the same,though, the Bundesbank’s own empir-ical studies have shown that the long-run demand for money in the euroarea is stable. In addition, the moneystock M3, despite its large share ofcomponents bearing market rates ofinterest, is sufficiently controllable. Tothat extent, this confirms the resultsobtained so far by the ECB. In the Euro-system’s monetary policy strategy, themoney stock justifiably plays a promin-ent role.

40Introduction
The broad money stock M3 is a prominent
feature of the Eurosystem’s monetary policystrategy. The Governing Council of the ECBdefined a reference value for M3 growthwhich, since the launch of monetary union,has been 4
12%. It is a yardstick used to as-
sess the ongoing development of the moneystock. In addition, it analyses a broad rangeof non-monetary indicators in terms of theirinformative value for future inflation dangers.
Monetary analysis seeks to identify factors ex-
plaining shorter-term monetary growth inorder to achieve a more precise estimation ofthe price effects of monetary aggregates. Tothat end, the monetary aggregate and itscomponents and counterparts are subjectedto institutional and descriptive scrutiny. Insome cases, an analysis of the structure anddynamics of national contributions to M3 mayalso provide useful information. In addition,econometric approaches are used to quantifythe economic determinants of money de-mand, such as interest-rate movements andcyclical movements. On that basis, indicatorscan be developed for assessing liquidity provi-sion, which can provide additional informa-tion on dangers to future price stability.
Monetary developments in the euro area
since the beginning of monetary union
Since European monetary union (EMU) was
launched at the beginning of 1999, growthin the money stock M3 has clearly exceededthe 4
12% reference value. Over the nearlytwo-and-a-half years since then, annual M3
growth has averaged roughly 512%.1In the
run-up to EMU, monetary growth had beenrelatively steady in the soon-to-be membercountries, only to pick up speed once theeuro was introduced. When monetary unionwas launched in January 1999, money hold-ings skyrocketed, continuing their stronggrowth until the second quarter of 2000. Thethree-month moving average of annualgrowth rates went up from 5.6% in the firstquarter of 1999 to 6.5% in the February-April 2000 period. Afterwards, the pace ofgrowth slowed down under the spell of theincremental short-term interest-rate hikes be-ginning in November 1999. As the year 2000came to a close, the three-month movingaverage of monetary growth was only 4.9%.Since then, it has held steady at this level forthe most part.
In the first year of European monetary union,
M3 growth was characterised especially bythe distinct increase in sight deposits. At thebeginning, major uncertainty regarding theintroduction of the euro and extensive repat-riation of Euro-market deposits invested out-side of the euro area were to blame (see alsopage 47).
2In addition, propensity to hold

the beginning of monetary union is quantified in: ECB,

41liquid forms of assets was promoted by the
temporary reduction in short-term interestrates in April 1999. With the interest-rateturnaround in November 1999 and the result-ant increase in the opportunity costs ofholding non-interest-bearing or low-interest-bearing overnight deposits, their contributionto monetary growth then underwent a sus-tained decline (see table on page 42). Thattrend was temporarily interrupted by expect-ations of interest-rate increases in spring2000, causing a brief and sharp rise in sightdeposits. Ultimately, though, sight deposits’contribution to M3 growth shrank from4
12percentage points in the third quarter of
1999 to 1 percentage point in the first quar-ter of 2001.Growth of currency in circulation outside the
monetary financial institutions sector (MFIsector) increasingly lost steam in the pastyear, too, after having recorded year-on-yeargrowth in December 1999 of just under8
12% in connection with Y2K. As of late, the
volume of coins and notes in circulation out-side the MFI sector in the euro area has been3% below its previous year’s level. Cash re-turning from other countries – particularly re-turn flows of D-Mark banknotes – in the run-up to monetary union probably contributedto that development.

421999. With interest rates rising as the end of
1999 approached, the interest-rate disadvan-tage of these deposits widened; consequent-ly, they were steadily reduced.
The development of M3 components bearing
little or no interest was partly offset by dia-metrically opposed developments in compon-ents bearing market-related interest rates. De-posits with an agreed maturity of up to twoyears were reduced over the course of 1999but were sharply increased in 2000 and thefirst quarter of 2001. Their contribution to M3growth rose from –
12percentage point in De-
cember 1999 to just under three percentagepoints in April 2001. Negotiable instrumentslikewise put a damper on monetary growth inthe first year of monetary union; it was onlyafter the turnaround in interest rates in thefourth quarter of 1999 that they contributed
to M3 growth. In the run-up to Y2K, Germanmoney market paper and short-term bankdebt securities were the focus of attention assafe, liquid forms of investment.
Purchases of negotiable paper by non-euro-
area residents pose a particular problem re-garding the correct statistical recording ofthe money stock. The money stock is de-signed to encompass only liquidity held ateuro-area MFIs by euro-area non-banks as de-posits and negotiable instruments. Depositsand short-term paper held by non-euro-arearesidents are not included.

At present, only money market fundshares/units held by non-euro-area residentswhich have been issued by euro-area MFIscan be sufficiently quantified, and not hold-ings of money market paper and short-termbank debt securities. Apparently money mar-ket fund shares/units were in great demandamong non-euro-area residents starting inmid-2000. This caused the attendant statistic-al distortion of the annual rate of M3 growthin 2000 to increase incrementally; as of latethis distortion had reached
12percentage
point (see chart on page 41).
The driving force behind monetary growth,
which was quite dynamic up to and intospring 2000, was a sharp increase in lendingto the private sector. Even in the run-up tomonetary union, falling lending rates and abrightening economic outlook led to a grad-ual increase in credit expansion. From theintroduction of the euro until and into thesecond quarter of 2000, growth rates forlending settled in at a persistently high leveldespite the fact that lending rates went backup. Between January 1999 and April 2000,outstanding loans to the private sector main-tained an average year-on-year increase of10% each month. Probable reasons includethe bright economic outlook, extensive directinvestment abroad financed by loans, corpor-ate mergers and acquisitions, and boomingreal-estate markets in some euro-area coun-tries. An additional factor was that in spring2000, private households, in particular,brought forward their taking up of housingloans in expectation of further increasesin lending rates. As the year progressed,
the continuing rise in the level of interestrates then caused lending to cool off con-siderably. Telecommunications companies’large demand for finance resulting from theauctioning-off of UMTS licences temporarilyinterrupted the slowdown in credit expan-sion, yet it did not alter the trend. As of late,the annual growth rate of lending was justshy of 8
12%.
By contrast, lending to the public sector has
tended to have a dampening impact on mon-etary developments since the introduction ofthe euro. Owing not least to strong economicgrowth and an attendant reduction in theneed for finance, loans to general govern-ment grew only moderately in the first year ofmonetary union. In the following year, gen-eral government, probably also due to pro-ceeds from the auctioning-off of UMTS li-cences, was able to reduce its loans slightly.Moreover, securitised lending to the publicsector went down distinctly.
Strong lending to the private sector in the
euro area contrasted with dynamic monetarycapital formation at the beginning of monet-ary union. The wait-and-see attitude of mar-ket participants in the run-up to the introduc-tion of the euro led to a strong catching-upeffect particularly in net sales of long-termbank debt securities; however, this effect hadalready dissipated by mid-1999 owing to aflat yield curve.

44term go back up distinctly. It was only tempor-
arily dampened by uncertainty at the begin-ning of 2000 concerning future interest-ratemovements. As the end of 2000 approached,though, expectations of interest-rate cuts anda renewed flattening of the yield curve causeddomestic MFIs’ willingness to invest over thelonger term to wane distinctly. The volatilesituation in the financial markets in spring2001 exacerbated those tendencies.
Owing to a substantial volume of direct in-
vestment and portfolio investment in non-euro-area countries, euro-area MFIs’ net for-eign liabilities have been falling nearly con-tinuously since the beginning of monetaryunion. They have been offset not just by adampening of the money stock and of mon-etary capital formation but also by an in-crease in credit expansion. However, the paceof outflows of funds has slackened over time,which means the 3170
12billion reduction in
net foreign liabilities in 1999 was followed bya decline of only 390
12billion in 2000.
Monetary developments in the individual
euro-area countries
Structure of national contributions to M3
and their counterparts at the beginningof monetary union
The in some cases pronounced heterogeneity
in monetary dynamics among the individualeuro-area countries was at the root of euro-area-wide developments. The varying signifi-cance of the individual components of themoney stock in each nation’s contributions aswell as of M3’s balance-sheet counterparts is
a reflection of national special features. Thus,upon entry into monetary union in January1999, the volume of D-Mark currency in cir-culation accounted for a disproportionatelylarge percentage of the total volume of cur-rency circulating in the euro area (see tableon page 45). Large foreign demand forD-Mark notes played a key role. In addition,the German contribution to M3 has beencharacterised by a disproportionately largeshare of savings deposits redeemable at anagreed notice of up to three months. Theonly negotiable instruments of which a sig-nificant volume was issued in Germany wereshort-term bank debt securities. By contrast,the share of money market fund shares/unitsand money market paper in euro-area hold-ings of negotiable instruments was compara-tively minor; in Germany, repo transactionsare virtually negligible.
4
The situation has been different in the majoreuro-area countries of France, Italy and Spain.The most prominent feature of the French con-tribution to M3 is the very high percentage ofmoney market fund shares/units. In Francethere has traditionally been a close substitu-tional relationship between money marketfund shares/units and overnight deposits(which are not allowed to bear interest), whichcan readily be invested in interest-bearing, rela-tively liquid money market fund shares/units atshort notice. In Italy and Spain, the major sig-nificance of repo transactions is a striking fea-ture; at the beginning of 1999, both countries

45accounted for a combined 75% of repo trans-
actions concluded between MFIs and non-MFIsin the euro area. In Italy this was joined by amajor preference for M1 components. For themost part, in the remaining euro-area countriesthe share of negotiable instruments was dis-proportionately great. In Luxembourg, in par-ticular, money market fund shares/units playeda major role, and in Ireland, but also in Belgiumand the Netherlands, short-term bank debtsecurities were important.
There are differences among euro-area coun-
tries regarding balance-sheet counterparts,too. Relative to its national share in M3, theGerman MFI sector at the beginning of monet-ary union accounted for a disproportionatelylarge share in euro-area lending to the privateand public sector. Monetary capital formation,which was likewise relatively high, formed the
counterweight; just under half of longer-termfunds deposited at banks in the euro areawere held by German MFIs. This is testimonyto the dominant role played by the bankingsystem in the German financial sector. By con-trast, French MFIs accounted for a relativelylarge percentage of lending to non-euro-areacountries. Lending to the domestic private sec-tor in Italy and Spain was disproportionatelylow compared to their national contributionsto M3. Unlike France, they additionally record-ed low levels of net external assets. In bothcountries, the relatively low level of assets-sidebusiness was accompanied by relatively weakmonetary capital formation at MFIs.National shares in the money stock M3 and its components

46Monetary dynamics in the euro-area
countries since the beginning ofmonetary union
Since the beginning of monetary union, both
the structure of national contributions andtheir significance to the euro-area aggregatehave shifted. National special factors such asthe repatriation of Euro-deposits in Germanyor lasting portfolio shifts in Italy have been thehallmark of structural change in the nationalcontributions. Besides the national special de-velopments, differences in countries’ locationin the business cycle and the interest-rate sen-sitivity of the national contributions have beenresponsible for the divergence in the monetarydynamics of the euro-area countries.
With the increase in short-term interest rates
at the end of 1999, monetary growth wasstifled particularly in those countries holdinga relatively large share of components bear-ing either little or no interest, since in thosecases interest-rate hikes caused a higher-than-average increase in the opportunitycosts of holding money. The increase in theGerman, Belgian and Italian contributionswas below average.

*The sum of national shares in the counterparts does not always
add up to 100 %, since positions held by the ECB enter into theconsolidated MFI balance sheet for the euro area. This is quanti-tatively important, in particular, for the net external position asan element of assets-side business and own capital as an elementof monetary capital formation; at the end of 2000 the ECB heldcapital and reserves, including provisions and proceeds from reva-luation, as well as a surplus for the year, all of which added up to516.6 billion.

5Whereas an increase in the short-term interest rate in
Germany, Belgium, Austria and the Netherlands appar-
ently helps to dampen monetary growth, it stimulates
the growth of national contributions to M3 in France,
Spain and Italy, at least in the short run. A comparative
analysis of national contributions is contained in: Dedola,

47In addition to the development of interest
rates, the heterogeneous conjunctural situ-ation is likely to have had varying impacts onmonetary growth in the individual euro-areacountries. One sign is that the countries withthe strongest real growth are largely alsothose whose national contributions havegrown the fastest. Besides divergences interms of the real economy, differences in theincome elasticity of the demand for moneyalso play a role; it is especially high in Portugaland Spain, as well as in Belgium and theNetherlands.
6
The conjunctural differences have also con-tributed to the sometimes heterogeneous de-velopment in lending to the private sector.Lending to enterprises and individuals rosemore sharply than the euro-area average notonly in Spain and Portugal but also, and inparticular, in the Netherlands and Ireland. Inboth countries, a sharp rise in real-estateprices, particularly in 1999, was also partly toblame. Outflows of funds to non-euro-areacountries dampened the influence on monet-ary growth being exerted by credit expansion,particularly in the Netherlands. Yet GermanMFIs’ net external assets likewise declinedmarkedly since the beginning of monetaryunion, reflecting, among other things, exten-sive purchases of foreign securities by Ger-man non-banks. By contrast, Ireland, Austriaand Luxembourg recorded net inflows offunds from non-euro-area countries.
Moreover, national special developments had
an influence on the varying intensity of mon-etary growth in the euro-area countries (seechart on page 48).
7They are partly effects re-lated directly to entry into monetary union. In
Germany the euro-area-wide introduction ofinterest-bearing minimum reserves initially ledto a massive repatriation of short-term fundshitherto invested in the Euro-market to theGerman banking system. Private Germannon-banks’ short-term deposits held with for-eign branches and subsidiaries of Germanbanks went down by 325.4 billion, or
26
12%, over the course of 1999. Under the
assumption that the repatriated funds havebeen fully reinvested in the German MFI sec-tor in a manner affecting the money stock,repatriated Euro-market deposits wouldtherefore account for around 2
12percentage
points of the percentage rise in the Germancontribution to M3 in 1999.
8
Since slightly less than half of the returningfunds came from Luxembourg, the repatri-ation of private German non-banks’ Euro-market deposits triggered a sharp decline inLuxembourg’s contribution to M3.
9At the
euro-area level, monetary growth thereforedid not fully reflect the repatriation of funds

countries estimated on the basis of country-specific
money demand functions is provided in: Dedola, L., E.
Gaiotti and L. Silipo (2001), op. cit.
7The term “special developments” is used to mean
monetary developments which cannot be explained
using traditional explanatory factors of the demand for
money, i.e. interest-rate and income developments. Ra-
ther, their cause is to be found in particular in changes in
the institutional framework within which money holders
take their portfolio decisions (examples include changes
in taxation and minimum reserve requirements as well as
the emergence of financial innovations).
8The distortion given here rests on the assumption that
Euro-market deposits would have stagnated in lieu of the
massive repatriations, as was generally the case between
1994 and 1998, given certain fluctuations.

48from Luxembourg. By contrast, the repatri-
ation of Euro-market funds from non-euro-area financial centres (particularly London)led to the twelve-month rate of euro-areaM3 being overstated in December 1999 byaround one-half percentage point.
In 2000, the development of short-term de-
posits held by German non-banks at foreignbranches and subsidiaries reversed itself, onbalance. Whereas the reduction in depositsplaced in London continued over the courseof 2000, short-term deposits in Luxembourgwere perceptibly increased, nearly reachingtheir pre-monetary union level by the end of2000. However, this was partly due to shiftsof deposits from London to Luxembourg.
The introduction of uniform minimum reserve
rules in the euro area will probably have a per-ceptible impact on the development of othereuro-area countries’ national contributionsto M3, too. Besides Luxembourg, whereminimum-reserve-exempted longer-term bankdeposits and investment forms outside the MFIsector initially benefited from the new min-imum reserve requirement on short-term bankliabilities,

enced a decline in shorter-term funds heldwith banks.

49imum reserve. However, the decline in bank
deposits in Italy had an even more significantimpact. In July 1996 the tax rate for interest in-come from bank deposits was set at a uniformlevel of 27%, placing certificates of deposit( C D )w i t ham a t u r i t yo fo v e r1 8m o n t h s–which had previously been taxed at a rate of12.5% – at a disadvantage. This move causeda protracted reduction in short-term CDs,which are classified as time deposits with anagreed maturity of up to two years, and inlonger-term CDs, which are classified as timedeposits with an agreed maturity of over twoyears.
12Apart from the change in tax on inter-
est income, a seismic shift in investment behav-iour has taken place in Italy in the past fewyears, apparently due also to the lasting im-provement in the outlook for stability. Longer-term bank debt securities, sales of domesticand foreign investment fund certificates, andlow-interest-bearing, highly liquid overnightmoney all benefited.
The aforementioned extensive purchase of
money market fund certificates by non-euro-area residents benefited Irish money marketfunds, in particular. Available reliable datashow that the lion’s share of Irish money mar-ket fund shares/units in circulation is beingheld by non-euro-area residents, whereas theshare of paper held by euro-area residents isinsignificant and, in addition, is largely stag-nant. Non-euro-area residents’ demand is ap-parently also a major factor in Luxembourg’smoney market funds. Though that market isnot as large or as dynamic as that of Ireland,Luxembourg’s contribution to M3 is likely tobe distorted as well.Given all the difficulties involved in ascertain-
ing the structure of holders of paper tradedon secondary markets, the overstatement ofM3 growth due to non-euro-area residents’holdings of money market paper may be justas great as that of holdings of money marketfund shares/units.
13At issue here is, in par-
ticular, money market paper issued by Ger-man MFIs. Several elements have contributedto the great demand for German money mar-ket paper: a general catching-up process ofthe securitised German money market, whichhad been hitherto underdeveloped; the intro-duction of interest on minimum reserve hold-ings at the beginning of 1999; and also ef-forts by foreign investors to find a liquid, safeinvestment vehicle in the run-up to Y2K.Though net sales of money market paper out-side the German MFI sector were down some80% in 2000 from the previous year, demandon the part of non-euro-area residents forsuch paper remained high – whereas in thefirst year of monetary union issues were de-nominated almost exclusively in euro, in theyear 2000 German MFIs, on balance, soldpaper denominated solely in foreign curren-cies. The lion’s share of such paper is appar-ently being held by non-euro-area residents.All in all, therefore, the distortion of thegrowth rate of M3 in connection with pur-chases of German money market paper by

The significance of heterogeneity for
European monetary policy
On the whole, monetary structures in the indi-
vidual euro-area countries continue to bequite heterogeneous. Though the compon-ents of M3 have gradually converged, due pri-marily to the sharp decline in savings depositsin Germany, the differences between thecounterparts have become even greater, espe-cially regarding external assets and externalliabilities. Monetary growth, too, has varied,sometimes considerably. National contribu-tions’ rates of growth converged until spring2000, after which the gap re-opened (seechart on page 51). That is also the case forthe four largest euro-area countries (Germany,France, Italy and Spain), which together makeup more than 70% of euro-area M3.
This heterogeneity hampers the interpretation
of monetary developments in the euro area.Not only national special factors, which areoften difficult to recognise and quantify, butalso “traditional” influencing factors, whichhave varying impacts on the money stock inthe individual countries, play a role. If, for in-stance, national M3 contributions react differ-ently to GDP movements in their countries, andif at the same time economic growth variesamong the euro-area countries, euro-area M3can change independently of euro-area GDP .By the same token, euro-area M3 can remainconstant even though aggregate GDP in theeuro area has gone either up or down. In prin-ciple, the same applies to the influence of inter-est rates. However, as far as interest rates go,
differences among the euro-area countries inthe long-term segment have gone down mark-edly as a result of the process of interest-rateconvergence. Short-term interest rates, owingto their proximity to central bank lending ratesand to the single money market, are nearlyidentical in all euro-area countries anyway.
Where pronounced differences in economic
situations and in the money demand functionexist between the individual countries, know-ledge regarding the development of nationalcontributions may also provide valuable infor-mation to a monetary policy committed tomaintaining price stability throughout theeuro area. Dedola, Gaiotti and Silipo use asimple two-country model to demonstratethat the single optimal interest rate is de-pendent on the level of individual nationalcontributions and the parameters of the twonational money demand functions in thosecases when national output elasticities andthe variance of real and monetary disturb-ances deviate from one another.
14
Despite the heterogeneity in monetary devel-opments among the individual euro-areacountries described above, euro-area M3 isundoubtedly the key monetary variable onwhich the single monetary policy is oriented.Here, the European money demand functioneven benefits from diverging developments,owing to which it demonstrates greaterstability than the individual national moneydemand functions of the euro-area coun-

51tries.15For one thing, this is probably attribut-
able to intra-euro-area transactions, which arenot reflected in the euro-area aggregate butwhich certainly have an impact on the develop-ment of national contributions, such as theGerman and Luxembourg contributions. Foranother things, the area-wide impact ofchanges in the individual countries’ financialsectors is not as great if these changes go handin hand with stable money demand functionsin other euro-area countries. Finally, even thewholly random fluctuations in European moneydemand may be less forceful than those at thenational level. Although this “statistical aver-aging effect”
16is particularly evident in those
cases where the countries hit by monetaryshocks are alike in terms of size (of their econ-omies), this effect is largely responsible for thegreater stability of European money demand.
Empirical area-wide findings
The stability of money demand is important
for using M3 as an information variable forfuture price developments. In estimating anarea-wide demand for money, in most casesthe real demand for money (m-p) is analysedin the long run as a function of a scale vari-able (y) – both in logarithms – and one or sev-eral opportunity cost variables (r).
m – p = f(y, r)However, the exact shape of the specification
is still the subject of dispute in the literature.This primarily concerns the question of ad-equately choosing and measuring the vari-able(s) of opportunity cost. Besides an incomevariable – a wealth variable is rarely used as a
scale variable
17– various combinations of
long-term and short-term interest rates areused, as well as, on some occasions, thespread and the inflation rate.

52high percentage of interest-bearing compon-
ents in M3, the own rate of return on M3 haslatterly been more carefully formulated andtaken into account.
19
Using the simple difference between thelong-term interest rate and the money mar-ket rate (the latter being an approximation ofthe own rate of return, such as in Coenenand Vega’s study) implies a short-run parallel-ism of M3 and interest, since the raising ofshort-term interest rates coincides with a flat-tening of the yield curve. Thus, the short-term development of the money stock is diffi-cult to interpret.
Dedola, Gaiotti and Silipo, as well as Calza,
Gerdesmeier and Levy, each use the differ-ence between long/short-term interest ratesand a (calculated) own rate of return. The
first group of researchers use a single-equation approach, whereas the latter beginby using a system containing the differencebetween the long-term interest rate and theown rate of return and between the short-term interest rate and the own rate of return.By testing diverse restrictions, they derive along-run money demand equation in whichonly the difference between the short-terminterest rate and the own rate of returnenters as a measure of the opportunity costsof holding money. The influence of the differ-ence between the long-term interest rate andthe own rate of return proves to be non-significant. It turns out that, by incorporatingthe own rate of return, the coefficient of theshort-term interest rate changes its sign.
The Bundesbank’s own estimates (see notes
on page 54) using a model with the realmoney stock, real GDP , the long-term interestrate, the short-term interest rate, the own rateof return and the inflation rate as variables,have resulted in an income elasticity of 1.3,which is significantly higher than unity. Thus,the velocity of circulation is displaying a declin-ing trend. Economic theory is rather vague

Money Demand: Measuring the Opportunity Costs Ap-
propriately”, 2001, mimeo. Differences also exist relating
to the question of whether inflation should be included
in the long-run demand for money. The fact that inflation
may be a measure of the return on holding goods argues
in favour of inclusion. However, the expected future rate
of inflation is more likely to be relevant to holding money,
and according to the Fisher hypothesis it is contained in
the long-term interest rate. Moreover, it has been shown
that the cointegrativeness of the money demand rela-
tionship is not lost if the inflation rate is not included (this
result was reached by Golinelli, R. and S. Pastorello,

53concerning the magnitude of this parameter.
A value greater than unity indicates thatmoney acts not only as a medium of paymentbut also as a store of value. For the broadly de-fined monetary aggregate M3, which alsocontains components bearing interest in linewith market rates, the estimated value doesnot seem implausible. The semi-elasticity ofthe difference between the long-term interestrate and the short-term interest rate is –1.76.That means that if this interest gap widens,money holdings are distinctly curtailed – and,conversely, these holdings grow if the gapnarrows. The income elasticity correspondsroughly to that of the Brand/Cassola model(for the observation period being looked athere), which, except for the own rate of re-turn, contains the same variables, whereas thesemi-interest elasticity is higher if the own rateof return is taken into account (–1.76 versus–0.77). That is a sign that the difference be-tween the long-term interest rate and theown rate of return is a better indicator of theopportunity costs of holding money than thelong-term interest rate by itself.
All in all, real money demand for the area-
wide broad money stock M3 has proved tobe stable at the euro-area level over the longrun. Therefore, M3 growth is in a sufficientlyclose medium to long-term relationship toreal GDP growth and to the opportunity costsof holding money, which is measured interms of the difference between the yield onten-year government bonds outstanding andthe weighted own rate of return on M3 com-ponents. Price developments in the euro areaare determined to a high degree over thelong run by the rise in nominal M3. The mon-etary policy of the Eurosystem, geared to
price stability, is therefore justified in attach-ing key importance to M3.
Over the short run, however, M3 is prone to
random fluctuations which can impair its in-formative value. However, the error correc-tion term of the long-run demand for moneymakes a significantly negative contribution toexplaining the short-run demand for money;therefore, wherever disruptions occur, moneyholding is adjusted until a new equilibrium iscreated.
Otherwise, M3 is sufficiently controllable. In-
creasing short-term rates, in addition to caus-ing an increase in long-term rates, also causethe own rate of return on M3 to rise. How-ever, since the increase in the own rate of re-turn is disproportionately low due to the pres-ence of non-interest-bearing components,the opportunity cost of holding money in-creases, on balance, during the phase ofinterest-rate increases.
The price gap, or – as the ECB calls it, the real
money gap – can be calculated on the basisof the estimated money demand equation.This gap shows the future inflation pressurebeing exerted by the current (real) balances.Both concepts show the percentage deviationof the real money stock from its long-termequilibrium value.

money stock exceeds its equilibrium value,

The definition of money used here is M3. The
index series published by the ECB is used herein order to rule out the possibility of statisticaldistortion; it is not adjusted for money marketfund shares/units held by non-euro-area resi-dents. Real gross domestic product is used asthe scale variable; the GDP deflator is used tomeasure the price index. Both variables areseasonally adjusted. They are based on dataprovided by Brand and Cassola and based onECB revisions. The yield on ten-year govern-ment bonds outstanding is used as the long-term rate, and three-month money marketinterest rates are used as the short-termrate. The own rate of return corresponds toa weighted interest rate in which the na-tional interest rates of the components areweighted using their share in the M3 aggre-gate. A distinction is made between threetypes of components: currency, bank depositsand negotiable instruments. For negotiableinstruments, the three-month money marketrate is assumed to be the interest rate. Thedata used are quarterly data between the firstquarter of 1983 and the fourth quarter of2000.
In the following text, we will look at a system
consisting of the real money stock (m-p), realGDP (y), the real long-term interest rate (rl),the short-term interest rate (rk), the own rateof return on M3 (rm3) and the inflation rate.Since some series show patterns akin totrends, an unrestricted constant, i.e. a driftterm, is assumed in the VEC model. The Jo-hansen procedure analyses the question as towhether stationary long-run relationships ex-ist, since the individual time series each con-tain a unit root. The lag order p is definedsuch that the residuals are not autocorre-lated, which, in this case, means p = 2. Thenumber of cointegration relationships r is de-termined using the Trace test. This test pointsto four stationary long-run relationshipsgiven a 5% margin of error (see table).By means of tests using various parameter
restrictions, a money demand equation, termstructure equation, Fisher equation and anequation for the correlation between theshort-term interest rate and the own rateof return are identified. The correspondingresidual restrictions cannot be rejected(LR-test = 6.71, p-value = 0.15).
The resultant long-run money demand func-
tion is
(m–p)
t= 1.30 y t– 1.76 ( rl – rm3 )t
In the short-run equation for the develop-
ment of the money stock, the adjustmentcoefficient of the error correction term ofmoney demand is – 0.09, and the correspond-ing t-value is – 4.25. The test for weak exo-geneity implies that the remaining variablesare weakly exogenous to the parameters ofmoney demand (LR-test = 9.73; p-value =0.37).
The money stock is controllable through
short-run dynamics and long-run equilibriumrelationships between the long-term andshort-term interest rates (coefficient: 1.00)and between the short-term interest rate andthe own rate of return (coefficient: 0.62). TheHansen and Johansen recursive test indicatesstability of the estimated long-term equili-brium relationships.

55the greater future price increases will be. The
equilibrium money stock is derived on thebasis of the money demand function, intowhich potential output (as equilibrium GDP)and an equilibrium interest differential are in-serted. The underlying potential output is de-
rived from the GDP values used here with thehelp of a Hodrick-Prescott filter. The prevail-ing interest-rate situation has been assumedto be in equilibrium for simplicity.
According to these calculations, a price gap
formed, especially in 1999. Monetary growthoutpaced its path of equilibrium. Afterwards,the price gap largely closed; monetarygrowth decelerated, and part of the preced-ing sharp growth in the money stock waseaten up by stronger-than-expected price in-creases. Inflationary pressure owing to exces-sively large money holdings no longer exists.Given all the methodological differenceswhich must be observed when comparing in-dividual empirical studies, the results of ECBanalyses are borne out here, too.

57Trends in Länder
Governmentfinance sincethe mid-ninetiesThe financial position of the Länder im-
proved considerably between the mid-nineties and last year. By the year 2000the deficits, which had reached an all-time high of DM 46
12billion in 1996,
had declined to DM 19 billion. This wasmainly due to the recovery in tax rev-enue since 1998 as well as to the limita-tion on the growth in expenditure. Theeast German Länder have also beensuccessful in reducing deficits. Owingto their persistently low tax potential,however, they continue to be depend-ent on large-scale transfers. Since thebeginning of the current year the over-all financial position of the Länder hasagain deteriorated significantly. This isessentially due to the large revenueshortfalls as a result of the tax reform.The sharply growing deficits highlightthe need for continued retrenchment,especially as most of the Länder areendeavouring to achieve balancedbudgets. This would be consistent withthe objectives of the European Stabilityand Growth Pact, which requires gen-eral government to achieve a balancedbudget in the medium term. The taxpotential of the individual Länder var-ies considerably. This differential islargely levelled out, and in some casesthe respective positions of the Länderwere even reversed by the revenue-sharing scheme and supplementaryFederal grants. This system has now tobe revised following a ruling of theFederal Constitutional Court in Novem-ber 1999.

58Overall trends in Länder
Government finance
The Länder budgets ran large deficits in the
middle of the nineties. An all-time high ofDM 46
12billion was reached in 1996 when
almost 10% of total expenditure had to becovered by borrowing and reductions in re-serves.
1To prevent the level of debt and the
resultant interest burden from getting out ofhand significant and rapid reductions in thefinancial gap were urgently necessary. By theyear 2000 it had been possible to reduce thedeficits by more than one-half to DM 19 bil-lion, or 4% of expenditure.
Länder in both eastern and western Germany
have been successful in reducing their def-icits. Owing to their less favourable startingpoint, however, the east German Länder (ex-
cluding Berlin) still cannot finance a muchlarger share of their expenditure, at just over7%, through “normal” receipts. Indeed, thedifferences between the individual Länder areeven greater. Whereas preliminary data showthat Bavaria, for example, was able to achievea budget surplus in the year 2000, the deficitsin Berlin, Hamburg, Mecklenburg-WesternPomerania, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia stillamounted to much more than 6% of theirrespective levels of expenditure.
One major reason for the advance made in
consolidation was the limitation placed onthe growth in expenditure. At the beginningof the nineties Länder expenditure had stillbeen rising at an average annual rate of morethan 5%. As a result of the sharp deceler-ation in the increase in revenue, the Länderwere compelled to make a dramatic cut inthe growth of their expenditure. Between1997 and 2000 the average increase was justa little more than
12%. Thus, the recommen-
dation from the Financial Planning Council tolimit the annual growth in expenditure to amaximum of 2% was also achieved.
With a share of almost 40%, total expend-
iture on staff is the most important categoryof expenditure in the Länder budgets. Withthe exception of 1995 and 1999 (when an in-crease in the rate of contributions to the sup-plementary pension funds for salary andwage earners had also to be covered) the ne-gotiated wage settlements and the resultantDM

59pay increases for civil servants remained mod-
erate. This is especially true in the light of civilservants’ compulsory working hours, which insome cases were extended. However, thelimitation of the average annual increase inexpenditure on current staff since 1995 to
12% could be achieved only by reducing staff
numbers by 112% a year.2All major areas of
activity were affected by this, albeit to varyingdegrees. Particularly in the past two years,however, there has again been an expansionin recruitment in the schools and to some ex-tent in the police in many Länder. The reduc-tion in staff has been slowed down as a result.
Expenditure on pensioners has been growing
at an annual average rate of just over 4%since 1995 owing to the sharply rising num-ber of pensioners. In 2000 they accounted foras much as one-fifth of total expenditure onstaff, which, despite the savings made in thecase of current employees, has thereby risenat an average annual rate of 1
14%. As a re-
sult of the sharp increase in the number ofpensioners, a significant long-term burden onLänder budgets is emerging. Although a re-serve fund was founded in 1999 to financethis via contributions amounting to 0.2 per-centage point of every increase in civil ser-vants’ pay and pensions until 2013, thismeasure can take account of only part of theextra burden.
The increase in grants to other public author-
ities, which account for just over one-fifth ofLänder expenditure, has been checked evenmore than the increase in expenditure onstaff. More than 90% of these payments goto the municipalities. To a large extent theyare covered by the tax-sharing arrangements
which the Länder have made with their muni-cipalities, especially with respect to importantshared taxes. As the shares in tax revenue canonly be changed by legislation, the develop-ment of these grants depends on the respect-ive trends in tax revenue, as a rule. Cuts havebeen made principally in the case of pay-ments which – like the investment grants –are not subject to fixed rules of that kind. Al-though the Länder have been paying add-itional compensation to their municipalitiesfor their loss of tax revenue (about DM 4 bil-lion in the year 2000) since the change in thesystem of child benefit payments – since1996 these payments have been offsetPercentage change from previous year

60against wage tax – and although tax revenue
has been rising more sharply again since1998, total payments to other public author-ities were only 1
12% larger last year than in
1995.
Although grants by the Länder Governments
to the private sector have grown at an annualaverage of 2
12% since 1995, this has hardly
had a detrimental effect on Länder budgetson balance. The reason is that most of thisrise is due to the transfer of responsibility forlocal passenger transport from the FederalGovernment to the Länder Governments aspart of the 1996 reform of German railways.In compensation for this transfer of responsi-bility the Länder Governments receive a shareof the Federal Government’s revenue frommineral oil tax. This, together with additional– partly investible – funds for local public pas-senger transport, amounted to just overDM 13 billion in 2000. As there was almostno change to legislation on benefits, therewas virtually no rise in current transfers tohouseholds, notably housing allowances,benefits paid under the Federal Act on thePromotion of Education and child mainten-ance advances, which are all co-financed bythe Federal Government.
Investment expenditure (excluding invest-
ment grants to the municipalities) was actual-ly reduced by 11
12% between 1996 and
1999. There was only a slight rise in this ex-penditure again last year. Consequently, itsshare of total expenditure declined by 1
12per-
centage points to just over 10% comparedwith 1995. Although building expenditurereached the 1995 level, at DM 11
12billion, in-vestment grants, notably to hospitals, educa-
tional establishments, house building com-panies and local rail transport, declined con-siderably (by DM 3 billion to DM 26 billion).There was likewise a decline in land acquisi-tion. To a lesser extent, however, this was dueto the removal of some building operationsfrom the Land budgets.
The Land budgets were burdened by the rise
in interest expenditure up to 1999. The aver-age amount of interest paid on loans hasbeen reduced by the low interest rate levelduring the past few years (just over 6
12%i n
1995 falling to just over 534% last year).
However, the persistently sharp rise in debthas been undermining this effect with theresult that interest expenditure increased byalmost 4
12% a year until 1999.
Until 1997 the retrenchment on expenditure
was almost offset by the fact that the tax rev-enue of the Länder stagnated for the mostpart. Following the changeover in the systemof paying the (increased) child benefit to off-setting it against wage tax and the substantialrise in the basic allowance following a deci-sion by the Federal Constitutional Court, therevenue of the Länder from wage tax actuallyfell considerably in 1996. As compensationfor the loss of tax revenue resulting from thechange in child benefit payments, however,the Federal Government granted the Ländera5
12percentage point increase in their share
of turnover tax. However, the local authoritiesalso have to be compensated from this. In1997 the persistently strong decline in as-sessed income tax played a role, not least as aresult of the special depreciation allowancesGrowth in

61granted in eastern Germany. Furthermore,
the abolition of wealth tax – following a deci-sion by the Federal Constitutional Court –represented an additional burden (of almostDM 7
12billion) for the Länder. Some of the
increases in the tax on the acquisition of landand buildings and in the inheritance tax thatwere conceived as compensation neededtime to take effect and, initially, could there-fore compensate for little more than one-third of the lost revenue in 1997.
Tax revenue again increased strongly from
1998. On an average of the last three years itrose by almost 4
12%. However, growth
weakened again last year as a result of the cutin income taxation and a marked decline inrevenue from the tax on the acquisition ofland and buildings owing to the slowdown inthe construction industry. The generally morefavourable tendency in the last three yearswas due in the first instance to the gradual ex-piry of the special depreciation allowances forinvestment in eastern Germany and the im-provement in corporate profits. Secondly, theLänder also obtained substantially larger re-ceipts from turnover tax in the last two years.To a lesser extent, however, these were due in2000 to the 25 basis point increase in the Län-der share of this levy that was granted as com-pensation for the further rise in child benefit.It was not least as a result of their increasingparticipation in turnover tax that the Länderincreased their share of total tax revenuesomewhat compared with the mid-nineties(from 36.5% in 1995 to 37.4% in 2000
3).
In view of the sluggish flow of tax revenue in
the mid-nineties, some Länder tried to closegaps in their budgets by selling participating
interests. These sales reached a peak at almostDM 10
12billion in 1997, with Berlin and Ham-
burg alone receiving almost DM 6 billion andjust under DM 2 billion, respectively. By theyear 2000 the income from these sales haddeclined to just under DM 5
12billion. This in-Percentage change from previous year

to the city state of Berlin, which has experi-enced serious budgetary problems since thereduction in its extensive financial assistancefrom the Federal Government following reuni-fication. The Länder still hold extensive partici-pating interests. If a well-designed marketeconomy is taken as a criterion, further salesare advisable. However, the proceeds shouldnot be used to finance additional expenditurebut, instead, to reduce the debt burden.
Budgetary position of Länder
in eastern Germany
The Länder in eastern Germany
4have been
fully integrated into the framework governingtax distribution and revenue sharing since1995. The resultant annual receipts substan-tially exceeded the payments made from the“German Unity” Fund, which were discon-tinued at the end of 1994. Although part ofthe additional receipts was passed on to theeast German local authorities, it was possibleto reduce the deficit by DM 4
12billion to
DM 12 billion in 1995. Despite the progressmade in reducing the deficit in the followingfew years, the shortfall in cover, at almostDM 550 per inhabitant, was still about threetimes as high as in western Germany in theyear 2000. Even so, there are marked differ-ences from one Land to another in the east ofthe country, too. For example, Saxony is actu-ally still far below the west German average.
Total expenditure per inhabitant has ex-
ceeded the level in western Germany by one-third since the mid-nineties. However, thisratio is distorted by the substantial grants
which are made – to a large extent financedby the Federal Government – to the east Ger-man municipalities, which generate little taxrevenue.
5If payments to other public author-
ities are excluded, per capita expenditure ineastern Germany was recently just under10% more than in western Germany.

Per capita expenditure on staff recentlyamounted to just over four-fifths of the levelin western Germany. This was principally dueas a percentage of the west German average

5Per capita grants to the municipalities were recently
more than twice as large as in the west.
6It must always be remembered in the case of the rev-
enue and expenditure levels of the core budgets that
they may be distorted by the shifting of tasks to the local
authorities (which, in the case of the city states, are fully
attributed to the Länder Governments) or to the corpor-
ate sector, which differs from Land to Land.Larger deficits

64to the still very low payments to retired civil
servants.7It is true that the Länder in eastern
Germany also enjoy relief from the fact thatpay rates are still lower than in the west(about 13% lower on an annual average inthe year 2000). Even so, per capita expend-iture on employed persons (i.e. excludingpayments to pensioners) has risen moresharply than in the west since the mid-nineties and recently actually exceeded thewestern level by 6%. The sharper rises in in-come could not be offset by the reduction instaff, which, at an annual average of justunder 2
12%, was almost twice as fast as in
western Germany. The number of personsemployed by the Länder Governments per in-habitant is still one-seventh above the com-parable figure for western Germany
8and will
probably be a place for further retrenchment.Although investment expenditure per inhabit-
ant (excluding the investment grants to themunicipalities) was somewhat lower in 2000than in 1995, it was still two and a half timesas high as in western Germany. A large propor-tion of the payments is used for investmentgrants. Considerable importance is attached tosupporting business investment considered asregional aid. Investment grants for hospitalsand housing are also important although thespecial needs of these areas will probably be-come gradually less acute considering the levelof provision that has now been reached. How-ever, gaps in infrastructure, especially trans-port, are still having a detrimental effect on theeconomic development of eastern Germany.
The interest burden per inhabitant is now just
over 90% of the level in western Germanycompared with just under 60% in 1995. Thisincrease is due to the generally greaterweight of borrowing in the east German Län-der, which in 1991 had virtually no debt. In2000, per capita debt in the east had reachedalmost the same level as in the west.
At DM 7,000, receipts per inhabitant likewise
exceeded the comparable level in the west re-cently – by just over one-quarter, in fact. Thiswas due to extensive transfers from the Fed-as a percentage of the west German average

7However, the Länder in eastern Germany must make
payments to the Federal Government for pensioners
covered by the special and supplementary pension sys-
tems in the former East Germany. If these payments are
added to the actual pensions paid, per capita expenditure
in 1999 amounted to just over 45% of the western level
instead of the 5% shown in the financial statistics.
8East Berlin is regarded as part of eastern Germany in
the statistics on staff. As the ratio of part-time employees
in the Länder Governments in eastern Germany is about
10 percentage points lower than in the west, the differ-
ence in staff numbers is actually understated in this com-
parison.Lower total

65eral Government, which, together with the
payments from the west German Länder, ac-count for almost 45% of receipts and havebeen initially fixed only until the end of 2004.
In 2000, tax revenue per inhabitant amount-
ed to almost DM 3,600, or 84% of the west-ern level. However, the figure greatly over-states the tax potential inherent in the region-al economy because that figure comprisesboth the general allocation of turnover taxbased on the number of inhabitants and theadvance equalising transfers made with re-spect to this particular tax. Last year bothcomponents, taken together, resulted in re-ceipts of DM 2,750 per inhabitant. If the tax-raising potential is measured in terms of in-come taxes and corporate tax alone,
9the
ratio is decidedly less favourable. Given percapita revenue of just over DM 650, onlyone-quarter of the level in the west GermanLänder was achieved in 2000. The corres-ponding figure in 1995 was just over 30%.This means that the region’s own tax-raisingpower has not improved in the past fewyears, not least because of the unfavourableemployment trend. The east German Länderwill therefore continue to be dependent onsubstantial transfers even after 2004.
The Länder’s revenue-sharing scheme
The German system of public finance does
not provide the Länder Governments withthe possibility of adjusting their taxes tomatch their respective financial needs. At thesame time, the Basic Law mentions uniformliving standards as a fundamental criterion.Given these underlying conditions, it may be
necessary to give financial assistance to“poor” Länder so that they can provide theirresidents with public services of a similarstandard to those afforded by the “rich” Län-der. This regional redistribution of funds isachieved in Germany by means of a multi-tierrevenue-sharing scheme.
The revenue-sharing scheme in its broader
sense, which has been practised in its presentform since 1995, adjusts the respective finan-cial resources of the Länder in three steps.The first step comprises the advance equalisa-tion in turnover tax distribution, which had atransfer volume of DM 17 billion in 2000.This is used to bring the tax revenue of Länderwhich fail to raise at least 92% of averagetax receipts (excluding turnover tax and localauthority taxes) per inhabitant up to thislevel. Up to one-quarter of the Länder’s totalshare of turnover tax is reserved for thisequalisation arrangement before the residualamount is distributed among the individualLänder according to the respective number ofresidents – a process which also encompassesa redistribution from the place where the re-ceipts were generated.
10In the subsequent
9The local revenue from wage tax before the deduction
of child benefit has been taken as a base. Refunds have
been included in the case of assessed income tax, non-
assessed taxes on earnings and corporation tax. The re-
distribution of tax revenue from its place of origin to the
recipient authorities according to tax distribution rules (a
process called Steuerzerlegung ) has been taken into ac-
count in the case of interest income and corporation tax.
10There is also a redistribution of local revenue as part
of the breakdown of taxes (Steuerzerlegung) . Whereas
the redistribution of wage tax is based on the domicile of
the tax payer and, to that extent, may differ from the
place where the income concerned was generated, the
redistribution of corporation tax and trade tax is based
on the location of the operating plant and thus on the
original economic potential.Regional tax

66step of the revenue-sharing scheme in the
narrower sense tax revenue (including turn-over tax and one-half of the local authoritytaxes adjusted mainly by the multiplier differ-ential to take account of differences in thetax rates) that falls below the averageamount is topped up to 95% of the average,which is the compensation coefficient. (Thevolume in 2000 was just over DM 16 billion.)In the process revenue arising from miningroyalties is added to the tax receipts and alump sum to cover the cost of seaports is de-ducted. Furthermore, a concession is grantedto the city states in that their financial needsper citizen is considered to be 35% higherthan elsewhere. The equalisation tariff pro-vides for an increase in the marginal absorp-tion rates for Länder of above-average tax po-tential to 80% as soon as the compensatorycoefficient is exceeded by 10%. Finally, in a
third step, there is a vertical revenue-sharingarrangement. Here, the Federal Governmentpays the “financially weak” Länder shortfall-related supplementary Federal grants withthe result that the revenue of these Länder israised to 99.5% of the compensatory coeffi-cient, i.e. to almost the Länder average. Inaddition, there are Federal grants to cover avariety of special needs (special-requirement-related supplementary Federal grants), as aresult of which the position of the Länderwith respect to their financial capacity mayactually be reversed (total volume in the thirdstage just over DM 26 billion in 2000).

67stitutional Court because it does not define
with sufficient precision the legal terms whichhave not been specified in the Basic Law.Only if legislation on standards, which closesthese gaps, is passed by the end of 2002 canthe present regulations continue to applyuntil the end of 2004. A new Tax EqualisationAct will then have to be submitted by the endof 2004. However, a reorganisation of thecontents of the revenue-sharing scheme hasnot been explicitly demanded.
The most important shortcoming of the
present equalisation mechanism is the almostcomplete levelling of differences in tax yields.This undermines the incentives for both thedonor Länder and the beneficiary Länder toincrease their economic and tax-yielding po-tential through their own efforts and to ex-ploit all the sources of tax available to them.Any reform of the revenue-sharing scheme,which would have to aim under Federal effi-ciency aspects at increasing the individualpublic authorities’ own level of responsibility,should therefore focus on substantially redu-cing the equalisation tariff and dispensingwith minimum replenishment levels of anysort. The draft legislation submitted by theFederal Government is directed along theselines. However, the flexibility of the Länderbudgets on the expenditure side is relativelylimited in the short term with the result thatchanges in the transfer volume would have tobe extended over a longer period of time.
A particularly controversial point is the degree
to which local authority tax revenue shouldbe taken into account. As the Länder Govern-ments have to provide a reasonable level offunding for their local authorities through the
local authority revenue-sharing scheme, it ap-pears to be justifiable, in principle, to includelocal authority tax revenue to a greater extentin the Länder revenue-sharing scheme. Ad-mittedly, this would increase the intensity ofthe equalisation scheme even more. If themarginal absorption rates remained high,there would be a growing risk that, in netterms, additional income from, say, wage taxwould actually have a detrimental effect onthe Länder budgets unless this were offset bymaking changes to the local authority rev-enue-sharing scheme. To reduce the presentundesirable incentives it would be all themore important in the event of a greateramount of local authority tax revenue beingincluded to lower the marginal burden dis-cernibly by means of the equalisation tariff.
The greater needs of the city states over the
other states (Flächenländer) – which are far
larger in terms of area (Fläche) – are justified
by the fact that the city states provide majorcentrally located amenities which are enjoyedby people living in the surrounding towns andvillages but, as a result of the distribution ofwage tax according to the taxpayer’s place ofresidence, a considerable portion of the citystates’ tax revenue is lost to these surround-ing communities. A higher populationweighting is one possible way of compensat-ing for these effects.
11However, the size of
this weighting element is controversial; at allevents, following the ruling of the FederalConstitutional Court, the present population
11A more appropriate alternative might be to base the
distribution of wage tax not only on domicile but also on
the location of the taxpayer’s place of work.Possible points

69weighting has to be reviewed. This also ap-
plies to other possible structural additionalneeds such as those in particularly sparselypopulated regions. In principle, a very restrict-ive yardstick ought to be used here becausethe acknowledgement of a greater need caneasily result in other claims being made ofspecial circumstances that require compensa-tion. There would then be the risk that therevenue-sharing scheme would become in-creasingly arbitrary and less transparent.
The Federal Constitutional Court has de-
manded a substantial reduction in the redis-tribution volume relating to supplementaryFederal grants. Despite the secondary func-tion of these payments, the redistribution vol-ume far exceeds the volume of the revenue-sharing scheme in the narrower sense. Thisdisproportion can be justified by the burdensresulting from reunification only for a limitedperiod. In principle, a substantial reduction inthe shortfall-related supplementary Federalgrants seems necessary. Moreover, it is onlywhere individual Länder are carrying seriousspecial burdens which have to be proved indetail that an increase in their financesthrough special-requirement-related supple-mentary grants can be justified. The excep-tional character of these grants should beemphasised by setting especially strict condi-tions, a limitation on the length of time overwhich they are paid and a gradual reductionin their volume over that period. The draft le-gislation submitted by the Federal Govern-ment goes along these lines. The present sys-tem of transfers to offset the higher cost perinhabitant of political management in thesmaller Länder is one of the special forms ofFederal grant which appears to be problemat-
ical. It is difficult to explain the fact that morethan one-half of the Länder benefit fromthese grants and that the sum paid actuallyincreases in line with the size of the Land con-cerned. The aid for amortisation of excessivedebt which the Federal Government grants toBremen and the Saarland following a rulingby the Federal Constitutional Court in 1992that these two Länder were facing a budget-ary emergency is also worth investigatingfrom an incentive point of view. At least,these payments taper off over time and – likethe transitional grants to some financiallyweak west German Länder – expire at theend of 2004.
The experience gained over the past few dec-
ades has shown that the dominance of thetax-sharing arrangements and the consider-able importance of mixed forms of fundinghave blurred the responsibilities of the variouspublic authorities. For that reason it would beadvisable to aim for the reinstatement of amore clear-cut distribution of responsibilities,allocating them to the lowest possible level ofgovernment along the lines of the subsidiarityprinciple. It also seems sensible to grant theLänder a limited degree of tax autonomy, forexample, the right to raise a supplementarylevy on joint taxes or the legislative power forthe Länder taxes. Generally speaking, the aimshould be to boost the individual public au-thorities’ own level of responsibility to suchan extent that the public again have a clearerconception of the relationship between gov-ernment functions and the tax burden. Thiswould promote a more economical use ofpublic funds.

70The financial position of the
individual Länder
There are considerable differences in the cur-
rent financial position of the Länder despitethe great extent to which their tax revenueshave been brought into line. If their positionin the revenue-sharing scheme is taken as ayardstick, the donor Länder of Hesse, Ham-burg, Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria andNorth Rhine-Westphalia have to be classifiedas financially strong, at least before the ef-fects of the equalisation scheme. By contrast,the other 11 Länder received payments and,consequently, would have to be regarded asfinancially weak. However, the position of aLand in the revenue-sharing scheme, which isbased on tax-raising potential, still does notprovide sufficient information on the relativelevel of deficits, total receipts and expend-iture.
For example, the beneficiary Land of Saxony
recently had deficits per inhabitant whichwere more or less as low as those of thedonor Länder of Baden-Württemberg andHesse. The Länder with above-average def-icits include some which have to make pay-ments into the revenue-sharing scheme (seealso the table of page 68). The total receiptsof Länder entitled to equalisation paymentsare not always below the level of the donorLänder. This situation is partly due to the in-come which arises from the sales of assetsand from fees and charges, as these receiptsare not included in the revenue-sharingscheme. Even more important are the supple-mentary Federal grants, which create an ad-vantage for some Länder, especially in easternGermany. The main reason for the special
position of the city states is that in the rev-enue-sharing scheme a special weighting fac-tor is applied to the number of their citizens.If in the case of the other states (Flächenlän-
der)the receipts of the local authorities are
taken into consideration, the city states stillhave a total of one-third more income thanthese Flächenländer.
In the case of total per capita expenditure the
clear lead of the city states, which only partlydiminishes when the local authorities of theother Länder are included in the calculation,is likewise apparent. The centrally locatedamenities and expenditure on social benefits,which is far above average, play a role here.The city states also record the highest figuresfor expenditure on staff.
12The level of ex-
penditure of the east German Länder is like-wise very high, the main reason being thegrants to the local authorities. It is remarkablein the case of the Flächenländer in western
Germany that per capita expenditure in mostbeneficiary Länder is greater than in thedonor Länder provided the donor Länder’sequalisation payments are deducted.
There are also considerable differences in
interest expenditure. Expenditure by the citystates on this is likewise far above the Federalaverage. Despite the aid paid since 1994 forthe amortisation of its excessive debt, Bre-men’s interest payments in 2000 were still
12For example, in 1998 expenditure on social benefits
represented an additional burden of just over DM 412bil-
lion for the city state of Berlin compared with the Länder
average (including local authorities). In the case of total
expenditure on staff the difference recently amounted to
just over DM 3 billion.Position in the

71“Modernising” Länder administrations
Many municipalities introduced reforms at
the beginning of the nineties in an effort toincrease the cost-effectiveness of the servicesthey provide. Now, some of the Länder Gov-ernments are trying to do the same. The basicthinking behind these new managementmodels is to move away from the traditionalmethod of steering administrations, whichwas to allocate funds that had been agreed indetail centrally (“input management”), and,instead, to concentrate on setting targets forthe services that are to be provided (“outputmanagement”). Decisions on the precise allo-cation of the funds provided to achieve theseaims have then to be taken on a decentralisedbasis because the persons concerned knowbest where potential savings can be madeand are likely to be resolute in their pursuit ofcost-saving policies if their units get a share ofthe savings made. If the cost of providing ser-vices can be made transparent, areas wheresavings can be made will be revealed simplyby comparisons with the other Länder.
However, there are often problems in defin-
ition, especially with respect to the quality ofthe services to be provided. For example, it isnot easy to assess the output of an education-al institution. Even so, there are promisingsigns that the very introduction of parts ofthe reform models such as the decentralisa-tion of decisions concerning the allocation offunds is resulting in increased efficiency.
Such reforms have already been implemented
in the personnel field in some Länder or theyhave at least been tried out. According to in-terim reports, substantial savings appear tohave been achieved in Hesse during the firstyear of implementation. A further increase insavings is expected in the next few years.
Cost calculations are also being increasingly
applied. The aim here is to make the cost-effectiveness of the authorities’ activities
more transparent and to improve it. In aneven more radical step Hesse and Bremen areintroducing commercial accounting. Whenthe changeover is complete, this will showtheir respective assets and liabilities positions,which means that, in the event of bad man-agement, reductions in net assets will be re-vealed. If, however, a detailed overall pictureof public finance is to be obtained from thestatistics in future, too, it will still be necessaryfor these two Länder to report data whichcan be integrated into the various sub-divisions of the governmental accounting sys-tem still used by the majority of the Länder.
It is also becoming increasingly common to re-
move certain operations from the corebudgets. The main aim of these measures is topromote cost-cutting attitudes. At the begin-ning of 2001, for example, North Rhine-West-phalia removed its building departmentalong with the latter’s buildings and landfrom the Land budget. The various Land insti-tutions must now pay cost-covering rents tothis enterprise, which, in turn, pays interestreimbursements to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia for its borrowing in previousyears. However, the greater efficiencyachieved by this also poses some problems.For example, re-organisational measures ofthis nature impair the comparability ofbudget figures over time and also their com-parability with other individual Länder. Thereis also the danger that shadow budgets couldarise and that loans would be taken up to fi-nance them off the core budget. However,the Land would ultimately have to assume li-ability for them. Another factor is that, wherethere is a growing number of public enter-prises, care must be taken to ensure thatthere is adequate control. On the whole, itwould be advisable to privatise such out-sourced undertakings, where possible.

72more than DM12billion above the German
average (the local authorities included). Theequivalent figure for Hamburg amounted toalmost DM 1 billion and for Berlin just underDM 2 billion. On the other hand, Bavaria,owing to its low debt level, had savings ofabout DM 3 billion on interest paymentscompared with the national average.
In order to satisfy pent-up demand the east
German Länder have been very much in thelead when it comes to investment expend-iture. Of the west German Flächenländer only
Bavaria, owing to its low debt level, and theSaarland, which benefits from the FederalGovernment’s grants to assist it in amortisingits excessive debt, have been achieving theoverall national average of the Länder.
If, by way of a summary, an attempt were
made to put the current budget positions ofthe individual Länder into some kind of order,it would emerge that the city states are underthe most financial strain. Although they havethe highest level of receipts, their expenditureexceeds the Länder average by an even great-er margin. This applies to Berlin in particular.A very high structural expenditure level is evi-dent here, and the budgetary situation hasdeteriorated even further compared with2000 as a result of the enormous burden aris-ing from participating interests. All in all, thefinancial situation of the east German Flä-
chenländer is less favourable than in the
west. Yet substantial differences emergehere, too. One striking feature is the com-paratively favourable position in Saxony,which is primarily due to the relatively lowlevel of expenditure there. Regarding thebudgetary position, Bavaria comes off best
among the Länder. It is among the states withthe lowest expenditure per inhabitant, notleast because of its small interest burden, andlast year it ran a budget surplus. Bavaria isalso the only Land which has succeeded in“graduating” permanently from a beneficiaryLand to a donor Land under the revenue-sharing scheme. The situation in both Hesseand Baden-Württemberg must also bedeemed to be relatively favourable, particu-larly with respect to the budget balance in2000. The Saarland likewise had a favourablefinancial balance, but that was the result ofthe large aforementioned grants from theFederal Government.
Outlook
Following the earlier progress made in redu-
cing Länder budget deficits, these will in-crease substantially again in the current year.The shortfall in revenue resulting from the TaxReduction Act is being estimated at DM 19billion, or 4% of the total expenditure vol-ume, for 2001. Given their expenditure struc-ture, the Länder have difficulty in achievingthe necessary short-term savings to compen-sate for these shortfalls. However, manyLänder had used the unexpectedly large taxrevenues during the past few years to createreserves to enable them to offset lower re-ceipts without incurring larger amounts ofnew borrowing. Just over DM 7 billion ofsuch reserve funds have been earmarked inthe budgets for this year. However, like salesof assets, which in the original budget esti-mates were likewise intended, at almost

73Limitations on new borrowing
The constitutions of the Länder contain provi-
sions which govern the limitations on newborrowing and which, as a rule, are consistentwith the provisions laid down in Article 115of the German Constitution. Accordingly, theupper limit on new borrowing under normalcyclical conditions is the sum of investmentexpenditure in budgetary terms. This includesexpenditure on building and other invest-ments. The acquisition of fixed assets and par-ticipating interests, loans granted and invest-ment grants to both the public and privatesectors belong to the second category. Asthese grants do not increase the Land’s pri-mary assets, financing them via loans ultim-ately impairs the Land’s assets and liabilitiesposition. Furthermore, when the upper limitfor net borrowing is being determined, de-preciations, sales of assets or reductions in re-serves are not deducted from the volume ofinvestment. Sometimes this can also result ina Land not maintaining its net assets and li-abilities position even when the limits on newborrowing are observed. As a rule, however,investment grants received from other levelsof government and contributions from theprivate sector to finance investment are de-ducted. In Hesse, in particular, the limit onnew borrowing is much stricter still because,for example, investment grants financed viathe tax-sharing arrangement with the munici-palities may not be used to justify borrowing.
However, the upper limits on new borrowing
apply only for the purpose of drawing up thebudget. In the course of implementing thebudget borrowing may exceed the invest-ment volume if investments are not carriedout as planned or there are still unused credit
authorisations from previous years.
In view of the large shortfalls in revenue fol-
lowing the introduction of the tax reformwhich was also endorsed by a majority of theLänder Governments, many Länder came closeto their constitutional limits on debt whendrafting their budgets. If it had not been for –in some cases very extensive – withdrawalsfrom reserves, asset sales, estimates of justvaguely predictable savings in the form ofglobal cuts in expenditure which are not yetspecified and the use of a very broad defin-ition of investment,
1numerous Länder would
have been unable to observe these limits.
The Maastricht Treaty limits the general gov-
ernment deficit (as defined in the national ac-counts) to a maximum of 3% of GDP. Fouryears ago, at the insistence of Germany, inparticular, the member states of the EuropeanUnion committed themselves in the Stabilityand Growth Pact to achieving the medium-term objective of budgetary positions close tobalance or in surplus in order to ensure a sus-tainable government financial position andto prevent conflicts of interest between mon-etary and fiscal policy. However, the deficitratio of 1
12% targeted for the current year in
the German stability programme of October2000 does not yet meet this goal. If this is tobe implemented on a federal basis, all levelsof government should strive for a balancedbudget. Considerable efforts are thereforestill necessary on the part of the Länder, too,if the European commitments are to be ful-filled.
1For example, Lower Saxony is treating its payments to
offset the Expo deficit not as a current grant but as theacquisition of a participating interest.

74DM 10 billion, to make a large contribution
to limiting new borrowing, such receipts areavailable only once. They can conceal theneed for permanent restrictions on expend-iture only in the short term. Efforts to improvethe economic efficiency of Länder servicescould help to achieve such restrictions (seethe overview on page 71).
In spite of the withdrawals from reserves,
sales of assets and the budgeting of globalcuts in expenditure not yet specified, the levelof net borrowing scheduled in the currentbudgets of numerous Länder is only justbelow the constitutionally prescribed ceilings(see the overview on this issue on page 73).In the case of Berlin this threshold has beenexceeded since 1993 in the opinion of theLand Court of Auditors. The financial prob-lems posed by the participating interests ofthe Land are increasing the gravity of thebudgetary situation even more. The Länder’soverall financial position in the current year is
very strained. In the next few years additionalfinancial burdens will arise as a result of thefurther tax reductions already agreed, themeasures to promote private old-age pro-vision and the planned increase in childbenefit.
Despite the foreseeable difficulties, most Län-
der aimed in their medium-term financialplanning last year to reduce net borrowingsubstantially in the next few years. Like theFederal Government, numerous Länder aretrying to dispense with new borrowing from2006. The achievement of balanced budgetsmight also be promoted if – as in the case ofBavaria with its budget system that will comeinto force in 2006 – statutory legislation in-creased the pressure to consolidate. The needfor a substantial reduction in expenditure inthe Länder budgets is obvious.

75Ageing, financial
markets andmonetary policy –the Bundesbank’sspring conference2001In early May, the Bundesbank organ-
ised an academic conference at whichthe links between population ageing,the ensuing developments on the fi-nancial markets and possible implica-tions for central banks were discussed(see the overview on page 76). It wasapparent that central banks may, inthe future, be affected by this phe-nomenon in several different respects.
Population ageing in industrial countries has
been discussed in academic circles for manyyears and is also increasingly becoming afocus of political debate. As a result of longerlife expectancy, on the one hand, and thelower birth rate, on the other, the indicationsare that in Germany, for instance, the ratio ofover-60s to people of working age (i.e. agedbetween 20 and 60) will double in the dec-ades to come.
In the past, discussions have focused on the
challenges which an ageing society presentsin terms of social security systems and the la-bour markets. However, structural changes inthe age profile can also be expected to havean impact on many other areas of economiclife. In particular, there are expected to be im-plications for the financial markets and mon-etary policy.
An important starting point for many consid-
erations is the projected need to modify exist-ing pay-as-you-go pension systems – still thepredominant structure in Germany (as indeedin many other countries) – and to supplementthem or partly replace them by other pensionPopulation

76schemes. These schemes work by building up
a capital stock which is then used to financefuture pensions. During the conference, theconsensus was that it is both necessary andadvantageous to increase pension funding.
Of greater significance is the issue of whether
attributing a greater role to funded pensionschemes will affect national savings. In-creased savings coupled with a larger capitalstock could be a means of promoting growth,thus placing old-age pension provision on asounder footing. Past experience is not easilyinterpreted in this connection. In addition tothe impact of institutional aspects, saving isdependent on many other factors, such as,in particular, income growth, which makesit difficult to isolate the role of pensionschemes. Moreover, the situation with regardto related data in Europe is not very satisfac-tory. At the conference, drawing on the an-alysis of an economic policy “experiment” inItaly, the theory was advanced that house-holds react by making far greater efforts tosave if their anticipated pension entitlementfrom the statutory, pay-as-you-go pensionscheme is limited. This bolsters the position ofthose promoting the funding of pensions.
The problem of ageing populations is affect-
ing most western industrial countries, albeitto differing degrees. By contrast, developingcountries are frequently confronted withproblems of a population that will continueto grow in the foreseeable future. The inter-national flow of capital can act as a “bridge”in this respect. In countries in which the prob-lems of an ageing society are particularlyacute, more money is put into savings.

77ital is allowed to move freely, these additional
savings are also likely to flow into economieswith better demographic trends, in whichthere will be a particular shortage of capital inthe future and an above-average yield can beexpected. This diversification opportunitythus lightens the burden of old-age pensionprovision.
Against this background, a high outflow of
capital from Germany can probably be ex-pected in the coming decades (followed laterby a reverse transfer of funds). Computation-al simulations presented during the confer-ence suggest that capital outflow will in-crease until around 2020 and will amount, atits peak, to more than 5% of the nationalproduct. Capital outflows will be especiallylarge if pension reform pursues the line ofmaking greater use of funding. In addition,these calculations suggest that the greatestproportion of capital outflows is channelledto other European countries, because consid-erable impediments to the flow of capital intoeconomies that are still underdeveloped arelikely to continue to exist. In order to over-come future ageing problems, it is importantto improve the general conditions ensuringfree and efficient movement of capital.
There are a number of new risks at various
levels associated with population ageing. Fi-nancial market innovations are devised notleast in order to make it easier to containthese risks. At the level of individuals who arehaving to cater for their old age, it is, for ex-ample, important, given that they do notknow how long they will live, for them tomake sure that their savings are not used upprematurely, while at the same time ensuring
that they are not obliged to save too muchin their old age. As a means of reducingthese risks, for some time it has been possiblein some countries – and increasingly so inothers – to enter into a contractual arrange-ment which guarantees an annual (possiblyeven index-linked) pension until death in re-turn for payment of a fixed sum (annuities).Particularly for risk-averse investors, this kindof pension plan is an important facet of old-age pension provision. The acceptability ofthese measures is likely to be dependent onhow a fair price for such life pensions mightbe calculated and how these instruments arepromoted in future. Appropriate supervisionand regulation of the providers of theseagreements play a particular role in this re-spect.
The problems of an ageing society can, of
course, be alleviated by appropriate old-agepension schemes and financial innovations;the basic issue of burden-sharing between“old” and “young” nonetheless continues toexist. Some examples are given to clarify howdifferent old-age pension schemes allow spe-cific risks to be borne by different gener-ations. A pay-as-you-go system leading to afixed pension burdens the members of thepopulation of working age with all the risksof unforeseen developments in populationgrowth, in terms of future average life ex-pectancy or macroeconomic productivity. Afunded system in which shares are purchasedin order to provide for a pension transfers theproductivity risk (in part) to the generation ofpensioners; on the other hand, a system inwhich the state incurs debt by selling fixed-

78interest securities (which are purchased by
future pensioners with a view to providing apension) leads to people who will in future beof working age – and who will have to re-deem the government paper – having to beargreater risks. Against this background, con-cepts were presented of how, for example,new types of government paper might con-tribute to a more efficient way of spreadingthe risk across the generations. Among otherthings, the possibility of issuing long-termgovernment paper was discussed, the returnon it being linked to future wage develop-ments or to average life expectancy. In thisconnection, it is also important for the dis-tributive effects to be taken into account intaxation. This applies, for instance, if invest-ment income tax is mainly paid by the (well-off) older generation. In this connection, ithas become clear that the spread of risks be-tween “old” and “young” can only be cor-rectly assessed if all relevant elements areconsidered together. It therefore appearsproblematic to discuss specific parts of anold-age pension reform in isolation.
At the conference there was also discussion
of whether dealing with the problem of anageing population can lead to risks for thestability of the national financial system (orrather, how to keep such risks to a minimum).In a pay-as-you-go scheme, the burdensplaced on the younger generation could turnout to be unsustainable in the long run (orelse the promises of old-age pension provi-sion become increasingly implausible). If thereactions of households were to demonstrateinsecurity or if the response of fiscal policywere to increase taxes or government debt,evasive action might well be taken and this
could, in the end, also affect the stability ofthe financial systems. A simple example is theinterest rate increase generated by the result-ant, permanently higher and rising govern-ment debt, with far-reaching implications forthe financial systems. In a funded pensionscheme in which pension funds play a keyrole, problems might, however, also occur be-cause – possibly owing to unhelpful incentivestructures – such funds impede the smoothfunctioning of the financial markets. Exces-sive volatility, liquidity crises and such likemay be the outward expression of such short-comings. The debate about how serious suchproblems will be in the future and whatmeasures are appropriate to counter unwel-come developments will intensify further inthe coming years. Central banks, one of thetasks of which is to ward off the dangers ofsystemic risks in the financial systems as far aspossible, will be encouraged to review newlysuggested solutions and to put forward theirown ideas for discussion.
The narrower field of monetary policy is also
affected by changes in the age structure. Itneeds to ask itself whether indicators thatare currently used to guide monetary policywill change or lose their informative value,whether changes in the monetary transmis-sion process will occur and finally whether, inan ageing society, the objectives of monetarypolicy will also be redefined.
The aforementioned implications for inter-
national capital transactions clearly demon-strate the need to take account of the prob-lems posed by ageing societies when inter-

79preting economic indicators. These transac-
tions have, in turn, an impact on the rates ofexchange and the global current account pat-tern. In addition, the equilibrium real interestrate used as an analytical concept by severalcentral banks is also affected; it is likely to beviewed differently depending on the demo-graphic trend and the actual old-age pensionstructure concerned. Much the same appliesto a number of other variables which monet-ary policy occasionally takes as indicators.
As far as the transmission process is con-
cerned, consumer reactions to monetary pol-icy measures were, in particular, analysedduring the conference. Model calculationswere used to show that these reactions canbe very different, depending on whether thehouseholds are mainly young with limitedsavings or elderly with above-average savings.Whereas credit restriction problems are morelikely to exist among young households, ifmonetary policy is tightened, monetary policymeasures can have particular repercussionsfor wealthy households in terms of the valueof their financial assets. Moreover, the mon-etary transmission process is influenced to alarge extent by the financial system con-cerned. Changes in this area which, for ex-
ample, have been brought about by restruc-turing old-age pension provision, thereforealso affect the transmission channels of mon-etary policy. Finally, the question was raisedof whether an ageing society attributes aparticularly high value to price stability, andwhether, in a society in which old-age pen-sion provision is mainly secured by buildingup capital stock, price stability is accorded agreater role than in a pay-as-you-go scheme.Further empirical analyses are needed in thisfield.
Overall, the conference helped to sharpen
awareness of the fact that central banks alsoneed to take account of future changes in theage profile of our societies in their deliber-ations. Such adjustments may have a bearingon the macroeconomic framework withinwhich central banks work. They also affectthe impact of monetary policy.
The conference papers are to be published.
