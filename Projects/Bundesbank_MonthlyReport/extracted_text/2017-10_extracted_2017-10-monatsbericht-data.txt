Economic conditions
Underlying trends
Germany’s steep economic upswing continues 
and in the third quarter of 2017 may well have 
maintained the brisk pace of growth seen in 
the first six months of the year. The industrial 
sector has probably maintained its role as a 
crucial pillar of strong economic activity on the 
back of buoyant export demand, with indus -
trial order books in an excellent state. This also 
holds true for sentiment amongst enterprises in 
the manufacturing sector which, according to 
the Ifo Institute, remains at an exceptionally 
high level despite a slight dip in September. By 
contrast, following the very robust first six 
months, the construction sector is unlikely to 
make any further contribution to aggregate 
growth for the time being. Nevertheless, it is 
expected that construction activity will be able 
to largely maintain the high level previously 
reached. Another record high for the business 
climate in this sector suggests the construction 
boom will continue. Retail sales were fairly 
lacklustre of late and private consumption 
might be growing somewhat more moderately 
following the strong uptick in the first and 
second quarters of 2017. In the light of the very 
upbeat sentiment among consumers and the 
favourable labour market and income outlook, 
a sustained deterioration in the propensity to 
consume is not expected, however.
Industry
Industrial output posted exceptionally strong 
growth in August, exceeding the previous 
month’s level by 3¼% in seasonally adjusted 
terms. Taking the average of July and August, 
output likewise increased sharply (+1¾%) com -
pared with the level of the second quarter. In 
particular, motor vehicle manufacturers more 
than made up for the rather modest develop -ment over the preceding few months and 
stood out with quite considerable output 
growth (+4½%). Capital goods output there -
fore showed the strongest expansion overall 
(+2%) but producers of intermediate (+1¾%) 
and consumer goods (+1½%) also recorded 
substantial growth in production.
Seasonally adjusted industrial orders rose 
sharply in August on the month (+3¾%). Tak -
ing the average of July and August, the volume 
of orders also clearly exceeded the average re -
corded in the second quarter (+2¼%). Broken 
down by the most significant regions of the 
world, German manufacturers reported dy -
namic demand mainly in the non- euro area 
countries (+5%), in particular due to large 
orders. Industrial enterprises also reported 
steep increases in the volume of orders on do -
mestic markets (+2½%). By contrast, signifi -
cantly fewer new orders were received from 
the euro area (-1¾%) but excluding large 
orders, a considerable rise was recorded here, 
too. In the breakdown by sector, primarily 
intermediate goods met with brisk demand 
(+4½%). The order books of the capital goods 
sector were also significantly fuller (+1½%). 
Manufacturers of consumer goods, on the 
other hand, recorded slightly fewer new orders 
than in the second quarter (-½%).
Industrial turnover in August even posted a 
marginally stronger rise than output (+3½%) 
on the month after seasonal adjustment. On an 
average of July and August, there was also a 
substantial increase of 2% compared with the 
second quarter. As with output, capital goods 
manufacturers posted the strongest sales 
growth, followed by intermediate goods pro -
ducers. Only the turnover figures in the con -
sumer goods industry were not able to con -
tinue with the dynamic development of the 
previous quarter and fell slightly short of the 
figure recorded in the second quarter. The re -
gional breakdown shows that demand in -Germany’s

creased mainly abroad, with turnover up 
sharply both in the euro area and in the non-  
euro area countries. In line with this, nominal 
exports of goods rose substantially in August 
on the month (+3¼%). Taking the average of 
July and August, they were up markedly by ½% 
compared with the second quarter. In price-  
adjusted terms, the increase was slightly more 
significant at ¾%. In August, the month- on- 
month rise of 1¼% in nominal imports was 
relatively modest. On an average of July and 
August, imports were ¼% higher than in the 
previous quarter in terms of value. After the 
elimination of price effects, however, there was 
a substantial increase of 1½% due to the clear 
decline in import prices.
Construction
In August, construction output posted a signifi -
cant month- on- month decline in seasonally ad -
justed terms (-1¼%). On an average of July and 
August, the decrease was similarly substantial 
compared to the very strong second quarter. 
There was lower activity in both the main con -
struction sector (-1%) and in the finishing trades 
(-1¾%). New orders in the main construction 
industry in July –  figures are available up to 
then – also declined markedly compared with 
the second quarter. However, the overall pic -
ture of diminishing construction activity must 
be viewed in the light of the very robust first 
half of the year. Furthermore, business expect -
ations in the construction sector rose signifi -
cantly according to the Ifo Institute. The assess -
ment of the business situation even climbed to 
a new record high and the number of building 
permits also remained at a high level. The lower 
level of output should therefore not be re -
garded as a long- lasting setback for momen -
tum in the construction sector.

seasonally adjusted number of persons in work 
overall in Germany went up by 64,000 on the 
month. Similarly, in comparison with August 
last year, there was an exceptionally steep in -
crease of 1.6% or 692,000. The extremely large 
rise in the number of jobs subject to social se -
curity contributions has remained responsible 
for this favourable development throughout. 
This also applies if one takes into account that 
the reference value of +888,000 employees for 
the same month one year earlier – the first es -
timate here referring to July – has an upward 
bias.1 There was a further decline in the num -
ber of persons working exclusively in low- paid 
part- time jobs. By contrast, the number of self- 
employed persons was stable in recent months. 
Leading indicators of the demand for labour 
such as the Ifo employment barometer, the 
Federal Employment Agency’s BA-  X job index 
or the labour market barometer of the Institute 
for Employment Research (IAB) are all at an ex -
ceptionally high level, suggesting the positive 
job growth is set to continue in the next few 
months.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment in Septem -
ber fell significantly on the month, after rather 
moderate growth in the preceding months. 
There were 2.51 million persons registered as 
unemployed according to the Federal Employ -
ment Agency. The unemployment rate declined 
by 0.1  percentage point to 5.6%. Compared 
with the same month one year earlier, 159,000 
fewer persons were out of work, and the un -
employment rate was 0.4  percentage point 
lower. Total underemployment including per -
sons taking part in labour market policy meas -
ures contracted on a similar scale compared 
with August. The fall in unemployment was 
therefore not caused by greater use of labour 
market policy instruments. The unemployment 
component of the IAB labour market barom -
eter has clearly climbed into positive territory 
again and thus indicates a decline in unemploy -
ment in the next few months.Prices
Crude oil prices continued to rise in September, 
with an increase of just over 6¾% on the Au -
gust level. The price rise was still driven by ex -
pected production cutbacks, on the one hand, 
but, at the same time, stronger demand also 
played a role. Crude oil prices went up further 
in the first half of October (+2% on the month). 
As this report went to press, the price of a bar -
rel of Brent crude oil stood at US$57½. The 
discount on crude oil futures was US$1¼ for 
deliveries six months ahead and US$2 for 12 
months ahead.
Import prices remained largely unchanged in 
August in seasonally adjusted terms. The ap -
preciation of the euro is not likely to have had 
any further impact on the prices of industrial 
goods and energy became only moderately 
more expensive. By contrast, industrial produ -
cer prices, for which data are already available 
for September, continued to go up slightly both 
in aggregate terms and excluding energy. The 
year- on- year figure remained more or less un -
changed overall at 2.1% in the case of import 
prices and increased to +3.1% in the case of 
industrial producer prices.
At a seasonally adjusted 0.3%, consumer prices 
(HICP) continued to rise in September. This was 
due primarily to higher prices for refined petrol -
eum products. Services, including rents, and 
food also became slightly more expensive. The 
prices of non- energy industrial goods were 
marginally higher in spite of the steep appreci -
ation of the euro. Annual headline HICP infla -
tion held steady at +1.8% (CPI inflation also 
unchanged at +1.8%) and HICP inflation ex -
cluding energy and food remained at +1.5%. Substantial rise 
in employment; very positive outlook

1 This is based on figures for employment subject to social 
security contributions being underreported for June and 
July 2016 owing to a processing error in the registration of 
jobs subject to social security contributions at the Federal 
Employment Agency. According to the Federal Employ -
ment Agency, although the figures relating to August last 
year onwards were corrected in spring 2017, the revision of 
June and July 2016, the first two months affected, is not 
planned until a later point in time.Deutsche Bundesbank

Initially, headline inflation is likely to more or 
less retain the level reached recently but could 
fall again around the turn of the year due to a 
dampening baseline effect.
Public finances2
Local government finances
Local government core budgets and off- budget 
entities ran a cash surplus of €5½ billion in the 
second quarter of 2017, having posted a sur -
plus of just over €3 billion a year earlier. Rev -
enue continued to rise steeply (by 6½%, or €4 
billion). Tax receipts grew in step with the very 
favourable developments in the municipal 
share of income tax and the local business tax, 
and rose by as much as 10% (€2½ billion). 
There was also a clear increase in transfers 
from state government and in receipts from 
fees; the latter was again primarily due to a 
special effect in North Rhine-  Westphalia.3
At just under 3% (€1½ billion), growth in total 
expenditure was much more subdued. Once 
again, the rise in spending on personnel (+6%, 
or €1 billion) made a strong impact. This rise is 
attributable to the fact that in the second quar -
ter of 2016 the increase under the first adjust -
ment stage of the spring 2016 collective wage 
agreement had not yet been paid out and, as 
of February 2017, the next increase had already 
entered into force. Growth in other operating 
expenditure was 4% (€½ billion) and resulted 
in mathematical terms from the special effect 
in North Rhine-  Westphalia alone. This increase 
is likely to have been dampened, in particular, 
by the decline in the number of refugees to be 
supported. As a result, spending on social 
benefits fell, too (by a total of 2½%, or €½ bil -
lion), eased by a fall of just over one- third in 
expenditure on asylum seekers (-€½ billion). 
This reflects the fact that by granting a large 
number of asylum seekers refugee status, the 
lion’s share of means-  tested social benefits 
(basic allowance) has been transferred to cen -
tral government. After a particularly sharp rise in the same period last year, fixed asset forma -
tion remained unchanged. Against this back -
drop, construction expenditure even declined 
on the whole, although developments varied 
widely across the individual federal states.
A slight surplus of €½ billion was recorded for 
the first half of the year, compared with a def -
icit of €3 billion for the same period last year. 
The positive underlying trend is expected to 
continue, although the improvement in year-  
on- year terms going forward is likely to be 
curbed by the very strong final quarter of 2016. 
As of next year, additional central government 
funds of €2½ billion will be forwarded to the 
municipalities to help ease the burden of social 
benefits. The macroeconomic outlook is also 
set to remain favourable. The financial position 
of local government is thus likely to improve 
further overall, even though some municipal -
ities are still faced with a high need for consoli -
dation. Yet, all in all, together with central gov -
ernment’s fund to promote municipal invest -
ment of financially weak local governments 
(which has been used relatively little to date), 
there is significant scope to strengthen the mu -
nicipal investment as planned.
In the debt statistics,4 local government (to -
gether with its off- budget entities) recorded a 
debt level of €146½ billion at the end of the 
second quarter of 2017.5 Compared with the 
level at the end of the previous quarter, this Clear improve-

2 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain a detailed description of 
public finance developments during the preceding quarter. 
For detailed data on budgetary developments and public 
debt, see the statistical section of this report.
3 In the third quarter of 2016, new entities were added to 
the reporting group for the cash statistics in this state. As a 
result, the growth rates for revenue and expenditure were 
biased upwards for the last time in the second quarter of 
2017.
4 The Federal Statistical Office’s press release of 28 Sep -
tember 2016 states that the reporting group in the quar -
terly statistics used here was aligned to that in the annual 
statistics from 2016 onwards. The results are still marked as 
provisional.

signifies a reduction of €½ billion and is mainly 
related to the volume of cash advances, which 
amounted to €48½ billion at the end of June. 
A high level of debt per capita arising from 
these cash advances, which are actually only 
intended to bridge short-  term liquidity short -
falls, points to a strained financial situation. 
For  some years now, Saarland, Rhineland-  
Palatinate, North Rhine-  Westphalia and Hesse 
have recorded figures considerably in excess of 
those for Germany as a whole for their munici -
palities on aggregate. However, given the quar -
terly surpluses (with the exception of the muni -
cipalities in Saarland), some of which have 
been considerable, there has been a slight 
– albeit  still very limited – decline in the volume 
of cash advances in these four states, too, of 
late.
Securities markets
Bond market
At €87.8 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in August 2017 was only slightly 
up on the figure for the previous month. After 
deducting redemptions, which were consider -
ably lower, and taking account of changes in 
issuers’ holdings of their own debt securities, 
the outstanding volume of domestic bonds 
rose by €12.8 billion, compared with a drop of 
€17.3 billion in July. The outstanding volume of 
foreign debt securities in the German bond 
market increased by €1.7 billion.
In the reporting month, the public sector raised 
€16.2 billion net in the capital market. On bal -
ance, this was attributable entirely to central 
government (€16.8 billion), which issued pre -
dominantly two- year Federal Treasury notes 
(Schätze) worth €8.2 billion, ten- year Federal 
bonds (Bunds) totalling €5.6 billion and five-  
year Federal notes (Bobls) amounting to €3.7 
billion. By contrast, it redeemed principally 
Treasury discount paper (Bubills) (€1.5 billion) in 
net terms. State and local government reduced 
their capital market debt by €0.6 billion.Domestic credit institutions redeemed bonds 
totalling €1.8 billion net in August. On balance, 
only the outstanding volume of other bank 
debt securities which can be structured flexibly 
fell (€5.2 billion). Specialised credit institutions, 
meanwhile, issued debt securities to the tune 
of €2.4 billion net, while the issuance of mort -
gage Pfandbriefe totalled €1.1 billion.
Domestic enterprises reduced their capital mar -
ket debt by €1.6 billion in August, compared 
with net issuance of €8.2 billion in July. Chiefly 
long- term paper was redeemed.
In August, the Deutsche Bundesbank was the 
predominant buyer in the German bond mar -
ket on balance, acquiring debt securities for 
€9.9 billion net, primarily under the Eurosys -
tem’s asset purchase programmes. Domestic 
non- banks and foreign investors respectively 
added bonds worth €6.8 billion and €6.5 bil -
lion net to their portfolios. Conversely, German Net sales in the

credit institutions sold bonds in the amount of 
€8.7 billion on balance.
Equity market
In the month under review, domestic enter -
prises placed €0.2 billion net worth of new 
shares in the German equity market, all of 
which emanated from non- listed companies. 
At the same time, the outstanding volume of 
foreign shares in the German market rose by 
€2.1 billion. On balance, equities were acquired 
exclusively by domestic non- banks (€5.4 bil -
lion). By contrast, foreign investors and domes -
tic credit institutions offloaded shares worth 
€2.6 billion and €0.6 billion net respectively.
Mutual funds
In August, the inflows recorded by domestic 
mutual funds were significantly smaller than in the previous month (€0.9 billion compared 
with €9.7 billion). Retail funds and specialised 
funds reserved for institutional investors bene -
fited from these inflows in equal measure. 
Bond funds and funds of funds were able to 
place shares in the market (€1.5 billion and 
€0.6 billion respectively). Open- end real estate 
funds and mixed securities funds, by contrast, 
recorded outflows (€1.1 billion and €0.6 billion 
respectively). During the month under review, 
foreign mutual funds operating in the German 
market parted with shares totalling €3.0 billion 
net. Domestic non- banks were, on balance, the 
primary buyers of mutual fund shares (€3.3 bil -
lion). German credit institutions purchased 
mutual  fund shares totalling €0.5 billion net. 
On balance, non- resident investors were barely 
active  in the German mutual fund market.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €17.8 billion in August 2017, putting it €1.7 
billion below its July level. This was chiefly at -
tributable to an increased deficit on invisible 
current transactions, which comprise services 
as well as primary and secondary income. The 
surplus in the goods account improved, but 
only slightly.
In August, the surplus on the goods account 
was somewhat up on the month by €0.3 billion 
to €21.8 billion, with imports of goods falling 
more strongly than exports of goods.
The deficit on invisible current transactions 
went up by €2.0 billion to €4.0 billion in Au -
gust. This was due to deteriorations in the bal -
ances of the primary income and the services 
accounts which outweighed the decrease in 
the secondary income deficit. This deficit nar -
rowed by €0.9 billion to €3.5 billion, not least 
as a result of lower payments to the EU budget. 
By contrast, net receipts on primary income fell 
by €1.8 billion to €4.4 billion. On the one hand, 
there was a decline in income, especially that 
deriving from equity, but there was also a de -Little net

cline in earnings from investment fund shares 
and dividends from capital investment abroad. 
On the other hand, with regard to the corres -
ponding expenditure figures, the increase in 
dividend payments to non- residents more than 
offset the reduction in payments relating to the 
other two capital investment items. In addition, 
the deficit in the services account rose by €1.1 
billion to a level of €4.9 billion, largely as a con -
sequence of the usual seasonal increase in 
travel expenditure.
Although the international financial markets 
were invigorated by the pick- up in global eco -
nomic activity in August, at the same time, they 
were influenced by mounting geopolitical ten -
sions. Against this backdrop, German cross-  
border portfolio investment saw a dip in net 
capital exports, which were down by €30.8 bil -
lion on the month to €1.9 billion. German in -
vestors stepped up their foreign investment by 
€5.8 billion. On balance, they purchased mainly 
foreign mutual fund shares (€3.0 billion), but 
also debt securities (€1.7 billion) and shares 
(€1.1 billion). With respect to foreign debt se -
curities, their interest focussed on foreign cur -
rency bonds (€2.7 billion). In the month under 
review, foreign investors expanded their port -
folio investment in Germany by €3.9 billion. In 
particular, they acquired longer- term public 
sector debt securities (€8.7 billion), parallel to 
which they disposed of domestic money mar -
ket paper (€3.5 billion) and shares (€2.6 billion).
Direct investment led to modest net capital im -
ports (€0.2 billion) in August, having already 
generated inflows of funds in July (€1.4 billion). 
Net funds flowing into Germany in the shape 
of direct investment came to €6.2 billion, 
achieved on the back of intra- group lending 
(€4.2 billion) –  exclusively through financial 
loans – and the provision of equity capital (€1.9 
billion), primarily in the form of reinvested earn -
ings. Enterprises in Germany supplied their af -
filiates abroad with funds totalling €6.0 billion 
net. In the process, they augmented their

Global liquidity, foreign exchange reserves 
and exchange rates of emerging market 
economies
Global factors such as the provision of liquidity by central banks or the assessment of risk in the 
international equity markets have a significant impact on the capital flows between advanced 
economies and emerging market economies (EMEs). This recently became apparent in the context 
of the international financial crisis. An increase in global liquidity in times of low tension in the 
financial markets tends to exert upward pressure on the currencies of EMEs as investors from 
advanced economies are prepared to take greater risks in their pursuit of higher yields. However, 
this increases recipient countries’ vulnerability to turnarounds in sentiment if there is a change in 
risk assessment in the international financial markets.
Abrupt reactions in the exchange rate can be overwhelming to the adjustment potential of smaller 
(emerging market) economies, in particular, and weigh on the relevant country’s financial sector. 
As capital controls are often associated with major drawbacks and macroprudential measures 
may not suffice to absorb significant exogenous shocks, many EMEs try to stabilise or even com -
pletely fix the exchange rate of their currency by intervening in the foreign exchange market. This 
requires the accumulation of an adequate cushion of foreign exchange reserves. However, the 
eligible forms of investment produce comparatively low yields, which is why reserve holdings are 
usually associated with opportunity costs. Empirical studies conducted by the Bundesbank show 
that foreign exchange reserves can offer preventive protection against tensions in the foreign 
exchange markets. The relationship between reserve holdings and the stabilisation of the 
exchange rate is not linear, however; holding “excessive” foreign exchange reserves does not 
bring any additional benefit. Overall, a healthy mix of policy measures which takes into account 
the entire economic development of the relevant country seems to be the best way for EMEs to 
hedge against financial turmoil. Monetary policy decision- makers in the industrial countries ought 
to consider the impact of their monetary policy decisions on the exchange rates and capital flows 
of EMEs, as these have repercussions on the process of ensuring price and financial stability in the 
industrial countries’ own currency areas.Deutsche Bundesbank

Capital flows and exchange 
rate movements
Over the past few years, the experiences of 
some EMEs in the context of the global finan -
cial crisis have highlighted the strong impact of 
global factors on international capital flows. 
After the turn of the millennium, many EMEs 
initially recorded a steady rise in gross capital 
inflows; this was followed by the outbreak of 
the financial crisis in autumn 2008, when inter -
national capital flows plummeted and the flow 
of funds into EMEs declined significantly. Within 
a short space of time, EMEs’ currencies re -
corded in some cases considerable losses 
against the US dollar.1 Yet, from 2010 onwards, 
the low interest rates in the industrial countries 
– the result of an expansionary monetary policy 
pursued by various central banks, not least the 
US Fed’s securities purchase programme (quan -
titative easing)  – increasingly steered inter -
national capital flows back towards the higher- 
yielding assets of EMEs in Asia, Europe and 
Latin America which were not directly affected 
by the financial crisis.
The brief debate about whether the US  Fed 
was going to taper its securities purchases in 
spring 2013 (tapering talk) was accompanied 
by noticeable exchange rate reactions in the 
foreign exchange markets and capital outflows 
from some EMEs. For instance, the Brazilian 
real and the Uruguayan peso depreciated by 
more than 11% against the US dollar within 
three months (from end-  April to end-  July 
2013).2 The reactions by private investors, how -
ever, were relatively short- lived and limited to a 
few months.
However, in the two subsequent years, inter -
national investment in EMEs fell significantly. 
The decline affected EMEs in Asia – China in 
particular – more strongly than those in Europe 
and Latin America. With regard to investment 
instruments, developments were mainly driven 
by the fact that net purchases of EMEs’ debt 
securities came to a halt. Amongst other things, 
this is likely to have been caused by the actual scale- back of the Fed’s monthly purchasing vol -
ume at the time and the complete cessation of 
its purchase programme in October 2014.3 It is 
also striking, however, that lending by foreign 
banks to borrowers in China was negative in 
this period; this is likely to have been linked to 
doubts arising about China’s economic devel -
opment. In summer 2015, these doubts add -
itionally led to severe losses on Chinese equi -
ties.
Importance of global factors
Empirical studies have unanimously demon -
strated that capital flows between advanced 
economies and EMEs are largely influenced by 
factors such as the monetary policy of major 
economies’ central banks, risk assessment in 
the international equity markets and economic 
cycles across the globe.4 Although it is true that 
some importance can be attributed to the dif -
ferences in growth between recipient and ori -
gin countries, individual countries are limited in 
their ability to go beyond growth- enhancing 
policies and influence capital inflows and out -
flows through targeted economic policy meas -

This substantial dependence of EMEs on the 
financing  conditions in place in mature econ -
omies triggered a discussion in the academic 
literature and in international organisations 
such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF); 
this discussion has led to interventions in the 
free movement of capital being carefully re -
assessed. In particular, macroprudential policy 
measures, which are aimed at preventing sys -
temic crises in the financial system and may 
range from a more in- depth communication of 
warnings to specific provisions for ensuring a 
risk buffer, are deemed to be an integral part of 
a successful policy mix nowadays.6 However, 
measures that explicitly distinguish between 
residents and non- residents in a discriminatory 
manner (ie in the form of capital controls), in 
particular, risk not being deployed to achieve 
the primary objectives and, instead, being ab -
used for protectionist purposes, thereby pro -
voking retaliatory measures by non- residents. 
This would result in welfare losses.
It is for this reason that a policy aimed at pre -
venting sudden capital reversals and the associ -
ated harmful consequences for macroeco -
nomic stability is, generally speaking, preferable 
to compromising a country’s capital move -
ments altogether.
A widely used tool in this context is the holding 
of foreign exchange reserves. In principle, there 
are a number of conceivable motives for accu -
mulating reserves. On the one hand, EMEs 
could pursue “mercantilist motives”, gaining a 
competitive advantage at the international 
level by accumulating reserves to weaken their 
own currency. On the other hand, they could 
prepare for a scenario where sudden capital 
outflows might – without any intervention in 
the foreign exchange market – be followed by 
a sharp depreciation in the domestic currency 
along with the resulting risks to financial stabil -
ity.7 If an EME has sufficient foreign exchange 
reserves, it may avoid an excessive depreciation 
of its own currency by selling off these reserves, 
thus breaking or at least mitigating the trans -
mission mechanism outlined above. However, reserve holdings usually entail opportunity 
costs (see also page 22).
Exchange market pressure
In order to adequately convey the interaction 
between exchange rate reactions and changes 
in the foreign exchange reserves amidst tension 
in the foreign exchange markets, the concept 
of exchange market pressure (EMP) was intro -
duced in the literature. In its simplest form, 
EMP is calculated as the sum of the rates of

change reserves.8 A positive (negative) value in -
dicates upward (downward) pressure on the 
domestic currency, ie either an increase (de -
crease) in foreign exchange reserves and/ or an 
appreciation (depreciation) of the domestic 
currency against the currency of the base coun -
try (in this case, the US dollar). The underlying 
assumption of this definition is the notion that 
a country’s own currency would appreciate to 
a greater or depreciate to a lesser extent had it 
not purchased foreign currency, ie if the do -
mestic currency were in shorter supply.
The concept of EMP can be illustrated by the 
example of the Indonesian rupiah and its ex -
change rate against the US dollar following the 
outbreak of the financial crisis (see the above 
chart). The downward pressure on the Indo -
nesian rupiah was higher than the actual de -
preciation both when Lehman Brothers col -
lapsed in autumn 2008 and in the wake of the 
tapering talk in spring 2013. This was attribut -
able to a decrease in foreign exchange reserves, 
causing depreciation to weaken.9 By contrast, 
in the majority of the other observations de -
picted here, the upward pressure was higher 
than the actual appreciation. This pattern is 
consistent with the hypothesis that reserves 
were accumulated for precautionary reasons in 
order to later mitigate exchange rate reactions.Global liquidity and 
exchange  market pressure 
in EMEs
In the context of the debate on possible side 
effects of the expansionary monetary policy 
stance of the industrial countries, international 
effects are examined alongside potential do -
mestic effects such as the distortion of asset 
prices. A number of studies have thus shown 
that capital inflows into EMEs have increased in 
the wake of the advanced economies’ more 
expansionary monetary policy stance. By con -
trast, the impact on the foreign exchange mar -
kets of EMEs has been studied less. This is pre -International

Applied to the Postwar Canadian Experience, American

change in foreign exchange reserves, the absolute change

base of the previous period. However, O  Hossfeld and 
M Pramor in Global Liquidity and Exchange Market Pres -
sure in Emerging Market Economies, Deutsche Bundesbank 
Discussion Paper, forthcoming, show that the two meas -
ures of EMP are very highly correlated (for more on the 
different definitions, see also pp 19-20).
9 The gap between the EMP and the rate of change in the 
exchange rate does not provide straightforward insights 
into how strong the exchange rate reaction would have 
been without an intervention in the foreign exchange mar -
ket; it merely indicates whether the sign is positive or nega -
tive. To make an exact statement about the scope, one 
would first need to estimate how strongly the exchange 
rate reacts to interventions in the foreign exchange market.Deutsche Bundesbank

sumably attributable to the fact that the ex -
change rates in many EMEs over the last few 
decades were typically not freely flexible, but 
were to some extent at least influenced by the 
authorities (eg fixed exchange rates, currency 
board arrangements or exchange rate bands), 
making the results less meaningful if only the 
exchange rate movements are considered.10
For the reasons above, the impact of global 
liquidity  on the exchange market pressure in 
EMEs was examined in a recent empirical study 
by the Bundesbank. Before analysing the em -
pirical evidence, the fundamental question 
concerns the transmission channels through 
which monetary policy changes in advanced 
economies are able to impact on capital in -
flows and ultimately on the exchange market 
pressure in EMEs. Three closely intertwined and 
potentially mutually reinforcing channels are 
identified in the literature: the classic carry 
trade channel, the risk- taking channel and the 
funding liquidity channel.
Speculative transactions within which investors 
seeking higher yields try to exploit international 
interest rate differentials without hedging the 
exchange rate risk are known as carry trades.11 
A declining interest rate level in the advanced 
economies amidst an unchanged interest rate 
level in the EMEs would accordingly result in a 
widened interest rate differential, thus increas -
ing the appeal of carry trade positions in the 
currencies of EMEs.
Furthermore, monetary policy decisions may 
have an impact on market participants’ willing -
ness to take risky positions (referred to as the 
risk- taking channel). In this way, according to a 
study by Bruno and Shin (2015), a restrictive 
monetary policy shock results in reduced cross- 
border capital flows by means of an intensified 
deleveraging of banks.12 Closely related to this, 
an increase in short- term funding liquidity leads 
to a boost in international investors’ risk- taking 
propensity (known as the funding liquidity 
channel), according to Adrian (2015).13An analysis of the link between global liquidity 
and exchange market pressure in EMEs is first 
hampered by the fact that there is no standard 
definition of exchange market pressure in the 
literature; rather, a large number of competing 
definitions exist. Second, the concept of global 
liquidity is multifaceted, meaning that it is both 
more difficult to grasp and ultimately definition- 
dependent.14 Although the various indicators 
do have a common core, namely the ease of 
funding, the Bundesbank’s analysis shows that 
not all indicators are highly correlated with 
each other.

Global liquidity and exchange market pressure in emerging 
market economies
The aim of the econometric analysis pre-
sented here is to estimate the impact of global liquidity on exchange market pres-
sure (EMP) in emerging market economies 
(EMEs).1 The analysis is complicated by the 
fact that there is neither a clear defi  nition of 
global liquidity nor an indisputable defi  n-
ition of EMP . In view of this, the study takes into account a variety of global liquidity in-
dicators so as to refl  ect the multifaceted 
concept as accurately as possible. A simple 
correlation analysis of the indicators exam-
ined in the study also shows the need for 
this approach, since at least some of the in-
dicators are only weakly contemporan-
eously correlated.
For the sake of simplicity and clarity, the 
econometric model on which the analysis is based and the estimation results are initially 
examined for a selected defi  nition of EMP 
and three different liquidity indicators only. 
The econometric model, which was esti-
mated using panel fi  xed effects regressions with 32 EMEs and monthly data from Janu-ary 1995 to December 2015, is:

The dependent variable EMPit measures 
EMP in country i at time t. It is calculated as 
the sum of the percentage change in the 
exchange rate and the percentage change 
in foreign exchange reserves compared 
with the previous period.2 An increase rep-
resents appreciation in the exchange rate 
and/ or an increase in foreign exchange re-
serves. This defi  nition of EMP is based on 
the notion that exchange rate appreciation 
(depreciation) would have been more pro-
nounced if a central bank had not inter-vened in the foreign exchange market by purchasing (selling) foreign currency and thus weakening (strengthening) its own 
currency.
The explanatory variable GLjt denotes one 
of three alternative liquidity measures, which are used in turn as the regressor in 
the model: GLjt ∈{MBt, TCt, BLt}. Here, 
MBt represents the aggregate monetary 
base of selected advanced economies con-
verted into US dollars, TCt denotes total 
credit in advanced economies and BLt 
stands for the bank leverage ratio.3 Since 
both the monetary base and total credit are 
non- stationary, these two variables are in-corporated into the regression as differ-
ences in the logarithms, i e as growth rates.
In addition to the respective liquidity indica-
tor, the model contains a variety of control variables so as to reduce the risk of a biased 
estimator. The term (ii,t–1 – iUS
i,t–1) denotes 
the interest rate differential between the re-
spective EME and the United States in the 
previous period and ( �i,t–1 – �US
i,t–1) repre-
sents the difference in infl  ation rates, while 
the vector xi,t-1 comprises further control 
variables (dummy variables for a banking 
crisis and sovereign debt crisis and a meas-
ure of a country’s level of fi  nancial open-ness). The vector f
t includes other global 
factors that could have an impact on EMP 
in EMEs. These include energy prices, com-

modity prices (excluding energy) and global 
fi  nancial market uncertainty. The latter is 
approximated by the VIX, a measure of 
volatility for the US equity market, which is 
usually applied in the literature as a meas-
ure of global uncertainty. The adjacent table shows the estimation results for the simple 
measurement of EMP above and the three 
selected liquidity indicators.4
It is noteworthy that, for each of the three 
liquidity measures, irrespective of whether 
the monetary base, total credit or the bank leverage ratio is used as the liquidity indica-tor, an increase in the respective indicator is always associated with upward pressure on EME currencies.
However, as there is no consensus in the literature as to how precisely EMP should be defi  ned –  in terms of standardised weights or potentially also taking into ac-count an interest rate component, for in-
stance – it may be the case that the results only apply to the above defi  nition of EMP .
5 
To investigate this issue, the validity of the 
results, at least in qualitative terms, when 
using other conventional defi  nitions of EMP 
was explored. The fi  ndings show that the 
core result remains virtually unchanged – in other words, it is extremely robust.
The table at the top of page 20 shows a schematic overview of the estimation re-sults for eight different defi  nitions of EMP and seven indicators of global liquidity, as 
well as for a slightly modifi  ed model specifi  -
cation for EMP measures that include an 
interest rate component in addition to the 
exchange rate and foreign exchange re-
serve components.6
Ultimately, the question arises as to whether 
the manner in which EMP responds to changes in global liquidity hinges on the 
degree of tension on the fi  nancial markets – the anecdotal evidence seems to point in 
this direction, at any rate. To explore this 
issue, regime- specifi  c regressions were esti-
mated, meaning that the estimated coeffi   -
cients may differ depending on the regime. Observations of points in time at which the value of the VIX is below its 90% quantile 
are assigned to the low tension regime, 
while the rest are assigned to the high ten-
sion regime. The results for the standard 
4 The impact of two of the global factors, namely 
commodity prices and energy prices, on EMP were ini-
tially estimated heterogeneously, ie by country. As the estimation results for the key variables remain virtually 
unaffected by dropping homogeneity restrictions, however, the table here likewise contains only the homogeneous estimation results for the purpose of 
providing a clear overview. In the discussion paper, es-
timation results based on an expanded model with 
additional control variables are also presented. These 
do not differ substantially in qualitative terms from the results presented here, though.5 The rationale behind taking into account an interest rate component when calculating EMP is that an inter-est rate cut makes investing in domestic currency less attractive, thus lowering EMP .
6 In this case, the model’s explanatory variable is no 
longer the differential between interest rates at home 
and abroad but rather US interest rate growth; this 
prevents regressor endogeneity.Comparison of estimation results for selected liquidity indicators

defi  nition of EMP and the monetary base as 
the liquidity indicator are presented in the 
table below.
The results show that the impact of global 
liquidity is positive and signifi  cant only in 
times of low tension on the fi  nancial mar-kets. In times of heightened tension, by 
contrast, the liquidity indicator no longer 
has any signifi  cant impact on EMP in EMEs. 
This fi  nding is consistent with a pattern of 
investor behaviour characterised by rela-tively low risk aversion during periods of 
low tension on the fi  nancial markets, such 
that investors on a search for yield turn to 
EMEs. However, if tension is high and risk 
propensity lower, this transmission mechan-
ism appears to peter out. On the contrary, 
the negative sign and high statistical signifi  -cance of the term ∆ ln (VIX
t) suggest that 
an increase in tension in the stress regime is 
associated with marked downward pres-
sure on EME currencies – probably because 
investors then withdraw their capital from 
EMEs (see the box on pages 23 to 25). This fi  nding is also of relevance in terms of pol-
icy. It shows, on the one hand, that an in-
crease in monetary liquidity in advanced economies during periods of calm exerts 
upward pressure on EME currencies, which 
could increase their vulnerability in the Regime-specifi  c estimation results

2015 for a total of 32 EMEs, the Bundesbank 
study examines the extent to which global 
liquidity  affects the exchange market pressure 
in EMEs. In each case, one of eight alternative 
measures of exchange market pressure acts as 
a dependent variable and one of up to 17 
liquidity  indicators acts as a key explanatory 
variable. In addition, the model takes up to 11 
other potential determinants of exchange mar -
ket pressure into account in order to prevent 
results being distorted by the omission of rele -
vant variables. These include, for example, the 
interest rate differential between the respective 
EME and the United States, which acts as the 
base country for the purposes of the analysis, 
the difference in inflation rates, the develop -
ment of commodity prices, the degree of un -
certainty on the international financial markets, 
the degree of financial openness and the exist -
ence of a banking crisis in the EME.
Based on a number of different indicators, the 
results show that increased global liquidity is accompanied by upward pressure on the cur -
rencies of EMEs, and is largely independent of 
the selected definition of exchange market 
pressure. This applies both to simple monetary 
liquidity measures, such as the aggregate mon -
etary base of advanced economies or the ag -
gregated broad monetary aggregate M3, and 
the total credit volume or various measures of 
market liquidity (the bank leverage ratio or the 
outstanding amount of commercial paper in 
the United States). Of the other examined vari -
ables, the existence of a banking crisis in an 
EME has a particular impact on exchange mar -
ket pressure. The results show that a banking 
crisis is associated with considerable down -
ward pressure on the currency of the respective 
EME.
However, regime- specific regression results also 
show that this impact is restricted to times of 
relatively low tension on the financial markets. 
In times of heightened tension, an increase in 
various liquidity measures no longer results in a Increase in 
global liquidity associated with upward pressure on the curren-cies of EMEs

dependent on the degree of tension on the financial mar-kets, howeverevent of a sudden reversal of capital in-
fl  ows.7 On the other hand, the result also 
shows that, in times of crisis, the provision 
of additional liquidity in advanced econ-
omies would not directly culminate in a de-
crease in downward pressure on EME cur-
rencies via this channel as a result of the failure of the transmission mechanism de-scribed above. It is conceivable, however, that the monetary policy pursued by ad-
vanced economies could lower the degree 
of tension on the fi  nancial markets, which 
would – based on the results above – cause downward pressure to weaken.
7 This applies fi  rst and foremost to a scenario in which 
upward pressure is caused by appreciation in EME cur-rencies rather than by building up suffi   cient holdings of foreign exchange reserves.Deutsche Bundesbank

significant rise in exchange market pressure. 
This finding is consistent with a pattern of in -
vestor behaviour characterised by relatively low 
risk aversion during periods of low tension on 
the financial markets, such that investors in 
their search for yield turn to the EMEs. If ten -
sion is high, however, and risk propensity is 
lower (risk- off mode), this effect peters out, 
and the opposite occurs: in times of height -
ened tension on the financial markets, further 
increasing tension is linked to notable down -
ward pressure on the currencies of EMEs, pre -
sumably because investors then withdraw their 
capital from EMEs.15If the upward pressure on the currencies of 
EMEs in times of low tension is primarily attrib -
utable to appreciation of the domestic cur -
rency, and not to an increase in foreign ex -
change reserves, an expansionary or more ex -
pansionary monetary policy in the advanced 
economies may increase the vulnerability of 
EMEs.
Sufficient foreign reserves
It may be possible to limit this vulnerability with 
a sufficient stock of foreign exchange reserves. 
In particular, this could be expected to be the 
case if the reserves not only offset actual cap -
ital outflows, but from the outset also pre -
vented the danger of the sudden divestment by 
non- residents by bolstering confidence in the 
country concerned. However, the holding of 
foreign exchange reserves is usually connected 
with opportunity costs due to the compara -
tively low yields on safe and liquid assets. In 
addition, building up such reserves makes it ne -
cessary to have surpluses in the other (private) 
balance of payments transactions, although 
this should not pose a problem in an environ -Opportunity

Do suffi   cient foreign exchange reserve holdings reduce the 
probability of balance of payments crises?
On the basis of experiences with balance of 
payments crises in recent years, the Inter-
national Monetary Fund (IMF) has de-veloped an approach for evaluating the adequacy  of foreign exchange reserves (“assessment of reserve adequacy”). The fi  rst part of the two- stage procedure in-
volves identifying critical events which re-
sulted from sharp depreciations of the cur-
rency or from a massive loss of foreign ex-change reserves (exchange market pressure, EMP). Second, the scale of the liquidity out-
fl  ow such episodes threaten to trigger is 
calculated. External debt, the money in cir-
culation and potential export losses have proven to be key variables in the analyses 
carried out by the IMF. Under this approach, foreign exchange reserves are considered to be adequate if a country is in a position to cover 90% of the potential drains on liquid-ity calculated using this procedure.
1
The Bundesbank has replicated the IMF’s 
approach in its own calculations to measure exchange rate pressure. However, the Bank 
used the EMP index preferred by Hossfeld 
and Pramor,2 which differs slightly from the 
IMF’s defi  nition. The analysis presented here examines the extent to which a country- specifi  c currency buffer calculated 
using this approach helps mitigate the risk 
of balance of payments crises. The esti-
mates are carried out based on annual data 
from 32 emerging market economies and 
cover the period from 1996 to 2015.3
Two different crisis defi  nitions are applied 
when examining the suitability of foreign 
exchange reserves as a means of preventing 
balance of payments crises. The above- 
mentioned episodes of exchange market 
tension – that is, years marked by a strong 
depreciation of the domestic currency or a massive loss of foreign exchange reserves – 
are the basis for one estimate. An EMP 
index that is more than 1½ standard devi-
ations below the country- specifi  c average 
of the observation period serves as a thresh-
old level. An alternative estimate explores 
the extent to which a suffi   cient cushion of 
foreign exchange reserves can mitigate the 
threat of capital being drained by non- 
residents (defi  ned as negative gross capital 
infl  ows). Direct investment fl  ows are not 
taken into account here, as they are more 
likely to be linked to strategic objectives and typically do not trigger balance of payments 
crises. The estimates are carried out as 
panel regressions with random country ef-
fects.4

3 The selection of countries used for this study is in 
keeping with the panel of the study on the importance of global liquidity for exchange rate pressure in emer-ging market economies.4 A Hausman test does not reject the null hypothesis 
of the admissibility of an estimator with random ef-fects compared to an estimate with fi  xed country

value of one if foreign exchange reserves  
are considered to be suffi   ciently high, and 
zero if they are less than suffi   cient; i  = 
country indices; t = time index.6
Since the endogenous variable can only as-
sume values of zero or one depending on 
whether or not the year is a crisis year, a probit estimate is applied which specifi  es 
the likelihood of a crisis occurring in a given country at a given time.
The estimation results are summarised in 
the table above. The factors infl  uencing the 
likelihood of a crisis escalating in the for-
eign exchange markets are quite well cap-
tured by the model described. With the ex-ception of global liquidity, the possible con-
tribution of which cannot be backed by 
statistical evidence, all variables are signifi  -
cant and display the expected sign (col-
umn 1). The theory that an adequate stock of foreign exchange reserves is likely to pre-vent an abrupt depreciation of the domestic 
currency or necessary interventions by the central bank is likewise supported. How-
ever, foreign exchange reserves that exceed the level considered to be adequate do not 
lead to an additional stability gain ( EXC_
RES in column 2).7With regard to the likelihood of capital out-
fl  ows by non- residents, a foreign reserve buffer apparently does not offer any pre-ventive protection. The estimated coeffi   -
cients are not signifi  cant either in the base-
line model or in combination with add-itional reserve holdings. In line with other empirical studies, however, the analysis confi  rms that differences in economic 
growth between the recipient country and 
the euro area or the United States are of major importance for the cross- border fi  -nancial fl  ows of emerging market econ-omies.

for the capital movements of emerging 
market economies is also confi  rmed. This is true, at least for the danger examined here

ment of increasing investment inflows. It there -
fore seems appropriate to build up sufficient, 
but not excessive reserves.
The IMF has developed a method of determin -
ing an appropriate amount of foreign exchange 
reserves on the basis of a country’s financial 
and macroeconomic characteristics.16 Essen -
tially, this approach is intended to assess the 
extent of potential capital outflows which in 
times of crisis must be offset by reducing for -
eign exchange reserves. Times of crisis are de -
fined on the basis of exchange market pressure 
caused by foreign exchange market tensions as 
described above. These tensions are reflected 
in a depreciation of the domestic currency or a 
loss of foreign exchange reserves.17 The scale 
of the anticipated outflows is derived from pre -
vious crises and increases with the threat of de -
clining export activity, the external liabilities 
and the amount of money in the circulation.Empirical studies by the Bundesbank show that 
a sufficient stock of foreign exchange reserves 
calculated using this approach actually reduces 
the risk of tensions on the foreign exchange 
markets, and therefore also has a preventative 
effect. Holding additional or “excessive” re -
serves within the meaning of the model, on the 
other hand, has no stabilising effect beyond 
this, and is therefore ineffective (see the box on 
pages 23 to 25). In addition to a sufficient for -
eign exchange buffer, the economic develop -
ments in the respective EME and the advanced 
economies are also important here, as are 
global factors, particularly the risk assessment 
on the international financial markets.

change reserves has no significant impact on … of foreign

divestments by non- residents (ie capital 
outfl  ows affecting not only individual in-
struments or sectors) which result in nega-
tive gross capital infl  ows.
To conclude, it may be said that the likeli-
hood of balance of payments crises is largely determined by economic develop-ments in emerging market and advanced 
economies. Furthermore, global factors also 
play a role in the shape of the liquidity pro-
vided and uncertainty in the fi  nancial mar-
kets. A suffi   cient stock of foreign exchange 
reserves provides a certain degree of pro-
tection against possible distortions in the foreign exchange markets in the form of 
abrupt exchange rate adjustments or a loss 
of foreign exchange reserves. By contrast, 
there is no evidence that they are effective 
in preventing capital outfl  ows caused by 
the withdrawal of international investors.

the risk of an extensive divestment by foreign 
investors, which includes long- term forms of 
investment such as bonds and stocks. In the 
Bundesbank’s estimates, it is not possible to 
identify a link between the amount of official 
foreign exchange holdings and the probability 
of negative gross capital inflows in EMEs across 
all portfolio investment and other capital move -
ments, which mainly comprise loans and de -
posits. Instead, particular importance is attrib -
uted to the growth differential between the 
gross domestic product of the recipient country 
and that of the advanced economies. Global 
factors also play a role. For instance, a shortage 
of global liquidity or increasing uncertainty on 
the global equity markets significantly increases 
the probability of foreign capital outflows from 
the EMEs.
Conclusion
In summary, it can be concluded that monetary 
policy decisions in the industrial countries can 
also make a considerable impact on the foreign 
exchange markets of EMEs. It is worth noting 
here that although an increase in global liquid -ity in times of low tension on the financial mar -
kets puts the currencies of EMEs under upward 
pressure, this does not provide any immediate 
relief for the foreign exchange markets in times 
of crisis by bolstering the currencies of EMEs.
With this in mind, the monetary policy decision 
makers in the industrial countries should con -
sider the repercussions of possible exchange 
rate effects or potential capital movements 
when ensuring price and financial stability in 
their own area of responsibility. At the same 
time, it is the responsibility of the EMEs to en -
sure that their economies are more resilient to 
global factors. Apart from macroprudential 
measures, which are designed to promote the 
stability of the financial sector, it appears sens -
ible to also maintain an adequate stock of for -
eign exchange reserves as a buffer against sud -
den turnarounds on the foreign exchange mar -
kets in question. This instrument provides a 
certain degree of protection against short- term 
disruptions on these markets. However, it is not 
suited to preventing extensive private capital 
outflows which may arise as a result of deteri -
orating growth prospects in EMEs.… but no

The natural rate of interest
The concept of the natural rate of interest has been attracting increasing public interest in recent 
years. For some, the finding that there has been a persistent fall in long- term interest rates is 
proof of a decline in the equilibrium interest rate and of a simultaneous trend towards persistently 
low rates of growth (secular stagnation theory). Moreover, from a monetary policy perspective, 
the natural rate of interest is often seen as the key benchmark for adopting an accommodative 
or restrictive monetary policy stance. The latter presupposes that it can also be determined reli -
ably.
The natural rate of interest – defined by Knut Wicksell as the “rate of interest on loans which is 
neutral in respect to commodity prices” – is not directly measurable, however. Many of the 
methods of calculating the natural rate of interest do, in fact, point to a decline in a large number 
of developed economies since around the 1980s, reaching an exceptionally low level since the 
financial crisis. Even so, the estimated level of the natural rate of interest varies greatly depending 
on the method used and can often only be estimated with very wide uncertainty bands. The con -
siderable degree of estimation uncertainty suggests that a robust monetary policy strategy should 
not place too much emphasis on specific measures for the level of the natural interest rate.
In addition to the model uncertainties in calculation, conceptual differences are also responsible 
for heterogeneous results, with the two dimensions of time and risk being of particular import -
ance. The time dimension plays a role because in quantification methods, which take a short- term 
equilibrium as a basis, the natural rate of interest is much more volatile and is currently lower 
than in quantifications assuming a more long- term equilibrium. The risk dimension is not taken 
into account in any of the current quantification approaches for the natural rate of interest since, 
as a general rule, they use secure bond yields as a starting point, even though, with regard to the 
real economy, a risky return on capital would be a more appropriate indicator. Considering such 
measures for the return on equity or total capital, however, a protracted decline in yields cannot 
be ascertained, say, for Germany; the reduced yields on risk- free securities and corporate bonds 
stand in marked contrast to this.
Among the explanatory factors for sustained lower yields, there is, in view of this, more to sug -
gest an increase in demand for lower- risk assets and less to support the secular stagnation the -
ory, as this should also be reflected in the measures for the return on capital.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
The phenomenon of low interest rates is evi -
dent in Germany, like in most euro area coun -
tries, in Japan and in many other developed 
economies in the case of government bond 
yields, as it is in interest rates on savings de -
posits and mortgage loans. Low interest rates 
are often attributed to the action taken by cen -
tral banks. However, this way of seeing things 
neglects the fact that central banks – in terms 
of their monetary policy decisions  – are just 
one of many factors that determine long- term 
yields. This is because, even in an imagined 
world without a central bank, a rate of interest 
would materialise. Its level would result, among 
other things, from households’ propensity to 
consume or save, enterprises’ propensity to in -
vest and the propensity of economic agents to 
assume risks or to convert assets into liquidity 
without complications. In such a world, the 
greater the propensity to save and the lower 
the inclination to invest, the lower the interest 
rate would be, for example. Starting from this 
kind of thought experiment, the question arises 
as to whether such an interest rate is relevant 
and quantifiable in a world like ours, too, with 
money and central banks. About 120 years 
ago, the Swedish economist Knut Wicksell de -
veloped the concept of the natural rate of 
interest, which he summarised as follows: 
“There is a certain rate of interest on loans 
which is neutral in respect to commodity prices, 
and tends neither to raise nor to lower them. 
This is necessarily the same as the rate of inter -
est which would be determined by supply and 
demand if no use were made of money and all 
lending were effected in the form of capital 
goods. It comes to much the same thing as to 
describe it as the current value of the natural 
rate of interest on capital.”1
This natural rate of interest thus has two key 
features. On the one hand, it is linked to a 
goods market equilibrium and, on the other 
hand, to price stability. Measuring this natural 
rate of interest and understanding how it arises 
is of particular interest for monetary policymak -ers. This is because central banks can influence 
the short- term real interest rate relative to its 
equilibrium value by changing the short- term 
nominal interest rates, thereby influencing the 
real economy and inflation developments.2 If 
the key interest rate less the expected inflation 
rate is below the natural interest rate, it may be 
expected that households will use the oppor -
tunity of loans at relatively favourable rates to 
expand consumption; enterprises thereupon 
invest more, produce above potential in the 
goods market and raise their prices, which 
leads to an increase in the rate of inflation. If, 
on the other hand, the key interest rate less ex -
pected inflation is higher than the natural inter -
est rate, capacity underutilisation and falling 
inflation would be expected.
It is therefore not surprising that analysing the 
natural rate of interest is of particular import -
ance for central banks. Since this rate cannot 
be observed, however, models and estimation 
methods have to be relied on. The following 
section provides an overview of common 
methods of measuring the natural rate of inter -
est and their results. The final section assesses 
these findings.
Quantification
The natural rate of interest cannot be meas -
ured as a theoretical construct; rather, it re -
quires certain assumptions about the relation -
ship between measurable variables and the 
natural rate of interest in order for it to be 
quantifiable. In this respect, two dimensions 
prove to be especially important: time and risk. 
In the case of the time dimension, a short- term 
interest rate, such as a three-  month interest 
rate, is usually considered, which means that Natural rate of

forward premiums can be neglected. The nat -
ural rate of interest can be analysed in the long 
term when all the adjustment processes have 
been completed, or in the medium term when 
a large part of the adjustment processes can be 
completed, or in the short term when – driven 
by a possible large number of adjustment pro -
cesses – it shows a very high variability. With 
regard to the risk dimension, the original con -
cept of lending real capital is actually geared to 
a risky interest rate. However, this perspective 
has been lost in virtually all of the relevant 
model approaches, as they are, in fact, based 
on a rate of interest that is as secure as can be. 
With this shortened perspective, however, im -
portant information risks being lost, as can be 
demonstrated. Put in simple terms, the com -
monly used methods for determining the nat -
ural rate of interest can be divided into two 
groups: first, methods which draw conclusions 
about the natural rate of inflation from finan -
cial market data on real returns, and, second, 
methods which emphasise more strongly eco -
nomic transmission mechanisms and which, 
above all, do not attempt to determine the 
equilibrium interest rate independently of the 
economy’s growth potential.
Quantifications on the basis of 
bond yields
Owing to their very low default risk premiums, 
sovereign bond yields of fiscally sound coun -
tries are a good starting point for determining 
a virtually risk- free real, natural rate of interest. 
Nominal interest rates on government bonds 
can be broken down as follows (according to 
the Fisher equation):
yn = rn + En(π) + RPn(π) + liqn.
The nominal safe interest rate yn with a matur -
ity of n years is roughly equal to the sum of the 
safe real interest rate rn, the inflation expect -
ation En(π) and risk premiums for inflation un -
certainty RPn(π) as well as a premium for the 
differences in liquidity liqn between real and nominal bonds. Bonds whose coupons and re -
payments grow with inflation make it possible 
to directly determine a safe real interest rate rn 
which can be achieved over a specific period 
of time while maintaining purchasing power. 
From models of a term structure for real re -
turns, this can be used to determine different 
medium and long- term real interest rates of dif -
fering maturities as indicators of equilibrium 
real interest rates for the euro area (see chart 
above).3 Against the backdrop of growth the -
ory considerations, a long-  term equilibrium 
interest rate should not be noticeably below an Secure bond

economy’s potential growth rate over an ex -
tended period of time.4
The five- year real interest rates fell below 1% in 
2009 and have been on a declining trajectory 
since then, although the decline has been at a 
more moderate pace of late. They currently 
stand at below -1%. This measure still includes 
short- term adjustment effects from the econ -
omy and monetary policy, however. Closer to 
the concept of a medium to long- term natural 
real rate of interest are real forward rates, 
which do not contain any short- term develop -
ments. Until 2014, such long- term real rates 
(5y5y forward rates) were close to the long-  
term Consensus survey data on long-  term 
growth expectations, which cover more or less 
the same horizon. The real forward rates have 
fallen considerably since then and have been 
hovering around zero since 2015. By contrast, 
long- term growth expectations fell much less 
sharply during the observation period. In par -
ticular, the sharp decline in the real forward 
return  since 2014 is not found in the growth 
surveys.5
In this connection, the debate that has arisen 
about the Eurosystem’s asset purchase pro -
gramme since 2014 may have raised the pre -
miums for scarcity and liquidity, as a result of 
which the real rate shown in the chart is squeezed by non-  standard monetary policy 
measures, and the neutral real interest rate is 
underestimated.
The markets for inflation- linked bonds in the 
euro area and elsewhere are a rather new seg -
ment of the capital market and therefore do 
not allow a long historical analysis. That said, 
for making such a historical comparison, it is 
possible to calculate a real return from classical, 
nominal bond yields using survey- based infla -
tion expectations. The chart above shows real 
interest rates five years ahead for Germany, the 
United States and Japan.6 In line with develop -
ments in real yields on inflation- linked bonds, 
the chart on page 29 shows a steady decline 
across all the currency areas under analysis.Long-term real interest rate in various currency areas*

4 The necessary assumptions include, in particular, a utility 
function with constant relative elasticity of intertemporal 
substitution – so that the real interest rate moves one- for- 
one with real growth expectations – and that fluctuations

5 The deviation can also occur as a result of distortions in 
the formation of expectations in the survey data. Trad -
itional patterns, such as a delayed adjustment of the survey 
expectations to new developments, are not very plausible, 
however, owing to the long duration of the deviation.

This decline began well before the launch of 
the euro, however. The marked decrease in the 
long- term real interest rates from 6% in the 
early 1990s to figures between 2% and 3.5% 
in the first decade of EMU was accompanied 
by a halving of long- term growth expectations 
from 3% to around 1.5%. Furthermore, along 
with the increase in savings due to demo -
graphic change, the reduced level of uncer -
tainty since around the mid-1980s (caused by 
the “Great Moderation”) probably contributed 
to a decline in the risk premium and thus to 
falling real interest rates during this period.7
The acceleration of this decline in the wake of 
the financial and sovereign debt crisis is par -
ticularly pronounced in the euro area. Although 
the long- term prospects for growth on the two 
sides of the Atlantic did not veer apart mark -
edly, it is apparent that the real rates of interest 
have been diverging since 2013. Their excep -
tionally low figure in Germany is probably the 
consequence of a particular shortage of Ger -
man bonds brought about by the Eurosystem’s 
asset purchase programme, which lowers 
yields.
If an even longer period is to be covered, it is 
necessary – in the absence of survey data with 
a sufficiently long history – to approximate in -
flation expectations using a time series ap -proach. On the basis of a small number of as -
sumptions and only minor requirements re -
garding the available data, the approach ap -
plied by Hamilton et al (2016) is used here to 
derive inflation expectations from the actual 
inflation rate.8 The chart above shows real 
interest rates calculated in this way (and add -
itionally smoothed) using German and Euro -
pean data. For the period between 1960 and 
around 1990, these reveal a roughly stable 
long- term real interest rate at around 4%. Fol -
lowing German reunification, a steady down -
ward trend can be seen, as above, with par -
ticularly marked declines recorded around 
2009 as well as around 2016.
Irrespective of the method applied to calculate 
equilibrium interest rates from financial market 
data, it is evident that real yields in major cur -
rency areas are currently at an all- time low. 
However, the deviations over the past few 
years of the real interest rate variables from

that a cautious interpretation is called for, since 
risk assessments and liquidity can also push 
down real interest rates derived from financial 
market prices to a level below the neutral real 
interest rate as defined by Wicksell.
Quantification on the basis 
of assumptions about the 
relationship  between interest 
rates and output
While the approaches so far have used only 
interest rate and inflation data, numerous other 
approaches investigate the natural rate of inter -
est, together with other economically relevant 
variables, such as potential output or the nat -
ural rate of unemployment. These approaches 
encompass a large number of dynamic sto -
chastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, in 
which the natural rate of interest is defined as 
a short- term equilibrium real interest rate that 
appears in the model if prices and wages are 
fully flexible.9 This means, for example, that any 
impact of monetary policy on the natural rate 
of interest is, by definition, ruled out. Since, ac -
cording to this definition of the natural rate of 
interest used in DSGE models, numerous add -
itional unexpected developments in the real 
economy and on the financial market can 
nevertheless shift the natural rate of interest in 
one direction or the other, the natural rate of 
interest calculated in this manner is, as a rule, 
very volatile. With regard to the aforemen -
tioned time dimension, it is therefore assumed 
that a multitude of more short- term fluctu -
ations are also reflected in the natural rate of 
interest calculated in this way.
Aside from DSGE models, this quantification 
method also includes vector autoregressive 
time series models, such as those used by Lubik 
and Matthes (2015) and Kiley (2015).10 In these, 
data on interest rates and output are estimated 
jointly under certain assumptions. One very 
prominent example is the method of Laubach 
and Williams (2003), which has now been used for a large number of countries (see the box on 
page 33 et seq).11
Quantification on the basis of 
returns on capital
Notwithstanding all the differences between 
the various approaches, the estimates have 
nonetheless so far presented a clear picture: 
The natural rate of interest determined on the 
basis of default- free securities appears to have 
fallen since the 1980s or later across all the ob -
served time horizons and irrespective of the 
method used, with the lowest point being 
found either around 2009 (ie at the height of 
the financial crisis) or, depending on the model, 
in the recent past. Differences in the time per -
spective appear to impact solely on the abso -
lute level of the natural rate of interest and its 
volatility.
So far, however, the risk dimension has been 
left aside – in the literature on the natural inter -
est rate it has become common to use govern -
ment bond yields as a yardstick and thus, as a 
general rule, securities which have a low risk of 
default and high liquidity. This seems both Approaches 
using risk- free bond yields with potential growth estimates also indicate a downward trendMixed trends in risk- prone returns on capital

Estimating a medium- term equilibrium interest rate for the 
euro area using the Holston, Laubach and Williams (2017) approach
The broad decline in interest rates observed 
in recent years raises the question of 
whether this is merely a temporary phe-nomenon – that is, mainly a refl  ection of 
the crisis and the accommodative monetary 
policy response that will go into reverse once conditions return to normal  – or whether the downward movement is, in fact, an indication of profound structural change, suggesting that low interest rates 
are here to stay. Any attempt to answer this 
question would therefore need to investi-
gate empirically whether the observed path 
of interest rates should be interpreted pri-marily as a response to transitory cyclical fl  uctuations, or whether rates are instead being driven by factors which are shifting the long- term steady state of the macro-economy and which change over time at no more than a glacial pace.
1 Evidence of 
the latter would suggest that the “natural 
rate of interest” – that is, the interest rate 
that would prevail once all cyclical fl  uctu-
ations have subsided – has fallen.
One method based on this idea of deter-
mining the natural rate of interest empiric-
ally, and which has been discussed by lead-ing central bankers of late,
2 is the approach 
formulated by Holston, Laubach and Wil-
liams.3 This approach is based on a theoret-
ical standard model which describes eco-
nomic and infl  ation dynamics by means of 
two functions. The fi  rst is an aggregate de-
mand function – in other words, the rela-tionship between the output gap (ie the difference between actual and potential output) and the interest rate gap –  the second, a Phillips curve – that is, the rela-tionship between infl  ation and the output 
gap. For the purposes of this approach, the 
interest rate gap is the difference between 
the short- term ex ante real interest rate and 
the unobserved natural rate of interest: if these two rates are identical, the output 
gap can be said to be closed and infl  ation 
remains static. Specifi  cally, where the infl  a-
tion expectations of economic agents are assumed to be adaptive, that is to say, 
backward- looking, these two equations will be as follows:

In this model, the natural rate of interest, 
based on classical growth theory, is sensi-
tive to the rate of (trend) growth in poten-tial output, g
t, and also to a number of eco-
nomically unobservable variables (dubbed “headwinds” in the literature), which are 
collated to form a single variable that is as-
sumed to be highly persistent, namely zt, 
and which infl  uence the correlation be-
tween output and the interest gap over an 
extended period of time.6 Both the rate of 
trend growth and the headwinds variable 
are confi  gured as unit root processes – that 
is to say, the following holds true for the 
natural rate of interest:

in any case offer a medium to longer- term perspective.

The adjacent chart shows which path the natural rate of interest for the euro area –  derived from the model estimations of Holston, Laubach and Williams  – has fol-lowed since 1972.
8 It is evident from the 
chart that the natural rate of interest has experienced a trend decline over the past three decades. An extended spell at be-
tween 2% and 3% at the beginning of the observation period gave way to a four- year 
downward trend beginning in 1982 to 
somewhere in the region of 1%. After that, 
the natural rate of interest recovered until 1990 and then fl  uctuated around the 2%

Euribor rate less the four- quarter moving average of 
past infl  ation as a proxy for infl  ation expectations. For 
more detailed information on the data sources, see 
also footnote 8.
5 To prevent short- term fl  uctuations in both aggregate demand and infl  ation dynamics from being captured in 
the computed natural rate of interest, transitory ex-ogenous shocks are accounted for in the aggregate 
demand and supply function.
6 Classical growth theory states that the long- term 
equilibrium rate of interest is computed as r = 1–�gc + 
�, where �  denotes the intertemporal elasticity of 
substitution in consumption, gc the growth rate of pro 
capita consumption, and � the rate of households’ 
time preference.

that it refers to the level of real interest rates expected to prevail, say, fi  ve to ten years in the future, after the 
economy has emerged from any cyclical fl  uctuations and is expanding at its trend rate.” From T Laubach 
and J C Williams (2016), Measuring the natural rate of 
interest redux, Business Economics 41, pp 57-67. This 
inferred horizon also matches inter alia the fi  ve- year, fi  ve- year- forward interest rate expectations derived from a term structure model, the level and path of 
which correlate quite distinctly with the natural rate of 
interest estimated here. See Deutsche Bundesbank,

mark. The impact of the fi  nancial and eco-
nomic crisis sent it from roughly 2% to 
barely above zero within the space of just a 
year. Recovering briefl  y between 2010 and 
2012, the natural rate of interest continued 
its decline after the sovereign debt crisis set 
in, moving into negative territory in mid-
2013 and hitting a low of -0.5% at the be-
ginning of 2014. Since then, it returned to 
just above 0%, where it has remained since mid-2017.
The chart clearly shows that volatility in the 
natural rate of interest is being driven chiefl  y by the headwinds – the unobservable forces which the model cannot directly interpret in economic terms. Trend growth in potential 
output, on the other hand, remained very stable throughout the observation period up until the beginning of the 1990s, in a refl  ection of the modelling assumptions, 
before a gradual decline set in which accel-erated signifi  cantly as the fi  nancial and eco-nomic crisis took hold. The annualised rate 
of trend growth stood at 1.1% in the fi  rst 
half of 2017.
Overall, the results and the forces driving 
the natural rate of interest are fraught with 
a very high degree of estimation uncer-
tainty, however. Even minor tweaks to the 
technical assumptions made concerning the 
time series characteristics of the individual 
model variables, to the estimation method, or to the datasets used produce economic-ally signifi  cant changes in the level and path 
of the natural rate of interest.9 In essence, 
the results are so sensitive because of the multitude of unobserved variables. These 
include the natural rate of interest with its 
two components – the rate of trend growth 
and the headwinds – as well as potential 
output itself. The paths these variables fol-
low depend in part on identifying and sep-
arating transitory and permanent shocks, which can vary substantially for even the 
smallest changes in parameters.10At the same time, the path of the natural rate of interest is driven directly by the model as-
sumptions. Above all, the assumption con-cerning backward- looking infl  ation expect-
ations in the Phillips curve leads to a high rate 
of variability in the natural rate of interest 
during spells of substantial infl  ation volatility. As a case in point, the period of disinfl  ation in 
the 1980s shows that the model can only provide a suffi   ciently robust explanation of the path of infl  ation given a backward- 
looking formation of expectations if it is ac-
companied by a falling and negative output 
gap. At a given real rate of interest, this would automatically imply a falling natural 
rate of interest in the model used here, which materialises, in turn, in a decline in the unob-servable variables. Furthermore, the negative output gap observed during these years con-trasts in part with other frequently used stat-istical fi  ltering techniques such as the Hodrick- 
Prescott fi  lter used to determine potential 
output and thus also the output gap.
Having gained prominence in both aca-demic circles and the economic policy de-bate, the model outlined in this box has 
been extended and modifi  ed along various 
dimensions. Modifi  cations include adjust-ments to the assumed time series charac-teristics of the factors driving the natural rate of interest, and to the estimation 
method, which can impact on the level and volatility of the natural rate of interest.

understandable and reasonable if the natural 
rate of interest is to be regarded as a reference 
point for the key interest rate to be chosen by 
the central bank, the most immediate impact 
of which is on money market rates, which are 
likewise deemed very safe. This means that the 
natural rate of interest and (the inflation-  
adjusted) key interest rate are compared in a 
manner that is equivalent in terms of risk. At 
the same time, however, monetary policymak -
ers should not focus exclusively on a secure 
interest rate. Precisely in view of their relevance 
to inflationary pressure due to the real econ -
omy, it is also sensible not to lose sight com -
pletely of interest rates at further stages of the 
monetary policy transmission process. In this 
respect, differing measures for returns on cap -
ital are an appropriate indicator.
A study of various measures of returns on cap -
ital reveals a slower decline for returns on bor -
rowed funds, especially in the case of corpor -
ate bonds with a high credit rating, but no de -cline in the given various measures of the re -
turn on capital and the return on equity (see 
the box on page 37 et seq).
Assessment
For various reasons, the natural rate of interest 
has been attracting greater interest of late. For 
monetary policymakers, the natural interest 
rate is in many cases a key concept for gauging 
the degree of expansion of their monetary pol -
icy. To this end, a reliable and robust analysis of 
the causes of the level of and change in the 
natural rate of interest is required. Surveying 
selected methods of determining the natural 
rate of interest shows, however, that quantified 
conclusions about the level of this variable are 
subject to considerable uncertainty. Above and 
beyond the customary model uncertainties, dif -
ferences are also due to differing concepts of 
the natural interest rate: In particular, the time 
dimension, that is to say short- term equilibrium Return on bor-
rowed capital on downward trajectory, while return on total capital displays a slightly 
upward trend
Need to deter-
mine causes before making an assessmenttensions based on the above model have 
added variables to the description of the 
path followed by the natural rate of interest 
and the output gap, including variables 
which relate to the fi  nancial cycle, the risk 
appetite of fi  nancial market agents, and a 
possible binding lower bound, and can like-wise have a bearing on the path of the nat-
ural rate of interest.12 Finally, the model 
framework presented here for estimating 
the natural rate of interest is closely linked 
to trend/ cycle models, and to dynamic sto-
chastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models 
which can likewise assist in identifying and 
visualising the (medium- term) path of the 
natural rate of interest.13 The overall verdict 
of the different analyses is that the natural 
rate of interest has experienced a trend de-
cline, though the different approaches dis-
agree as to its level and volatility. This holds 
true for the euro area as well as for other 
currency areas like the United States. Note, 
however, that results are always fraught with a high degree of estimation uncer-
tainty.

Developments in the real return on capital in Germany
Measuring the real return on capital – the 
ratio of earnings to capital input – requires 
a number of assumptions about the group 
of entities under observation as well as a 
defi  nition of both earnings and capital. Since each of these assumptions can be subjected to critical scrutiny, the present 
text pursues an approach which is as broad as possible in order to obtain a robust out-
come. In line with the thrust of the main 
text, this is less a matter of a precise deter-mination of the level of the return on cap-ital than of its trend over time. For this pur-
pose, six approaches are explored below, 
sorted by the type of capital ranging from 
borrowed capital and total capital to equity capital.
1
Effective interest rates on bank loans to non- fi  nancial corporations
In view of the fact that enterprises in the 
corporate sector in Germany and the euro 
area are predominantly fi  nanced by loans 
from the banking sector,2 lending rates are 
an obvious metric.3 The chart on the left 
below shows the interest rate for bank loans to non- fi  nancial corporations, which 
account for nearly two- thirds of gross value added in Germany, adjusted for infl  ation ex-
pectations over comparable maturities and 
on a 12-month average, broken down by original maturity. There are two distinct 
phases of the decline in interest rates, from 2009 to 2012 and from 2015 onwards.
Returns on corporate bonds
Along with bank loans, corporate bonds 
represent the most important form of debt 
fi  nancing. The chart on the right below 
documents the remuneration of German 
corporate bonds over the past 60 years ad-justed for autoregressive estimated infl  ation expectations over a medium- term maturity. The chart at the top of the next page shows

nection – as a general rule, the return before tax on 
earnings is assumed as a basis.

European corporate bonds, broken down 
by class of risk. Here, too, it is apparent that 
there has been a declining  trend since the 
mid-1980s; yield spreads between sover-
eign and corporate bonds are stable or 
shrinking.
Net return on the aggregate capital 
stock
Besides the return on borrowed capital, it is 
possible to calculate various measures for 
the remuneration of total capital, which, in 
addition to borrowed funds, also includes equity capital. One possible broad defi  nition 
of the return on capital encompassing the 
economy as a whole would be the ratio of 
the share of net national income due to 
capital as a factor of production and the 
net capital stock, as used by the European 
Commission. The time series dating back to 
1960 for the countries considered here as 
well as the EU 15 show, amidst quite a large 
range of fl  uctuation, a general upward trend interrupted by recession- related troughs, including around the years 2009 
and 2013 (see the chart below).
Return on the productive capital of 
non- fi  nancial corporations
More specifi  cally tailored to the needs of 
enterprises and, in particular, their product-
ive capital are measures from the national 
accounts for the non- fi  nancial corporations 
sector. Here, it is possible to calculate the 
return on the entire productive capital using 
the ratio of the operating surplus to the 
productive capital stock, with the product-
ive capital stock being approximated across all fi  xed assets. Items suitable for use as nar-
rower measures of the productive capital 
stock are tangible fi  xed assets (all assets ex-Real return on outstanding

cluding intellectual property) as well as fi  xed 
assets excluding dwellings.
The operating surplus is the term used to 
describe the remuneration for all investors 
– equity and debt alike – and is therefore 
well suited to calculating the return on total assets.
4 Deducting interest payments to the 
creditors from this (and adding interest and 
dividends received) gives the corporate 
earnings and, with these, a measure of the 
return on capital geared to the equity pro-
viders.
As may be seen from the adjacent chart, all 
of the proposed measures of the return on 
total assets since 1991 show no declining 
trend. And even the sharp drop in risk- free 
interest rates and interest rates on corpor-
ate bonds in the wake of the fi  nancial crisis cannot be discerned for these measures. In 
the early 1990s, the level lies between 7% 
and 14%; two decades later, it is between 
14% and 21%, with signifi  cant declines in 
the years 1993, 2009 and 2013.
However, it is the average returns on capital 
which are shown; economic decisions do 
not, as a general rule, depend on the aver-
age return, but on the marginal return – in 
other words, the expected return on every 
additional euro invested. The average re-
turn is thus no more than a rough approxi-
mation of the marginal return,5 although 
the marginal return on capital for the pro-
ductive capital stock,6 which is also shown 
as a memo item, does not display a signifi  -
cantly different profi  le following a catching- 
up process from the mid-1990s onwards 
due to German reunifi  cation.
Return on total capital on the basis of 
annual fi  nancial statement data
The pool of data on the annual fi  nancial 
statements gives the Bundesbank access to information on the balance sheets and profi  t and loss accounts of more than 100,000 enterprises. Data extrapolated 
4 The operating surplus is essentially nominal output 
less intermediate consumption, depreciation, and 
compensation of employees – in other words, the re-
muneration of labour as a factor of production.5 Under the simplifying assumption of a Cobb- Douglas 
production function, the average return tracks the marginal return. Concerning the reasons for the two types of returns drifting apart, see J Poterba (1998), The rate of return to corporate capital and factor shares: new estimates using revised national income accounts and capital stock data, Carnegie- Rochester

from this cover over 90% of the turnover of 
the non- fi  nancial corporations sector. These 
data are extremely helpful not only owing to their breadth of coverage and the time period but also because they allow a sec-
toral breakdown for the purposes at hand. 
For internal consistency, when using this 
dataset the annual result before taxes on in-
come and, additionally, the annual result before taxes on income plus interest ex-penses and less interest earnings are used 
as the numerator for calculating the return 
on capital. As the denominator, tangible assets including intangible fi  xed assets are 
used along with non- fi  nancial assets, which additionally include inventories, and total assets, which also encompass fi  nancial 
assets.7 As in the case of national accounts 
data, in the adjacent chart it is possible to 
identify a moderately rising trend as well as two slumps in the years 2009 and 2013. In 
contrast to the national accounts data, however, the return levels are higher on 
average, although the defi  nitions of capital 
tend to be broader than in the measures 
based on national accounts metrics. For the 
best comparable measure – the annual re-
sult before taxes on income plus interest ex-
penses less interest earnings as a percent-
age of tangible and intangible fi  xed assets 
from the annual accounts data pool, as well as, from the national accounts, the operat-
ing surplus as a percentage of all assets – 
the return levels based on the annual fi  nan-
cial accounts data are more than twice as high. This is probably due, among other things, to incomplete coverage of all the economic sectors in the annual accounts 
data pool, as well as differences in the re-
spective accounting rules.
Earnings yield of German DAX 30 
companies 
Finally, for listed enterprises the earnings yield can be calculated as the ratio of the expected profi  ts 12 months ahead to the 
market value of the enterprises. In contrast to the previous measures, this rate of return is forward- looking and thus provides a basis 
for deciding on a possible, marginal add-
itional investment. On the other hand, the 
earnings yield captures only equity capital. 
As shown by the chart on page  41, the earnings yield displays no clear- cut trend 
and fl  uctuates between 4% and 11%, with 
identifi  able signifi  cant declines in the wake

of the 2009 fi  nancial crisis and the 2013 
European sovereign debt crisis. By contrast, 
the equity risk premium, ie the excess re-
turn that investors expect with given divi-
dend expectations and given a risk- free al-
ternative vehicle for the risk of an equity investment, shows a trend rise over the available period. This does not necessarily 
mean that shares have become more risky 
or less attractive but perhaps only that se-
cure forms of investment have become 
harder to come by.8
Conclusion
It is apparent that, in the wake of declining 
government bond yields, bank lending rates for enterprises and bond yields of private is-
suers, especially those with a high credit 
rating, have also been declining more and 
more, too – as is entirely consistent with ar-
bitrage between government bonds and 
safe corporate bonds. Measures of the re-
turn on total capital and the return on 
equity, on the other hand, display no down-ward trend. This picture is also repeated for the United States, where the real return on 
capital – with the exception of troughs in 
2001 and 2009 – has been showing an al-
most continuous upward trend since the 
1990s.9 And even looking at the real return 
on capital over a period of 200 years does 
not necessarily imply that how it has de-
veloped over the past 30 years has ushered 
in a new, unprecedented era.10 From this 
perspective, there is much to suggest that a change in risk behaviour is the major factor behind the marked difference between the 
returns on borrowed funds and those on 
equity fi  nancing. Investors in equity capital 
as a volatile residual income class are not experiencing any sustained fall in returns, 
whereas the return on fi  xed interest income 
streams has declined noticeably.8 On the design and the identifi  cation of the earnings 
yield and the equity risk premium, see Deutsche Bun-

or medium to long- term equilibrium, and the 
inclusion of risk elements, do indeed result in 
very different assessments. From a monetary 
policy perspective, there are therefore some ar -
guments for not giving too much weight to the 
concept of a natural rate of interest and for re -
garding it instead as one of a large number of 
indicators relevant to monetary policy, while re -
maining aware of its limitations.
The natural rate of interest has recently been 
advanced as an indicator of a sustained dra -
matic deterioration in the long- term outlook 
for growth (secular stagnation theory). In the 
academic debate, four explanatory factors have 
emerged as possible causes of a secular down -
ward trend in the natural interest rate: a 
stronger propensity to save, a reduced inclin -
ation to invest, policy measures and, lastly, a 
change in risk aversion.
The finding presented in this article indicating 
an almost consistently high return on equity 
and total capital appears especially compatible 
with an explanation based more on a higher 
demand for less risky assets and less so with theories about an increased propensity to save 
or a reduced inclination to invest since, in prin -
ciple, both should be evident in the returns on 
borrowed capital as well as on equity capital.12 
Seen in that light, the finding given here does 
not corroborate the secular stagnation theory. 
Nevertheless, a study of the deeper- lying 
causes of a virtually constant return on equity 
with, at the same time, lower rates of interest 
on borrowed funds still merits further analyses.
Indications of 
demand for less risky assets as a key driver12 Many research papers also find that the risk factor plays 
a crucial role in the natural rate of interest. These papers 
include M T Kiley (2015), op cit; regarding the specific form 
of risk aversion in premiums on safe investments and high

The supervisory review and evaluation 
process  for smaller institutions and 
proportionality  considerations
The banking supervision framework in the European Union has been comprehensively changed, 
amongst other things by the implementation of Basel III and the launch of the banking union, 
with the aim of achieving a more resilient banking sector. Against this backdrop of increased 
regulation, the question arises as to whether certain regulatory requirements can be relaxed for 
smaller banks with straightforward business models without compromising the resilience of the 
banking sector as a whole. In this context, the principle of proportionality in banking supervision 
has increasingly featured in the public discourse. According to the principle of proportionality, 
both the application of prudential requirements and the design of internal risk measurement and 
management procedures should be commensurate with the business model, size and riskiness of 
each institution, and the significance of the institution for the entire banking system should be 
taken into account.
The proportionality principle is an important element of the supervisory framework, as diversified 
and decentralised structures such as those in the German banking market, with its more than 
1,600 credit institutions, require differentiated rules and supervisory practices. This allows both for 
a better risk orientation, ie determining the focus of supervision in relation to an institution’s risk, 
and for the efficient supervision of market participants.
As part of the ongoing supervision of credit institutions, the proportionality principle has thus far 
mainly been applied in assessing the adequacy of the internal risk measurement and manage -
ment procedures (Pillar 2 of the Basel framework). This article looks mainly at how the Bundes -
bank and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) anchor concepts of proportionality 
in their supervisory activities. This concerns, in particular, the implementation of the European 
Banking Authority (EBA) Guidelines on the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP). Fur -

future are discussed under the heading “small banking box”.Deutsche Bundesbank

Proportionality in banking 
supervision
The prudential supervision of large, internation -
ally active banks is based on a three- pillar con -
cept under the Basel framework. Pillar 1 con -
tains the regulatory minimum capital require -
ments for credit risk, market risk and oper -
ational risk, in accordance with the criteria 
prescribed by supervisors, as measured using 
the standardised approach or the internal 
model method. Pillar  2 covers internal risk 
measurement and management procedures 
and builds on the first pillar by including other 
material risks. The task of banking supervisors 
under Pillar 2 is to assess, as part of the SREP , 
whether a bank’s internal risk measurement 
and risk management system is adequate. This 
may also include supervisory interventions such 
as additional capital or liquidity requirements. 
Pillar  3 contains supervisory transparency re -
quirements, according to which banks must 
disclose key information on their risk situation, 
their capital and liquidity situation, and on risk 
measurement and management. This is de -
signed to enable other market participants and 
the general public to assess a bank’s risk situ -
ation, with the aim of strengthening market 
discipline.
Due to the increasing complexity of the finan -
cial system, this regulatory framework as a 
whole has also grown more complex. At the 
same time, in the EU these rules are being ap -
plied to all banks, not just to those that are 
internationally active. Against this backdrop, 
the principle of dual proportionality pursuant 
to Article 74 (2) and Article 97 (4) of the Capital 
Requirements Directive (CRD) is of key import -
ance. On the one hand, banks must implement 
internal risk measurement and management 
procedures that are proportionate to the inher -
ent complexity of their business activities and 
the associated risks. On the other hand, micro -
prudential supervisory activities should also 
have regard to the nature, scale and riskiness 
of a bank, as well as its systemic importance. 
While both components are closely inter -twined, this article focuses on the supervisory 
aspect of this dual proportionality. In the super -
visory framework, the principle of proportional -
ity is mainly applied in Pillar 2.
However, against the backdrop of a growing 
volume of prudential regulation, discussions 
are increasingly looking at what regulatory ap -
proaches could be used to more strongly an -
chor the principle of proportionality in the re -
quirements of Pillar 1 and/ or Pillar 3.
The supervisory review 
and evaluation process – 
an overview 
Under the SREP , an institution is subject to a 
comprehensive assessment. This involves an as -
sessment of the institution’s internal regula -
tions, strategies and processes, as well as an 
assessment of its risks and its capital and liquid -
ity resources. Ultimately, the aim is to deter -
mine whether sufficient risk coverage is assured 
for risks against which capital can be held and 
for liquidity risks through the presence of cor -
responding capital instruments and liquid 
assets, and whether an appropriate basis for 
future risk coverage is provided by adequate 
and effective risk management. The key elem -
ents here include the internal capital adequacy 
assessment process (ICAAP) and the internal 
liquidity  adequacy assessment process (ILAAP).
A key result of the SREP is the setting of the 
adequate capital level for each bank from a 
supervisory perspective, particularly in light of 
the risks entered into.
Harmonised European provisions for the SREP 
are found in the guidelines issued by the Euro -
pean Banking Authority (EBA/ GL/ 2014/ 13). Ac -
cording to these, the core of the supervisory 
tasks in Pillar 2 is the business model analysis as 
well as the assessment of internal governance 
and the risks to capital and liquidity of an insti -
tution or group of institutions. The guidelines 
have been applicable since January 2016. The SREP: compre-

processes relating to the supervision of less sig -
nificant credit institutions – which in Germany 
fall under the responsibility of BaFin and the 
Bundesbank – have been adjusted and/ or sup -
plemented on the basis of these guidelines. For 
example, a greater focus is now placed on the 
business model analysis. However, the most 
significant change for institutions concerns the 
supervisory measures that are set on the basis 
of the SREP . In contrast to the supervisory ap -
proach used in Germany until 2015, these 
measures now include a mandatory setting of a 
capital add- on for risks that are not covered by 
the Pillar 1 capital requirements. The aim of the 
German supervisory authorities is to uphold the 
principle of proportionality and ensure that an 
individual institution’s circumstances are ad -
equately taken into account. As the ICAAP of 
each institution is itself a key element of the 
SREP , proportionality is already taken into ac -
count up to a certain point. In addition, the ap -
proach presented in this article and practised in 
Germany has the clear advantage that the 
ICAAP can continue to be the main instrument 
for internal governance.
Institution- specific risk 
profiles  – a key element of 
ongoing supervision
Under the SREP , the Bundesbank, in consult -
ation with BaFin, draws up an institution-  
specific risk profile, which serves as a central 
supervisory analysis and assessment tool. This 
includes an overall assessment of the respective 
institution in light of all risk- relevant factors 
known to supervisors. A key information source 
is the audit report for the annual accounts. 
Additional supervisory information is also in -
corporated, for example from discussions with 
senior management, surveys and requests for 
information, and on- site inspections. The struc -
ture of the risk profile is based, in particular, on 
the EBA’s SREP guidelines. Accordingly, four as -
sessment areas are defined for supervisors: the 
business model analysis, the assessment of in -ternal governance, the capital adequacy assess -
ment and the liquidity adequacy assessment.
Taking into account the business and capital 
planning of an institution, the business model 
analysis focuses on viability (12-month perspec -
tive) and sustainability (3-year perspective). In 
addition to internal factors (including owner -
ship and corporate structure, profitability, stra -
tegic orientation and planning assumptions), 
the analysis also incorporates external factors 
(such as the macroeconomic environment and 
the competitive landscape). This results in a 
holistic and forward- looking analysis of the 
business model from both a quantitative and 
qualitative perspective, with the supervisory au -
thorities taking a neutral stance towards the 
specifics of the business model.
The internal governance element involves as -
sessing the adequacy of corporate governance 
and internal capital adequacy management. 
This is based, in particular, on the requirements 
for a proper business organisation pursuant to 
Section 25a of the German Banking Act (Kredit -
wesengesetz)  in conjunction with the Minimum 
requirements for risk management ( Mindest -
anforderungen an das Risikomanagement  – 
MaRisk). In this context, for example, super -
visors assess the adequacy of the internal con -
trol system, the compliance and risk control 
function, internal audit, and compliance with 
reporting and disclosure requirements. In the 
area of internal capital adequacy management, 
an assessment is made of the ICAAP’s scope of 
application and methodology, as well as of re -
porting and the review of internal capital ad -
equacy management.
The risks to capital are broken down into credit 
and counterparty risk, equity risk, interest rate 
risk in the banking book, other market risk, op -
erational risk and other material risks. For the 
risks to liquidity, both short- term liquidity risk as 
well as medium to long- term funding risk are 
considered. In each case, supervisors assess 
both the level of risk and the adequacy and ef -Risk profile as a

fectiveness of the procedures for managing 
and monitoring these risks.
The risk assessment is conducted in line with 
the principle of materiality. For instance, in the 
case of small credit institutions that conduct 
only traditional deposit- taking business, there is 
generally no need to assess other market risks. 
In addition, the depth of both the analysis and 
the assessment of the risk profile hinges on the 
principle of proportionality; in other words, it is 
much more intense for large, complex institu -
tions with a high degree of risk than for smaller 
or low- risk institutions.
A score of 1 (no/ very low risk; strong risk man -
agement) to 4 (high risk; weak risk manage -
ment) is given for each of these four assess -
ment areas and any additional sub- areas.
As well as presenting the above- mentioned 
institution- specific factors (quality dimension), 
the final, overall assessment also reflects the 
importance of the institution for the entire 
banking system (systemic dimension).
The key idea behind the overall score for the 
risk profile in terms of the quality dimension is 
the risk of an institution’s status as a going 
concern being jeopardised, taking into account 
the analyses and the scores for the four above- 
mentioned areas. As well as a verbal assess -
ment, a score from 1 to 4 is given.1 In addition 
to this quality dimension, the institutions are 
placed into categories (I- IV) according to their 
impact on the stability of the banking system as 
a whole, which essentially depends on the size 
of their balance sheet and the type of business 
activities they conduct. Category I is assigned 
where the impact of a default on financial sta -
bility is deemed to be low, and category IV 
where it is deemed to be high. On the basis of 
these two dimensions, a final risk classification 
is made for each institution in a 4x4 matrix.
The overall assessment, which reflects the as -
sessment of the quality of the institution and its 
impact on the stability of the banking system, then forms the basis for the annual operational 
supervisory plans and for deciding on supervis -
ory actions, such as the frequency and scope of 
discussions with senior management.
SREP capital determination
The main change to previous supervisory prac -
tice arising from the implementation of the 
EBA’s SREP guidelines in Germany is the man -
datory setting of an institution- specific capital 
add- on pursuant to Section 10 (3) of the Ger -
man Banking Act. The first component of this is 
the SREP capital add- on (Pillar 2 requirement, 
or P2R). This is intended, in particular, to cover 
those risks which are not covered, or are not 
sufficiently covered, by the Pillar 1 capital re -
quirements (8% of risk- weighted assets).
The institution’s ICAAP figures serve as the 
basis for determining the SREP capital add- on, 
whereby the Pillar  1 requirements –  as min -
imum requirements  – form the lower bound 
for each risk type (“Pillar 1 plus approach”). In 
addition, as was previously the case, qualitative 
shortcomings or model weaknesses can be 
taken into account when determining the cap -
ital add- on. Regulatory capital must be held 
against the resulting capital add- on; this must 
comply with the Pillar  1 structural require -
ments. This means that at least 56% of it must 
be Common Equity Tier 1 capital and at least 
75% Tier 1 capital.Materiality and

1 This has consequences for the subsequent supervisory 
activities. For example, the overall score of 4 for the risk 
profile not only results in a significant intensification of 
supervision – typically by way of an initial sharp increase in 
requirements to provide information, which is then used as 
a basis for further supervisory measures – but also in the 
institution’s classification as a problem institution in accord -
ance with Section 2.2.4 of the Prudential Supervisory 
Guideline (see Guideline on the implementation of and 
quality assurance for the ongoing monitoring of credit in -
stitutions and financial services institutions by the Deutsche 
Bundesbank of 19 December 2016 (Richtlinie zur Durchfüh -
rung und Qualitätssicherung der laufenden Überwachung 
der Kredit- und Finanzdienstleistungsinstitute durch die 
Deutsche Bundesbank vom 19. Dezember 2016)).Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
October 2017

Of the risks factored into the SREP capital add- 
on, the most prominent and, in quantitative 
terms, the greatest risk is interest rate risk in 
the banking book. “Other material risks” in -
clude, for example, credit spread risk in the 
banking book, ie the risk that the creditworthi -
ness of a borrower worsens and thus leads to 
write-  downs or hidden losses. In addition, 
funding risk, ie the risk that it will only be pos -
sible to fund assets at higher costs, is also taken 
into account.
The second component is Pillar 2 capital guid -
ance (P2G), which expands the concept of the 
capital conservation buffer. P2G is intended to 
ensure that the capitalisation of a given institu -
tion is so good that the entire minimum capital 
requirement under Pillar 1 and P2R can be met 
even in stress periods. P2G is determined on 
the basis of institution- specific stress test re -
sults. As such considerations also played a role, 
at least implicitly, in the calibration of the cap -
ital conservation buffer, P2G vies with the rele -
vant Pillar 1 requirements. As a consequence, 
capital only need be held against the maximum 
of the corresponding Pillar 1 buffer and P2G. It 
should be noted that Common Equity Tier 1 
capital always has to be held against the capital 
conservation buffer. By contrast, regulatory 
own funds and reserves pursuant to Section 
340 f of the German Commercial Code (Han-
delsgesetzbuch)  can be held against the por -
tion of P2G that exceeds the capital conserva -
tion buffer.
In Germany, P2G is determined using the re -
sults of the supervisory stress test underpinning 
the 2015, and in future 2017, surveys on the 
low- interest- rate environment (for a summary 
of the 2017 low- interest- rate survey, see the 
box on pages 52 and 53).
The SREP capital add- on is a Pillar 2 capital re -
quirement that must be met at all times. If the 
Pillar  2 capital requirement is undershot, the 
supervisory authorities can take measures pur -
suant to Section 45 of the German Banking Act 
to improve the institution’s capital base. P2G, by contrast, is an expectation on the part of 
supervisors. It is a reference figure and early 
warning threshold, and the capital held to 
meet it can be used to absorb losses in times of 
stress. Unlike in the case of the Pillar 2 capital 
requirement, if P2G is undershot, this does not 
automatically trigger supervisory measures, but 
it does automatically lead to an increase in the 
intensity of supervision and normally to a re -
quirement to draw up a capital plan.
In order to implement the EBA requirements, 
credit institutions pursuant to Section 1 (1) of 
the German Banking Act, which fall under the 
direct supervision of the Bundesbank and 
BaFin, underwent (or will undergo) their first 
capital determination in 2016 and 2017. In 
2016, an SREP capital add- on was initially de -
termined for 303 credit institutions. A general 
administrative act required the remaining credit 
institutions to hold capital against interest rate 
risk in the banking book above and beyond the 
capital requirements set out in the Capital Re -
quirements Regulation (CRR). These institu -
tions, too, will now undergo an SREP capital 
determination in the course of 2017. The intro -
duction of the SREP capital determination over 
a two- year period allows for the roughly 1,600 
affected credit institutions to be properly pro -
cessed. According to the EBA guidelines, the 
SREP capital determination must be reviewed 
at least every three years (for a brief description 
of the methodology, see the box on pages 49 
and 50).
Based on the provisional figures for 2017,2 the 
average SREP capital add- on works out at 
1.4 percentage points, which equates to a total 
of €18 billion. By comparison, the SREP capital 
add- on for significant institutions in the Single 
Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) averaged 2 per -… for interest

centage points in 2016.3 For the less significant 
institutions, interest rate risk in the banking 
book accounts for an average of 1 percentage 
point and other material risks account for 
0.4 percentage point. The fact that interest rate 
risk accounts for such a large percentage of the 
SREP capital add-  on underscores the import -
ance of this type of risk for German credit insti -
tutions. At institution level, however, there are, 
in some cases, considerable differences in 
terms of risk exposure in these two areas. On 
balance, the bandwidth of the SREP capital 
add- ons ranges from 0 to 11 percentage points.
The size of the capital add-  on is determined 
solely on the basis of the amount of risks that 
are not or not sufficiently covered by Pillar 1 
capital requirements. Actual capitalisation, by 
contrast, has no role to play in determining the 
capital add- on. Thus, well- capitalised credit in -
stitutions, too, may receive a high SREP capital 
add- on if they have a large percentage of risks 
that are not covered by Pillar 1. For most insti -tutions, the size of the capital add- on therefore 
says little about supervisors’ assessment of the 
overall risk profile. Only in the overall assess -
ment is capitalisation, amongst other factors, 
taken into account.
A comparison of institution- specific capital re -
quirements and actual capital levels (see the 
chart on page 51) shows that the vast majority 
of credit institutions have sufficient regulatory 
own funds to satisfy the additional SREP capital 
add- on, with the capital ratio averaging around 
20%. There is a shortfall in only a few cases.

National methodology for setting SREP capital requirements
In line with the European Banking Authority 
(EBA) Guidelines, the SREP capital determin-
ation consists of two components (see the 
chart below): the risk portion (Pillar 2 cap-
ital requirement) and the stress portion 
(Pillar  2 capital guidance). Both components 
are calculated as an add- on in relation to 
the institution’s total risk exposure amount 
(TREA) pursuant to the Capital Require-
ments Regulation (CRR).
The Pillar 2 capital requirement comprises 
three add- ons: add- on for interest rate risk 
in the banking book (IRRBB), add- on for 
other material risks, and an individual add- 
on if applicable.
The calculation of the IRRBB add- on is based on the negative change in present value as a result of the Basel interest rate shock (parallel shift of the yield curve by ±200 basis points). This is expressed as a 
proportion of the TREA. On the basis of the ratio calculated and the quality of risk man-
agement, which is determined using the qualitative individual risk profi  le score for IRRBB, IRRBB is allocated to one of 16 buckets. The relevant capital add- on can be 
determined from the upper add- on matrix 
on page  50.  It should be noted that, on 
average, the add- on covers only about half1 
of the negative change in present value as a result of the Basel interest rate shock.
Other material risks which cannot be allo-
cated to either Pillar 1 or IRRBB are factored in by way of a separate add- on. This is done by using data from the reports pursuant to the Financial and Internal Capital Adequacy 
Information Regulation (Verordnung zur Einreichung von Finanz- und Risikotrag-
fähigkeitsinformationen), which institutions have been submitting since 2015. This yields non- Pillar 1 risks expressed as the difference 
between total risk (excluding inter- risk di-versifi  cation effects) and Pillar  1 risks (in-cluding IRRBB). The difference between 
total risk and Pillar 1 risks (including IRRBB) 
1 The concept uses half of the negative change in 
present value to take into account the argument that 
the Basel interest rate shock framework also contains a 
strong stress component. The SREP merely envisages an interest rate shock of approximately 100 basis 
points in the Pillar 2 capital requirement.

equates to non- Pillar 1 risks and is expressed 
as a proportion of total risk. By constructing 
the metric in this way, certain institution- specifi  c differences in risk measurement, particularly different confi  dence levels or different risk defi  nitions, can be balanced out and the ICAAP results brought to a 
comparable level for the SREP . As an estima-
tor of the importance of non- Pillar 1 risks, 
this metric forms the material basis for the 
add- on for other material risks. In addition 
to the ratio of non- Pillar 1 risks to total risk, the calculation of the capital add- on also in-
corporates the quality of risk management 
by means of the individual risk profi  le scores 
for ICAAP and internal governance. The 
worse of the two individual scores is used. 
Depending on how the two criteria shape up (risk level and quality of risk manage-ment), the relevant institution is allocated to one of 16 buckets, from which, in turn, a 
specifi  c capital add- on is derived. The 
institution- specifi  c capital add- on is thus de-termined from the adjacent add- on matrix.
In addition, an individual capital add- on can 
be considered on a case- by- case basis in 
order to address aspects not covered by the 
two other components. These include, for 
example, defi  ciencies in internal govern-
ance.Pillar 2 capital guidance is derived from the 
result of the supervisory stress test for the 
2017 survey on the low- interest- rate envir-
onment. As for the Pillar 2 capital require-
ment, the approach taken here entails using 
different buckets to determine the 
institution- specifi  c requirement. The alloca-
tion to the relevant bucket is based on the 
institution- specifi  c stress effect.Add-on matrix

last year. For instance, the change in present 
value as a result of the Basel interest rate shock 
(parallel shift of the yield curve by ± 200 basis 
points) has declined considerably since 2016 at 
a significant number of institutions. To what 
extent this can be attributed to an optimised 
methodology, for example targeted parameter 
adjustments for positions with indefinite capital 
tie- up or the recognition of pension liabilities, 
or to a genuine change in financial circum -
stances, for example through hedging transac -
tions or restructuring of proprietary invest -
ments, will have to be examined on a case- by- 
case basis. In addition, a number of institutions 
have, for internal capital adequacy reporting, 
started to report their risks in aggregate form 
only or not to recognise certain risks at all. 
Such adjustments raise questions about the 
quality of internal risk management proced -
ures. The Bundesbank and BaFin will, therefore, 
keep a critical eye on any adjustments that re -
sult in a material change in risk exposure and 
thus the level of capital add- ons.
Foreseeable developments
Based on the results of the 2017 low- interest-  
rate survey and the phasing- in of the capital 
conservation buffer, the procedure for deter -
mining Pillar 2 capital guidance will be adjusted 
slightly. First, buckets will be redefined. In par -
ticular, this will take into account the fact that, 
by 2019, the capital conservation buffer of 
2.5  percentage points will have been intro -
duced in full, eliminating the need for a differ -
entiated analysis of Pillar  2 capital guidance 
below this rate. Second, the size of the respect -
ive Pillar 2 capital guidance will now be linked 
more directly to the level of stress effects. This 
is possible because banks were informed ahead 
of the stress test that the results would be used 
to determine Pillar  2 capital guidance. This 
transparent approach also allowed data quality 
to be improved. In the case of an institution 
with nominally comparable stress effects in the 
2015 and 2017 low- interest- rate surveys, the 
modified procedure will tend to result in higher Pillar  2 capital guidance. Overall, the institu -
tions will – with just a few exceptions – have 
enough capital to cover this additional stress 
buffer. This will represent a challenge for only a 
small number of institutions.
In addition, German banks’ capital adequacy 
concepts need adjusting because capital add-  
ons will be set regularly going forward. This is 
most relevant for institutions where govern -
ance is primarily designed to meet regulatory 
own funds requirements (known as “going 
concern” approaches).4 Under these ap -
proaches, the only capital available as risk cov -
erage potential is capital that is not needed to 
meet regulatory capital requirements. As cap -
ital add- ons increase regulatory capital require -
ments, their room for manoeuvre in terms of 
available risk coverage potential narrows so 
much, in some cases, as to render meaningful 
governance impossible. The institutions in par -
ticular were therefore keen that the supervisory 
framework for the ICAAP be adapted to the

Stress tests as part of the 2017 low- interest- rate survey
Content of the survey
Following two surveys in 2013 and 2015, 
the Bundesbank and the Federal Financial 
Supervisory Authority this year conducted a 
third survey among 1,555 small and medium- sized German credit institutions 
that are directly overseen by national super-
visors on their profi  tability and resilience in 
the low- interest- rate environment. The aim of the survey is to gain a comprehensive in-
sight into the profi  t outlook of German 
credit institutions and to identify at an early stage potential risks that might arise, above all, in a scenario of persistently low interest 
rates. The survey results will be taken into 
account in future supervisory activities.
Supervisory stress tests were again part of 
the survey, which covered interest rate risks, credit risks, and market risks. The aim here was to test the credit institutions’ resilience 
in a status quo scenario, taking into ac-count additional stress factors such as an 
abrupt hike in interest rates, an increase in 
the number of defaults in the credit port-folio, as well as a sudden rise in credit spreads or falling asset prices (see the chart 
below). The individual results from the 
stress tests are used to determine supervis-
ory Pillar  2 capital guidance and thereby 
help to improve the stability of the German banking market even further.
Results
Over a one- year stress horizon, the aggre-
gate Common Equity Tier  1 capital ratio 
falls by just under 3  percentage points, from the most recent value of 16.24% to 
13.29% at the end of 2017. The main drivers 
are value effects of interest- bearing pos-itions resulting from rising interest rates and/ or credit spreads. In a stress scenario, 
any available hidden reserves could also be liquidated to increase earnings and thereby 
mitigate the stress effect. Particularly vul-
nerable institutions are now subject to even more intensive supervision.
The stress test on interest rate risk shows that an abrupt interest rate hike of 2 per-
centage points would be passed on mainly on the assets side – ie in the form of rising

quirements in terms of the ICAAP for significant 
institutions must also be incorporated.5 New 
guidelines on the supervisory assessment of 
banks’ internal capital adequacy concepts are 
therefore currently being developed.6 This in -
volves regular consultations with representa -
tives of the banking associations. The guide -
lines are to be finalised at the end of this year.
The draft guidelines are based on principles, 
with particular emphasis on observing the prin -
ciple of proportionality. As before, responsibility 
for designing and implementing the ICAAP lies 
with the institutions themselves. The ICAAP is 
to retain its central role in banks’ internal pro -
cesses and in supervision, as ICAAP results are 
to remain the starting point for determining 
capital add- ons in the SREP .
Overall, the German supervisory authorities are 
well equipped with the current design of the 
SREP for less significant institutions. The provi -
sions of the EBA guidelines have been imple -mented. A uniform methodology is used to de -
termine prudential capital requirements for all 
institutions, ensuring a comparable and con -
sistent approach and involving no additional 
operational burden for banks. At the same 
time, adequate account is taken of banks’ par -
ticularities. Thanks to the now well- established 
internal capital adequacy reporting, the Bun -
desbank and BaFin have a systematically col -
lected, high- quality data base, which means 
that additional data collection is generally not 
necessary. As a result, the processes that have 
been developed are efficient, easy to standard -
ise and can be implemented in a risk- based 
manner. For the institutions, the method used 
to determine capital add- ons is clear and trans -
parent in BaFin’s decisions.
SREP well 
designed, but changes possibleinterest rates in lending – whereas interest 
on the liabilities side would increase to a 
much lesser extent. Nevertheless, due to 
the higher volume of interest- bearing liabil-ities, there is a slight fall in interest income in the short term. The stress effect is, how-ever, largely driven by valuation effects, es-
pecially from securities in the liquidity re-serve. These valuation effects account for around 60% of the stress effect arising 
from interest rate risk.
In the market risk stress test, approximately 
half of the stress effect was caused by value changes in interest- bearing positions. How-
ever, the valuation effects of non- interest- 
bearing positions make a disproportionately 
large contribution to the stress effect rela-
tive to their portfolio share of around 20%. 
Substantial losses from special funds and 
real estate funds are especially noteworthy 
in this regard.The credit risk stress test leads to a fall in the Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 0.83  percentage points. The main risk 
drivers in the credit risk stress test are loans to enterprises. These account for more than 
30% of the total stress effect. Although 
loans secured by residential property consti-tute a similarly high proportion of the port-folio, they lead to considerably lower write- downs due to higher collateralisation ratios.

Currently, the SSM is working on a harmonised 
SREP methodology for less significant institu -
tions.7 The Supervisory Board is scheduled to 
take a decision at the end of 2017.
Proportionality from a 
regulatory  perspective
In banking regulation, the principle of propor -
tionality means that the prudential require -
ments and their application must be propor -
tionate to the nature, scale and complexity of 
the risks associated with an institution’s busi -
ness model and activities.
Banking regulation already takes the principle 
of proportionality into account through the 
above- described gradations under Pillar 2. For 
instance, the CRR8 contains size- dependent 
gradations in reporting requirements and, 
when determining capital charges for market 
risk, differentiates between trading book and 
non- trading book institutions in terms of the 
level of requirements to be met. The principle 
of proportionality is also implicitly recognised in 
the fact that small institutions generally apply 
only the CRR’s simple standardised approaches, 
while entry barriers mean that model- based 
approaches are usually reserved for large insti -
tutions.
European banking regulation is based on the 
concept of the “single rulebook”, in other 
words one binding regulatory framework for all 
Member States. It follows the regulatory stand -
ards agreed at the international level by the 
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (here -
inafter referred to as the Basel Committee). At 
the European level, the Basel rules were imple -
mented in the CRR and CRD.9 They are thus 
directly applicable (CRR) or must be applied 
after national transposition (CRD) by all institu -
tions resident in the EU, irrespective of their 
size. This is intended to ensure a level playing 
field.The Basel Committee provisions were recently 
fundamentally revised in response to the finan -
cial crisis.10 This made the framework increas -
ingly complex. Since small and medium- sized 
institutions do not enjoy the same economies 
of scale as large institutions in terms of meet -
ing the heightened regulatory requirements, 
the increased complexity of the rules may be 
detrimental to the level playing field and create 
incentives for uniformity and size in the bank -
ing sector. Against this backdrop, there is in -
creasing debate on whether and how banking 
regulation could be made more “proportion -
ate” for small and less complex institutions, in 
particular.
Proportionality in the 
revision  of the CRR
On 23 November 2016, the European Commis -
sion presented a legislative proposal for the re -
vision of the CRR and CRD. This was motivated 
by the implementation of the provisions of the 
Basel Committee (particularly in relation to li -
quidity, the trading book and the leverage 
ratio). However, the Commission’s proposal 
also contains suggestions on how to render in -
dividual requirements in terms of reporting, dis -
closure and remuneration more proportionate. 
Under the Commission proposal, institutions 
whose average total assets over the last four 
years do not exceed an absolute threshold are 
to be granted relief in the above- mentioned 
areas. For reporting and disclosure require -
ments, it is proposing a threshold of €1.5 bil -
lion and for remuneration rules €5 billion (in 
combination with a criterion that depends on 
remuneration payments). As regards reporting 
requirements, the proposals aim primarily at re -
ducing reporting frequency. According to the Single rulebook

Commission’s proposal, institutions with limited 
trading book activities (less than 10% of total 
assets, subject to a maximum of €300 million) 
would, moreover, be eligible to use a simplified 
standardised approach to calculate regulatory 
own funds requirements for trading book 
transactions.
Initiative for a three- step 
approach  with a “small 
banking box”
In addition to the European Commission’s pro -
posals for specific relief in the context of the 
review of the CRR and CRD, there is also a Ger -
man initiative for even more proportionality in 
banking regulation. To this end, an expert 
working group has been created, including 
representatives of the German Ministry of Fi -
nance, BaFin, the Bundesbank and five associ -
ations representing the German banking sector. 
After the working group was set up and con -
sultations had taken place, a working paper 
was drawn up, which the Federal Ministry of 
Finance put before the competent expert group 
of the European Commission in June of this 
year. It is being used there as the basis for fur -
ther discussion at the European level. Specific -
ally, the proposal is as follows.
– The full Basel III requirements will continue 
to apply to institutions that are systemically 
important or potentially pose a systemic 
risk – in terms of numbers, this is the small -
est group, but it is very significant in terms 
of risk and therefore the most closely regu -
lated. This group will receive no relief under 
the CRR and CRD.
– A second group of institutions which are 
neither large nor systemically important, but 
equally neither small nor low-  risk, will re -
ceive some targeted relief, which can be 
achieved by adjusting individual points of 
the current rules.– The third group constitutes small and non-  
complex institutions. This group, which is 
numerically the largest, is to receive the 
most relief. The idea is to create a separate 
set of rules: the “small banking box”.
Creating a separate regulatory framework for 
small institutions is based on the idea that this 
can relieve such institutions of having to meet 
requirements that are not relevant to them 
more than can adjustments to the details of the 
existing regulatory framework. There is, more -
over, the danger that a lot of detailed exemp -
tions could ultimately make the rules less clear 
and more difficult to interpret. Creating a sep -
arate regulatory framework for small institu -
tions would, by contrast, increase the clarity of 
the framework.
In the future discussions on route to establish -
ing a “small banking box”, care must equally be 
taken to ensure that the reduced reporting and 
disclosure requirements do not lead to a reduc -
tion in overall regulatory requirements, in par -
ticular with regard to the relevant institutions’ 
capital and liquidity levels. In addition, when 
considering lowering reporting requirements, 
policymakers should not forget the information 
needed by other policy areas, such as monetary 
policy or macroprudential regulation. Ultim -
ately, creating a “small banking box” is in -
tended to achieve greater proportionality by 
eliminating requirements in terms of remuner -
ation rules, Pillar 3 disclosure requirements and 
recovery and resolution planning that are not 
necessary from a supervisory perspective and 
by rendering the supervisory reporting regime 
noticeably less onerous.
Exactly where the threshold for banks within 
the “small banking box” should be has yet to 
be established in discussions at the European 
level; in this process, the circle of institutions 
involved and the planned reporting relief can -
not be regarded in isolation. The German work -
ing paper proposes, by way of example, an ab -
solute threshold of total assets of €3 billion and 
an, as yet unspecified, relative threshold which A German 
initiative  for simpler  rules for 
small banksContents of the “small banking box”Deutsche Bundesbank

would be tied to the gross domestic product of 
the Member State in question or the size of its 
banking sector, whichever is the lower. The 
quantitative threshold is flanked by qualitative 
criteria to ensure that only small institutions 
with a simple business model can fall within the scope of the “small banking box”. Exem -
plary calculations show that even if the “small 
banking box” were to apply to a large number 
of banks, the vast majority of the German 
banking system’s total assets would be super -
vised according to the general rules.Deutsche Bundesbank

The Eurosystem’s new money market 
statistical  reporting – initial results for 
Germany 
On 1 July 2016, the Eurosystem introduced money market statistical reporting (MMSR), under 
which monetary financial institutions (MFIs) have begun to report transactions in the euro money 
market on a daily, transaction- by- transaction basis. This provides the Eurosystem with compre -
hensive and standardised information of both a highly granular and very timely nature to assess 
the situation on the money market. Current data on activity in, the conditions on and the struc -
tures of the money market are of major importance for implementing monetary policy. Given the 
overriding importance of the money market in the monetary transmission process, the statistics 
constitute a considerably improved underlying dataset for a more targeted design of the monet -
ary policy toolkit.
The transactions captured in the scope of MMSR are euro- denominated money market transac -
tions in the secured, unsecured, foreign exchange (FX) swap and EONIA swap market segments 
for selected institutions. At present, the largest 52 institutions in the euro area are required to 
submit reports. Some 14 of these institutions are domiciled in Germany and submit their reports 
to the Bundesbank. Moreover, owing to the unique features of the German banking system, the 
Bundesbank collects data from additional reporting MFIs domiciled in Germany in order to ensure 
that the sample is representative. A total of 128 institutions are currently subject to a reporting 
requirement.
On the basis of the data collected during the first year of MMSR, this article presents the current 
structure of the euro area money market, in particular for the German market. The lion’s share of 
the trading volume was attributable to secured transactions. The survey found that trading in the 
secured and unsecured segments, as well as in foreign exchange swaps, was concentrated on 
overnight maturities. The bulk of secured trading and foreign exchange swaps took place between 
banks and across borders. In the unsecured money market, on the other hand, trading with non- 
banks was more pronounced, with a particular focus on transactions with resident counterpar -
ties.
MMSR will be used in future to not only analyse and assess the state of the euro money market 
but also so that the Eurosystem can provide an unsecured overnight reference interest rate.Deutsche Bundesbank

The importance of MMSR 
for the Eurosystem
The introduction on 1  July 2016 of MMSR1 
means that, for the first time, transactions con -
ducted by MFIs in the Eurosystem money mar -
ket are being reported on a daily, transaction-  
by- transaction basis. This provides the Eurosys -
tem with standardised information of both a 
highly granular and very timely nature to assess 
the situation on the euro money market.
The monetary transmission process begins with 
the money market. Granular and timely infor -
mation on money market activities and condi -
tions is therefore of major importance for im -
plementing monetary policy. In order to assess 
the effects of monetary policy, a profound 
understanding of the liquidity and funding 
costs of the banking system in the euro area is 
required. This is also highly topical in the 
present monetary policy environment, which is 
characterised by the Eurosystem operating as 
an intermediary and by large quantities of ex -
cess liquidity.2 In addition, money market ten -
sions during the financial crisis exposed the 
need to comprehensively monitor the function -
ing of the money market for monetary policy 
purposes. On the basis of solid evidence, more 
targeted measures can be taken in a crisis situ -
ation to maintain an appropriate monetary 
transmission process without monetary policy 
measures unduly constraining the functioning 
of the market.
In essence, the transactions captured in the 
scope of MMSR are euro- denominated money 
market transactions effected by selected euro 
area institutions in the secured, unsecured, for -
eign exchange swap and EONIA3 swap market 
segments. The deadline for submitting the data 
collected to the Bundesbank is 6:30 on the 
business day following the conclusion of the 
transaction.4 This ensures that the required in -
formation is available in a timely manner and 
makes it possible to both assess the current 
market situation and analyse structural devel -
opments over time.Selection of reporting agents
Statistical data on money market transactions 
are collected from a sample of the 52 largest 
euro area MFIs, with the exception of money 
market funds (hereinafter referred to as the Eu -
rosystem sample).5 An MFI is required to report 
data on money market transactions if, on 
31 December 2014, its total main balance sheet 
assets exceeded 0.35% of the total main bal -
ance sheet assets of all euro area MFIs. This 
number does not include branches outside the 
country of domicile of the reporting agent. The 
total main balance sheet assets are calculated 
by the European Central Bank (ECB) based on 
data on the consolidated MFI balance sheets 
collected by the national central banks for their 
respective member states.6 Under this criterion, 
14 institutions domiciled in Germany submit re -
ports to the Bundesbank.
The Regulation also enables the national cen -
tral banks to define the set of reporting agents 
as larger than the minimum framework set for 
the euro area. This right was granted in order 
to accommodate unique features in individual 
countries that play a major role in obtaining a 
representative set of money market statistics. Debut of collec-

by banks in the deposit facility. Prior to the outbreak of the 
financial crisis in October 2008, the Eurosystem supplied 
the banking system with central bank money such that 
there was no meaningful excess liquidity (and also no 
shortage of central bank money).

has not been implemented yet, however.

Germany is a case in point. Its banking system 
has a much more heterogeneous structure, 
with a large share of smaller institutions, than 
those of many other countries in the euro area. 
In addition, banks in Germany are key actors in 
the euro money market since, for instance, 
they have traditionally been heavily involved in 
the (cross- border) redistribution of central bank 
liquidity. In order to analyse the money market 
and its structure, it is therefore important to 
also obtain information on whether, and to 
what extent, smaller institutions, as well as 
those with a variety of business models, are 
active  in the money market. In view of these 
factors, it was necessary to enlarge the group 
of reporting agents in Germany in an appropri -
ate manner.
Two criteria motivate the sample selection for 
Germany. The first is that institutions have to 
have possessed a TARGET2 payment module 
account (PM account)7 on 31 December 2014. 
Second, the amount of total main balance 
sheet assets has to have been over €1 billion 
on that date. Dependent branches whose par -
ent company is domiciled in the euro area were 
excluded from the sample. In order to ensure 
proportionality, an optional exemption from 
the reporting requirement was created. This 
option is available if an institution has not 
made any transactions via its PM account that 
have to be reported under MMSR since 1 Janu -
ary 2014. However, once such a transaction is 
completed, it must be reported to the Bundes -
bank immediately by the institution. The ex -
emption then expires.
A total of 128 institutions in Germany are re -
quired to submit reports to the Bundesbank for 
MMSR purposes (hereinafter referred to as the 
Bundesbank sample). This comprises not only 
the largest institutions domiciled in Germany 
but also additional institutions from, inter alia, 
the savings bank and cooperative bank sector, 
as well as regional banks.MMSR coverage
General reporting items
MMSR covers euro- denominated transactions 
effected by reporting agents in the secured, 
unsecured, foreign exchange swap and EONIA 
swap (euro overnight index swaps, or OIS) mar -
ket segments.
Both borrowing and lending are reported in the 
scope of MMSR (bilateral reporting). This also 
makes it possible to capture transactions of re -
porting MFIs with counterparties not covered 
by the sample. Counterparties can be matched 
for particular evaluation purposes if both coun -
terparties are reporting agents. This can occur 
either via a unique transaction identifier (UTI) or 
– if no UTI has been reported – via the transac -
tion’s individual attributes.
Individual transactions with other MFIs, other 
financial intermediaries (OFIs), insurance cor -
porations, pension funds, general government 
or non- financial corporations (wholesale8 trans -
actions) are to be reported. Transactions with 
central banks for investment purposes have to 
be reported as well.9 As regards unsecured 
lending, only transactions with other MFIs are 
subject to the reporting requirement. As a gen -
eral rule, transactions with a maturity of up to 
and including 397 days after the settlement 
date are reported. An exception is the EONIA 
swap market segment: here, transactions are 
to be reported for all maturities.Criteria for

via Clearstream) and the settlement of retail payments. The 
PM account can also be used to obtain intraday credit and 
for recourse to standing facilities. This account is intended 
to settle the cash leg of open market operations and can 
also be used for holding minimum reserves.

The following information must be reported for 
all market segments: attributes which clearly 
identify the transaction; information on the 
counterparty; data on the conclusion, settle -
ment and maturity; as well as the volume and 
conditions. Additional attributes must be given 
depending on the market segment.
Reporting items specific to 
market segments
As regards the secured segment of the money 
market, MFIs report repos, securities lending 
against cash as well as buy and sell- back trans -
actions. Transactions can have either a fixed 
maturity (“fixed- term”) or the option of extend -
ing or ending the arrangement on any given 
date (“open- basis”). If an open- basis transac -
tion is rolled over, it is reported on a daily basis 
until termination. The nominal amount and 
interest rate for the transaction are reported in 
this market segment. The MFI reports whether the interest rate is fixed or floating (variable 
rate). Information on the collateral posted is 
also provided, specifying whether it is single 
collateral, multiple collateral or a collateral 
pool. If available, the international securities 
identification number (ISIN) of the collateral 
item(s) is included in the report. Otherwise, 
identifying features of the collateral such as the 
sector of the issuer, the CFI code10 or informa -
tion as to whether it is a pool without an ISIN 
or not are reported. Further information to be 
provided includes the nominal value of the col -
lateral and any haircut.
Items that are required to be reported in the 
unsecured market segment include deposits, 
call money/ call accounts and short- term secur -
ities. The latter include certificates of deposits,

notes and other short- term debt securities is -Reporting

Call money and call accounts – just like open- 
basis transactions in the secured market seg -
ment – are reported on a daily basis until they 
mature. Here, it is the outstanding amounts at 
the end of the business day and not individual 
transactions that are to be reported. MFIs re -
port purchases and sales of short- term secur -
ities only upon issue; secondary market trading 
is not subject to the reporting requirement. 
Other items to likewise be reported in the un -
secured market segment are the nominal 
amount and the interest rate for the transac -
tion, broken down by fixed rate or variable rate 
remuneration. In this segment, borrowing 
transactions with all above- mentioned counter -
parties are reported. For lending, only transac -
tions with other MFIs are reported.11 Specific -
ally for this market segment, the type of instru -
ment and additional attributes are to be listed 
where the transaction contains a call/ put op -
tion on the part of the creditor or debtor.
Foreign exchange swap transactions in which 
the euro is one of the exchanged currencies fall 
under the reporting requirement. Such transac -
tions are relevant for the analysis of the euro 
area money market owing to their impact on 
euro liquidity. For this market segment, too, the 
nominal amount of the transaction, the foreign 
exchange spot rate and foreign exchange for -
ward points are to be given. The report also 
includes the foreign currency.
In the case of EONIA swaps, the EONIA variable 
overnight rate (a reference rate for unsecured 
euro overnight trading) is exchanged for a fixed 
interest rate. These transactions are reported 
under MMSR irrespective of their maturity. Not 
only the nominal amount but also the agreed 
fixed rate of the transaction is reported.Overview of the data in the 
context of the Eurosystem
The collection of statistical data on money mar -
ket transactions commenced on 1 July 2016. In 
order to gain an initial overview of the informa -
tion acquired since then, the trading volumes 
of the secured, unsecured and foreign ex -
change swap market segments will be exam -
ined. It is not possible to comment on the 
EONIA swap segment due to statistical confi -
dentiality.
The first year of MMSR was characterised by a 
high level of excess liquidity, stemming espe -
cially from the Eurosystem’s high volume of 
asset purchases for monetary policy purposes.12 
Purchases made under the expanded asset pur -
chase programme (APP) increased excess li -
quidity from just over €900 billion in July 2016 
to around €1,600 billion in June 2017. At the 
same time, the Eurosystem’s deposit facility 
rate remained unchanged at -0.40%. Owing to 
the very high level of excess liquidity, the de -
posit facility rate currently serves as the refer -
ence rate for the EONIA, meaning that the 
EONIA hovered between -0.32% and -0.37% 
in the period observed. These conditions also 
had an impact on money market activity.
The 52 institutions included in the Eurosystem 
sample reported an average volume of just 
under €800 billion per business day (for around 
37,000 transactions each day) within the first 
year of MMSR in the secured, unsecured and 
foreign exchange swap segments. A compari -
son of the three market segments analysed 
shows that the secured segment had the larg -
est share of the total volume, followed by for -
eign exchange swaps and the unsecured seg -
ment.In unsecured

Looking at the geographical distribution of the 
counterparties shows that more than half of all 
transactions in the unsecured money market 
were concluded with domestic counterparties, 
ie with counterparties resident in the same 
country as the reporting institution. The bulk of 
foreign exchange swaps took place across bor -
ders, however. These were split roughly evenly 
between transactions with counterparties 
domiciled within and outside the euro area.13
Building on this initial overview of MMSR in the 
Eurosystem context, this article will now 
present a more in- depth, data- based examin -
ation of the euro money market in Germany.
Detailed analysis of the euro 
money market in Germany 
based on the Bundesbank 
sample
In the scope of MMSR, a total transaction 
amount of €67 trillion was reported in the se -
cured, unsecured and foreign exchange swap 
segments by the 128 reporting MFIs in Ger -
many (including the 14 institutions also in -
cluded in the Eurosystem sample) between 
1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. The transaction 
amount was spread across around 6 million re -
ported transactions. A volume of over €260 bil -lion on average was traded each business day 
(at around 23,000 transactions per day).
As in the Eurosystem sample, the largest share 
of the volume for the MFIs in Germany subject 
to the reporting requirement came from the se -
cured segment, at just under €31 trillion. This 
corresponds to a share of around 46% of the 
transactions reported in the three segments 
under review. The unsecured segment and for -
eign exchange swaps accounted for around 
27% (€18 trillion) of the contracts traded. 
Roughly half of the trading volume was attrib -
utable to borrowing and the other half to lend -
ing, an exception being the unsecured seg -
ment, which had a significantly higher share of 
borrowing. This is due to the asymmetrical re -
porting requirement: in the case of lending, 
only interbank market transactions are to be 
reported. When interpreting these aggregate 
figures, it should also be borne in mind that 
transactions between reporting agents are re -
ported bilaterally.Lion’s share

The number of transactions was dominated by 
unsecured money market trading at just under 
4 million transactions (64%). This is due to the 
high proportion of smaller reporting agents, 
which were active in greater numbers in the 
unsecured market. The secured segment ac -
counted for 30% of the contracts and foreign 
exchange swaps for just under 7%. The notably 
smaller proportion of foreign exchange swaps 
is attributable to the higher transaction 
amounts on average. The foreign exchange 
swap figure therefore stood at €47 million, 
while the figures for the secured and unsecured 
segments amounted to €17 million and €5 mil -
lion respectively. However, the median for each 
segment was significantly below these values 
in some cases. This shows that a large number 
of transactions with somewhat smaller volumes 
were reported compared to a low number of 
high- volume transactions.
Secured money market
In the secured segment, transactions were split 
almost equally between borrowing (around 
€16 trillion) and lending (around €15 trillion). 
The institutions included in the Bundesbank 
sample concluded most of their secured trad -
ing contracts across borders. Some 75% of 
lending and 88% of borrowing was conducted 
with counterparties domiciled abroad, most of 
it with counterparties outside the euro area.
An analysis of the counterparties reveals that 
just under 80% of transactions were concluded 
in the interbank market.14 At the same time, 
just over 60% of all transactions were settled 
via a CCP . Nevertheless, the vast majority of the 
transactions (more than 80%) were traded 
against individual securities and not against a 
range of securities with established minimum 
standards (“baskets”, which are often provided 
by CCPs). This suggests that, in the current 
market environment, secured transactions are 
often driven by securities and less by liquidity.Around three- quarters of the securities posted 
as collateral were government bonds. In add -
ition, approximately 50% of the transactions 
carried out by institutions in the Bundesbank 
sample were concluded against collateral is -
sued in Germany. Securities issued in France 
and Italy were also posted more often as collat -
eral.15

were concluded with a maturity of one day 
(overnight, tom/ next and spot/ next).16 This is 
partly attributable to the fact that open- basis 
transactions have to be reported daily for as 
long as they continue to be rolled over. In the 
case of longer maturities, transactions in the 
secured borrowing segment were primarily 
concluded with a maturity of one week, while, 
in the lending segment, this maturity reached 
one month.Unsecured money market
In the period under review, around €2 trillion in 
borrowing operations and €4 trillion in lending 
operations were carried out in the unsecured 
interbank market. The agents reporting to the 
Bundesbank were therefore more likely to be 
lenders on average. With regard to lending, 
what is noteworthy about this segment is that 
only interbank activity is reported. In the case 
of borrowing, however, transactions with non- 
banks are reported in the scope of MMSR. The 
inclusion of these transactions results in a total 
borrowing figure of around €14 trillion, ie the 
interbank market constituted only around 13% 
of the total unsecured borrowing transactions 
recorded. A greater share of the transactions 
with non- banks were, in particular, with non-  
financial corporations and investment funds, 
with the exception of money market funds.
An analysis of the counterparties’ countries of 
domicile highlights the fact that institutions in 
the unsecured market segment were primarily 
active in their home markets. In the interbank 
market, 93% of the lending transaction volume 
and 56% of the borrowing transaction volume 
was conducted with banks domiciled in Ger -
many. Taking all counterparties into account, 
83% of borrowing transactions were carried 
out in Germany. The discernible preference for 
trading with domestic counterparties in the un -
secured segment can be attributed, first, to the 
greater degree of information generally avail -
able on these counterparties. Second, the pre- 
existing network systems in Germany also con -
tribute to domestic market activity.

deposits and call money/ call accounts. In the

54% of the traded volume, while call money 
and call accounts accounted for 44%. In terms 
of lending, the share of the latter was in fact 
just under 76% (deposits: 23%), which can be 
attributed to the fact that they are reported on 
a daily basis when rolled over. Sales and pur -
chases of short- term securities on the primary 
market made up less than 2% of the traded 
volume in each case. When analysing the bor -
rowing levels of all counterparties, the share of 
call money and call accounts was significantly 
higher than the corresponding share in the 
interbank market, at 71%. Only 28% of trans -
actions were concluded in the form of deposits 
with a fixed maturity.
In the interbank market, by far the largest share 
of the transaction amount went to the over -
night segment, where 89% of lending and 
70% of borrowing took place with a one- day 
maturity (overnight, tom/ next and spot/ next). 
When all counterparties were included, the 
share of overnight borrowing was still 62%. In 
the case of longer maturities, even greater bor -
rowing activity could be observed in the un -
secured segment for maturities of up to three 
months.
Foreign exchange swap 
market 
In the foreign exchange swap segment, MFIs 
traded a total volume of around €18 trillion. As 
in the secured segment, reports were spread 
almost evenly between transactions that ab -
sorbed euro liquidity and transactions that gen -
erated euro liquidity. Over 80% of the foreign 
exchange swaps involved an exchange of euro 
liquidity for US dollars, with the other main cur -
rencies for which the euro was exchanged 
being the pound sterling, Swiss francs and yen.
Over 80% of the counterparties in foreign ex -
change swaps were banks, and only 18% of 
the counterparties purchasing euro were domi -
ciled in Germany (15% in the case of counter -
parties selling euro). Just under half of the transactions were concluded with counterpar -
ties domiciled in the United States, the United 
Kingdom and France. Maturities were chiefly in 
the overnight segment with a 55% share, while 
increased activity was also observable in the 
one- week and one- month segments.
Conclusion and outlook
The data collected under MMSR open the door 
to a comprehensive, daily and granular insight 
into the activities on, and structure of, the euro 
money market. Unlike previous surveys and 
other data sources that depict individual sec -
tions of the money market, usually geared to a 
specific reporting date, the Eurosystem’s MMSR 
provides the opportunity to systematically as -
sess the functional ability of, and dynamics of 
change in, the money market and to detect 
structural change earlier than before. The new 
MMSR framework will thus strengthen the Eu -
rosystem’s analytical capacity. Given the over -Deposits and

riding importance of the money market in the 
monetary transmission process, the statistics 
provide a considerably improved basis for a 
more targeted design of the monetary policy 
toolkit in future.
In all of the segments analysed in this article, it 
can be observed that euro money market trad -
ing in Germany was mainly concentrated on 
overnight maturities. Most of the trading was 
also between banks; only in the unsecured 
money market was trading with non- banks 
more pronounced. This segment also predom -
inantly saw trading with counterparties domi -
ciled in Germany, while cross- border transac -
tions were predominant in the secured and 
foreign exchange swap segments. It becomes 
clear when comparing the segments that se -
cured transactions make up the lion’s share of 
the trading volumes. This secured trading is 
carried out chiefly via CCPs and government 
bonds are generally posted as collateral, with 
most of the posted collateral being issued in 
Germany. Deposit business (deposits and call 
money/ call accounts) are predominant in the 
unsecured segment, while the trading of short- 
term securities on the primary market plays a 
negligible role. The vast majority of foreign ex -
change swaps are transactions against the US 
dollar.
The Bundesbank sample, which is broader 
compared to the Eurosystem sample and which 
also includes smaller MFIs, reveals differences 
between the money market activities of smaller 
and larger institutions in Germany. For instance, the smaller institutions effect a large number of 
comparatively smaller transactions and are pri -
marily active in the unsecured money market 
segment. The data indicate that the inclusion 
of additional MFIs – with their variety of busi -
ness models  – could deliver much deeper 
knowledge.
The observed money market activities took 
place in a monetary setting characterised by 
high excess liquidity and negative interest rates, 
considerably affecting the way market partici -
pants trade in the money market. With the aid 
of MMSR, it will be possible in future to identify 
the extent to which money market activities are 
adapting to an evolving monetary setting.
In future, the Bundesbank will regularly publish 
aggregate data from the Bundesbank sample 
on interest rates and volumes for various seg -
ments and maturities on the money market. 
Corresponding data on the Eurosystem sample 
will be provided by the ECB. The purpose of 
this will be to enhance market transparency 
and therefore improve money market function -
ing.
MMSR will be used in future not only to ana -
lyse and assess the state of the euro money 
market but also so that the Eurosystem can 
provide a reference interest rate. On 21 Sep -
tember 2017, the Eurosystem announced that it 
will prepare and publish an unsecured over -
night reference rate before 2020. The reports 
collected as part of MMSR in the unsecured 
segment will be used for this purpose.Money market

The new ESCB insurance statistics – 
integrated  reporting flow and initial results
The ESCB statistics on the assets and liabilities of insurance corporations were harmonised at the 
European level at the beginning of 2016. At the same time, a new reporting flow was introduced. 
For the first time, data are now collected jointly for both supervisory and statistical purposes to 
avoid burdening insurers with multiple data surveys.
The statistics are used in various contexts, such as analyses relating to financial stability policy 
and monetary policy. In addition, the fact that all definitions and classifications in the statistics 
are based on the European System of Accounts (ESA 2010) means that the data can be used as 
a building block in the financial accounts.
These innovations have expanded the insurance statistics in several ways. Balance sheet items are 
now reported on a quarterly basis and assets and liabilities are recorded consistently at market 
value and broken down further by country and economic sector of the debtors or creditors. Fur -
thermore, the results can be made available earlier than before and are also more comparable 
within the euro area.
The aggregate total assets of insurance corporations resident in Germany came to €2,178 billion 
at mid-2017. The insurance technical reserves amounted to €1,505 billion, thus accounting for just 
under 70% of liabilities. Life insurers made up more than half (€1,173 billion) of aggregate total 
assets. Combined with those of non- life insurers, the assets of primary insurers came to €1,776 
billion; reinsurance corporations contributed €402 billion to the sector’s aggregate total assets.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
October 2017

Integrated statistical report -
ing with a broad scope of 
application
The harmonised ESCB insurance statistics first 
published in 2016 have broken new ground in 
data collection. Based on the reporting of 
granular data, an innovative approach was 
used to combine the data required for supervis -
ory and statistical purposes into a single report -
ing standard and coordinate the reporting 
dates. This enables insurance corporations to 
meet the reporting requirements of various in -
stitutions in Germany and Europe by submit -
ting a single report.
A number of policy areas require reliable and 
timely data on the insurance sector that can be 
analysed in different ways. In financial stability 
analysis, granular data can play an important 
role in identifying transmission and feedback 
mechanisms between insurers, other financial 
sectors and the real economy. The expanded 
insurance statistics open up new avenues for 
analysing these types of issues. As the data are 
broken down further than before, investment 
shifts and their effects on individual sectors can 
be examined more closely. In addition, the new 
dataset allows analysts to better assess interde -
pendencies within the financial system. For ex -
ample, the statistics capture insurers’ invest -
ment fund holdings, making it possible to per -
form network analyses. Harmonised data col -
lection at the European level allows consistent 
analyses and comparisons to be carried out 
across national borders.
In the sphere of monetary policy, the harmon -
ised statistics can help to forge a deeper under -
standing of transmission channels. For ex -
ample, the investment behaviour of insurance 
corporations will probably be affected by mon -
etary policy measures, such as policy rate 
changes and purchases or sales of financial 
assets. In turn, this behaviour has an impact on 
the financial markets and thus on macroeco -
nomic funding conditions, which means that 
findings on how insurers respond to such measures are relevant to monetary policy 
decision- making.
As the definitions used in the ESCB insurance 
statistics are fully harmonised with the ESA 
2010 guidelines, the statistics can also be used 
as a building block in the financial accounts.
The new reporting flow
The new harmonised ESCB statistics on insur -
ance corporations fulfil the stated aim of cen -
tral bank statisticians to make a paradigm shift 
away from solely providing aggregated statis -
tics towards gathering granular microdata that 
have multidimensional uses.1 That is why the 
statistics are closely based on the supervisory 
reporting introduced at the same time for in -
surers in the European Economic Area (EEA), 
known as Pillar III, which is an integral part of 
the Solvency II supervisory regime.
The development of a harmonised data collec -
tion system requires intensive cooperation be -
tween the institutions involved – both at the 
national level, between the Bundesbank and 
the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority 
(BaFin), and at the European level, between the 
ECB and the European Insurance and Occupa -
tional Pensions Authority (EIOPA). For the ESCB 
insurance statistics, this cooperation began at 
an early stage in the planning process.2 This 
made it possible to integrate the additional in -
formation needed for the statistics into the 
Solvency II templates.3Harmonised

2 The amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 2533/ 98 
created the legal basis for the new ESCB insurance statis -
tics: Council Regulation (EC) No 2533/ 98 of 23 November 
1998 concerning the collection of statistical information by 
the European Central Bank, amended by Council Regula -
tion (EC) No 951/ 2009 of 9 October 2009. In the wake of 
the financial crisis, this amendment enabled the ECB to 
commission statistical surveys of insurance corporations 
and pension funds as well from autumn 2009 onwards.
3 The unofficial Solvency II templates are available on the 
Bundesbank’s website ( www.bundesbank.de/ en ) under 
“Statistics/  Banks and other financial institutions/  Insurance 
corporations and pension funds”.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
October 2017  
68

This fulfilled a key prerequisite for implement -
ing a single reporting flow for supervision and 
statistics. In addition, the same submission 
deadlines were set for the statistical reports as 
for Solvency II, meaning that reporting agents 
have only a single report to submit. They send 
the data to BaFin, which forwards them directly 
to the Bundesbank.
By submitting this report, the reporting agents 
fulfil the requirements of two ESCB statistical 
regulations at the same time: the regulation on 
ESCB insurance statistics4 and the German con -
tribution to the ESCB statistics on holdings of 
securities.5 The fact that the same data can be 
used for multiple purposes is due, not least, to 
the quarterly reporting of assets on a security- 
by- security basis. Like all surveys based on mi -
crodata, this approach allows flexible analyses 
to be carried out for various user groups and 
institutions.
Expanding the reference 
data and implementation
New breakdowns have been added to the stat -
istics, including by economic sector and issuer 
or debtor residence. In addition, further im -
provements have been made over the previous 
non- harmonised dataset, which was essentially 
based on an uncoordinated body of European 
supervisory data dating back to 2005. Enhance-
ments include measuring insurance technical 
reserves at market value and increasing the re -
porting frequency for liability items from an -
nual to quarterly intervals. Furthermore, the 
statistical results are now being made available 
ever more quickly than in the past. At the start -
ing date in 2016, the individual reporting 
agents were asked to submit their reports 
within eight weeks of the reporting date; this 
deadline is being shortened by one week per 
year until it reaches five weeks in the first quar -
ter of 2019.
Insurance corporations submitted their first full 
quarterly reports for the end-  March 2016 re -porting period in May 2016.6 Given the steady 
improvement in the quality and stability of the 
dataset over the course of the year, the results 
for the new ESCB insurance statistics were first 
published as early as the third quarter of 2016 
and thus so far comprise four quarters worth of 
data. It is still too early to identify the longer-  
term developments because the data are not 
fully comparable with the previous supervisory 
data under Solvency I. The remainder of this 
article will therefore focus on the current data 
as at mid-2017.
Initial results
As at the second quarter of 2017, 341 domestic 
insurance corporations submitted reports under 
the new insurance statistics regime. Specifically,

were subject to the reporting obligation. Of 
these enterprises, 74 provided only aggregated 
data for the quarter and submitted granular 
data on their assets in their annual reporting 
(as at 31 December). The coverage of full re -
porters – relative to the aggregate total assets 
of the insurance sector – came to more than 
95% as at the second quarter of 2017.7
At mid-2017, domestic insurers managed assets 
with an aggregate market value of €2,178 bil -
lion. At €1,089 billion overall, claims on banks 
– ie monetary financial institutions (MFIs) – 
together  with loans and debt securities ac -
counted for half of the total assets. Just under 
30% (€642 billion) of the total assets were 
invested  indirectly through investment fund 
shares.8 Equity worth €302 billion, on the other 
hand, made up only 14%. More than half of 
the aggregate total assets could be attributed 
to life insurers, which is why the structure of 
the entire portfolio is shaped by this segment.
The aggregate total assets of life insurance cor -
porations resident in Germany came to €1,173 
billion at mid-2017. This amount was largely 
balanced by households’ life insurance entitle -
ments worth €989 billion on the liabilities side.
Life insurers have a growing tendency to invest 
indirectly by purchasing investment fund shares. At mid-2017, they held shares with a 
market value of €466 billion, or 40% of their 
total assets, investing primarily in bond funds 
and mixed funds (36% and 38%, respectively, 
of the investment fund shares). Whereas dir -
ectly held equity, with a market value of €39 
billion, made up only 3% of the total assets, a 
further €86 billion was invested in this asset 
class by way of equity funds. Around a quarter 
of the volume of investment fund shares held 
was investments under unit- linked life insur -
ance policies.
Just over half of the total investments was at -
tributable, all in roughly equal measure, to 
three positions: bank (MFI) deposits (€209 bil -
lion), loans9 (€215 billion) and debt securities 
(€200 billion). While the domestic share of the 
two first-  named forms of investment, at 71% 
and 79%, respectively, was clearly predomin -
ant, it accounted for only 11% in the case of 
debt securities. Loans to central, state and local 
governments amounted to a total of €95 bil -
lion, of which €71 billion was granted in Ger -
many. Claims on households10 came to €50 bil -
lion and involved almost exclusively domestic 
debtors. A total of 87% of the debt securities 
was spread across three sectors: banks (MFIs) 
with holdings of €55 billion, general govern -
ment with €78 billion, and other financial insti -
tutions with €41 billion. Debt securities issued 
by non- financial corporations accounted for 
12% (€25 billion) of the position.
At €989 billion, insurance technical reserves 
were responsible for 84% of the liabilities at 
mid- year, with the share of unit- linked life in -
surance contracts coming to 12% (€114 bil -
lion). Classic life insurance thus continues to be Aggregate total

7 In order to avoid placing additional burdens on insurers, 
the Bundesbank has adopted the reporting population de -
fined by BaFin here.

There is therefore some deviation from the published ag -
gregate Solvency II data.

include registered securities issued by banks as well as 
loans against borrowers’ notes. The same applies to loans.

of great importance. Around 13% of the insur -
ance technical liabilities existed in connection 
with pension fund entitlements. Equity capital, 
calculated in the insurance statistics as the re -
sidual of assets less liabilities, totalled €120 bil -
lion.
Domestic non- life insurers managed assets 
worth €603 billion as at the end of June 2017. 
Private health insurance is also captured within 
this group; its share of this sub- sector’s aggre -
gate total assets stood at 53%.
At €114 billion, almost one- fifth of financial re -
sources were invested in the form of deposits, 
registered securities and loans against borrow -
ers’ notes with domestic and foreign banks; 
71% of this figure was with domestic MFIs. 
Credit claims on the other economic sectors 
amounted to €90 billion, or 15% of assets; 
here, too, the domestic share was dominant, at 
77%. Just over half of the total amount was 
accounted for by claims on general govern -ment, where the domestic share stood at 
around 75%. Holdings of directly purchased 
debt securities came to €107 billion, or 18% of 
assets. As was the case with life insurers, the 
proportion of domestic issuers was low in this 
category, too, at only 10% of the total, while 
issuance from other countries of the euro area, 
at €56 billion, accounted for more than half of 
the position. Equity came to €58 billion, or 
10% of assets, just under three- quarters of 
which were unlisted shares.
Indirect investment via investment funds also 
plays a major role for non- life insurers, with 
holdings of investment fund shares at mid-
2017 totalling €160 billion, or 27% of assets. 
Bond funds and mixed funds accounted for 
83% of these holdings.
Insurance technical reserves worth €407 billion 
were responsible for 67% of total assets. Just 
under three- quarters of this amount (€302 bil -

within their insurance group. Shares in unlisted 
public limited companies made up 80% of this 
figure, with other equity accounting for a fur -
ther €37 billion. Other financial institutions 
(€117 billion) and insurers (€73 billion) were the 
biggest issuers.
Apart from equity, the largest individual asset 
class, at just over one- fifth of total assets (€86 
billion), was directly held debt securities, the 
main issuers of which were non- euro area resi -
dents. Loans, which totalled €56 billion, or 
14% of assets, also include deposit claims on 
primary insurers. The latter amounted to €33 
billion at the reporting date. At 44%, equity 
fund shares made up almost half of the €17 
billion worth of investment fund shares overall.
The liabilities side included insurance technical 
reserves in the amount of €109 billion. In a re -
flection of the international nature of these en -
terprises’ operations, in particular those of 
large reinsurers, around two- thirds of these 
liabil ities are to foreign counterparties. The vast 
majority of reinsured risks are in the area of 
non- life insurance, with the share of reinsur -ance in the area of life insurance coming to 
15%.
