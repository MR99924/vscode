Underlying trends
Following subdued growth in the fourth
quarter of 2009 and the first quarter of 2010,
the German economy picked up significantly
early in the second quarter. The flow of indus-
trial orders broadened substantially and the
construction sector is now rapidly making up
for the output losses caused by the very cold
winter weather. Real GDP is therefore likely to
increase significantly in the second quarter of
2010. The main driving force behind the
strengthening recovery of the German econ-
omy is the global economic upturn, which is
most noticeable in a rapid increase of orders
from non-euro-area countries. Manufacturers
of intermediate goods are still the main bene-
ficiaries of this, especially as the upturn ap-
pears to be supported by the inventory cycle
at present. Furthermore, fixed capital forma-
tion is picking up again in the corporate sec-
tor. Finally, construction demand is benefiting
from the government economic stimulus
packages. Despite comparatively stable retail
sales, private consumption is still likely to be
down on the quarter owing to the continuing
decline in motor vehicle purchases. The
heightened uncertainty owing to the deteri-
oration of the budgetary situation in a num-
ber of euro-area partner countries has not yet
had a discernible impact.

6which can be found in a number of short-
term economic indicators, is likely to have
been due primarily to the early date of Easter.
The disruptions in air freight transport may
also have played a part in this. On an average
of March and April taken together – this
aggregation can be used to smooth out
short-term fluctuations – there was a 41/C254%
rise on the preceding two-month period and
thus a clear upward tendency. Intermediate
and capital goods grew by more than 5% in
fact, whereas there was no significant in-
crease in the case of consumer goods. Output
in the motor vehicle industry, in particular
– which is included among manufacturers of
capital goods – was stepped up dramatically
(+73/C254%) owing to the strong demand for
commercial purposes and for exports. Even
output in the mechanical engineering sector,
where signs of recovery have so far been
muted, expanded by 53/C254%.
There was a further perceptible seasonally ad-
justed rise in the demand for industrial goods
in April following the sharp growth in March.
There was a price-adjusted increase of 63/C254%
on an average of these two months com-
pared with the preceding two-month period.
The increase in domestic orders, at 61/C254%,
was almost as high as that in export orders
(7%). Following an extended period in which
demand from other euro-area countries had
been very moderate, it picked up much more
sharply, at 83/C254%, than orders from countries
outside the euro area (53/C254%), which had
been very dynamic before, however. Orders
of intermediate goods went up particularly
sharply (+7%). Capital goods increased byEconomic conditions in Germany*

763/C254%, a considerable part of which was ac-
counted for by motor vehicles.
While seasonally adjusted domestic sales of
industrial goods remained virtually un-changed on the month in April, export salesincreased considerably. Comparing both ofthe last two-month periods, there wasgrowth of 5% in domestic sales and 4% inexport sales. In terms of value, exports ofgoods, which have been showing a muchmore volatile growth pattern over the pastfew months than export turnover, were 6%down on the month in April, having increasedby 10
3/C254% in March. In the two-month period
of March and April, they went up by 101/C254%
on the January-February figure, however. Im-ports of goods also declined in April (-7
1/C254%).
Nevertheless, an increase was recorded heretoo (7
1/C252%) when comparing the two-month
periods. During the same period, the foreigntrade surplus rose by just over one-quarter to313 billion on average.
ConstructionConstruction activity in April showed a fur-
ther improvement on the high level reachedin March and is likely to quickly offset theweather-related losses of the first twomonths of the year. This applies equally to thebuilding industry and civil engineering. Ordersreceived in March – more recent figures areunavailable at present – were down some-what on the exceptionally sharp rise in Febru-ary, but the volume of orders is still above theaverage demand for 2009.Labour market
The labour market situation has improved
again noticeably. According to provisional fig-ures released by the Federal Statistical Office,there was quite a clear seasonally adjustedrise on the month in the number of personsin work in April (38,000). Initial estimatesindicate that the number of jobs subjectto social security contributions rose sharplyagain in March following a temporary stagna-tion at the beginning of the year. The numberof new registrations for (cyclically induced)short-time work continued declining through-out the reporting period. In March, 693,000persons were receiving short-time workingbenefits. This was 117,000 fewer than inDecember. Given that the average loss ofworking hours went up to 33%, however,the nominal equivalent number of personsemployed remained virtually unchanged at226,000. According to both the FederalEmployment Agency’s BA-X index for non-government-assisted jobs and the Ifo employ-ment barometer for trade and industry, therewas a further increase in May in the willing-ness of enterprises to recruit new staff.
In line with the positive trend in employment,
unemployment showed a further decline inMay. The seasonally adjusted number of per-sons officially registered as unemployed wentdown by 45,000 to 3.25 million, and theunemployment rate fell to 7.7%, which wasthus 0.5 percentage point lower than oneyear previously.

fall.
Prices
The upward movement in crude oil prices,
which set in at the beginning of February, ab-
ruptly went into reverse in early May. Turmoil
in the financial markets, heightened uncer-
tainty about China’s future oil demand, and
higher inventory stocks in the United States
are likely to have played a significant role in
this decline. Oil prices have risen perceptibly
since the end of May, however. Expectations
of a pick-up in demand and a fierce hurricane
season in the Gulf of Mexico are likely to
have contributed to this. At US$773/C254per
barrel on a monthly average, the spot price of
Brent North Sea oil in May was 91/C252% lower
than in April. The price decrease for the euro
area, at 31/C252%, was much more subdued
owing to the depreciation of the euro against
the US dollar. As this report went to press,
the spot price stood at US$783/C254. Prices for
future deliveries of crude oil were being
quoted with somewhat lower premiums
again at the end of the period under review;
US$21/C254and US$53/C254were being charged for
six-month and 18-month deliveries respect-
ively.
There was a continuation of the upward price
trend at the upstream stages of the economy
owing to the recovery of the world economy
and the depreciation of the euro. There was a
sharp rise in energy prices – owing, among
other things, to the higher crude oil prices in
April – particularly in the case of imports, and
the cost of intermediate goods also rose quitesharply again. The upward price trend in the
case of imported capital goods and consumer
goods also accelerated. Domestic prices of
these goods remained virtually unchanged,
however. Overall, import prices in April were
up 1.6% on the month in seasonally adjusted
terms. The annual growth rate rose further to
7.9%. The month-on-month price rise in do-
mestic sales of industrial products was also
quite marked at 0.7%. The previously nega-
tive annual rate of change moved into posi-
tive territory and stood at 0.6% with the fig-
ure increasing further to 0.9% in May. This
can be attributed to a marked rise in prices
for intermediate goods and consumer goods,
whereas energy prices – in line with move-
ments in crude oil prices – declined on the
month in seasonally adjusted terms.
There was no further seasonally adjusted
month-on-month rise in consumer prices in
May. Energy, food and services became some-
what cheaper, whereas prices of other goods
increased. The decline in energy prices re-
mained very limited owing to the depreci-
ation of the euro. The prices of seasonal food
products largely returned to normal again
following the very sharp fluctuations in the
first quarter. However, dairy products con-
tinued to become more expensive with food
prices declining by just 0.8% overall as a
result. Furthermore, owing mainly to a reduc-
tion in prices for package holidays, consumers
had to pay somewhat less for services than in
the previous month. The rise in rents re-
mained moderate. According to both the
national consumer price index (CPI) and the
Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP),
consumer prices in May were up 1.2% on theInternational

Public finances1
Public long-term care insurance scheme
The public long-term care insurance scheme
recorded a slight deficit in the first quarter,
which constitutes a year-on-year financial
deterioration of 31/C254billion. Whereas revenue
increased by 21/C252%, expenditure grew at the
much faster pace of 61/C252%. The discretionary
increase in benefit rates on 1 January 2010,
which was agreed as part of the mid-2008
long-term care reform, played only a minor
role in this development.2Instead, a higher
take-up of the range of benefits, which was
extended by the same reform, was the key
factor behind expenditure growth. The shift
of emphasis from cash payments made
directly to persons in need of nursing care
towards non-financial benefits, particularly
out-patient or in-patient care, which has
been evident for some time now, continued
in the first quarter and accelerated the rise in
expenditure even further.
On the revenue side, the inflow of contri-
butions was almost 2% up on the year.
Employee contributions rose by only just over
1/C252%, whereas payments for recipients of un-
employment benefits (+12%) and for pen-
sioners (+21/C252%) recorded much stronger
growth. This reflects both the considerable
year-on-year rise in the number of recipients,
of unemployment benefit I in particular, ex-perienced in the first quarter and the large
pension increase in mid-2009.
Following the seasonal pattern, budget
balances are likely to be more favourable as
2010 progresses. However, given the spend-
ing surge and the fact that overall growth in
contribution receipts is expected to be only
subdued, this year’s result is likely to fall well
short of the 31 billion surplus posted for
2009. Looking further ahead, the demo-Finances of the public long-

10graphic trend means that the public long-
term care insurance scheme will be confront-
ed with both a weaker contributions base
and a significant rise in the number of recipi-
ents. The automatic adjustment of benefit
rates introduced with the 2008 reform ups
the pressure to raise contribution rates in the
long term.3
Securities markets
Bond market
With a gross issuance of 3118.2 billion in
April 2010, the issuance volume in the Ger-
man bond market was virtually unchanged
compared with the previous month ( 3118.1
billion). However, after deducting redemp-
tions, which declined to 3101.4 billion, and
taking account of changes in issuers’ holdings
of their own bonds, net sales of domestic
debt securities amounted to 315.9 billion and
were thus up on their March figure ( 33.7 bil-
lion). In the reporting month, the outstanding
volume of foreign debt securities in the Ger-
man market decreased by 30.7 billion, with
the result that the total volume of funds
raised on the German bond market increased
by32.1 billion on the month to 315.2 billion.
In April, the public sector issued debt secur-
ities worth 35.8 billion net, of which 34.1
billion were accounted for by central govern-
ment. While the outstanding volume of two-
year Federal Treasury notes (Sch/C228tze) and of
ten and thirty-year Federal bonds (Bunds)
went up by 35.6 billion, 33.1 billion and 34.1
billion respectively, there were net redemp-tions of Treasury discount paper (Bubills) and
five-year Federal notes (Bobls) in the amount
of32.5 billion and 36 billion respectively. On
balance, at 31.8 billion, net sales of debt
securities issued by state governments were
down by 31.0 billion on the month.
In April, German credit institutions raised
funds totalling 35.2 billion net, thus halting
the trend toward reducing their capital market
debt which had prevailed in the preceding
months. This development was due to the
actions of specialised credit institutions (eg
public promotional banks) which borrowed
311.4 billion in the bond market while re-
deeming mortgage Pfandbriefe ( 34.3 billion)
and public Pfandbriefe ( 31.7 billion). Redemp-
tions of other bank debt securities, which
amounted to 30.2 billion, were considerably
reduced compared with previous months.
Following the sharp increase in March in the
number of debt securities issued by domestic
enterprises, net sales in April fell to 34.9
billion, which was just above the level record-
ed at the beginning of the year. Short-term
new borrowing using commercial paper
played a major role in this development.
With regard to purchases, in contrast to the
development at the beginning of the year,
residents reduced their holdings of debt
3Initially, another round of discretionary increases is
planned as of 1 January 2012. The German Federal
Government will decide for the first time in 2014 (and
subsequently at three-yearly intervals) whether to raise
benefit rates again, basing its conclusion on general price
developments. However, the upper limit for adjusting
benefit rates in the labour-intensive long-term care sector
is to be capped at the rate of change in nominal gross
wages and salaries per employee (section 30 of the
Eleventh Book of the Social Security Code).Sales of debt

11securities by 34.1 billion. Domestic credit
institutions disposed of debt instruments inthe amount of 31.2 billion net, while non-
banks sold 32.9 billion worth of bonds. In
addition, domestic credit institutions tooksteps to restructure their portfolio, in accord-ance with which they offloaded private debtsecurities and, conversely, though to a some-what lesser extent, purchased public debtsecurities. Unlike in the case of residents,foreign investors extended their German bondportfolio by 319.3 billion. Of this amount,
315.5 billion alone was used to acquire debt
securities issued by the private sector.
Equity marketIn April, the volume of new shares placed in
the German equity market by domestic enter-prises ( 30.1 billion) was significantly lower
than in March ( 35.2 billion). By contrast, the
volume of foreign equities in the Germanmarket decreased by 33.8 billion, compared
with a 31.9 billion increase in March. On the
purchase side, residents sold 33.8 billion net
worth of foreign shares and bought domesticshares to the tune of 333.5 billion net. These,
in turn, stemmed largely from disposals byforeign investors ( 333.3 billion). German
credit institutions proved to be the mainresident purchasers ( 325.2 billion, compared
with 38 billion on the part of non-banks).
Mutual fund sharesIn April, domestic mutual fund shares record-
ed higher net inflows ( 38.4 billion) than in
March. The bulk of this amount was attribut-able to the specialised funds reserved for in-stitutional investors ( 37.4 billion), while do-
mestic funds open to the public saw inflowsof31.0 billion from investors. In this context,
equity-based and money market funds re-corded outflows of 31.0 billion and 30.3
billion respectively. Mixed funds and mixedsecurities funds both experienced inflows(31.1 billion and 30.6 billion respectively), as
did bond-based funds and open-end realestate funds, which each disposed of fundshares in the amount of 30.2 billion. Foreign
mutual investment funds likewise postedinflows from German investors ( 32.7 billion).
In the reporting month, mutual fund shareswere mainly purchased by domestic non-banks ( 38.3 billion) and only to a small extent
by domestic credit institutions ( 31.9 billion).

12Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur-
plus – in unadjusted terms – of 311.8 billion
in April 2010. The result was thus 36.3 billion
down on the level of the previous month.
This was attributable to a narrower trade sur-
plus and to the fact that invisible current
transactions, which comprise services, in-
come and current transfers, reverted to a
deficit.
According to provisional figures released by
the Federal Statistical Office, in April the for-
eign trade surplus went down by 33.5 billion
on the month to 313.4 billion. After adjust-
ment for seasonal and calendar variations, it
went up slightly by 30.1 billion to 313.1 bil-
lion. The value of imports declined more
significantly (-7.3%) than that of exports
(-5.9%). Compared with the first-quarter
average, seasonally adjusted nominal exports
increased by 2.2%, while imports decreased
slightly by 0.4%.
Invisible current transactions posted a deficit
of30.9 billion in April, compared with a sur-
plus of 32.4 billion in March. This stemmed
from the reduced surpluses in the income
account and in the services account. Cross-
border income rose by a mere 31.1 billion,
compared with 34.3 billion in the previous
month. Net receipts of 30.8 billion resulted in
a balanced services account in April. By con-
trast, the deficit in current transfers fell by
30.6 billion to 32.1 billion.

ment, April saw net capital exports in theMajor items of the balance

unchanged on the month. This was mainlydue to the withdrawal of funds from Ger-many by foreign portfolio investors ( 313.2 bil-
lion). As usual in the run-up to the dividendpayment dates, they sold large quantities ofGerman shares ( 333.4 billion). These dis-
posals were partly offset by purchases of debtsecurities ( 319.3 billion) which were focused
on both public and private bonds and notes(311.5 billion) as well as money market
instruments ( 37.8 billion). German investors
reduced their investment abroad by 32.0 bil-
lion. While they sold bonds and notes ( 30.6
billion) and shares ( 34.0 billion), they acquired
mutual fund shares in the amount of 32.7 bil-
lion.
Direct investment likewise recorded net out-
flows, although, at 31.2 billion, these were
very modest. This was primarily due to therepatriation of capital by foreign enterprises(31.6 billion), which mainly involved the
redemption of previously granted financialand trade credits by their resident affiliates.Investment by German proprietors abroadwas broadly stable (+ 30.4 billion). While they
withdrew funds from abroad via intra-grouploans ( 33.9 billion), they bolstered their equity
capital and reinvested earnings.
Other statistically recorded investment, com-
prising financial and trade credits (wherethese do not constitute direct investment) aswell as bank deposits and other assets, sawnet inflows again in April ( 33.2 billion, com-
pared with 33.8 billion in March). Non-banks
recorded capital outflows amounting to 38.8
billion. Enterprises and households transferredfunds abroad ( 315.5 billion), primarily in order
to increase their short-term bank deposits. Atthe same time, the activities of general gov-ernment generated capital inflows ( 36.7 bil-
lion), mainly through a decrease in foreignbank deposits. By contrast, the activities ofthe banking system led to capital imports(312.0 billion). In this context, domestic credit
institutions experienced inflows of funds fromabroad ( 315.9 billion). Conversely, the Bun-
desbank recorded capital outflows ( 33.9 bil-
lion), largely on account of an increase inclaims within the TARGET2 system.

15Outlook for the
German economy –
macroeconomic
projections for
2010 and 2011The German economy accelerated in
the second quarter of 2010, after hav-
ing temporarily lost momentum in the
fourth quarter of 2009/first quarter of
2010 largely as a result of the particu-
larly cold and snowy weather and the
end of the car scrappage premium. As
spring set in, the positive impetus
emanating from the global economy
increasingly prevailed. This impetus is
likely to set the basic tone for econom-
ic developments during the forecast-
ing period, based on the assumption
that the uncertainty which the fiscal
problems in a number of countries are
creating on the financial markets
remains limited. Real gross domestic
product (not working-day-adjusted)
could rise by 1.9% in 2010; growth is
likely to be slightly lower the follow-
ing year, at 1.4%, partly as a result of
waning fiscal stimuli. While unemploy-
ment could rise slightly, this does not
change the fact that the German
labour market can still be regarded as
extremely robust. The price outlook is
largely determined by conditions on
the international foreign exchange
and commodities markets; domestic
inflation will presumably remain
muted for the time being. Consumer
prices could rise by 1.2% this year, and
1.6% in 2011.

16Current situation
Although German economic growth fell short
of expectations in the fourth quarter of 2009/
first quarter of 2010, monthly economic
indicators point to a sharp revival in the
second quarter of 2010. The temporary
weakening of the economic recovery process
can largely be attributed to temporary
factors. Foremost are the phasing-out of the
environmental premium, which had provided
an incentive to scrap old cars and replace
them with new vehicles, and the particularly
cold and snowy winter weather, which mainly
hurt the construction industry, but also affect-
ed the transport and, indirectly, the industrial
sector. Nonetheless, the prospect of a
sustained recovery of the German economy
remains intact, as is evident from the upward
trend in sentiment indicators, the robust
labour market situation and the strong
increase in new orders received by industry
since the new year. Most were received from
abroad, initially from non-euro-area countries
and, more recently, increasingly from other
euro-area countries. Within Germany, orders
of capital goods picked up perceptibly in the
first quarter of 2010. Most are likely to have
been replacement purchases. With the excep-
tion of expenditure on new motor vehicles,
which fell more rapidly than predicted in the
December forecast, the basic trend in terms
of private consumption remained robust.
Despite sluggish real economic growth, the
labour market exceeded already optimistic
expectations. Contrary to the December fore-
cast, the official unemployment figure did not
increase; in fact, it fell perceptibly. The slightdecline in the labour force was a contributory
factor, as were policy measures aimed at the
labour market. Although job cuts continued
in manufacturing, more jobs were created by
service providers, notably in education, health
and social work. According to the informa-
tion available to date, many of these jobs are
part-time positions. Because the return to
normal working hours continued, particularly
in industry, as the economic recovery gained
momentum, the average number of hours
worked per person and the total number of
hours worked rose appreciably in seasonally
adjusted terms, while aggregate employment
remained roughly unchanged. Nonetheless,
there are still considerable staff reserves in
industry, which means that additional orders
can be filled quickly with experienced staff.
As anticipated, this year’s collective wage
negotiations focused on safeguarding jobs. In
the two largest German industries, chemicals
and metal-working, the social partners
agreed not to raise basic pay in 2010. Basic
rates of pay in the metal-working industry
will not be lifted until 2011, while the chem-
icals industry will negotiate a new collective
wage agreement in 2011. In the public sector,
central and local government employees
have agreed moderate wage increases over a
two-year period. For the economy as a
whole, effective monthly earnings rose in the
first quarter of 2010 – as anticipated in the
December forecast – after having dropped in
2009 as working hours were cut in response
to the crisis.

17well as the declining external value of the
euro. While crude oil prices, as measured in
US dollars, were initially lower than the
assumptions made in the December forecast,
which were derived from forward prices, they
subsequently temporarily surged, before
moderating at the current end. Exchange
rates were gradually affected by the uncer-
tainty spilling over from the difficult fiscal
situation in several member states to the
financial markets. As a result, the price, in
euro, of a barrel of Brent crude was signifi-
cantly higher in May 2010 than predicted in
the December forecast, although US dollar
spot prices were below the forward prices
used at the time. However, as developments
in the other main groupings of the Harmon-
ised Index of Consumer Prices were some-
what more favourable than anticipated
– partly as a result of the better measurement
of price movements for seasonal goods and
lower prices for some services – inflation
remained just below the forecast level in the
first quarter of 2010, at 0.8% year-on-year.
Inflation did not exceed expectations until
April/May, when it averaged 1.1%.
Major assumptions1
The global economy has recovered from the
worldwide economic slump experienced
around the new year 2008/2009 more quickly
than widely anticipated. The exceptionally
expansionary monetary and fiscal policy in a
number of countries as well as the effect of
the automatic stabilisers was a major factor.
Global production is likely to rise by no less
than 4% this year, driven in part by the inven-tory cycle. The fact that growth is expected to
be only slightly lower in 2011, at 31/C252%,
despite a gradual exit from non-standard
monetary policy measures, increasing fiscal
consolidation efforts and the fact that the
inventory cycle will then no longer provideEmployment patterns

1The assumptions concerning developments in global
trade, exchange rates, international commodity prices
and interest rates were determined by the Eurosystem’s
experts. They are based on the information available up

18impetus underscores the growing underlying
economic momentum. Global economic
growth is strongest in the Asian area. Several
Latin American countries are also expected to
raise value added sharply. This will benefit
exporters of commodities such as Australia
or Russia. Among industrial countries, the
United States are at the forefront of econom-
ic growth.
The recovery in global output has been ac-
companied by a perceptible revival in global
trade, which had been particularly hard hit by
the economic downturn. Although global
trade volume is likely to outpace economic
output this year and next, at 9% and 6%
respectively, the intensity of global trade
would even then remain below pre-crisis
levels. Although regional growth differentials
mean German industry’s traditional sales
markets are likely to achieve below-average
growth, at 63/C254% and 41/C252% respectively, they
are nonetheless expected to grow more
strongly than assumed in the December
projection, particularly in 2010.
Over the forecasting horizon, the probably
short-term dampening effect on the euro
area of the additional fiscal consolidation
efforts which a number of countries will be
forced to make could be mitigated by the
depreciation of the euro. However, the price
component as a factor determining exports
should not be overrated where Germany is
concerned. The forecast presented here is
based on the technical assumption of a con-
stant euro/dollar exchange rate of US$1.26;
that is 151/C252% less than stated in the Decem-
ber projection. Compared to the 21 mostimportant euro-area trading partners, the
single currency is seen 113/C254% lower than had
been assumed in December.
The latest spot and forward prices for crude
oil and other commodities as measured in US
dollars are largely in line with the expect-
ations outlined in the December forecast,
which were derived from forward prices in
November 2009. The average price of a barrel
of crude oil is assumed to be US$79.5 in
2010 and US$83.7 in 2011, after US$61.9 in
2009. This equates to a rise of 281/C252%a n d
51/C254% respectively. Other commodity prices
are seen appreciating by 18% on average in
2010. By the first quarter of 2010, industrial
commodities prices, in particular, had almost
recouped their recession-induced price losses.
According to forward prices, prices should
not increase much more in 2011 (+11/C254%).
The assumed marked depreciation of the
euro means crude oil and commodity prices
will presumably rise much more steeply in
Germany than on the global markets.
Given the ongoing uncertainty on the finan-
cial markets and the sluggish economic
recovery in the euro area, the Eurosystem’s
monetary policy remains extremely expan-
sionary and will, the financial markets believe,
remain so for longer than previously antici-
pated. Interest rate assumptions, which are
derived from market data, therefore predict
that the short-term lending rate (three-month
Euribor) will be lower again this year, at
0.8%, than last year. An only slightly higher
short-term interest rate of 1.1% is now
assumed for 2011, compared with 2.4% in
the December forecast. The yield on long-Significant

19term German government bonds outstanding
is likely to moderate to 3.0% this year andrise to just 3.4% next year. The Decemberforecast had assumed a figure of 4.1% for2011. As in previous projections, interest ratespreads on loans to enterprises were used togauge the likely effects of the financial crisison enterprises’ borrowing. These spreads,too, have narrowed slightly compared to thelast forecast. The finding of the Bank LendingSurvey that credit standards have hardly beentightened in the last six months was likewisefactored into the corporate financing projec-tion. The Ifo credit crunch indicator was evensignalling a slight easing as this report wentto press. It is therefore assumed that finan-cing conditions for enterprises will graduallyimprove over the forecasting horizon.
In public finances, all measures are taken into
consideration which have either been adopt-ed or which have already been specified insufficient detail and are likely to be approved.The measures in connection with the settingof the Federal budget for 2011 that wereannounced after the cut-off date of theprojection were therefore not taken into ac-count. The economic support measures im-plemented since the onset of the financialand economic crisis are particularly relevant.On top of tax relief in relation to the crisis(mainly lower income tax rates and corporatetaxation), there will also be a considerableshortfall from higher tax allowances forcontributions to the health and long-termcare insurance schemes from 2010. In termsof social contributions, the rate of contribu-tion to the health insurance fund will de-crease this year on average. On the otherhand, however, the statutory health insurers
started levying additional contributions, andthere was a one-off increase in the insolvencyinsurance premiums employers pay to theFederal Employment Agency. Next year, theincrease in the contribution rate to theFederal Employment Agency to 3.0% at thebeginning of the year as well as additionalcontributions to the statutory health insurersshould generate additional revenues on alarge scale. As regards spending, governmentinvestment, in particular, will rise appreciablythis year as a result of the fiscal stimulus pack-ages.

the government support measures for finan-

they will initially be reflected mainly in debt

Cyclical outlook3
The second and third quarters of 2010 will be
dominated by catching-up effects in con-
struction and industry. Given the good orders
situation it is assumed that the construction
industry will rapidly make up for the weather-
related output losses at the beginning of the
year. Industrial output is soon likely to catch
up with rising orders. A strong boost to
growth is therefore expected for the second
quarter of 2010. In the third quarter, the
positive underlying momentum could allow
higher economic output at least to be main-
tained, although catching-up effects in con-
struction are likely to have run their course by
then. Provided the impact of the fiscal
problems in a number of industrial countries
on confidence remains limited, the cyclical
upswing of the German economy should
continue at a moderate pace thereafter.
The main driving force for the German
economy will be the recovery of the global
economy. Global growth is strongest in
regions that do not traditionally constitute
German enterprises’ main sales markets, and
the euro area could presumably lag behind
global developments for some time to come,
not least given the urgent need for fiscal con-solidation. Nonetheless, it can be assumed
that German exporters will increasingly ex-
pand into the South-East Asian growth
markets in which they have gained a foothold
in recent years. The same is also true of
Germany’s central and east European partner
countries. Moreover, global demand will
again focus more and more on the higher-
quality capital goods in which German
exporters specialise. In 2010, exports of
goods and services are therefore likely to
experience fairly strong growth of 81/C252%. For
2011, growth is forecast to come in at 51/C254%
as global economic growth is expected to be
somewhat weaker. The export volume in
2011 would thus still not quite match that of
2008.
Domestic economic developments will con-
tinue to be dominated by the impact of fiscal
stimuli in 2010. Private motor vehicle registra-
tions will be decidedly lower as the environ-
mental premium for scrapping old cars meant
many purchases were brought forward to
2009. However, the tax relief granted at the
beginning of the year should support private
consumption, and the public sector invest-
ment triggered by the fiscal stimulus pro-
grammes is likely to provide the construction
industry with additional impetus. In 2011,
however, public sector construction demand
is likely to contract sharply, and overall tax
and social security offtakes should rise. As
a consequence, inflation-adjusted domestic

21demand is expected to rise by just 1%, after
+11/C252% this year.
Given the various fiscal determinants in 2010,
private consumption is likely to decline in realterms, although this is more a reflection of“withdrawal effects” stemming from thediscontinuation of the environmental pre-mium than the underlying cyclical trend. Thesavings ratio will probably go up to 11
1/C252%
this year compared with the 2009 level,which was influenced by this special factor.A slight decline is expected for 2011 since thetrend rise in the savings ratio is unlikely tocontinue, at least for the time being. Overall,private consumption could go down by justunder 1% this year in price-adjusted termsbut make this up again in the following year.
Corporate investment will pick up gradually.
The focus initially is likely to be on investmentin replacements which can no longer be de-ferred as well as on expenditure in connectionwith the introduction of new products. Inview of a high degree of price competitive-ness and unused capacity, neither rationalisa-tion nor capacity expansion are likely to figureprominently as motives for investment atpresent. Private residential construction mightbenefit not only from low interest rates butalso from the heightened uncertainty regard-ing alternative forms of investment. Publicinvestment will go up probably by somethinglike one-quarter in the current year as a resultof the economic stimulus packages andcontract by the same amount in 2011. Therise in public investment will be the mainreason for the marked increase in the overallvolume of investment in 2010. The currentprojection assumes an increase of 4%. In
2011, owing to the assumed acceleratedpace of private fixed capital formation, lastyear’s level should be maintained despite theforeseeable marked decline in public invest-ment spending.
Inventories will probably generate strong
expansionary impulses this year, which willlargely offset last year’s negative contribution.Aggregate output

22First, stocks of raw materials and inputs are
being built up again. Second, the reduction
of excessive stocks of finished goods appears
to have come to an end. Inventory invest-
ment may be expected to make a roughly
neutral contribution in 2011.
As it is specialised in high-quality finished
goods, the German economy is dependent
on an increased supply of raw materials,
semi-finished goods and components for ex-
panding its sales. For that reason alone,
imports should increase sharply over the fore-
casting horizon. Capital goods, too, will be
imported on a considerable scale, especially
in the IT sector. Furthermore, imports account
– directly or indirectly – for a large part of
households’ spending. The increase in imports
of goods and services, at 8% in 2010 and5% in 2011, will therefore probably be hardly
any smaller than the rise in exports. The
current account surplus, accompanied by
matching net capital exports, could remain
unchanged at not quite 5% of GDP . This
would be due to a nominal net trade contri-
bution to growth of 0.5 percentage point in
2010 and 0.4 percentage point in 2011.
Economic output in Germany could increase
overall by 1.9% in 2010 (not working-day-
adjusted). At 1.4%, the increase is likely to be
somewhat smaller in 2011, although this
slight slowdown will be due more to waning
stimuli from public finances and inventories
than to an easing of the underlying pace of
growth in the economy. Adjusted for the
differing number of working days, this would
give 1.8% in 2010 and 1.5% in 2011. Com-
pared with the December 2009 projection,
this results in an upward correction of 0.3
percentage point for 2010 and 0.2 percent-
age point for 2011. Despite considerable
cyclical progress, this will not yet quite match
the pre-crisis level of output.
At an average of more than 11/C252% annually,
growth in economic output over the forecast-
ing horizon is likely to be roughly twice as
high as potential growth, which model
calculations put at3/C254% per year.4This is likely
to close quite a bit, but not yet all of the

wake of the sharp contraction in the German

23first quarter of 2009. These statements are
subject to the caveat that unobservablevariables, such as potential growth and theoutput gap, are very difficult to gauge in realtime, especially in times of major economicupheavals and uncertainties.
Given the expected upswing in the German
economy in the second and third quarters of2010, it is unlikely that enterprises will nowmake any lay-offs that they have not under-taken so far on a significant scale, eventhough there are still major levels of overstaff-ing. For some months now, leading short-term labour market indicators, such as theBA-X index for job vacancies and the Ifoemployment barometer, have been showingthat the situation on the labour is becomingincreasingly brighter. Even though the transi-tion from contractionary to expansionaryterritory cannot be defined precisely, theseindicators provide a clear sign that thereshould be a slowing of job losses in trade andindustry. Much the same is suggested by theinflux of jobseekers who are not (yet) un-employed, which remains at a comparativelylow level. Keeping on workers is being madeeasier for enterprises owing to the specialregulations for short-time working benefitsbeing extended up to the end of March 2012and the supplementary collective pay agree-ments which allow further reductions in regu-lar weekly working hours.
Against this backdrop, the current projection
assumes that the shedding of jobs in industrywill gradually decelerate but that, not leastowing to the need for fiscal consolidation,fewer new jobs will be created by public andKey figures of the macroeconomic

24private service providers. As a result, there
could be a slight decline in overall employ-
ment. Working hours are likely to return
gradually to normal. In both years of the fore-
casting horizon, the domestic supply of
labour will be restricted only moderately by
demographic factors. With regard to labour
market participation, it is assumed that it will
persist at the heightened level of 2009.5
Allowing complete free movement for work-
ers from the central and east European acces-
sion countries from May 2011 is likely to be
reflected initially, above all, in the commuter
balance, which already showed a clear rise in
2009 after certain regulations for seasonal
workers were relaxed. Given these condi-
tions, unemployment would increase slightly
over the forecasting horizon. The unemploy-
ment rate could go up to 8.0%. A rise to
more than 10% in 2011 was still assumed in
the December projection.
Labour costs and price outlook
The rise in negotiated rates of pay should
remain within comparatively narrow bounds
in the immediate future. In 2010, for which
collective pay agreements have mostly been
concluded, the increase will amount to
roughly 11/C252%, and it is unlikely to be much
higher in 2011 either. The wage drift, calcu-
lated on an hourly basis, was positive last
year mainly as a result of working hours
being reduced through running down flexi-
time accounts and the use of short-time
working. It is likely to turn negative. The rates
of change in actual hourly wages, at -1/C252%i n
2010 and +11/C254% in 2011, will thereforeprobably lag behind the rise in negotiated
rates of pay. The fact that working hours are
expected to return gradually to normal
should largely offset this effect on a monthly
basis. Changes to employers’ social contri-
butions are also foreseeable. As these are
likely to have a more or less neutral effect on
balance, compensation per employee and
hour worked could, following a decline of
1/C254% in 2010, increase by 11/C254% next year.
Given an assumed increase in hourly product-
ivity of1/C252% in 2010 and almost 11/C252%i n
2011, unit labour costs would then go down
somewhat but without offsetting the sharp
rise in 2008-09. Profit margins are likely to
recover noticeably, especially in the current
year; a further improvement is assumed for
2011, although this, too, will still fail to
match pre-crisis levels. The deflator of domes-
tic production could go up by more than1/C252%
per year.
Consumer price inflation will rise sharply from
2009 to 2010, chiefly owing to higher euro
prices for energy and food, which showed a
marked decline from the third quarter of
2008 well into the final quarter of 2009. The
prices of other goods and services are track-
ing these movements with a time lag and
with a clearly reduced amplitude. While
– mainly energy but also food – prices will go
5In contrast to earlier economic downturns, there has
been no slackening of the propensity to participate in the
labour force recently. This is probably due mainly to the
fact that the formerly popular option of early retirement
is largely unavailable. Moreover, the requirements profile
of the new jobs in social services also appeals to women
who have previously not actively been seeking work or
who have been discouraged by failing to gain employ-
ment. This “mobilisation effect”, atypically for the
current economic situation, has driven up labour market
participation.Moderate rise

25up again this year following a decline in
2009, the rate of price increase for other
goods and services will still show a marked
fall. The improved cyclical setting and the
depreciation of the euro mean that the core
components are likely to come under strong-
er upward price pressure next year. Despite
the expected moderate rise in crude oil prices,
much the same applies to energy since
experience shows that price developments in
crude oil products have a lagged impact on
gas prices and the shared costs of amenities.
The rate of inflation could be 1.2% in 2010
and 1.6% in 2011 on an annual average.
Public finances6
The government deficit ratio, which went up
to 3.1% in 2009, will rise considerably in the
current year, but probably remain below 5%.
Despite higher-than-trend GDP growth, cyc-
lical factors are of minor importance with
regard to the change in the deficit as major
macroeconomic reference variables for public
finances (gross wages and salaries, private
consumption) are rising less sharply.7The
deterioration is due, first and foremost, to
fiscal policy measures, chief among which are
the various, mostly permanent tax relief
measures and the temporary expansion of
investment as part of the fiscal stimulus pack-
ages. Added to this are high increases in
spending, mainly on health services. How-
ever, pension expenditure, for example, is
also rising relatively strongly following the
high pension increase in 2009 and on ac-
count of waived pension cuts in the current
year. By contrast, the one-off proceeds fromthe auction of mobile telephone licences as
well as the temporary increase in insolvency
insurance premiums will have an alleviating
effect. The debt ratio, which already jumped

26to support measures for financial institutions,
will show a further marked increase.8
There are signs that there will be a decline in
the government deficit to a figure in the
order of 4% in the coming year. Although the
cited alleviating effects will not be repeated,
various fiscal support measures will be discon-
tinued. In particular, it is assumed that invest-
ment will decline significantly from the
relatively high 2010 level and that budget
management will be restrained overall.
Furthermore, as things stand at present, a
slightly positive cyclical influence on the
deficit is to be expected. The debt ratio will
nevertheless increase significantly, mainly
owing to the sizeable deficit. In the following
years, the deficit ratio could still go down
somewhat as a result of some support meas-
ures being phased out and a continuing
economic recovery, but the debt ratio would
from today’s perspective go on rising from its
already high level. All in all, extensive per-
manent tax-relief measures and spending in-
creases have been adopted since the onset of
the crisis, and the scope for expenditure has
become narrower owing to the GDP trend,
which has now been revised downwards. This
means that considerable additional consolida-
tion efforts are necessary in order to meet
the medium-term budgetary objectives in line
with the national and international budgetary
rules. In this context, note should also be
taken of the high degree of uncertainty with
regard to additional burdens stemming from
support measures in the wake of the crisis.Risk assessment
The exceptionally expansionary monetary
policy, the measures to support the financial
markets, the expansive fiscal policy in many
countries and the effect of the automatic
stabilisers have been major factors in the
rapid stabilisation and incipient recovery of
the global economy. The strain this imposes
on public finances has itself now become a
source of uncertainty in some countries,
which is having a knock-on effect on the
financial markets and threatens to hurt the
real economy. The baseline scenario in this
forecast is that the negative confidence
effects of the considerable deterioration in
public finances in a number of euro-area and
non-euro-area partner countries, particularly
for the financial markets, will be limited. In
the main, this presupposes that credible
measures for sustained fiscal consolidation
are taken. Although this could, in individual
cases, have restrictive effects which are not
yet discounted in this forecast, these risks
appear less serious than the massive confi-
dence effects that could occur if there is no
consolidation or consolidation is considered
insufficient.
Looking beyond these particular imponder-
ables, a close eye must be kept on other risks.
Currently, enterprises are very confident
about the future as is evident in the stable

support measures for the financial sector in 2010, al-
though Eurostat has not yet made a definitive decision
on how they will be recorded. While the vast majority of
the measures already known for 2010 will probably have
an only minor impact on the national accounts deficit,
they could considerably increase the level of government

27labour market situation. This optimism is
based mainly on the fact that the Germaneconomy is now structurally fairly well placedafter the, at times painful, adjustment pro-cess and the associated structural reforms inthe first half of the decade. It is thereforeconceivable that German exporters couldbenefit more from the global recovery, whichmight itself be somewhat stronger than fore-cast here, than assumed in the baseline scen-ario. This would provide domestic demandwith an additional stimulus, particularly asfinancing constraints are likely to ease. Fromthis perspective, economic growth in Ger-many could exceed these forecasts this yearand next, which would also benefit thelabour market.
As regards consumer prices, the risks over the
next two years are likely to depend mainly ondevelopments in the international marketsand on exchange rates. The steep rise incrude oil prices was recently interrupted by apronounced downward correction, which hasnot been fully incorporated into theseforecast assumptions. However, expectedglobal economic growth is likely to boost de-mand for commodities, which could triggerstronger price increases than currently dis-counted in forward prices if supply provesinelastic. If price pressure increases andmedium-term inflation expectations, whichhave to date been anchored at a low level,deteriorate, this would have a knock-oneffect on wage negotiations and could itselfcause higher prices. In the short term, the
risks to price stability are therefore more likelyto be to the downside, while potential upsiderisks dominate in the longer term. However,the latter should not have much impact onthe figures for 2011.Baseline and uncertainty

29Uncertainty of
macroeconomic
forecastsIn 2007, the Bundesbank began pub-
lishing its forecasts on the future
economic development of Germany – a
procedure that an increasing number
of other central banks have also adopt-
ed for their own domestic economies.
In these macroeconomic forecasts, the
central banks often go beyond provid-
ing mere point predictions by also
giving an indication of how uncertain
the predictions are themselves. The
scale of a forecast’s uncertainty is an
important piece of information for
addressees in its own right, especially if
the predictions are to be used as the
basis for policy decisions.
The forecast uncertainty itself, how-
ever, is also not known and has to be
estimated. Compared with simple fore-
cast models, the uncertainty in Bundes-
bank forecasts is relatively small and
similar to that of other institutions.
That said, the unexpectedly steep drop
in gross domestic product observed
during the recent financial crisis has
led to a conspicuous rise in forecast
uncertainty estimates for the future.
Since then, the possibility that extreme
events could occur has had a markedly
higher probability than it did prior to
the crisis.

30Introductory statement
Economics staff at the European Central Bank
and the national central banks of the euro
area produce semi-annual macroeconomic
projections which the Governing Council uses
as a basis for monetary policy decisions. The
macroeconomic forecasts on the German
economy, which the Bundesbank produces in
this context, have been published since De-
cember 2007.1
Aside from its point predictions, the Bundes-
bank also publishes margins of uncertainty
for those variables that are of the greatest
public interest, namely rates of change in
the real gross domestic product (GDP) and
the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices
(HICP).2Other central banks also release
regular information on forecast uncertainty.
The ECB refrains from publishing point fore-
casts, but instead provides ranges for the ex-
pected future rates of change in GDP , in its
components and in the HICP . The width of
these ranges reflects the scale of the forecast
uncertainty.
Information about forecast uncertainty is
important in many ways with regard to the
expectations and actions of participants in
economic activity. The risk premiums of
nominal bonds, for example, are aligned
with, among other things, the scale of uncer-
tainty associated with expected inflation rates
in the future. The greater the uncertainty, the
higher the risk premiums demanded by risk-
averse investors. Indications of forecast un-
certainty also plays an important role in many
other economic decision-making processes. Ifcentral banks want to rule out future defla-
tionary developments to a high level of
probability, for example, they require infor-
mation about the uncertainty of the inflation
forecasts. The same is true of GDP forecasts
for fiscal policy-makers if they want to avoid
exceeding a certain deficit ratio, for instance.
Overall, it is clear that the ability to determine
the level of uncertainty in future develop-
ments can affect economic decision-making
in many respects.
Causes of forecast uncertainty, concepts
for their measurement and forms of
representation
Forecasts are generated using statistical
models – either implicitly or explicitly.3The
forecast values are determined by the model
structure and its parameters, as well as by
past and future values for different variables.
The latter can be sub-divided into endogen-
ous and exogenous variables, as well as
disturbance terms. Endogenous variables are
described within the model while exogenous
variables influence the result “from the out-
side”, so they must first be forecast them-

the German economy: macroeconomic projections for

the GDP assessments that follow also refer to the real,

31selves before the models can be used to
generate predictions.4
Based on these considerations, five principalcauses of forecast uncertainty can be identi-fied: data uncertainty, parameter uncertainty,future disturbances’ uncertainty (shocks),future exogenous variables’ uncertainty andmodel uncertainty.
Data uncertainty exists if the observed
variables contain measurement errors. Thefirst publications of the national accounts,which are of great importance for the fore-cast, are still partly based on estimates, forexample, and are often revised during thesubsequent quarters. The values used for theprediction therefore frequently differ fromthe actual data.
Parameter uncertainty is predominantly influ-
enced by the size of the sample available forestimating the model, ie from the length ofthe available time series. The longer the timeseries are, the lower the parameter uncer-tainty usually is. This is not the case, however,if parameter values change over time.
As every model is merely an approximation of
reality, it also contains unpredictable disturb-ance terms whose realisations are unforesee-able at the time of the forecast. One suchexample would be a surprisingly cold winter,causing unpredictable output disruptions.The future development of model-exogenousvariables that are assumed in the forecast,such as the price of oil, is also uncertain andin most cases deviates from the actualdevelopment.Finally, there is model uncertainty, and it is
uncertain whether the model used for theprediction correctly captures the economicrelationships.
Assessing the scale of each factor’s influence
on forecast uncertainty is a difficult task, andquantifying model uncertainty is particularlydifficult. If a model is given, however, then– conditional on that model – the effects ofdata and parameter uncertainty, futureshocks and uncertainty regarding the futuredevelopment of model-exogenous variablescan be estimated in principle. To be able totake the uncertainty of the future develop-ments of model-exogenous variables anddata uncertainty into consideration, othermodels must first be set up to predict themodel-exogenous variables and estimate thedata, and then have to be integrated into themain model for estimating forecast uncer-tainty. The forecast uncertainty of this modelcan then be analysed using stochastic simu-lations.
5Such simulations provide a large
sample of predicted values which are seen asrealisations of random variables, the distri-bution of which can be used to calculatemeasures of forecast uncertainty .
A model-based estimate of forecast uncer-
tainty therefore requires a considerable
4To generate inflation rate forecasts, model-endogenous
variables to be considered are, for example, present and
past inflation rates, as well as in larger models, the
current values of wages, monetary aggregates or cap-
acity utilisation. The price of oil or the level of VAT, for ex-
ample, are likely to be treated as model-exogenous
variables whose future values have to be forecast outside
of the model, and in certain circumstances with the help
of another model.

32amount of effort. Another problem is that in
most cases, forecasts are not solely model-
based, but also rely on information from out-
side the model. This includes data which are
available earlier and are sampled with higher
frequency than the model data. A model-
based assessment of forecast accuracy can
therefore, primarily in the short term, at best
provide approximate results. Against this
backdrop, it is not surprising that model-
based estimates of forecast uncertainty are
only of limited importance in practice.
A much simpler estimate of uncertainty can
be calculated using past forecast errors. This
implicitly takes account of all uncertainty
sources that have contributed to the devi-
ations between realised values and the fore-
cast values. Using past forecast errors,
measures of dispersion can be estimated and
used as a yardstick for the uncertainty levels
of current projections. Popular estimated
measures of dispersion are the mean absolute
error (MAE) of forecasts or the root mean
squared error (RMSE).6
One problem with using this method can be
that only a few forecast errors are available
for the required estimates. In this case, the
precision of the estimates is low.7Further-
more, the empirical measures of dispersion
can be non-monotonic over the forecast
horizons, whereas it is generally expected
that forecast uncertainty increases with the
forecast horizon. The empirical measures of
dispersion are therefore sometimes smoothed
over the horizons so as to present a plausible
picture of forecast uncertainty.A third solution is to make use of surveys,
whereby the questions are either focussed
directly on the dispersion measure of interest,
or the (divergent) point predictions are evalu-
ated for individuals or institutions. Central
banks sometimes use the various estimates
within their decision-making bodies in this
context. An assessment of uncertainty can be
made by examining to what degree the point
predictions deviate from one another. Under
certain circumstances, such an estimate may,
however, prove unsuitable for making prob-
ability statements. If, for example, all re-
spondents are expecting an inflation rate of
around 2% in the long term, but each one of
them is very unsure about their own predic-
tion, a judgement based solely on point pre-
dictions would come to the conclusion that
the uncertainty for long-term forecasts of the
inflation rate is very low. In actual fact, a size-
able deviation of the long-term inflation rate
from 2% is not unlikely in this case according
to those interviewed. Nevertheless, the dis-
persion of point predictions can provide im-
portant information, especially about possible

33changes to the forecast uncertainty over
time.8
In addition, the aforementioned survey-basedmethods can be combined by surveyingindividuals or institutions on both their pointand uncertainty predictions, or on the prob-abilities for specific ranges of the variable inquestion. An aggregated forecast uncertaintycan then be calculated from this information,which takes into account the differencesbetween the point predictions as well as theuncertainty of each respondent.
The methods stated are not mutually exclu-
sive. An estimate based on forecast errors, forexample, can generally produce a quite reli-able assessment of past forecast uncertainty.If the surveys show that the respondentsbelieve current uncertainty to be considerablyhigher than past uncertainty, however, theestimate can be adjusted accordingly.
9In
actual fact, several representations of forecastuncertainties are based on hybrid forms ofthe approaches described here.
All current forecast uncertainty estimates are
ultimately based on uncertainty that has beenobserved in the past. This becomes especiallyclear when using past forecast errors, but it isalso the case when using model-basedmethods and even, implicitly or explicitly,with survey-based methods.
10For this reason,
a reliable estimate of the current forecastuncertainty can only be achieved if the fore-cast uncertainty does not vary too greatlyover time.Various alternatives are available not only
when measuring but also when representingforecast uncertainty. The choice of represen-tation depends on the forecast character-istics, the type of forecast uncertaintymeasurement used and the scope of theinformation to be conveyed. A forecast ofmany monthly values warrants a differenttype of representation than the forecast of asingle annual value, for example. And asurvey-based measurement of uncertaintycan require a different representation than amodel-based measurement.
Central banks often use fan charts of the
type first published by the Bank of England in1996. Often in these charts, a certain prob-ability is given that is covered by each individ-ual fan section. The charts illustrate that fore-casts are uncertain and that values close tothe point predictions, ie values in the middleof the chart, are more probable than thosethat lie further from the point predictions.
11It
also becomes clear that forecast uncertaintyrises in line with the forecast horizon.

to overestimate forecast uncertainty. See E M Leeper

34Fan charts are well-suited for representing
forecast uncertainty over many consecutive
periods. If the prediction uncertainty is only
required for a few specific points in time, a
histogram or a probability density can be
shown, for example.12
Overview of central banks’ approaches
In practice, central banks that publish fore-
cast uncertainty measures use a wide range
of estimation procedures and representation
methods (see table on page 35). Partly these
procedures can be identified as one of the
methods presented here and partly they are a
result of combinations. Measures of uncer-
tainty based on past forecast errors play a
major role for many central banks.
The uncertainty estimates for ECB and ESCB
staff projections are based on past forecast
errors. Especially large forecast errors are
seen as outliers, however, and are excluded
from the sample. The mean absolute forecast
errors are calculated from the remaining fore-
cast errors. The width of the forecast ranges
for the annual forecasts, which are published
in a table, is twice that of the absolute error.
The ECB states that the probability of a real-
isation within such a range is 57.5%.13This is
in line with a normal (Gaussian) distribution
of errors (corrected for outliers).
The Bundesbank’s uncertainty forecasts are
also based on the mean absolute error of past
forecasts and relate to quarterly periods. As
no distribution assumption is made for the
forecast errors, as in the case of the ECB, noexplicit probability statements are implied by
the published fan charts. They can be derived,
however, if a certain distribution is assumed,
as in the case of the ECB’s euro-area projec-
tion.14
The Sveriges Riksbank publishes fan charts
whose width is determined by the root mean
squared forecast error. A normal distribution
is assumed for the forecast errors.15The
Sveriges Riksbank forecasts quarterly values.
Model-based uncertainty forecasts, for ex-
ample, are used by the Norges Bank (central
bank of Norway). One of the reasons why
past forecast errors are not used is that, in the
available sample, they had been extraordinar-
ily large due to special factors for one of the
forecast variables, namely the three-month
money market rate.16The available sample
was considered too small for accurate esti-
mates of the forecast uncertainty. It is as-
12A histogram can be useful if the uncertainty forecast
is based on surveys that focus on probabilities for specific
ranges of the variable under scrutiny. A probability
density is appropriate if an assumption is made about the
distribution of forecast errors.
13See European Central Bank, New procedure for con-
structing Eurosystem and ECB staff projection ranges,
December 2009, http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/other/new-
procedureforprojections200912en.pdf.
14A fan chart width of twice the mean absolute error
corresponds with a probability of 57.5%, for example,
and a width of one mean absolute error with a probabil-
ity of 31% if the forecast errors are normally distributed.
If a different distribution is assumed, as a rule, additional
assumptions about other distribution parameters must
initially be made. The assumption of a normal distribution
is often used for macroeconomic forecast errors. The

At the Bank of Japan the Policy Board
members’ estimates are key.17The members
provide histograms of their own forecastprobabilities. The highest value (mode) insuch a histogram is also the point predictionof that particular member. These histogramsare then aggregated by calculating the aver-age of the corresponding values for eachrange in all histograms.
18The dispersion in
the published aggregated histograms is there-by influenced by the differences in the pointpredictions as well as by the uncertainty ofeach Policy Board member. The forecastsrefer to annual values.

36members on whether the current forecast
uncertainty is greater, smaller or roughly the
same in comparison to the past. The probabil-
ity of a realisation within a range that is as
wide as twice the root mean squared error
(set by a FOMC member’s forecast) is around
70%.21Furthermore, box-plots and histo-
grams reflect the FOMC members’ various
point predictions.
The Bank of England initially calculates the
root mean squared errors using forecast
errors over the last 10 years.22On the basis of
this value, the MPC members23agree on the
width of the fan chart into which their esti-
mates on the current forecast uncertainty are
entered. Explicit probability statements can
then be implied from the fan chart for quar-
terly projections and the underlying probabil-
ity distributions, whose parameters are also
published by the Bank of England. The Bank
of England’s approach has been adopted by
several other institutions, in some cases with
slight modifications.24
The Bank of Canada takes account of infor-
mation from past forecast errors as well as
model-based uncertainty measures. The un-
certainty calculated from past forecast errors
is used for the first two forecast quarters,
while the uncertainty is derived from a model
for additional forecast horizons, whereby the
lagged effects of the forecast errors for the
first two quarters are also included.25The rea-
son is that the model forecast for the near fu-
ture is modified relatively strongly by exogen-
ous information, which plays a smaller role in
the medium and long term. It is assumed that
the forecast errors are normally distributed.Bundesbank forecast uncertainty
The Bundesbank’s forecast uncertainty calcu-
lation is based on actual errors made by the
Bundesbank for Germany in the Eurosystem’s
macroeconomic staff projections. For these
forecasts, joint estimates are made for all
national central bank and ECB forecasts for
the development of important exogenous
variables, such as the price of oil, exchange
rates and interest rates – with interest rates
being of particular importance.
For central banks the treatment of current
interest rate developments and interest rate
developments expected in the future is of
particular importance in their forecasts. First-
ly, the short-term interest rates are the main
monetary policy instrument for achieving
primary monetary policy objectives. Secondly,
monetary policy has a considerable effect on
future interest rate expectations through
changes in the current short-term interest
rate and the manner in which they are com-
municated. In this context, the way in which
the expected short-term interest rate is fac-
tored into central banks’ own forecasts is
extremely complex. There has been a major
change in this area within the Eurosystem

37over the past few years. Until spring 2006,
the forecasts were based on the assumptionthat interest rates would remain constant inthe future. Since then, the interest rates ex-pected by market players (market interestrates) have been used. In both cases, the fore-casts can be seen as projections conditionalon a specific interest rate path. The aim ofthe forecast, therefore, is not to determinethe best-possible unconditional estimate offuture developments, but rather to find thebest-possible estimate subject to the condi-tion that interest rates follow the assumedcourse.
26Forecast deviations from the actual
development that result from an interest ratedevelopment other than that assumed can-not therefore merely be seen as a sign ofpoor forecast performance.
27
The 2006 change in the assumptions regard-ing interest rates has consequences for fore-cast uncertainty. Generally the long-terminflation forecast will roughly adopt the valueaimed for by the central bank if market inter-est rates and the incorporated future interestrate expectations are used for the forecastand assuming the central bank has credibilitywith regard to achieving its objective. By con-trast, if constant interest rates are assumed,the associated long-term inflation forecastcan deviate more strongly from the centralbank’s target inflation rate and/or from theactually realised inflation rate. Correspond-ingly, errors in the long-term inflation forecastwhen using market interest rates should besmaller on average than when using constantinterest rates. This is presumably less valid inthe short term, as assuming unchanged inter-est rates for such a period can prove moreoften to be accurate and as interest rate
changes only have a small effect on growthand prices in the short term.
Owing to the fact that this procedure was
only introduced in the Eurosystem in 2006,market interest rates have only been used ineight forecasts so far. A reliable estimate offorecast uncertainty is not possible with sucha small sample. The current estimate for theentire period from spring 1999 to autumn2009 is therefore based on a total of 22 fore-casts, meaning that the forecast uncertaintycalculated in this way probably tends to beoverstated.
To calculate the forecast errors, the corres-
ponding realisations are also required in add-ition to the forecasts themselves, and theirvalues are repeatedly revised by statisticaloffices. Revisions may be induced by newdata or the use of new data measurementconcepts. Thus, the first release of GDP datafor the preceding quarter generally deviatesfrom the next publication for the sameperiod. Furthermore, methodological changesin data acquisition or evaluation can also leadto changes long after the publication date.
26If the forecast variables deviate from the monetary
policy target, this generally indicates a need for monetary
policy action. Until 2006 this meant that the interest
rates should not remain at their prevailing levels. After
2006, deviations from the monetary policy target would
imply that interest rates should take a different course
from that expected by market players.
27For exchange rates, the technical assumption is that
during the forecast period they should remain at the level
observed at the time the forecast was generated. Thus,
the forecasts are also conditioned on the corresponding
exchange rate paths. The quality of the forecasts could
be noticeably affected by the rule applicable for Euro-
system forecasts permitting consideration solely of fiscal
policy measures for which either the legislative procedure
has been completed or which have been sufficiently
specified and are likely to be adopted.... with conse-

38Deutsche BundesbankUncertainty of Bundesbank forecasts – a comparison
It is generally desirable that forecasts are as accu-
rate and precise as possible. Therefore, the lower 
the level of uncertainty of a forecast, the better it is 
thought to be. When comparing a number of differ-
ent forecasts, however, it is essential to ensure that 
the forecast environments are identical. This includes 
ensuring that the respective forecasts are based on 
the same information set and, hence, that the fore-
casts are generated at the same time. Furthermore, 
conditional forecasts should, as far as possible, be 
compared with other forecasts which are subject to 
the same conditions. Finally, forecasts should relate 
to the same or at least very similar variables. In the 
following, every effort has been made to ensure that 
these conditions are met as far as possible. Neverthe-
less, the Bundesbank forecasts which are conditional 
on a certain interest rate path are compared with 
unconditional forecasts.
The uncertainty of the forecasts is considered for the 
quarterly year-on-year growth rates of the Harmo-
nised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) and the real sea-
sonally and calendar adjusted gross domestic product 
(GDP). The Bundesbank forecasts are compared with 
two simple forecast models, which often have fairly 
good predictive properties, however. In addition, they 
are compared with the Consensus forecasts in which 
a large number of individual forecasts are combined.1 
The accuracy of combined forecasts is generally high 
and superior to that of most individual forecasts. The 
mean absolute error (MAE) is used as the measure of 
uncertainty. Quarterly forecasts compiled on a semi-
annual basis in the period from the second quarter of 
1999 to the fourth quarter of 2009 are examined.2A random walk (RW) model and a ﬁ  rst-order autore-
gressive (AR(1)) model are used as simple alterna-
tive models. Where the relevant variable at time t is 
denoted by yt and the forecast of the variable at time 
t+h is denoted by ŷt+h and T-1 is the last period during 
which the variable was observed, then the forecasts 
for the RW model are given by
ŷT+h = yT-1
and the forecasts for the AR(1) model by
ŷT+h = c + ρŷT+h-1 = ρh+1yT-1 + c∑h
i=0 ρi  , h= 0, 1, 2, ...
whereby ρ is the autoregressive coefﬁ  cient and c is 
the constant of the AR(1) model which have to be 
estimated.3 In the following comparison of forecast 
uncertainty, the quarter prior to the forecast being 
prepared is used as the time period T-1.4 The forecast 
must also be prepared for the current period T, with 
the result that h takes the value “zero” for the fore-
cast of this quarter.5 This forecast is referred to as a 
zero-step forecast. Such a forecast is necessary as the 
current quarterly value of the relevant variables is not 
yet known at the time that the forecast is prepared.
The MAE of the various forecasts for the annual HICP 
rate can be seen in the chart on page 39. In the short 
term, the Bundesbank forecast performs considerably 
better than that of the simple models, whereas in the 
case of longer-term forecast horizons of up to eight 
quarters, the differences become smaller or even 
disappear.
In the short term, the Consensus forecast entails 
roughly the same degree of uncertainty as the

Inc. The combination of the individual forecasts is derived by calculating 
the average. — 2 The realisations used to calculate the forecast errors 
are shown in the chart on page 40 of the main text. — 3 The AR(1) 
model is given by yt = c + ρyt-1 + εt, where εt is an error term with expecta-tion zero. The coefﬁ  cients c and ρ are estimated in the following on the 
basis of a rolling window of 20 quarters. — 4 This is the ﬁ  rst quarter of 
the year in the case of the spring forecast and the third quarter in the 
case of the autumn forecast. Here, the data are used which were also 
used by the Bundesbank when preparing forecasts. — 5 The forecast

39Bundesbank forecast. For the forecast horizons h=3 
to h=6, the uncertainty of the Consensus forecast is 
slightly lower than that of the Bundesbank forecast.
The assumption of unchanged interest rates in a 
large part of the sample of the Bundesbank forecasts is likely to have limited the accuracy of the Bundes-
bank forecasts, especially with regard to the inﬂ  ation 
forecast and here above all in the long term. It would therefore seem plausible that the Bundesbank fore-cast, in relation to the other forecasts, performs bet-ter for small forecast horizons than for large forecast horizons.
Also in the case of GDP, the Bundesbank forecast is 
superior to the simple models in the short term, as shown in the adjacent chart, whereas the uncertainty of the Consensus forecast is very similar. For the longer term, from around ﬁ  ve quarters, virtually no 
differences can be observed between the accuracy of 
the various forecasts.
Studies on the forecast uncertainty of other central 
banks sometimes yield results which deviate some-what from those provided here for the Bundesbank. 
For example, studies on the forecasts of the Federal 
Reserve for the USA and the Bank of England for the United Kingdom show that their inﬂ  ation forecasts 
are more accurate than those of simple models. The opposite holds true for GDP forecasts, however, 
where the simple models offer slight advantages 
across virtually all forecast horizons.

40Methodological changes and their effects are
virtually unpredictable for forecasters, so that
realisations used to calculate forecast errors
should be influenced by methodological
changes as little as possible. Conversely, it is
preferable to have as much data as possible
to calculate the realisations used. Hence it is
advisable to avoid using very early or very late
publications. The Bundesbank calculates its
forecast errors for GDP of a given quarter
based on values published in the third subse-
quent quarter, and its forecast errors for HICP
are based on values published in the third or
fourth subsequent quarter.28The realisations
calculated using this method can be seen in
the chart on this page.
Compared to simple models, the Bundes-
bank’s forecast errors in the past have beenrather small. The scale of these errors roughly
corresponds to what would be obtained if an
average were taken of a large number of
forecasts from other institutions. This means
that Bundesbank forecasts perform very well
with regard to their uncertainty (see the box
on pages 38 and 39).
The effects of the financial crisis on
forecast uncertainty and the probability
of extreme results for GDP
During the financial crisis, GDP fell sharply
throughout almost the whole world. This was
the case in Germany notably in the fourth
quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009.
Even though the Bundesbank had already
predicted downturns for these quarters in
autumn 2008, the scale of these falls was
surprising, leading to sizeable errors in fore-
casting both by the Bundesbank and other
institutions. In the fourth quarter of 2008,
real GDP fell by 2.4% compared with the
previous quarter and by as much as 3.5% in
the first quarter of 2009.29In December
2008, the Bundesbank predicted a fall of
0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2008 and 0.1%
in the first quarter of 2009. It was primarily
because of these two forecast errors that the
annual rate of change for 2009 was signifi-Time series use d for

the box on pages 42 and 43).
The chart on this page shows the mean abso-
lute errors for the year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter rates of change for GDP which re-sult from using different sample sizes. If datafor German GDP until the third quarter of2008 are used, then these errors turn out tobe considerably smaller than those that resultfrom data up to fourth quarter of 2009. Thedifferences are mainly caused by the forecasterrors for the fourth quarter of 2008 and thefirst quarter of 2009.
The mean absolute errors in the larger sample
are between 17% and 45% higher thanthose in the smaller sample. The averageincrease across all horizons for the year-on-year rate of change is around 40% andaround 30% for the quarter-on-quarter rate.It is usually assumed that expanding thesample would lead to more reliable estimates.In this instance, it would seem that the small-er sample in fact underestimated the actualGDP forecast uncertainty. This could be aresult of the very steady development ingrowth and prices during the observed timeperiod. However, it is also possible that theactual forecast uncertainty in the largersample is overestimated.
30
If this is the case, the actual forecast uncer-tainty – the expected absolute forecast error –should be somewhere between the valueswhich can be seen in the chart on this page.An extreme assumption would be to treat theexperience of the crisis as outliers that shouldnot influence estimates of uncertainty in thefuture. This however does not seem to be
justified a priori .
It is noticeable that the mean absolute errors
of the quarter-on-quarter GDP rates from thelarger sample show a slight zigzag course,giving the impression that forecast uncer-tainty at times seems to decrease as theforecast horizon increases. The error for theone-step forecast is larger than that for thetwo-step forecast, for example. This course isdue to the forecast error for the first quarterof 2009.

42Deutsche BundesbankThe impact of quarterly rates on the annual rate of change in gross domestic product in 2009
The technical relationship between quarterly
rates and the annual rate of change of a variable
provides interesting insights into the causes of
the major forecast errors in 2009 in the annual
rate of change in gross domestic product (GDP)
which many institutions made at the end of
2008. It shows that the exact points in time at
which these surprising developments occurred
were particularly significant for the forecast
error.
In December 2008, the Bundesbank forecast a
year-on-year decline in GDP of 0.8% in 2009. At
around this time, other institutions predicted a
similar decline or, in some cases, a mere stagna-
tion for this period. The Bundesbank’s forecast
was based on an estimated statistical carry-over1
of -0.8% for 2009 and the assumption that GDP
would stagnate in the course of 2009. In fact,
the statistical carry-over was -2.2% and GDP con-
tinued to fall significantly in the first quarter, re-
sulting in an annual rate of change of -4.9% for
2009.
The extent of the forecast error in the annual
rate of change for 2009 relates closely to the
forecast errors for the fourth quarter of 2008
and the first quarter of 2009. Where Giis the an-
nual rate of change of year icompared with theprevious year and gi;jthe quarter-on-quarter
rate of quarter jfrom year i,Gican be approxi-
mated using the following equation.2
Gi/C25Uiþ1=4ð4/C1gi;1þ3/C1gi;2þ2/C1gi;3þgi;4Þ
The statistical carry-over for year i, designated
Ui, which is included in this approximation, is
calculated as follows.
Ui/C251=4ðgi/C01;2þ2/C1gi/C01;3þ3/C1gi/C01;4Þ.
Thus, the quarter-on-quarter rates are factored
into the calculation of the annual rates of
change and of the statistical carry-over with dif-
ferent weights. The quarter-on-quarter rate of
the first quarter of a year is the most important
when calculating the annual rate of change. The
most important quarter-on-quarter rate when
calculating the statistical carry-over is the rate
for the fourth quarter of the previous year.
In December 2008, the Bundesbank’s forecast
error for the current quarter of 1.8 percentage
points led to an overestimation of the statistical
carry-over of approximately3/C254· 1.8 percentage
points = 1.35 percentage points and thus to the
annual rate of change for 2009 being overesti-
mated by the same amount. The Bundesbank’s
1Statistical carry-over is defined as the value of GDP in the fourth
quarter of the previous year in relation to the quarterly average of
the previous year. It thus gives the value of the annual rate of change
which would ensue if GDP in the year in question remained at thelevel reached in the fourth quarter of the previous year. The statistical
carry-over can be positive or negative. — 2A similar approximation
can be found in A J Patton and A Timmermann (2010), Predictability
of output growth and inflation: A multi-horizon survey approach, un-

433.4 percentage point forecast error at that time
for the quarter-on-quarter rate of the first quar-ter of 2009 caused the annual rate of change for2009 to be overestimated by roughly the sameamount. Taken together, both forecast errors forthe quarter-on-quarter rates gave rise to anoverestimation of the annual rate of change for2009 of some 4.75 percentage points. Since thequarter-on-quarter rates for the other quartersof 2009 were slightly underestimated on aver-age, the final forecast error for the annual rateof change for 2009 was 4.1 percentage points.
The extent of the error in the 2008 autumn fore-
cast of the annual rate of change for 2009 wastherefore caused not only by the fact that theforecast period included two quarters of excep-tionally strong GDP decline, but also by the es-pecially high weights of these quarters in thecalculation of the annual rate of change. If, forexample, the quarter-on-quarter rate hadamounted to -3.5% in the third quarter of 2009instead of in the first quarter of 2009, the impactof this exceptional value on the annual rate ofchange for 2009 would have been halved.
3The
decline in GDP would have been smaller in an-nual terms and thus the forecast error for theannual rate of change would have been less pro-nounced.However, the decomposition of the annual rate
of change into weighted quarter-on-quarterrates also shows that, in the fourth quarter of ayear, it is essentially possible to make fairly reli-able forecasts of the annual rate of change forthe following year. This presupposes that theforecast errors for the quarter-on-quarter ratesof the current and next quarter are small. If thefourth quarter of the current year and the firstquarter of the following year are predicted ac-curately, and if the data for the second and thirdquarters of the current year are known, a largepart of the information needed to accuratelypredict the annual rate of change for the follow-ing year is already available. If these four quar-ter-on-quarter rates are known, the forecasterthen has 62.5% of all of the information re-quired to predict the annual rate of change.

44forecast uncertainty, smoothed mean abso-
lute errors are used for the uncertainty mar-
gins which the Bundesbank gives for its fore-
casts.31
The chart on page 41 suggests that estimated
forecast uncertainty – measured by mean ab-
solute errors – has changed significantly be-
cause of the sharp GDP downturn around the
turn of the year 2008-2009, but that the
scale of this change is not extreme. However,
even moderate changes in the dispersion
measures can have a strong impact on the
probability of extreme events.
If, based on knowledge of the GDP data up
to the third quarter of 2008, anyone had
been asked to gauge the likelihood of a GDP
downturn of 2.4% in the fourth quarter of
2008 and of 3.5% in the first quarter of 2009
as well as of the Bundesbank’s one and two-
step forecast errors of 1.8% and 3.4% for
the current and next quarter, they would
have inevitably concluded in the light of past
forecast errors that these events were ex-
tremely unlikely. Furthermore, an analysis of
the forecast errors and quarter-on-quarter
rates would have indicated that these vari-
ables were following a normal distribution.
The probabilities that would have resulted on
the basis of the above of the occurrence of
the forecast errors and the quarter-on-quar-
ter rates that did then actually follow are in
fact extremely small.32
The larger sample of error forecasts and
quarter-on-quarter rates that is now available
produces considerably greater probabilities of
such events. Assuming a normal distributionfor all analysed variables, a future GDP
change of 2.4% would now have a probabil-
ity of 0.35%. A future GDP change of 3.5%,
however, continues to have a very small prob-
ability of less than 0.01%.
Although, assuming a normal distribution of
forecast errors, the probabilities of this mas-
sive scale of declines in macroeconomic activ-
ity now seem significantly greater than before
the crisis, in absolute terms they are still very
small. A 0.01% probability of a quarterly
event occurring implies that this event its ob-
served on average only once every 2,500
years. But if, as explained above, the forecast
uncertainty is now presumably being overesti-
mated, it must be asked whether the assump-
tion of a normal distribution for forecast
errors and quarter-on-quarter rates can still
be justified, as this distribution allocates ex-
tremely small probabilities to extreme events.
In actual fact, statistical tests would now
reject the hypothesis of normal distribution.33
Assuming a different distribution can have
31The MAEs of the individual forecast horizons are fitted
by a function in the forecast horizon function. If MAE(h)
denotes the smoothed MAE of the h-step forecast, then
this is determined by using the function
MAEðhÞ¼c1þc2/C12expðc3/C1hÞ

whose coefficients are estimated using the unsmoothed
MAEs. MAE(0) therefore equals c 1, and MAE(h) ap-
proaches the value c 1+c2for large values of h. The speed
of this approximation is determined by c 3.
32The probability of a GDP change of 2.4% would be
estimated at around one hundred thousandth of one per
cent. A forecast error of 1.8% in the zero-step forecast
would have a probability of around one millionth of one
per cent. The probabilities of a GDP change in the order
of 3.5% and a one-step forecast error of 3.4% would be
more than one thousand times less likely again.
33The tests performed take the possibility of a serial
correlation in the analysed variables into consideration.

45major consequences for the probabilities of
extreme events. A t-distribution with five de-
grees of freedom for the quarter-on-quarter
rates, for example, would imply that (based
on the larger sample) a GDP change of 3.5%
has a likelihood of 0.83% and therefore
would occur on average about once every
30 years.34
Which distribution is suitable for forecasting
errors in GDP changes cannot be determined
unequivocally owing to the small size of the
sample. In light of the forecast errors ob-
served in connection with the financial crisis,
however, it should be a distribution that allo-
cates larger probabilities to extreme events
than is the case with normal distribution.35
The Bundesbank’s fan charts only cover
ranges whose width is not more than twice
the mean absolute error and so do not
include extreme events. Therefore, for the
ranges shown in the Bundesbank fan charts,
a change in the assumed distribution would
not necessarily produce a clear change in
the corresponding probabilities for these
ranges.36
The large differences between the probabil-
ities of extreme events before and after the
crisis and for various distribution assumptions
illustrate the difficulty of making reliable
statements about such probabilities. Despite
these differences, the size of the probabilities
calculated here shows that the GDP down-
turns and forecast errors observed during the
crisis would have been regarded as virtually
impossible before the crisis.Conclusion
Macroeconomic forecasts are fraught with
uncertainty for a great many reasons, but
information about this uncertainty is required
for many economic decisions. The scale of
the uncertainty itself is uncertain, however,
and can therefore only be estimated. There
are various methods available for this pur-
pose, but it is not always easy to precisely
estimate the forecast uncertainty.
The estimated uncertainty of the Bundes-
bank’s forecasts for growth and prices is, on
the whole, smaller than that of simple but
commonly used forecast models and is only
slightly different from that of a combined
forecast which is calculated using the fore-
casts from many other institutions. Combined
forecasts are generally considered to be very
accurate, so that the uncertainty of the Bun-
desbank’s forecasts may be gauged compar-
ably small.
The recent financial crisis led to a steep
downturn in economic development, the
scale of which was previously estimated to be
highly unlikely. The lesson to be learned from
34Based on the RMSE of the smaller sample, the corres-
ponding probability would be estimated at just 0.06%.
An upper limit for probabilities can also be set using Che-
byshev’s inequality. This upper limit for the observed
quarter-on-quarter rate and the RMSE of the large sam-
ple’s forecast error is 5.6%. Such a value suggests that a
GDP change of 3.5% would occur once every four and a
half years on average. In view of the data available, this
probability seems to be too high, however.
35A t-distribution is just one of many distributions that
satisfy this criterion.
36For the range with the width of twice the absolute
error, for example, a normal distribution and a t-
distribution with five degrees of freedom both result in
probabilities of around 60%. For the normal distribution,
the probability is somewhat below this value and some-
what above it for the t-distribution.

47Extended investment
cycle with stable
prices: supply and
demand in the German
housing market
from a longer-term
perspectiveThe German housing market occupies
a special position compared with other
countries. While housing construction
and house prices in a number of indus-
trial countries have gone through
sharp ups and downs in recent years,
investment in the German housing
market has remained weak through-
out and prices have shown hardly any
change. In the first few years after Ger-
man reunification, migration move-
ments led to a housing supply short-
age, particularly in western Germany.
This triggered a sharp rise in property
prices which, with the support of gen-
erous government assistance, was fol-
lowed by a boom in residential invest-
ment. Thereafter, the cyclical counter-
movement combined with structurally
weak demand for housing and the
withdrawal of fiscal policy incentives
led to a sustained period of correction.
The recovery in housing construction
since 2005 has been extremely sub-
dued in terms of its underlying pace,
but has so far shown itself to be robust
in the economic crisis. In the short
term, the outlook for a further cyclical
improvement in residential investment
is quite favourable. In the longer term,
however, demographic factors will be
significant, although their dampening
impact should not be overestimated.

48Housing market affected by structural
changes and withdrawal of fiscal policy
incentives
For some time now, the German housing
market has been developing at quite a sub-
dued pace. This applies not only to house
prices, which, in stark contrast to the United
States and some countries in western and
southern Europe, have been subject to only
marginal fluctuations in the past decade.
Housing construction has not shown any
rapid growth in recent years either and has
persisted largely at a low level. Compared
with other countries, Germany thus occupies
a special position. This is mainly the result of
special factors during the past two decades.
The fall of the Iron Curtain and German re-
unification presented the German economy
and housing market with major challenges in
the first half of the 1990s. Furthermore,
owing to persistent differentials in real inter-
est rates, European monetary integration had
asymmetric effects in the economies of the
countries participating in monetary union,
which also had an impact on the demand for
housing. An additional factor which should
not be underestimated is that, under status
quo conditions, the consequences of demo-
graphic change and population ageing are
likely to be felt earlier and more profoundly in
Germany than in other industrial countries.
Owing to the long-term nature of residential
property investment, expectation effects
mean that these phenomena are probably al-
ready making themselves felt in the German
housing market.Such structural changes have a direct and in-
direct influence on housing markets and,
owing to the economic importance of the
property segment and numerous interactions,
also have an impact on other markets. Experi-
ence shows that effects which spread within
or via housing markets are very persistent and
shape the development of economies for a
comparatively long period of time. One factor
in this context is that, owing to the fixed loca-
tion of traded properties, regional adjustment
mechanisms are less pronounced than in mar-
kets for moveable goods and services. Fur-
thermore, it is also relevant that housing mar-
kets have a range of country-specific charac-
teristics. This concerns not only the habits of
buyers and sellers and the financing practice
of banks, but also institutional factors such as
the relative significance of the rental segment
or the legal framework for property owner-
ship and transactions, including their tax
treatment.
In the early 1990s, internal migration from
eastern to western Germany, a wave of immi-
gration (especially from eastern Europe), and
a sharp influx of asylum seekers resulted in a
housing shortage in western Germany.1
Furthermore, the baby-boomer generation
reached the age to start a family. This imbal-
ance in the housing market was clearly evi-
dent in the perceptible increase in property
prices up to the mid-1990s. Within the space
of five years, the prices of new properties in
western Germany went up by more than
one-tenth on average, while the price of
second-hand properties increased by just

49under one-quarter. Furthermore, in eastern
Germany, the housing stock, which was in a
desolate state, had to be renovated. With the
support of massive government assistance in
the form of tax benefits and subsidies for
both homebuyers and investors, there was
soon a noticeable increase in the housing
supply. At the peak of the construction boom
in 1995, almost 90% more dwellings were
completed than in 1991. At first, the con-
struction of apartments, in particular, flour-
ished, but with the depreciation conditions
for tenant-occupied housing being tightened
with effect from 1 January 1996, demand in
this segment tended to decline. Given con-
tinued increasing demand for single-family
houses and two-family houses, activity in the
housing construction sector remained favour-
able well into the year 2000, however.
Over the past decade, growth in residential
construction has been decidedly weak. Be-
tween 2000 and 2009, the number of dwell-
ings completed fell by 63%. Along this
downward trend, there were strong short-
term fluctuations in the construction of new
single-family houses and two-family houses.
The ongoing political debate on the grant to
homebuyers led to very volatile developments
in construction permits and substantial antici-
patory effects in the years before the grant
was completely abolished for new cases from
2006 onwards. Furthermore, the increase in
the standard rate of VAT from 16% to 19%
with effect from 1 January 2007 prompted
many homebuilders to bring forward, in par-
ticular, costly projects to 2006. Compared
with weak activity in new buildings, construc-
tion measures on the existing housing stockgained in importance. This is probably due in
part to the fact that the Federal Government
has, for some time, been paying interest-rate
subsidies, in particular, to the KfW Banking
Group for loans at favourable interest rates
for energy-saving measures. This is attested
by the fact that turnover in the interior and
finishing construction sector increased again
in real terms after 2005, while business in the
main construction sector continued to be on
a downward trend.
Demand for housing over the past two
decades
With the exception of the first half of the
1990s, demand for housing in Germany has
been influenced by rather weak fundamen-
tals. Demographic change, in particular, has
left visible marks. After rising by two million
to around 82 million between 1991 and
1997, Germany’s population has subsequent-
ly changed only slightly. According to esti-
mates by the Federal Statistical Office, a fur-
ther subdued population growth of just over
half a million up to 2003 was followed by a
similar-sized decline in the population by
2009.
Given this development, the demand for add-
itional dwellings since the mid-1990s has
arisen from the tendency towards smaller-
sized households. In particular, the number of
single-person households has grown signifi-
cantly over the past two decades. While the
percentage of two-person households has
also risen slightly, the relative importance of
traditional family households has continued... followed by

50to decline. In the early 1990s, there was a
more or less equal distribution among these
three types of household, but in 2008 only
just over one-quarter of households had three
or more members, while almost two-fifths of
households comprised only one person.
The number of members of a household, its
composition, as well as the age structure of
the persons in it, influence the size of thedwelling. The space per dwelling is generally
likely to decrease at a below-average rate in
relation to the number of household mem-
bers because each dwelling possesses com-
munally used rooms. Furthermore, the ageing
of the population means that persons of an
advanced age, who often stay in their present
houses or apartments once their children
have moved out, as they are used to living
there, account for an ever greater share of
the overall population. According to surveys
conducted by the Socio-Economic Panel, in
western Germany the average living space
per household member rose by one-fifth to
55 m2between 1990 and 2008. In eastern
Germany, the increase was twice as large,
although, at 46 m2on average according to
the latest figures, per capita living space was
still well below the west German level.2
Economic performance influences the de-
mand for housing in two ways. First, ad-
vances in productivity make it easier to safe-
guard a high level of employment and form a
basis for sustained growth in real per capita
income. For households, this not only means
a permanent increase in the financial scope
for housing expenditures, it also helps to sta-
bilise future flows of income and thus con-
tributes to planning certainty, which plays an
important role in the acquisition of owner-
occupied housing. Furthermore, economic
prosperity facilitates the general social task of
providing adequate housing for those per-
sons whose income and asset situation doesInhabitants and households

51not allow them to do this for themselves.
Second, a location with productive enter-prises that are well placed to compete inter-nationally generally attracts workers fromother countries and regions, which, per se ,
also results in an increased demand for hous-ing.
In Germany, the economic burdens of reunifi-
cation and the failure to adapt at an earlystage to the challenges brought about by theprogressive globalisation of economic activityand the opening of the markets in centraland eastern Europe resulted in a need forstructural adjustment building up over thecourse of the 1990s. As a consequence, witha low propensity to invest and a growing bur-den of social security contributions, growthwas comparatively weak, unemployment be-came more and more entrenched and bothgeneral government and the statutory socialsecurity systems were financially over-stretched. As a response to this, there wereyears of wage moderation, moves to createflexibility in wage agreements, structural re-forms in the labour market and statutory so-cial security funds as well as consolidation ef-forts in the public sector. For households,these measures meant that their earnings andtransfers increased only moderately. Incomeeffects impacted on the demand for housing.Moreover, during this period it became no-ticeable that, compared with other countries,Germany had become less attractive as a mi-gration destination for persons seeking tem-porary or permanent work opportunities inanother country.The demand for housing is expressed in the
search for an appropriate dwelling, which iseither to be purchased or rented. In Germanythe rental segment is relatively large com-pared with other countries. Only just overtwo-fifths of households live in owner-occupied housing. Within the euro area, Ger-many has thus by far the smallest ratio ofowner-occupier housing.
3The rental market
for apartments in multiple-family dwellings isparticularly broad. The acquisition of suchproperties is therefore not to be seen solely inthe context of owner occupation, but canalso be a pure capital investment decision, inwhich returns are considered in comparisonwith alternative forms of investment. How-ever, since the mid-1990s, there has been asignificant decline in investment in newapartments for the purpose of renting in rela-tion to the construction of new owner-occupied houses. Measured in terms of theestimated costs of the completed dwellings,the level fell by 50% during this period andamounted to only just over 10% in 2009.
In the context of property acquisition, the de-
mand for housing is closely linked to credit fi-nancing issues. The acquisition of a propertyfor self-occupancy is taken into considerationespecially in the period when establishing ahousehold and starting a family, as there istypically a suddenly increased need for alarger dwelling, particularly as this is generallyalso the stage of life when there is an im-provement in the income situation and thusalso in creditworthiness.

52below 25 years of age live in an owner-
occupied single-family house, the figure rises
to just over 30% if the head of the household
has reached 45 years of age and then hardly
changes as age increases. In addition, the
percentage of households living in an owner-
occupied apartment also rises significantly in
this age group. The demand for housing can
therefore be negatively affected by debt fi-
nancing conditions, as, particularly in thecase of young households, lending can be
limited owing to household income being too
low or the capital base being insufficient,
thus preventing, or at least delaying, the real-
isation of the living arrangement that is actu-
ally preferred.
Owning a home generally becomes afford-
able when a household is able to ensure that
it can make the interest and redemption pay-
ments on the mortgage loan over the long
term after having taken account of its (ex-
pected) income flow, its living and consump-
tion habits, other financial obligations and an
interest rate risk. An affordability index – de-
fined as the ratio between the maximum sus-
tainable regular loan repayment amount,
which is a function of household income and
the credit conditions (ie interest rate and ma-
turity), and the property price – can thus indi-
cate whether the demand for housing is fos-
tered or hampered by financing conditions.
Since German reunification, the affordability
restriction for households whose main wage
earner is between 25 and 40 years of age has
tended to become less critical, despite the
comparatively subdued income growth. This
is due to a trend decline in interest costs on
mortgage loans and the fact that house
prices have increased very moderately.
When granting a home loan, banks addition-
ally require sufficient own funds, which, in
addition to financial assets, can also comprise
personal contributions to home improve-
ments. However, banks do at least vary the
interest rate depending on the loan-to-value
ratio, which, in turn, can have an effect on af-
fordability. Close to the time of the acquisi-Completed new housing

funds as a percentage of the purchase price
can be approximated by the relationship be-
tween remaining debt and the market value
of the property. According to data from the
Income and Expenditure Survey, for house-
holds whose main wage earner is between
25 and 35 years of age, this ratio was around
60% in 2008, which was still at the lower
end of the range of usual loan-to-value ratios.

than 35% in 1998.4
Supply situation and equilibrium
reactions in the housing market
In geographical terms, housing markets are
strongly segmented. The ratio of supply and
demand can therefore vary quite considerably
from one regional market to another. Owing
to comparatively weak arbitrage mechan-
isms, there may be differences over an ex-
tended period of time with regard to the mar-
ket situations in the rental and purchase seg-
ments, too, as well as in types of housing.
Notwithstanding certain discrepancies, it
may, however, be assumed that, in the early
1990s, the German housing market was
characterised by a considerable supply short-
age. In western Germany this essentially re-Owner-occupied housing and

54sulted from the high level of immigration,
while, in eastern Germany, part of the exist-
ing housing supply was not marketable after
the change in system of government. By con-
trast, the overall picture at the current end is
characterised by a greater heterogeneity. In
some urban and economically prosperous
areas, the housing supply is at present likely
to match demand by and large, while in more
rural regions, especially in eastern Germany,
there is sometimes an obvious supply over-
hang. According to the “Techem-empirica-
Leerstandsindex” (Techem empirca vacancy
index), between 5% and 10% of apartments
on the market in the east German federal
states (excluding Berlin) stood vacant in
2008, for example, while the corresponding
ratios for Hamburg, Bavaria and Baden-
W/C252rttemberg were merely below 2%.
Tensions in the housing markets are often
triggered by marked changes on the demand
side. As a rule, there are initially price move-
ments because supply adjusts only gradually
to demand. In the case of housing invest-
ment, not only the planning phase and con-
struction work but also administrative pro-
cesses, such as the permit procedure, take
quite a long time. When supply adjusts to de-
mand, the price progressively returns to the
level justified by the fundamentals. This
response pattern is reflected empirically in a
positive correlation of housing investment
and house prices.5It can generally be as-
sumed that the price will fluctuate all the
more strongly, the greater the imbalance is
initially and the more lethargically the supply
side responds.Compared with other countries, house prices
in Germany are characterised by low volatility.
Only in the wake of the massive demand
shock after reunification did prices rise sharp-
ly. This could be interpreted to mean that the
supply of housing in Germany is rather elas-
tic. However, fluctuations are also reduced by
the existence of institutional arrangements to
prevent expectation-driven, self-reinforcing
price-formation processes. Key to this is that
homebuyers and investors have a sufficient
long-term orientation and that banks pursue
risk-appropriate lending practices. The pru-
dent calculation of loan-to-value ratios when
granting mortgage loans plays a particular
part in this. However, the comparatively
stable property prices in western Germany
over the past decade could also be an indica-
tion that the housing stock is largely in equi-
librium. The fact that the creeping decline in
demand for housing in eastern Germany,
caused by low birth rates and emigration, has
not depressed property prices more strongly
in recent years is also likely to be due to
demolition programmes, which have reduced
the housing supply in the low-quality seg-
ment.6

“Stadtumbau Ost” (urban renewal in eastern Germany)

Brandenburg, Saxony and Thuringia, approximately 3%

molished or dismantled. See the annual statistics of the

55can make a significant explanatory contribu-
tion in statistical analyses, too. For example,econometric results indicate that investmentin housing construction forms a stable equi-librium relationship in the long term with theresident population and per capita income
(adjusted for price and terms of trade effects)as demand-side trend factors, and the realhouse price.
7Just like investment activities,
price fluctuations are to be classified theoret-ically as endogenous equilibrium reactionswhich are relevant from a longer-term per-spective insofar as they reflect persistent ten-sions between housing supply and demand.A trend component for residential investmentcan be derived from such a model. Duringthe period from 1991 to 2009, this trendcomponent followed a very smooth pathwith a slight downward tendency. According-ly, the time series after German reunificationwas characterised by a very long cycle span-ning a decade and a half. As a result of theconstruction boom at the start of the 1990s,it was possible in a matter of a few years tooffset substantial supply shortages that hadarisen after reunification. However, this pro-cess created capacities in the housing con-struction sector which, measured in terms ofthe long-term fundamentals, were obviouslytoo large. Subsequently, there was a sharpcorrection during the first half of the pastdecade, which was followed by a moderaterecovery from 2005 onwards.
The underlying cyclical pattern of investment
activity is consistent with the aggregate mar-ket valuations regarding the relative advan-tages of new and second-hand properties. Ifthe properties are of identical quality (thisalso includes the age of the existing proper-
ties), their sale prices should be in a state ofequilibrium. If houses up for resale are tem-porarily more expensive than comparableproperties for first occupancy, householdsand investors increasingly opt for the newTrend-cycle decomposition of

56property. This entails a larger-scale housing
investment than the opposite situation in
which, in response to overpriced new proper-
ties, there is greater demand for existing
properties, where investment costs are usual-
ly limited to modernisation and, possibly, also
extension work.
If the resale price is interpreted as the current
market value and the corresponding price of
the new property as the replacement costs,
the price ratio as defined in Tobin’s q theory
may be regarded as a cyclical determinant of
housing construction.8Tobin’s q is generally
considered to be an overall statistic of the
propensity to invest, which combines demand
conditions and production-side cost struc-
tures, including installation costs, and, ideally,
tax aspects in a single variable.9Using marketvaluations for measurements is consistent
with the core concept of the q theory. The im-
plementation chosen here, using price data
provided by BulwienGesa AG relating funda-
mentally to the same standardised properties
in both new construction and resale, ensures
a high degree of homogeneity with regard to
price-relevant characteristics. By contrast, age
is a relevant quality feature in which new and
second-hand properties naturally differ.
As long as the average age and other price-
relevant quality characteristics of the available
second-hand properties – provided no adjust-
ment is made for them – remain unchanged
over time,10an analysis of Tobin’s q in relation
to its longer-term average is sufficient for the
cyclical interpretation. On the basis of the
below-average values directly after German
reunification, the q statistic indicates favour-
able conditions overall for the formation of
new housing capital in the period from the
mid-1990s to the economic downturn at the
start of the past decade. Since then, Tobin’s q
has again been in contractionary territory.Ageing of the stock of

9In line with the usual empirical implementation, in this
application too, Tobin’s (marginal) q, which, according to
the theory, relates to the marginal investment, is approxi-
mated by the corresponding average value. In the inter-
pretation, it should also be noted that the current q stat-
istic alone provides an adequate overall measurement of
investment propensity only if the short-term supply curve
coincides with the long-term supply curve. However, ad-
justment lags can be expected in housing construction,
meaning that the supply is rather inelastic in the short-
term and the assessment of the investment conditions re-
quires a forecast of the q statistic. See, for example,

United States, Journal of Political Economy 96, 4, pp 718-

57The market valuations therefore confirm the
outcome of the trend-cycle decomposition,
according to which housing construction has
remained weak in cyclical terms since 2003.
In terms of its basic conclusions, the finding
of the q theory is not relativised by the fact
that the housing stock has aged noticeably
over the past decade. This development is not
only due to the low propensity for investing
in new properties for a number of years. An
additional special factor is that around four-
fifths of the demolition programmes that
were launched in eastern Germany after the
turn of the millennium relate to dwellings
built as recently as the 1970s and 1980s that
are no longer marketable located in predom-
inantly large housing estates on the outskirts
of cities or towns. This means that, compared
with the normal service life of residential
buildings, relatively new properties are being
removed from the housing stock. According
to data from the Federal Statistical Office, the
average age of housing assets rose by two
years to 271/C252years between 2000 and 2009,
compared with an increase of only just under
half a year between 1991 and 2000.
Short and longer-term outlook
for the housing market
According to econometric estimates, housing
investment – disregarding weather-related ef-
fects – is currently still somewhat below its
trend path. From a cyclical perspective, there
is therefore still scope for a certain amount of
recovery. Looking at a series of individual indi-
cators also points to stimuli for housing con-struction. To date, interest rates for mortgage
loans have more or less returned to their all-
time low of mid-2005. Consequently, owner-
occupied houses have per se become more
affordable. However, this has to be countered
by a possible reduction in potential output
growth and, thus, longer-term income pro-
spects as a result of the economic crisis.11Fur-
thermore, according to the results of the
Bank Lending Survey, since the start of the
turbulence in the international financial mar-
kets, banks have been steadily tightening
their (hitherto more relaxed) housing loan al-
location practice, even though there has
been a tendency to do this less recently.
Nevertheless, a key criterion when granting
housing loans is the job security of the home-
buyer. Owing to the remarkably robust state
of the labour market, the risk of being laid off
is still considered to be relatively low. Finally,
households’ net asset position improved
again considerably in 2009. Besides their own
savings efforts, this is also accounted for by
the fact that the losses suffered by financial
assets in 2008 were recouped during 2009.12
The cyclical recovery in new housing con-
struction could also be bolstered by the fact
that there has been no further rise in the cost
of construction work recently following sharp
increases in the period from 2006 to 2008
due to higher prices for raw materials and the

58sharp increase in the standard rate of VAT.
There is likely to be a tendency for renovation
measures on the existing housing stocks to in-
crease. This is corroborated by the wide-
spread willingness, given the expectation of
permanently higher energy prices, to extend
the thermal insulation of properties and to
modernise the heating and hot-water supply,
especially as this is being promoted by low-
interest loans and investment grants from the
KfW Banking Group.
In the medium to long term, housing con-
struction will chiefly be influenced by the
trend factors of the demand for housing.
Demographic change will play a major role as
a dampening factor in this context, but
should not be overemphasised. Given increas-
ing labour mobility, which, particularly in Eur-
ope, is being limited less and less by institu-
tional, linguistic and cultural obstacles, (rela-
tive) economic performance is a key deter-
minant for the resident population of a region
or country. The resulting migration move-
ments influence the demand for housing, justlike the productivity gains that can be
achieved at a competitive and innovative lo-
cation and which can permanently increase
the level of prosperity. Stimuli for housing
construction are generated when, in line with
individual preferences, the living space per
person increases further or greater value is
placed on the constructional features and fa-
cilities of the buildings.
Homeowners and investors are interested in
properties maintaining their value in the long
term. High market volatility reduces the abil-
ity to forecast important factors underlying
property investment decisions. Excessive price
fluctuations are particularly disruptive to this
process. Following the end of the price surge
resulting from shortages in the housing mar-
ket during the first half of the 1990s, it has
been possible during the last 15 years to
maintain a stable price environment in the
German housing market. In order to ensure
that this is the case in the future too, there is,
above all, a need for prudent market players
who can adequately assess risks.Housing

59The whole and its
parts: problems with
the aggregation of
seasonally adjusted
dataIn recent times, in particular, major de-
viations between directly seasonally
adjusted euro-area aggregates and the
values calculated using the national re-
sults of euro-area member states have
come to the surface. Such discrepancies
are the result, not least, of the uneven
application of the seasonal adjustment
procedure, in particular when model-
ling the abrupt and strong effects of
the last economic and financial crisis.
However, there are also other statis-
tical methodological issues which lead
to differences of this nature.
Against this background, this article
begins by describing and explaining
the aim of seasonal adjustment before
looking more closely at the causes
of the aforementioned deviations.
Although no prevailing theoretical
procedure exists for solving this basic
problem, in the field of official statis-
tics, however, empirically-based strat-
egies which meet the demand for con-
sistency in seasonally adjusted data
have emerged in practice. At the Euro-
pean level, the consistent calculation
of seasonally adjusted euro-area ag-
gregates and their national compon-
ents can be improved further through
the rigorous use of existing guidelines.
This would also make it easier to accur-
ately interpret the results.

60Task of seasonal adjustment
Seasonally adjusted data are a long-estab-
lished and proven instrument for economic
analysis. Seasonal adjustment can be used to
filter out or highlight the underlying develop-
ment from unadjusted series of economic
statistics. This is done by estimating seasonal
factors, ie effects which occur year on year in
the same month or quarter with identical or
similar intensity, and removing them from the
unadjusted data. Calendar effects are also
adjusted for wherever their existence can be
demonstrated and sufficiently quantified.
From a time series perspective, the news
which are of particular interest remain, these
being the trend, the cycle – which is central
to economic analysis – and irregular move-
ments.
The calculation of seasonally adjusted results
begins with the unadjusted data. These data
are used to estimate the seasonal compon-
ent. In order to do this, the time period
underlying the estimation must be defined.
Each new or revised raw value changes the
reporting population and provides new infor-
mation for seasonal adjustment. Consequent-
ly, owing to the inclusion of new data, the ad-
justed results may change, even for earlier
time periods. In addition, the selection and
concrete specification of the variables used in
calendar adjustment play a significant role.
The choice of seasonal adjustment procedure,
the seasonal and trend component filters and
other options selected in the programs also
have an effect on the result. In addition, it
must be ensured that strong atypical effects,
such as the abrupt collapse in real GDP in2008 Q4 and 2009 Q1 as a result of the eco-
nomic and financial crisis, do not bias the sea-
sonal estimation. The calculation of seasonal-
ly adjusted data requires a chain of decisions
which must be reviewed in terms of their ad-
equacy and appropriateness. This means that,
for instance, when using the X-12-ARIMA
seasonal adjustment procedure developed by
the US Census Bureau and used for official
statistics in Germany, it is possible, through
the use of various test statistics, to avoid a re-
sidual seasonality in the seasonally adjusted
results or excessively high variability in the
seasonal component.1
Seasonally adjusted figures are not only de-
pendent on such methodological decisions.
Another key factor is whether the seasonally
adjusted results have been calculated directly,
or indirectly by aggregating the adjusted re-
sults for all components of the aggregate. In
this way it is possible, for example, to esti-
mate the seasonally adjusted data for Ger-
man industrial output directly or as the
(weighted) sum of the adjusted results for the
main groups (intermediate, capital, durable
and non-durable goods). This aspect is not
unimportant in quantitative terms as the re-
sults of the two methods differ by up to1/C252%.
The question of direct or indirect adjustment
is significant not only from a sectoral perspec-
tive at the national level. The problem also
has an international dimension. For example,
it must be decided whether the seasonally
adjusted data for the euro area are to be esti-
mated directly or derived from the national

61data. Both methods lead to different results
in this case as well. Looking at the data from
January 2008 onwards, there are visible devi-
ations of up to 2.4% between the results for
euro-area industrial output calculated using
the direct and indirect approaches. The long-
term development is similar according to
both methods, but in the case of quarter-on-
quarter changes there are often discrepancies
of more than 1.5 percentage points. The
monthly percentage changes often even have
different signs.
Thus, the question arises as to whether coun-
try group aggregates should be directly ad-
justed (for example by international organisa-
tions) or whether the seasonally adjusted
data for the individual countries should be
combined to form aggregates for country
groups. There is no universally applicable an-
swer to this question. Both procedures have
their merits but also their problems. For this
reason, no uniform method is used for official
statistics. Instead, the idea is to take due ac-
count of the individual analytical characteris-
tics of the time series and specific statistical
conditions.
Reasons for the direct approach
The core concept underlying seasonal adjust-
ment is based on the decomposition of the
values of the unadjusted series into four
unobservable components: the trend-cycle
component (summarised here), the seasonal
component, the calendar component and the
irregular component. During normal model-
ling this decomposition is conducted separ-ately for each time series with no account
being taken of references to other series. It
thus stands to reason a priori that directly and
indirectly adjusted data will not match. Only
under very close restrictions is it possible to
mathematically “force” equality. Equality can
only occur if the seasonal component is not
dependent on the level of the time series, no
strong extraordinary effects occur and condi-
tions causing the seasonal effects change at
the same rate in all time series. These condi-
tions are, in practice, never met. Generally,
seasonal fluctuations increase as the series
level increases, outliers occur in almost every
time series and the seasonal conditions some-
times change dramatically (such as for
example the number of persons registered as
unemployed as a result of the introduction of
the seasonal short-time work benefit) whileEuro-area industrial output *

62in other cases they hardly change (such as the
effect of the summer holidays on real gross
value added in the manufacturing sector).
Therefore, for both theoretical and empirical
reasons, it must be assumed that there will be
a difference between the directly and in-
directly adjusted results.2
It is possible to illustrate this basic statement
using a simple thought experiment. Thisinvolves abstraction from the real world in
order to emphasise the aspect relevant for
seasonal adjustment. It is assumed that
Christmas trading in the German retail indus-
try takes place, as before, exclusively in the
final quarter of a given year but that the
products in demand vary and that this vari-
ation is entirely dependent on what is in fash-
ion that year. Demand may be concentrated
on consumer electronics one year, with other
branches being more or less left out of Christ-
mas sales activity. Demand for telecommuni-
cation equipment could then peak the
following year. The next year might then see
a concentration of demand on household
appliances with a harsh winter the year after
meaning that “only” clothing is under the
Christmas tree. The individual areas of the
retail sector would therefore each have ex-
perienced a peak in Christmas season sales
on exactly one occasion during the observa-
tion period. This fluctuation would not be
repeated on an annual basis when looking at
each specific business line and would thus
not be allocated to the seasonal component
but would appear as a statistical outlier. AsThought experiment I

Year 2Multivariate approaches have been developed in order
to simultaneously derive seasonally adjusted data from
unadjusted data and take account of aggregation rela-
tionships between the time series. However, they are very
complex and have not yet been used in official statistics
which require many thousands of time series to be sea-
sonally adjusted. The idea of directly estimating all sea-
sonally adjusted time series in a first step and then, in a
second step, distributing the deviations between the
directly and indirectly adjusted data in such a way that,
on the one hand, the aggregation relationships are met
and, on the other, that the developments of the directly
adjusted values are disrupted as little as possible, has only
been used seldomly. This is because this two-step ap-
proach is technically demanding and makes seasonal ad-
justment less transparent. For more detailed information
on these topics see R Astolfi, D Ladiray und G L Mazzi
(2001), Seasonal Adjustment of European Aggregates:

ments, as well as the literature cited therein.Thought

63the time series for sales for the individual
areas of the retail sector would not have a
seasonal component, their unadjusted and
adjusted values would be identical. Subse-
quently, the indirectly seasonally adjusted
series for total retail sales would be calcu-
lated using the aggregate of the unadjusted
data for the components. But, because Christ-
mas sales recur annually in the aggregated
time series, a so-called residual seasonality
emerges which would, however, not be iden-
tified as such when using the indirect ap-
proach. This can only be avoided by using the
direct approach as this would make it possible
to observe and calculate the seasonality
caused by the aggregation of the individual
components. Differences between the direct-
ly adjusted aggregate and the total of its
adjusted components would be acceptable
according to this argument, even if they are
large.3
There is also an estimation-theoretic argu-
ment in favour of the direct method. This
argument is based on the observation that
irregularities in components play a much
larger role than irregularities at the level of an
aggregate. If the noise in the individual com-
ponents is not entirely positively correlated, it
is at least partially cancelled out by the aggre-
gation process. Technically speaking, the pro-
portion of the total variance of the unadjust-
ed series attributable to the variance of the
irregular component decreases as the aggre-
gation level increases. The less noise, the eas-
ier it is to estimate the seasonal component
using the unadjusted data. Thus, directly ad-
justed data are calculated more accurately
than is the case when using the indirect ap-proach, which is based on difficult estima-
tions at the component level. The differences
between the directly adjusted values and the
sum total of the adjusted components
should, according to this view, be understood
and interpreted to be accuracy gains from the
direct method.
Reasons for the indirect approach
The reasons for the direct approach presented
thus far admittedly represent only one-half of
the argument. There are also strong argu-
ments for the indirect approach. To examine
these arguments, one needs to revisit the aim
of seasonal adjustment: to remove seasonal
and calendar effects from an unadjusted ser-
ies. In a hypothetical perfectly adjusted series,
neither seasonal nor calendar effects are
present. In other words, the seasonal adjust-
ment transforms the values for the real world
(unadjusted values) into values for a hypo-
thetical world where there are no seasonal or
calendar effects. In such a world, the average
temperature in winter is identical to that in
summer, there are no Christmas or other holi-
days, the labour force works without the typ-
ical holiday periods and normal productivity is
maintained through the weekend. Only long-
term growth trends, business cycles and
irregular events occur (for example large
orders, strikes or political influences such as
VAT increases). In this world an aggregate
would also have to represent the sum of its

64components. A situation in which an optimal-
ly seasonally adjusted GDP pointed in one
direction while all optimally adjusted domes-
tic expenditure components and net exports
pointed in another direction would not be ac-
ceptable. For many people using these statis-
tics, this consistency requirement might even
represent an imperative condition for deriving
seasonally adjusted results.In a further thought experiment it is possible
to gain an understanding of the advantages
of the indirect approach. It is necessary once
again to abstract from reality by emphasising
the aspects relevant for seasonal adjustment
while disregarding other circumstances for
the sake of simplicity. The example is based
on assumptions regarding two sectors: the
construction and energy sectors. While colder
periods of the year lead to output cuts in the
construction industry, they lead to intra-year
output peaks in the energy sector. With re-
gard to the trend cycle, both sectors move in
the opposite direction: as one branch gains in
importance, the other decreases in import-
ance (and vice versa). There are no irregular
fluctuations. Under these conditions, the sea-
sonally adjusted series for each economic
sector coincides with the trend cycle. The in-
directly adjusted results for the construction
and energy sectors combined, calculated
using these data, produce a smooth series.
This must now be compared with the results
of the direct approach. These results are cal-
culated from the raw values of the combined
series which in turn are the result of adding
the initial data for the components. However,
as the individual components’ share of the
aggregate shifts over time, at the aggregated
level there is not a stable seasonal component
but rather a seasonal component which
changes over time. This could not be suffi-
ciently captured using the direct adjustment
approach and would, at least in part, be mis-
interpreted as an irregular influence. In an ex-
treme case, direct seasonal adjustment might
incorrectly fail to produce any seasonal com-
ponent which could be eliminated. The dir-
ectly seasonally adjusted results would thenThought experiment II

65be identical to the unadjusted values of the
aggregate and would then mistakenly not be
adjusted for the changes in the seasonal com-
ponent. This problem can only be solved
using an indirect approach.
The fact that the components each describe
more homogeneous variables than the data
for the aggregates, which are formed on the
basis of these homogeneous building blocks,
is another argument in favour of the indirect
approach. Thus, the conditions causing the
seasonal and calendar effects at the compon-
ent level can be expected to also be more
stable over time than in the case of the
inhomogeneous aggregates. Certainly, the
more stable the conditions are, the more
accurately the seasonal component, calendar
influences and, therefore, also the seasonally
adjusted series can be estimated. On the
basis of these considerations, the indirect
approach would be expected to be more
accurate than the direct approach.
Practical conclusions
The considerations detailed so far have made
it clear that there is as yet no dominant pro-
cedure which stands above the others. How-
ever, it is possible to draw some conclusions
from the facts stated so far in this article
which are incorporated into the official sea-
sonal adjustment procedure in Germany. Ini-
tially it must be stated that the requirement
for consistent seasonally adjusted data can,
under certain conditions, lead to a residual
seasonality in the indirectly adjusted time ser-
ies. Whether these conditions are actuallypresent and how important they are is ultim-
ately an empirical question. It is for this rea-
son that indirectly seasonally adjusted data in
Germany are tested for residual seasonality.
The Census X-12-ARIMA procedure has many
diagnostic tools for this purpose (such as an
analysis of the spectral density of the seasonal
frequencies of the seasonally adjusted series
or of the irregular component). On balance,
there is generally no noteworthy residual sea-
sonality observable in the case of the indirect-
ly adjusted German data.
Owing to the strong influence of irregular
factors in the case of highly disaggregated
data, this level is generally not used as the
basis for the indirect derivation of seasonally
adjusted macroeconomic aggregates. On the
other hand, the reasons for seasonality at the
aggregated level are generally more complex
and more difficult to interpret. On balance,
an intermediate aggregation level is most
suitable as the basis for an indirect adjust-
ment. X-12-ARIMA offers revision analyses in
order to define this level more precisely. This
is based on the following thinking: as long as
the seasonal conditions at the component
level are more stable over time than is the
case with the aggregate and if the seasonal
components for the components can be
clearly identified, then the revisions of the
indirectly seasonally adjusted data caused by
the inclusion of new unadjusted data are
smaller than the revisions in the case of direct
adjustment. For example, average absolute
corrections of the indirectly adjusted data for
construction orders received are nearly one-
half less than those in the case of the directly
calculated data. In the case of the data forSeasonal

66orders received by industry derived from the
adjusted data for the main groups by order
region, the revisions are just over one-quarter
less than is the case for the directly estimated
aggregate. This supports the use of the indir-
ect approach employed in official German
statistics. By contrast, the revisions of the dir-
ectly and indirectly calculated data for indus-
trial output are practically identical. In this
case it is possible to estimate consistent, indir-
ectly seasonally adjusted data without any
noticeable effects with respect to revisions.
These revisions, which are calculated using
the X-12-ARIMA procedure, serve only to
evaluate the degree of advantageousness of
the direct or indirect approach. They should
not be confused with the real-time revisions
of the seasonally adjusted data, which also
reflect the corrections caused by changes to
the unadjusted data.
The arguments discussed thus far refer to all
types of aggregation of seasonally adjusted
data across classification levels, be it through
the merging of economic sectors, categories
of goods, expenditure categories, income
levels, professions or regions. In view of the
international division of labour and the ques-
tion as to whether seasonally adjusted coun-
try group aggregates should be estimated dir-
ectly from the aggregated unadjusted data or
derived indirectly from the adjusted national
data, further aspects also play a role. Particu-
lar attention must be paid to the distribution
of the information relevant for the seasonal
adjustment, as the more elements of infor-
mation that can be taken into account, the
more reliable the estimated results. Not only
statistical information but also economic,political and other information is important
for seasonal adjustment. Statistical changes
to the classification of the data, the data col-
lection procedure or the compilation proced-
ures can bring about changes to the seasonal
component which need to be taken into
account. Economic effects, such as changes
to Christmas bonuses and holiday pay, also
have direct effects, for example on the sea-
sonal component of salary statistics. More-
over, it must also be ensured, through model-
ling outlier variables, that one-off special
effects (such as the sudden collapse in many
economic statistical time series in 2008 Q4
and 2009 Q1 as a result of the global eco-
nomic and financial crisis) are not mistakenly
regarded as typical for the time of year and
then included in the seasonal component to
some extent. Political effects, such as the
introduction of seasonal short-time working
benefits or the declaration of national and
regional public holidays, should also be taken
into account. Finally, weather information
also plays a role in order to ensure, for ex-
ample, that the atypical long cold period last
winter does not bias the estimation of the
seasonal fluctuation that is expected under
normal conditions.
Obviously it is not enough to simply collect
this information. It must be appropriately
integrated into the seasonal adjustment in
order to increase the data quality. This re-
quires extensive experience and knowledge
of the program used as well as appropriate
time resources. All of these aspects are to be
considered in order to ensure an appropriate
international division of labour.International

67In order to produce internationally compar-
able seasonally adjusted data, it is necessaryto agree on one or a handful of effectiveprocedures. No less important is the harmon-isation of the aim of seasonal adjustment andthe application principles. At present there isstill significant room for manoeuvre in thisregard. For example, the large deviations be-tween the directly and indirectly seasonallyadjusted data for euro-area industrial outputmentioned at the beginning of this articlepoint to existing differences in the applicationof the seasonal adjustment procedures. Forexample, if the sharp effects of the economiccrisis were modelled as a cyclical break usingX-12-ARIMA in all underlying time series aspart of a test calculation, the deviations be-tween the directly adjusted euro-area aggre-gate and the (weighted) sum of the adjustednational components would decrease from amaximum of 2.4% since 2008 to no morethan 0.5%. This once again illustrates the im-portance of an internationally harmonised
procedure.
On the basis of such experience, the Euro-
pean central banks and statistical offices havedeveloped guidelines for the harmonisationof seasonal adjustment, which were adoptedin 2008.
4The implementation of these guide-
lines has since been fleshed out further inexpert workshops, and new computer pro-grams are being developed in order to makethis even easier. There is still a lot of work tobe done in order to achieve the long-termobjective of harmonised seasonally adjusteddata for all European countries and to aggre-gate this data to form country group results.However, the path being pursued is undoubt-edly both correct and important.
