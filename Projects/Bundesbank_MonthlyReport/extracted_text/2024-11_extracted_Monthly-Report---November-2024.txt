5Overview

Overview
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 61 Global economy and international financial markets
1.1 Global economy still sluggish
The global economy remained on a moderate growth path in the third quarter of 
2024.  The United States was yet again its main pillar. Its gross domestic product  ( ) GDP
rose significantly in the third quarter, too, after price and seasonal adjustment. On the 
other hand, Chinese economic activity was once again anaemic, not least because of 
the ongoing real estate market crisis. Economic output in the euro area increased 
markedly, mainly due to one-off effects.
The recent improvement in industry is unlikely to last.  As in the second quarter, 
global industrial output rose perceptibly in the summer months, too. The economies of 
Asia, which are highly integrated into international value chains, were a significant 
factor in this. Global trade in goods expanded even more buoyantly. However, front-
loading effects appear to have been playing a role in this. In the previous quarter, 
companies had already restocked their inventories in anticipation of possible trade 
policy frictions and the threat of disruptions to shipping. It thus remains to be seen 
whether the recent upswing will prove sustainable. This is also shown by recent 
purchasing managers’ surveys, according to which output growth in the manufacturing 
sector globally came to a standstill as of late and order books have continued to shrink. 
Political demands for new tariff barriers pose considerable additional risks to interna-
tional trade.
1.2 Global inflation falling, core inflation often still high
Crude oil prices recently declined markedly.  In addition to demand concerns, specula-
tion about Saudi Arabia and other  countries stepping up production is likely to OPEC
have been the main driver behind the decline in prices. Overall, according to Interna-
tional Energy Agency estimates, the global oil market is likely to be significantly 
oversupplied next year. Given the outlook of ample supplies going forward, increasing 
tensions in the Middle East have only led to moderate and temporary price spikes.

Overview
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 7Inflation rates continue to decline, mainly under the influence of energy prices, but 
core rates are still high . In the advanced economies, the year-on-year increase in 
consumer prices went down to 2.4 % by October. Three months earlier, this figure was 
2.8 %. Energy price reductions contributed significantly to this decline. Over the rest of 
the year, however, such dampening influences on inflation rates are not expected to 
continue, and consumer price inflation is likely to be more strongly influenced again by 
core components (excluding energy and food). In this respect, underlying price 
pressures remain strong. Core inflation in the group of advanced economies stood at 
3.1 % in October.
1.3 International financial markets characterised by key interest rate 
cuts
Ongoing disinflation and political uncertainty shaped events in the financial 
markets. Amid further improvements in inflation data and weaker economic signals, 
market participants initially adjusted their policy rate expectations for the United States 
and the euro area significantly downwards. For a time, market participants considered 
a pronounced rate-cutting cycle and thus an early end to restrictive monetary policy 
likely, which resulted in ten-year yields in the capital markets of major currency areas 
falling sharply. The beginning of the fourth quarter saw market participants’ expecta-
tions of policy rate cuts in the medium term being dampened by unexpectedly robust 
labour market and economic data in the United States, as well as the prospect of  US
budget deficits potentially being high. Term premia for longer-term  bonds US
increased, too. This rise was transmitted to interest rates in the euro area to a limited 
extent. At the end of the reporting period, ten-year government bond yields were 
mixed in relation to their end-June levels. However, the yield spread between the 
United States and the euro area increased. This contributed to the euro depreciating 
against the  dollar. The euro also depreciated slightly in effective terms against 18 US
trading partners.
The differing economic outlooks were clearly reflected in the international equity 
markets, with strong price gains in the United States and price falls in the euro area 
and Japan.  The nascent rate-cutting cycle and investors’ risk appetite, which has been 
growing again since mid-August, supported prices around the world. In the United 
States, especially, the assets of listed companies increased significantly. Market partici-
pants expect that the profits of listed companies – especially those of financial corpora-
tions – will benefit from the new  government’s policy measures. In the euro area, by US

Overview
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 8contrast, lower profit expectations and the looming prospect of tariffs dampened price 
movements. Amid growing risk appetite amongst investors, the yield spreads of long-
term government bonds in the euro area and, in particular, corporate bonds fell.

Overview
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 92 Monetary policy and banking business
2.1  Governing Council cuts key interest rates furtherECB
At its monetary policy meetings in September and October 2024, the ECB Governing 
Council adopted two interest rate cuts. The deposit facility rate – the rate though 
which the Governing Council steers the monetary policy stance – was lowered by 25 
basis points twice, reaching 3.25 %. Amongst other reasons, the Governing Council justi-
fied the interest rate cuts based on the fact that incoming data and the newly prepared 
September projections had confirmed the previous inflation outlook. It expects inflation 
to rise in the coming months, before declining to target in the course of next year. It 
nevertheless also stressed that domestic inflation remains high, as wages continue to 
rise at an elevated pace.
Adjustments to the monetary policy framework came into force with effect from 
18 September 2024. The spread between the rate on the main refinancing operations 
and the deposit facility rate was reduced from 50 to 15 basis points. The spread 
between the rate on the marginal lending facility and the rate on the main refinancing 
operations remained unchanged at 25 basis points.
2.2 Demand for loans to enterprises in the euro area remains subdued
The rebound in monetary growth continued in the third quarter, but demand for 
loans to enterprises remained subdued.  The recovery in the broad monetary aggre-
gate  observed since autumn 2023 continued, with annual growth rising to 3.2 % at M3
the end of September 2024. This increase is related to the monetary policy interest rate 
cuts: the changed interest rate environment reduced the attractiveness to investors of 
longer-term investment forms relative to their more liquid  counterparts. On the M3
counterpart side, strong inflows from abroad were once again the main factor buoying 
monetary growth. With regard to bank lending, loans to households, which had been 
trending upwards since the autumn of 2023, gained in strength. Meanwhile, there are 
still no signs of a marked recovery in loans to non-financial corporations. This was due 

Overview
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 10primarily to the fact that many enterprises were able to finance their investments inter-
nally. Consistent with this, the Bank Lending Survey  indicates that demand for ( )BLS
loans to enterprises edged only marginally higher in the third quarter.

Overview
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 113 German economy
3.1 Slight rise in German economic output in the third quarter
The rise in German economic output in the third quarter of 2024 came as a surprise. 
However, the outlook remains poor.  According to the flash estimate by the Federal 
Statistical Office, seasonally adjusted real  rose by 0.2 % on the previous quarter. GDP
Although this exceeded earlier expectations, the second-quarter decline in  was GDP
revised from 0.1 % to 0.3 %. Economic output thus remained weak overall in the 
summer half-year. In addition, it is difficult to derive an improvement to the underlying 
cyclical trend from the third-quarter increase in  According to data from the . GDP
Federal Statistical Office, rising government and private consumption expenditure was 
the main contributor, but, given the mixed picture for indicators for private consump-
tion, this is expected to have increased only slightly. Thus, at the current time, none of 
the key demand components give any cause to expect a marked short-term recovery in 
the German economy. Private consumption benefited from the steep rise in wages in 
the third quarter but the labour market is becoming increasingly gloomy and the high 
level of consumer uncertainty – probably partly a result of said gloom – is likely to have 
dampened its growth. Exports, as well as output in the industrial sector and in construc-
tion, continued to decline. The still elevated financing costs and pronounced economic 
policy uncertainty were still weighing on investment and thus on demand for construc-
tion and capital goods. In addition, the fact that capacity utilisation is now very low was 
an additional drag on the propensity to invest in the industrial sector. In view of 
German industry’s deteriorating competitive position, no growth impetus came from 
the expanding German sales markets abroad. The industrial sector is under high 
pressure to adapt to changing structural conditions at domestic production sites and in 
global markets. The German automotive sector is particularly affected by this structural 
change.

Overview
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 123.2 Growth in German banks’ lending business
German banks’ lending business with the domestic non-financial private sector 
grew slightly in the third quarter. There are signs of a weak upward movement in 
lending to households for house purchase. The  indicates that households’ more BLS
upbeat assessment of housing market prospects and the decline in the general interest 
rate level in this segment contributed to demand. Lending business with the non-finan-
cial corporate sector, on the other hand, saw only minimal growth. Given the high level 
of uncertainty and their still sufficient stock of internal financing, German firms’ 
demand for external financing remained subdued. The banks surveyed in the  had BLS
not tightened their corporate lending policies for the first time in just under three years.
3.3 Labour market cooled off in the summer, but wages still rising 
sharply
The protracted economic weakness also reached the hitherto very robust labour 
market in the third quarter.  Employment declined slightly from its previous record 
highs. Strong sectoral differentiation continued. Manufacturing and trade jobs fell. By 
contrast, labour demand for services remained high, although in some segments 
employment was likewise increasing at a slower pace than previously. Unemployment 
continued to climb. While short-time work has increasingly been made use of in 
manufacturing for some time now, it still plays no major role in the overall economy. 
The outlook remains muted. According to leading indicators, there will be neither a 
significant improvement nor a major deterioration in the labour market situation in the 
coming months.
Negotiated wages saw a very strong increase in the third quarter.  Including ancillary 
agreements, they went up by 8.8 % on the year in the third quarter. This is the highest 
year-on-year growth rate since the summer of 1993. It was mainly driven by very steep 
negotiated wage adjustments in the retail sector as well as in wholesale and foreign 
trade. These sectors negotiated high permanent wage increases, back payments and 
an inflation compensation bonus. Even disregarding these special payments and 
looking exclusively at basic remuneration levels, negotiated wages went up by 5.6 % 
year on year in the third quarter, once again outpacing the second-quarter increase. 
The phase of very high wage increases may have peaked in the third quarter, however. 
Actual earnings also look to have increased substantially.

Overview
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 13High wage demands are coinciding with a weak economic setting.  At present, trade 
unions’ wage demands are relatively high as, now that inflation compensation bonus 
payments have ceased, they are aiming to offset the losses in purchasing power that 
have occurred in recent years by securing permanent wage increases. However, the 
recently agreed wage increase in the metals and electrical engineering industry was 
fairly moderate, at 2.2 % per annum, given the strong deterioration in that sector’s 
economic situation. Given the prolonged period of economic weakness and signifi-
cantly lower inflation rates, the other forthcoming wage negotiations are, on the whole, 
expected to result in distinctly lower agreements than in the past two years.
3.4 Inflation rate likely to be temporarily somewhat higher around end 
of this year and start of next
Consumer prices did not rise as sharply as before in the third quarter.  Measured in 
terms of the  they rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.3 % in the third quarter, only , HICP
just less than half as much as in the previous two quarters. Energy prices actually saw a 
marked drop. Industrial goods excluding energy became moderately more expensive. 
Services price inflation came down a little, yet remained unusually high. Food price infla-
tion even intensified again. Year-on-year upward price pressures subsided. The 
headline inflation rate dropped from 2.6 % to 2.2 %. This was due not only to the declin-
ing energy prices in the third quarter of 2024, but also to a dampening base effect 
caused by the rise in energy prices in the third quarter of 2023. By contrast, the core 
rate excluding energy and food (3.1 %) remained almost as high as in the previous 
quarter.
Inflation was significantly higher again in October.  Annual headline inflation rose 
from 1.8 % in September to 2.4 %. This was partly because energy prices came down 
markedly in October 2023, which was reflected as a base effect in inflation in 
October 2024, driving up the rate. The core rate likewise went up significantly from 
3.0 % to 3.3 %. However, factoring out the volatile prices of travel and also clothing, the 
rate remained virtually unchanged at 3 %.
Inflation is expected to be somewhat higher still for a time.  Energy prices fell signifi-
cantly at the end of 2023. Viewed in isolation, this downward movement in the base 
year will push up inflation in the coming months. As regards travel services, dampening 
base effects no longer apply – here, too, prices dropped considerably in the previous 
year. As a result, the inflation rate is likely to go up considerably further still for a 

Overview
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 14temporary period. At the beginning of next year, one-off effects will also have a price-
driving effect. These include the price rise for the “Deutschlandticket” and probably also 
substantial increases in private health insurance tariffs. Without these one-off effects, 
the core rate is likely to gradually trend downwards. The strong wage growth in 2024 
will keep inflation high, however, especially for services.
3.5 German economy likely to remain weak in fourth quarter, too
The lull in activity in the German economy is likely to persist in the fourth quarter as 
well.  Industry and construction are likely to remain a dampener on economic output. 
Factors weighing on the propensity to invest, such as high uncertainty, financing costs 
that are still relatively high and low capacity utilisation in industry, remain in place. 
Foreign demand for German industrial products is still weak, even if a recovery is 
imminent here. According to  Institute surveys, the share of firms in the main ifo
construction sector reporting a shortage of orders remained high in October, and 
equipment utilisation declined again slightly on the previous quarter. The labour 
market will probably continue to cool, with moderately declining employment and a 
slight rise in unemployment. Nevertheless, private consumption could expand again 
somewhat, as the sharply higher wages offer further scope for additional consumer 
spending. Consumers remain unsettled, however, and will probably make only tenta-
tive use of their additional scope for spending. All in all, economic output could be 
more or less stagnant in the fourth quarter.

Overview
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 154 German public finances
4.1 At present, slightly shrinking deficit anticipated for 2024 and 2025
The government deficit is likely to decline slightly this year and next in the absence 
of new decisions. However, a new course is likely to be set after the general election.
This slight decline is driven by major divergent developments. The gradual expiry of 
temporary assistance in response to the energy crisis will reduce the deficit. In 2023, 
this assistance added around 1½ % of  to the deficit (total deficit for 2023 overall: GDP
2.6 % of  By contrast, considerable additional expenditure in many places is ). GDP
pushing up the deficit. For example, the Armed Forces Fund is likely to spend signifi-
cantly more than in 2023. Similar developments are also visible in climate policy and, in 
particular, in the generation of electricity from renewable energy sources. Personnel 
expenditure is still rising significantly, especially in the wake of the high inflation of 
recent years, with the public sector lagging behind the private sector. In addition, weak 
economic developments are temporarily driving up labour market-related expenditure. 
Spending on pensions, healthcare and long-term care will probably rise dynamically. 
Overall, after a perceptible surplus in 2023, social security funds are likely to run deficits 
this year and next, despite sharply rising contribution rates to the health and long-term 
care insurance schemes.
4.2 Collapse of government will not require restrictive fiscal policy
The collapse of the governing coalition will not require restrictive fiscal policy. 
However, the fiscal challenges facing the new Federal Government will be consider-
able.  The general government budget is developing more positively in the current year 
than planned. Given the appropriate parliamentary majorities, certain fiscal policy 
leeway could be used by adopting a supplementary budget for 2024. The 2025 budget 
will probably have to be passed by a newly elected parliament, however. Until then, the 
rules for interim management of the budget will apply for 2025. These rules protect the 
government’s ability to meet existing obligations, thereby ensuring relatively stable 

Overview
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 16fiscal policy. The Federal Government could take extrabudgetary measures in response 
to foreseeable and unavoidable needs. Greater political scope would then be opened 
up by the central government budget for 2025 and the new medium-term financial 
planning, which would need to be prepared taking national and European fiscal rules 
into account.
4.3 Sound public finances key to ensuring resilience and scope for action
From the Bundesbank’s perspective, sound public finances are key to ensuring fiscal 
policy and macroeconomic resilience and tackling the current challenges.  Sound 
public finances are not the antithesis of healthy macroeconomic developments, but 
instead a precondition. It is important to prioritise spending and ensure sufficient 
revenue.
Binding fiscal rules are intended to ensure sound public finances. A reform of the 
debt brake with moderately higher borrowing scope given a low debt ratio would be 
entirely justifiable.  The Bundesbank has made proposals for a stability-oriented 
reform of the debt brake. A binding credit limit remains key. However, if the debt ratio 
is below 60 %, this limit could be higher than before. In this context, special expenditure 
could be given privileged treatment by dedicating part of the borrowing scope exclu-
sively to it. The Bundesbank proposes a two-tiered credit limit for this purpose.
Sound and rule-based public finances in Germany promote stability in the euro area.  
That is another reason why Germany should rigorously apply the new  fiscal rules to EU
itself. Only in that way can the Federal Government credibly campaign for the applica-
tion of the rules throughout the  in a stability-oriented manner. The deficit and debt EU
ratios in some Member States remain high, in some cases persistently. The new rules 
are designed to bring them down in a reliable manner. However, the requirements for 
country-specific budgetary limits have already proven to be highly complicated. 
Moreover, the procedure in which the Member State, the European Commission and
 set the budgetary limits is fairly opaque. Going forward, it will be necessary to Ecofin
establish clear requirements, to explain them clearly and concisely, and to implement 
them. In order to strengthen confidence in sound public finances in the euro area, it is 
important that the reformed rules get off to a good start.

Setting

Global and European Setting
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 181 Global economy still sluggish
The global economy remained on a moderate growth path in the third quarter of 
2024.  The United States was yet again its main pillar.  gross domestic product  US ( ) GDP
continued to rise significantly in the third quarter after price and seasonal adjustment, 
while Chinese economic activity was once again anaemic, not least because of the 
ongoing crisis in the real estate market. In the euro area, economic output increased 
markedly, mainly due to one-off effects, whereas, in the United Kingdom and Japan, 
growth tailed off perceptibly in the third quarter.
The recent improvement in industry is unlikely to last.  As in the second quarter, 
global industrial output rose perceptibly in the summer months, too. The Asian 
economies, which are highly integrated into international value chains, played a key 
role in this. Global trade in goods accordingly expanded even more buoyantly. Emerg-
ing and advanced economies alike again noticeably increased their exports and 
imports. However, frontloading effects appear to have played a role in this. In the previ-
ous quarter, companies had already restocked their inventories in the context of possi-
ble trade policy frictions and the threat of disruptions to shipping.  It thus remains to 
be seen whether the recent upswing will prove sustainable. This is also reflected by 
recent purchasing managers’ surveys, according to which output growth in the 
manufacturing sector has globally come to a standstill as of late and order books have 
continued to shrink. Looking ahead, political demands for new tariff barriers pose 
considerable additional risks to international trade. 1)

Global and European Setting
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 19The International Monetary Fund ( )IMF  also recently maintained its subdued growth 
outlook for the global economy and emphasised the prevalence of political risks. In 
the October World Economic Outlook, the  staff confirmed its global economic IMF
growth forecast of 3.2 % for this year.  This pace, moderate by longer-term standards, 
is expected to be broadly maintained in 2025. The staff adjusted its inflation forecast 
for advanced economies slightly downwards. In 2025, inflation could stabilise near 
monetary policy target rates. The risks to this economic outlook are assessed as being 
tilted to the downside, however. Not least, protectionist measures could entail signifi-
cant losses in global growth.
Given the mediocre economic outlook and geopolitical tensions, commodity prices 
have recently been on an uneven trajectory.  Crude oil prices recently declined 
markedly. In the first half of November, a barrel of Brent crude oil cost $75 on US
average, and thus around 9 % less than in August. Demand concerns are likely to have 
been the main driver of this decline. The International Energy Agency estimates that 
there could be a distinct global oil glut next year.  Given the outlook of ample supplies

Global and European Setting
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 20going forward, tensions in the Middle East have only led to moderate and temporary 
price spikes. In contrast to oil prices, European gas prices have recently risen slightly. 
Seasonally rising demand, maintenance-related production losses in Norway and 
supply concerns are propping prices up. Prices for industrial metals and food commodi-
ties have also risen somewhat recently. The boost in demand expected in connection 
with China’s economic stimulus measures were a significant factor in this.
The disinflation process is continuing, but underlying price pressures are still high . 
In the advanced economies, the year-on-year increase in consumer prices went down 
to 2.4 % by October. Three months earlier, this figure stood at 2.8 %. Energy price reduc-
tions contributed significantly to this decline. Such dampening influences on inflation 
rates are not expected to continue over the rest of the year, and consumer price infla-
tion is likely to be more strongly influenced again by core components (excluding 
energy and food). In this respect, underlying price pressures remain strong. Core infla-

In China, economic growth remained muted in the third quarter.  Real  growth GDP
continued to weaken slightly in the third quarter, slowing to 4.6 % on the year. Growth 
picked up somewhat over the quarter but failed to display much momentum. Private 
consumption, in particular, continued its slump. Nominal retail sales rose by just 2.7 % 
on the year. The sharp downturn in the housing market also continued. The official 
price index for existing dwellings, which comprises 70 large cities, fell by just under 
15 % from its 2021 peak. At the same time, the floor space of new building projects 
declined by two-thirds. Cement production, often regarded as a barometer of construc-
tion sector activity, was almost 12 % lower in the third quarter than a year ago. Against 
this backdrop, it is astonishing that, according to official data, construction output is 
said to have contributed positively to aggregate growth throughout the reporting 
period. Meanwhile, consumer price trends have remained extremely subdued. In 
October, the headline index was only 0.3 % higher than a year earlier. Even excluding 
energy and food, inflation came to a near-standstill.


Global and European Setting
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 22Exports remained a pillar of China’s economy.  On average over the June to October 
period, revenues from goods exports (in  dollar terms) increased by just under 8 % US
year-on-year. In real terms, the increase appears to have even been significantly higher 
owing to price reductions. Against this backdrop, competitive pressure from China on 
international markets is likely to have intensified further, especially for advanced 
economies (see the supplementary information entitled "Competitive pressure from 
China on Germany and other advanced economies").

Competitive pressure from China on Germany and 
other advanced economies
Chinese goods, especially tech products, have been making major inroads into 
global markets of late.  Over the last few years, China has increasingly managed to 
catch up with the leading economies in the field of technology. This could partly be due 
to its government’s industrial policy, which has first and foremost provided targeted 
and large-scale backing to strategically important industrial sectors. In addition to 
greater performance and competitiveness, the relative post-pandemic sluggishness of 
domestic demand has also given China’s industrial sector a key incentive to focus more 
on foreign markets. Overall, China has gained significant global market share for many 
high-tech products, in particular, and has continued to expand its position as the 
world's leading exporter. At last count, just under 15 % of global goods exports came 
from China.
Given this surge in exports, China is probably exerting significantly more competi-
tive pressure on the advanced economies. The boom in China’s exports after it joined 
the World Trade Organization  in 2001 was fuelled primarily by labour-intensive ( ) WTO
products such as textiles and, for the advanced economies, was mainly associated with 
an increase in imports from China. By contrast, China’s latest advance is likely to 
encroach more on core industries in the advanced economies and cause them large 
losses in export markets. As a result, some observers are already talking about a “China 
shock 2.0”.
To model the development of competitive pressure from China on the export 
economies of specific countries, we use our own indicator, which consolidates gran-
ular foreign trade data. The analysis incorporates highly granular foreign trade data 1) 
 2) 
 3) 1 See, for example, Krugman (2024).
2 The indicator was presented in Deutsche Bundesbank (2018b). The reference dataset has been refined since 
then.

Global and European Setting
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 24 from around 100 countries since 2011. In order to calculate competitive pressure 
from China for a given country, we weight China’s share of global exports in each 
product category by that category’s share of the respective country's total exports.  
The indicator points to high competitive pressure whenever China holds large global 
market shares in particularly significant export sectors of a given country. It thus 
complements the price competitiveness indicators that the Bundesbank calculates, 
which incorporate macroeconomic relative price and productivity levels, taking into 
account the importance of the respective regional trade structure.
According to the analysis, competitive pressure from China has increased signifi-
cantly in recent years, especially on Germany.  The competitiveness indicator calcu-
lated in this way for Germany rose from just under 9 % in 2011 to 13 % in 2021, where it 
has remained since then. This means that China’s global market share in the sectors 
relevant to the German export industry increased by just over 4 percentage points on a 
weighted average. In the other  countries, this increase was less pronounced. G7
However, measured by the most recent indicator a number of countries were exposed 
to significantly greater competitive pressure from China than Germany. These included 
several Asian economies such as Taiwan and South Korea, as well as a number of 
Eastern European countries including Poland and Czechia. Conversely, competition with 
China was less intense for countries such as the United States and Canada because the 
latter also export various commodities and agricultural goods that barely feature 
among China’s range of exports. 3)

tion and Coding System ( ), which enables a breakdown for just under 6,000 different products.HS
4 The indicator used here measures competitive pressure from China on the world market. It therefore ignores 
the specific competitive conditions in the individual sales markets of an exporting country, which are also 
shaped by bilateral trade frictions such as geographical distance, tariffs or non-tariff barriers to trade.
5 Such indicators currently classify Germany’s price competitiveness as neutral and China’s price competitive-
ness as unfavourable but markedly improved over the past three years; see the article entitled , Financial markets

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 25The automotive sector, amongst others, has recently added to mounting competi-
tive pressure from China on Germany.  This reflects the fact that Chinese exporters 
increased their global market share in this sector, which is very important for Germany, 
from 4 % in 2017 to just over 10 % in 2023.  China’s significant gains in market share in 
mechanical engineering and chemical products also contributed to more intense 
competition. That said, China’s global market shares have not changed significantly in 
recent years in other sectors that are significant for Germany, such as pharmaceutical 
products.
Competitive pressure from China on Germany and other advanced economies is set 
to intensify further over the next few years.  China’s market shares in many high-tech 
sectors such as aviation are still comparatively low at present, and the country's leaders 
continue to pursue an extremely active industrial policy. In the automotive sector, in

manufacturers. As a number of German manufacturers also export from China, this could somewhat overstate 
the competitive pressure measured for Germany. On the other hand, of course, the indicator fails to reflect 
the considerable competitive pressure on German cars produced in China for the Chinese market, which is 
likely to be very large at present. For more information, see the supplementary information entitled “Recent 
developments in Germany’s automotive industry” in the section on the German economy in this Monthly 
Report.

the leap. 7)

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 27The Chinese authorities have recently launched extensive monetary and fiscal policy 
measures in order to jump-start domestic demand and mitigate financial risk.  The 
Chinese central bank recently adopted a series of expansionary monetary policy 
measures, including cuts in policy rates and the minimum reserve rate. The govern-
ment also announced further measures to support the real estate sector. In early 
November, it also unveiled a large debt restructuring programme with a view to reduc-
ing local governments’ piles of off-balance-sheet debt.
1.2 Mixed developments in other emerging market economies
In India, economic activity may have continued to cool off recently.  Annual  GDP
growth had already slowed markedly to 6.7 % in the second quarter of 2024. Recent 
monthly indicators are pointing to a further deceleration, with the business climate 
deteriorating markedly, particularly in the services sector. Consumer price inflation 
rose markedly to 6.2 % in October, due primarily to a surge in food prices. This put the 
inflation rate somewhat outside the central bank’s target corridor. The central bank had 
previously left its policy rate unchanged at 6.5 %.
Brazil’s economy still seems to be riding high.  Real  had already grown surpris- GDP
ingly strongly in the first half of 2024; it was up by 3.3 % on the year in the second 
quarter. The upswing was broad-based, also supported by expansionary fiscal policy. 
The latest indicators continue to point to a vigorous expansion. However, this could 
also lead to a resurgence in inflation. Inflation rose markedly in recent months to 4.8 % 
in October. Against this backdrop, the central bank raised its policy rate by a total of 75 
basis points to 11.25 % in September and October, bucking the global trend.
In Russia, economic growth weakened markedly amid increasing supply-side bottle-
necks.  According to data from Rosstat, real  growth declined in the third quarter of GDP
2024 to 3.1 % on the year, compared with 4.1 % a quarter earlier. The tight labour 
market, in particular, is likely to have dragged down growth. The unemployment rate 
held steady at the historically low level of 2.4 %. Against this backdrop, wage growth 
stayed extremely strong, while the government maintained its accommodative fiscal 
policy stance. All in all, the risks of an overheating economy are still high. Annual 
consumer price inflation continued to accelerate, reaching 8.9 % in the third quarter. 
This prompted the central bank to further tighten its monetary policy reins sharply. 
Since September, it has hiked its policy rate by a total of 300 basis points to 21 %.

In the United States, economic growth remained buoyant in the summer months.  
According to initial estimates, seasonally and price-adjusted  rose once again by GDP
0.7 % on the quarter in the third quarter. Households remained in a purchasing mood 
and sharply increased their consumer expenditure. Government demand showed 
similar dynamics. At the same time, firms continued to significantly expand their invest-
ment in machinery and equipment. Only construction investment saw a setback, with 
financing conditions remaining unfavourable.  Exports likewise flourished. Frontload-
ing effects could well have been at play here given the threat, at times, of strikes at 
major  ports. Imports increased even more strongly than exports, against the US
background of very brisk final demand across the board.
The short-term outlook for the US economy is also quite favourable. This applies, not 
least, to consumption. After a distinct upward revision of disposable income in the 
annual revision of the macroeconomic accounts, consumers appear to have greater 
scope for spending than previously assumed. They are therefore also likely to be able 
to cope if the labour market continues to slow down. There are still no signs of a drastic 
deterioration in the labour market situation (see the supplementary information 
entitled “ ”). Employ- On the economic implications of the  labour market slowdownUS
ment growth continued at a slower pace in October, despite impairments caused by 
hurricanes and labour disputes in the aviation industry. The unemployment rate 
remained low. Early sentiment indicators confirm that the  economy has gotten the US
final quarter of the year off to a good start. Moreover, the possibility of deregulation 
initiatives by the incoming  administration and the prospect of tax cuts could prop US
up sentiment in the corporate sector. On the other hand, the trade and immigration 
policy proposals pose considerable downside risks.
Given the booming economy, it remains to be seen whether the disinflation process 
will progress rapidly.  In October, the year-on-year rate of the consumer price index 
even rose slightly to 2.6 %. The core rate remained at 3.3 %, particularly as a result of  4)

high-technology sector, stimulated by government incentives, appears to be dissipating. See Deutsche Bundes-
bank (2023b) for more details.

On the economic implications of the  labour market US
slowdown
Signs of deterioration in the labour market in the United States caused widespread 
economic concerns in the middle of the year. Financial markets, in particular, reacted 
nervously to data releases perceived as disappointing. Indeed, employment growth 
slowed markedly for a while, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.2 % on average 
between June and August. A year earlier, it had been just over ½ percentage point 
lower. An increase of this size in the unemployment rate has in the past been a fairly 
reliable indicator of a downturn in the economy as a whole. The Sahm rule, named 
after its inventor, produces a warning signal for every recession dated by the National 
Bureau of Economic Research since 1965. Only once – in 1976 – does it produce what 
turns out to be a false alarm (see Chart 1.7). 1) 
1 The Sahm rule warns of a recession if the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate exceeds its 
minimum over the previous 12 months by at least 0.5 percentage point. See Sahm (2019).

the pandemic. In mid-2022, up to two job vacancies per unemployed person were 
recorded. Since then, the labour market has returned to a better balance, particularly 
as a result of an increase in the labour supply. This was due in part to strong immigra-
tion, which also supported economic growth.  The rise in the unemployment rate also 
largely reflects this increase in the potential labour force. By contrast, there was no 
wave of layoffs typical of an economic downturn. The number of employed persons of 
normal working age continued its upward trend. This contrasts with the employment 
losses in the context of earlier warning signals under the Sahm rule (see Chart 1.8, left 
panel).

quarter, real  in the United States rose by 0.7 % on the quarter in seasonally and GDP
price-adjusted terms. The pace of growth was actually slightly faster than in the first 
half of the year. Many other indicators – including those used by the National Bureau of 
Economic Research to date economic cycles – confirm a picture of an economic situa-
tion that is more than solid.  Accordingly, an econometric model based on this 
broader set of data classifies the probability that the  economy is currently in a reces-US
sion as negligible.  In the past, however, it has mostly indicated an increased 
downturn risk earlier than the Sahm rule (see Chart 1.8, right panel). In fact, earlier 
signals from the Sahm rule often occurred in phases in which the  economy was US
already in recession from today’s perspective. Then again, the rule was not designed as

be taken as having a high level of forecasting power for the short-term macroeconomic 
outlook.
Ultimately, there is little cause for greater concern about an imminent recession in 
the United States at present.  Initial sentiment indicators were also favourable at the 
beginning of the final quarter. Recent signals from the labour market confirm this 
picture. Wage and employment growth continued despite hurricanes and labour 
disputes. The unemployment rate has also gone back down since August. In October, 
there were therefore no further warning signals under the Sahm rule. This means that 
there is still much to suggest a “soft landing” for the  economy. However, some risks US
to this outlook remain – not least on the political side. For example, a tough immigra-
tion policy could curb both economic and employment growth. 5)

Sahm (2019).

Japan’s economic output increased slightly in the third quarter . According to initial 
estimates,  grew by 0.2 % in seasonally and price-adjusted terms. The economic GDP
recovery thus slowed down perceptibly. One reason for this was interruptions to 
production in the manufacturing sector caused in part by inclement weather.  Indus-
trial investment accordingly declined somewhat, and exports expanded only moder-
ately. By contrast, imports continued to grow markedly. Private consumption also 
remained lively, buoyed by strong wage growth. The labour market situation continued 
to be favourable. The unemployment rate stood at 2.4 % in September, close to its all-
time low. Inflation weakened somewhat, but remained high by Japanese standards. In 
September, consumer prices were up by 2.5 % year-on-year. Excluding energy and 
food, this figure stood at 1.7 %. The Japanese central bank left its policy rate unchanged 
at 0.25 % in October.
1.5 Growth in the United Kingdom perceptibly lost pace
The UK economy expanded far less vigorously in the third quarter than in the first 
half of the year.  According to initial estimates,  went up by 0.1 % in seasonally and GDP
price-adjusted terms compared with the fourth quarter. Business activity in the services 
sector, which holds a key position in the country’s economy, was unable to maintain the 
quite strong growth recorded in the first half of the year and expanded only slightly in 
the third quarter. By contrast, construction activity rose considerably after having 
declined in the three preceding quarters. Production in the manufacturing sector 
expanded somewhat. Labour market tensions eased given the macroeconomic 
slowdown. The number of vacancies declined throughout the reporting period, which 
appears to have contributed to a distinct reduction in annual wage growth to 4.2 % at 
the end of the period under review. The annual Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (
 rate fell further to 1.7 % in September, and the core rate also dropped slightly to ) HICP
3.2 %. Against this backdrop, the Bank of England cut its policy rate in early November 
by 25 basis points to 4.75 %. 5)

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 351.6 Polish economic activity cooling off
In Poland, economic activity cooled off significantly in the third quarter following a 
strong first half.  Real  contracted by 0.2 % on the quarter in seasonally adjusted GDP
terms, following an average increase of 0.9 % in the first two quarters. The decline is 
probably due in part to the impact of floods in September. While services sector activity 
continued to expand quite strongly in the third quarter, production of intermediate and 
capital goods fell markedly. Private consumption was adversely affected when support 
measures that had capped the prices households paid for energy expired towards the 
middle of the year. The inflation rate consequently rose from 2.6 % in June to 4.9 % in 
September. This was a drag on households’ purchasing power, although gross wages in 
the corporate sector continued to go up, increasing by just over 10 % year-on-year. 
Retail sales thus rose only moderately after price adjustment. Investment activity 
seems to have expanded once again, supported by payments from the  Fund, NGEU
whereas construction output fell anew. The unemployment rate rose slightly to 2.9 %. 
The National Bank of Poland left its policy rate unchanged at 5.75 %.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 362 Moderate upward trend in euro area economic activity
The euro area economy expanded perceptibly in the third quarter of 2024. According 
to Eurostat’s flash estimate,  rose by 0.4 % on the quarter after price and seasonal GDP
adjustment. Excluding Ireland, the rise was by 0.3 %. Various services sectors expanded 
strongly, supported in part by temporary one-off effects such as the Olympic Games in 
France. Private consumption continued to recover, while manufacturing and construc-
tion remained mired in a slump. Overall, the underlying cyclical trend continued to 
point moderately upward. Moreover, leading indicators do not yet indicate any trend 
change. According to surveys, although consumption continued to brighten, the 
outlook for industry has deteriorated further. The moderately expanding global 
economy is likely to provide only a small stimulus for the euro area, not least because 
of the persistently weak competitiveness plaguing some areas of European industry. 
The many international conflicts, uncertainty about global trade policy and the reform 
gridlock in several Member States also stand in the way of a sustained uptick in 
economic growth.
Consumption has firmed.  Retail sales grew considerably in price-adjusted terms. 
Expenditure on services probably continued to rise, especially in the hospitality sector. 
By contrast, the number of new motor vehicle registrations declined considerably. This 
is likely to have been driven by consumer uncertainty about future environmental 
requirements for internal combustion vehicles and further support for purchases of 
hybrid or electric vehicles. Household incomes have improved once again. Purchasing 
power is likely to have risen significantly again as a result of the sharp rise in wage 
income and diminishing inflation. Consumer confidence continued to improve and 
nearly returned to its long-term average. However, according to surveys, the propen-
sity to save remained high throughout the reporting period. The high savings ratio by 
longer-term standards was due not only to high interest rates, real wealth losses result-
ing from the surge in inflation, as well as the wait-and-see attitude towards car 
purchases, but also increased demand for hedges against economic shocks.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 37Investment activity probably declined once again . Construction investment is likely 
to have fallen once again in the third quarter. Overall, the decline in construction 
output in July and August combined was less than in the previous quarter. However, 
the slump has now reached all sectors (building construction, civil engineering and the 
finishing trades). Investment in machinery and equipment also appears to be continu-
ing to sag. Capital goods producers’ domestic sales, after price adjustment, decreased 
once again in July and August. By contrast, expenditure on information and communica-
tion technologies  and on intellectual property products is likely to have risen ( )ICT
further as the trend to go digital continued.
Exports of goods to non-euro area countries are unlikely to have seen any increase.
Exports of capital goods and intermediate inputs stagnated at the beginning of the 
quarter in price-adjusted terms, and exports of consumer goods contracted. Looking at 
individual destination countries, exports to China, in particular, are likely to have fallen 
significantly in terms of value in the third quarter, but those to the United Kingdom 
probably fell slightly as well. Exports to the United States appear to have markedly lost 
steam. According to provisional balance of payments data, euro area services exports 
fell for July and August, even though the hospitality sector production index appears to 
indicate that tourism has remained buoyant. Imports of goods from non-euro area 
countries rose again in price-adjusted terms in the third quarter, but probably at a 
somewhat slower pace. Those of capital goods and consumer goods alike are likely to 
have increased by a smaller amount than in the previous quarter. Imports of intermedi-
ate goods probably fell slightly.
The manufacturing sector remained stuck in a slump.  Intermediate input production, 
in particular, fell markedly in the third quarter, as in the previous quarter. In addition, 
capital goods production declined slightly. By contrast, consumer goods production 
increased. On the whole, industrial production went down. In addition, industrial capac-
ity utilisation fell further below its long-term average. In addition to subdued invest-
ment activity in the euro area, weak international competitiveness remains a burden. 
European Commission survey indicators of competitiveness have deteriorated through-
out the reporting period. By contrast, producer price pressures have remained low.  6)

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 38Producer and import prices for intermediate inputs continued to decline year-on-year, 
but were somewhat higher than at the beginning of the year. For finished products, 
annual price increases diminished further.
Many services sectors remain on a growth path.  Business activity in the hotel and 
restaurant sector, in particular, is also likely to have increased due to buoyant tourism. 
In addition, the activities of business-related service providers as well as those in the ICT
sector probably continued to grow markedly. According to European Commission 
surveys, however, a shortage of labour continues to weigh on the services sector. The 
importance of insufficient demand as a factor limiting production increased somewhat 
in recent quarters, but remained below the long-term average.
Economic output rose in most Member States in the third quarter.  The pace of 
economic growth continues to differ considerably between countries. In some 
countries with persistently favourable labour markets and low inflation, household 
consumption rose quite significantly. Buoyant tourism supported activity, especially in 
the southern Member States. The dampening effects of weakness in manufacturing 
were noticeable in Germany, in particular.
In France, economic output rose markedly.  According to preliminary estimates, real
 increased by 0.4 % in the third quarter. The Olympics and Paralympics were a GDP
major driver of growth.  Private consumption, in particular, benefited. Services also 
saw considerably increased revenue from broadcast rights and ticket sales. The underly-
ing cyclical dynamics remained weak, though. Investment in construction and in 
machinery and equipment declined once again, whilst exports of goods and services 
fell markedly. 7)

Private consumption, which benefited from the increase in purchasing power, has 
probably provided a renewed slight boost. In addition, investment activity is likely to 
have recovered somewhat. By contrast, goods exports probably continued to fall, which 
also reflects the persistent weakness of Italian industry. As in the previous quarters, its 
output declined. By contrast, service providers’ activity rose.
Spain’s strong upswing continued.  According to an initial estimate, real  grew by GDP
0.8 % in the third quarter, thus remaining extremely dynamic. The recent growth was 
driven by an increase in private consumption, whereas investment slowed down. 
Exports and imports alike rose markedly. On the supply side, manufacturing output 
increased; that of services was even up significantly. By contrast, activity in the construc-
tion sector declined.
Economic output rose markedly in most of the smaller Member States as well.  In the 
Netherlands, real  has gone up perceptibly for the second time in a row, an appar- GDP
ent indication that the slump has been overcome. In Austria and Finland, too, activity 
increased again in the third quarter. In Ireland, Lithuania and Cyprus, real  once GDP

Slovenia. In Latvia, activity went down once again.
The labour market situation deteriorated slightly in the third quarter. The unemploy-
ment rate remained at its low of 6.3 % and the number of persons in employment once 
again rose slightly. Employment expectations, however, have been declining since 
March of this year and, for some months now, have already been under the long-term 
average. The job vacancy rate showed another marked drop, and labour hoarding fell. 
Wage growth is likely to once again have been comparatively high in the third quarter, 
standing at between 4 % and 5 % on the year. Wage growth is thus unlikely to moderate 
significantly in the second half of 2024.
Overall, consumer prices continued to rise moderately in the third quarter, despite 
declining energy prices. As measured by the  prices increased by 0.5 % compared , HICP
with the previous quarter after seasonal adjustment. Services inflation remained 
strong. Surging wage growth had a particularly strong impact here. Food prices 
likewise rose significantly, reflecting in part high food commodity prices caused, 
amongst other things, by bad weather at the end of the quarter. Non-energy industrial 
goods also became more expensive again following a quarter in which upward price 
pressures had ground to a complete halt. By contrast, energy prices fell significantly, 
not least because of lower crude oil prices.
On an annual basis, upward price pressures continued to decline. The inflation rate 
fell from 2.5 % to 2.2 % in the third quarter, with the disparity between goods and 
services continuing. Services inflation has remained stuck at around 4 % since the end 
of 2023. By contrast, the price dynamics of goods continued to cool off. For energy, 
they were even significantly negative. However, upward price pressures for food and 
non-energy industrial goods eased somewhat, too. For the latter, inflation was even 
slightly below its pre-crisis average. This underlines the general assessment that the 
disinflation process for non-energy industrial goods is likely to be largely complete, 
partly because producer prices for these goods did not fall any further up until the end 
of the reporting period.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 41As expected, inflation went back up markedly in October. According to Eurostat’s 
flash estimate, it rose from 1.7 % in September to 2.0 % in October. Food prices, in 
particular, rose more strongly than before. The year-on-year decline in energy prices 
narrowed, in part because crude oil prices had fallen in October 2023. Non-energy 
industrial goods inflation remained weak and services inflation remained high. The 
core rate therefore held steady at 2.7 %. In the coming months, the inflation rate is 
expected to go back up temporarily due to base effects from energy before then gradu-
ally falling over the course of next year.


Global and European Setting
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 42A slowdown in economic growth appears to be on the cards for the current quarter.  
The factors that had temporarily stimulated economic activity in the third quarter have 
now faded out. All else being equal, this will already reduce  growth in the fourth GDP
quarter. In addition, there is no end in sight yet to industry’s slump. According to both 
the Purchasing Managers’ Index for the manufacturing sector and the European 
Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator, output expectations in October remained 
markedly in contractionary territory or below their long-term average. In addition, new 
orders, especially from abroad, continued to decline. An imminent turnaround is likely 
to be hampered by various factors, including the persistently mediocre competitiveness 
of euro area industrial enterprises and a slowdown in global industrial activity. There 
are no signs of any noticeable increase in activity in the construction sector, either. 
According to surveys, order books in that sector have improved only slightly through-
out the reporting period. By contrast, service providers’ activity is likely to expand 
moderately. Admittedly, the outlook in some services sectors has recently deteriorated 
somewhat; however, the firming of private consumption is likely to stimulate trade. In 
addition, the ongoing trend towards digitalisation is supporting activity in the field of
 services and various business-related services. Against this backdrop, euro area ICT
economic activity is likely to remain on a moderate upward path.

Monetary policy and banking business
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 461 Monetary policy and money market developments
At its monetary policy meeting in September 2024, the Governing Council of the ECB 
lowered its key interest rates for the second time this year. The deposit facility 
rate – the rate through which the Governing Council steers the monetary policy 
stance – was lowered by 25 basis points to 3.5 %. Based on its updated assessment, the 
Governing Council considered it appropriate to take another step in moderating the 
degree of monetary policy restriction. Amongst other reasons, the Governing Council 
justified the cut in key interest rates based on the fact that inflation data had come in 
broadly as expected and the previous inflation outlook had been confirmed.  staff ECB
projections in September for headline inflation were unchanged against the June projec-
tions. Staff saw headline inflation averaging 2.5 % in 2024, 2.2 % in 2025 and 1.9 % in 
2026, as in the June projections. For core inflation, the projections for 2024 and 2025 
were revised up slightly compared with June, as services inflation had been higher than 
expected. Domestic inflation remains high as wages are still rising at an elevated pace, 
even if there are factors partially buffering the impact of wages on inflation.


Monetary policy and banking business
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 47As announced in March 2024, changes to the operational framework for implement-
ing monetary policy entered into force in September. Effective 18 September, the 
spread between the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the deposit 
facility rate was set at 15 basis points. The spread between the rate on the marginal 
lending facility and the rate on the main refinancing operations remained unchanged 
at 25 basis points. Following this change, the interest rate on the main refinancing 
operations stood at 3.65 % and the interest rate on the marginal lending facility stood 
at 3.90 %.
In October, the Governing Council lowered the key ECB interest rates once again by 
25 basis points. According to the Governing Council, the incoming information on infla-
tion showed that the disinflationary process was well on track. The inflation outlook 
was also affected by recent downside surprises in indicators of economic activity. The 
Governing Council expects inflation to rise in the coming months, before declining to 
target in the course of next year.
At both meetings, the Governing Council reiterated that it was not pre-committing 
to a particular rate path.  It is determined to ensure that inflation returns to its 2 % 
medium-term target in a timely manner and will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive 
for as long as necessary to achieve this aim. The Governing Council will continue to 
follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appro-
priate level and duration of restriction.
Short-term money market rates moved completely in line with both reductions in 
key interest rates. Following the cut in key interest rates in October, the euro short-
term rate  closed the reporting period at 3.162 %, which was around 9 basis ( ) €STR
points below the new level of the deposit facility rate.
Market participants are expecting to see an additional interest rate step in Decem-
ber and further rate cuts next year. In the Eurosystem’s Survey of Monetary Analysts 
conducted ahead of the October meeting, all respondents stated that they were expect-
ing a further rate cut of 25 basis points in December. For 2025, the median response 
indicated that three further interest rate cuts totalling 75 basis points are expected. At 
present, money market forward rates are likewise fully pricing in a rate cut of 25 basis 
points at the December meeting in addition to four further interest rate cuts by the 
middle of next year.
Monetary policy securities holdings shrank further as of mid-August. This was again 
because assets held under the asset purchase programme  matured and were not ( )APP
reinvested. In addition, since the second half of the year, the Eurosystem has also not

Excess liquidity declined further. At last count, it stood at €2,957 billion. The contrac-

 assets likewise caused excess liquidity to shrink. Excess liquidity was also influ- PEPP
enced by developments in autonomous factors (see the supplementary information 
entitled “Money market management and liquidity needs”).

Monetary policy and banking business
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 49Supplementary information
Money market management and liquidity needs
In the reporting period from 24 July to 22 October 2024,  excess liquidity in the 
Eurosystem decreased by a total of €124.2 billion to an average of €2,995.2 billion, 
though it remained at a high level. This decline was driven mainly by voluntary early 
repayments and maturing securities under the third series of targeted longer-term 
refinancing operations  III) as well as the decrease in the outstanding volume of (TLTRO
bonds under the asset purchase programmes.
Compared with the fourth reserve maintenance period of 2024 (June-July 2024), liquid-
ity needs in the Eurosystem stemming from autonomous factors (see Table 2.1) fell by 
€28.7 billion to an average of €1,294.9 billion in the sixth reserve maintenance period of 
2024 (September-October 2024). Without this liquidity-providing effect, excess liquidity 
would have contracted even more sharply. The decline in liquidity needs was caused 
primarily by the increase of €31.6 billion (of which €16.9 billion was attributable to 
Germany) in the sum of net foreign assets and other factors. These two variables are 
considered together owing to liquidity-neutral valuation effects. By contrast, the 
€2.4 billion increase in government deposits had a liquidity-absorbing effect. In 
Germany, the rise in net banknote issuance of €11.4 billion to €941.1 billion repre-
sented the strongest liquidity-absorbing effect among the autonomous factors. Over 
the period under review, the minimum reserve requirement in the Eurosystem 
increased by €1.0 billion to €162.9 billion, which marginally raised the need for central 
bank liquidity. By contrast, the reserve requirement went down by €0.2 billion to 
€44.4 billion in Germany. Euro area commercial banks held 95 % of their central bank 
liquidity in the deposit facility (in Germany: 96 %). 1)

The average outstanding tender volume in the euro area decreased by €53.7 billion to 
€57.0 billion during the reporting period. The maturity date for  III.9 and a volun- TLTRO
tary early repayment option for  III.10 fell within the period under review, on TLTRO
25 September 2024. A total of €47.3 billion matured and was repaid on that date. The 
volume in the regular main refinancing operations and three-month tenders remained 
at a low level overall. There were temporary increases in the volume under the main 
tender at the end of the quarter, which were accompanied by  III.9 expiring in TLTRO
the third quarter. In Germany, the average outstanding volume of all refinancing opera-
tions fell by €6.6 billion to €9.8 billion in the period under review. This was partly due to 
maturities and voluntary early repayments under the  III operations in Septem- TLTRO
ber, amounting to €6.4 billion. German banks’ share in the outstanding volume of 
Eurosystem refinancing operations thus came to around 17 %, more than 2 percentage 
points higher than in the fourth reserve maintenance period of 2024.

In an environment of falling Eurosystem policy rates and declining excess liquidity, the 
spread between overnight rates in the euro money market and the deposit facility rate 
gradually narrowed further. The unsecured euro short-term rate  was set at an ( ) €STR
average of 3.66 % in the fifth reserve maintenance period of 2024, unchanged from the 
previous reserve maintenance period. Triggered by the Eurosystem’s interest rate cut 
in September, the average rate dropped to 3.41 % in the sixth reserve maintenance 
period of 2024. The transmission of monetary policy stimulus to the  was thus €STR
smooth and complete. Compared with the previous period, the average spread 
between the deposit facility rate and the  decreased by 0.7 basis point to 8.7 basis €STR
points in the fifth reserve maintenance period of 2024. In the sixth reserve mainte-
nance period of 2024, however, the spread remained almost unchanged at an average 
of 8.62 basis points. The voluntary repayment date for  III.10 and the narrowing TLTRO
of the spread between the interest rate on main refinancing operations and the deposit 
facility also fell within the sixth reserve maintenance period. Following the narrowing of 
the interest rate spread, the period under review saw higher volumes in the regular 
main refinancing operations and three-month tenders, although they remained at low 
levels. 
Average trading volumes were once again on the decline compared with the previous 
reserve maintenance periods. On average, €53.4 billion was traded in the fifth reserve 
maintenance period of 2024 and €48.1 billion was traded in the sixth reserve mainte- Table 2.2: Eurosystem purchase programmes

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 54nance period of 2024. By comparison, averages of €49 and €54 billion were traded in 
the third and fourth reserve maintenance periods, respectively. The slight downward 
trend since the peak in trading volumes in the spring of 2023 thus continued. At the 
end of July, August and September, the  fixing decreased by 1.2 basis point, 1.0 €STR
basis point and 0.5 basis point, respectively, meaning end-of-month effects weakened 
of late. Previous month-ends had resulted in a reduction in the fixing of around 2 basis 
points.
On Eurex Repo’s  Pooling trading platform, the spread between secured overnight GC
transaction rates and the deposit facility rate widened marginally during the period 
under review amid persistently high transaction volumes. As in the previous two 
periods, the  basket traded at an average of 3.73 % in the fifth reserve maintenance ECB
period of 2024. Triggered by the Eurosystem’s interest rate cut, this rate dropped to 
3.49 % in the sixth reserve maintenance period. In the  EXTended basket, which has ECB
a broader selection of securities with lower rating requirements for concluding repo 
transactions, the spread against the deposit facility rate remained constant at average 
rates of 3.74 % and 3.50 %. Averaging €9.6 billion, the daily volume of transactions in the
 basket likewise remained unchanged. By contrast, the volume in the  ECB ECB
EXTended basket increased again to €4.75 billion.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 552 Monetary developments in the euro area
The increase in monetary growth continued in the third quarter.  The annual growth 
rate of the broad monetary aggregate  has risen by 4½ percentage points since the M3
end of September 2023, closing the period under review at 3.2 % (see Chart 2.5). That 
increase is a reflection of reductions in monetary policy interest rates first being 
expected since the autumn of 2023 and then being gradually implemented as of 
June 2024. For investors, the changed interest rate environment has made longer-term 
non-  forms of investment less attractive relative to their more liquid counterparts M3
within the monetary aggregate. On the counterpart side, strong inflows from abroad 
were once again the main factor buoying monetary growth. With regard to bank 
lending, loans to households, which had been trending upwards since the autumn of 
2023, gained in strength. Meanwhile, there are still no signs of a marked recovery in 
loans to non-financial corporations. This was due primarily to the fact that many enter-
prises were able to finance their investments using internal funds. Consistent with this, 
the Bank Lending Survey  indicates that demand for loans to enterprises edged ( )BLS
only marginally higher in the third quarter.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 56Growth in money holdings was broadly spread across all components of .M3 As key 
interest rates were reduced, the previously observed portfolio reallocations within  M3
came to a standstill. This meant that growth in money holdings was spread, as in the 
previous quarter, across all sub-components of  (see Table 2.3). That said, investor M3
interest centred around accumulating short-term time deposits and acquiring 
marketable financial instruments – in particular, money market fund shares – whilst 
overnight deposits were built up only moderately on balance.

Monetary policy and banking business
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 58Household M3 deposits accounted for the bulk of net inflows in terms of volume.  
Households continued to show fairly brisk demand for short-term time deposits, which 
were still offering attractive levels of remuneration compared with overnight deposits. 
In addition to households, financial corporations and general government (except 
central government) also increased their deposits in  Only non-financial corpora-.M3
tions reduced their  deposits on balance. One possible motivation for this is that M3
firms anticipating further policy rate cuts are looking to bide their time until borrowing 
costs also decline further.
Alongside short-term forms of investment, longer-term bank bonds were also an 
attractive purchase option for investors.  While the yields on longer-term bank bonds 
fell again in the third quarter of 2024, they were still higher than the remuneration on 
forms of investment within  Against this backdrop, non-banks once again showed .M3
relatively strong demand for longer-term bank debt securities. By contrast, investor 
interest in longer-term bank deposits, with their relatively low yields, was meagre, as it 
had been in the previous quarter.
On the counterpart side, strong inflows from abroad were the main factor driving 
monetary growth.  The recent uptick in the  sector’s net external assets largely MFI
came about due to the further increase in the euro area’s current account surplus with 
the rest of the world. Meanwhile, the most recent balance of payments statistics data 
suggest that net portfolio investment was almost balanced in the third quarter. Non-
resident investors continued to show a keen interest in euro area government bonds 
against the backdrop of lively net issuance activity within the bloc. Furthermore, the 
gradual reduction of the Eurosystem’s holdings of government bonds for monetary 
policy purposes made it possible for non-resident investors to add to their exposures in 
this segment. However, net purchases by non-resident investors took place alongside 
similarly strong net acquisitions of foreign securities by resident investors, largely 
neutralising the impact of these transactions on banks’ net external assets.
In addition, banks also added further to their loans and securitised lending to non-
banks, which likewise buoyed monetary growth. The upward tendency in lending to 
households became more entrenched. Lending to households gained significant 
traction during the summer months after exhibiting noticeable weakness in the previ-
ous quarters (see Chart 2.6). This upswing was fuelled by a distinct recovery in loans for 
house purchase. Demand for housing loans picked up in particular due to the moder-
ate decline in lending rates since the beginning of the year as well as robust household 
income growth. This observation is confirmed by data provided by the banks surveyed 
in the  according to which demand in this loan category increased markedly for the ,BLS

Monetary policy and banking business
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 59second time in succession. The  banks attributed this development primarily to the BLS
decline in the general level of interest rates. Moreover, the banks surveyed in the  BLS
reported that households had a more upbeat assessment of housing market prospects 
than before. Demand was expected to pick up further in the fourth quarter, according 
to the  banks.BLS
The banks surveyed in the BLS eased their credit standards for loans for house 
purchase for the third time in succession.  Standards were eased only marginally in 
the third quarter, however. Banks mainly attributed this easing to increased pressure 
from competition and their improved liquidity position.
Consumer credit also rose significantly on balance in the third quarter. Meanwhile, 
other lending to households was reduced further, but to a lesser extent. Looking at 
both loan categories together, the banks surveyed in the  reported a notable uptick BLS
in household demand for the second time in succession, as was the case with loans for 
house purchase. According to the  banks, this was due to increased consumer confi-BLS
dence and higher spending on durable consumer goods. At the same time, the 
surveyed banks further tightened their credit standards for consumer credit and other 
lending. They attributed this to their perception of increased credit risk and their 
reduced risk tolerance.


Monetary policy and banking business
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 60A noticeable recovery in loans to non-financial corporations is not yet evident. Banks 
expanded their loans to enterprises moderately on balance in the third quarter of 2024 
(see Chart 2.6). However, net inflows were weaker overall than in the previous quarter. 
Unlike in the previous quarter, short-term loans with maturities of up to one year were 
reduced on balance; volatility in this loan category has been strikingly high of late. Long-
term loans with maturities of over five years, which are usually more closely linked to 
firms’ investment activity, picked up again somewhat after a weaker previous quarter. 
The expansion fell short of the inflows in the winter half-year, however. Among the four 
major euro area Member States, banks in Germany, Italy and Spain continued to 
provide little impetus; only banks in France recorded significantly positive net lending.
So far, non-financial corporations have been able to finance much of their invest-
ment using internal funds. With lending rates still relatively high, the economic outlook 
uncertain and political uncertainty elevated, investment activity remained sluggish in 
the euro area, dragging on corporate demand for loans as well. On aggregate, the 
existing sources of internal funding were largely sufficient to finance the weak invest-
ment activity. Hence, in the Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises  most ( ), SAFE
firms reported that they did not apply for a bank loan because they had adequate inter-
nal funds at their disposal.  Consistent with this, non-financial corporations also did 
not make greater use of bonds as a source of funding on balance in the third quarter, 
even though bond yields had fallen more sharply than lending rates.
For the first time in two years, the BLS banks observed increased demand for loans 
amongst enterprises, following significant declines in some cases in the previous 
quarters.  The uptick was not strong, however, and lagged somewhat behind the expec-
tations that banks had reported in the previous quarter. According to the banks’ survey 
responses, expansionary impulses came from the decline in the general level of inter-
est rates and from the increased financing needs for debt refinancing, debt restructur-
ing and renegotiation. Furthermore, the banks observed an increase – albeit a small 
one – in financing needs for fixed investment for the first time in just over two years. 
The surveyed banks are expecting demand for loans to rise slightly in the fourth 
quarter of 2024 as well. 1) 
1 Strikingly, the  survey found that the share of enterprises that had not applied for a bank loan in the third SAFE
quarter of 2024 because they had adequate internal funds was lower in France than on average across the 
euro area. This is consistent with the relatively stable net lending to French enterprises.

Monetary policy and banking business
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 61BLS respondents did not adjust their credit standards for non-financial corporations 
on balance. The banks surveyed in the  reported that the general economic situa-BLS
tion and outlook had had a restrictive effect both in overall terms and from an industry-
specific and firm-specific perspective. This did not translate into a further tightening of 
credit standards, however. As a result, after around three years, the cycle of tightening 
credit standards for loans to enterprises has come to an end for now. That said, the BLS
banks are planning to tighten their credit standards yet again in the fourth quarter of 
2024. In addition, the rejection rate is up again on the previous quarter, though only 
marginally.

Monetary policy and banking business
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 623 German banks’ deposit and lending business with 
domestic customers
The German banking sector’s deposit business with domestic non-banks saw moder-
ate growth in the third quarter of 2024.  This was mainly because investors added 
further to their holdings of short-term time deposits. Interest rates on short-term time 
deposits declined in Germany and in the euro area as key interest rates were reduced. 
However, their remuneration remained attractive compared with other forms of 
deposit (see Chart 2.7).
Growth in deposit business was driven primarily by net inflows of household 
deposits.  Alongside households, financial and non-financial corporations contributed 
to deposit growth as well. Whilst enterprises mainly accumulated overnight deposits, 
households had a preference for short-term time deposits, which are somewhat less 
liquid, but offered higher yields. At the same time, they further reduced their holdings 
of short-term savings deposits, which offered comparatively unattractive yields. After 
households had significantly decreased their holdings of overnight deposits in the

lower opportunity costs of holding money.
German banks’ lending business with domestic customers grew noticeably in the 
third quarter of 2024.  For one thing, banks in Germany further expanded their lending 
to domestic general government, albeit to a somewhat lesser extent than in the previ-
ous quarter. An even more important factor driving lending business, though, was 
lending to the domestic private sector, much like in the euro area. Loans to financial 
corporations, in particular, rose again. In a departure from the previous quarter, 
however, loans to households also provided a slight boost in the third quarter of 2024 
(see Table 2.4).

The granting of loans to domestic households for house purchase remained at the 
level from the previous quarter. Unlike in the euro area, banks’ lending business with 
households in Germany has so far only shown a weak upward tendency. This is mainly 
because the granting of loans for house purchase in the third quarter once again fell 
short of the stronger first quarter (see Chart 2.8). Whilst interest rates on loans for 
house purchase fell slightly in Germany as well in the reporting quarter, they continue 
to be higher than in the other major euro area Member States. Moreover, according to 
the  banks in Germany once again made their credit standards in this category ,BLS Table 2.4: Banks in Germany: changes in lending and deposits

surveyed in the  attributed this to a deterioration in borrowers’ creditworthiness.BLS
New business volumes and BLS data, however, suggest that demand for loans for 
house purchase is picking up.  In contrast to the disbursements of loans that have 
already been approved, new business data have been indicating a slight increase in the 
volume of loans approved by banks since the beginning of the year. The banks 
surveyed in the  too, observed an increase in demand for loans for house purchase ,BLS
over the last three quarters. The surveyed banks attributed this to households’ more 
upbeat assessment of housing market prospects and to the lower general level of inter-
est rates (see Chart 2.9).


Monetary policy and banking business
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 66In addition to loans for house purchase, consumer credit also recorded slight 
growth.  Consistent with this, the  banks reported a rise in demand for consumer BLS
credit and other lending. In the view of the  banks, this was due primarily to an BLS
increase in both consumer confidence and spending on durable consumer goods in the 
third quarter of 2024. Nevertheless, the banks further tightened their credit standards 
for consumer credit and other lending because of their perception of a deterioration in 
households’ creditworthiness.
Lending business with the non-financial corporate sector saw only minimal growth.
The changes were small across all maturities (see Chart 2.8). There are no signs at 
present of an upward tendency in either loans with long maturities, which are usually 
used to finance investment, or in loans to enterprises overall. On the one hand, the 
current economic situation, alongside the persistently high financing costs, is continu-
ing to depress the propensity to invest and thus the demand for loans among German 
enterprises. On the other hand, business surveys like  indicate that demand for SAFE
loans was depressed, in particular, by firms having sufficient own funds in the report-
ing quarter.
According to the banks surveyed in the ,BLS  demand for loans amongst enterprises 
rose slightly for the second time in succession. This upswing was evident regardless 
of enterprise size. According to the  banks, the lower level of interest rates of late BLS


Monetary policy and banking business
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 67had a positive impact on loan demand for the first time in two years (see Chart 2.10). 
Furthermore, rising financing needs for debt restructuring and renegotiation and, 
among small and medium-sized enterprises, for fixed investment gave an additional 
boost to demand. Banks are expecting demand from corporate customers to increase 
further in the coming quarter.
Credit standards and terms and conditions for loans to enterprises were not tight-
ened further.  In the third quarter of 2024, the banks surveyed in the  did not BLS
tighten their credit standards any further for the first time in just under three years, but 
eased them marginally instead (see Chart 2.10). This marginal easing took place against 
the backdrop of a variety of influences, each of which played a minor role. While banks 
indicated that the general economic situation and the economic outlook were having a 
restrictive impact on loans to enterprises, this did not lead to credit standards being 
tightened in the third quarter. For the coming quarter, however, banks are planning to 
tighten their credit standards again.
The funding situation has improved somewhat for German banks.  Given the condi-
tions in financial markets, German banks reported that their funding situation had 
improved somewhat compared with the previous quarter.
The ECB Governing Council’s key interest rate decisions and the reduction in the 
Eurosystem’s monetary policy asset portfolio had a positive impact on bank

decisions have had, overall, a beneficial effect on banks’ profitability over the past six 
months. However, following the two interest rate cuts in June and September 2024, 
fewer banks reported a positive impact than in previous surveys. Banks continued to 
attribute the positive influence to an increase in net interest income. For the 2024‑25 
winter half-year, banks are expecting the key interest rate decisions to have a negative 
impact on their net interest income as well as on their profitability. The reduction in the 
Eurosystem’s monetary policy asset portfolio, taken in isolation, also had a positive 
impact on profitability, as it contributed to an increase in net interest income. German 
banks assessed the impact on their capital ratios, too, as positive.
The impact of the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO
III) on banks’ financial situation is now only very small.  Over the past six months,
 III had hardly any effect on the financial situation of banks in Germany. Only in TLTRO
terms of profitability did banks continue to report a positive impact. For the first time,
 III no longer had any effect on the liquidity position of banks in Germany. As TLTRO
the deadline for repaying borrowed funds in full is December 2024, banks are not 
expecting  III to have any further impact on their financial situation either over TLTRO
the next six months.

Financial markets
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 701 Financial market environment
The ongoing disinflation and political uncertainties shaped the development of 
financial markets. Against the background of further improvements in inflation data 
and weaker economic signals, market participants initially adjusted their policy rate 
expectations for the United States and the euro area significantly downwards. For a 
time, market participants considered a pronounced rate-cutting cycle and thus an early 
end to restrictive monetary policy likely. Subsequently, ten-year yields in the capital 
markets of major currency areas fell quite sharply. The beginning of the fourth quarter 
saw market participants’ medium term expectations of policy rate cuts being 
dampened by unexpectedly robust labour market and economic data as well as the 
prospect of potentially high  budget deficits. Term premia for longer-term  bonds US US
increased, too. This rise was also transmitted to interest rates in the euro area to a 
limited extent. At the end of the reporting period, the yields of ten-year government 
bonds presented a mixed picture compared with their end-June figures. However, the 
yield spread between the United States and the euro area increased. This contributed 
significantly to a depreciation of the euro against the  Dollar. In effective terms, the US
euro has also depreciated on balance against 18 trading partners.
Differing economic outlooks were clearly reflected in the international equity 
markets, with strong price gains in the United States and losses in the euro area 
and Japan. The nascent rate-cutting cycle and investors’ risk appetite, which has been 
growing again since mid-August, supported equity prices worldwide. In the United 
States, the asset prices of listed companies increased significantly. Market participants 
expect that the profits of listed companies, mainly those of financial corporations, will 
benefit from the new  administration’s policies. By contrast, lower earnings expecta-US
tions and the prospect of impending tariffs dampened equity price developments in the 
euro area. Amid growing risk appetite amongst investors, the yield spreads of long-
term government bonds in the euro area fell, as did those of corporate bonds, in partic-
ular.

Financial markets
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 712 Exchange rates
On balance, the euro has depreciated against the US dollar since the end of the 
second quarter of 2024.  Overall, developments in the euro-  dollar exchange rate US
since the end of June 2024 have mainly been influenced by expectations regarding  US
monetary policy and the outcome of the presidential elections in the United States. The 
Federal Reserve made it clear over the summer that it saw noticeable progress being 
made in combating inflation and thought the time had come to ease the degree of 
monetary policy restriction. The interest rate differential between the United States and 
the euro area declined during this period and the euro appreciated. At its meeting in 
mid-September, the Federal Reserve then cut key interest rates sharply by 50 basis 
points. The euro was trading at $1.12 at end-September, the highest level seen in US
over a year. However, surprisingly positive  labour market data subsequently US
pointed to the  economy remaining robust. Market participants therefore consid-US
ered a further 50 basis point cut by the Federal Reserve at one of its next meetings, 
which had been priced in for a time, to be fairly unlikely. This resulted in a downward 
movement of the euro that continued when the Eurosystem – contrary to expectations 
one month earlier – cut interest rates in mid-October in response to increasingly disap-
pointing economic data in the euro area. In addition, the sharp rise in  capital US
market interest rates, particularly in October, weighed on the euro. Market participants 
expected the budget deficit to rise strongly under the next US government. The 
prospect that the United States could impose additional tariffs on euro area products 
also put pressure on the euro, as a reduction in US imports due to tariffs would dimin-

2024.

Financial markets
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 72The euro has lost ground against the pound sterling since the end of the second 
quarter of 2024.  After the euro-pound sterling exchange rate had fluctuated only 
minimally in July, the single currency appreciated at the beginning of August following 
a policy rate cut by the Bank of England that surprised a number of market partici-
pants. Unlike the Eurosystem, however, the Bank of England left its monetary policy 
stance unchanged at its September meeting. The resulting increase in the short-term 
interest rate differential between the United Kingdom and the euro area led to small 
but steady losses for the euro. These came to a temporary halt when, at the end of 
October, the new  government announced higher levels of new borrowing for the UK
coming years.  Most recently, the euro stood at £0.83, down by 1.7 % since the end of 
June 2024.
The euro has depreciated against the yen on balance since the end of June 2024, 
amid sharp exchange rate movements.  The euro reached a record high of ¥175 on 
11 July, but, like other major currencies, then weakened rapidly against the yen up until 
the beginning of August. This shift was triggered by the Bank of Japan, which – in

confidence.

Financial markets
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 73contrast to other major central banks – increased the degree of monetary policy restric-
tion. The massive gains by the yen weighed on the profitability of currency carry trades, 
the unwinding of which further intensified the upward pressure on the yen. In addition, 
a number of indicators were published pointing to the surprisingly strong state of the 
Japanese economy. The euro reached just under ¥156 in mid-September, the weakest 
rate seen since the end of last year. It has since appreciated against the yen again, 
though, partly due to the fact that euro area monetary policy remained more restrictive 
than that of Japan. In addition, the long-standing governing party suffered surprising 
losses at the end of October in an election for the lower house of the Japanese parlia-
ment. The resulting political uncertainty drove the yen down further. Nevertheless, 
owing to the aforementioned sharp depreciation in July 2024, the euro has has been 
down 4.5 % overall since the beginning of the second half of the year, standing at ¥164 
most recently.
On a weighted average against the currencies of 18 trading partners, the euro has 
depreciated compared with end-June 2024.  The effective exchange rate of the euro 
against 18 trading partners has recorded losses on balance since the beginning of the 
second half of the year (-1.1 %). In addition to the euro’s depreciation against the  US
dollar, the pound sterling and the yen described above, the currency also lost ground 
against the Swiss franc (-2.8 %) and the renminbi (-1.9 %), amongst others. Nonetheless, 
price competitiveness in Germany and the euro area has deteriorated since last year. 
This marks a continuation of the deterioration from the previous year. Germany’s price 
competitiveness position is currently considered neutral based on the productivity 
approach. This follows the period from 2015 to 2023, where it could be regarded as 
having been favourable. Meanwhile, the price competitiveness of the euro area as a 
whole is still favourable, despite the recent deterioration.

3.1 Bond market
Government bond yields in the United States initially declined amid expectations of 
interest rate cuts, but recently rose significantly in view of uncertainty and the 
looming budget deficit ahead of the US presidential election.  Given the above-men-
tioned progress made in the disinflation process, the Federal Reserve initiated the inter-
est rate reversal and lowered its federal funds rate by 50 basis points in September and 
by 25 basis points in November. Yields on  Treasuries initially fell significantly as a US
result. Against the backdrop of the US presidential election, however, market partici-
pants also increasingly turned their attention to the higher US budget deficits expected 
under the new US government. When viewed in isolation, the associated burden on 
the capital market and the heightened uncertainty exerted upward pressure on long-
 In addition, term yields. rising market-based inflation expectations at the end of the

On balance, nominal yields on ten-year  Treasuries rose marginally by 4 basis points US
and stood at 4.5 % most recently.

Financial markets
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 76Amid falling key interest rate expectations and a weaker-than-anticipated economic 
outlook, government bond yields in the euro area declined. The Governing Council 
further loosened its monetary policy and lowered key interest rates at its September 
and October meetings by 25 basis points respectively. Market participants’ expectations 
as to the short and medium-term path of key interest rates in the euro area also dipped 
significantly. For example, calculated on the basis of money market rates, the expected 
deposit facility rate for the period up to mid-2025 most recently stood at 1.8 %, which is 
around 150 basis points lower than its current level. This reflected the market’s assess-
ment that the disinflation process is progressing apace in the euro area, too. According 
to survey findings, market participants deem monetary policy to be neither restrictive 
nor expansionary if key interest rates are roughly around the 2 % mark. In addition, 
some surprisingly weak economic indicators, especially in Germany, revealed the 
economic outlook in the euro area to have unexpectedly worsened. This, too, weighed

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 77on yields. Towards the end of the period under review, interest rate increases from the 
United States rubbed off somewhat on euro area yields. Overall, however, monetary 
policy impulses prevailed, such that the weighted yield on ten-year euro area - GDP
bonds fell by 29 basis points to 2.9 %.
Yields on ten-year Bunds fell less sharply than euro area bond yields on account of 
rising term premia.  Using term structure models, ten-year yield can be broken down 
into an expected monetary policy path and a term premium that investors charge for 
taking on interest rate risk. Over the course of the reporting period, the impact of 
falling key interest rates on long-term yields was dampened by unusually sharp 
increases in term premia. Premia are rising partly due to the  factors referred to US
above. As far as Bunds are concerned, however, another important factor has been the 
gradual phasing out of monetary policy asset purchase programmes, which has seen 
the free float of Bunds held by private investors increase and the scarcity of Bunds 
reduce.  This means that scarcity premia, which appear in the model decompositions

Financial markets
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 78mentioned above as climbing term premia, are priced out. Since the beginning of 
September, investors’ appetite for risk has also risen considerably again. Rising risk 
appetite means less demand for default-free Federal securities, which makes yields on 
them go up.
Euro area government bond spreads narrowed further as key interest rates fell and 
risk appetite increased . The weighted yield spreads of ten-year sovereign bonds - GDP
issued in the euro area over ten-year Bunds tightened by 17 basis points. One reason 
for this was the less restrictive monetary policy stance on both sides of the Atlantic, 
which had a positive impact on investors’ appetite for risk. The spread on ten-year 
French government bonds over Bunds exhibited a less significant decline due to persis-
tently high uncertainty surrounding French fiscal policy and the evolution of the public 
deficit.
Yields on UK government bonds rose amid persistent domestic price pressures and 
heightened uncertainty regarding the fiscal outlook, while Japanese bond yields 
remained unchanged despite the market turmoil of the summer. After holding inter-
est rates at the same level for a year, the Bank of England cut its policy rate by 25 basis 
points in August and again in November. As in the United States and the euro area, the 
medium-term policy rate expectations of market participants in the United Kingdom 
nudged up again in September. The presentation of plans envisaging high budget 
deficits in the United Kingdom going forward has recently led to additional upward 
pressure on yields on ten-year  gilts, which rose by a total of 31 basis points to 4.5 %. UK
In Japan, by contrast, yields on ten-year government bonds remained unchanged at 
1.1 %. The Bank of Japan tightened its monetary policy in July, which came as a surprise. 
In August, Japanese yields fell in the wake of a bout of market turmoil, as the Bank of 
Japan tamped down expectations of further monetary policy tightening.

Financial markets
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 79Market-based inflation indicators declined slightly over the period under review. For 
2025, market-based inflation expectations calculated on the basis of euro area inflation 
swaps stood around 2.0 % at last count, placing them in line with the price stability 
objective. Across most of the reporting period, the assessment of euro area  infla- HICP
tion for 2025 was shaped by falling oil prices. The fall in oil prices saw market-based 
inflation indicators in annual terms move in the same direction on account of a base 
effect. In addition, the weaker-than-expected sentiment indicators for economic devel-
opments drove market participants to factor in higher downside risks with regard to 
the short and medium-term inflation outlook when making investment decisions. Most 
recently market and survey data have shown significant convergence to the Eurosystem’
s projections, with market participants having been taken by surprise by the high infla-
tion figures in October. The option-implied probability of average euro area inflation 
lying between 1.5 % and 2.5 % over the next five years stood at just under 50 % at last 
reckoning, the highest it has been since the outbreak of Russia’s war of aggression 
against Ukraine in early 2022. Overall, this is further indication that market participants 
assume that euro area inflation will now swiftly return to the Eurosystem’s target.
The increased confidence in the prospect of a sustained return to target-level infla-
tion was also reflected in long-term surveys and market prices.  For example, the five-
year forward inflation rate five years ahead was in line with the target at 2.1 %, 0.2 


Financial markets
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 80percentage point below its mid-year level. Longer-term survey-based inflation expecta-
tions calculated on a quarterly basis by Consensus Economics for the euro area also 
remained at the 2 % target mark in October.
Yields on European corporate bonds fell as market participants’ appetite for risk 
grew.  Yields on BBB-rated corporate bonds with residual maturities of between seven 
and ten years declined significantly, for both financial and non-financial corporations. 
With yields on matched-maturity Federal securities falling less sharply, yield spreads 
narrowed. Yield spreads on high-yield bonds also recorded comparably strong declines, 
a development which also manifested in lower credit default premia for all relevant 
bond classes. Overall, the financing costs of European firms, as measured by yield 
spreads, were recently below their respective five-year averages irrespective of their 
credit quality ratings.
3.2 Equity market
Following a major price correction at the beginning of August, international equity 
indices rebounded significantly and managed to recoup some of the losses that had 
been incurred.  The  500 index has gone up a further 8.9 % since the end of June, USS&P
reaching a new peak. By contrast, the EURO STOXX hardly changed. Equity prices in the 
United States were bolstered primarily by the improved economic outlook and a 
positive start to the reporting season, which was also reflected in higher earnings 
expectations for  firms.  equities rose again significantly on the heels of the  US US US
elections. This was partly due to the fact that – as often happens after  presidential US
elections – uncertainty about the future policy stance of the United States abated. Taken 
in isolation, this acted as a boost to prices. The fact market participants were expecting 
profits of listed companies – especially financial corporations – to increase under the new
 administration also played a role. The new  government plans to deregulate, US US
raise tariffs and cut taxes. In the euro area, by contrast, earnings expectations fell in 
the period under review. Along with weaker economic activity, expectations of higher 
tariffs worldwide clouded the outlook. Conversely, lower interest rates and a greater 
risk appetite on the part of investors served to buoy up price developments when 
considered by themselves. Although the  hit new record highs during the period CDAX
under review (4.8 %), returns on German non-financial stock corporations are lower 
than European and  peers, even from a longer-term perspective (see theUS supplemen-
).  equities in the  100 index were down, by 1.1 %. Japanese tary information UK FTSE
equities clearly rallied in the summer after experiencing the sharpest stock market

on balance (see the section on ). exchange rates
Equities issued by banks in Europe and the United States have continued to signifi-
cantly outperform the equity market as a whole.  Since the end of June, these bank 
equities have recorded significant price gains. The prospect of higher interest margins 
owing to expectations of interest rate cuts receding somewhat of late, is likely to have 
contributed to the gains posted by bank equities. In the wake of the  presidential US
elections,  bank shares, in particular, were trading markedly higher again, boosted US
by expectations on the part of market participants that the new  administration US
could roll back at least some of the regulatory measures imposed on the financial indus-
try following the financial crisis of 2008. Overall, the prices of European and  bank US
equities rose by a respective 5.9 % and 20.2 % on balance.
US equity valuations remain persistently high. Measured in terms of the earnings 
yield over the next 12 months, European and  equity valuations have risen. In the US
case of the EURO STOXX, the implied cost of equity – a metric which uses a dividend 
discount model to take account of the medium-term earnings expectations as 
well – was down, with both lower interest rates and a lower equity risk premium playing 
a part. This suggests that European equity valuations have gone up, though they 
remain moderate by long-term standards. The implied cost of equity for  equities US
barely changed, signalling that valuations persist at a historically high level.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 82Supplementary information
The equity market performance of German firms in a 
longer-term international comparison
Measured in terms of price and dividend developments, the performance of German 
non-financial equities has fallen distinctly short of the United States and other 
European countries since 2018. This stands in contrast to the period prior to 2018, 
when the total return on German equities evolved on a par with the US market and 
significantly outstripped other European firms (see Chart 3.6).  One reason for the 
weaker performance observed in recent years is likely to have been the rise in energy 
prices following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, which had a particular 
impact on energy-intensive German firms. However, it appears that investors had been 
pricing German firms lower than their international competitors even before that. For 
example, in the period from the beginning of 2018 to the end of 2021 , shareholder
– meaning price appreciation plus any dividends paid – on returns  domestic non-finan-
cial corporations were 16 percentage points beneath those on European equities and a 
considerable 67 percentage points below US firms. 1)

Financial markets
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 83From an investor perspective, the picture this paints of the market is indicative of 
an already long-standing weakness on the part of German listed companies. The 
more anaemic performance of domestic equities was not confined purely to certain 
sectors, such as energy-intensive industries or basic materials (including chemicals). 
Increased competitive pressure from China has seen global market shares of German 
exports contracting in recent years, especially in the case of the automotive and 
mechanical engineering sectors (see the competitive supplementary information on
pressure from China  in the “Global and European setting” article ). All in all, these devel-
opments are also reflected in the indicator of price competitiveness, with Germany’s 
(see having deteriorated on balance compared with 2018 Chart  3.2).

86The German economy

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 871 Slight rise in German economic output in the third 
quarter.
The rise in German economic output in the third quarter of 2024 came as a surprise. 
The outlook remains poor, however.  According to the flash estimate of the Federal 
Statistical Office, seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product  rose by 0.2 % ( ) GDP
on the previous quarter.  This exceeded earlier expectations,  but the decline in  GDP
in the second quarter was revised from 0.1 % to 0.3 % at the same time. Economic 
output thus remained weak overall in the summer half-year. Moreover, it is difficult to 
derive an improvement to the underlying cyclical trend from the  increase in the GDP
third quarter. According to the Federal Statistical Office, this was mainly driven by rising 
government and private consumption expenditure  and given the mixed picture of 
indicators for private consumption, it is likely that this rose only slightly. Thus, at the 
current time, none of the key demand components give any cause to expect a marked 
short-term recovery in the German economy. Private consumption benefited from the 
steep rise in wages in the third quarter but the labour market is becoming increasingly 
gloomy and the high level of consumer uncertainty – which is probably partly a result of 
this – is likely to have dampened its growth. Exports, as well as output in the industrial 
sector and in construction, continued to decline. The still elevated financing costs and 
pronounced economic policy uncertainty continued to weigh on investment and thus 
on demand for construction and capital goods. In addition, the now low capacity utilisa-
tion makes investment in the industrial sector more difficult. In view of German indus-
try’s deteriorating competitive position, no growth impetus came from the expanding 
German sales markets abroad. The industrial sector is under high pressure to adapt to 
changing structural conditions at domestic production sites and in global markets. 1)   2)

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 892 Industrial and construction activity remained weak
Industrial output and exports of goods continued to decline.  After seasonal adjust-
ment, industrial output fell strongly in September. Taking the average of the third 
quarter, it contracted significantly compared with the previous quarter, with the decline 
affecting most sectors. Production in energy-intensive sectors was down as well, follow-
ing two quarters of rising output. The ongoing weakness in demand for German indus-
trial products is likely to have been the key cause in the overall decline in industrial 
output. According to surveys conducted by the  Institute, the already severe lack of ifo
orders continued to worsen. Only a few sectors experienced an increase in output. 
Other vehicle construction and the repair and installation of machinery continued on 
an upward trajectory, for example. The manufacture of motor vehicles edged up 
slightly as well. In line with weak industrial activity overall, exports of goods also 
decreased again in the third quarter. The fact that German industry profited so little 
from the quite strong growth in global trade in the summer half-year is likely to be 
mainly due to the fact that its competitive position outside and within the  has deteri-EU
orated considerably in recent years.  The industrial sector is faced with a difficult 
environment and is under high pressure to adapt to changing structural conditions at 
domestic production sites and on global markets. It needs to adjust to the longer-term 
impact of the energy price shock triggered by the Russian war of aggression against 
Ukraine, as well as cope with numerous other challenges, such as the green transition 
to carbon-neutral production methods, demographic change or increasing competition 
from emerging economies such as China. The German automotive industry is particu-
larly affected by this structural change (see the supplementary information “Recent 
developments in Germany’s automotive industry”). 4)

Recent developments in Germany’s automotive industry
Germany’s automotive sector is currently undergoing a process of profound trans-
formation.  Changes in international competition, in particular rising competitive 
pressure from China, and the transition to e-mobility pose major challenges to the 
German automotive industry. Given the considerable importance the automotive indus-
try has for value added and employment in Germany, this transformation process is 
also of consequence for the economy as a whole.
So far, the burdens resulting from the transformation have outweighed the 
positives.  Production of motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts in Germany peaked in 
2017 and has declined considerably since then. Averaged across 2023, it was 15 % lower 
than in 2017 in calendar-adjusted terms.  According to information provided by the 
German Association of the Automotive Industry  the number of passenger cars ( ), VDA
produced in Germany fell by more than a quarter between 2017 and 2023. The number 
of domestically produced passenger cars with an internal combustion engine declined 
particularly sharply during this period, by almost half. Exports of combustion engine 
vehicles fell by roughly two-fifths during this period. At the same time, the number of 
battery-powered passenger cars produced increased sevenfold, and their share of total 
passenger car production in Germany shot up to almost one-third.  Exports of electric 
cars rose 8½-fold to just over one quarter. However, this was far from enough to offset 
the decline in combustion engine vehicles. Despite lower production figures, automo-
tive manufacturers in Germany recorded significant sales growth. This suggests that 
they sold more high-priced vehicles and were able to push through price increases for  1)

1 Manufacturers of motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts generated slightly less than 4 % of German  in GDP
2022 (the latest point for which data are available). Their share of goods exports was just over 17 % in 2023. In 
addition, in the same year, 907,000 persons were directly employed in automotive industry jobs subject to 
social security contributions. This represented 2.6 % of all employees subject to social security contributions. 
The automotive industry plays an even greater role for the economy as a whole through supply relationships 
with other sectors (see Puls and Fritsch (2020)).
2 Industrial output excluding motor vehicles declined somewhat less sharply. In 2023, it was 7 % below the 
annual average for 2017.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 91their vehicles in the market amid supply bottlenecks in 2021‑22. In addition, enterprises 
generated more sales from activities that cannot be classified as production operations. 
In line with these developments, national accounts data show that gross value added in 
the automotive sector rose sharply in 2022 (most recent available data) and was thus 
higher than in 2017.
Signs of weakness are currently prevalent in the automotive sector.  In the second 
and third quarters of 2024, seasonally adjusted output rose again quarter on quarter, 
after declining for four consecutive quarters. However, at last count, it remained below 
the previous year’s level. New orders rose two quarters in a row, albeit from a low level. 
Enterprises in the automotive sector have also recently had to contend with a poor 
orders situation. According to the  Institute, the share of enterprises reporting a ifo
shortage of orders in October stood at 44 %, which actually represented a further 
increase.
The sluggish development of the global automotive market has contributed to the 
weakness in German motor vehicle production in recent years.  The German passen-
 4) 
4 As a result, the discrepancy between gross value added and the production index is particularly pronounced in 
the automotive sector. The increasing divergence observed since the pandemic could be related to the 
methods of statistical data collection. For example, the national accounts capture a greater part of automotive 
companies’ economic activity in that they include services.

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 92ger car industry is heavily dependent on exports and therefore on the global automo-
tive market. Around three-quarters of passenger cars produced in Germany are 
destined to go abroad.  Global passenger car sales expanded extremely rapidly up 
until 2017, but then cooled off and fell sharply during the pandemic. This led to a slump 
in production in Germany, too.  After that, the global market recovered; nonetheless, 
the number of new passenger car registrations worldwide remained around 10 % 
below 2017 levels in 2023. This decline is broadly based across regions and can be 
observed in North America, Europe, China and Japan, amongst others.
In addition, German manufacturers have recently fallen behind in the important 
Chinese market. In China, one in two cars sold is already an electric vehicle. Chinese 
suppliers dominate this segment, while German manufacturers have so far only 
achieved very low market shares. Against this backdrop, German manufacturers are 
facing a significant decline in sales in China. This impairs not only production in China 
itself, but also German motor vehicle exports to China, which have declined noticeably 
since 2023. In addition, direct investment by the German automotive sector in China is 
generating significantly fewer profits.  In the past, these investments had contributed 
considerably to German automobile groups’ profits.
In recent years, China has become a significant competitor for Germany in third-
country automotive markets. Since 2017, Germany has lost market shares in many 
important customer countries for motor vehicle products.  The rising competitive 
pressure from China was probably a contributory factor (see the supplementary infor-
mation on mounting competitive pressure from China on Germany and other advanced 
economies in the article “Global and European setting” in this Monthly Report). China 
has advanced to become the most important exporter of passenger cars in recent  5)

6 This slump in production was partly caused by car dealerships in Germany having to close temporarily and 
supply chains being disrupted by temporary border closures in 2020 as a result of the measures taken to 
contain the pandemic.
7 From as long ago as 2012, China was the most important foreign production location for German automobile 
manufacturers. As a result, they benefited from the rapid growth in demand in the Chinese automotive 
market. At the end of 2022, around one-third of the total stock of German direct investment in the automotive 
sector was invested in China.
8 The decline was particularly large in the United Kingdom, where Germany’s share shrank from 37 % to 25 %. 
The country’s withdrawal from the  in particular, is likely to have been a key factor in this. Market share gains ,EU
in China can probably be attributed in part to China lowering tariffs on imported cars and car parts in mid-
2018, which could have benefited German manufacturers in particular.

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 93years. Chinese electric cars have made their way into Europe, in particular.  In 
response to competition-distorting subsidies in China, the European Commission 
recently imposed compensatory tariffs on imports of electric cars from China.
In addition, the problems being faced by Germany as an industrial location as well 
as sector-specific developments are weighing on manufacturers of motor vehicles 
and motor vehicle parts in Germany. The shortage of skilled labour, high wage and 
energy costs as well as excessive red tape are also impairing the automotive industry’s 
competitiveness.

9 The share of vehicles produced in China in total registrations of fully electric cars in the  could rise to one-EU
quarter this year. Up until now, European-Chinese joint ventures and Tesla accounted for much of this. The 
market share of purely Chinese brands could reach 11 % this year and rise to 20 % in the medium term; see 
Transport & Environment (2024).
10 The additional tariffs are staggered by producer and designed to compensate for the Chinese subsidies; the 
objective is for them to restore “fair” competitive conditions without generally restricting access to the 
European market. They therefore conform with  law. China has announced that it will impose additional WTO
tariffs on imports of high-performance internal combustion cars as a possible countermeasure. This could 
affect Germany in particular.
11 According to the Bundesbank Online Panel – Firms (BOP-F), the shortage of skilled labour, high energy and 
labour costs, uncertainty about the regulatory framework as well as the burden of taxes and levies stand in 
the way of firms investing more in Germany. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2024b). In addition, the survey shows 
that firms consider the high burden of regulation to be one of the most pressing problems.

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 94The transition to electric propulsion is, moreover, proving difficult for German 
manufacturers and suppliers, who have considerable expertise in combustion 
technology.  New registrations of electric cars in Germany fell sharply in 2023, and a 
large decline also looks likely in 2024. New registrations of vehicles with internal 
combustion engines rose significantly. By contrast, new registrations of electric cars 
continued to rise this year in several other major European countries including the 
United Kingdom, France and Spain.  The problems with electric vehicle sales there-
fore currently appear to be particularly pronounced in Germany.
The transition to e-mobility requires adjustments on the part of the automotive 
industry in Germany.  However, German car manufacturers have weathered other 
challenges in the past, some of them major. A study finds that they are basically well 
equipped to successfully accomplish the transition both in terms of the proportion of 
employees with the skills required for the transition and the number of green patents.
 One of the prerequisites is a sufficiently developed charging infrastructure, an area 
where further progress will have to be made.  In addition, a clear economic policy 
framework is needed that leaves no doubt as to the political backing for the transition. 12)

Network Agency’s register of charging stations suggest that the elevated pace of expansion achieved in 2023 
would need to be maintained to achieve this minimum figure by 2030.

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 95Commercial investment in machinery and equipment is likely to have fallen in the 
third quarter.  This is indicated by the domestic sales of capital goods producers, which 
in price-adjusted terms declined significantly compared with the previous quarter. Price-
adjusted capital goods imports (available up to August) also point in this direction. 
Elevated financing costs and heightened economic policy uncertainty continued to 
weigh on investment. The fact that industrial utilisation rates have been low for some 
time now is also likely to have contributed to the weak investment activity. According to 
surveys conducted by the  Institute, capacity utilisation has been declining since ifo
October 2022 and is now quite significantly down on its long-term average. This is a 
clear reflection of the persistent lack of demand.
Construction investment and construction output continued to suffer from weak 
demand.  Construction investment is likely to have continued to decline in the third 
quarter. Seasonally adjusted construction output fell again compared with the previous 
quarter. Output in building construction contracted particularly sharply, but it was 
down in the finishing trades and civil engineering sectors, too. Nominal construction 
sales up to August indicate that housing investment, in particular, decreased further. 
By contrast, taking the average of July and August, sales in industrial and public 
construction and in road construction were up on the previous quarter. The construc-
tion sector continues to struggle with weak demand for construction work. Averaged 
over July and August, new orders in the main construction sector rose significantly 
compared with the previous quarter. Compared with levels seen during the phase of 
low interest rates (roughly the fourth quarter of 2021), they were still very muted, 
however. This was due to building construction, where demand has also recently 
declined in quarter-on-quarter terms. By contrast, new orders in civil engineering were 
again above the level of the end of 2021. In housing construction, in particular, the still 
elevated financing costs continue to have a negative impact.

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 96Private consumption and probably also service providers bolstered the economy in 
the third quarter.  The steep rise in wages contributed positively to consumption. 
However, it is likely that consumers have been reluctant to make use of their additional 
spending leeway. This appears reasonable in the light of the now noticeable cooling in 
the labour market and is supported by mixed signals from the indicators for private 
consumption. The  consumer climate improved, albeit from a low level. The number GfK
of new passenger car registrations went down according to the German Association of 
the Automotive Industry  Price-adjusted sales in the hotel and restaurant sector, ( ). VDA
which averaged across July and August were lower than in the previous quarter, are 
another indicator of weak consumption. By contrast, real retail sales showed a positive 
development. In the third quarter, they were clearly up on the previous quarter. Private 
consumption is thus likely to have provided only little impetus to the services sector as 
a whole. Weak industrial activity also impacted the services sector. Price-adjusted 
wholesale sales dropped significantly compared with the previous quarter. The produc-
tion index which, taking the average of July and August, was slightly higher than in the 
previous quarter, provided a positive signal for the services sector. Service providers 
are therefore likely to have supported economic activity overall.


The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 973 Labour market cooled in the third quarter
The protracted economic weakness also reached the hitherto very robust labour 
market in the third quarter. Employment declined slightly from its previous record 
highs. Strong sectoral differentiation continued. The number of jobs in manufacturing 
and trade fell. By contrast, labour demand for services remained high, although in 
some segments employment was likewise increasing at a slower pace than previously. 
Unemployment continued to climb. While short-time work has increasingly been made 
use of in manufacturing for some time now, it still plays no major role in the overall 
economy. The outlook remains muted. According to leading indicators, there will be 
neither a significant improvement or a major deterioration in the labour market situa-
tion in the coming months.
Germany’s working population declined on the quarter.  On an average of the 
summer months, the seasonally adjusted number of employed persons was down by 
45,000 compared with the second quarter of 2024. Total employment was thus down 
by 0.1 %. With the publication of total employment data on 30 October 2024, the 
months since the beginning of 2024 have also been revised by the Federal Statistical 
Office. In particular from June 2024 onwards, employment has been revised 
downwards, which means that employment dynamics have now turned slightly 
negative and the level of employment is just over 0.1 % or 70,000 persons lower.  This 
means that the labour market is somewhat weaker than before. According to data avail-
able up to August, the number of people in exclusively low-paid part-time work fell 
markedly. The declining trend in self-employment has continued for some time now. By 
contrast, the number of jobs subject to social security contributions was relatively 
stable.
Staff cutbacks are confined to certain sectors, albeit important ones.  In the manufac-
turing sector, which is particularly exposed to international competition and structural 
change, firms have already been moderately reducing jobs subject to social security  5) 
5 This is primarily due to a fall in the number of employees. However, the figures published by the Federal 
Employment Agency  on jobs subject to social security contributions or low-paid jobs based on register data ()BA
are not affected by the revision.

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 98contributions for some time now. This decline accelerated somewhat. So far, staff levels 
are likely to have been reduced mainly through normal fluctuation, by replacing fewer 
employees. The adjustment in temporary employment, where many employees were 
employed in the manufacturing sector, was significantly stronger. Core staff could thus 
often be retained in spite of declining industrial output. However, the options to use 
temporary employment will be fewer and fewer in future, as this adjustment channel 
has already been deployed very frequently. Staffing levels in construction and trade 
were likewise down moderately. The maximum level of employment now appears to 
have been reached in the hotel and restaurant services after the pandemic, with the 
headcount down somewhat recently. There was hardly any expansion in the previously 
strongly growing information and communication sector and business services. By 
contrast, quite vigorous hiring activity was still being seen in the health and long-term 
care sector, education, the public sector, energy and water supply and the financial 
sector. Labour demand in these areas is benefiting significantly in some cases from 
demographic change and decarbonisation.
Still only moderate uptake of short-time work for economic reasons.  This instrument 
is primarily used to bridge temporary cyclical falls in demand. However, many firms are 
complaining of structural difficulties. Furthermore, the relatively restrained use is likely 


The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 99due to the fact that access criteria have not been eased, as was the case during the 
pandemic or the 2008‑09 economic and financial crisis. In addition, the enterprises 
registering are required to cover the costs of short-time workers’ social security contri-
butions for the hours not worked. Only the manufacturing sector saw a slightly higher 
uptake, with 2.5 % of all employees subject to social security contributions affected in 
July. Short-time work was virtually non-existent in the rest of the economy.
Immigration from other EU countries is increasingly stabilising employment subject 
to social security contributions, which has risen until recently.  As the labour supply 
in the domestic population and thus also the number of employees with German 
nationality is falling for demographic reasons – in August 2024, there were 160,000 
fewer employees subject to social security contributions than in the previous 
month – more and more immigrants are filling this gap. Net immigration from other  EU
member states has now also come to a standstill this year. This type of labour market-
oriented immigration – often from the east-central European acceding 
countries – played a prominent role in employment growth in Germany in the 2010s. 
Compared with the previous year, however, its contribution to growth in employment 
subject to social security contributions has now fallen to zero. In the current subdued 
labour market conditions, it is thus mainly immigrants from third countries compensat-
ing for the significant decline in the domestic labour force. Here the number of employ-
ees subject to social security contributions was up by 284,000 compared with the same 
month of the previous year.  In addition to the simplifications for labour market-ori-
ented immigration that have been in force for several months under the Skilled 
Immigration Act ( ) – no data on their impact are available Fachkräfteeinwanderungsgesetz
yet – it is also worth mentioning the extent to which refugees already resident in the 
country are being integrated into the workforce. In the case of Ukrainian refugees, in 
particular, the previously very low transition rate from unemployment to employment 
has improved significantly since the beginning of the year.  Nonetheless, monthly 
transitions of 6 % of unemployed asylum seekers and just under 4 % of unemployed 
Ukrainians to the primary labour market show that the pace of integration is still slow. 6) 
 7) 
6 This increase was mainly driven by persons from Ukraine (+65,000), from the most important countries of 
asylum origin (Syria, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, Eritrea, Somalia) where there was a rise of 
59,000, and the Western Balkans (Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Kosovo, 
Albania) where the number went up by 32,000. The remainder is widely dispersed, with labour market-ori-
ented immigration coming largely from India, South-East Asia and Latin America.
7 Language and integration courses and the waiting time for them are likely to have caused delays in Ukrainian 
refugees finding a job. At the same time, conditions for finding a job are not easy at the current time either, 
owing to the high proportion of single mothers and childcare facilities being scarce.

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 100Registered unemployment saw a further slight uptick.  In the third quarter, an 
average of 2.81 million persons were unemployed when viewed on a seasonally 
adjusted basis, or around 52,000 persons more than in the second quarter of 2024. This 
pushed up the unemployment rate by 0.1 percentage point to 6.0 %. In October, the 
ranks of the unemployed were swelled by a further 27,000 people compared to the 
previous month, taking the unemployment rate to 6.1 %. In recent months, there has 
been a particular increase in the number of unemployed persons covered by the statu-
tory unemployment insurance scheme, which is subject to cyclical influences.
Employment could see a further moderate decrease over the next few months.  In 
particular, the  Institute’s employment barometer dipped further into negative terri-ifo
tory in recent months; this barometer is based on surveys of businesses’ personnel 
plans. At the same time, these surveys reveal the high degree of heterogeneity across 
sectors. Sentiment is especially low in the manufacturing and trade sectors. The  ifo
Institute’s surveys provide less coverage of sectors rendering basic public services, 
which have seen the largest growth in their staff levels up to the current end. The 
employment component of the ’s labour market barometer for the economy as a IAB
whole thus paints a more positive picture, as it implicitly includes these areas. The 
number of vacancies reported to the Federal Employment Agency recently stabilised 
after a long decline. Unemployment is likely to continue rising slowly. The unemploy-

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 1024 Wages currently still rising strongly
Negotiated wages saw a very strong increase in the third quarter.  Including ancillary 
agreements, they went up by a substantial 8.8 % on the year in the third quarter, 
compared with 3.1 % in the previous quarter. This is the highest year-on-year growth 
rate since the summer of 1993. It was mainly driven by very steep negotiated wage 
adjustments in the retail sector as well as in wholesale and foreign trade. These sectors 
negotiated high permanent wage increases, back payments and an inflation compensa-
tion bonus. Even disregarding these special payments and looking exclusively at basic 
remuneration levels, negotiated wages went up by 5.6 % year on year in the third 
quarter, once again outpacing the second-quarter increase of 4.3 %. The phase of very 
high wage increases may have peaked in the third quarter, however.
Actual earnings also look to have increased substantially.  This is indicated by the 
gross monthly earnings obtained from the Federal Statistical Office’s earnings survey, 
with published data available up to and including September 2024.  These earnings 
actually grew slightly more strongly still than in the second quarter, when actual 
earnings had gone up by more than 5 %, an increase which remained well above 
average in the long term.
Wages rose more sharply in services than in manufacturing.  This likely also reflects 
the ongoing shortage of skilled workers in the services sectors.  Services workers have 
now largely recovered the losses in real wages that they suffered as a result of surging 
inflation. In the manufacturing sector, however, real wage losses since 2021 have not 
been fully made up.
High wage demands are currently coinciding with a weak economic setting. The 
trade unions’ current wage demands range from 7 % (rubber and plastics industry) to 
19 % (system catering) for a term of 12 months. They are relatively high because, now 
that inflation compensation bonus payments have ceased, the trade unions are seeking 
to offset the losses in purchasing power that have occurred in recent years by securing  8)

sector, for example, the trade union ver.di is demanding a permanent wage increase of 
8 %, or at least €350, for a term of 12 months.  However, the recently agreed wage 
increase in the metals and electrical engineering industry was fairly moderate, at 2.2 % 
per annum, given the strong deterioration in that sector’s economic situation. The 
agreement in this key industrial sector could act as a signal for other industrial sectors. 
Overall, given the prolonged period of economic weakness and significantly lower infla-
tion rates, the other forthcoming wage negotiations are expected to result in distinctly 
lower agreements than in the past two years.

around half as much as in the previous two quarters. Energy prices actually saw a 
marked drop. This was primarily true of refined petroleum products, which reflected 
the lower oil prices but also the appreciation of the euro and probably dampened profit 
margins. In the case of gas and electricity tariffs, previous declines in the relevant 
market prices were likely also passed on to consumers. Services price inflation came 
down a little, yet remained unusually high. Food price inflation even intensified again. 
There was a significant increase in the cost of dairy products as well as fruit and vegeta-
bles, in particular. For non-energy industrial goods, the slight price decline recorded in 
the previous quarter did not continue, but the price rise was no more than moderate 
and not nearly as strong as in the previous year. Year-on-year upward price pressures 
also subsided. The headline inflation rate dropped from 2.6 % to 2.2 %.  This was due 
not only to the declining energy prices in the third quarter of 2024, but also to a 
dampening base effect caused by the rise in energy prices in the third quarter of 2023. 
By contrast, the core rate excluding energy and food (3.1 %) remained almost as high as 
in the previous quarter (3.2 %).
Inflation was significantly higher again in October, which was not solely due to a 
base effect for energy . In October, consumer prices increased significantly in season-
ally adjusted terms. Energy prices went up again as crude oil prices were higher. Food 
prices also rose more sharply again given another significant hike in the prices of dairy 
products as well as fruit and vegetables. Travel services were much more expensive 
than in the previous month, which was reflected in the prices of services as a whole. 
However, even excluding volatile travel prices, inflation in services remained above 
average. Rents continued to rise somewhat more strongly than the historical average. 11)

 This was partly because energy prices came down markedly in October 2023, which 
was reflected as a base effect in inflation in October 2024, driving up the rate. The core

Inflation in Germany has cooled significantly since its peak in October 2022, when 
the annual rate of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices ( ) HICP  had reached 
11.6 %.  The disinflation process was driven by the volatile components of energy and 
food. Core components also contributed to the decline in inflation after a certain time 
lag. Price pressures for non-energy industrial goods, in particular, decreased sharply 
due to subsiding supply-side disruptions. By contrast, growth in prices for services 
continues to be very high, mainly owing to the persistently steep wage growth.
Core components also include services related to housing. So far, these have had 
little impact on the disinflation process in Germany. The upward momentum in rents, 
which make up by far the largest share of services relating to housing, grew steadily up 
to the second quarter of 2024. Rents rose by 2.1 % year on year in the third quarter of 
2024, while they had increased by 1.9 % at the height of inflation in the fourth quarter 
of 2022. Alongside persistently high demand, rent developments also reflect the 
unfavourable supply developments in the housing market since 2021, which have 
tended to drive prices up.  This affects not only the supply of rented accommodation, 
but also the construction of owner-occupied housing in particular. In addition, 
extremely high prices for construction work and the adjusted mortgage rates in the 
wake of the monetary policy tightening, combined with the high level of purchase 
prices reached at the end of the housing market boom, made it considerably more diffi-
cult to purchase housing for own use.
The costs of owner-occupied housing ( ) OOH  remain excluded from the coverage of

review, the  Governing Council recommended integrating  costs into the  ECB OOH HICP 1)

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 107in order to improve its representativeness and cross-country comparability,  with the 
net acquisition approach as the preferred method of measurement. At the same time, 
the Governing Council announced that price indicators which take  costs into OOH
account will be included in the regularly monitored dataset for assessing price develop-
ments.
OOH  price indices based on official statistics allow, within limits, the net acquisition 
approach to be used to augment the HICP  to include OOH  costs.  Results are only 
available quarterly and with a publication lag of around one quarter. To understand the 
development of the  price index, it is important to look at its composition. In OOH
Germany, almost three-quarters of the index consists of prices for self-builds and major 
renovations; around one-sixth consists of purchase prices for newly built houses, includ-
ing the ancillary costs of purchase; and around one-tenth consists of expenditure relat-
ing to existing owner-occupied dwellings. The marked upturn and downturn in 
house and construction prices is thus also reflected in the  price index. For OOH
instance, its annual rate shot up to 15.2 % by mid-2022 and then declined again fairly 
quickly; in the second quarter of 2024, the year-on-year increase was just 2.1 %. 4)

5 In the  price indices of other euro area countries, construction prices play a lesser role and real estate OOH
prices play a greater role. In the  price index for the euro area, for example, self-builds and major renova- OOH
tions account for 45 % and the purchase prices of newly built real estate, including the costs of services related 
to acquisition, account for 32 % (see Eiglsperger et al. (2024), p. 8).

contributed noticeably to the disinflation process. What also has to be borne in mind 
with this finding is the fact that the annual  rate with the addition of the  HICP OOH

2022. As a result,  costs provided an additional inflation impulse up to 2022, OOH

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 109On a long-term average, experimental calculations show that the inflation rate in 
Germany is not markedly affected by whether OOH  costs are included in the HICP  or 
not. Over the past 25 years, with the exception of 2021‑22, the annual  rate includ- HICP

quality.  The associated statistical and methodological challenges were taken into 
account.  Nevertheless, in response to the Governing Council’s wish to use the net

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 112Inflation is expected to be somewhat higher still for a time.  Energy prices fell signifi-
cantly at the end of 2023. Viewed in isolation, this downward movement in the base 
year will push up inflation in the coming months, as the gap between current prices 
and prior-year prices widens. As a result, the inflation rate is likely to go up somewhat 
further still for a temporary period. This will be all the more relevant when base effects 
also dampening the core rate cease to apply – in this case, prices of travel services fell 
considerably in the previous year. At the beginning of next year, one-off effects will also 
have a price-driving effect. These include the price rise for the “Deutschlandticket” and 
probably also substantial increases in private health insurance tariffs. Without these 
one-off effects, the core rate is likely to gradually trend downwards. The strong wage 
growth in 2024 will keep inflation high, however, especially for services.


The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 1136 German economy likely to see weak fourth quarter, too
The lull in activity in the German economy is likely to persist in the fourth quarter as 
well.  Industry and construction are likely to remain a drag on economic output. Factors 
weighing on the propensity to invest, such as high uncertainty, financing costs that are 
still relatively high, and low capacity utilisation in industry, remain in place. Foreign 
demand for German industrial products is still weak, even if a recovery is imminent 
here. According to  Institute surveys, the share of firms in the main construction ifo
sector reporting a shortage of orders remained high in October, and equipment utilisa-
tion declined again slightly on the previous quarter. The labour market will probably 
continue to cool, with moderately declining employment and a slight rise in unemploy-
ment. Nevertheless, private consumption could expand again somewhat, as the 
substantially higher wages offer further scope for additional consumer spending. 
Consumers remain unsettled, however, and will probably make only tentative use of 
their additional scope for spending. All in all, economic output could be more or less 
stagnant in the fourth quarter.
Private consumption and service providers are expected to provide further support 
for the economy in the current quarter . Private consumption continues to benefit 
from substantially higher wages. However, consumer sentiment remains subdued 
according to surveys conducted by the market research institute  In October, .GfK
income expectations and the propensity to purchase increased in particular. The  GfK
consumer climate index forecast for November improved, but remained at a low level. 
Impetus could come from car purchases. Private vehicle registrations saw a steep rise 
in October compared with the previous month and the average of the previous quarter, 
according to data from the German Association of the Automotive Industry. Surveys 
conducted by the  Institute are delivering mixed signals for consumer-related ifo
services. While business conditions improved in the retail sector, they deteriorated in 
accommodation and food services. However, the services sector as a whole is likely to 
continue to support the economy. The business situation as surveyed by the  Insti-ifo
tute improved markedly in this context. 14) 
14 See  (2024).GfK

The German economy
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 114Industry is unlikely to gain momentum in the fourth quarter either.  Demand for 
German industrial products still tends to be weak. Averaged over the third quarter, 
industrial new orders significantly outstripped those of the previous quarter, but 
excluding volatile large orders they were actually slightly down on the previous quarter. 
This is due to a sharp drop in new orders from Germany. However, excluding large 
orders, order intake from abroad increased for the second quarter in a row, indicating 
an incipient recovery in foreign demand for German industrial products. In line with the 
overall weak demand, capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector declined further 
in October according to the  Institute. The share of firms reporting a shortage of ifo
orders also continued to rise. Business expectations were somewhat less pessimistic in 
October but, equally, a rapid improvement is unlikely seeing as business conditions and 
export expectations have deteriorated further. Short-term production plans were also 
below the level of the third quarter, although they improved on the previous month. A 
first indication of a subdued start to the fourth quarter is also given by the number of 
cars produced, which was somewhat lower in October than the average of the previous 
quarter, according to the German Association of the Automotive Industry.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 1181 General government budget
1.1 Outlook for 2024 and 2025
Only moderate changes in the general government deficit and debt ratio are 
currently on the cards, although a new course is likely to be set after the general 
election.
The deficit ratio will probably fall slightly in 2024 (2023: 2.6 %), and in the absence of 
new government bills, a further small decline appears likely for 2025. However, this is 
due to fairly strong, opposing developments.
The expiry of temporary measures previously in place to address the energy crisis is 
having a lowering effect on the deficit.  Overall, these measures increased the deficit 
by around 1½ % of  in 2023. Around half of these burdens were attributable to the GDP
electricity and gas price brakes, which expired at the end of 2023. Their expiry should 
not have a particularly restrictive impact on economic developments, as gas and 
electricity prices at the upstream stages are significantly lower again. In this respect, 
the brakes have had a similar effect to an automatic stabiliser. Paying out temporary 
wage components tax and social contribution-free (inflation compensation bonuses), 
which is currently the second largest expenditure item, is only possible until the end of 
2024. This has caused significant revenue shortfalls for general government in 2023 
and 2024.
By contrast, additional expenditure in some areas and the phase of economic 
weakness are increasing the deficit.  The Armed Forces Fund and the Climate Fund are 
likely to have significantly higher outflows overall than in 2023. It remains difficult to 
gauge precisely what this will look like. The high inflation rates of recent years are  1)

Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 119continuing to leave their mark with a time lag, particularly in the form of sharply rising 
personnel expenditure, with the public sector lagging behind the private sector. At the 
same time, more subdued price dynamics and weak developments in the real economy 
are, when viewed in isolation, reducing growth in taxes and social contributions. In 
addition, weak economic developments are driving up labour market-related expendi-
ture temporarily. Moreover, spending on pensions, healthcare and long-term care is 
rising dynamically. Overall, the social security funds are likely to record deficits and 
draw on their reserves, and that is in spite of considerably higher contribution rates 
(see also the supplementary information entitled “ Social contribution rates to rise 
”). sharply
The debt ratio could fall moderately by the end of 2025 (end-2023: 62.9 %). Its decline 
is decelerating compared with the previous two years. This is because nominal  in GDP
the denominator is growing much more slowly, and the deficit ratio is only slightly 
lower. Viewed in isolation, a debt-financed generational capital fund would increase the 
debt ratio.
1.2 Fiscal policy facing challenges
The outlook for government finances depends to a significant extent on the course 
that is set for economic and fiscal policy.  There is a consensus that Germany is facing 
significant challenges, particularly as a result of demographic change, high energy 
costs and global economic and geopolitical developments. In this context, the task of 
the state is, not least, to ensure adequate framework conditions for the social market 
economy. Central government has a pivotal role to play in this. However, state and local 
governments must also do their part in their respective spheres of responsibility.
From the Bundesbank’s perspective, sound government finances and binding fiscal 
rules are key to ensuring fiscal and economic resilience and tackling the challenges 
ahead.  This is because adequate framework conditions must also include government 
debt staying within limits consistent with stability. Binding fiscal rules are there to 
safeguard this. To avoid overwhelming government finances even in view of the 
challenges faced at present, it is important to provide services efficiently and to review 
existing expenditure and special rules on taxes and social contributions.
In the case of a low debt ratio, a moderate increase in borrowing scope is then justi-
fiable from a stability policy perspective.  The Bundesbank has proposed a reformed 
debt brake with a two-tier borrowing limit that could be used to give preferential treat-

Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 120ment to investment expenditure. For example, the first limit for structural net borrow-
ing could be set at ½ % of  and the second limit at 1½ % of  Any amount GDP . GDP
borrowed in the second tier would need to be demonstrably matched by that same 
amount of net investment.  The binding deficit ceiling, including protected expendi-
ture (here: 1½ %), is crucial in order to reliably restrict the debt ratio. Under plausible 
assumptions, a deficit ratio of 1½ % of  would stabilise the debt ratio at around the GDP
60 % reference value specified in the  rules. Separately, compliance with the require-EU
ments set out in the  rules must also be ensured.EU
It has not yet been decided what budget limits under the new EU fiscal rules will 
apply to Germany from 2025 onwards.  Germany itself has not yet submitted an 
adjustment plan for this purpose. Assessments conducted in June were already point-
ing to some need for consolidation.  Moreover, the comparatively unfavourable devel-
opments seen since then must additionally be taken into account. Germany’s plan 
should factor this in and implement the new fiscal rules stringently. This is the only way 
for the Federal Government to credibly advocate that the rules be applied throughout 
the European Union in a stability-oriented manner. The deficit and debt ratios in some 
Member States remain persistently high. The new rules should aim to change this. 
However, the great complexity of the requirements for country-specific budget limits 
has already become apparent. Moreover, the procedure in which the Member State, 
the European Commission and  set the budget limits is fairly opaque. It is now Ecofin
necessary to establish clear requirements and to explain and implement them in a 
comprehensible manner. In order to strengthen confidence in sound government 
finances in the euro area, it is important for the reformed rules to get off to a good 
start. 3) 
 4) 
 5) 
3 Net investment is investment after deducting write-downs. Replacement investment would not be debt-fi-
nanced in line with a golden rule, which is why it is omitted from the second tier. Alternatively, special expendi-
ture could be given similarly preferential treatment by means of special funds.
4 Ecofin  will determine the requirements for the Member States on the basis of the national medium-term fiscal-
structural plans and the recommendations of the European Commission. Ecofin’s decision is scheduled for the 
beginning of 2025. For information on the new  rules with a focus on their application in Germany, see Indepen-EU
dent Advisory Board to the Stability Council (2024).
5 See Darvas et al. (2024). Given a four-year plan, Germany has a consolidation requirement of 0.1 % of  on GDP
average per year. Given a seven-year plan, only marginal annual consolidation is identified (the prerequisite 
for an extended plan is a reform programme to be reviewed by the Commission in due course).

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 1212 Budgetary development of central, state and local 
government
2.1 Tax revenue
2.1.1 Third quarter of 2024
Tax revenue rose by 1½ % in the third quarter (or +€3 billion).  A sharp decline in 
income tax on dividends (-€6 billion) overshadowed otherwise solid growth. This fall 
was due to intra-year shifts compared with the previous year and a large dividend 
payment made last year raising revenue for that year. By contrast, revenue from the  EU
solidarity contribution introduced in response to the energy crisis had a bolstering 
effect. This is a special levy on the profits of companies in the fossil fuel sector, 
collected in the third quarter. 6) 
6 The  solidarity contribution applies to profits in 2022 and 2023 only. This generated government revenue of EU
just under €2 billion this year from taxation for 2022. The tax estimate expects revenue of €1 billion next year.

Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 122At 6½ %, growth in wage tax receipts was dynamic.  Growth was thus stronger than in 
the first half of the year (see Table 5.1). The fact that taxable regular wage adjustments 
gradually replaced tax-free inflation compensation bonuses is likely to have played a 
role here. However, tax cuts at the beginning of the year – especially to compensate for 
the bracket creep of the previous year – are continuing to significantly slow growth.
Revenue from profit-related taxes decreased by 8 % due to a one-off effect on 
income tax on dividends. Excluding this tax, it rose dynamically.  The slump in income 
tax on dividends is due to the fact that a large dividend payment by a logistics company 
last year raised revenue for that year. In addition, this year dividend distributions were 
concentrated more in the second quarter – in 2023, these had been concentrated more 
in the third quarter. By contrast, withholding tax on interest income and capital gains 
continued to rise sharply. The increase is likely to be mainly attributable to a significant 
rise in interest income. This is because the average interest rate level for deposits was 
still noticeably higher than in the previous year. Revenue from assessed income tax 
rose considerably. Compensation for bracket creep slowed here too, albeit to a much 
lesser extent than wage tax. By contrast, revenue from corporation tax fell significantly. 
There was a moderate fall in advance payments for the current year, a major revenue 
item.


Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 123Revenue from VAT stagnated. Adjusted for the exceptionally high level of the previ-
ous year, however, it is likely to have risen significantly, by around 5 %.  In August 
last year, there were a significant amount of lagged payments for periods further back 
in time. Adjusted for this effect, growth in  was probably also based on tax cuts that VAT
had expired: the reduced  rate on restaurant meals came to an end at the close of VAT
2023. Natural gas and district heating rate cuts expired at the end of the first quarter of 
2024.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 1252.1.2 Official tax estimate
According to the updated official tax estimate, tax revenue will go up by just under 
3 % on the year in 2024. Legislative changes are reducing growth slightly.  Overall, the 
estimators expect tax growth to be somewhat stronger than suggested by the Federal 
Government’s macroeconomic assumptions and legislative changes. This is mainly due 
to cash developments thus far – first and foremost the sharp increase in tax revenue 
from interest income.
Wage tax revenue will rise by 5½ %, and thus on a similar scale to gross wages and 
salaries. Compensation for the high bracket creep of the previous year will reduce the 
growth rate by 4½ percentage points. However, this roughly corresponds to the 
additional revenue generated by price-related bracket creep plus real wage-related 
automatic income tax increases in the current year.
Overall, profit-related taxes will rise slightly, which is due entirely to the strong 
growth in withholding tax on interest income and capital gains.  Without this, 
revenue would fall markedly, largely in line with macroeconomic assumptions regard-
ing the development of profits. Profit-related taxes are moving in different directions: 
there are sharp declines in both corporation tax and income tax on dividends. By 
contrast, assessed income tax and local business tax are moving sideways.
Revenue from VAT will only grow by 2½ %, despite the VAT rate cuts having come to 
an end. The major item nominal household consumption, which is based on the 
Federal Government’s autumn projection, is rising only moderately.
In 2025, tax revenue is projected to increase by 4½ %. The assumed macroeconomic 
developments actually point to growth of just 3 %. In particular, however, it will no 
longer be possible to pay out temporary wage components tax-free (inflation compen-
sation bonus). Taken in isolation, this will boost growth in revenue from wage tax by 3 
percentage points. 7)

7 The official tax estimate only takes account of legislative changes that are already in force.
8 Inflation and real income growth automatically lead to higher tax burdens via the progressive income tax 
scale. In recent years, federal legislators have regularly compensated for the inflation-driven increase in 
average tax rates (see also Deutsche Bundesbank (2022)).
9 The tax estimate expects tax refunds from 2025 onwards on the basis of a Federal Fiscal Court ruling. Between 
2026 and 2029, these will amount to an annual average of €1½ billion. In the national accounts, the sum of the 
expected repayments at the time of the ruling’s announcement in 2024 is recognised as expenditure (asset 
transfer).

Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 126For 2026, the tax estimate projects an increase of 4½ %, followed by an average of 
3½ % in the subsequent years up to 2029.  The increases are driven primarily by 
assumptions about macroeconomic growth and fiscal drag. Legislative changes will 
give a slight boost to growth in 2026. In 2028 and 2029, legislative changes will slow 
revenue growth down markedly: higher social contribution rates, in particular, will lead 
to shortfalls in revenue from wage tax and income tax. The estimate does not factor in 
the usual compensation for bracket creep because it is based on current legislation.
2.1.3 Additional tax cuts initiated
The Federal Government had initiated or planned tax cuts (beyond what was 
covered by the tax estimate). In particular, it intended to lower wage and income 
tax. Specifically, a shift in the 2025 income tax rates was planned in order to compen-
sate for the bracket creep of 2024. Such compensation has been customary for some 
time now and is essentially undisputed in the political arena. The precise form it will 
take and the date of implementation are currently unclear. The Bundestag has already 
passed a bill to raise the income tax-free allowances for 2024 retroactively. This step is 
intended to take account of the price and wage increases that factor into the extrapola-
tion of standard financial needs. It is due to be implemented in December 2024, which 
would reduce wage tax revenue from January 2025 onwards. Overall, the tax revenue 
shortfalls compared to the tax estimate are likely to amount to around 1 % of tax 
revenue ‒ if, in addition to the two measures (which have not yet been enacted), it is 
assumed that bracket creep will be broadly compensated for in 2025.
Additional shortfalls will arise in the years that follow if there is further compensation 
for the bracket creep of the previous year. The Federal Government had also been 
planning to introduce accelerated tax depreciation methods again. These plans appear 
to have been abandoned now ‒ but improving investment incentives will probably be 
on the agenda of a new Federal Government, too. 
In general, there are also legal uncertainties, not least with regard to revenue from 
the solidarity surcharge  (annual revenue: ¼ % of  A constitutional complaint ). GDP

increase slightly (revenue of ⅓ % of  However, the details of how the tax is to be ). GDP

are some legal risks here, too.
2.1.4 Significant downward revision compared with May
Compared with the tax estimate of May 2024, the new tax estimate contains notice-
able revenue shortfalls. In addition to the weaker developments seen this year, this 
is also due to less favourable macroeconomic assumptions .This year, net shortfalls 
will amount to €8½ billion. Next year, they will rise to €12½ billion and then remain 
roughly at that level. Estimates for the years from 2024 to 2028 are thus ¼ % of  GDP
lower than in May. This is due, first, to weak cash developments this year. Second, it 
heavily reflects less favourable macroeconomic assumptions, primarily those regarding 
profit-related taxes. Revenue is only slightly reduced by legislative changes that have 
been adopted in the meantime.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 1292.2 Central government finances
2.2.1 Third quarter of 2024
The deficit of central government including off-budget entities was markedly higher 
in the third quarter of 2024 than in the previous year. The increase was primarily 
due to one-off effects.  The deficit climbed from €9 billion to just over €19 billion. On 
balance, this was mainly due to a sharp rise in the Climate Fund’s deficit.
In the core budget, the deficit fell slightly. At 7½ %, central government revenue rose 
steeply. Tax revenue climbed by 3½ %, bolstered by a decline in deductions for transfers 
to the  budget, whilst other current revenue grew strongly. The  toll, for EU HGV
instance, rose steeply (on account of the surcharge for greenhouse gas emissions). 
Additional revenue of €2 billion was generated by the dissolution of the Digitalisation 
Fund and the transfer of reserves to the core budget. Expenditure grew only slightly 
less strongly than revenue. The increase in the former was chiefly due to the fact that 
interest expenditure was lower in the previous year on account of a one-off effect: 
payments to be made at the start of July 2023 were already being recorded in the 
second quarter, while this year, they were recorded in the third quarter again. On 
balance, the interest expenditure rise totalling €6 billion compared with the same 
quarter of the previous year was almost exclusively attributable to this effect.

Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 130The deficit in the off-budget entities rose sharply due to strong outflows of funds 
and a revenue-side one-off effect in the Climate Fund.
Following a moderate surplus in the same quarter of the previous year, the 
Climate Fund recorded a large deficit of €9 billion. The green electricity subsidies 
financed by the Climate Fund this year added €5 billion to the deficit on their own. 
On top of this, investment grants issued saw fairly strong growth of €2 billion. 
Meanwhile, the fund generated €3 billion less from greenhouse gas emission 
allowances. This is ultimately due to a one-off effect, as sales of allowances were 
postponed to the final quarter.
In the Armed Forces Fund, the deficit climbed by €2½ billion to just over €4 billion. 
This increase reflects additional spending on procurement.
The Digitalisation Fund is being dissolved and its reserves transferred to the core 
budget. In the third quarter, this resulted in a €2 billion deficit (following only a 
slight deficit in the same period of the previous year).
In the Economic Stabilisation Fund  by contrast, the fact that energy price ( ),ESF
assistance had ceased at the end of 2023 brought relief this year. The assistance

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 131measures had contributed €3 billion to the deficit in the same quarter of 2023. In 
2024, a surplus of €4½ billion in the  was generated by somewhat higher ESF
repayments of coronavirus and energy price assistance loans.
 
2.2.2 2024 as a whole
From the current perspective, the core budget deficit is likely to remain consider-
ably below the estimated €49 billion.  According to the October tax estimate, tax 
revenue will be €3½ billion below budget estimates (after deducting global revenue 
shortfalls of €2 billion). However, this will be offset by unbudgeted privatisation 
proceeds of €3½ billion.  On the expenditure side, despite additional burdens from 
the basic allowance, there is set to be significant relief on balance relative to the budget 
plan. Lower interest expenditure and personnel spending, not least, are on the cards. 
 11) 
11 Although fairly high revenue of €13 billion from the  off-budget entity NextGenerationEU  is still EU ( ) NGEU
outstanding, nothing thus far suggests that the budget estimates might be missed.

Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 132In addition, planned loans of €12 billion to the generational capital fund are no longer 
expected, as the pension package was not ultimately passed prior to the collapse of the 
coalition government. Overall, the deficit in the core budget could thus be smaller than 
planned – by somewhat more than this sum of €12 billion.
The coalition government collapsed in November. A previously planned supplemen-
tary budget for 2024 has not been approved, but this could still happen. The govern-
ment draft has been passed on to the Bundestag, which could yet update it and make 
amendments beyond that. A supplementary budget would have to comply with the 
requirements of the debt brake.
An updated supplementary budget is likely to open up some scope with regard to 
the debt brake. As previously described, fiscal developments in 2024 are expected to be 
better than planned. However, some major factors are not counted towards the debt 
brake. For instance, the relief relative to the budget plan described above primarily 
concerns financial transactions. Higher than planned privatisation proceeds and lower 
than planned expenditure on the generational capital fund do not have any positive 
effect on structural net borrowing relevant to the debt brake. However, the scope for 
borrowing under the debt brake will expand considerably, as the debt brake-relevant 
cyclical burden on the budget resulting from the weaker than projected development 
of nominal  is set to be substantially higher (by around €12 billion, based on the GDP
Federal Government’s autumn projection).
Overall, then, it seems plausible that the upper limit of the debt brake will be under-
shot significantly – by more than €10 billion – in 2024.  In view of this, the Bundestag 
could decide to make less recourse to the reserve than originally planned. However, it 
could also incorporate new measures into the supplementary budget in order to make 
full use of the room in the budget. The Federal Government’s draft supplementary 
budget, for instance, provided for increased transfers of €10 billion to the Climate 
Fund. Additional aid for Ukraine, measures to promote investment and subsidies for 
energy costs (grid fees) are just some of the measures currently under discussion. In 
view of the interim management of the budget foreseeable for 2025, investment 
projects could be brought forward, were a voting majority to support this.
The deficit of the off-budget entities is likely to be somewhat lower than planned.
This is on account of very disparate factors. 12) 
12 The actual amount could even be a mid-single-digit billion higher if the accruals-basis accounting of interest 
expenditure already planned for 2025 were to be brought forward to 2024. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2024b).

Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 133The debt-financed Armed Forces Fund looks set to record a smaller than planned 
deficit.  After the first three quarters of the year, only one-half of its budgeted funds 
had been spent. The obligations arising from procurement contracts reported at the 
budget outturn for 2023 and the usual delays in new contracts suggest that the 
planned deficit of €20 billion will be significantly undershot.
The deficit in the Climate Fund is likely to be somewhat lower than planned, even 
excluding additional government grants from the central government’s draft supple-
mentary budget.  After three quarters, the deficit stood at €24 billion – already fairly 
close to the projected €29 billion. However, with estimated annual revenues of just over 
€20 billion, it appears that around three-quarters of the receipts from emission 
allowances sales were still outstanding. Despite far higher than planned expenditure 
on green electricity subsidies laid down in the Renewable Energy Sources Act ( Erneuer-
 –   then, a somewhat more favourable than expected result is bare-Energien-Gesetz ),EEG
on the cards. Specifically, grants of €4 billion towards a chip manufacturing plant in 
Saxony-Anhalt that were planned this year are not the only funds that will no longer be 
spent. Without further central government grants, though, only a small part of the 
reserve (amounting to just over €29 billion at the start of 2024) is likely to remain for 
expenditure already planned for subsequent years.
Lastly, there are surpluses in off-budget entities for which no economic plans have 
been published.  In the first instance, this concerns the  which will receive repay-,ESF
ments of emergency assistance loans granted during the coronavirus pandemic and 
energy price crisis. As at the end of the first three quarters of the year, this had already 
generated a surplus of €8½ billion. In addition, there are no economic plans for pension 
provision units such as the civil servants’ pension reserve and the civil servants’ pension 
fund. At the end of the first three quarters, these off-budget entities recorded a surplus 
of €2½ billion.
2.2.3 Plans for 2025
Now that the coalition government has collapsed, the Bundestag is not expected to 
adopt a budget for 2025 before a new election is held. The adjustment meeting that 
was originally meant to take place by the morning of 15 November 2024 was cancelled.
In the absence of a valid budget plan at the start of the new year, the rules for 
interim management of the budget will apply.  Under these rules, any government 
spending to fulfil legal and contractual obligations is authorised, though the govern-
ment has little scope for additional expenditure. However, extrabudgetary expenditure 

Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 134is an option in the event of unforeseeable and unavoidable needs arising. For the 
financing of total expenditure, there is scope for borrowing in addition to regular 
revenue. According to Article 111 of the Basic Law, the government may borrow up to 
one-quarter of the total amount of the previous year’s budget – a figure in the order of 
€120 billion. However, it must be borne in mind that the much tighter restrictions 
under the debt brake still apply and must be met when the 2025 budget is approved in 
due course.
All in all, interim budgetary management ensures stable fiscal policy and does not 
commit the government to pursuing an austerity policy.  For instance, there are 
already extensive obligations for 2025 in the off-budget entities that can be fulfilled just 
as well under interim budgetary management. Extrabudgetary expenditure can be 
used to respond to emergency situations. However, the timely adoption of a central 
government budget for 2025 would open up greater political scope. Accompanying 
economic plans would then also grant additional spending authorisations for off-bud-
get entities.
One judicial risk concerns revenue from the solidarity surcharge.  On 12 Novem-
ber 2024, the Federal Constitutional Court heard a constitutional complaint regarding 
this surcharge.  Rulings on such matters usually follow within a few months, i.e. a 
ruling can be presumably expected in 2025. The revenue of €13 billion expected in 
2025, according to the tax estimate, is deemed to be at increased risk on account of the 
surcharge. The Federal Constitutional Court could also require that revenue from previ-
ous years be repaid.
2.3 State government budgets
State government core budgets closed the third quarter with a slight surplus of 
€½ billion.  This represented a significant deterioration of just under €6 billion 
compared with the same quarter of the previous year. A one-off effect in Hesse played  13) 
 14) 13 The solidarity surcharge is a surtax on income tax, which is paid solely to central government. Deviation from 
the usual distribution of income tax revenue between central government, state governments and local 
governments is subject to certain conditions. For a discussion on the continuation of the solidarity surcharge 
beyond 2020, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2018), p. 60.

Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 135a key role here.  Revenue rose by 2½ %, with tax revenue seeing a 3 % increase. 
Expenditure grew considerably, by 7 % (+€8 billion). Spending on personnel, a large 
expenditure item, rose by 5 %. Other operating expenditure grew even more strongly, 
admittedly for the most part with a time lag due to price increases.
In the first half of the year, the earnings of state government core budgets and off-
budget entities deteriorated significantly, by €7 billion. They thus recorded a deficit of 
€3½ billion. Although taxes rose substantially, by 4½ %, overall revenue saw only 
sluggish growth of 1½ %. In particular, revenue from economic activity fell significantly: 
Hamburg received a very large dividend payment last year that will not be made in the 
current year.  Expenditure grew significantly more strongly, at 4½ %. This was mainly 
due to the steep increase in personnel expenditure. Inflation compensation bonuses 
had been paid out in the first half of the year, for instance.
For the year as a whole, the result is expected to deteriorate significantly on the year
(2023: deficit of just over €½ billion). According to the current tax estimate, tax revenue

14 Hesse withdrew silent contributions from its Landesbank (without impacting its budget) and transferred 
€2 billion from the core budget to the bank by way of compensation. Capital contributions are classed as recov-
erable, as the state anticipates income from dividends and interest. The capital contribution is thus considered 
a financial transaction. Hesse’s debt brake therefore enables credit financing.
15 See also Deutsche Bundesbank (2024c).

Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 136for the year as a whole will see only moderate growth of 2½ %, which suggests that 
growth will be very subdued in the final quarter. Expenditure is expected to increase at 
a significantly faster rate than revenue, not least as a result of the sharp rise in prices. 
This is also the case for spending on personnel, a major expenditure item – though this 
will probably rise more slowly in the second half of the year than in the first half.
From the current perspective, state government finances look set to improve 
slightly next year. Although personnel expenditure is likely to see continued marked 
growth as a result of wage adjustments, the strained budgetary situation will probably 
weigh on other expenditure categories – not least transfers to local government. At the 
same time, tax revenue growth could accelerate slightly again. On balance, then, 
revenue could rise somewhat more strongly than expenditure.

3.1 Pension insurance scheme
3.1.1 Outlook for 2024
The statutory pension insurance scheme recorded a deficit of €4½ billion in the third 
quarter. This was €1 billion higher than a year previously. Rising by 5½ %, revenue 
went up sharply. Without central government’s funding cut, the rise would have been 
just under ½ percentage point higher. At 6 %, expenditure grew even more strongly, 
with pensions increasing by 4½ % at mid-year. Compared with the previous year, the 
number of pensions also saw accelerated growth of ½ percentage point. Just over ½ 
percentage point of the increase in expenditure is attributable to new flat-rate supple-
ments for persons who began drawing their reduced earning capacity pensions 
between 2001 and 2018. 16) 
16 Since July 2024, the pension insurance scheme has been paying a flat-rate supplement to persons who began 
drawing their reduced earning capacity pensions between 2001 and 2018. These supplements are likely to 
have contributed €½ billion to the deficit in the third quarter. The pension insurance scheme will pay out 
almost €1½ billion in supplements in 2024 as a whole.

Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 138The pension insurance scheme could close 2024 with a deficit. In the same quarter 
of the previous year, it posted a surplus of €1½ billion.  After the first three quarters, 
the pension insurance scheme recorded a cumulated deficit of €4½ billion (previous 
year: deficit of just over €2½ billion). In the fourth quarter, a significant seasonal 
surplus is usually generated, as contribution receipts from bonuses are expected. In 
addition, earnings subject to compulsory contributions are increasingly replacing social 
contribution-exempt inflation compensation bonuses; this is likely to raise receipts 
somewhat more significantly than has been the case so far this year. At around 
€44 billion, the free reserves (sustainability reserve) would continue to considerably 
exceed the minimum value of 0.2 times the scheme’s monthly expenditure (around 
€5½ billion).


Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 1393.1.2 Outlook for the coming years
In 2025, the deficit is likely to expand considerably. Contribution receipts are 
expected to increase markedly, not least because of earnings subject to compulsory 
contributions replacing social contribution-exempt inflation compensation bonuses. In 
addition, expenditure is likely to continue seeing fairly dynamic growth: pensions are 
set to be raised considerably in mid-2025. The number of pensions is likely to increase 
even more rapidly due to demographic factors. This will be accompanied by additional 
expenditure of another almost €1½ billion on the supplement to pensions for reduced 
earning capacity that was introduced in mid-2024.
From the mid-2020s onwards, demographic factors will weigh significantly more 
heavily on pension funds.  On the expenditure side, the pressure will increase as partic-
ularly large birth cohorts reach retirement age. This will also weigh on revenue. Contri-
bution rates will then have to rise considerably (see also the supplementary informa-
tion entitled “ ”). Social contribution rates to rise sharply
3.2 Federal Employment Agency
The Federal Employment Agency achieved a balanced budget in the third quarter, 
following a surplus of €1 billion one year previously.  This deterioration was driven 
by a steep increase in expenditure (+17 %), above all on unemployment benefits 
(+19 %). This is chiefly attributable to a significantly higher number of recipients (+13 %). 
Active labour market policy expenditure also rose sharply (+14 %). Administrative spend-
ing increased by 10½ %, with the Federal Employment Agency substantially raising 
transfers to its civil servants’ pension fund. At 6 %, Federal Employment Agency revenue 
also grew considerably, but to a much lesser extent than expenditure. 17) 
 18) 
17 The Federal Government had previously planned to cut government contributions to the pension insurance 
scheme on an ad hoc basis by just over an additional €1 billion. The legal provisions to this effect had not yet 
been made when the coalition government collapsed, however. Central government had already reduced its 
funding by just over €1 billion per year for the years 2024 to 2027 in order to relieve the pressure on its budget.
18 In the core budget, i.e. excluding the civil servants’ pension fund of the Federal Employment Agency. The 
transfers to this fund come out of the core budget, but lead to a surplus for the fund.

Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 140The Federal Employment Agency could also achieve a broadly balanced result for 
the year as a whole. This would represent a deterioration on the previous year 
(2023: +€3 billion). A surplus of €2 billion was still envisaged in the budget plan. At the 
end of the first three quarters, the Federal Employment Agency recorded a cumulated 
deficit of €1 billion (previous year: +€1½ billion). A surplus is regularly generated in the 
final quarter of the year owing to contributions paid on seasonal bonuses. Compound-
ing this, contributions are likely to rise sharply, partly because regular wage compo-
nents are increasingly replacing social contribution-exempt inflation compensation 
bonuses. However, there are no signs of spending growth tailing off. Expenditure is 
thus likely to rise much more sharply than revenue.
A deficit is expected next year as unemployment rises and average per capita 
benefits increase along with wages. The Federal Employment Agency’s contribution 
receipts are likely to continue growing markedly, especially as regular wages come to 
replace social contribution-exempt inflation compensation bonuses. However, 
unemployment is likely to rise, and average per capita benefits will probably increase 
significantly owing to the strong wage developments to date. On top of this, federal 
legislators have decided to reimburse the Federal Employment Agency less in adminis-
trative costs for recipients of the civic allowance in order to relieve the pressure on their 
own budget, increasing the deficit once more. In view of the Federal Government’s

Employment Agency anticipates a deficit of almost €1½ billion next year.

Social contribution rates to rise sharply
Social contribution rates will rise sharply next year. In view of demographic trends, 
they are expected to rise significantly in the years ahead, too.
Developments in 2025
The average contribution rate to the statutory health insurance ( )SHI  scheme will 
rise sharply in 2025.  This is due to significant increases in benefits spending. For 2025, 
the group of  estimators has calculated a notional supplementary contribution rate SHI
of 2.5 % to cover expenditure. In light of cash reserves being largely depleted, it 
appears plausible that the actual average supplementary contribution rate will also rise 
to around 2.5 %. That would amount to an increase of 0.7 percentage point. Altogether, 
then, the average overall contribution rate to the  scheme would be around 17 %.SHI
A higher contribution rate to the public long-term care insurance scheme is also 
expected next year.  It was only back in mid-2023 that legislators significantly raised 
the general contribution rate, increasing it by 0.35 percentage point to 3.4 %.  
However, as expenditure is rising more strongly than contributions this year, a consid-
erable deficit is on the cards for 2024. As a result, the scheme’s reserves will presum-
ably only reach their minimum target this year. While spending growth is likely to 
weaken somewhat next year, it will probably still remain strong. The Federal Ministry of 
Health has therefore decided to raise the contribution rate by 0.2 percentage point in 
order to secure funding.
Social contributions to the SHI and long-term care insurance schemes have the 
same effect as taxes and therefore reduce incentives to work.  This is due to the fact 
that contributions increase alongside wages up to the contribution assessment ceiling, 
whereas the benefits received by an insured person are largely independent of the  1) 
 2) 1 The general contribution rate to the public long-term care insurance scheme applies to persons subject to 
compulsory contributions who have one child. The rate is higher for childless persons (4 %) and lower for 
those with multiple children.

Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 143amount they have paid in contributions.  The one exception is sick pay (around 6½ % 
of  scheme expenditure), which is paid out as needed in line with contribution SHI
payments.
The higher contribution rates to the SHI and long-term care insurance schemes will 
also raise the overall social contribution rate in 2025. Following on from a prolonged 
period of being broadly stable, this is likely to bring the contribution rate close to its 
previous peak. In recent years, the strong growth in employment, the pause in 
demographic change (largely stable pension numbers) and expenditure-saving reforms 
have been the main factors to significantly alleviate the financial pressure on the social 
security schemes. Employment benefited from factors such as structural reforms in the 
labour market in the early 2000s. The contribution rates to the unemployment insur-
ance scheme and, to a lesser extent, the pension insurance scheme fell by a total of 
almost 5 percentage points from their respective peaks in the 2000s up to and includ-
ing 2024 (see Chart 5.7). In the same period, however, the contribution rates to the  SHI
and long-term care insurance schemes rose sharply, going up by 4 percentage points. 
This was due to numerous benefit expansions and high cost pressures.
Parts of the social security schemes are subsidised out of the central government 
budget and thus create an additional tax wedge.  Since the early 2000s, government 
funds to the social security schemes have increased only moderately more strongly 
overall than the contribution base. 2) 
 3) 
2 This distinguishes the  and long-term care insurance schemes from the unemployment and pension insur-SHI
ance schemes: the benefits provided by the latter two schemes increase in line with the insured person’s 
contribution payments, all other things being equal. The contributions then have a less distortive effect. See 
also Deutsche Bundesbank (2024d).
3 Central government introduced a regular grant for the  scheme. However, liquidity support for the SHI
unemployment insurance scheme was no longer provided and the relative weight of government funds to the 
pension insurance scheme decreased. This is due to the fact that these are mostly adjusted in line with per 
capita wages and contribution rates. Given the strong growth in employment, contributions paid went up 
more strongly than the government funds.

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 144Developments in the years ahead
Looking ahead, the overall social contribution rate is set to continue rising. This is 
 Growing because demographic trends will result in dynamic expenditure growth.
numbers of individuals in older, larger birth cohorts will reach retirement age and leave 
the labour market. Taken in isolation, this will weigh on the government revenue base. 
Pension expenditure, in particular, will rise sharply as well due to the number of individ-
uals entering retirement. Following a slight lag, the shift in the age pyramid will then 
also increasingly affect spending by the  and long-term care insurance schemes. SHI
This is because the lion’s share of this expenditure will be on old or very old insured 
persons. In the  scheme, medical and technological advances could further increase SHI
spending pressures.
There are no official projections for the long-term development of social contribu-
tion rates.  The Federal Government’s annual pension insurance report shows how the 
finances of the pension insurance scheme, including the contribution rate and the level

Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 145of benefits, will develop over the next 15 years according to its projections.  However, 
projections covering a far longer horizon of around 50 years would be a useful tool for 
assessing benefit adjustments – such as in the Ageing Reports of the European Commis-
sion.  Furthermore, there are no official long-term projections for the  and long-SHI
term care insurance schemes outlining at least the effects of those demographic devel-
opments that are foreseeable. It is important for persons subject to compulsory contri-
butions to keep prospective contribution rate increases in mind. Otherwise, there is a 
danger that this aspect will not be sufficiently taken into account in discussions on 
benefit adjustments and expansions. The Federal Government should therefore be 
more transparent.
Appropriate reforms can rein in expenditure increases, thereby counteracting the 
pressure on contribution rates. There are starting points for reform in all three pillars 
of the social security schemes in which significantly rising contribution rates are 
foreseeable.
Financing pressures resulting from demographic change can be reduced for the 
pension insurance scheme: incentives for early retirement could be minimised and 
the retirement age linked to rising life expectancy. Full pensions without any deduc-
tions after 45 years of contributions are a financial incentive for early retirement, and 
the standard deductions for early retirement could be set too low. As life expectancy 
rises, positive effects on pension funding will be observed if the retirement age is linked 
to life expectancy after 2031: the pension insurance scheme’s receipts would receive a 
boost and the rise in pension expenditure would be curbed.  In addition, considera-
tion could be given to including additional contribution years in the replacement rate  5)

scheme can be found, for example, in Deutsche Bundesbank (2023). See Federal Ministry of Finance (2024) and 
European Commission (2024) for information on long-term expenditure increases due to demographic factors.
6 According to the Commission’s report, age-related expenditure as a percentage of  will increase by 2 GDP
percentage points over the next 50 years. Long-term projections are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. 
The results should not be interpreted as point forecasts, either. Nevertheless, these projections are important: 
they highlight key trends, present relationships between individual variables and illustrate the impact of 
reforms from today’s perspective.

Public finances
Deutsche Bundesbank, Monthly Report – November 2024 146calculation in view of the higher retirement age.  This would mean that as the retire-
ment age rose from 65 to 67, the contribution period on which the standard pension is 
based would gradually be increased. For example, starting in 2031, the replacement 
rate would be based on 47 years of contributions instead of 45. This link could then be 
maintained in line with future changes in the statutory retirement age.
Structural reforms and efficiency gains could limit the strong trend increase in 
spending on benefits in the SHI scheme.  For example, a stronger focus on preventive 
healthcare and health promotion could help reduce healthcare spending in the long 
term.  In the fields of both outpatient and inpatient care, inefficiencies could be 
minimised by reducing disincentives and coordination problems.  Improving digitali-
sation and the use of treatment and procedure data for the scientific evaluation of treat-
ments and procedures also appears important. Overall, such measures could help 
prevent unnecessary duplicate testing and make treatments and procedures more 
efficient and at the same time more effective. Insured persons could also be made 
more cost aware, for example by bringing in some sort of surgery visit charge or charg-
ing certain deductibles.
Looking at the long-term care insurance scheme, the main decision to be made 
concerns the scope of insurance. One option would be for the scheme’s partial insur-
ance model to be retained or reinforced. Alternatively, there are calls in some quarters 
for the long-term care insurance scheme to be transformed into a relatively comprehen-
sive full insurance model. If recipients of long-term care no longer needed to rely on 
private assets and were only required to draw on their income to a very limited extent, 
this would go hand in hand with considerably higher social contributions (levied in the 
same way as taxes) for all insured persons. In a partial insurance model, costs of long-
term care are ultimately covered by assistance for long-term care for those who are  8)

8 For information on the dynamic adjustment of the replacement rate, see Deutsche Bundesbank (2019).
9 The Federal Government originally planned to expand on the pension benefits granted under the current legal 
framework (extension to the threshold of 48 % for the replacement rate). This would significantly increase the 
demographic pressure on social contributions. The extent to which this pension reform will be implemented 
currently remains unclear. See Deutsche Bundesbank (2023) for the implications of the planned pension 
package.
10 The weaker focus on preventive healthcare is due to risk structure compensation in its current form in the SHI
scheme. This arrangement entails the health insurance institutions receiving the expected costs for their insured 
persons each year. Health insurance institutions that make cost savings within that year then have a financial 
advantage. By contrast, long-term investment in prevention and new forms of care put individual health insur-
ance institutions at a financial disadvantage; see also Reif et al. (2024).
11 The German Council of Economic Experts and the Advisory Council on the Assessment of Developments in 
the Health Care System formulated recommendations in their respective reports in 2018; see German Council 
of Economic Experts (2018) and Advisory Council on the Assessment of Developments in the Health Care 
System (2018).

have sufficient financial resources of their own.
Central government’s financial situation is strained. Government funds to the social 
security schemes can only be increased by additionally raising taxes or making cuts 
elsewhere. Additional central government funds are sometimes seen as a way to plug 
the funding gaps that are on the horizon for the social security schemes. However, 
according to current fiscal planning, there is no leeway in the central government 
budget and it faces major challenges in other areas. In any case, it would be helpful if 
central government made the funds it allocates to the social security schemes more 
transparent and easier to understand. To this end, it could name and quantify the 
benefits that it classifies as non-contribution-based and therefore intends to finance 
out of government funds. The long-term projections for the social security schemes 
(see above) would then also shed light on central government’s financing needs in this 
regard.

Discrepancies may arise from rounding.  * The banking system's liquidity position is
defined as the current account holdings in euro of euro area credit institutions with the
Eurosystem. Amounts are derived from the consolidated financial statement of the
Eurosystem and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  1 Figures are daily averages
for the reserve maintenance period ending in the month indicated. Following the
changeover in the frequency of Governing Council monetary policy meetings to a
six-week cycle, a reserve maintenance period no longer ends in every month. No figuresare available in such cases.  2 Source: ECB.  3 Includes liquidity provided under the
Eurosystem's asset purchase programmes.  4 From August 2009 includes liquidity
absorbed as a result of the Eurosystem's foreign exchange swap operations.  5 From
2002 euro banknotes and other banknotes which have been issued by the national cen-
tral banks of the Eurosystem and which are still in circulation. In accordance with the
accounting procedure chosen by the Eurosystem for the issue of euro banknotes, a
share of 8% of the total value of the euro banknotes in circulation is

allocated to the ECB on a monthly basis. The counterpart of this adjustment is shown
under “Other factors”. The remaining 92% of the value of the euro banknotes in
circulation is allocated, likewise on a monthly basis, to the NCBs, with each NCB
showing in its balance sheet the share of the euro banknotes issued corresponding to
its paid-up share in the ECB's capital. The difference between the value of the euro
banknotes allocated to an NCB and the value of the euro banknotes which that NCB
has put into circulation is likewise shown under “Other factors”. From 2003 eurobanknotes only.  6 Remaining items in the consolidated financial statement of the Euro-
system and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  7 Equal to the difference bet-
ween the sum of liquidity-pro viding factors and the sum of liquidity-absorbing factors.
8 Calculated as the sum of the “Deposit facility”, “Banknotes in circulation” and “Credit
institutions' current account balances”.

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).

figures do not tally with the sum of the quarterly figures, as the latter are all pro-
visional. The quarterly figures for some insurance sectors are estimated.  3 The develop-
ment of the types of expenditure recorded here is influenced in part by statisticalchangeovers.  4 Including discrepancies in clearing transactions between central, state

posals of equity interests and as loan repayments. On the expenditure side, this con-
tains the acquisition of equity interests and loans granted.  6 Excluding central govern-
ment liquidity assistance to the Federal Employment Agency.

* The effective exchange rate corresponds to the weighted external value of the curren-
cy concerned. The method of calculating the indicators of the German economy's price
competitiveness is consistent with the procedure to compute the effective exchange
rates of the euro. A decline in the figures implies an increase in competitiveness. The
weights are based on trade in manufactured goods and services. For more detailed in-
formation on methodology and weighting scale, see the website of the Deutsche
Bundesbank (https://www.bundesbank.de/content/796162).  1 The calculations are
based on the weighted averages of the changes in the bilateral exchange rates of the
euro vis-à-vis the currencies of the following 18 countries: Australia, Bulgaria, Canada,
China, Czechia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan, Norway, Poland, Romania,
Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United
States. Where current price and wage indices were not available, estimates were used.
2 Includes countries belonging to the extended EER group of trading partners (fixed
composition) and additionally the following 23 countries: Algeria, Argentina, Brazil,
Chile, Colombia, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, New Zea-
land, Peru, Philippines, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Taiwan,Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and United Arab Emirates. The ECB has suspended the
publication and calculation of the euro foreign exchange reference rate against Russian
rouble with effect from March 2, 2022 until further notice. For the calculation of
effective exchange rates, an indicative rate is used for the Russian Federation from that
date. It is calculated from the daily RUB/USD rates determined by the Bank of Russia in
conjunction with the respective ECB's euro foreign exchange reference rate to the US
dollar.  3 Annual and quarterly averages.  4 Euro area countries (from 2001 including
