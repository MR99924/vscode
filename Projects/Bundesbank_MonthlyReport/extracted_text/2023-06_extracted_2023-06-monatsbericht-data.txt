Commentaries
Economic conditions
Lowest point may have been 
reached
According to revised data, the German econ -
omy continued to contract in the first quarter 
of 2023,1 which meant that it was in a tech -
nical recession in the past winter half- year.2 The 
decline in real gross domestic product (GDP) in 
the winter half- year was in line with the ex -
pectations expressed in the December 2022 
projection.3 However, real gross value added 
(GVA) saw only a comparatively small decrease 
overall and even rose sharply in the first quar -
ter.4 GDP is also expected to edge up again 
slightly in the current quarter, although some 
strains remain.5 External industrial demand 
continues to fall and is weighing on output and 
exports. Higher financing costs are dampening 
investment, pushing down domestic demand 
in a number of industrial sectors and in con -
struction. However, supply bottlenecks con -
tinue to dwindle in importance and the still 
very high order backlog is providing support. In 
addition, despite inflation still being high, 
households are slowly experiencing more scope 
for spending again, as inflation is in fact easing 
and wages are rising steeply. Furthermore, em -
ployment is growing. Beneficiaries of this envir -
onment are private consumption and service 
providers, which are likely expanding signifi -
cantly. Finally, government consumption is ex -
pected to pick up again, having fallen sharply 
in the first quarter due to pandemic- related ex -
penditure petering out.
Industry still sustained by 
order books
In seasonally adjusted terms, industrial output 
rose only slightly in April, after having fallen 
substantially in March. It thus remained clearly 
below the level of the first quarter. Energy-  intensive sectors, in particular, once again 
scaled back their output, despite energy prices 
being significantly lower again.6 One reason 
could be that for quite a while demand has 
tended to decline more sharply here than in 
other sectors. Industrial new orders went down 
slightly in April, following a sharp drop in 
March. The slowdown in demand is broadly 
spread across sectors and emanates from both 
domestic and foreign customers. The order 
backlog in industry is still comfortable, how -
ever. Car manufacturers, in particular, drew 
from this, sharply increasing their output in 
May. According to the German Association of 
the Automotive Industry (VDA), the number of 
units was almost back at the pre- pandemic 
level observed in the final quarter of 2019. The 
easing of bottlenecks in the supply of inter -
mediate products also played a supportive role 
here. Surveys conducted by the ifo Institute 
and S&P Global and also the Bundesbank’s re -
cent survey of firms (see the box on p. 23 f.) 
signal that these bottlenecks have generally 
continued to improve. Overall, industry is likely After technical

1 Seasonally adjusted real GDP declined in the first three 
months of the year by 0.3% on the quarter, after having 
already shrunk by 0.5% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Sea -
sonal adjustment here and in the remainder of this text also 
includes adjustment for calendar variations, provided they 
can be verified and quantified.
2 The term technical recession is used if economic output 
declines in two consecutive quarters.
3 See Deutsche Bundesbank (2022).
4 In addition, employment continued to increase and in -
vestment expanded again significantly in the first quarter. 
This means that there are no signs of a recession in the 
sense of a significant, broad-  based and persistent decline 
in German economic activity. According to the press re -
lease of the Federal Statistical Office, the difference be -
tween GVA and GDP stems from the modest net taxes on 
products; see Federal Statistical Office (2022).
5 For further information on the macroeconomic outlook, 
see pp. 13 ff. of this Monthly Report. Owing to the later 
cut- off date in comparison with the projection, there is al -
ready more information available for the assessment of the 
current economic situation in this commentary.
6 Energy- intensive sectors include the manufacture of 
chemicals and chemical products, the manufacture of basic 
metals, the manufacture of coke and refined petroleum 
products, the manufacture of other non- metallic mineral 
products and the manufacture of paper and paperboard.Deutsche Bundesbank

to largely withstand the decline in demand in 
the current quarter.
Private consumption 
recovering , service providers 
seeing growth
In April, retail trade in goods was higher than in 
March. Seasonally and price- adjusted sales 
were up significantly on the month, although 
they were still slightly below the average of the 
first three months of the year. The picture was 
not so rosy in the hotel and restaurant sector, 
however, where seasonally and price- adjusted 
sales fell sharply in April. This was mainly due 
to the catering sector, which was probably un -
able to make enough use of its outdoor seating 
areas owing to the overly wet weather condi -
tions in April.7 The hotel and restaurant sector 
should have fared better subsequently, how -
ever. The ifo Institute’s survey of the business 
situation improved substantially in May. Over -
all, consumer activity is likely to strengthen fur -
ther. According to the German Association of 
the Automotive Industry, new private car regis -
trations already rose significantly in May, al -
though averaged across April and May they 
were still markedly below the first- quarter level. 
In addition, the consumer climate as surveyed 
by the market research institution GfK im -
proved further in May, and so far service pro -
viders have been more satisfied with their busi -
ness in the second quarter than in the first 
three months. Services sector activity increased 
significantly in April and May according to S&P 
Global’s Purchasing Managers’ Index.
Labour market developments 
remain remarkably robust
The labour market has so far proved remark -
ably robust in the current phase of cyclical 
weakness. Nevertheless, employment barely

cantly in the first quarter of 2023. The season -
ally adjusted number of persons in work 
showed only a marginal increase on the month 
(18,000). Looking at the initial sectoral esti -
mate of jobs subject to social security contribu -
tions for March, the growth at that time was 
mainly confined to the health and social ser -
vices and the hotel and restaurant sectors. Ex -
clusively low- paid part- time employment fell in 
March for the first time since the catching- up 
process began in early 2022 in the wake of the 
pandemic. In March, the use of short- time 
work for economic reasons remained at the 
slightly higher level of the previous month. Al -
though the number of notifications of short-  
time work does not suggest a marked deterior -
ation in the situation, the ifo employment bar -
ometer dropped clearly in May, with no pro -
spect of any rise in employment in the next few 
months. The number of job vacancies reported 
to the Federal Employment Agency likewise de -
clined, but remains fairly high.
After adjustment for seasonal variations, regis -
tered unemployment rose by 9,000 persons to 
2.57 million in May. The unemployment rate 
held firm at 5.6%. The slight rise in the number 
of unemployed persons claiming insurance 
benefits, which has lasted for several months 
now, shows that cyclical factors are also partly 
responsible for the increase. By contrast, the 
change in the number of unemployed persons 
receiving the basic welfare allowance is due, 
among other things, to changes in the number 
of participants in language and integration 
courses. The total number of underemployed 
persons as calculated by the Federal Employ -
ment Agency, which also includes participants 
in these measures, has gone up somewhat 
more strongly than registered unemployment. 
For the next few months, registered unemploy -
ment is expected to rise if only because a con -
siderable number of Ukrainian refugees will fin -
ish their courses and not immediately take up 
employment afterwards. The unemployment 
barometer of the Institute for Employment Re -
search likewise indicates higher unemployment 
over the next few months.Inflation rate declined further 
in May
Energy and commodity prices continued to de -
cline in May and June, partly due to the sub -
dued outlook for global demand. Brent crude 
oil cost US$77 per barrel at last report, and 
thus around 9% less than in April. Prices are 
expected to drop further based on forward 
quotations. However, the International Energy 
Agency’s assessment that the global oil market 
is likely to be distinctly undersupplied in the 
coming months suggests otherwise. This also 
reflects Saudi Arabia’s decision to cut its pro -
duction further in July. European wholesale 
prices for natural gas fell at a similar rate to 
crude oil prices. A megawatt hour of gas cur -
rently costs €39, less than one- third of the 
average price last year. Gas prices are likely to 
rise again somewhat in the coming months as 
demand goes up due to seasonal factors. For -
ward quotations also give indications of this.
Price pressures at the upstream stages of the 
economy have tended to decline further. Im -
port prices were down both on the month and 
on the year, falling by 7% year on year in April, 
the most recent month for which data are 
available. Domestic producer prices, which are 
a more near-term leading indicator of con -
sumer prices, also dropped in May compared 
with the previous month. The rate of price in -
crease was still positive in year- on- year terms. 
In May, however, it fell to 1.0%, its lowest level 
since the end of 2020. The decline in price 
pressures at the upstream stages should grad -
ually be reflected in consumer prices.
The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices 
(HICP) fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.2% on the 
month in May. Energy and services were the 
driving forces behind the lower prices. By con -
trast, consumer prices for industrial goods and 
food continued to increase. In annual terms, 
the harmonised inflation rate declined again 
significantly to 6.3%, which was 1.3 percent -Marginal

age points lower than in the previous month.8 
In addition to the oil price- driven drop in prices 
in the energy component, the introduction of 
the €49 monthly travel ticket for regional trans -
port (Deutschlandticket)  is likely to have 
lowered headline HICP inflation by around 
0.3 percentage point. The core inflation rate, 
which excludes volatile energy and food prices, 
likewise weakened by 0.5 percentage point to 
5.1%. Without the dampening effect of the 
Deutschlandticket,  however, it hardly changed.
It is likely that the rate of inflation in Germany 
will generally continue on a downward trajec -
tory in the next few months. The trend of de -
clining price pressures at the upstream stages 
of the economy and lower wholesale energy 
prices are now filtering through to consumer 
prices. Above all, based on the current paths of 
commodity prices, the currently still high infla -
tion rate for food and other goods should 
gradually ease to a greater extent. However, 
underlying price pressures are likely to remain 
very high for the time being. This harbours the 
risk that wage and price setting will be increas -
ingly geared to the higher inflation rates. Infla -
tion may therefore come down more slowly 
than previously expected.
Securities markets
Bond market
At €128.3 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in April was significantly down on 
the previous month’s level (€188.6 billion). 
After deducting redemptions and taking ac -
count of changes in issuers’ holdings of their 
own debt securities, the outstanding volume of 
domestic bonds fell by €4.0 billion on balance. 
€12.7 billion worth of foreign debt securities 
were issued on the German market. Overall, 
the outstanding volume of debt securities in 
Germany therefore rose by €8.7 billion in April.
In April, domestic enterprises redeemed debt 
securities worth €3.2 billion net, compared with €1.7 billion one month earlier. On bal -
ance, these redemptions were entirely attribut -
able to debt securities issued by other financial 
institutions (-€3.3 billion).
In the reporting month, domestic credit institu -
tions redeemed debt securities worth €1.3 bil -
lion on balance, after having issued debt secur -
ities for €22.8 billion in March. Ultimately, this 
was solely attributable to specialised credit in -
stitutions, which reduced their capital market 
debt by €3.1 billion. By contrast, mortgage 
Pfandbriefe and other bank debt securities that 
can be structured flexibly were issued to the 
tune of €1.3 billion and €0.5 billion net, re -
spectively.
In April, the public sector issued bonds totalling 
€0.5 billion net, compared with €18.9 billion in 
the previous month. On balance, only central 
government increased its capital market debt, 
by €7.5 billion. It mainly issued Federal bonds 
(Bunds) with maturities of 30, 15 and seven 
years (totalling €13 billion), two- year Treasury 
notes (Schätze; €6.3 billion) and Treasury dis -
count paper (Bubills; €3.1 billion). This con -
trasted with net redemptions of five- year Fed -
eral notes (Bobls) amounting to €9.5 billion. 
State and local governments redeemed debt 
securities with a net value of €7.0 billion.
Domestic non- banks were the only net buyers 
in the month under review, acquiring bonds for 
a net €26.8 billion. Foreign investors and Ger -
man credit institutions sold debt securities 
worth €4.1 billion and €0.7 billion net, respect -
ively. Holdings of bonds in the Bundesbank’s 
portfolio decreased by €13.3 billion net. This 
was mainly because – from March 2023 – prin -
cipal payments on securities purchased under 
the asset purchase programme were no longer 
fully reinvested.Uncertainty

Equity market
In April, domestic enterprises raised new funds 
in the German equity market totalling €2.6 bil -
lion on balance, following €1.7 billion in March. 
The outstanding volume of foreign equities in 
the German market rose by €2.4 billion over 
the same period. In net terms, domestic credit 
institutions and non- banks were the main 
buyers of shares (€3.2 billion and €3.1 billion, 
respectively). While credit institutions primarily 
bought foreign securities, non- banks only pur -
chased German equities on balance. Non-  
resident investors decreased their equity expos -
ure in Germany by €1.4 billion net.
Mutual funds
Domestic mutual funds recorded only weak in -
flows again (€1.1 billion in the reporting month, 
compared with €2.2 billion in March). On bal -
ance, specialised funds reserved for institu -
tional investors were the chief recipients of the 
fresh funds (€0.8 billion). Among the various 
asset classes, new shares were placed on the 
market primarily by mixed securities funds (€1.2 
billion) and open- end real estate funds (€0.7 
billion). By contrast, equity and bond funds re -
corded slight outflows of funds (-€0.3 billion 
and -€0.2 billion, respectively). The outstanding 
volume of foreign mutual fund shares distrib -
uted in the German market rose by €3.0 billion 
in April. Domestic non- banks proved to be the 
only net buyers (€4.3 billion). Domestic credit 
institutions reduced their fund portfolios only 
slightly (-€0.3 billion), while foreign investors 
were only marginally active in the German mar -
ket.
German balance of payments 
in April 2023
In April 2023, Germany’s current account re -
corded a surplus of €21.8 billion, down €8.7 
billion on the previous month’s level. This was 
mainly attributable to a smaller goods account surplus. The surplus in invisible current transac -
tions, which comprise services as well as pri -
mary and secondary income, remained practic -
ally unchanged.
In April, the surplus in the goods account fell 
by €8.9 billion to €16.1 billion because receipts 
recorded a sharper decline than expenditure.
At €5.6 billion, the surplus in invisible current 
transactions remained at roughly the same 
level as the previous month. The deficit in sec -
ondary income declined by €2.6 billion to €5.4 
billion in April; this was mainly due to the coun -
termovement to the Bundesbank’s net monet -
ary income transfer to the Eurosystem pool in 
March. However, net receipts in primary in -
come narrowed by almost the same amount 
(€2.3 billion) to €14.3 billion. The decline was 
driven in particular by higher dividend pay -
ments to non-  residents for portfolio invest -
ment. In addition, the deficit in the services ac -Net issuance of

count was somewhat larger at €3.2 billion. 
Here, total revenue fell slightly more sharply 
than expenditure, with a decrease in transac -
tions in the area of other business- related ser -
vices putting considerable downward pressure 
on both sides of the balance sheet.
In April, the uncertainty that had temporarily 
built up in the financial markets as a result of 
the US banking crisis receded to a large extent. 
Germany’s cross- border portfolio investment 
recorded net capital exports of €23.2 billion 
(after net capital imports of €20.4 billion in 
March). Resident investors increased their hold -
ings of foreign securities by €17.8 billion. They 
purchased mainly debt securities (€12.7 billion), 
channelling €7.8 billion into bonds and €4.9 
billion into money market paper. In addition, 
they purchased mutual fund shares (€3.0 bil -
lion) and shares (€2.1 billion) from abroad.
Foreign investors sold German securities (€5.5 
billion), mainly parting with money market 
paper (€3.8 billion) on balance. However, they 
also offloaded shares (€1.4 billion) and bonds 
(€0.3 billion).
In April, transactions in financial derivatives 
registered outflows of €5.3 billion (March: out -
flows of €2.7 billion).
Direct investment recorded net capital exports 
of €8.3 billion in April, compared with €14.9 
billion in March. German enterprises increased 
their foreign direct investment stocks by €9.5 
billion. They provided affiliated enterprises with 
additional equity capital (€9.3 billion), largely 
through reinvested earnings. They also granted 
a small volume of additional intra- group loans 
(€0.1 billion), with the increase in trade credits 
and the decrease in financial loans striking a 
more or less even balance. Foreign enterprises 
boosted their direct investment by €1.2 billion, 
augmenting German enterprises’ equity capital 
by €2.2 billion. However, they reduced the vol -

Arduous recovery amid high and only 
 gradually easing inflation – outlook for the 
German economy up to 2025
Over the projection horizon, the German economy is set to recover only arduously from the cri -
ses of the past three years. In particular, it is still struggling with the consequences of high infla -
tion, though this is, at least, easing. As a result, and on the back of strongly rising wages as well 
as a robust labour market, households’ real income and their consumption expenditure recover 
gradually. Real government consumption declines sharply this year due to pandemic-related 
expenditure petering out, and then rises significantly again. The higher financing costs brought 
about by tighter monetary policy are, however, dampening private investment, especially in hous -
ing construction. In addition, the stronger euro and the high wage dynamics constitute a head -
wind for exporters. Thanks to rising foreign demand, exports are still increasing moderately. Over -
all, the economy only slowly regains its footing in the current year, and grows somewhat more 
strongly over the remainder of the projection period.
Owing to the sluggish start at the turn of the year, real gross domestic product (GDP) falls on 
average in 2023, by 0.3% in calendar- adjusted terms. The German economy then grows by 1.2% 
in 2024 and by 1.3% in 2025. Compared with the December projection, the GDP growth rate for 
2023 has been revised upwards slightly, mainly because the situation on the energy markets 
eased. For 2024 and 2025, on the other hand, it has been revised downwards. This is due, first 
and foremost, to higher interest rates and decreased competitiveness.
The inflation rate as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) falls from 
8.7% last year to 6.0% in 2023. In the years 2024 and 2025, it decreases further, to 3.1% and 
2.7%. First of all, energy price inflation, in particular, is receding strongly. On the other hand, core 
inflation (i.e. excluding energy and food) is proving to be more persistent than previously antici -
pated. It only peaks in the current year, at 5.2%. This is because labour costs are climbing strongly, 
profit margins are turning out higher again, and increased energy costs are being passed through 
to the prices of other goods with a lag. As from 2024, the latter effects gradually peter out, and 
profit margins normalise somewhat. However, the high price pressure exerted by labour costs 
only eases noticeably by 2025. Overall, core inflation falls to 3.1% in 2024 and 2.8% in 2025. 
Compared with the December projection, the headline inflation rate was revised downwards due 
to energy, especially in 2023 and 2024. Core inflation is consistently higher.
The general government deficit ratio falls slightly to 2.4% in 2023 and significantly to 1.2% in 
2024; in 2025, it remains virtually unchanged. Coronavirus measures are largely being eliminated 
in 2023. At the same time, the volume of support measures related to the energy crisis and high 
inflation is still rising slightly. This volume decreases strongly in 2024 before these measures fall 
away in 2025. The debt ratio falls to 62% in 2025.
With regard to inflation, risks are tilted to the upside. High inflation could become more entrenched 
if wages and profits rise even more strongly. A pass- through of this kind is possible in an environ -
ment of high aggregate demand. This underscores the importance of decisive monetary policy 
action in counteracting more persistent inflation and the economic and societal risks it entails.Deutsche Bundesbank

Economic outlook1
The German economy contracted in the last 
winter half- year (Q4 2022 and Q1 2023) by al -
most 1%, i.e. to the extent expected in the De -
cember 2022 projection.2 This put it in a tech -
nical recession, which is said to occur when 
real GDP declines in two consecutive quarters 
in seasonally adjusted terms.3 Under the influ -
ence of inflation fuelled by high energy prices, 
private consumption fell sharply. Meanwhile, 
decreased foreign demand depressed exports. 
Furthermore, government consumption fell 
substantially. For example, pandemic- related 
public healthcare expenditure on measures such as testing and vaccination no longer took 
place. The decline in both private as well as 
government consumption was even steeper 
than expected in December. In return, invest -
ment held up better than anticipated and ex -
panded somewhat despite the rise in financing 
costs. The unexpectedly mild weather condi -
tions bolstered housing construction. Business 
investment benefited from a faster than ex -
pected easing in the energy markets and a 
more significant easing in supply bottlenecks 
for intermediate goods. Industry, which had ex -
perienced surprisingly positive output overall in 
the winter half- year, also benefited from this.
Economic output is likely to rise again slightly in 
the current quarter. According to the ifo Insti -
tute, enterprises’ assessment of the business 
situation was more positive than in the preced -
ing quarter, particularly in the services sector. 
The Bundesbank’s weekly activity index (WAI) 
also shows an upward trend.4 Private consump -
tion should bottom out as, thanks to steeply in -
creasing wages, households’ real disposable in -
come is stabilising in spite of what is still a very 
high inflation rate. This helps service providers, 
which are likely to significantly expand their 
overall activity. The rather positive results of 
S&P Global’s purchasing managers’ survey also 
give indications of this. Industry is likely to 
largely withstand the still- ongoing decline in 
demand. Fallen energy prices are having some -
thing of an easing effect, the order books are 
still very well stocked, and supply bottlenecks 
are likely to continue diminishing.5 This will also German econ -

support exports. In the construction sector, by 
contrast, a decline in output is to be expected.
Over the remainder of the projection horizon, 
the German economy is still struggling with the 
consequences of very high inflation, in particu -
lar. However, inflation is continuing to decline – 
first and foremost as a result of weaker energy 
inflation. As wages see ongoing strong growth 
thanks to a robust labour market, households’ 
real income situation will improve, and their 
consumption expenditure will expand mark -
edly. The lower market prices for gas and elec -
tricity will also ease the burden on firms’ en -
ergy costs. However, high wage growth means 
that firms will see a steep rise in labour costs. 
Additionally, the euro has appreciated as a re -
sult of tighter monetary policy in the euro area. 
As foreign demand is rising and supply bottle -
necks will likely have eased for the most part by 
the end of the year, exports will see moderate 
growth nonetheless. Higher financing costs will 
still represent a drag on private investment, 
which will carry on dwindling until next year in 
the case of housing construction. By contrast, 
real government investment is expected to rise 
steeply throughout the projection horizon, par -
ticularly for military equipment. Furthermore, 
following a setback this year, real government 
expenditure will again increase substantially in 
subsequent years. Overall, the expansion of 
economic activity is likely to increase only grad -
ually in the second half of the year. The econ -
omy will then see somewhat stronger growth 
over the remainder of the projection horizon.
This means that the German economy is re -
covering only arduously from the crises of the 
past three years. Owing to a sluggish start due 
to a decline in the past winter half- year, eco -
nomic output will contract in the middle of the 
current year, too. In calendar- adjusted terms, 
real GDP will decrease by 0.3%. It will then 
grow by 1.2% in 2024 and by 1.3% in 2025. 
The annual average GDP rate has thus been re -
vised upwards slightly compared with the De -
cember 2023 projection, mainly due to the 
more relaxed situation in the energy markets. By contrast, GDP growth is projected to be sig -
nificantly weaker for 2024 and slightly weaker 
for 2025, reflecting mainly higher interest rates 
and exporters’ reduced price competitiveness.
Economic output will not come close to return -
ing to potential until the end of the projection 
horizon. However, the fact that there is a nega -
tive output gap over the entire projection hori -
zon is not due to a lack of demand. Rather, se -
vere supply disruptions in the recent past will 
continue to weigh on the real economy for a 
longer period of time – also via price and wage 
costs. However, only a portion of these devel -
opments are deemed permanent. This means In particular, the

CONFIDENTIAL !that their impact on GDP is only partly reflected 
in lower potential output, as the Bundesbank’s 
concept of potential output is based on sus -
tainable economic performance on the supply 
side. Nevertheless, the estimate of the German 
economy’s potential output over the projection 
horizon had already been revised downwards – 
at first only moderately, in December 2021, due 
to pandemic effects, and most recently, sub -
stantially in December 2022 on account of Rus -
sia’s war on Ukraine.6 As a result, the energy 
supply in Germany deteriorated sustainably, 
with the result that energy will remain more ex -
pensive in the future. From a structural point of 
view, the aggregate supply side has not changed significantly further in comparison 
with the December projection.7 In the current 
projection, then, the estimated growth rate of 
potential output has hardly been adjusted, 
amounting to +0.6% this year, +0.4% in 2024 
and +0.6% in 2025.
Economic activity in detail
Private consumption suffered from high infla -
tion in the past winter half- year. Real dispos -
able income declined sharply, and households 
reduced their price-  adjusted consumption ex -
penditure to an even greater degree than ex -
pected in the December projection. At the 
same time, they only slightly offset the surge in 
inflation by saving less. Private consumption 
will probably rise again slightly in the current 
quarter: in spite of continued high inflation, 
households’ income situation is set to stabilise 
due to steeply rising wages and robust labour 
market conditions (see the chart on p. 21). This 
is consistent with the fact that, according to 
the GfK survey, the previously very poor con -
sumer sentiment has already improved mark -
edly and the propensity to save has decreased 
slightly. The saving ratio is thus likely to con -
tinue declining somewhat. This is also assumed 
for the remainder of the projection horizon, be -
cause precautionary motives will probably lose 
significance as inflation eases and uncertainty is 
lessened. However, strong catch- up effects in 
consumption that was financed by the savings 
involuntarily built up during the pandemic are Private con -

Underlying conditions for macroeconomic projections
This projection is based on assumptions by 
Eurosystem experts about the global econ-
omy, exchange rates, commodity prices and 
interest rates. These were made on the 
basis of information available as at 23 May 
2023. The assumptions regarding economic 
activity in the euro area are derived from 
projections compiled by the national central 
banks of the euro area countries.1 These 
projections incorporate fi  scal measures as 
soon as they are adequately specifi  ed and 
are deemed likely to be implemented.
Slight pick- up in global economic growth
To be sure, the global economy slowed 
down less signifi  cantly in the fi  nal quarter of 
2022 than expected in the December pro-
jection and started 2023 on a sound foot-
ing. However, stubbornly high infl  ation in 
many countries and tighter monetary policy 
continue to weigh on economic activity, es-
pecially in the advanced economies where 
the outlook has been revised downward 
somewhat. More restrictive credit supply 
conditions in the United States, also in con-
nection with the recent banking turmoil, 
are likely to dampen economic growth 
there. In China, by contrast, the discontinu-
ation of the zero- COVID policy has spurred 
demand. Overall, global economic activity 
over the projection horizon looks set to de-
velop at a similar pace to that assumed in 
December. On an annual average, the 
global economy excluding the euro area is 
expected to grow by 3.1% both this year 
and in 2024. A somewhat higher growth 
rate of 3.3% is anticipated for 2025. Inter-
national trade (excluding the euro area) 
contracted in the fourth quarter of 2022, 
bringing the average annual growth rate 
projected for 2023 down to 1.3%, consid-
erably weaker than assumed in the Decem-
ber projection. However, growth is then set to pick up again, with a rate of 3.4% antici-
pated for both 2024 and 2025, broadly in 
line with the December projection.
High infl  ation rates in the euro area 
continue to dampen purchasing power
Economic activity in the euro area slipped 
slightly in both the fourth quarter of 2022 
and the fi  rst quarter of 2023.2 Uncertainty 
regarding energy supply and other supply 
bottlenecks, which had affected manufac-
turing and construction in particular, has 
decreased. However, persistently high infl  a-
tion continues to weigh on households’ 
purchasing power, despite energy prices 
having now fallen considerably. While gov-
ernment measures have eased some of the 
strain stemming from energy expenditure, 
infl  ation is now broadly based and there-
fore very high for other goods as well. At 
the same time, given the progressive mon-
etary policy tightening, the cost of credit- 
fi  nanced expenditure for fi  rms and house-
holds has gone up.3 The situation on the la-
bour market remains robust and underpins 
the macroeconomic outlook. Thanks to de-
clining infl  ation, decreasing uncertainty re-
garding the supply and cost of energy as 
1 The projections by the national central banks of the 
euro area countries were completed on 31 May 2023.
2 Compared with the fl  ash estimate for the fi  rst quar-
ter of 2023, Eurostat revised the quarterly rate of euro 
area price and seasonally adjusted GDP downward by 
0.2 percentage point to -0.1%. Excluding the strong 
downward revision of the Irish GDP rate by 1.9 per-
centage points to -4.6%, however, euro area GDP 
would have picked up slightly, by 0.1%. When the de-
tailed results were published by the Federal Statistical 
Offi   ce on 25 May 2023, German GDP growth, too, 
was projected to be weaker, at -0.3%, than in the fl  ash 
estimate, in which stagnation had been expected in 
the fi  rst quarter.
3 Taken in isolation, credit supply conditions that are 
more restrictive than those to be expected as a result 
of rising interest rates are assumed to have only a 
limited effect on euro area economic growth and to 
hardly impact the outlook for infl  ation at all.Deutsche Bundesbank

well as robust developments on exporters’ 
sales markets, the euro area economy is 
again set to record more signifi  cant growth 
over the projection horizon, despite higher 
interest rates. For the euro area (excluding 
Germany), economic growth of 1.4% is ex-
pected for the current year, which is well 
above the December projection. With 
growth rates of 1.7% in 2024 and 1.8% in 
2025, economic activity is then assumed to 
expand by somewhat less than estimated in 
the December projection.
German exporters’ sales markets are likely 
to see slightly slower growth than world 
trade over the projection horizon. This is 
because import growth in the advanced 
economies, which are home to a large pro-
portion of German export markets, is lag-
ging somewhat behind global trade dynam-
ics overall.Technical assumptions of the projection
Energy commodity prices have declined in 
recent months and thus remained lower 
than assumed in the December projection. 
Although forward quotations from that 
time indicated that natural gas prices would 
increase in the fi  rst quarter of 2023, this did 
not come to pass. European gas consumers’ 
efforts to save energy, mild winter tempera-
tures and high imports of liquefi  ed natural 
gas contributed to well- fi  lled gas storage 
facilities and helped ease gas prices in Euro-
pean wholesale trade. Against this back-
drop, European electricity prices, which are 
closely linked to gas prices, have also fallen 
considerably since the winter. Forward 
quotations indicate that, as of the 2023-24 
winter half- year, European gas prices may 
again be somewhat higher than their cur-
rent level and then decline slightly once 
more after the 2024-25 winter half- year. 
For the European electricity markets, fu-
tures show higher prices for the winter 
months in both years up to the end of the 
projection horizon.
Uncertain demand prospects and persist-
ently high exports of Russian crude oil to 
non- sanctioning countries contributed to 
the decline in prices on the global crude oil 
markets. At the same time, OPEC’s an-
nouncement of a signifi  cant production 
cut- back as of May propped up prices. Mar-
ket quotations suggest that crude oil prices 
will continue their decline over the next two 
years. Overall, the assumptions for energy 
commodity prices therefore remain well 
below those contained in the December 
projection. Prices for other commodities are 
also expected to decline further initially, be-
fore rising slightly in 2025 on an annual 
average.
Agricultural producer prices in the euro area 
slipped somewhat in recent months from 
the peak reached last winter. This is likely Oil, natural gas and electricity prices

also due to declining energy prices, which 
had an impact on fertiliser prices, amongst 
other things. Forward quotations suggest 
that producer prices for food will initially 
continue to fall slightly before then holding 
steady in 2024 and 2025 at a level some-
what below the assumptions contained in 
the December projection.
In December 2022, February 2023 and 
March 2023, the ECB Governing Council 
decided to raise the key interest rates by an-
other 50 basis points at each of those meet-
ings. These decisions were motivated by the 
fact that infl  ation is signifi  cantly too high 
and, according to both the December pro-
jection and the projection compiled by ECB 
staff in March, is likely to remain above the 
euro area target of 2% for too long. At its 
meeting in May 2023, the ECB Governing 
Council raised the key interest rates again, 
albeit by only 25 basis points. Furthermore, 
the Eurosystem began gradually reducing 
its asset purchase programme (APP) port-
folio at the start of March 2023. Future de-
cisions by the ECB Governing Council are 
expected to ensure that key interest rates 
will be raised to levels suffi   ciently restrictive 
to achieve a timely return of infl  ation to its 
medium- term target. Key interest rate deci-
sions will continue to be “data dependent”. 
In the money market, interest rates have 
gone up signifi  cantly in recent months. 
EURIBOR futures are still set to follow a 
slight upward trajectory over the coming 
months, but then to decline gradually as of 
the fourth quarter of 2023. Yields on ten- 
year Federal bonds (Bunds) were also up on 
the level reached when the December pro-
jection was fi  nalised. The yield trajectory 
derived from futures prices will remain more 
or less constant over the projection horizon. 
Similar to the EURIBOR, the yield level over 
the projection horizon will also signifi  cantly 
exceed the December projection. For bank 
loans, fi  nancing costs are also expected to 
be higher than in the December projection.Since the conclusion of the December pro-
jection, foreign exchange markets have per-
ceived the euro area’s monetary policy 
stance and outlook to be tighter than that 
of the US Federal Reserve. This pushed up 
the value of the euro, which was trading at 
US$1.09 in the period underlying the ex-
change rate assumptions and thus just 
under 6% higher than assumed in the De-
cember projection. The euro’s appreciation 
against the currencies of 41 major trading 
partners came to just over 3%.
Fiscal policy shaped by crisis- related 
fi  scal  measures
With a volume of just over 2% of GDP , tem-
porary crisis- related support measures will 
signifi  cantly increase the government defi  cit 
in 2023, too (see the chart on p. 20). How-
ever, these burdens will fall signifi  cantly on 
the year, as the coronavirus measures are Major assumptions of the projection

largely expiring. Of the aid provided in the 
wake of the energy crisis, the broadly based 
electricity and gas price brakes constitute 
the largest strains in 2023. After deducting 
the revenue drawn from sales on the elec-
tricity market, the impact of these strains on 
the defi  cit will amount to just over 1% of 
GDP in 2023. In addition, the Economic Sta-
bilisation Fund for Energy Assistance is dis-
bursing supplementary assistance. The fact 
that many employers are paying employees 
part of their wages and salaries as infl  ation 
compensation bonuses that are exempt 
from tax and social contributions is damp-
ening government revenue. Furthermore, 
VAT on natural gas and district heating will 
continue to be charged at a reduced rate 
up to the end of the fi  rst quarter of 2024. 
The impact of the crisis measures on defi  cits 
can still only be projected with a high de-
gree of uncertainty. Lower gas and electri-
city prices have now pushed down the esti-
mated fi  scal costs of the energy price brakes signifi  cantly below those contained in the 
December 2022 projection. Moreover, no 
further assistance is planned for gas trading 
companies.
In 2024, transfers under the electricity and 
gas price brake will fall sharply in annual 
terms. In this projection (as in the Federal 
Government’s plans), they will continue 
until the end of April 2024.4 Due to lower 
energy prices, however, the costs will only 
be minor. Bonuses exempt from tax and so-
cial contributions will continue to lead to 
higher revenue losses.
The projection also includes fi  scal policy 
measures that will affect the government 
budget on balance in the longer term. On 
the revenue side, income tax cuts are be-
ginning to take effect. In particular, the tax 
scale shifts from year to year in order to 
compensate for bracket creep in the previ-
ous year.5 Contribution rates for the social 
security funds are rising signifi  cantly: the 
general contribution rate to the long- term 
care insurance scheme will increase by 
0.35 percentage point as at 1 July 2023 as 
a result of the reform of long- term care. 
The supplementary contribution rates to 
the health insurance scheme will be raised 
considerably, especially as of 2024. On the 
expenditure side, investment in military ma-
chinery and equipment and spending on cli-
mate change mitigation are increasing 
sharply, based on projects under the Federal 
Armed Forces Special Fund and the Climate 
and Transformation Fund. Moreover, the 
latest wage agreements for central and 
local government signifi  cantly infl  ate per-
sonnel expenditure.
4 So far, these price brakes can be applied until the 
end of 2023. However, current legislation allows them 
to be extended by means of regulations until the end 
of April 2024.
5 The shifts up to 2024 have already been adopted. 
The projection assumes that legislation will be passed 
in order to continue this practice in 2025, too.Temporary fiscal measures affecting

no longer assumed.8 As from the third quarter, 
steeply increasing wages amid diminishing in -
flation will lead to perceptible gains in purchas -
ing power. Private consumption will thus re -
cover markedly, a development that will be -
come particularly apparent in 2024. In 2025, 
however, it will lose momentum. At that point, 
wages will no longer be seeing such strong 
growth, and employment will have stopped ex -
panding owing to demographic factors.
Exports fell somewhat more sharply in the 
fourth quarter of 2022 than expected in the 
December projection, owing to declining for -
eign demand and high energy prices. However, 
they were much more robust in the first quar -
ter of 2023. After the turn of the year, lower 
energy prices supported production in energy- 
intensive industry, and diminishing supply 
bottlenecks probably helped firms to process 
the stocks of orders on their books, which 
were, in some cases, considerable. Despite a 
further fall in foreign demand, they therefore 
offset part of the previous decline in exports. 
Lower energy prices and diminishing supply 
bottlenecks are likely to ease the burden on en -
terprises over the remainder of the year, too, as 
indicated by the results of the Bundesbank’s 
business survey.9 This should also benefit ex -
ports, which are thus likely to grow somewhat 
in the current quarter, even though foreign 
orders in industry have been trending down -
wards of late. This is also indicated by the 
slightly positive ifo export expectations. In the 
second half of the year, exports will gain some 
momentum in line with the assumed increase 
in foreign demand.10 The growing sales mar -
kets will also provide the necessary impetus for 
the remainder of the projection horizon, but 
this will not be passed through in full. Perman -
ently elevated energy prices, an appreciating 
euro under a tighter monetary policy and 
strong domestic wage pressures will have a 
lasting impact on the competitiveness of Ger -
man exporters. As a result, exports will expand 
at a substantially weaker pace than the sales 
markets.11Business investment held up better than ex -
pected in the 2022-23 winter half- year. In spite 
of higher financing costs and the initially still 
high uncertainty regarding energy supply, en -
terprises markedly increased their investment. Exports benefit

8 High inflation is likely to have depressed real private 
wealth, thereby eliminating a portion of coronavirus sav -
ings. For this reason, too, they have probably now been 
used up by lower income households, or, at the latest, will 
be used up once energy bills have to be paid this year. This 
is indicated by figures in the Bundesbank’s Distribution 
Wealth Accounts (DWA); see Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2022c). Data on the financial accounts also show that 
households have been purchasing bonds on a larger scale 
again for some time now; see Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2023b). This is probably due to shifts from very liquid 
assets to less liquid but higher- interest assets, and makes it 
less likely that households will spend the money they saved 
up during the pandemic on a larger scale as they had 
planned to do in some cases a year ago; see Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2022d).

Investment activities are also likely to have 
benefited from the easing in the energy mar -
kets. In addition, the availability of some capital 
goods improved as supply bottlenecks dimin -
ished. For the current quarter, survey results 
from the ifo Institute point to a further, but 
probably distinctly smaller, increase in business 
investment. Manufacturers of capital goods ex -
perienced a stabilisation of their business cli -
mate at a high level, according to ifo Institute 
data, and their production expectations most 
recently rose again slightly. Over the remainder 
of the projection horizon, robust export dy -
namics, expiring supply bottlenecks and the 
catch- up potential still available suggest that 
business investment will continue to increase.12 
Investment is also likely to be boosted by the 
German economy’s transition to more climate 
and environment- friendly production methods. 
At the same time, though, financing condi -
tions, which deteriorated considerably as a re -
sult of the tightening of monetary policy, are 
having a noticeable dampening effect. Overall, 
therefore, business investment is seeing only 
very muted expansion.
Housing investment rose sharply at the begin -
ning of 2023 after having contracted, in some 
cases significantly, for three consecutive quar -
ters. However, this increase, which comes as a 
surprise when compared with the December 
projection, is largely due to the relatively mild 
weather in January and February. The down -
ward trend in housing investment is therefore 
likely to have been interrupted only briefly, as 
the demand for housing construction is cur -
rently severely depressed. New orders and 
building permits continued to decline signifi -
cantly in view of higher financing and construc -
tion costs.13 In addition, residential real estate 
prices have been declining since mid- 2022. The 
projection assumes that these will stabilise over Downward

The impact of negative supply- side factors on German 
fi  rms’ business activity
For some time now, various supply- side fac-
tors have been affecting the German econ-
omy. Even before the coronavirus pan-
demic, the shortage of skilled workers had 
begun to present a signifi  cant obstacle,1 
with the labour market suffering from 
shortages for quite a while, mainly as a re-
sult of demographic change.2 Since the be-
ginning of 2021, bottlenecks in key inter-
mediate inputs have also been negatively 
impacting German fi  rms’ business activity.3 
And fi  nally, the war against Ukraine and the 
tense situation in the energy markets that it 
caused led to an unprecedented rise in en-
ergy prices. More recently, the situation 
eased and energy prices fell signifi  cantly. By 
historical standards, however, they re-
mained at an elevated level.
In order to assess the impact of these three 
negative supply- side factors – the shortage 
of skilled labour, supply chain disruptions 
and higher energy costs – on the provision 
of goods and services by German enter-
prises in the near future, the Bundesbank 
surveyed a total of 2,590 enterprises as part of the Bundesbank Online Panel Firms 
(BOP-F) in April 2023.4
For the fi  rst quarter of 2023, just over three- 
quarters of fi  rms reported that energy costs 
were higher than usual. By contrast, fewer 
than two- thirds expected costs to remain at 
a higher level than usual in the summer 
half- year (April to September 2023).
1 In 2017, for example, just under half of the fi  rms re-
sponding to a corporate survey conducted by the 
Cologne  Institute for Economic Research (Institut der 
deutschen Wirtschaft, IW) reported that the shortage 
of skilled workers was dampening their investments; 
see Bardt and Grömling (2017).
2 See Fitzenberger (2023) and Federal Employment 
Agency (2023). Labour market bottlenecks have played 
a prominent role in the Bundesbank’s macroeconomic 
projections for at least six years; see, for example, 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2017).
3 This is particularly true of fi  rms in the manufacturing 
sector. In the spring of 2022, it was foreseeable, in the 
light of the Ukraine war, that industrial production 
would be hurt by supply bottlenecks for longer than 
previously expected; see Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2022e).
4 The full questionnaire will be available from 23 June 
2023; see Deutsche Bundesbank (2023c). The relevant 
questions were asked only in April 2023 (wave 27).

In the past quarter, supply bottlenecks re-
mained a major factor for just over one- 
quarter of all fi  rms (around one- third in the 
manufacturing sector). Supply bottlenecks 
are expected to ease further in the summer 
half- year, with fewer than one in fi  ve enter-
prises still expecting a lower availability of 
intermediate inputs than usual then (just 
over one- quarter in the manufacturing sec-
tor). If the results are weighted on the basis 
of enterprises’ sales, the share is actually 
only 2% (9% in the manufacturing sector).5
The shortage of skilled workers is likely to 
remain a widespread obstacle in 2023. Al-
most half of the surveyed fi  rms stated that 
access to skilled workers was more diffi   cult 
in the past quarter, and virtually no enter-
prise said it was at a higher level than usual. 
Looking to the summer half- year, enter-
prises do not expect the situation to change 
signifi  cantly.
The three supply- side factors may have an 
impact not only through the number of 
fi  rms affected but also through their inten-
sity at these fi  rms. Those fi  rms reporting a 
deviation from the usual level for one of 
these negative factors reported a predom-
inantly negative impact on their business 
activity.6 Compared with the fi  rst quarter of 
2023, the intensity of the impact remains 
virtually unchanged in the current summer 
half- year.7 In relation to the projection, the 
survey results as a whole indicate a slight 
relief in terms of energy costs and a discern-
ible relief in terms of supply bottlenecks in 
the current summer half- year. Supply bottle-
necks are assumed to completely dissipate 
by the end of the year.
The higher than usual energy costs are cur-
rently having a noticeable dampening effect 
on German enterprises’ business activity. An 
important question is whether business ac-
tivity would not recover even if energy costs were to return to their usual level (roughly 
that of 2021). Weighted by sales, slightly 
more than half of those fi  rms for which 
higher energy costs had a negative impact 
in the fi  rst quarter of 2023 expect that their 
business activity would recover completely. 
However, 40% of fi  rms expect only a partial 
recovery and 6% expect no recovery at all.8 
The fact that so many fi  rms do not expect 
their business activity to recover fully even if 
energy costs were to return to their usual 
levels suggests that other negative factors 
are at play, which fi  rms do not expect to 
disappear if energy costs come down again. 
In addition, some of the decline in produc-
tion recorded by energy- intensive industry 
in the past year may be permanent.
5 This takes into account the fact that supply bottle-
necks are likely to have a stronger macroeconomic im-
pact where an enterprise is large than for a small en-
terprise. For each possible answer, the weights are cal-
culated as the sum of the respective enterprises’ sales 
divided by the sum of the sales of all enterprises that 
were asked the question. In the fi  rst quarter, the 
weighted share was 15% (23% in manufacturing).
6 This analysis only looked at the responses of fi  rms 
that reported a certain deviation in both of the sur-
veyed periods. Weighted by sales, the deviations in all 
factors cause 10% to 15% of fi  rms to be “very nega-
tively” impacted. In terms of supply bottlenecks and 
the shortage of skilled workers, around 85% state that 
they had been impacted “fairly negatively”. There are 
hardly any fi  rms that see no impact here. Looking at 
the higher energy costs, meanwhile, around two- thirds 
of fi  rms reported having been impacted “fairly nega-
tively”. By contrast, the higher energy costs have no 
impact on around one in fi  ve enterprises.
7 There are indications that the intensity is waning in 
relation to energy costs at best, as a small number of 
fi  rms see energy costs remaining higher than usual, yet 
do not expect this to have any further impact despite 
higher costs previously having affected them some-
what adversely.
8 In the manufacturing sector, the results are even 
clearer: only 43% of industrial fi  rms expect their busi-
ness activity to recover completely, whereas 55% ex-
pect a partial recovery at best.Deutsche Bundesbank

the course of the year and see a moderate in -
crease over the remainder of the projection 
horizon.14 In this environment, housing invest -
ment will again decline markedly from the 
second quarter of 2023 until the coming year. 
From the second half of 2024 onwards, how -
ever, it will slowly start to recover. This is be -
cause the fundamental demand for housing 
will remain intact, in part due to the high level 
of immigration. In addition, investment in 
housing stock is likely to increase in connection 
with the energy transition. Even so, the expan -
sionary path onto which housing investment 
will veer in the second half of the projection 
horizon is very flat.
Real government consumption will decline 
sharply this year and, when viewed in isolation, 
will dampen economic activity.15 The main rea -
son for this is that the pandemic- related health 
spending from previous years, such as for test -
ing and vaccination in particular, will come to 
an almost complete end. This will not be offset 
by higher expenditure on additional staff or 
refugees, for example. Real government con -
sumption will pick up again from 2024 and 
then grow somewhat more strongly than real 
GDP .
Nominal government investment will grow 
sharply over the projection horizon. However, 
there will still be large price increases here. Government

tors would suggest. Overvaluations of residential real es -
tate will therefore gradually decline over the projection 
horizon. For more information on overvaluations last year,

15 It has been announced that, in the national accounts, 
public transport enterprises will be reclassified under gen -
eral government as of the second quarter of 2023; for 
more information, see Eurostat (2022). This has not been 
taken into account for this projection, as the exact imple -
mentation of this change is yet to be determined. The rea -
son for the reclassification is that the €49 Deutschland-  
Ticket will significantly increase the need for government 
subsidies. This means that transport enterprises will no 
longer obtain sufficient funding from market revenues in 
order to be classified as part of the corporate sector. This 
reclassification is likely to increase real government con -
sumption, amongst other things, as transport services that 
were previously attributed to the private sector will then be 
attributed to general government. For GDP as a whole, 
however, the reclassification should not play any major 
role.Deutsche Bundesbank

These will dampen real growth. Despite this, 
real government investment will also rise con -
siderably. This is due, in particular, to increasing 
investment in military equipment. Government 
investment in construction will also rise, how -
ever.
Real imports fell sharply in the past winter half- 
year. Lower energy imports also played a role in 
this regard. Over the remainder of this year, 
however, import demand will gradually pick up 
again. In particular, rising exports and recover -
ing private consumption will be accompanied 
by increased demand for imports. As energy 
markets ease, and due to the lower prices, en -
ergy imports are set to go back up. Overall, 
however, the decline in the past winter half-  
year will mean that import growth will only be 
low on average over 2023. Over the remainder 
of the projection horizon, imports will see fairly 
sharp expansion in line with aggregate de -
mand.According to the projection, the German cur -
rent account surplus will rise to 6.4% of GDP 
this year, compared with only 4.3% in 2022. 
The key factor is the considerable rise in the 
trade balance. This is reflected in the terms of 
trade, which improved markedly in favour of 
the German economy again as the prices of en -
ergy and other imported commodities eased. 
In light of the assumption that commodity 
prices will fall slightly and export prices will rise 
sharply at the same time, this trend will con -
tinue over the projection horizon, but will 
greatly diminish. By contrast, real trade flows of 
goods and services will tend to have a damp -
ening effect over the projection horizon. This is 
because the competitiveness of German ex -
porters will be constrained by higher energy 
prices and sharper rises in wage costs com -
pared to those of their competitors.16 This will 
dampen exports, whilst import demand from 
domestic consumption will see comparatively 
strong growth. On the whole, no major 
changes in the trade balance are expected for 
2024 or 2025. The current account surplus, 
too, will see hardly any change over the projec -
tion horizon, remaining consistently at just over 
6%.
Labour market
Despite the decline in economic output in the 
2022-23 winter half- year, there was a marked 
increase in employment during this period. The 
December projection expected that employ -
ment would only stagnate. However, the total 
number of hours worked grew to a lesser ex -
tent. This was related, first, to the fact that 
low- paid part- time employment rose particu -
larly sharply; this type of employment gener -
ates fewer additional hours worked. Second, 
the number of working hours per employed 
person dropped to a very low level in the fourth Government

quarter of 2022 and only partially recovered in 
the first quarter of 2023. This was attributable 
to exceptionally high levels of sick leave.17 Due 
to the weak economic activity, there was an in -
crease in the number of registered unemployed 
persons, although this was only small and less 
than had been expected in December. Demand 
for labour eased somewhat. In this context, the 
high number of vacancies decreased slightly 
over the past half- year. The pronounced labour 
market tightness, measured by the ratio of va -
cancies to unemployed persons, abated only 
moderately, and the shortage of skilled workers 
remained a widespread problem (see the box 
on pp. 24 ff.).
Immigration reached a new high in 2022 at 
1.45 million persons in net terms. The vast ma -
jority of these arrivals were refugees to Ger -
many. Immigration can, in principle, help to 
stabilise the decline in the labour force caused 
by demographic change. However, in the case 
of refugees, such as those from Ukraine, inte -
gration into the labour market is cost- intensive 
and time- consuming. For this projection, it is 
assumed that there will be no repeat of the 
high level of immigration from Ukraine over the 
past year, but that there will also be no massive 
emigration back. Compared with the Decem -
ber 2022 projection, assumed net immigration 
for the current year has been revised upwards 
by 100,000 persons to 450,000. In subsequent 
years, immigration will decline slightly but re -
main high.18 Nevertheless, and despite increas -
ing individual propensity to work, the labour 
supply will begin to decline during the course 
of 2025. This is because the dampening effects 
of demographic change will also no longer be 
able to be offset by net immigration.
Given the only sluggish economic recovery, the 
pace of employment growth is likely to slow 
markedly in the current summer half- year. This 
is also indicated by the less expansionary hiring 
intentions amongst enterprises. By contrast, 
the depressed working hours amongst em -
ployed persons should continue to recover 
gradually. A moderate rise in unemployment is also expected over the coming months. How -
ever, a particular role will be played here by the 
fact that refugees who arrived in Germany over  Very high immi -

the past year will then be increasingly available 
to the labour market.19
The underlying trend of the labour market, 
however, will remain in good shape over the 
remainder of the projection horizon. Demand 
for labour will remain high and the supply of la -
bour will, assuming there is no one- off effect 
of additional refugees from Ukraine, grow only 
slightly over time. This means that the number 
of registered unemployed persons will also 
start to decline again towards the end of the 
current year, especially as the economic recov -
ery will increasingly gain momentum. At the 
same time, labour market tightness will in -
crease again and it is likely that it will again be -
come more difficult to fill vacancies. Employ -
ment will rise only slightly in 2024, while the 
unemployment rate will return to its level of 
2022. On average over 2025, employment will 
not yet begin to decline on the year, despite a 
diminishing labour force. This is because un -
employment will continue to fall somewhat 
further. The ratio will then return almost to its 
previous record low from 2019.
Labour costs and prices
The most recent wage agreements exceeded 
the strong rises in wages that were agreed upon last year. They were also well above the 
expectations of the December projection. For 
example, when calculated on a yearly basis, 
wage growth amounted to 6.3% for the public 
sector (central and local government), 6.1% for 
Deutsche Post, and 5.1% for the textiles and 
clothing industry.20 In some sectors, the unions 
achieved a considerably higher percentage of 
their demands than on average over previous 
years. This is likely to be a result of the conflu -
ence of high inflation, a robust and structurally 
tight labour market, and diminishing risks to 
economic activity. Similar underlying conditions 
are likely to continue to prevail in the coming 
months, too. Inflation rates will decline consid -
erably over the remainder of the projection 
horizon. At the same time, however, the labour 
market will become tighter. This is conducive to 
employees’ bargaining positions and their ef -
forts to obtain greater compensation for previ -
ously suffered losses in real wages.
Most of the recent wage agreements provide 
for a mix of permanent rises in scheduled pay 
rates and inflation compensation bonuses that 
are not subject to tax or social security contri -
butions. In some sectors, these permanent pay 
rises will only take effect with a significant time 
lag, while the inflation compensation bonuses 
will be paid out primarily this year. Overall, ne -
gotiated wages will rise by 4.7% in 2023 and 
by just a slightly lower rate of 4.5% in 2024. As 
of 2025, any inflation compensation bonuses 
will again be subject to tax and social security 
contributions. It can be assumed that they will 
then be substituted by permanent wage in -… but labour

Projection
19 The influx of refugees has not had a major impact on 
the unemployment statistics over the past six months. 
These individuals are not included in the unemployment 
statistics while they are attending language and integration 
courses, even if they are recorded as seeking employment, 
as they are unavailable to the labour market during this 
time. In the coming months, some of these individuals will 
be likely to complete these courses and then become vis -
ible in the unemployment statistics.
20 These calculations always refer to a notional recipient of 
the agreed basic pay rate. Due to the fixed amounts of in -
flation compensation bonuses, wage increases are higher 
for lower pay grades and lower for higher pay grades. This 
applies similarly to cases in which base amounts have been 
agreed upon.Deutsche Bundesbank

creases in some cases. Nevertheless, the in -
crease in negotiated wages will be markedly 
lower than in the two years prior.21
Growth of actual earnings will consistently out -
pace that of negotiated wages over the projec -
tion horizon. This year, roles will be played in 
this regard by widespread inflation compensa -
tion bonuses in sectors that are not bound by 
collective agreements, delayed adjustments in 
wages to the strong rise in the minimum wage 
as of October 2022, and larger performance 
bonuses. In subsequent years, wage drift will 
be somewhat lower, but remain clearly posi -
tive. This is because, in an environment of in -
creased labour market shortages and recover -
ing economic activity, paid overtime and bene -
fits outside of the agreed pay scales will be in -
creasingly prevalent. At 6% this year and 5.2% 
next year, actual earnings will rise at their fast -
est rates since 1992. In 2025, wage growth will 
wane significantly but remain well above aver -
age. This strong wage growth will compensate 
for a large proportion of earlier losses in pur -
chasing power. However, real actual earnings 
in 2025 will still be markedly below their level 
from 2019. The real wage losses incurred since 
then will thus not have been fully recouped.22 
From a corporate perspective, the sharp rise in 
wages will also cause a considerable increase in 
labour costs. Measured in terms of compensa -
tion per employee, labour costs will rise only 
slightly less than actual earnings in 2023. In 
2024 and 2025, labour costs will actually rise 
slightly more than actual earnings. This is due 
to the assumed increases in the contribution 
rates for the statutory health insurance and 
long- term care insurance schemes.
The combination of sharply rising labour costs, 
a robust labour market, and declining eco -
nomic output will lead to an exceptionally 
strong rise in unit labour costs this year. This 
will contribute to substantial domestic infla -
tion, which, as measured by the GDP deflator, 
is expected to amount to 6%. Another factor in 
this is that enterprises are initially likely to 
widen their profit margins slightly once again, after already expanding them to a large extent 
earlier. This will lead to sharp rises in profits and 
additional price pressures.23 This is because de -
mand will be high, which is apparent from the 
large number of orders on hand in industry, for 
instance. At the same time, there will still be 
some supply- side bottlenecks for intermediate 
goods at first, which will continue to encour -
age costs to be passed through to sales prices 
to a greater degree than usual.24 This is partly 
due to the fact that the persisting high- inflation 
environment makes it more difficult for con -Actual earnings

Projection
21 All past pay agreements included in the Bundesbank’s 
negotiated wage statistics (around 500 collective wage 
agreements and provisions governing civil servant pay) are 
factored into the projections of negotiated wage increases. 
They are extrapolated beyond their contractual terms, tak -
ing into account the overall economic situation and 
industry- specific idiosyncrasies.
22 Real actual earnings are calculated as nominal actual 
earnings deflated by the HICP on a monthly basis.
23 Aggregate profit margins are defined here as the ratio 
of the gross value added deflator to unit labour costs and 
are calculated on the basis of data from the national ac -
counts. They rose sharply by 2.1% in 2021 and 2.4% in 
2022, after falling by 1.1% in 2020. They are linked to unit 
profits (defined as the ratio of gross operating surplus to 
real GDP and also calculated on the basis of data from the 
national accounts) via unit labour costs and thus the wage 
share. The more the rise in unit profits exceeds the rise in 
unit labour costs, the greater the rise in profit margins. 
Conversely, profit margins decrease if unit labour costs rise 
more sharply than unit profits. It is thus even possible for 
unit profits to rise while profit margins remain stagnant. 
This occurs when unit profits and unit labour costs increase 
at the same rate.

sumers to correctly assess price signals and 
evade price increases.
Although profit margins are likely to rise again 
slightly on average over 2023, they should start 
to normalise during the course of this year. Ul -
timately, supply bottlenecks will gradually ease 
and the pent-  up demand will abate. Accord -
ingly, enterprises’ pricing power will diminish 
again. This will likely continue over the remain -
der of the projection horizon. At the same 
time, unit labour costs will continue to rise 
sharply. However, their growth in 2024 and 
2025 will be lower than before, as productivity 
will increase perceptibly and wage growth will 
slow. Unit profits will thus be somewhat sub -
dued and will make a significantly smaller con -
tribution to domestic inflation.25 Overall, the 
rate of the GDP deflator will gradually decline 
to 2.8% in 2025. For Germany, this is still an 
unusually high level of domestic inflation by 
historical standards.
Overall, HICP inflation fell significantly more 
sharply than expected in the winter half- year. 
Following record double- digit figures of more 
than 11% in the autumn of 2022, it fell back to 
6.3% in May 2023. In the December projec -
tion, it had been forecast only to abate to 7.4% 
in May. The lower figure is mainly attributable 
to the easing in the energy markets.26 It was to be expected that energy price inflation would 
greatly diminish as a result of government relief 
measures, and this did, in fact, turn out to be 
the case. However, energy commodity prices 
– especially market prices for gas and electri -
city  – also fell much more sharply than ex -
pected. Furthermore, it is likely that these lower 
prices were passed through to end consumers 
somewhat more quickly than usual. Food price 
inflation, by contrast, continued to rise. The 
strong and broad- based rise in prices observed 
here since last year continued for longer than 
expected. Unfavourable weather conditions in 
some producer countries amplified upward 
pressures at the beginning of this year. Finally, 
the core rate (excluding energy and food) has 
remained surprisingly high since the previous 
projection was finalised. This applies to infla -
tion in the prices of both goods and services, 
thus revealing a stronger price trend for under -
lying inflation than had been expected in De -
cember.
According to the projection, annual energy in -
flation will continue to decline this year and will 
be negative for a period of time in the autumn. 
Oil prices, for instance, are projected to fall 
somewhat further. In addition, consumer rates 
for electricity and gas are likely to decrease 
slightly over the course of the year. There are 
also signs that food price inflation will no 
longer be as broadly based as it has been thus 
far. For example, dairy products have recently 
become cheaper. Prices for unprocessed fruit 
and vegetables have also receded. However, as 
a result of the sharp rises in prices at the start 
of 2023, inflation for food products will remain 
in double  digits overall on average for the year.

food) and services, it is likely that price pres -In subsequent

and unit profits.
26 In addition, a role was played by the fact that, as part 
of the annual update, the weight of energy in the HICP 
was significantly reduced. See Deutsche Bundesbank

sures will be maintained by corporate profit 
margins, which are widening slightly again. At 
the same time, the price pressure driven by la -
bour costs, which is already high, will continue 
to mount. Combined, these will result in the 
core rate rising from 3.9% last year to 5.2% 
this year.27 By contrast, headline HICP inflation 
will abate from 8.7% to 6.0%.
Energy price inflation in 2024 will initially only 
be slightly lower than in 2023. One reason for 
this is the increase in the carbon price levied on 
petroleum products and gas since 2021.28 Fur-
thermore, in the second quarter of the year, 
government relief measures, such as the tem -
porary reduction in the VAT rate for natural gas 
and district heating, as well as the electricity 
and gas price brakes, will expire. According to 
the projection, the uncapped retail tariffs for 
electricity and gas will be only slightly higher 
than the levels of the price brakes. As a result, 
consumer prices will rise only slightly once the 
price brakes expire. This rebound effect is thus set to be significantly smaller than had been ex -
pected last December. Food price inflation is 
expected to decline very significantly. One fac -
tor here is the assumed fall in producer prices. 
In addition, weather- related price pressures will 
have dissipated, and lower energy prices will 
have an indirect easing effect. Much the same 
applies to the core rate. Here, there will add -
itionally be an easing of the upward pressure 
from profit margins, as these are set to decline 
somewhat. At the same time, the sharp rise in 
labour costs will continue to put considerable 
pressure on prices. On balance, the core rate 
will drop to 3.1% and will thus be on a par with 
the headline rate.Energy and food

In the final year of the projection horizon, the 
inflation rate will continue to decline some -
what, though it will remain at a high level. En -
ergy price inflation will continue to ease owing 
to lagged adjustments to the lower market 
prices for electricity and gas. The price pressure 
from labour costs, which is significant for the 
rate excluding energy, will also no longer be as 
exceedingly strong as in previous years. How -
ever, it will still be considerable, partly because 
the rising labour costs will be passed through 
to consumers, in some cases with a significant 
time lag. Import prices will also continue to 
exert some inflationary pressure. Finally, other 
cost factors will play a greater role than in the 
past, for example in terms of the green trans -
formation. All in all, the headline rate for 2025 
will fall to 2.7% and the core rate will fall to 
2.8%.Public finances
According to this projection, the general gov -
ernment deficit ratio will stand at 2.4% for 
2023, down slightly on the year (2022: 2.7% of 
GDP). This is because, on balance, temporary 
crisis measures are placing less pressure on the 
budget (for more on the measures, see p. 20). 
However, the deficit will fall significantly less 
than the decline in temporary crisis measures 
would indicate. This is first of all because high 
inflation and its consequences are increasingly 
pushing up expenditure, with interest expend -
iture and current operating expenditure, in par -
ticular, rising significantly. Second, general gov -
ernment is increasing its expenditure on de -
fence and climate policy substantially. And 
third, tax developments are restrained, which is 
also indicated by the subdued tax revenue 
growth over the course of the year to date.
Compared with the previous year, the deficit 
ratio will fall considerably in 2024 to 1.2%. In 
2025, it will remain more or less unchanged at 
1.1%. The temporary crisis measures will expire 
to a large extent in 2024 and completely in 
2025. This, however, will be counteracted by 
rising shortfalls in the central government’s off- 
budget entities for climate mitigation and the 
armed forces. In addition, inflation will increas -
ingly impact major wage- related expenditure, 
with compensation for employees and pension 
expenditure growing significantly as a result of 
dynamic wage increases.
The structural budgetary position will deterior -
ate over the projection horizon29 on the back 
of significant increases in expenditure. Expend -
iture on pensions, climate protection and de -
fence, in particular, will grow considerably up 
to 2025. The structural deficit will ultimately 
amount to around 1% of GDP in 2025.In 2025, the

According to this projection, the debt ratio will 
fall significantly and amount to 62% at the end 
of 2025 (2022: 66.2%). The decline is mainly 
due to the strong growth in nominal GDP , 
which constitutes the debt ratio’s denominator. 
In addition, central government is financing 
part of its 2023 deficit using cash reserves ac -
cumulated during the coronavirus pandemic 
rather than through new borrowing. Moreover, 
it is paring back debt related to coronavirus as -
sistance loans and bad bank portfolios stem -
ming from the financial crisis. If looked at in 
isolation, other factors will increase debt some -
what in 2023. As financial transactions, they do 
not impact the deficit. They include a central 
government loan to build up capital in the 
statutory pension insurance scheme and trans -
fers to the IMF Resilience and Sustainability 
Trust, a trust fund for pandemics and climate 
protection in low- income countries. Further -
more, it should be noted that surpluses run by 
the Federal Employment Agency and the long- 
term care insurance scheme, in particular, are 
not used to repay debt, but instead to increase 
reserves.
Risk assessment
Owing to a significant reduction in gas con -
sumption and increased deliveries from other 
countries, uncertainty regarding the gas and 
electricity supply in Germany has declined sig -
nificantly since December. However, a renewed 
heightening of tensions in the energy markets 
cannot be ruled out. For this reason, too, the 
projections described here are subject to a de -
gree of uncertainty which, while lower than in 
December, remains elevated. Additional uncer -
tainties exist, particularly about how long the 
high inflation will persist. From today’s per -
spective, the risks with regard to inflation ap -
pear to be mostly tilted to the upside, and 
those with regard to economic growth mostly 
to the downside.
In view of the high inflation rates, the Euro -
system started to rein in its very expansionary monetary policy in December 2021.30 The ef -
fects of this monetary policy normalisation and 
tightening are now widely visible. In this pro -
jection, they have a dampening effect on busi -
ness and housing investment, for example, 
and, through weaker aggregate demand, also 
on inflation. So far, there are no indications for 
Germany that the tightening of monetary pol -
icy is having a significantly stronger effect than 
empirically estimated historical correlations 
would suggest. Nevertheless, the tighter mon -
etary policy could also give rise to stronger or 
unintended effects. For example, the possibility 
of turmoil occurring in the European banking 
sector due to the interest rate hikes cannot be 
ruled out.31 The tighter monetary policy could 
also have an increased impact on the financial 
system if there were a considerable fall in house 
prices. In the event of future credit defaults, 
lenders could incur higher losses because the 
collateral on real estate loans would be worth 
less. In the worst- case scenario, these risks 
could have a negative impact on the real econ -
omy through reduced lending.32 Overall, 
stronger effects of the tighter monetary policy 
therefore represent a downside risk to eco -
nomic growth and price inflation.
The easing in the gas market has led to gas 
storage facilities currently being much better 
filled than they were in the past at this time of 
year. Owing to this and other factors, the prob -
ability of a gas shortage in the coming winters 
is significantly lower than in the December pro -
jection. Nevertheless, it is not possible to rule 
out energy supply problems arising once again.

here or gas consumption could be higher – for Debt ratio will

30 At that time, it was decided to end net asset purchases, 
both under the pandemic emergency purchase programme 
(PEPP) and –  faster than initially envisaged  – under the 
asset purchase programme (APP). Furthermore, the key 
interest rates were raised sharply. For more information, 
see p. 19.
31 A case in point – albeit comparable to the situation in 
Germany only to a limited extent – is represented by the 
events surrounding Silicon Valley Bank, which became dis -
tressed in March 2023 in part owing to tighter monetary 
policy in the United States.

example, due to an unusually cold winter. This 
would be accompanied by additional price in -
creases. If gas were then actually to be ra -
tioned, economic output could be significantly 
lower.33 There is also a risk of mounting or add -
itional geopolitical tensions, especially in con -
nection with the Ukraine war, but also in Asia, 
for example. They could have an impact on 
global commodity prices or trigger sanctions 
that could disrupt supply chains. Such supply-  
side impediments are likely to weigh on global 
and German economic activity and increase 
price pressures.
The forward prices for crude oil on which these 
projections are based point to a certain decline 
in prices. However, the price of oil could also 
increase. For example, the International Energy 
Agency expects the global oil markets to be 
significantly undersupplied in the remainder of 
the year, partly as a result of rising Chinese de -
mand.34 By contrast, prices for other commod -
ities, such as food, could fall faster than as -
sumed in the projection. In the case of food 
prices for end consumers, cost reductions could 
also potentially be passed through more quickly 
if competition in the retail trade has a greater 
impact than expected. In the case of energy, 
too, the lower market prices for natural gas 
and electricity could be passed through to con -
sumers even more quickly than assumed. In 
both cases, the inflation rate would decelerate 
more rapidly and economic activity would be 
strengthened.35
There are upside risks to domestic demand, for 
example with regard to fiscal policy. The Fed -
eral Government is currently discussing new ex -
penditure, such as higher defence spending 
and subsidies for cheaper industrial electricity. Uncertainties

35 However, this would probably also give rise to greater 
political leeway to expand climate policy measures. For ex -
ample, the Federal Government postponed the increase in 
the carbon price at the beginning of 2023 due to the high 
energy prices. If it were to be raised sooner again in the 
light of lower energy prices, this – viewed in isolation – 
would increase inflationary pressures.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
June 2023  
34

If fiscal policy were subsequently to become 
more expansionary than assumed, this would 
probably bolster real GDP growth, but at the 
same time further increase inflation.36 There 
would be similar consequences if the remaining 
coronavirus savings that households accumu -
lated involuntarily in 2020 and 2021 were to be 
used for consumption purposes to a greater 
extent than assumed in the projection. The sav -
ing ratio could then fall significantly below its 
pre- pandemic level. Private consumption – and 
economic activity  – would recover more 
strongly. At the same time, however, price pres -
sures would also increase.
Underlying inflation has recently proved sur -
prisingly persistent, and there is a risk that the 
persistence of the core rate over the projection 
horizon will also be greater than assumed. For 
example, wages could grow even more 
strongly, say if workers succeed in fully recoup -
ing the real wage losses they have suffered. 
More sharply rising wages would also be ex -
pected if the situation on the labour market 
were to become even tighter than assumed. 
Both of these factors would have stronger second- round effects on prices, which would 
contribute to high inflation becoming en -
trenched. If demand is stronger than expected, 
firms may additionally be able to maintain 
higher profit margins for an extended period of 
time or raise them even further. However, in 
such a scenario where wages rise more sharply, 
profit margins increase, or where both happen 
together, inflation is likely to remain signifi -
cantly higher for a longer period of time than 
expected in the projection. In the medium 
term, this would increase the risk of the already 
very high inflation rate becoming further en -
trenched. This underscores the importance of 
decisive monetary policy action in counteract -
ing persistently high inflation and the associ -
ated economic and societal risks it entails.Upside risks to

particular. In this case, however, the fiscal costs are less 
relevant for the macroeconomic projection: If they are 
lower, this reflects lower energy costs for end consumers in 
Germany, and if they are higher, it reflects higher energy 
costs for such consumers. The price brakes thus shield 
households’ purchasing power and enterprises’ profit situ -
ation to a large extent from potential fluctuations in energy 
costs.Deutsche Bundesbank

Developments in bank interest rates in 
 Germany during the period of monetary 
policy tightening
The monetary policy tightening observed since the beginning of 2022, unprecedented in the euro 
area, has pushed up market interest rates and also fed into the interest rates on both bank loans 
and bank deposits in Germany. That is consistent with the monetary policy objective of curbing 
lending in order, via falling aggregate demand, to bring the excessively high inflation rate down 
to target. However, there is also a monetary policy interest in knowing whether monetary policy 
measures are currently being transmitted to the envisaged extent. Is interest rate pass- through 
still consistent with – or at odds with – the relationships observed in the past between market 
interest rates and the various bank interest rates?
It is quite normal for different bank interest rates to respond to differing degrees and at differing 
speeds to changes in market interest rates which, in turn, are determined in part by monetary 
policy. The present analysis, however, shows that, since May 2022, banks in Germany have raised 
the interest rate on loans to households for house purchase more strongly than stood to be 
expected. This was probably due mainly to the significantly higher credit risk. For small- sized 
loans to enterprises, by contrast, the actual lending rate spent some periods during 2022 at levels 
that were below the interest rate that would have been normal based on past interest rate pass- 
through patterns. The increased provision of working capital loans with short interest rate fixation 
periods is likely to have played a role in this. Since the end of 2022, however, the interest rate on 
loans to enterprises has been moving in line with historical patterns again.
Unlike lending rates, the interest rate on overnight deposits of non- financial corporations and 
households has so far registered no more than a marginal rise. Although such a lagged response 
was also observed in previous monetary policy tightening periods, since September 2022, the 
pass- through of interest rates has been even slower than in the past.
The relatively rapid rise in lending rates and the stickiness of deposit rates meant that banks were 
able to widen their interest margins in outstanding lending and deposit business. Widening mar -
gins in banks’ lending and deposit business, which tend to be unusual during periods of rising 
interest rates but have been in evidence since 2022, could be a transitory phenomenon, however. 
Competition for deposits is slowly picking up, which will probably put upward pressure on the 
interest rate on overnight deposits going forward. If interest expenditure then rises more strongly 
than banks’ interest income, margins could quickly contract again.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
The change of course in monetary policy in 
early 2022 necessitated by the rise in inflation is 
also reflected in the interest rates on bank 
loans and bank deposits in Germany. The chart 
on p.  41 shows that, during the preceding 
period of negative interest rates, banks in Ger -
many cut their interest rates on new loans and 
for customer deposits to one new all- time low 
after another.1 It was from that low level that 
interest rates on new loans to non- financial 
corporations and households as well as the 
interest rate on time deposits began to rise 
steeply in 2022. As for the interest rate on 
overnight deposits, however, the banks have 
thus far hardly responded to the rapid succes -
sion of policy rate hikes.2
The observed developments raise various ques -
tions: Why was it that bank interest rates were 
raised to differing degrees and at differing 
speeds? Was and is the rate- setting behaviour 
of banks in Germany – measured against the 
strength of monetary policy tightening – un -
usual, or is it consistent with the patterns ob -
served in the past?
Where the results indicate that the transmis -
sion of monetary policy to lending rates has 
been significantly weaker or stronger than ex -
pected, this must be taken into account when 
assessing the growth and inflation outlook for 
Germany.3 And then there is the question of 
how the turnaround in interest rates is impact -
ing on the banking sector. In the light of the 
turmoil in the US banking industry this spring, 
the impact of interest rate hikes on banks’ prof -
itability has come under growing public scru -
tiny.
In order to answer these questions, this article 
first outlines the factors that guide how banks 
set interest rates on loans and deposits and the 
role played therein by market interest rates. The 
two subsequent sections will then zoom in on 
developments in, respectively, lending and de -
posit rates in Germany since the end of the negative interest rate policy period. Empirical 
interest rate pass- through models are used to 
examine banks’ rate- setting behaviour since 
the beginning of 2022 to determine whether it 
is consistent with – or at odds with – historical 
patterns. The analysis also illuminates how de -
velopments in Germany differ from those in the 
euro area as a whole. It concludes by illustrat -
ing the impact of differences between loans 
and deposits in terms of interest rate increases 
on banks’ margins in Germany.
Banks’ rate- setting behaviour
Banks largely set their interest rates on the 
basis of two factors: the pattern of their fund -
ing costs, which is closely tied to developments 
in market interest rates and thus also the yield 
curve in the market; and various mark- ups (on 
loans) and markdowns (on deposits) relative to 
the level of market interest rates.4
Most of the time, developments in funding 
costs are the key determinant of adjustments 
to lending and deposit rates. As a rule, banks 
set their rates based on developments in mar -
ket interest rates for a maturity comparable to 
the interest rate fixation period of the respect -
ive loan or the customer deposit.5 This means 
that interest rates on loans and deposits can 
develop differently depending on the length of 
the interest rate fixation period.Interest rates on

1 According to the MFI interest rate statistics, the aggre -
gate interest rate on loans to non- financial corporations in 
Germany reached a historical low in March 2021; for the 
interest rate on loans for house purchase, this was the case 
in December 2020. The interest rate on time deposits bot -
tomed out in December 2021, while the interest rate on 
overnight deposits did not reach its low until May 2022.

2023.

Mark- ups or markdowns, on the other hand, 
impact on the level of bank interest rates rela -
tive to the level of market interest rates. Com -
pared with the dynamics of market interest 
rates, mark- ups and markdowns tend to 
change more sluggishly, but here, too, individ -
ual factors can become more or less important 
over time. This means, first, various compon -
ents of banks’ costs that are not already con -
tained in market interest rates: these include 
the amount of banks’ actual funding costs or 
–  for lending rates  – the price allocated to 
credit risk. Second, banks’ price- setting power 
in the markets for loans and deposits can play 
a role. That can impact on banks’ profit target. 
Third, regulatory requirements can also affect 
rate- setting. These include, for instance, the 
capital requirement for loans.Interest rates on bank loans

The trajectory of market interest rates, which

stance: changes in the monetary policy path 
are transmitted to bank interest rates via mar -
ket interest rates.6 During the current interest 
rate hike cycle, policy rates have, since July 
2022, been raised more quickly and signifi -

Monetary policy tightening and the trajectory of market 
interest rates
The trajectory of market interest rates, 
which banks use as their main source of 
guidance when setting their interest rates 
on new loans and deposits, is itself depend-
ent on the monetary policy stance. Changes 
in the monetary policy stance are thus 
transmitted via market interest rates to 
bank interest rates.
As infl  ation was too low, the ECB Govern-
ing Council’s monetary policy became in-
creasingly expansionary from 2014 on-
wards.1 As a result, market interest rates 
repeatedly reached new lows.2 Because the 
monetary policy asset purchase pro-
grammes3 also considerably lowered 
longer- term market interest rates, the yield 
curve was fl  at. However, over the course of 
2021, the rate of infl  ation rose signifi  cantly 
and exceeded 2% for the fi  rst time again 
from July of that year. Against this back-
ground, the ECB Governing Council started 
to gradually reduce its asset purchase pro-
grammes in December 2021.4 At the same 
time, the targeted longer- term refi  nancing 
operations (TLTRO III) were discontinued.5 This heralded a change in the course of 
monetary policy that led to a rise in market 
interest rates from the end of 2021, initially 
affecting longer- term interest rates (see the 
chart below). As a result, the spread be-
tween short- term and longer- term market 
rates widened signifi  cantly, which made the 
yield curve considerably steeper.
As infl  ation had climbed persistently, the 
ECB Governing Council ultimately started to 
increase  its key interest rates in July 2022. 
So far, it has raised the key rates by a total 
of 400 basis points across eight steps. In 
terms of the magnitude and speed of these 
interest rate hikes, this tightening cycle is

month EURIBOR reached its minimum in December 
2021 and the yield on ten- year German government 
bonds reached its minimum in August 2019.
3 The expanded asset purchase programme (APP) and 
the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP).
4 First, the ECB Governing Council announced that it 
would gradually reduce its net asset purchases under 
the asset purchase programmes; see European Central 
Bank (2021). In June 2022, it decided that net pur-
chases under the APP would end on 1 July 2022; see 
European Central Bank (2022a). In December 2022, it 
decided that, as of February 2023, the principal pay-
ments from maturing securities purchased under the 
APP would no longer be reinvested in full; see Euro-
pean Central Bank (2022e). Finally, in June 2023, it an-
nounced that it would discontinue the reinvestment of 
principal payments under the APP as of July 2023; see 
European Central Bank (2023d).
5 The tenth and fi  nal operation was allocated in De-
cember 2021. As banks are required to repay these 
loans to the Eurosystem in stages up until the end of 
2024, the amount of outstanding funds is gradually 
declining. In October 2022, the ECB Governing Council 
decided to recalibrate the interest rate conditions for 
the third series of TLTROs to ensure consistency with 
the broader monetary policy tightening process; see 
European Central Bank (2022d). Based on this deci-
sion, the interest rate on all remaining TLTRO III oper-
ations was indexed to the average applicable key ECB 
interest rates from 23 November 2022 onwards. Fur-
thermore, additional dates for voluntary early repay-
ments were offered.Selected market interest rates

July 2021, the inflation rate rapidly surged even 
more significantly as a result of Russia’s war 
against Ukraine and the economic fallout 
thereof, making it necessary to tighten monet -
ary policy more strongly. Unlike in the past, 
however, policy rates started from an unpre -
cedentedly low, and in some cases even nega -
tive, level. As a result of the sharp rise in market 
interest rates, interest rates on new loans (new 
business)7 in Germany and the euro area rose 
considerably more steeply in 2022 than in the 
preceding period of tightening. As is shown by 
a comparison with the pre- financial crisis years 
(see the chart on p. 41), interest rates have thus 
far still not returned to their level back then 
despite the sharp rise.8
In anticipation of the forthcoming tightening of 
monetary policy and due to the gradual scaling- 
back of the asset purchase programmes,9 mar-
ket interest rates began to rise even in advance 
of the first monetary policy interest rate move 
in July 2022, with interest rates on new loans already picking up in response to this early on 
in the second quarter of 2022. The increase in 
lending rates as from April 2022 for loans to 
enterprises was only marginally stronger in 
Germany than in the euro area as a whole. On 
the other hand, banks in Germany raised inter -
est rates on loans to households for house pur -
chase to a considerably greater extent than 
Lending rates 
likewise up 
significantly  
in 2022unprecedented for the Eurosystem.6 As the 
market had previously been expecting key 
interest rate hikes for the near future, short- 
term interest rates started to rise signifi  -
cantly as early as the second quarter of 
2022. As a result, the yield curve fl  attened 
again. The increase in short- term market 
interest rates has continued almost continu-
ously up to the current end since the fi  rst 
key interest rate hike in this cycle. By con-
trast, the gloomier economic expectations 
mean that long- term market interest rates 
have remained largely constant since the 
fourth quarter of 2022. Consequently, the 
yield curve fl  attened further and inverted in 
the fi  rst quarter of 2023, i.e. short- term 
interest rates exceeded longer- term interest 
rates.6 On 21 July 2022, in response to the updated assess-
ment of infl  ation risks, the ECB Governing Council de-
cided to raise its key  interest rates by 50 basis points; 
see European Central Bank (2022b). The Governing 
Council decided to raise its key interest rates by an 
additional 75 basis points each on 8 September 2022 
and 27  October 2022, by 50 basis points each on 
15 December 2022, 2 February 2023 and 16 March 
2023, and fi  nally by 25 basis points each on 4 May 
2023 and 15 June 2023; see European Central Bank 
(2022c, 2022d, 2022e, 2023a, 2023b, 2023c, 2023d). 
On 8 September 2022, it decided to suspend the two- 
tier system for the remuneration of excess reserves; see 
European Central Bank (2022c).
7 Based on the MFI interest rate statistics. In a representa -
tive sample of credit institutions in Germany, the Bundes -
bank collects data on new loans and deposits in Germany 
on a monthly basis. These data include both interest rates 
and volumes and are broken down, in particular, by initial 
interest rate fixation period and loan amount. The bank 
data are extrapolated and merged to form aggregated and 
sub- aggregated total results for individual loan and deposit 
categories for Germany and made publicly available.
8 Consumer credit and other lending to households are an 
exception. As this loan category is of relatively minor im -
portance for banks, it will not be covered in further detail 
in this article. On a multi- year average, consumer credit 
and other lending to households accounts for only around 
15% of the loan portfolio of banks in Germany.

banks in the euro area as a whole.10 The fact 
that the usual interest rate fixation periods for 
housing loans in Germany are significantly 
longer than in the euro area as a whole con -
tributed to this divergence.
Importance of the various 
interest rate fixation periods
Loans to households for house purchase in 
Germany and also in the euro area as a whole 
predominantly have long interest rate fixation 
periods. However, an analysis of banks’ loan 
portfolio (see the chart on p. 45) shows that the  
share of loans to households with a short inter -
est rate fixation period is significantly higher in 
the euro area than in Germany.11 Whereas in 
Germany and France very long interest rate fix -
ation periods are quite common, in other coun -
tries, such as Spain and Italy, loans generally 
have variable rates. This means that the 
weighted average interest rate fixation period 
for loans for house purchase across all euro 
area countries is significantly lower than in Ger -
many. Hence, banks in Germany price these 
loans mostly on the basis of longer- term mar -
ket interest rates compared with the euro area 
on average. Because these market interest 
rates rose earlier and more sharply than shorter- 
term ones in 2022 owing to the gradual 
scaling- back of the monetary policy asset pur -Loans to house -

10 In a comparison of euro area countries, interest rates on 
loans for house purchase rose most strongly in Germany. 
However, such rates also rose early on and relatively 
strongly in other euro area countries in which, as in Ger -
many, long interest rate fixation periods are common prac -
tice. France is an exception; there, the rise in the interest 
rate on loans for house purchase is subject to a statutory 
cap (taux d’usure) which is adjusted at regular intervals. 
See Banque de France (2023a).
11 Information on the frequencies of various interest rate 
fixation periods is available only for new business volumes 
collected for the MFI interest rate statistics, but not for the 
loan portfolio. In the monthly balance sheet statistics, how -
ever, for the loan portfolio at least the share of loans at 
variable interest rates or with an initial interest rate fixation 
period of up to one year is available separately for loans to 
enterprises and loans to households. These data on the 
loan portfolio are more meaningful than the corresponding 
data on new business volumes. This is because, in this cat -
egory, short interest rate fixation periods have a very high 
weight since such loans are more frequently rolled over 
and then re- recorded as new business.Deutsche Bundesbank

chase programmes, lending rates in Germany 
likewise rose more rapidly and considerably 
than in the euro area as a whole.
For bank loans to non- financial corporations, 
variable rate agreements and short interest rate 
fixation periods are common in both Germany 
and the euro area as a whole (see the adjacent 
chart). However, in this loan category, too, the 
average interest rate fixation period in Ger -
many is longer than in the euro area as a 
whole. If long-  term market interest rates rise 
more sharply than short- term ones, conse -
quently aggregate lending rates will rise more 
strongly in Germany than in the euro area as a 
whole. This effect is more pronounced for 
loans for house purchase than for loans to en -
terprises.12
Transmission of changes 
in market interest rates to 
lending  rates
As mentioned above, banks typically pass 
through changes in their own funding costs to 
their borrowers. In a normal market environ -
ment, developments in banks’ funding costs 
can be modelled well by market interest rate 
dynamics. The empirical models for bank inter -
est rate pass- through presented in the box on 
pp. 49 ff. take advantage of this relationship, 
examining how quickly and to what extent 
changes in reference interest rates are passed 
through to bank customers in the form of 
changes in lending rates. In the case of lending 
rates in new business, a market interest rate 
with a similar interest rate fixation period to the 
respective lending rate is used as the reference 
interest rate.13
The interest rate pass- through models can be 
used to determine two things: first, how quickly 
banks responded to changes in market interest 
rates in the past. These models show that the 
interest rates on loans to enterprises and loans 
to households for house purchase in Germany 
and the euro area alike almost completely re -flect changes in the respective reference inter -
est rate. Usually, changes in reference interest 
rates are largely passed through within the first 
few months in the case of loans to enterprises, 
but take longer to be passed through to loans 
to households for house purchase.
Second, these models can be used to check 
whether interest rate pass- through in a given 
period is consistent or at odds with historical 
patterns. If the latter is true, this suggests that 
when setting interest rates, banks gave a differ -
ent weighting to other factors –  at least at 
times – as well as basing their rates on market 
interest rate developments. The models there -
fore help to answer the questions raised at the 
beginning of this article: has banks’ rate- setting 
behaviour been unusual since the start of mon -
etary policy tightening compared with the rela -
tionships observed in the past? Why is it that 
bank interest rates have been raised to differ -
ent degrees and at different speeds?

Developments in the interest rate differential between 
loans with long and short interest rate fi  xation periods
MFI interest rate statistics provide informa-
tion on aggregate lending rates across all 
interest rate fi  xation periods, as well as dis-
aggregated data broken down into differ-
ent interest rate fi  xation periods. Lending 
rates with shorter and longer interest rate 
fi  xation periods can take differing paths 
over time. Since lending rates usually move 
in line with market interest rates, the inter-
est rate differential between loans with a 
long interest rate fi  xation period (more than 
ten years) and those with a short fi  xation 
period (up to one year) depends on the 
slope of the yield curve. Changes in the 
slope of the yield curve resulting from mon-
etary policy measures are therefore also 
largely refl  ected in developments in interest 
rate differentials for loans to enterprises 
and loans to households for house pur-
chase. Loans with a longer interest rate fi  x-
ation period can theoretically also systemat-
ically differ from loans with a shorter fi  x-
ation period in other ways than the interest 
rate fi  xation. However, analyses using credit 
microdata for loans to enterprises do show 
that a longer interest rate fi  xation period 
actually induces higher lending rates when 
the yield curve is very steep.1
In spite of the fact that the interest rate dif-
ferential in Germany is not the same as that 
of the euro area (see the chart on p. 47), de-
velopments were largely similar. As the yield 
curve in the market fl  attened during the 
period of negative interest rates due to the 
non- standard monetary policy measures, 
interest rate differentials for bank loans 
with different interest rate fi  xation periods 
also contracted. In Germany, the rates on 
loans to enterprises and loans to house-
holds for house purchase even fell into 
negative territory at times.2 The historically low interest rate in Germany on loans to 
households for house purchase with an 
interest rate fi  xation period of more than 
ten years is likely to have been a key factor 
in the strong demand for these loans over 
recent years, as well as in the ever increas-
ing share of volumes of new business.3
From the beginning of 2022, banks again 
began to raise interest rates on loans to en-
terprises and loans for house purchase with 
medium and longer interest rate fi  xation 
periods more strongly than on loans with 
short interest rate fi  xation periods, in line 
with the steepening of the yield curve in the 
market. Interest rate differentials turned 
positive, standing at particularly high levels 
in the second and third quarters of 2022. 
Analyses based on microdata for loans to 
enterprises also show that the length of the 
interest rate fi  xation period was a strong 
factor in pushing up lending rates, particu-
larly in these two quarters.4 The increase in 
the interest rate differential for loans to 
households for house purchase was consid-
erably higher in Germany than in the other 
1 See the box on the infl  uence of borrower and loan- 
related factors on the interest rate for bank loans to 
non- fi  nancial corporations on p. 53 f.
2 In 2020 and 2021, new loans to households for 
house purchase with an interest rate fi  xation period of 
more than ten years were over 50 basis points cheaper 
in Germany than loans with a short interest rate fi  x-
ation period. Loans to households for house purchase 
with a medium- term interest rate fi  xation period of be-
tween one and ten years were also more favourable at 
that time than loans with either a short- term or no 
interest rate fi  xation period.
3 The average interest rate fi  xation period is also likely 
to have increased considerably during the period of 
negative interest rates within the reported maturity 
bands, and particularly in the longest maturity band of 
more than ten years. Banks are also likely to have is-
sued more loans with an interest rate fi  xation period of 
longer than 20 years.

large euro area countries and in the euro 
area as a whole. In the spring of 2022, it 
was precisely these loans to households for 
house purchase commonly issued with a 
long interest rate fi  xation period that be-
came considerably more expensive in Ger-
many within the space of a few months 
compared to those with a short interest 
rate fi  xation period. As a result, in relative 
terms, the demand for loans with a short 
interest rate fi  xation period began to rise 
again.
As the market interest rate yield curve fl  at-
tened again in the second half of 2022 and 
inverted at the beginning of 2023, interest 
rate differentials in Germany and the euro 
area once more followed suit, with those 
for both loans to enterprises and loans to 
households for house purchase falling 
steeply and entering negative territory.Interest rate differential and volume

the period from the beginning of 2003 to the 
end of 2021. For the period after that, the ac -
tual interest rates set over the period of monet -
ary policy tightening from the beginning of 
2022 up to the last available data point in April 
2023 are compared with the path that interest 
rates would otherwise have taken based on ac -
tual movements in the reference interest rates14 
and the estimated model relationship. What 
this shows is that, in 2022, pass-  through into 
the interest rate on loans to enterprises in Ger -
many initially took place as expected (see the 
above chart). Between August and November 
2022, however, the actual lending rate was 
–  to a statistically significant degree  – just 
under the interest rate that would have been 
expected based on historical interest rate pass- 
through patterns. A separate analysis traces 
this deviation back to banks’ rate-  setting be -
haviour for small- sized loans to enterprises. The 
actual interest rate on these loans between 
May and November 2022 was, in some cases, 
significantly lower than the rate calculated based on the model. This did not apply to 
large- volume loans to enterprises. In the euro 
area, interest rate pass- through to the lending 
rate for loans to enterprises has been largely 
consistent with historical relationships since the 
beginning of 2022.
What could be behind the unusual rate- setting 
behaviour of banks in Germany for small- sized 
loans to enterprises in the second and third 
quarters of 2022? An analysis of microdata for 
the period from the fourth quarter of 2021 to 
the first quarter of 2023 can provide insights 
into which types of loans were granted at rela -
tively favourable interest rates.15 There tended 
to be an interest rate- reducing effect when a 
loan had a short interest rate fixation period. 
This was particularly true in the second and 
third quarters of 2022, when the interest rate 
for loans with long interest rate fixation periods 
was raised to a much stronger degree in line 
with market interest rate developments than 
for loans with short interest rate fixation 
periods. This also triggered shifts in volumes to -
wards loans with short interest rate fixation 
periods (see the chart on p. 47). In addition, 
loans with a lower default risk tended to be 
offered at a lower interest rate than those 
where the risk of default was greater. There 
were also circumstances in which certain riskier 
prospective borrowers stopped being serviced 
altogether. One indication of this may be the 
multiple increases in the rejection rate for loans 
to enterprises as shown by the results of the 
Bank Lending Survey (BLS) in 2022.16 Lastly, 
loans intended to be used to finance working 
capital were granted at a lower interest rate 
than loans for other purposes. According to 
the banks surveyed in the BLS, however, de -
mand for precisely these loans was particularly 
strong in 2022, partly because the global sup -Interest rate

Interest rate pass- through into bank loans and customer 
deposits
Interest rate pass- through concerns the de-
gree to which banks pass changes in the 
monetary policy stance through to bank 
customers by adjusting their lending and 
deposit rates accordingly. Since changes in 
the monetary policy stance are normally 
transmitted immediately and completely to 
money and capital market rates, the analy-
sis of interest rate pass- through in the 
stricter sense of the term focuses on how 
developments in these markets are trans-
mitted to bank interest rates.
Bank lending and deposit rates usually 
move in line with market interest rates with 
a similar interest rate fi  xation period. Some 
of the adjustment takes place immediately 
and another part with a lag. Empirically, 
error correction models (ECMs) are well 
suited to investigating the pass- through of 
interest rates.1 These models use a market 
interest rate as a reference interest rate for 
the corresponding rates on new loans or 
deposits. ECMs perform two functions. 
First, they plot the long- term correlation be-
tween a bank interest rate and a reference 
interest rate. This is conditional on a long- 
term equilibrium relationship (cointegra-
tion) existing between the two underlying 
interest rates. Second, they capture the 
short- term dynamics of the correlation be-
tween the interest rates observed. In this 
context, the coeffi   cient for immediate inter-
est rate pass- through shows the degree to 
which changes in the reference interest rate 
are passed through simultaneously to the 
respective lending or deposit rate.
The table on p. 50 provides an overview of 
the specifi  cations and results of the interest 
rate pass- through models used at the 
Bundesbank for loans to enterprises and for loans to households for house purchase. 
The models are estimated for the period 
from the beginning of 2003 to the end of 
2021, with separate sets of monthly data 
for Germany and the euro area. Using these 
empirical models, it is possible to investi-
gate whether interest rate pass- through 
during the period of monetary policy tight-
ening since the beginning of 2022 is con-
sistent with historical patterns or deviates 
from them to a statistically signifi  cant de-
gree. This is done by comparing the actual 
interest rates set from the beginning of 
2022 up to the last available data point in 
April 2023 with the path that interest rates 
would otherwise have taken based on 
movements in reference interest rates, and 
also (if applicable) changes in the risk meas-
ure as well as the estimated model relation-
ships (see the remarks on pp. 48 ff.).2
A long- term equilibrium relationship (coin-
tegration) with a money market rate is 
found to exist for the interest rate on loans 
to non- fi  nancial corporations in Germany. 
For the euro area, a long- term equilibrium 
relationship between the variables only 
exists in cases where a yield spread is added 
to the model as a risk measure.3 A refer-

through of interest rates into loans to 
households for house purchase in Germany, 
given the fact that interest rate fi  xation 
periods tend to be long in Germany in this 
loan category. Interest rate fi  xation periods 
in euro area countries, meanwhile, vary no-
ticeably, besides being shorter overall than 
in Germany. A long- term relationship is 
therefore found to exist with a money mar-
ket rate.
The long- term pass- through coeffi   cients for 
the respective reference interest rates are 
between 0.8 and 0.9 in all the models (see 
the above table), which means that the de-
gree of interest rate pass- through is almost 
complete over the long run. At around 
70%, the immediate pass- through of 
changes in the reference interest rate within 
the same month is signifi  cantly higher for 
loans to enterprises than it is for loans to 
households for house purchase, where the 
equivalent fi  gure is no more than approxi-
mately 10%. Thus, movements in reference 
interest rates are largely passed through 
within the fi  rst few months in the case of loans to enterprises, but take longer to be 
passed through into loans to households 
for house purchase.
The remuneration paid by banks for cus-
tomer deposits can likewise be based on 
movements in a market interest rate. This is 
why there may be circumstances in which 
long- term equilibrium relationships exist be-
tween deposit and reference interest rates. 
Deposits by non- fi  nancial corporations and 
households have either next- day maturity 
(overnight deposits), a longer maturity (time 
deposits) or are redeemable at notice (sav-
ings deposits). This means that short- term 
or longer- term money market rates are the 
best fi  t for reference interest rates in the 
empirical interest rate pass- through models.
The table on p. 51 provides an overview of 
the results of the interest rate pass- through 
models for overnight deposits, savings de-
posits and time deposits. In the case of the 
interest rate on overnight deposits (aggre-
gated across non- fi  nancial corporations and 
households), there is very limited immediate Interest rate pass-through in lending business (estimation period 2003-21)O

pass- through of changes in the reference 
interest rate within the same month in Ger-
many and the euro area alike, at approxi-
mately 10%. Strikingly, the interest rate 
tends to respond more rapidly in the case of 
overnight deposits by enterprises than for 
deposits by households.4 Long- term interest 
rate pass- through to overnight deposits is 
only moderate and incomplete for both cat-
egories of depositors, at around 50% in 
Germany. The story is much the same for 
interest rate pass- through to savings de-
posits, while for time deposits, changes in 
the reference interest rate are quicker to 
pass through to the interest rate. At just 
over 80%, interest rate pass-through to 
time deposits in Germany is almost com-
plete over the long term. For the euro area, 
a cointegration relationship with a market 
interest rate exists in neither the overnight 
deposits model nor the time deposits 
model. Therefore, only the coeffi   cient of the immediate pass- through of interest 
rates can be interpreted.
For deposits, too, we investigated how far 
the actual interest rates set since the begin-
ning of 2022 have differed from the path 
that interest rates would otherwise have 
taken based on actual movements in refer-
ence interest rates and the estimated model 
relationships (see the remarks on p. 56 f.).

coeffi   cient for immediate pass- through comes to 0.36

households.Interest rate pass-through in deposit business (estimation period 2003-21)O

ply bottlenecks necessitated greater liquidity 
holdings.
In contrast to the finding for loans to enter -
prises, interest rate pass- through to the interest 
rate on loans to households for house purchase 
in Germany has been stronger, to a statistically 
significant degree, since May 2022 than histor -
ical correlations would suggest (see the chart 
on p. 48). Another reason why this is striking is 
that –  as was the case with loans to enter -
prises – it coincided with a shift in volumes to -
wards loans with very short interest rate fix -
ation periods, which were cheaper during this 
period than those with longer interest rate fix -
ation periods. Absent this shift in volumes, the 
upside deviation of the interest rate from the 
historical pattern would have been greater still. 
The euro area, meanwhile, saw no notable de -
viations from the usual interest rate pass-  
through patterns.
As mentioned above, the earlier and stronger 
increase in the interest rate on loans to house -
holds for house purchase in Germany com -
pared with the euro area is attributable, first 
and foremost, to the fact that the share of new 
loans with an interest rate fixation period of 
over one year is higher in Germany than in the 
euro area as a whole. Longer- term market 
interest rates –  the developments of which 
banks in Germany are guided by when adjust -
ing the lending rate  – rose earlier and more 
sharply in comparison with shorter- term mar -
ket interest rates in the first half of 2022 (see 
the chart on p. 42). In this respect, the upward 
movement in the interest rate in Germany is 
also an expression that interest rate pass-  
through is generally working in line with histor -
ical relationships.
But why was the increase in interest rates in 
this segment not only stronger in Germany 
than in the euro area, but also stronger from 
May 2022 onwards than historical patterns 
would have suggested? First of all, it should be 
pointed out that banks significantly raised the 
interest rate on loans to households for house purchase with a long interest rate fixation 
period, in particular.17 This interest rate had 
previously been lowered to a particularly sig -
nificant degree in Germany during the period 
of negative interest rates. The BLS results sug -
gest that banks’ changed rate-  setting behav -
iour during both periods relate to the unusual 
developments in the residential real estate mar -
ket. According to the BLS, borrower- side risks 
in connection with loans to households for 
house purchase in Germany increased consid -
erably over the course of 2022 against a back -
drop of high inflation and intense uncertainty 
overall. This drove up borrowing costs to a par -
ticular extent. In line with this, the BLS results 
also show that the tightening of credit stand -
ards for loans to households for house pur -
chase in Germany, primarily on account of in -
creased risks, was more extensive than in the 
euro area.18 The marked deterioration in the 
outlook for the German residential real estate 
market, including uncertainty surrounding fu -
ture price developments, as well as the decline 
in borrowers’ creditworthiness contributed to 
this. Potential overvaluations of residential real 
estate in Germany probably also played a role 
here.19 However, the strong tightening in Ger -
many is put into perspective when it is com -
pared with the spells of easing in the previous 
decade, which was when the significant reduc -
tions in lending rates mentioned above came 
about.Interest rate

The infl  uence of borrower- related and loan- related factors 
on the interest rate on bank loans to non- fi  nancial 
 corporations
The interest rate on a bank loan depends 
on many factors. The most relevant factor 
for the variation in lending rates over time is 
probably the general level of interest rates. 
In a cross- sectional analysis – i.e. across 
loans granted at the same point in time – 
the variation in lending rates can potentially 
be explained by numerous factors. In broad 
terms, these can be broken down into 
bank- related, borrower- related and loan- 
related factors. A suitable way of empiric-
ally analysing the infl  uence exerted by these 
factors is to look at loan- level micro data.
The analysis described here uses loan- level 
micro  data from the AnaCredit credit data 
statistics. They are used to examine the im-
pact of borrower- related and loan- related 
factors on the interest rates on bank loans 
to non- fi  nancial corporations.1 Particular at-
tention is paid to the question of whether 
the infl  uence of these factors has changed 
since the beginning of the current monet-
ary policy tightening cycle. The estimation 
therefore covers the period from the fourth 
quarter of 2021 to the fi  rst quarter of 2023. 
It comprises around 220,000 observations.2
In the econometric estimation, the lending 
rate (as a percentage per annum) serves as 
the dependent variable. Explanatory loan- 
related variables are the maturity of the 
loan and the length of the initial interest 
rate fi  xation period in years, the loan 
amount (in euro, logarithmic), the degree 
of collateralisation (as a percentage of the 
loan amount), whether any assets other 
than collateral could be seized,3 the type of 
repayment, the purpose of the loan (such 
as working capital loan or construction in-
vestment), and the type of loan (such as 
credit line or leasing). Explanatory borrower- related variables are the borrower’s number 
of employees (logarithmic), sector, and 
probability of default (as a percentage). In 
addition, fi  xed effects at the bank- month 
level are included in the estimation. These 
capture bank- related and time- specifi  c fac-
tors.4 Furthermore, the explanatory vari-
ables are interacted with binary variables 
that assume a value of 1 for a given quarter 
and 0 for all other quarters. In this way, the 
effect of an explanatory variable can vary 
from quarter to quarter.
The results of the estimation suggest that a 
longer loan maturity is usually associated 
with a lower lending rate (see the table on 
p. 54). Likewise, the lending rate falls as the 
loan amount increases. Both of these rela-
tionships could be linked to the fact that a 
bank incurs fi  xed costs when granting a 
1 For an analysis of the role of bank- related factors in 
interest rates on loans to non- fi  nancial corporations 
based on AnaCredit data, see Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2022a), especially pp. 29 ff.
2 Loans to enterprises from the sub- sector “Wholesale 
and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles and 
motorcycles” were not included in the sample used for 
the estimation; see Deutsche Bundesbank (2022a), es-
pecially pp. 29 ff. In addition, no loans with volumes of 
less than €5,000 were included in the estimation.
3 All nominal variables are encoded into binary vari-
ables with a value of either 0 or 1 (dummy variables). 
This includes variables that assume a value of “yes” or 
“no”. It also applies to variables that can have several 
nominal values. For each value (with the exception of 
a reference value relative to which the estimated ef-
fects are to be interpreted), a dummy variable indicat-
ing whether or not the variable corresponds to this 
value is then added to the estimation.
4 In formal terms, the estimation equation can be rep-
resented as follows: Ri,b,e,m = γb,m + β’1Li + β’2BRe,m 
+ εi,b,e,m. Here, Ri,b,e,m is the interest rate on loan i 
from bank b to enterprise e in month m, γb,m is a fi  xed 
effect at the bank- month level, Li and BRe,m are vec-
tors containing loan- related and borrower- related vari-
ables, β’1 and β’2 are vectors with estimated coeffi   -
cients that describe the infl  uence of these variables, 
and εi,b,e,m is an error term. The error terms are clus-
tered at the enterprise level when calculating the 
standard deviations of the estimated coeffi   cients.Deutsche Bundesbank

loan. These costs can be distributed over a 
longer period of time if the maturity of the 
loan is longer. Similarly, the markup on the 
lending rate needed to recoup these costs is 
lower if the costs are distributed across a 
larger loan amount.
A longer interest rate fi  xation period tends 
to be associated with a higher lending rate. 
In particular, the coeffi   cients for the second 
and third quarters of 2022, when the yield 
curve was steep, exhibit high positive values 
in the estimation. By contrast, for the fi  rst 
quarter of 2023, in which an inverse yield 
curve was observed, the coeffi   cient turns 
negative. The analysis using loan- level micro 
data therefore confi  rms that developments 
in the yield curve are a relevant factor in the 
pricing of new loans.
Furthermore, a higher degree of collaterali-
sation is associated with a lower lending 
rate, although this effect is not statistically 
signifi  cant in every quarter. By contrast, a 
higher probability of default on the part of 
the borrower results in a higher lending 
rate. Both of these results are intuitively 
clear: a higher degree of collateralisation 
should, all other things being equal, reduce 
the loss suffered by the bank in the event of 
a default by the borrower. If the probability 
of default is higher, the bank will demand a 
higher risk premium.The size of the borrower –  measured in 
terms of its number of employees – is nega-
tively correlated with the lending rate in 
some quarters. This could be because large 
enterprises are generally more transparent 
than small enterprises. Information asym-
metries between the bank and the bor-
rower may therefore be less relevant in the 
case of large enterprises. However, this ef-
fect does not appear to play an especially 
large role if borrower- related risks are al-
ready captured by the probability of de-
fault.5
In addition, the results of the estimation 
show that, up to the third quarter of 2022, 
working capital loans were cheaper than 
other loans. From the fourth quarter of 
2022 onwards, this relationship disappears. 
This may refl  ect banks’ response to higher 
demand for such loans (see the main text): 
owing to higher demand, banks may have 
raised the interest rates they charge for 
working capital loans as compared to other 
loans.
5 It should be noted that the probability of default is 
not available for all borrowers. It is available primarily 
for larger enterprises. Since observations are only in-
cluded in the sample used for the estimation if the 
probability of default is available, large enterprises are 
overrepresented in this sample compared with the 
overall population.Direction of the effect of various variables on the lending rate*

Interest rates on customer 
deposits
Development of deposit rates: 
comparison of periods of 
 monetary policy tightening as 
from 2005 and as from 2022
Interest rates on customer deposits developed 
differently in the individual deposit categories 
(see the chart on p. 41). During the period of 
negative interest rates, the interest rate on 
overnight deposits by households aggregated 
across all banks was very close to zero in Ger -
many and the euro area alike. The rate on non- 
financial corporations’ overnight deposits was 
just below this figure. After negative remuner -
ation on the Eurosystem’s deposit facility came 
to an end in July 2022, banks on aggregate 
raised the interest rate on overnight deposits 
for both categories of depositors back into 
positive territory in September 2022. Since 
then, however, banks have increased the inter -
est rate on overnight deposits only very moder -
ately in both Germany and the euro area. The 
picture was similar for savings deposits –  an -
other deposit category in which banks have 
raised the interest rate only slightly thus far.20 
Time deposits are a different story: interest 
rates on enterprises’ and households’ time de -
posits rose considerably and also significantly 
earlier than they did in the case of overnight 
deposits, starting from the second quarter of 
2022. The steep increase went hand in hand 
with the rapid tightening of monetary policy 
since 2022 (see the chart on p. 44). By way of 
comparison, in the tightening period as from 
2005, banks were slower to raise the interest 
rate on time deposits because the monetary 
policy tightening was also more moderate. The 
interest rate on overnight deposits, by contrast, 
was raised only very slowly and only marginally 
in both tightening periods, fairly independently 
of the monetary policy interest rate hikes.The relationship between 
 deposit types and deposit 
rates
The interest rate differential between longer-  
term deposits (time deposits) and overnight de -
posits in Germany was close to zero during the 
period of negative interest rates up to 2019. It 
even dipped into negative territory in 2020 and 
2021, as enterprises’ time deposits were nega -
tively remunerated on aggregate. This pushed 
the average remuneration of time deposits 
across households and non- financial corpor -
ations into the red as well, leaving it lower than 
the average interest rate on overnight deposits. 
When banks started to rapidly raise the interest 
rate on time deposits in mid- 2022 – but did not 
do the same with the interest rate on overnight 
deposits – the interest rate differential widened 
in line with the steepening yield curve in the 
market.
The interest rate differential between the indi -
vidual deposit categories also had an impact on 
volume growth in each category: if the interest 
rate differential is small, there is little reason for 
bank customers to invest their money as 
longer- term deposits. If in doubt, they will opt 
for a more liquid deposit category. If the inter -
est rate differential turns negative, depositors 
will have a greater tendency to reallocate their 
deposits. For example, the period of negative 
interest rates saw more and more time deposits 
being shifted into overnight deposits. These re -
allocations went into reverse after banks dis -
tinctly raised their interest rate on time deposits 
again. Since September 2022, time deposits as 
a percentage of total deposits have increased 
significantly in both Germany and the euro 
area as a whole.Interest rate

20 Savings deposits exist only in some countries, including 
Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands. The higher 
interest rate on savings deposits in the euro area is attribut -
able to the popular “livret A/ livret bleu” type of savings de -
posits in France, the interest rate on which is regulated by 
the government and is relatively high; see Banque de 
France (2023b). In the past, this rate was adjusted in three- 
month cycles. Recently, it has been adjusted on a monthly 
basis.Deutsche Bundesbank

Transmission of changes 
in market interest rates to 
 deposit rates
The question with interest rates on customer 
deposits, just as it was in the case of lending 
rates, is whether banks’ rate- setting behaviour 
has been unusual since monetary policy tight -
ening commenced. The remuneration that 
banks pay on customer deposits is likewise gen -
erally based on movements in market interest 
rates.21 The same empirical analytical methods 
used to investigate interest rate pass- through to 
lending rates can be used to explore this rela -tionship.22 The historical patterns identified by 
these models indicate that interest rate pass-  
through to overnight deposits is relatively slug -
gish and incomplete. This may be related to the 
fact that overnight deposits are held less for in -
vestment and more for payment purposes, 
meaning they are seen as a substitute for non- 
interest- bearing cash (liquidity reserve).23 Unlike 
with overnight deposits, changes in the refer -
ence interest rate are usually passed through to 
the deposit rate on time deposits not only 
quickly but also almost completely, as these de -
posits are in competition with other longer-  
term investment opportunities.
Since the beginning of 2022, the actual interest 
rate on time deposits has moved largely as ex -
pected from the model (see the chart on p. 57). 
This was in contrast to overnight deposits; 
since the beginning of 2022, banks in Germany 
have raised the interest rate on overnight de -
posits only marginally, despite sharply rising 
money market rates. Much the same applies to 
savings deposits. Therefore, since September 
2022, the actual interest rate in these two de -
posit categories has been significantly lower 
than the interest rate that would have been ex -
pected based on the historical relationship, 
which was itself comparatively sluggish. This 
could be, first, a consequence of the de facto 
zero lower bound that applied to deposit rates 
in the low and negative interest rate policy 
period (see the next section). Second, it might 
be an indication of asymmetric interest rate 
pass- through dependent on the point within

23 The interest rate tends to respond more quickly in the 
case of deposits by non- financial corporations than it does 
for households’ deposits. Differences in households’ and 
enterprises’ sensitivity to interest rates and in the market 
power they wield relative to their bank may be a factor 
here. Moreover, large enterprises are likely to have different 
principal banking relationships than their small counter -
parts. Another factor may be that banks consider it worth -
while to preserve business relationships with enterprises, 
given that enterprises often also make use of other bank -
ing services. The reasons cited above may have different 
weightings in periods of declining and rising interest rates.Deutsche Bundesbank

the interest rate cycle. For Germany and other 
euro area countries, the literature shows that in 
periods of rising reference interest rates, 
changes in these rates are passed on to deposit 
rates to a lesser extent than in periods of falling 
reference interest rates.24 Some authors sus -
pect this phenomenon is driven by imperfect 
competition in the banking sector or interest-  
inelastic demand for banking products on the 
part of depositors.25 Moreover, it appears that 
competitive pressure from foreign banks in de -
posit business has so far been modest. Simi -
larly, no major impact on the deposit rate can 
be expected at present in connection with the 
repayment of funds under the third series of 
targeted longer-  term refinancing operations 
(TLTRO III).26 In Germany, in particular, most 
banks participated in the TLTROs solely for rea -
sons of profitability and held the funds partly as 
additional liquidity. The BLS shows that it was 
mostly maturing debt instruments or loans in 
the interbank market which were replaced by 
TLTRO liquidity, rather than customer deposits. 
Any need to replace TLTRO liquidity with de -
posits is therefore likely to be limited.
However, heterogeneity in the interest rates 
paid on deposits has increased across all banks 
in recent months. This also applies to overnight 
deposits. The quite significant interest rate in -
creases by individual banks are likely an indica -
tion that competition is slowly picking up. Pre -
sumably, many banks are monitoring the mar -
ket closely at present so as to be able to re -
spond quickly to any potential interest rate 
increases by their competitors, thus avoiding 
large deposit outflows. The sluggish pass-  
through of interest rates to overnight deposits 
observed hitherto could pick up momentum 
under the influence of increasing competition.
The impact of rising interest 
rates on the development of 
bank margins
The interest margin in the outstanding lending 
and deposit business27 of banks in Germany contracted steadily during the negative interest 
rate policy period (see the chart on p. 58). This 
is because the aggregate lending rate on out -
standing amounts fell gradually until 2022, 
while the aggregate deposit rate barely de -
clined any further after hovering close to the 
zero lower bound. From the beginning of 2022,

pact on the margin in new business28 because 
the deposit rate had not yet begun to pick up. 
From mid- 2022 onwards, the interest margin in 
outstanding lending and deposit business also 
responded by expanding, although this has 
come to a halt since the beginning of 2023. 
The discrepancy between developments in 
margins in outstanding and new business can 
be explained by the fact that a large part of the 
outstanding loan portfolio in Germany has a 
relatively long interest rate fixation period and 
therefore remains in the portfolio for a long 
time. This is particularly true of the extremely 
low- interest loans to households for house pur -
chase granted up to the end of 2021.29 Changes 
in the deposit rate, meanwhile, affect the mar -
gin in outstanding business earlier because the 
average interest rate fixation period for de -
posits is much shorter. Overnight deposits, 
where interest rate changes are directly re -
flected in the entire portfolio, account for a 
large part of the deposit portfolio. Any increase 
in this interest rate thus immediately puts pres -sure on the margins in new and outstanding 
business.
The interest margin in outstanding lending and 
deposit business followed a different path dur -
ing the last major monetary policy tightening 
phase. After key interest rates began to be 
raised in December 2005, the interest margin 
in outstanding business initially entered a three- 
year decline which lasted the entire length of 
the tightening period. The deposit rate aggre -
gated across overnight deposits and time de -
posits increased promptly and to a moderate 
extent, much as it has done in the recent tight -
ening period. However, the increase in the 
lending rate at that time was significantly 
weaker than it was in 2022, mainly owing to 
the slower pace of monetary policy tightening. 
As a result of the braking effect of the long 
interest rate fixation periods, especially for 
loans for house purchase, the interest margin 
in outstanding lending and deposit business 
declined until the end of 2008. It is quite com -
mon for the interest margin in outstanding 
business to decline initially, as it did from 2005, 
when monetary policy interest rates are in -
creased moderately. By contrast, an almost in -
stant increase in the interest margin in out -
standing business as took place starting in 
2022 occurs only in the case of very marked 
monetary policy interest rate increases or in the 
case of interest rate pass- through that deviates 
from the usual pattern.
If interest rates on loans and deposits follow 
historical interest rate pass- through patterns 
during a period of interest rate increases, both 
the new business margin and the interest mar -
gin in outstanding business widen, the latter 
with a lag. This is because both immediate and 
long- term interest rate pass- through is lower 
on average for deposit rates than for lending … although it is

rates owing to the sluggish and incomplete re -
sponse of the interest rate on overnight de -
posits. The fact that, last year, the margin 
widened earlier than usual in a period of inter -
est rate increases is also due – in addition to 
the pronounced tightening of monetary pol -
icy – to the aforementioned special characteris -
tics of interest rate pass- through in Germany 
during this period.30 The first of these charac -
teristics is that, since May 2022, interest rate 
pass- through to loans to households for house 
purchase in Germany has been stronger than 
historical patterns would suggest. The second 
is that interest rate pass- through to overnight 
deposits, and therefore also to the aggregate 
deposit rate, continues to lag behind the his -
torical pattern, even more so than it did during 
the comparatively moderate period of monet -
ary policy tightening from 2005 onwards. Both 
these characteristics have made the discrep -
ancy in the pass-  through of interest rates to 
loans and deposits widen by more than usual. 
From a bank perspective, however, the add -
itional widening of margins this produces is put 
into perspective somewhat by the increased 
credit risk for loans to households for house 
purchase.
In addition to the reasons mentioned above, 
there is another explanatory approach for the 
fact that banks have so far raised their interest 
rate on overnight deposits only slightly, despite 
the pronounced key interest rate increases. This 
approach starts with an alternative model of 
deposit rates. While interest rate pass- through 
models describe the relationship between de -
posit rates and market interest rates, it is also 
possible to empirically model the pricing of cus -
tomer deposits as being based on a concept of 
a bank’s target margin and thus on the lending 
rates in outstanding business.31 According to 
this definition, banks will base the deposit rates 
they set according to developments in their 
lending rates on outstanding loans in order to 
keep their interest margin in outstanding busi -
ness as steady as possible. This was not pos -
sible during the negative interest rate period, as 
interest rates on customer deposits could not be broadly reduced to a significantly negative 
range without risking a deposit withdrawal. 
However, lending rates on outstanding busi -
ness declined continuously because new loans 
with lower interest rates replaced old loans 
with higher interest rates. Therefore, the inter -
est margin in outstanding business fell below 
the previous normal, which has yet to be 
reached again since. While new loans are being 
granted at significantly higher interest rates, 
the volume of new loans is decreasing, which 
means that the interest margin in outstanding 
business is increasing only gradually. Viewed 
from this perspective, it is again hardly surpris -
ing that banks have not yet raised their interest 
rates on overnight deposits again to any signifi -
cant extent, but are instead taking advantage 
of the low interest rate elasticity of demand for 
banking products.32
Conclusion
The historically unprecedented increase in key 
interest rates has pushed up market interest 
rates and also fed into the interest rates on 
both bank loans and bank deposits in Germany. 
This is consistent with the monetary policy ob -
jective of slowing lending in order to lower the 
excessively high inflation rate to the 2% target 
via falling aggregate demand.
However, increases in bank interest rates in 
Germany have varied in strength and speed 
since the monetary policy tightening period 
began. In terms of historical patterns, it is cer -
tainly the norm for interest rates to be passed 
through to loans more quickly and more 
strongly than to deposits. In the case of loans 
to households for house purchase, however, 
banks have raised the interest rate even more 
strongly than usual since May last year. This 
was probably due mainly to the significantly 
higher credit risk. For small- sized loans to en -Interest rate

terprises, on the other hand, the actual lending 
rate was at times lower than the interest rate 
that would have been expected based on his -
torical interest rate pass- through patterns. The 
increased provision of working capital loans 
with short interest rate fixation periods is likely 
to have played a role in this.
In contrast to lending rates, the interest rate on 
overnight deposits has only inched upwards so 
far. Although such a lagged response was also 
observed in previous monetary policy tighten -
ing periods, since September 2022, the pass-  
through of interest rates has been even more 
sluggish than in the past. As competition for 
deposits gradually picks up and the differential 
between the interest rates on overnight de -
posits and time deposits widens, this is also 
likely to put upward pressure on the interest 
rate on overnight deposits in the future.
The relatively rapid rise in lending rates and the 
stickiness of deposit rates meant that banks 
were able to widen their interest margin in out -standing lending and deposit business. Banks 
have been using increased credit risk to partly 
justify their widening margins since the begin -
ning of 2022. However, increasing lending 
rates can themselves lead to a rise in default 
risks. For borrowers, higher interest rates mean 
a higher interest burden. Owing to their longer 
interest rate fixation periods, this is likely to be -
come apparent at the macroeconomic level 
later in the case of loans to households for 
house purchase than in the case of loans to 
non- financial corporations. Despite increasing 
risks, widening margins in banks’ lending and 
deposit business – which tend to be unusual 
during periods of rising interest rates but have 
been in evidence since 2022 – could be a tran -
sitory phenomenon if competitive pressures in -
crease. As competition for overnight deposits 
gradually picks up, this could mean that the 
previously sluggish pass- through of interest 
rates to these deposits could gain traction, 
meaning that banks’ margins would quickly fall 
again if lending rates do not rise more strongly 
than deposit rates.Interest rate

The growing significance of central 
 government’s off- budget entities
Central government finances map government policy in figures. At their heart sits central govern -
ment’s core budget, which is subject to a transparent and structured process. The government 
proposes a draft budget. Germany’s parliament, the Bundestag, discusses, amends and adopts it. 
The media report on it. The public are able to form a picture of what is going on in terms of fiscal 
policy and central government finances.
In addition to the core budget, the central government has set up numerous off- budget entities 
that perform central government tasks. Central government manages its off- budget entities and 
also bears financial responsibility for them. This means that they belong to the government sector 
and fall within the scope of European fiscal rules for general government.
In recent years, off- budget entities have taken on a much greater significance, with central gov -
ernment shifting tasks over to them on a large scale. When the books were closed for 2022, the 
off- budget entities had scope for deficits amounting to around €400 billion for the current and 
coming years (10% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2023). This is mainly attributable to three 
special funds: the Economic Stabilisation Fund for Energy Assistance, the Armed Forces Fund and 
the Climate and Transformation Fund. The debt brake limits central government’s net structural 
borrowing to 0.35% of GDP per year (€13 billion in 2023); the aforementioned scope for deficits 
held by the off- budget entities is not counted as part of that, however.
Justifications offered for the use of off- budget entities include that they ensure a more reliable 
provision of financial resources or that they can perform tasks at lower costs and in a more tar -
geted fashion. However, clear advantages over the core budget are not always evident in individ -
ual cases. Independent of that fact, disadvantages need to be borne in mind if off-budget entities 
are many and sizeable. Such a set-up represents an impediment to the transparency and govern -
ance of central government finances. Moreover, the change in the way that special funds count 
towards the debt brake means that it is less effective at making sure that Germany sticks to the 
European deficit limit. The debt brake’s binding effect is also impaired if large- scale future expend -
iture in off- budget entities is funded upfront via the escape clause.
All in all, it is advisable to return to a situation where central government finances are more heavily 
concentrated within the core budget in future and to make less extensive use of off- budget entities. 
This might also involve dissolving off- budget entities and integrating their tasks into the core budget.
Independently of this, the government should provide meaningful information on all off- budget 
entities. For the individual larger entities, it should publish information matching the degree of 
detail provided about the core budget and disclose it in a timely manner, covering both current 
budget outturns and annual and medium- term planning. Government updates on prospective 
developments for the current year would also be welcome. An important step in facilitating a 
better appraisal of central government finances as a whole would be for regularly updated plans 
and outturns for the core budget and off-budget entities to be presented together in consolidated 
form. Such additional information on individual entities and the overall situation would signifi -
cantly improve the transparency of central government finances and fiscal policy.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
Central government policy is reflected in its rev -
enue, expenditure and debt. The focal point 
has traditionally been the core budget. In add -
ition to that, central government has set up 
off- budget entities as subsidiary budgets. These 
are closely controlled by central government, 
are part of central government finances and 
belong to the government sector (unlike 
government- owned enterprises). Off- budget 
entities include central government’s special 
funds, institutions, and corporations that pri -
marily pursue central government policy ob -
jectives. Autobahn GmbH is an example of the 
latter. Off- budget entities carry out major tasks 
in some cases and have recently taken on far 
greater significance. Central government is also 
making use of extensive borrowing where 
these subsidiary budgets are concerned. The 
off- budget entities look set to record significant 
deficits over the next few years, over and above 
the standard limit imposed by the debt brake.
This report describes key characteristics of off- 
budget entities and examines their increased 
significance. In particular, it makes plain that 
the existence of numerous off- budget entities 
of different shapes and sizes poses problems in 
terms of the transparency and governance of 
central government finances. It is difficult to 
obtain a sound overview, which is why this art -
icle argues in favour of returning to a situation 
where central government finances are more 
heavily concentrated within the core budget. 
At any rate, the provision of more comprehen -
sive information on off- budget entities would 
be an important step as far as the transparency 
of central government finances is concerned. 
An annex provides an overview of central gov -
ernment’s most substantial – and nevertheless 
numerous – off- budget entities and their key 
features.Core budget at the heart of 
central government finances: 
a structured process and 
 system of comprehensive 
 reporting
At the heart of central government finances sits 
the core budget. It is adopted in a structured 
process that begins with the government de -
ciding on the financial framework (benchmark 
figures) for the four years ahead. This usually 
happens in March. In early summer, once its 
plans have been finalised, the government 
presents its draft budget itemising all of its pro -
posed spending and expected revenue for the 
coming year as well as the aggregate medium- 
term fiscal plan. The Bundestag then deliber -
ates upon the draft budget until November. It 
subsequently adopts the Budget Act (Haus -
haltsgesetz),  thereby approving the total ex -
penditure and borrowing for the coming year. 
An important annex to the adopted Budget Act 
is the budget plan, which details all individual 
items of revenue and expenditure. If it later 
transpires that the spending authorisations are 
not sufficient or that further borrowing is ne -
cessary, the government has to submit a draft 
supplementary budget.1 This basically under -
goes the same procedure as the draft budget.
As the budget is implemented, the Federal 
Ministry of Finance reports on how it is faring, 
publishing figures on a monthly basis. As soon 
as mid-January following the end of the budget 
year, the Federal Ministry of Finance presents 
preliminary outturns. The outturns for all indi -
vidual items are published in summer in the 
budget accounts.
Once all of the figures are available, the Federal 
Court of Auditors carries out its checks. The 
Bundestag ultimately grants the government 
discharge in respect of the implementation of Mounting

the budget. The budgetary process thus takes 
place under parliamentary governance, and the 
general public is also given extensive insight. By 
working under this model, central government 
ensures its compliance with important budget -
ary principles.
Off- budget entities for 
 specific tasks; justification 
important
Central government finances tasks not only via 
the core budget but also using separate off-  
budget entities. These off- budget entities are 
reserved for certain tasks and have their own 
budgets. These are typically mapped out in an -
nual economic plans. In some cases, off- budget 
entities generate their own revenue (such as in 
the case of the Climate and Transformation 
Fund (Climate Fund) where revenue comes 
from carbon emission certificates). As a rule, 
however, the off- budget entities receive grants 
from the core budget. These can be put aside 
for use in later years. When that happens, the 
off-budget entity in question will initially record 
a financing surplus as the funds are injected. 
That will then be followed by a deficit –  as 
funds flow out – until the reserves (the scope 
for deficits) have been used up. In some cases, 
off- budget entities also have their own bor -
rowing authorisations. Ultimately, however, the 
core budget is also liable for these.
Various reasons are given to justify the use of 
off- budget entities. One of those is that they 
offer greater planning certainty than the core 
budget. Specifically, within a given off- budget 
entity, a financial framework is generally allo -
cated on a multi- year basis for a certain area of 
activity. In this respect, there is more protection 
in the event of, say, consolidation pressure in 
the core budget. Insofar as the economic plan 
is determined independently, situations where 
the core budget does not get adopted until 
well after the beginning of the year – as is most 
often the case after general elections – will not 
make any difference. If off- budget entities are less tightly bound to the federal administration 
and its strict procedural rules, there is also po -
tential for cost savings. Furthermore, an off-  
budget entity with exclusive responsibility for a 
particular field can quickly report on fund out -
flows in a comprehensive and targeted man -
ner, focusing on that specific area. Another 
reason for setting up off- budget entities can be 
as a way of fencing off a special task from day- 
to- day political business: an example would be 
the winding-  up of Hypo Real Estate’s financial 
assets, a task that central government con -
ferred upon the bad bank FMS Wertmanage -
ment (FMSW). Off- budget entities are also 
sometimes utilised when central government 
co- finances specific state government tasks via 
larger one-  off payments. It can set criteria for 
the release of funds and thus influence how 
the federal states use the money. The Fund to 
Promote Municipal Investment and the All- Day 
Childcare Fund are two examples here.
However, off- budget entities also present major 
disadvantages, which are directly associated 
with shifting activities outside of the core 
budget. This shift means that off- budget en -
tities are not subject to the budgetary process 
described above, or that it applies to only a 
limited extent. As such, they generally lessen 
parliamentary governance and risk impairing 
the transparency of central government 
finances.2 With off- budget entities, the core 
budget no longer fully reflects central govern -
ment’s revenue and expenditure, making it 
more difficult to see the big picture.3Off- budget

2 Basic principles and requirements for the transparency of 
public finances are outlined in, for example, International 
Monetary Fund (2019).
3 In cases where off- budget entities are designed to facili -
tate the co- financing of federal state tasks, the issues lie 
mainly in the mixing of responsibilities. An alternative ap -
proach would be for central government to transfer shares 
of taxes over to the federal states when it wishes to pro -
vide them with assistance in specific areas. At the same 
time, it could make agreements with those federal states 
requiring them to provide progress reports that give a com -
parative overview of how the tasks in question are being 
carried out. This could eliminate a significant portion of the 
provisions currently responsible for slowing down the out -
flow of central government funds from off- budget entities.Deutsche Bundesbank

Moreover, the advantages over the core budget 
detailed above do not always hold true. For ex -
ample, planning certainty remains limited even 
for off- budget entities, as legislators can make 
significant alterations to their statutory provi -
sions at any time as well (for instance, if funds 
are needed in the core budget). Moreover, cost 
savings do not appear obvious in that, for ex -
ample, ministries manage important off- budget 
entities in the form of special funds and remain 
bound by the procedural rules. Essentially, the 
core budget can often accomplish similar 
things to an off- budget entity.
– Revenue can be reserved for specific pur -
poses in the core budget, too. That is the 
case, for example, for revenue generated by 
the heavy goods vehicle toll, which flows 
into central government’s interstate high -
way system.
– There are instances of earmarked funds 
being utilised on a multi- year basis in the 
core budget as well. In 2019, unspent funds 
for military equipment were not forfeited 
but instead ring- fenced as a special- purpose 
reserve.4 As intended, central government 
then released this reserve last year to pro -
cure military equipment.
– Furthermore, the Federal Government is free 
to publish specific information on certain 
areas of activity if it so wishes – even if the 
area in question falls within the remit of 
multiple ministries; there is no need to set 
up an off- budget entity for that to happen.
Ultimately, the Basic Law (Grundgesetz)  does 
provide for the possibility of off- budget en -
tities. However, the core budget is the central 
element of central government’s budgetary 
planning. To prevent its role from being under -
mined, it makes sense to ensure that off-  
budget entities remain well- justified exceptions 
and do not grow too large.5 Overall, the trans -
parency of central government finances should 
remain intact. It is important that the Bundes -
tag keeps a close eye on government expend -iture, even where it has been shifted outside of 
the core  budget. In any case, the general public 
should be able to access information about the 
off- budget entities with ease.
Off- budget entities with 
 various legal forms
Off- budget entities take various legal forms, 
and their degree of independence from the 
core budget differs. A key feature they all have 
in common is that central government ultim -
ately secures their funding and retains a sub -
stantial degree of control over them. In the 
statistics, the off- budget entities are allocated 
to the general government sector (see the 
annex on accounting and statistical recording 
on p. 76 f.).
The most important off- budget entities are 
special funds (see the overview on pp. 78 ff.). 
They do not have their own legal personality 
and are therefore usually subject to the debt 
brake rules. Specific establishment acts govern 
the economic management of special funds. 
The Bundestag is involved in the adoption of 
their economic plans in some cases but not in 
others. In addition to the establishment acts, 
there are general rules which are intended to 
give legislators an overview of these entities’ 
finances. For example, the Federal Budgetary 
Regulations (Bundeshaushaltsordnung)  stipu -
late that the budget plan for the core central 
government budget should additionally include 
overviews of the special funds’ revenue and ex -
penditure.
Off- budget entities also include legal persons 
governed by public law. For example, the an -
nual economic plan of the Federal Agency for 
Real Estate Tasks is adopted by its Board of Dir -Advantages not

Court of Auditors did express doubts as to whether this 
reserve was compatible with the budgetary rules. See Fed -
eral Court of Auditors (2020), p. 13.

ectors. In the case of FMSW (a bad bank in the 
form of a resolution institution), its Board of 
Directors decides on the resolution plan for 
financial assets. Off- budget entities also include 
a number of federal enterprises in the form of 
corporations.6 One example is the motorway 
company Autobahn GmbH, which is an inde -
pendent private legal person and thus more in -
dependent of central government, while still 
following political instructions.
Alongside off- budget entities, there are other 
entities that have close ties to central govern -
ment but are not included in the general gov -
ernment sector (and are not discussed further 
in this article). These include the Kreditanstalt 
für Wiederaufbau (KfW) and the Bundesbank, 
as public- law institutions. They differ from off- 
budget entities given their status as a bank and 
a central bank, respectively, which entails spe -
cial rules in each case. Central government also 
has quite a number of participating interests in 
private- law enterprises that do not form part of 
the general government sector themselves 
(such as the Federal Printing Works). These en -
terprises cover at least the majority of their 
costs through sales proceeds, and have sub -
stantial operational independence.

The next part of this article provides an outline

all central government off- budget entities on 
which the Bundesbank reports on a quarterly 
basis. First, there is a description of develop -

the turn of the millennium, followed by an out -
look. Then comes a brief overview of changes 
in the off- budget entities’ debt. For more infor -

in its Monthly Reports, see p. 68. The different 
statistical recording of off- budget entities in the national accounts and the government finance 
statistics is explained in the annex (p. 76 f.).

How the Bundesbank reports on off- budget entities
The Bundesbank’s Monthly Report discusses 
current developments in German public 
fi  nances on a quarterly basis (in February, 
May, August and November). These reports 
also include the fi  nances and plans for cen-
tral government’s off- budget entities.1 The 
aim is to gain as broad a picture as possible 
and put developments into context.
First, recent developments in public fi  nances 
are reported:
– Government fi  nance statistics form the 
basis. At the cut- off date, data are avail-
able for the special funds with a poten-
tial for larger defi  cits (such as the Eco-
nomic Stabilisation Fund for Energy As-
sistance (ESF- E), the Climate Fund and 
the Armed Forces Fund).
– The more independent off- budget en-
tities are not taken into account because 
their data are not yet available at that 
point in time. Examples include Auto-
bahn GmbH, which has been operating 
the central government’s motorway net-
work since 2021, the bad bank FMS 
Wertmanagement, responsible for wind-
ing up Hypo Real Estate’s non- performing 
assets since 2010, and the German Nu-
clear Waste Disposal Financing Fund 
(KENFO Foundation) (see the annex on 
pp. 78 ff. for further details and more off-  
budget entities).2 The Federal Statistical 
Offi   ce publishes the national accounts a 
few days after the Bundesbank’s quar-
terly reports, using estimates to plug 
these gaps. Central government’s off- 
budget entities are not shown separately, 
however; the fi  gures refer only to central 
government as a whole.
This is followed by reporting on the plans 
and expected fi  nancial developments of the 
off- budget entities, especially in August 
(when the draft core budget is available) and in February (when annual outturns and 
fi  nalised plans are available):3
– It is not possible to determine the aggre-
gate defi  cit of the off- budget entities or 
of central government as a whole using 
the documents provided along with the 
core budget. Although detailed eco-
nomic plans are available in some cases 
(for the Climate Fund, for example), in 
others only token entries are listed (no 
amounts are given, as in the case of the 
2013 Flood Assistance Fund). For eco-
nomic plans where no amounts are 
stated, the expected defi  cits can some-
times be identifi  ed from the credit fi  nan-
cing overview for the core budget. For a 
large number of off- budget entities, 
however, the documents do not provide 
any budgeted fi  gures at all. From the fol-
lowing year onwards, the information is 
far more limited still: central government 
presents a medium- term fi  nancial plan 
only for the Climate Fund.
– The actual fi  nancial developments devi-
ate, in some cases systematically and 
considerably, from the budgeted fi  gures. 
This applies not only to special funds 
whose economic plans contain only 
token entries but also, for example, to 
the Climate Fund or the Digitalisation 
Fund. In this respect, the economic plans 
seem more a refl  ection of political wishes 
than expected outfl  ows. This is why re-
cent developments often provide a bet-
ter basis for projections than the eco-
nomic plans.
1 Central government does not provide regular reports 
on these.
2 Off- budget entities which, like the Kreditanstalt für 
Wiederaufbau (KFW), are not allocated to the general 
government sector are also not taken into account in 
the reports.
3 See, for example, the summary table in Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2022a), p. 69, and the table in Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2023a), p. 69.Deutsche Bundesbank

moderate in the period from 2000 to 2010.7 
Their expenditure remained below 1% of GDP , 
whilst expenditure in the core budget was 
around 12% of GDP . Off- budget entities also 
accounted for a relatively small share of the fis -
cal balance. They even recorded surpluses up 
to 2005, partly because of Bundesbank profits, 
which were high at times, and return flows 
from promotional loans. By contrast, the core 
budget posted deficits throughout, peaking at 
almost 2% of GDP .
In the financial and economic crisis that began 
in 2008, off- budget entities took on greater 
significance for a time. For example, the Finan -
cial Market Stabilisation Fund (SoFFin) provided 
banks with capital injections, and the Invest -
ment and Repayment Fund provided loans for 
an economic stimulus programme.8
In the years that followed, the off- budget en -
tities’ expenditure fell back to around the pre- 
crisis level. Central government’s core budget, 
too, recorded lower expenditure in relation to 
GDP , with falling interest rates making a signifi -
cant contribution to this. From 2011 onwards, 
the off- budget entities posted surpluses, ini -
tially because banks were paying back the cap -
ital injections they had previously received from 
them. Later, the core budget, now in a sound 
financial position, allocated off- budget entities 
a substantial amount of money, which they did 
not spend in full in the same year. Most not -
ably, central government prefinanced the Cli -
mate Fund, the 2013 Flood Assistance Fund, 
the Fund to Promote Municipal Investment and 
the Digital Infrastructure Fund (Digitalisation 
Fund).
Since the outbreak of the pandemic in 2020, 
the importance of off- budget entities has 
grown again significantly. At first, their ex -
penses predominated, as coronavirus assis -
tance loans to enterprises were financed by the 
newly established Economic Stabilisation Fund 
(ESF). In 2021, central government channelled 
substantial additional resources into the Cli -
mate Fund in particular, most of which re -mained there initially. Central government 
financed these transfers via the escape clause 
for the core budget (see also the box entitled 
“Special funds in the budgetary rules” on 
p.  72 f.). Outflows from the Climate Fund 
(mainly subsidies for cheaper electricity) in -
creased in 2021. However, this merely damp -At start of mil -

7 Off- budget entities such as the German Unity Fund or the 
Debt Processing Fund had played a much greater role in 
financing the burdens associated with German unification. 
See Deutsche Bundesbank (1993). The Treuhand agency, 
which was responsible for the privatisation and winding- up 
of state- owned enterprises, formed part of the corporate 
sector. However, in 1995, its debt – like that of the Debt 
Processing Fund – was assumed by the Redemption Fund 
for Inherited Liabilities and paid off, in part, using Bundes -
bank profits and proceeds from mobile phone license auc -
tions. The remaining unpaid debt was then assumed by the 
core budget.
8 Capital injections by SoFFin were mostly classified as 
financial transactions and thus had no impact on the ex -
penditure or balances in the national accounts. The 
government- owned bad bank FMSW, which is not in -
cluded as an off- budget entity in the reporting group in 
this section, took on assets from Hypo Real Estate at book 
value in 2010. In the national accounts, the difference 
compared with market prices (just over 1% of GDP) was 
reflected in the deficit.Deutsche Bundesbank

ened the decline in expenditure among the off- 
budget entities as a whole resulting from the 
reduced granting of coronavirus assistance 
loans. Overall, upfront funding from the core 
budget in the form of grants very clearly out -
weighed the entities’ outlays. The off- budget 
entities thus posted a substantial surplus in 
2021 (2% of GDP), while the core budget re -
corded a deficit of 6% of GDP .
In 2022, off- budget entities then posted a sig -
nificant deficit amid sharply rising expenditure 
outflows. Particularly sizeable expenditure was 
recorded by the ESF, which was, at that point,  
mainly financing assistance loans for energy 
companies hit by the energy crisis. Further -
more, central government legislators set up a 
separate branch within the ESF for energy as -
sistance (ESF- E) with its own borrowing author -
isation of €200 billion. This authorisation was 
issued via the debt brake escape clause, with 
the energy crisis as the stated justification. Of 
this authorisation, €30 billion was spent on support measures, whereas the vast majority 
(€170 billion) was used to form reserves.9 In 
addition, central government set up the Armed 
Forces Fund, granting it a borrowing authorisa -
tion of €100 billion outside the confines of the 
debt brake via a constitutional amendment. 
The Armed Forces Fund did not record any out -
flows last year.
Substantial scope for deficits
All in all, central government’s off-  budget en -
tities thus have substantial scope for deficits 
this year and in the years that follow. Including 
the reserves of other special funds and the bor -
rowing scope of the Armed Forces Fund, bor -
rowing of around €400 billion (10% of GDP in 
2023) above the standard debt brake limit 
would currently be possible. This will enable Last year, deficit

central government to comply with the debt 
brake rules this year despite planning a deficit 
of €146 billion for the off- budget entities (see 
the chart on p. 69). At €121 billion, the majority  
of this is accounted for by the ESF- E. However, 
the sharp fall in energy prices since planning 
was concluded should considerably reduce its 
deficit. As the law stipulates that assistance 
from the ESF- E is time- limited up to mid- 2024, 
a large part of the ESF- E’s reserves are likely to 
remain unused. Nonetheless, the Armed Forces 
Fund and the Climate Fund, in particular, have 
substantial scope for deficits in the medium 
term.
Debt since the turn of the 
millennium 
After the turn of the millennium, the debt of 
central government’s off- budget entities stood 
at around 3% of GDP (see the chart on p. 70).
Subsequently, central government assumed the 
debt of the German Unity Fund and the Euro -
pean Recovery Program (ERP) Special Fund in 
its core budget. This redistribution meant that 
the off- budget entities’ debt was still relatively 
low when the financial crisis began in 2008.10 
During the financial and economic crisis, cen -
tral government created two new special 
funds, SoFFin and the Investment and Repay -
ment Fund, which then borrowed money. In 
this crisis, however, the debt assumed by cen -
tral government as part of the rescue of Hypo 
Real Estate was far greater in size. In 2010, it 
transferred this debt to its resolution agency 
FMSW, whose debt has fallen again signifi -
cantly in relation to GDP in recent years. This is 
not least because previously acquired financial 
assets were realised and used to reduce debt in 
a favourable economic environment.
Recently, there has been new borrowing, espe -
cially for aid loans from the ESF. At the end of 
2022, the off- budget entities’ debt amounted 
to just over 5% of GDP . In addition, there were 
reserves,11 above all, in the ESF- E and the Cli -
mate Fund and borrowing authorisations in the Armed Forces Fund totalling almost 11% of 
GDP in 2022. These are likely to lead to a sig -
nificant rise in debt over the next few years.
Greater transparency of 
off-budget entities desirable
Fiscal transparency is a key requirement for 
government fiscal policy.12 Without it, it is im -
possible to identify policy priorities and assess 
resultant financing shortages or reserves. Be -
sides central government legislators, the gen -
eral public also has a vested interest here. To 
ensure transparency, meaningful information 
on off- budget entities has to be readily avail -
able, too: both budget outturns (backward-  
looking) as well as plans and expectations 
(forward- looking). This is all the more import -
ant given the recent sharp increase in the sig -
nificance of off- budget entities with very exten -
sive scope for deficits.
At present, the information provided by central 
government fails to fully satisfy these require -
ments. For example, central government’s 
budget plan only contains economic plans for 
selected off- budget entities as an annex. In this 
respect, it is not even possible to obtain a com -
plete overview of the planned overall stance of 
central government’s fiscal policy for the re -
spective financial year. The extent to which the 
Bundestag or its Budget Committee has an in -
fluence on these economic plans is also visible Debt of off-

… which has

10 The core budget had already assumed the debt of the 
Redemption Fund for Inherited Liabilities and other special 
funds in 1999. The decline in the off- budget entities’ debt 
thus does not reflect a reduction in the debt of central gov -
ernment as a whole.
11 In 2022, the ESF- E, for example, borrowed €200 billion 
in budgetary terms and kept the majority as reserves. The 
formation of reserves only includes bookings that are not 
reflected in revenue or expenditure (national accounts and 
government finance statistics) or in the debt statistics. The 
relevant factor for booking here is the point when the re -
serves are ultimately used. That is when expenditure, def -
icits and debt are then booked. By contrast, the use of re -
serves by the other special funds is counted towards the 
debt level of the core budget.
12 This can be seen, for example, in the fact that the IMF 
has drawn up a fiscal transparency code and transparency 
evaluation standards for fiscal management. See Inter -
national Monetary Fund (2019).Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
June 2023

Special funds in the budgetary rules
The design of the budgetary rules appears 
to be a further factor determining how off- 
budget entities are used. The European 
rules address (for good reason) the govern-
ment sector as a whole, and thus include all 
off- budget entities. The national debt brake 
has a narrower target group: it does not 
apply to independent legal entities outside 
of the core budget, even if they belong to 
the government sector (such entities must 
have specifi  c credit limits enshrined in, for 
example, founding acts). Over time, legisla-
tors have, on several occasions, consider-
ably changed the national rules for the spe-
cial funds to which they generally apply. As 
a result, they are now treated differently in 
the national rules than in the European 
rules.
Extensive credit fi  nancing of special 
funds possible prior to debt brake
Prior to the debt brake coming into effect in 
2011, special funds could be exempted by 
law from the credit limit set out in Article 
115 of the German Basic Law. As a result, 
they could be used for extensive credit 
fi  nancing, and indeed were – during Ger-
man reunifi  cation and following the fi  nan-
cial and economic crisis that broke out in 
2008, for example.
Debt brake initially factored special 
fund balances into upper borrowing 
limit
The escape clause for new borrowing au-
thorisations for special funds ceased to 
apply as from 2011 with the implementa-
tion of the debt brake. Henceforth, these 
authorisations were to be factored into 
central government’s structural upper net 
borrowing limit of 0.35% of GDP . Also with 
the aim of safeguarding the European budgetary rules, the fi  scal balance of special 
funds that have no borrowing authorisation 
initially counted towards net borrowing. 
This meant that, taken in isolation, a core 
budget grant to a special fund had no im-
pact on the debt brake, as the resulting in-
crease in borrowing in the core budget was 
offset by an improvement in the balance of 
the special fund. Subsequent payments by 
the special fund then resulted in it incurring 
a defi  cit. While this defi  cit in the special 
fund did not affect borrowing in the core 
budget, it did restrict the core budget’s 
scope for debt under the debt brake. In this 
way, the debt brake restricted the total def-
icit of central government’s core budget 
and special funds.
This provision also meant that central gov-
ernment was unable to use the escape 
clause to create additional leeway in special 
funds for future years. In 2020, for instance, 
the core budget granted €28 billion to the 
Climate Fund, which it used to fi  ll its re-
serves. This had no impact on the debt 
brake: the Climate Fund’s higher surplus 
offset borrowing in the core budget. Bor-
rowing for the grant was therefore not re-
corded as an emergency loan in the repay-
ment plan. Furthermore, any defi  cits in the 
Climate Fund resulting from outfl  ows of 
funds would have correspondingly reduced 
the scope for debt in the core budget.
Inclusion of special funds revised in 
2022
Due to new rules passed at the beginning 
of 2022, the debt brake now only includes 
special funds’ own borrowing. Their bal-
ances are not taken into account. This 
means that a core budget transfer to a spe-
cial fund that has no borrowing authorisa-
tion directly affects the debt brake, but the Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
June 2023  
72

subsequent outfl  ow of the funds held there 
no longer does.
Under normal conditions, the new rules 
have brought forward the point at which 
grants from the core budget for special 
fund expenditure take effect in the debt 
brake (i.e. upon allocation to the special 
fund rather than upon outfl  ow from the 
fund). If the escape clause is used in the 
core budget, however, the opposite is the 
case, i.e. the debt brake then does not im-
pose a limit on emergency loans taken out 
in the core budget. Nor does it take effect 
in the medium term when the special fund 
makes payments. Rather, the debt brake 
does not apply until the emergency loans 
have to be repaid.1
For the fi  scal years 2021 and 2022, central 
government activated the escape clause 
and provided very extensive upfront fi  nan-
cing for special funds under the new rules. 
In a supplementary budget for 2021 passed 
at the end of January 2022, the Climate 
Fund, for example, received €60 billion 
from coronavirus emergency loans. These 
were intended to fi  nance future climate 
change mitigation measures and dampen 
electricity prices in order to stabilise aggre-
gate demand. The Federal Constitutional 
Court is currently examining whether this 
parking of emergency loans is compatible 
with the requirements of the debt brake.2
Furthermore, in 2022, the Economic Stabil-
isation Fund for Energy Assistance (ESF- E) 
received its own borrowing authorisation of 
€200 billion via the escape clause. This is 
intended to alleviate the consequences of 
the rise in energy prices. The fund is permit-
ted to fi  nance assistance measures until 
mid- 2024. Last year, it deployed €30 billion 
for capital assistance to gas trading com-
panies and advance payments for gas and 
district heating (December immediate assis-
tance). The fund put aside the remaining sum without any further constraints being 
imposed by the debt brake. Repayments of 
emergency loans are scheduled to start in 
2031 and be fi  nished by the end of 2061.
In 2022, federal legislators established the 
Armed Forces Fund, giving it a borrowing 
authorisation of €100 billion. This fund was 
exempted from the debt brake by an 
amendment to the German Basic Law. In 
this respect, the budgetary legislators can 
allocate these funds, too, without annual 
limits. A repayment period of 2031 to 2061 
is planned, as for the ESF- E.
Overall, in its off- budget entities, central 
government thus has total additional scope 
for defi  cits of around €400 billion (10% of 
GDP in 2023) beyond the limit imposed by 
the debt brake. The debt brake limits struc-
tural borrowing to 0.35% of GDP per year 
(€13 billion in 2023). The off- budget entities 
will therefore substantially increase the po-
tential for defi  cit beyond this stipulated limit 
for the foreseeable future. Germany’s cur-
rent medium- term budgetary objective 
under the EU rules (including off- budget 
entities) is a structural general government 
defi  cit ratio of 0.5%. In this respect, the 
debt brake is less effective at ensuring com-
pliance with European general government 
requirements.3
1 In another decision, the Bundestag postponed these 
repayments even further. They are now scheduled to 
start in 2028 (previously 2023 for emergency loans 
taken out in 2020, and 2026 for subsequent corona-
virus emergency loans). The Bundestag extended the 
repayment period, which was formerly until 2042, to 
2058.
2 Beyond this specifi  c case, the decision could provide 
guidelines for the use of emergency loans after the cri-
sis situation has ended.
3 Accordingly, the Independent Advisory Board to the 
Stability Council criticised the fact that the debt brake 
does not reliably ensure compliance with the EU rules; 
see Independent Advisory Board to the Stability Coun-
cil (2022), pp. 19 ff.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
June 2023

to a limited extent only. Statistical information 
is likewise incomplete. For example, the na -
tional accounts do not publish separate figures 
for central government’s off- budget entities 
and the government finance statistics do not 
provide any data for earlier years (for further 
information, see the annex on p. 76 f.).
Legislators could better safeguard transparency 
by ensuring that the relevant information is 
made available. To this end, they can rule that 
this information has to be provided for off-  
budget entities. It would be a welcome move 
for central government to: …
– … publish meaningful medium- term fiscal 
plans, at least for major special funds. The 
Federal Government already provides a 
medium- term outlook for the Climate Fund 
in the draft core budget, which clearly sets 
out the Federal Government’s fiscal priorities 
for climate change mitigation in the coming 
years. Such medium- term plans appear to 
have been drawn up for both the ESF- E and 
the Armed Forces Fund as well. However, 
the Federal Government has not published 
these. As these entities likewise have consid -
erable scope for deficits, the fiscal stance 
that central government is planning to take 
each year remains unclear.13
– … ensure budget figures in all economic 
plans for the respective year are realistic and 
complete. This is in line with the budgetary 
principles of complete and true budget esti -
mates. As with the core budget, all expected 
revenue and expenditure items have to be 
included in the planning. In the case of off- 
budget entities, however, there are quite 
often large deviations between planning 
and implementation. For example, in the Cli -
mate Fund, the funds approved for some 
programmes were disbursed to a very limited 
extent. This is easier to accept for new pro -
grammes where uncertainty regarding the 
degree to which they will be used is natur -
ally relatively high. However, this also applies 
to older programmes, where planning should actually be more reliable. Overall, the 
Climate Fund’s programme expenditure 
(spending less bookings to the reserve) in re -
cent years has been more than one- third 
less than the amounts approved. Some older 
special funds do not give any specific esti -
mates for the individual expenditure items. 
Their economic plans therefore do not show 
a deficit either. The deficits anticipated in 
central government’s borrowing plan for 
these special funds are sometimes quite dif -
ferent, without any explanation being 
offered.
– … update fiscal plans at fixed points in time 
to show the impact of changes in develop -
ments and framework conditions. To this 
end, the Federal Government should provide 
both the Stability Council and the European 
Commission with updated projections on 
the agreed dates in the spring and autumn 
– and this applies to the core budget, too.14 
This would, for example, include new en -
ergy price paths for the ESF- E as well as new 
programmes and updated expenditure esti -
mates for the Climate Fund.
– … publish timely and meaningful informa -
tion on developments in off- budget entities 
throughout the year. While the Federal Min -
istry of Finance does provide monthly fiscal 
balances and selected aggregate budget 
data for most special funds, central govern -
ment should also publish data on outflows 
of funds for important budget items, as with 
the core budget. The larger climate change 
mitigation programmes and energy price 
brakes are examples of such items. Said in -
formation makes it easier to gauge the ex -
tent to which the outflow of funds is con -
sistent with the programme plans. In add -Legislators can

13 The Stability Council now publishes a medium- term 
overview of the fiscal balance of central government 
finances as a whole twice a year. However, this does not 
give a clear breakdown showing contributions from the 
off- budget entities.
14 Weaknesses in this regard became particularly evident 
this year. For more information, see Independent Advisory 
Board to the Stability Council (2023), pp. 19 f.Deutsche Bundesbank

ition, the government should provide more 
detailed documentation on the intra-  year 
development of off- budget entities that use 
commercial double- entry bookkeeping. 
Quarterly reports, including key figures from 
government finance statistics, published 
shortly after the end of the quarter would 
be welcome.
– … make it easier to obtain an overview of 
its finances by publishing all the information 
on updated plans and outturns in a timely 
manner for the core budget, the individual 
special funds and in consolidated form. Be -
sides the core budget, this should include at 
least the major special funds, institutions or 
corporations belonging to the government 
sector as well as information on the main 
asset and liability positions. In addition, an 
overview of the outturns for the most im -
portant federal enterprises outside the gov -
ernment sector would be welcome.
Conclusion
In addition to the core budget, central govern -
ment has a whole range of off- budget entities 
that execute many tasks on its behalf. Off-  
budget entities perform government tasks in 
the narrower sense and are part of the govern -
ment sector. They comprise both special funds 
and institutions belonging to central govern -
ment as well as corporations that essentially 
fulfil tasks mandated by central government, 
such as Autobahn GmbH.
For some tasks, it may indeed be worth setting 
up an off- budget entity. However, having nu -
merous large- scale off- budget entities takes its 
toll on the transparency of central government 
finances, with the core budget then reflecting 
only a part thereof. Both the Bundestag and 
the general public thus struggle to obtain an 
overview of fiscal policy and central govern -
ment finances. If, as a result of this lacking in -
formation, it is more difficult to determine 
whether compliance with fiscal rules is given, there is a risk of these rules being weakened. 
Going off budget should therefore only be 
undertaken if this results in clear advantages 
that cannot otherwise be achieved. And, irre -
spective of the specifics of each case, it is es -
sential to constantly review the transparency of 
central government finances as a whole.
It has become increasingly difficult of late to 
keep track of central government finances. 
There are two main factors at play here. First, 
as the number of off- budget entities has 
grown, so has their scope for deficits and the 
sheer volume of tasks hived off from the core 
budget. Second, the information on off- budget 
entities’ planning and outturns is sometimes in -
complete or not easily accessible.
In some cases, it would appear that off- budget 
entities have been set up partly with a view to 
creating additional budgetary leeway com -
pared with the requirements of the debt brake. 
If the current fiscal rules are seen as too ambi -
tious, they should be reformed in a transparent 
procedure geared to safeguarding stability.15 
Meanwhile, the binding effect of the debt 
brake is impaired if, for example, large- scale fu -
ture expenditure in off- budget entities is funded 
upfront via the escape clause. A number of 
federal states have now used this option to cre -
ate larger debt- financed medium and long-  
term fiscal leeway.16 In addition, prefinancing 
from emergency borrowing means that, in fu -
ture, the debt brake will be less effective in en -
suring that Germany complies with the Euro -
pean budgetary rules, as these refer to general 
government deficits, including off- budget en -
tities.
All in all, it is advisable to return to a situation 
where central government finances are more 
heavily concentrated within the core budget in Publish consoli -

Annex: Accounting and recording of off- budget entities 
in statistics on government finances
The different accounting 
 systems used by off- budget 
entities
Central government’s off- budget entities are split 
into entities that use a single- entry accounting sys -
tem and those that use a commercial double- entry 
accounting system.
Just as in the core budget, central government’s spe -
cial funds’ transactions are booked as single entries. 
This means that the accounting system reports an -
nual inflows and outflows (including budgetary 
transfers without cash payments from the core 
budget to special funds). Furthermore, it provides 
data for overviews of financial assets and debt.
By contrast, off-  budget entities that use the com -
mercial double- entry system determine their results 
on the basis of income and expenses – similarly to 
private sector enterprises. This applies, in particular, 
to central government institutions and corporations. 
In this case, it is not investment expenditure, but ra -
ther write- downs and other revaluations that are re -
flected in the annual (net) result. Also, additional 
provisions are set aside on an annual basis for civil 
servants’ pensions accrued in these off-  budget en -
tities. These are generally far higher than the annual 
payments to the precautionary funds made by the 
entities that use the single- entry system (as is the case with the core budget) for equivalent staff. 
Moreover, the balance sheets also comprise a com -
plete overview of real and financial assets, equity 
capital and liabilities.
Off- budget entities in statistics 
on government finances
The results calculated for central government’s off-  
budget entities on the basis of the different account -
ing systems are included in the official statistics on 
government finances. However, they are only shown 
separately in some cases. There are two different 
statistical reporting systems: the national accounts 
and the government finance statistics.
National accounts
The national accounts only show aggregated figures 
for central government finances as a whole. Data for 
central government off- budget entities are not pub -
lished.
The national accounts comprise transactions for the 
economy as a whole, of which general government 
only represents one sector. Not least, the national 
accounts form a harmonised database in the Euro -
pean budgetary rules and are, therefore, of particu -
lar importance. These rules focus on general govern -Differences in

budget entities. The latter also applies to spe -
cial funds which central government uses to 
co- finance state government tasks. In this con -
text, it would be logical to avoid mixed respon -
sibilities and, if necessary, transfer additional 
resources to the federal states as well as to cre -
ate incentives for efficient task management by 
stepping up the comparison of outturns. In the 
other areas, it should be examined whether 
off- budget entities can be brought back into 
the core budget. The aim should be to ensure 
that the core budget again provides a largely 
complete overview of central government 
finances. Moreover, if the tasks were to be bundled to a greater extent in the core budget, 
the Bundestag would be able to manage cen -
tral government finances more easily.
Irrespective of the extent to which they exist, it 
is important to provide transparent, consistent 
and comprehensive information on off- budget 
entities. This includes, amongst other things, 
presenting more detailed budget outturns as 
well as medium- term plans in a comprehen -
sible manner. Regular updates on the outlook 
would be a welcome move. All in all, these 
steps could significantly improve the transpar -
ency of central government finances.Concentration

ment sector deficit and debt, which comprises, in 
addition to the central government (Federal Govern -
ment), the state and local governments and social 
security funds.
The national accounts allocate entities outside of the 
core budget to the general government sector in ac -
cordance with predefined criteria. In most cases, en -
terprises are not assigned to the general govern -
ment sector, even if state- owned. The prerequisites 
for recording them outside of the general govern -
ment sector are as follows: the enterprise must 
cover the majority of its costs from its sales pro -
ceeds, have its own accounting system and be per -
mitted to make decisions autonomously. Otherwise, 
the national accounts consider such entities to be 
general government sector off-  budget entities.17 
Their deficit and their debt are thus counted towards 
the European fiscal limits.
The national accounts data are generally derived 
from the government finance statistics figures on 
off- budget entities (see below). However, there are 
major methodological differences. For example, the 
national accounts do not record revenue from dis -
posal of and expenditure on the acquisition of finan -
cial assets as transactions with an impact on the def -
icit (financial transactions).18
The national accounts figures are regularly updated, 
including for previous years. Data are amended 
whenever an entity is assigned to another sector as 
a result of new information or changes in account -
ing rules. Furthermore, national accounts figures in 
the first releases are still based in some cases on esti -
mates, which are replaced by results collected at a 
later date.
Government finance statistics
Currently, government finance statistics publish indi -
vidual results for all central government off- budget 
entities. However, these statistics comprise only a 
few key figures and are currently solely available for 
2020 and 2021.19 The Federal Ministry of Finance 
provides more detailed and timely overviews, but 
only for individual larger special funds.Government finance statistics map the public sector 
entities to their inflows and outflows. The results of 
the entities that use the single- entry system are 
largely recorded directly from their budget results. 
The accounting system of government entities that 
use commercial double- entry bookkeeping also in -
cludes financial flows. However, government finance 
statistics for these off-  budget entities need to con -
vert some of the income and expenses items into 
payments in order to obtain government finance 
statistics results.
Government finance statistics use the sector classifi -
cation from the national accounts. The national ac -
counts’ government off- budget entities are there -
fore included in the reporting group for the general 
government sector in government finance statistics 
on central, state and local government budgets.
Unlike the national accounts, government finance 
statistics do not regularly or comprehensively revise 
results from previous years. This means that the ag -
gregated government finance statistics result be -
comes distorted (when comparing results over sev -
eral years) when an entity is assigned to a different 
sector retroactively or if it is not included in the re -
porting group until a later stage for some other rea -
son.20 Analyses of longer time series on central gov -

been possible to a limited extent in this respect, and

17 Each year, the Federal Statistical Office publishes a list of 
all general government sector entities included in the regu -
lar data requests for the purpose of transparency. See the 
latest edition of this list: Federal Statistical Office (2022a). 
For the central government subsector, it includes around 
150 entities. Should the classification of a sector be dis -
puted, Eurostat, the European Commission’s statistical au -
thority, may be consulted.

associations), money market funds, and the European Central Bank and national central
banks (the Eurosystem).  1 Source: ECB.  2 In Germany, only savings deposits.

portfolios of securities issued by MFIs in the euro area.  4 In Germany, bank debt
securities with maturities of up to one year are classed as money market paper.5 Excluding liabilities arising from securities issued.  6 After deduction of inter-MFI
participations.  7 The German contributions to the Eurosystem's monetary aggregates

Discrepancies may arise from rounding.  * The banking system's liquidity position is
defined as the current account holdings in euro of euro area credit institutions with the
Eurosystem. Amounts are derived from the consolidated financial statement of the
Eurosystem and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  1 Figures are daily averages
for the reserve maintenance period ending in the month indicated. Following the
changeover in the frequency of Governing Council monetary policy meetings to a
six-week cycle, a reserve maintenance period no longer ends in every month. No figuresare available in such cases.  2 Source: ECB.  3 Includes liquidity provided under the
Eurosystem's asset purchase programmes.  4 From August 2009 includes liquidity
absorbed as a result of the Eurosystem's foreign exchange swap operations.  5 From
2002 euro banknotes and other banknotes which have been issued by the national cen-
tral banks of the Eurosystem and which are still in circulation. In accordance with the
accounting procedure chosen by the Eurosystem for the issue of euro banknotes, a
share of 8% of the total value of the euro banknotes in circulation is

under “Other factors”. The remaining 92% of the value of the euro banknotes in
circulation is allocated, likewise on a monthly basis, to the NCBs, with each NCB
showing in its balance sheet the share of the euro banknotes issued corresponding to
its paid-up share in the ECB's capital. The difference between the value of the euro
banknotes allocated to an NCB and the value of the euro banknotes which that NCB
has put into circulation is likewise shown under “Other factors”. From 2003 eurobanknotes only.  6 Remaining items in the consolidated financial statement of the Euro-
system and the financial statement of the Bundesbank.  7 Equal to the difference bet-
ween the sum of liquidity-pro viding factors and the sum of liquidity-absorbing factors.
8 Calculated as the sum of the “Deposit facility”, “Banknotes in circulation” and “Credit
institutions' current account balances”.

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).

off-budget entities which are assigned to the general government sector.  2 The annual
figures do not tally with the sum of the quarterly figures, as the latter are all pro-
visional. The quarterly figures for some insurance sectors are estimated.  3 The develop-
ment of the types of expenditure recorded here is influenced in part by statisticalchangeovers.  4 Including discrepancies in clearing transactions between central, state
and local government.  5 On the revenue side, this contains proceeds booked as dis-
posals of equity interests and as loan repayments. On the expenditure side, this con-
tains the acquisition of equity interests and loans granted.  6 Excluding central govern-
ment liquidity assistance to the Federal Employment Agency.

* The effective exchange rate corresponds to the weighted external value of the curren-
cy concerned. The method of calculating the indicators of the German economy's price
competitiveness is consistent with the procedure to compute the effective exchange
rates of the euro. A decline in the figures implies an increase in competitiveness. The
weights are based on trade in manufactured goods and services. For more detailed in-
formation on methodology and weighting scale, see the website of the Deutsche
Bundesbank (https://www.bundesbank.de/content/796162).  1 The calculations are
based on the weighted averages of the changes in the bilateral exchange rates of the
euro vis-à-vis the currencies of the following 18 countries: Australia, Bulgaria, Canada,
China, Czechia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan, Norway, Poland, Romania,
Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United
States. Where current price and wage indices were not available, estimates were used.
2 Includes countries belonging to the extended EER group of trading partners (fixed
composition) and additionally the following 23 countries: Algeria, Argentina, Brazil,
Chile, Colombia, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, New Zea-
land, Peru, Philippines, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Taiwan,Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and United Arab Emirates. The ECB has suspended the
publication and calculation of the euro foreign exchange reference rate against Russian
rouble with effect from March 2, 2022 until further notice. For the calculation of
effective exchange rates, an indicative rate is used for the Russian Federation from that
date. It is calculated from the daily RUB/USD rates determined by the Bank of Russia in
conjunction with the respective ECB's euro foreign exchange reference rate to the US
dollar.  3 Annual and quarterly averages.  4 Euro area countries (from 2001 including
Greece, from 2007 including Slovenia, from 2008 including Cyprus and Malta, from
2009 including Slovakia, from 2011 including Estonia, from 2014 including Latvia, from
2015 including Lithuania, from 2023 including Croatia) as well as Canada, Denmark,
Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.
5 Euro area countries (current composition) and countries belonging to the extended
EER group of trading partners (fixed comosition).  6 Euro area countries (current compo-
