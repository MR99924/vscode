5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Economy as a whole
The German economy again experienced
considerable growth in the first quarter of
2007. Overall output rose by 0.5% after ad-
justment for seasonal and calendar effects.
While it is true that the pace of growth
slowed notably in comparison with the final
quarter of 2006 when it was 1%, a number
of special factors played a role here, in par-
ticular the increase in VAT. As a result of the
anticipatory and drag effects, a clear slow-
down in the rate of growth had already been
anticipated at the turn of the year.
On the demand side, the overall value added
to the economy in the first quarter was main-
ly driven by strong investment activity. Enter-
prises significantly increased spending on
fixed assets and have also sharply increased
their stock levels after these had been de-
pleted towards the end of 2006. By contrast,
exports, which were previously dynamic, did
not grow further. This, however was most
likely linked to statistical special effects and
distortions. At a rate of 33/C254%, exports grew
more strongly than at the end of 2006. Thus,
in absolute terms, foreign trade made a nega-
tive contribution of two percentage points to
growth. The purchase decisions of private
households were influenced by the VAT in-
crease. In particular, spending on consumer
durables declined markedly in the first quar-
ter. Private housing construction investments
benefited as a result of the fact that contracts
were agreed before the increase in VAT.

6balance, the state invested much more in
construction during the reporting period than
previously. The mild weather conditions also
supported this.
Industry
After very lively development in the first quar-
ter, industrial activity calmed slightly at the
beginning of the second quarter. Production
fell by 21/C252% in April whereby special effects
were significant. Firstly, the “bridge day” ef-
fect in connection with the public holiday on
1 May is likely to have subdued output.1Sec-
ondly, in April, there were also warning
strikes, in particular at car manufacturers,
which resulted in production losses. If these
special effects are excluded, the decline is
much smaller.
There was also a certain deceleration in the
demand for industrial products which, after a
sharp increase in March due largely to major
orders, declined in April. The bridge day ef-
fect probably also played a role here as ex-
perience has shown that special working day
effects not only affect production but also the
flow of orders. The result for April exceeded
the first quarter average by 1%. While foreign
orders were almost 2% above the quarterly
average, domestic demand, which had previ-
ously increased, remained unchanged from
the first quarter.Economic conditions in Germany*

7In April, the value of exports of goods rose by
1% after seasonal adjustment. This equatesto an increase of
1/C252% on the quarter. In real
terms, the increase is likely to have been mar-ginally smaller. Nominal imports of goods in-creased by a price-related
3/C254% on the month.
The level from the first quarter was, there-fore, just maintained. The trade surplus ex-panded in April by 3
1/C254billion to 3153/C254billion.
ConstructionSeasonally adjusted construction output fell
by almost 3% in April after it had already fall-en in March. This was probably due largely tothe expected technical counter-reaction tothe weather-related high levels in Januaryand February.
According to figures available, after weak de-
mand in February, construction demand in-creased markedly in March by a seasonally-adjusted 4
1/C254%. In the first quarter as whole,
the increase was 81/C254%, with particularly
strong growth in civil engineering. The cyclic-al trend was, however, overstated due to theunusually mild weather conditions during thewinter months. Above all it was the publicsector that placed a greater number of ordersin the first quarter (+16
1/C252%), which was re-
lated to the general improvement in the cashbalance. The number of commercial ordersincreased by 6
1/C252%. First and foremost, this
reflects the high level of capacity utilisation.The demand for housing construction on theother hand, fell by 5%, due in no small part,to the dampening effect of the VAT increase.Labour market
After particularly favourable development on
the labour market during the mild wintermonths, the otherwise seasonal upturn at thebeginning of spring was, as expected, lowerthan usual. According to preliminary estima-tions from the Federal Statistical Office, withan increase of 13,000, employment in Aprilgrew at a significantly slower pace than isusual for the time of year. Taking usual annualfluctuations into account, in April, there wasa total of 39.51 million persons in employ-ment. This was around 539,000 personsmore than a year before. According to initialestimates by the Federal Employment Agency,the number of persons in employment sub-ject to social security contributions rose by34,000 in March. The scale of government-assisted forms of employment barely changedin April. Due to the introduction of seasonalshort-time working benefits in the construc-tion sector, in the first quarter of 2007 thenumber of short-time workers increased from40,000 before the implementation of thescheme to 140,000 afterwards.
In May, the registered rate of unemployment
remained practically unchanged in seasonallyadjusted terms. A total of 3.85 million per-sons were registered as unemployed, approxi-mately 732,000 less than 12 months previ-ously. Unemployment remained at 9.2%, a1.8 percentage point improvement on theprevious year.Foreign trade

8Prices
On average in May, the prices on the inter-
national crude oil markets remained un-
changed from the previous month at
US$673/C254for Brent North Sea Oil. In mid June,
the spot price stood at US$691/C252. On the fu-
tures markets, the premium on the spot price
on six month contracts was US$21/C254. On long-
term contracts (18 months) the premium was
US$31/C254.
Seasonally adjusted industrial producer prices
in April were 0.1% up on the month. Exclud-
ing energy, the price increase was, however,
rather sharp at 0.4%. Owing to a base effect,
the year-on-year rate of increase went down
from 2.5% to 1.6%.
In May, seasonally-adjusted consumer prices
increased by 0.2%. Fuel prices increased
sharply whereas heating oil has recently be-
come cheaper. The price of services as well as
the price of industrial goods (excluding en-
ergy) increased slightly. Food products, on the
other hand, became slightly cheaper. Year-
on-year consumer price inflation (CPI) re-
mained at the April level of 1.9%. According
to the harmonised index of consumer prices,
it was 2.0%.
Public finances2
Excessive deficit procedure against
Germany lifted
On 5 June 2007, the ECOFIN council abro-
gated the excessive deficit procedure againstGermany. The procedure was instigated in
January 2003 after it became clear that Ger-
many had overshot the general government
deficit ceiling of 3% of GDP in 2002. Under
the procedure, Germany was initially called
upon to correct the excessive deficit by 2004.
However, by autumn 2003 it was already evi-
dent that this would not be achieved. The
European Commission then recommended
moving to the next stage of the deficit pro-
cedure, but this recommendation was not fol-
lowed owing to resistance in the ECOFIN
Council. It was only when Germany still ex-
ceeded the reference value in 2005 that the
ECOFIN Council intensified the procedure in
March 2006. Germany was called upon to
correct its excessive deficit as swiftly as pos-
sible and by no later than 2007 as well as to
reduce its structural deficit ratio, ie adjusted
for cyclical and temporary effects, by a total
of at least 1 percentage point over the course
of 2006 and 2007.
The data now available for 2006 and the
European Commission’s forecast confirm that
these requirements have been fulfilled. In
2006, the general government deficit de-
clined to 1.6% of GDP , which was well below
the 3% reference value. The structural deficit
ratio fell by roughly 1 percentage point, and a
further decline of3/C254percentage point is pre-
dicted for 2007. According to the Commis-
sion’s forecast, the unadjusted deficit ratio

9will also fall in 2007 and, after a further slight
decline next year, will amount to no morethan 0.3% of GDP in 2008. Thus, the correc-tion of the excessive deficit was deemed tobe sustainable. While the debt ratio merelystabilised at its peak of 67.9% in 2006, itshould go down to 63
1/C252% in 2008 and thus
approach the 60% reference value.
The improvement in Germany’s fiscal situ-
ation and the subsequent lifting of the exces-sive deficit procedure against it constitute amajor step towards achieving the objectivesof the Stability and Growth Pact. However, itshould not be overlooked that there is stillsome way to go before the Federal Govern-ment achieves its consolidation target of astructurally balanced budget. Until it does so,pursuant to the Stability and Growth Pact, itmust reduce the structural deficit by 0.5% ofGDP (more if the economic climate is favour-able, less in poorer times).
3Accordingly, add-
itional unforeseen revenue should be used toreduce the deficit and not to cut taxes or con-tribution rates or to increase spending. Other-wise, there is a danger that, during the nexteconomic downturn, excessive deficits will re-appear and the debt ratio will rise rapidlyagain.
Statutory health insurance schemeThe statutory health insurance scheme re-
corded a deficit of just under 3
3/C254billion in the
first quarter of 2007.4This amounts to a fi-
nancial improvement of more than 31/C252billion
on the same period of 2006. Total revenue(+5%) rose noticeably faster than expend-iture, although, with an increase of almost3
1/C252%, the latter also grew sharply and, what
is more, at an accelerated pace. As the firstinstalment of the Federal grant – cut from34.2 billion to 32.5 billion for the year as
whole – is not transferred until the secondquarter, revenue was strongly influenced bythe development in contribution receipts.While the rise of almost 5% was caused part-ly by the positive trend in employment andpay, the main effect was due to a higher aver-age contribution rate. At 14.8% (includingthe special contributions by employees andpensioners), the contribution rate was ap-proximately 4
1/C252% higher than it had been
one year previously (14.2%). By contrast, theQuarterly

10total amount of income subject to contribu-
tions rose by less than 1%, and thus far more
slowly than total gross wages and salaries
(+2%). This was due to the smaller rise in
pension payments as well as lower contribu-
tions paid on behalf of recipients of un-
employment benefit II.
In the first quarter of the year, spending on
benefits was up by almost 31/C252% on the year.
This was a far sharper rise than in the three
preceding quarters, which were, to a consid-
erable extent, influenced by the entry into
force of the Act Improving Cost Efficiency in
Pharmaceuticals Supply (Gesetz zur Verbes-
serung der Wirtschaftlichkeit in der Arznei-
mittelversorgung) as of 1 May 2006. Spend-
ing on pharmaceuticals was the main factor
here (+41/C252%) as pharmaceuticals were par-ticularly affected by the VAT increase at the
start of 2007. Similarly sharp rises were re-
corded in spending on dental treatment. The
normalisation of healthcare utilisation behav-
iour following the introduction of fixed sub-
sidies for dentures on 1 January 2005 con-
tinued to play a role here. The similarly sharp
rises in spending on out-patient treatment
(+3%) were probably due to the fact that cer-
tain benefit components are no longer sub-
ject to budget caps. In the case of hospital
treatment, expenditure rose by less than 1%
on the year. However, in 2006 there had been
a very sharp increase in this area, which
means that somewhat higher growth rates
may be expected in the remainder of the
year. Ultimately, however, it should be borne
in mind that, in the preliminary financial stat-
istics, the first quarter still largely rests on esti-
mates and that any projections on this basis
harbour uncertainties.
In 2007 as a whole, the health insurance insti-
tutions are facing both a 31.7 billion cut in
the Federal grant and additional expenditure
of almost 31 billion as a result of the VAT in-
crease. Nevertheless, the sharp increases in
the contribution rates at the start of the year,
the growth in gross wages and salaries,
which looks set to accelerate as the year
progresses, and the positive pension adjust-
ment in mid-year will probably mean that
revenue will rise almost as quickly as expend-
iture so that a significant surplus can once
again be expected. However, this will also be
needed to cut back the debts which some
institutions still have and to top up the re-
serves to the statutory minimum of 0.25 of
monthly expenditure. A degree of uncertaintyQuarterly

11is created by the Act to promote competition
among statutory health insurance institutions
(GKV-Wettbewerbsst/C228rkungsgesetz), which
entered into force as of 1 April 2007 and pro-
vides for more extensive scope to set tariffs.
On balance, it is possible that the effective
average contribution rate will go down again
in the course of the year.
Public long-term care insurance scheme
In the first quarter of 2007, the long-term
care insurance scheme rung recorded a typ-
ical deficit for the time of year (just over 31/C254
billion). The surplus recorded in the prelimin-
ary quarterly statistics for the first quarter of
2006 was due entirely to one-off additional
revenue arising from the earlier transfer of
contributions. Contribution receipts fell by
8% on the year as a result of this base effect.
All in all, however, with the contribution rate
remaining unchanged, the long-term care in-
surance institutions benefited from a notice-
able rise in wages and salaries. By contrast,
spending on benefits – which are set at a
nominal fixed rate per long-term care case –
continued to go up steadily owing to the ris-
ing number of long-term care recipients and
the increasing weight of the more expensive
non-financial benefits. Despite the favourable
economic trend, the possibility that the long-
term care insurance scheme will record a def-
icit for 2007 as a whole cannot be ruled out.
At the end of March, the liquid reserves
amounted to 331/C254billion.Securities markets
Bond market
In April 2007, debt securities with a market
value of 388.0 billion were issued in the Ger-
man bond market. Redemptions amounted
to371.1 billion. Thus, after taking account of
changes in issuers’ holdings of their own
bonds, German borrowers raised a net 38.7
billion in the domestic market. In addition,
foreign debt securities worth 39.0 billion
were purchased; around half of these secur-
ities were denominated in euro. Funds raised
in the German bond market in April, at 317.7
billion in total, were down on the month
(332.8 billion).
Among domestic borrowers, credit institu-
tions were once again the largest group of is-
suers during the month under review; they
drew on the capital market to the amount of
34.9 billion. They focused on sales of other
bank debt securities ( 38.2 billion) but also
sold debt securities issued by specialised
credit institutions and mortgage Pfandbriefe
(31.4 billion and 31.1 billion respectively). By
contrast, the volume of public Pfandbriefe
outstanding declined ( 35.8 billion).
The public sector increased its capital market
debt by 34.7 billion in April. Central govern-
ment issued debt securities worth 33.2 bil-
lion; these were primarily two-year Federal
Treasury notes (Sch/C228tze) and ten-year Bunds
(33.5 billion and 31.6 billion respectively).
By contrast, it redeemed 30-year Bunds and
five-year Federal notes (Bobls) to the value of
31.3 billion and 30.5 billion respectively. TheDeficit in the

Foreign investors were the main purchasers
of debt securities in April, building up their
German bond portfolios by 325.4 billion.
Domestic credit institutions concentrated
their bond purchases ( 37.3 billion) on foreign
paper. German non-banks sold debt securities
for a total of 315.0 billion while purchasing a
small amount of foreign instruments.Equity market
German enterprises issued new shares worth
31.1 billion in the domestic equity market in
March, 30.9 billion of which was attributable
to listed instruments. By contrast, German in-
vestors sold foreign equities worth 35.1 bil-
lion. On the buyer’s side, credit institutions
purchased a significant amount of shares
(329.5 billion), most of which, probably as in
previous years, were sold by foreign investors
in the run-up to dividend payments. German
non-banks also sold shares to the value of
34.4 billion.
Mutual fund shares
In April, domestic mutual funds saw inflows
of34.1 billion, most of which accrued to spe-
cialised funds which are open only to institu-
tional investors ( 33.9 billion net). In the case
of mutual funds open to the general public,
mixed securities-based funds and open-end
real estate funds raised 31.9 billion and 30.4
billion respectively. However, there were out-
flows of funds in the case of bond-based
funds ( 31.1 billion), share-based funds ( 30.5
billion) and money market funds ( 30.4 bil-
lion). Shares in foreign mutual funds were
sold in the German market for a net 36.0 bil-
lion.
As usual, the main purchasers here were Ger-
man non-banks ( 38.7 billion), whereas banks
and foreign investors purchased only relative-
ly small amounts ( 30.5 billion and 30.9 billion
respectively).Sales and purchases

13Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur-
plus – in unadjusted terms – of 39.6 billion in
April, down 38.0 billion on the previous
month’s level. This can be attributed, in part,
to a smaller trade surplus, as is quite typical at
this time of year. Another contributory factor
was an increase in the deficit on invisible cur-
rent transactions, which comprise services,
income and current transfers.
According to provisional figures from the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, the foreign trade bal-
ance in April went down by 33.5 billion on
the month to 315 billion. However, after ad-
justment for seasonal and calendar variations,
it increased by 31/C254billion to 3153/C254billion. The
value of exports of goods rose by 1%. The
growth in nominal imports, which was solely
due to prices, was somewhat weaker at3/C254%.
Compared with the average of the first quar-
ter, seasonally adjusted earnings from exports
increased by1/C252%, whereas import values
barely maintained their level.
Invisible current transactions showed a deficit
of34.3 billion in April, compared with a sur-
plus of 30.4 billion in March. This was due to
a deterioration in two sub-accounts. Cross-
border income ran a deficit of 30.6 billion in
April compared with a surplus of 33.0 billion
in the previous month. The main reason for

14There were again net capital exports resulting
from cross-border portfolio investment in
April. At 312.7 billion, these were somewhat
greater than the first-quarter average ( 311.9
billion). Even so, at 38.6 billion, German resi-
dents invested considerably less in foreign
securities than in the previous few months. In
particular, their interest in foreign debt secur-
ities fell sharply ( 39.0 billion, compared with
323.4 billion in March). While shares – as in
March – were sold ( 36.4 billion), German in-
vestors purchased foreign mutual fund shares
in the amount of 36.0 billion. The overall ef-
fect was reinforced by non-residents reducing
their portfolio holdings in Germany by 34.1
billion net in April (after purchases worth
35.4 billion in the previous month). As in pre-
vious years, they sold German shares ( 330.4
billion) in the run-up to the dividend payment
dates but purchased debt securities for 325.4
billion. Non-residents purchased public and
private bonds worth around 310 billion in
each case.
Net capital exports also resulted from direct
investment ( 36.0 billion). This was due pri-marily to transactions by resident firms,
which made funds of 38.5 billion available to
their affiliates abroad. Foreign proprietors
invested 32.5 billion in Germany in April,
mainly in the form of equity capital.
Other statistically recorded investment, which
comprises financial and trade credits as well
as bank deposits and other assets, resulted in
net capital imports of 37.7 billion in April.
General government transferred funds
abroad ( 32.1 billion), while the operations
of enterprises and households with non-
residents were in balance. By contrast, 39.8
billion accrued to the banking system, whose
unsecuritised foreign payments can largely
be seen as a reflection of other cross-border
transactions. Outflow of funds at the
credit institutions ( 33.2 billion) contrasted
with a reduction of 313.0 billion in the
Bundesbank’s claims, in particular through
TARGET.
The Bundesbank’s reserve assets rose – at
transaction values – by 31.2 billion in April.Portfolio

15Investment and
financing in 2006After several years of fairly low invest-
ment, fixed asset formation increased
considerably in 2006, particularly on
the part of enterprises. At the same
time, profitability improved signifi-
cantly, something which was reflected
in a sharp increase in corporate sector
savings in the macroeconomic ac-
counts. This has also contributed to an
improvement in the financial situation
of German enterprises, despite the re-
newed increase in borrowing. The fi-
nancial situation of households also
continued to change for the better last
year. The financial and non-financial
assets of this sector rose to just over 39
trillion in 2006, not least as a result of
increased investment in housing con-
struction, whereas debt practically
stagnated, at 511/C252trillion. This con-
trasts to a certain extent with develop-
ments in some of the other western in-
dustrial countries, where households’
liabilities, particularly those resulting
from housing loans, have increased
sharply in recent years.
This article gives an overview of the
latest national accounts and flow-of-
funds account statistics for 2006. The
detailed figures are printed in the ap-
pended tables.

16Aggregate fixed asset formation and
saving
Aggregate fixed asset formation increased
significantly in 2006. According to the latest
revised figures of the Federal Statistical Of-
fice’s national accounts, the net investment
of all sectors went up by 326 billion to 376
billion. As a result, the aggregate investment
ratio showed its first rise for some time,
going up from 2.7% to 3.9% of disposable
income. At just under one-tenth of income,
the ratio had been much higher on average
during the 1990s, however.
Non-financial corporations1alone accounted
for net investment of 3431/C252billion in 2006,
which was over 315 billion more than in the
previous year. At the same time, households
invested 3381/C252billion net, around 39 billion
more than a year earlier. The rise can be at-
tributed primarily to an increase in construc-
tion activity. By contrast, the non-financial
assets of the general government sector
showed a further decrease. Although its
gross investment expenditure went up slightly
for the first time since 2004 to just over 332
billion, this was more than offset by depreci-
ation of around 336 billion.
For some years now, saving in the domestic
sectors has been considerably higher than
real investment. Saving went up by around
355 billion to 3200 billion, or just over 10%
of disposable income, in 2006, matching the
previous record set in 1991. The large domes-
tic saving surplus over net investment, which
has shown a marked rise but is still much
lower, gives rise to the German economy’spositive current account balance, which, ac-
cording to national accounts data, stood at
3124 billion last year. As usual, households
accounted for the largest part of domestic
saving, although, at 3160 billion, there was
only a below-average increase (of 321/C252bil-
lion) in private saving. Households’ saving
ratio therefore remained unchanged in 2006,
at 10.6% of their disposable income.
Consequently, developments in the other sec-
tors of the German economy were the main
reason for the marked rise in overall saving,
especially the strong growth in corporate
profits and the successful reduction in deficits
in the area of public finances. For example,
enterprises were able to retain profits
amounting to 334 billion in 2006, exceeding
the already high figure of the previous year
by almost 320 billion.2At the same time,
sharply rising tax receipts and a moderate
growth in government consumption expend-
iture led to the “savings deficit” (including
net capital transfers made) in the public sec-
tor almost halving on the year to 3421/C252bil-
lion. Despite the improvement, this still
means that general government consump-
tion expenditure is, to a considerable extent,
being financed via the capital market. The re-
sulting increasing strain on future generations
can be cut back to a reasonable level only by
1Under the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA
95), these include non-financial corporations and part-
nerships, whereas sole proprietorships are assigned to
the household sector.
2According to the information available, corporate
profits for 2005 are likely to be adjusted upwards in the
next revision of the national accounts in August this year,
with the result that last year’s jump in profits will be con-
siderably smaller.Significant

Investment and financing behaviour
of enterprises
In contrast to non-financial enterprises’ in-
creased real investment, their financial invest-
ment, at just over 370 billion, was up only314 billion on the year. According to the fig-
ures of the flow-of-funds account, however,
there were significant shifts in the pattern of
financial assets. Loans granted increased the
strongest. At just over 360 billion, they were
almost twice as high as in 2005 and were
shaped mainly by short-term suppliers’ credits
to foreign firms associated with the buoyant
demand for exports. Producing enterprises in-
vested around 325 billion with banks, which
was noticeably less than in 2005. At 39 bil-
lion, however, there were strong inflows to
longer-term bank deposits. In addition, equity
acquisitions were quite buoyant in 2006; for-
eign equity investment, in particular, in-
creased sharply last year.
On the financing side, the large share of in-
ternal financing in the uses of funds is espe-
cially notable. Owing to the marked improve-
ment in profitability, the resources generated
by enterprises themselves, which include de-
preciation, achieved, at almost 3240 billion,
an internal financing ratio which was roughly
as high as in 2005 (around 80%), despite the
noticeably more buoyant investment activity.
For the first time in several years, however,
the external financing of non-financial cor-
porations also showed a marked rise in 2006;
it came to just over 380 billion in the year
under review, compared with 320 billion in
2005. After the years of consolidation, enter-
prises increased their borrowing from domes-
tic and foreign banks in 2006 to the amount
of315 billion. Bank loans were obtained, on
balance, especially in the longer-term matur-
ity segment, whereas short-term loans were
marginally redeemed in net terms. This
means that the marked shift in the maturityeu bn

20structure of enterprises’ borrowing in favour
of longer-term loans, which has been observ-
able for some time, persisted last year.
In addition, there was an increase in financial
liabilities to other sectors, such as general
government, insurance corporations, and for-
eign enterprises on roughly the same scale as
bank loans as a whole. Of particular signifi-
cance were short-term cross-border transac-
tions, which, in addition to trade credits and
financial loans, include advance payments for
construction orders, which were especially
high in 2006. Furthermore, producing enter-
prises borrowed extensively in the capital
market. The sum of 3151/C252billion was raised
from the placing of bonds, and 341/C252billion
from share issues. Proceeds from cash contri-
butions amounting to 39 billion – with listed
companies benefiting from over one-half of
this – were offset, not least, by a matching
amount of capital reductions and changes in
legal form. However, inflows of own re-
sources from unsecuritised investment trans-
actions were of greater significance, with
roughly 319 billion being received from them.
In the main, these funds were acquired from
abroad.
As a result of the continued increase in the
take-up of equity capital in 2006 and persist-
ently strong profitability, there was a further
improvement in the financial position of en-
terprises in 2006 – much as in 2005. Includ-
ing valuation-related increases, the equity
capital of domestic non-financial enterprises
had risen by some 3250 billion by the end of
2006 to a total value of almost 32 trillion.3
Owing to the renewed increased use of debtcapital, there was a simultaneous rise in cor-
porate debt as well, which overshot the 32
trillion mark for the first time. Nevertheless,
corporate sector debt showed a further
marked fall in relation to equity.
As a result of increased borrowing and higher
market interest rates in 2006, the interest
paid by enterprises went up by around 1 per-
centage point to just under one-fifth of the
operating surplus. Ultimately, however, this is
unlikely to have put a strain on the producing
enterprises’ overall result, as financial assets
generated higher interest to match. At 7% of
the operating surplus, the net interest burden
was considerably lower than the correspond-
ing gross figure.
Within the debt structure of the corporate
sector, financial credits dominated at almost
two-thirds, followed by other liabilities at
one-fifth. Bank loans, which have been losing
ground compared with other financial credits
for some time, had a share of just over two-
fifths of debt capital in 2006. In return, other
lenders, especially those from abroad, which
had tended to play a rather minor role as re-
cently as the 1990s, have firmly established
themselves as “financiers” since the year
2000 at just over one-fifth on average. This is
true primarily of enterprises belonging to a
group. Although receipts from corporate
bond issues were relatively high in 2006 and,
3As a result of the market-based valuation method,
higher equity capital is usually shown in the flow-of-
funds account when prices have increased than in the
Bundesbank’ s corporate balance sheet statistics. For de-

tween the two sets of statistics, see Deutsche Bundes-

21in some cases, in the preceding years, the
share of all debt accounted for by this form
of financing remained very small, at 6%.
Households’ investment behaviour
As mentioned above, households – much like
enterprises – also significantly increased their
spending on real investment in 2006. They
essentially did so at the expense of their ac-
quisition of financial assets, which, at 3128
billion, was almost 310 billion lower than in
the previous year. Regarding the various
forms of financial investment, however, there
were considerable shifts in 2006. The winner
was direct investment in the securities mar-
kets. At just over 380 billion, or around three-
fifths of financial savings, however, banks
and other financial intermediaries continued
to account for the bulk of households’ finan-
cial investment. As in 2005, just over 340 bil-
lion was invested with banks. While fewer re-
sources flowed into transferable deposits
than in 2005 and traditional savings deposits
were, in fact, reduced sharply, time deposits,
the remuneration of which showed a marked
rise, were built up substantially by house-
holds. There was also increased demand for
saving certificates. At just over 350 billion,
however, private investment in insurance cor-
porations and pension funds in 2006 was
somewhat down on 2005, although it was
still in line with the long-term average.
There were markedly smaller inflows of re-
sources to domestic mutual funds from pri-
vate saving in 2006. By contrast, foreign mu-
tual funds shares were purchased on a con-siderable scale. Households withdrew 381/C252
billion net from mutual funds, after building
up financial investments substantially in
2005. The outflows concerned mainly open-
end real estate funds and share-based funds.
The caution in the case of share-based funds
is also reflected in direct share purchases.
Despite the very positive share price develop-
ments in the stock market, households once
again sold shares in net terms to the value of
35 billion. By contrast, there was very heavy
demand for longer-term debt securities.
However, traditional bonds benefited from
this less than certificates issued by banks, of
which there are now many different forms
and which are often similar in character to
derivatives. In total, households purchased
debt securities to the amount of 337 billion in
2006, 328 billion more than a year earlier.
Households’ financial assets and
indebtedness
Overall, households’ financial assets went up
by3225 billion, or 5%, to somewhat over
341/C252trillion in 2006. This quite considerable
increase mainly resulted from the ongoing
saving process, although two-fifths can be at-
tributed to valuation gains, particularly in the
case of equity and mutual fund investments,
whose combined share of the portfolio
amounted to around 20% at the end of the
period under review. Nominal financial assets
per household have therefore roughly
doubled since the early 1990s from just
under 360,000 to 3115,000. If property and

23also taken into consideration, gross private
assets reached just over 39 trillion on aggre-
gate, which – statistically – works out at3240,000 per household. This average does
not, of course, reflect the distribution of theassets across the population. However, it isknown from the Federal Statistical Office’shousehold survey that there is a considerabledispersion in Germany, as in other industrial-ised countries.
Last year, households again reduced their in-
debtedness to a minor extent, as they wereable to finance non-financial and financialasset formation from their own resources.Their accumulated liabilities therefore fell tojust under 31,570 billion. Whereas house-
holds stepped up their outstanding buildingloans with banks and insurance corporationsin the wake of the recent further pick-up inhousebuilding activity, consumer loans and,in particular, commercial loans were re-deemed in net terms. Overall, growth in thehousehold sector’s net financial assets waseven more favourable than the gross figuresuggests. They stood at almost 33 trillion in
2006, which is equivalent to an increase ofaround 3230 billion. Average net worth, ie
total financial and non-financial assets afterdeducting liabilities, came to roughly3200,000 per household at the end of 2006.
Even though German household indebted-
ness has fallen slightly in the past three years,it still exceeded the comparable figure for themid-1990s by 3400 billion, or just under two-
fifths. However, there was a much larger risein some of the other euro-area countries, aswell as in the United Kingdom and the UnitedStates. Within the euro area, there was a very
large increase in debt particularly in Spain,where it increased almost fivefold between1995 and 2006. The rise was considerablymore moderate in the Netherlands and Italy,where households’ liabilities trebled. In theUnited Kingdom and the United States, liabil-ities rose by approximately 160% in eachcase. At a rate of around 80%, lending toFrench and Austrian households was notice-ably slower, but still more marked than inGermany. In all of these countries, the sharpincrease in household debt was due to stronggrowth in housing loans. This, in turn, wasdue to very buoyant demand for property inmany countries, accompanied by a rapid in-crease in property prices. There was a muchsmaller increase in commercial loans to soleproprietors and in consumer credit in mostcases. Consumer loans played a major role es-pecially in the case of UK and US households,accounting for around one-fifth of all out-standing liabilities, which is likely to be attrib-utable, not least, to the widespread use ofcredit cards.
In this international comparison, it should,
however, be noted that the levels of debt,measured by disposable income, differed verywidely at the beginning of the period underreview, and still do.
4At just under 30%, Ital-
ian households had by far the lowest level ofdebt in 1995; it had reached half of their in-come level in 2006. At 50%, Spain, too, was

The very strong expansion in borrowing thereled to a rate of over 130% one decade later.In Austria and France, indebtedness was like-wise fairly low at first, at over half of dispos-able income. By the end of last year, the levelof debt had risen by roughly 20 percentagepoints in both countries. At the beginning ofthe period under review, German as well asUK and US household debt amounted to al-most 100% of income. Some ten years later,debt in the United Kingdom and the UnitedStates had increased to 160% and 140%, re-spectively, whereas in Germany, outstandingloans exceeded the income level only margin-ally overall. Households in the Netherlandshad a slightly higher level than Germany in1995, but had reached a debt ratio which, ac-cording to the data available, came to nearly
250% of disposable income most recently.
Although, in some cases, there has been a
very rapid increase in household debt in thecountries analysed here, the fact that the costof borrowing has been moving in the oppos-ite direction has meant that, since 1995,there has mostly been a trend fall in theirinterest rate burden, which has latterly beenat an historically low level. In the Netherlands,the decline did not start until after 2000,when the pace of credit growth eased some-what. However, there was then quite amarked fall in the interest rate burden ofhouseholds, from 10% to around 7

interest expenditure in 2006 remained un-
changed on the year, at 4% of disposable in-
come; in 1995, the comparable figure was
6%. In the United Kingdom, where floating-
rate loans are widespread and the central
bank has been raising interest rates since the
end of 2003, the interest rate burden has
gone up by 2 percentage points in the interim
to almost one-tenth of income. US house-holds have also had to spend somewhat
more on servicing loans of late. However, the
indicator published in the United States
measures the total debt service burden, ie in-
cluding redemptions, which, strictly speaking,
should be assigned to saving, and the
amount of which may be considerable. In
2006, US households’ average debt service
burden stood at just over 14% of disposable

33Current account
balances and price
competitiveness
in the euro areaCurrent account positions in the euro
area have widened distinctly since the
beginning of the third stage of Euro-
pean monetary union. Whereas the
euro area as a whole has a nearly bal-
anced current account, individual
euro-area countries are running – in
some cases, considerable – deficits or
surpluses. At the same time, major
shifts between member states with re-
gard to price competitiveness can be
observed. The German economy, for
instance, has visibly improved its price
competitiveness. This report analyses
the extent to which these develop-
ments may be regarded as a manifest-
ation of a convergence process. Al-
though the measurement methods
used do not provide any hard empirical
evidence, there are, on the whole,
signs that the identified changes in
prices and wages reflect international
convergence mechanisms yet, in some
cases, go beyond what can be expected
in the context of real economic
catching-up processes.
Diverging current account positions
within the euro area
In a monetary union, national current ac-
count positions have a different status than in
countries with their own individual curren-
cies. Even if they each surpass a sustainable
long-term level, they can trigger adjustments
of the nominal exchange rate for the entire
currency area only in the aggregate. ThereNational

34are also other ways in which national current
accounts are relevant in a monetary union:
for instance, they can provide crucial informa-
tion about a country’s saving and investment
decisions, patterns of competitiveness or eco-
nomic convergence processes. This also ap-
plies to the euro-area countries, which have
seen their current accounts diverge quite
widely since the beginning of the third stage
of European monetary union. For instance,
Greece, Portugal and Spain, at last report
(2006), had deficits of over 8% of their na-
tional gross domestic product (GDP). These
contrast with four countries with high sur-
pluses (relative to GDP): Finland (just under
6%), Germany (5%), Luxembourg (just under
101/C252%) and the Netherlands (81/C252%). The re-
maining countries’ current account positions
are at more moderate levels.
These national balances need to be con-
sidered bearing in mind the fact that the
overall euro-area current account – which
covers transactions with non-euro-area coun-
tries (“third countries”)1– has been largely
balanced in the past few years. In 2006, there
was a deficit of 0.1% of GDP; the highest
levels since the beginning of monetary union
were reached in 2000 with a deficit of just
under 11/C252% of GDP and in 2002 and 2004
with a surplus of around 1% of GDP in each
of the two years.
At the beginning of monetary union, the
three aforementioned deficit countries al-
ready had – in some cases, considerable –
current account deficits. For instance, Greece
(which, however, did not join the euro area
until 2001) had a deficit of nearly 41/C252%o fGDP in 1999, with the corresponding figure
for Portugal standing at just over 81/C252%. In
Spain, by comparison, the deficit at the time,
at just under 3% of GDP , was perceptibly
lower than it is today. A noticeable deterior-
ation in the current account balance relative
to GDP could also be observed in Italy (just
over 3 percentage points), Ireland and France
(just under 41/C252percentage points each)
between 1999 and 2006. All three countries
reported deficits in 2006 despite having had
current account surpluses in 1999 (France
3%, Italy just over1/C252% and Ireland just under
1/C252% of GDP). Moreover, Belgium’s current ac-
count surplus diminished from 5% to 2% in
the reporting period.
The group of countries with the largest sur-
pluses at the current end did not experience
completely homogeneous growth over the
past few years, either. For instance, in 1999,
Finland and Luxembourg already reported
surpluses of over 6% and over 101/C252%o f
GDP respectively. The Dutch current account
surplus was, at that time, still just under 4%
of GDP . By contrast, for Germany – as a con-
sequence of German reunification and the
sharp loss in price competitiveness in the
early 1990s – the current account in 1999
1The euro-area balance of payments statistics cover
transactions between euro-area countries and non-euro-
area countries. Each country’s national balance of pay-
ments, by contrast, comprises the entirety of that individ-
ual country’s transactions with non-residents, ie with
both third countries (extra-euro-area transactions) and
other euro-area countries (intra-euro-area transactions).
As – at times – different conventions are used to draw a
material distinction between the trade in goods in the
euro-area balance of payments statistics and in individual
countries’ balance of payments statistics as well as in the
national accounts, deviations can occur in the data for

35showed a deficit of just under 11/C252% of GDP .
It was not until 2002 that the German currentaccount turned around.
The current accounts of the countries ob-
served are strongly determined by the resultsof trade in goods and services. On averageover the past 15 years, across the euro area(excluding Belgium, Luxembourg and Slo-venia), these transactions have accounted formore than 80% of current transactions (ran-ging from only around 74% in Ireland to justunder 86% in Austria).
2Net exports of goods
and services therefore provide a rather goodapproximation of the individual countries’current account balances. Changes in com-petitiveness – which will be central to the fol-lowing analysis – are likely to be of moremajor and direct importance for trade ingoods and services, too, whereas they areless closely related to the two other sub-itemsof the current account, income and currenttransfers. Moreover, cross-border flows ofgoods and services also allow a closer look atthe external relations of the euro-area coun-tries with third countries (extra-trade) as wellas with their euro-area partners (intra-trade).
3
It has been evidenced that the three countrieswith large current account deficits in 2006also have noticeable deficits in their trade ingoods with both other euro-area countriesand third countries yet are running slight sur-pluses in services transactions with each setof countries.
4For the other euro-area mem-
ber states, by contrast, there are at times per-ceptible differences between extra-trade andintra-trade. The most striking example is theNetherlands, whose large surplus in goodstrade with the euro area contrasts starkly
with its large deficit in extra-trade. These fig-ures reflect the important role of the Port ofRotterdam for international trade and the sig-nificance of the Netherlands as a transit coun-As a percentage of GDP

2For Belgium, the share latterly stood at around 82%;
for Luxembourg, whose current account is strongly deter-
mined by cross-border income, the figure is around 35%.
Owing to the economic union that has historically linked
the two countries, separate unbroken current account
data for these countries are not available for the entire
duration of the past 15 years.
3Whereas the data for trade in goods broken down into
extra-transactions and intra-transactions are also avail-
able for longer past periods, the information on services
broken down in this fashion by region are available only
for a few years (for most countries, only from 2002 on-
wards).
4Travel and tourism played a major role here, as all three
deficit countries are popular holiday destinations. More-
over, it should also be noted that a service breakdown by
extra and intra-transactions is currently available from
Eurostat only up to 2005. The information on trade in
goods is taken from Eurostat’s foreign trade statistics, as
Eurostat does not publish the relevant balance of pay-
ments data.Dominance of

36try. They thus primarily reflect the way in
which imports and exports are accounted for
in the euro area and not so much economic
determinants.5A remarkable fact about Ger-
many is that its surplus in extra-trade in
goods is about double its intra-trade surplus.6
In the Finnish case, the surplus in extra-trade
in goods even contrasts with a slight intra-
trade deficit. Luxembourg’s surplus in trade in
goods and services is marked, both for intra-trade and extra-trade, by cross-border ser-
vices transactions (especially financial ser-
vices), whereas deficits have been reported in
trade in goods.
Since the beginning of monetary union, the
surpluses in extra-trade in goods recorded by
several countries have diminished: Spain (by
three percentage points relative to GDP) and
Greece, but also Italy and the Netherlands (by
2 percentage points in each case). By con-
trast, Germany and Austria have seen their
balances of extra-trade in goods go up by
2 and 3 percentage points relative to GDP re-
spectively. The goods trade of Finland, Ireland
and the Netherlands has seen the greatest
change in intra-trade: Finland’s surplus of 2%
of GDP in 1999 had reversed itself into a def-
icit of just over1/C252% of GDP by 2006 and Ire-
land’s healthy surplus shrank from just under
20% in 1999 to around 13% in 2006. By
contrast, the Netherlands has enlarged its
surplus since the beginning of monetary
union by nearly 6 percentage points to just
over 19% of GDP at last report.

ances of goods and services as accounting
identities allows current account positions to
be assigned to their regional origins. It doesAs a percentage of GDP

37not necessarily allow the underlying forces to
be pinpointed, however. For instance, the
change in price competitiveness relative to
the other euro-area countries will not only
have an impact on bilateral trade with these
countries but will also lead to shifts in the
relative price competitiveness of euro-area
countries on third markets. This indicates that
the overall external position of the countries
should be looked at in the following analysis
of the connection between competitiveness
and the current account; a relatively broadly-
based analytical approach should therefore
be chosen.
Determinants of current account
developments
There are fundamentally different reasons
why current account positions can grow. One
is as a result of greater integration and in-
creasing efficiency in the cross-border alloca-
tion of capital. The economic catching-up
process of individual euro-area countries
plays a major role in this connection. Product-
ivity gains often go hand in hand with higher
than average capital inflows, which are the
flip side of current account deficits. A current
study finds evidence that the capital flows in
Europe can be explained to some extent
against the background of a convergence
process. The relatively advanced state of inte-
gration in the European financial markets ap-
parently allows a greater decoupling from do-
mestic saving and investment than is visible in
other regions of the world, so that capital
from more advanced countries flows to
lower-income countries.7Furthermore, the build-up of current account
positions can also serve as an instrument for
the market to offset asymmetric shocks or
countervailing business cycles. In the euro
area, with its structure of fiscal federalism,
private capital flows may therefore be very
important.8Conversely, a stubborn current
account deficit could also indicate structural
deficiencies that increasingly come to the fore
because the exchange rate is no longer avail-
able as an adjustment mechanism.
The large deficits recorded by Greece, Portu-
gal and Spain have caused a perceptible rise
in these countries’ net foreign debt in the
past few years. The sectoral origins of the
changed external positions are therefore of
some interest. Although the development
patterns vary in details and size among the
deficit countries, what they have in common
is that the private sector has made a notable
contribution to the deterioration in the cur-
rent account. In Spain, as of late, the deterior-
ation in the current account balance was ac-
tually due entirely to the private sector. By
contrast, although Greece has occasionally
recorded large public deficits, these have

finance and income convergence: Europe is different,

authors note the existence of a self-limiting mechanism
whereby, as incomes rise in the recovering countries, this
growth stimulus diminishes in importance. O Blanchard

euro area: The end of the Feldstein-Horioka puzzle?,

saving and domestic investment in the euro-area coun-
tries. A Ahearne, B Schmitz and J von Hagen (2007), Cur-
rent account imbalances in the euro area, draft, March,
also explain the divergence in euro-area current account
positions through capital flows from higher-income
countries to lower-income countries.

38been less pronounced in the past two years.9
In Portugal, too, both the government sector
and the private sector have foreign deficits.
Reduced risk premiums and the easing of
credit constraints following the introduction
of the euro have probably encouraged the
growth of these current account deficits.10
In the countries with high current account
surpluses, the past few years have seen clear-ly positive and, in some cases, rising net sav-
ing in the private sector. At the same time,
developments in government budget bal-
ances have also occasionally been favourable:
in Finland, the government has been running
surpluses for years, while the Netherlands has
been able to run down its deficits significant-
ly, even achieving a slight surplus in 2006.
Germany, too, has been able to successfully
reduce its public deficit over the past three
years.
The price competitiveness of a country’s
economy is generally regarded as one of the
key factors determining its current account
balance. Indicators of price competitiveness
are typically expressed as a ratio of domestic
price or cost movements to foreign price or
cost movements, with trading partners being
weighted according to their significance. All
prices or costs are expressed in a common
currency. These indicators, which are also
termed real effective exchange rates, are thus
determined both by nominal exchange rate
movements as well as by inflation differentials
with other countries: if the domestic inflation
rate is higher than the foreign inflation rate,
this will generally hamper price competitive-
ness, as will a nominal appreciation of the do-
mestic currency. (Indeed, euro-area countries
have not had any (nominal) exchange rate
changes inter se since the introduction of the
euro.) Such real appreciations are generally
likely to worsen the current account. It there-As a percentage of GDP, year-end levels

39fore comes as no surprise that the trends in
price competitiveness among the individual
euro-area countries have empirically been
found to largely resemble those of current ac-
counts within the euro area.
Changes in competitive positions within
the euro area
Indicators of price competitiveness on the
basis of price and cost indices calculated rela-
tive to 19 (and, since the accession of Slo-
venia to the euro area at the beginning of this
year, 20) industrial countries consistently
show, for instance, that Germany’s competi-
tive position improved considerably in the
second half of the 1990s and has deterior-
ated only very slightly since.11Splitting this
type of indicator into two components – a
sub-indicator relative to the current euro-area
members and one relative to the other coun-
tries – reveals that the increase in competi-
tiveness in the second half of the 1990s is at-
tributable particularly to the nominal depreci-
ation first of the D-mark and then of the euro
against key currencies, as expressed in the lat-
termost sub-indicator.
The sub-indicator relative to euro-area coun-
tries, by contrast, has seen nearly continuous
improvement since 1995, especially since the
introduction of the euro in 1999, owing to
the relatively low rate of inflation in Germany.
For this reason, the perceptible recovery of
the euro from its all-time lows in 2000 against
the US dollar, pound sterling and Japanese
yen are reflected only to a lesser extent in the
overall indicator. Since 1999, German com-petitiveness, based on consumer prices for
instance, has strengthened by 2% relative to
the 20-country group and by more than 5%
relative to the euro-area countries. If other
price or cost indices are used as a basis, the
rates of change are even greater. The reverse
can be seen for several other euro-area coun-
tries.
Over the same period, the absolute mean de-
viation of the annual national inflation rates
measured in terms of the Harmonised Index
of Consumer Prices (HICP) across all member
states has been only3/C254percentage point
from the overall euro-area inflation index,
which does not appear very large at first
sight. However, the inflation rates of many
member states have remained higher than
the euro-area average for many years, while
other economies have continuously had
below average rates of inflation. This indi-
cates how crucially important the observed
persistence of the inflation differentials in the
euro area is for competitiveness, with the ef-
fects cumulating over time. Developments in
Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal
and Spain have been characterised by rela-
tively high rates of inflation.12Annual infla-
tion rates in Germany and Austria, by con-
trast, have always been lower than the
weighted average since the beginning of
monetary union. Prices in Finland and France,
too, have increased less sharply than average
in most of the past few years.
11This conclusion is reached irrespective of the price or
cost indices used; see p 42.

area average has been rather slight, however, particularly

40Owing to the single currency, the trade-
weighted average of bilateral inflation differ-
entials can be used as an indicator of price
competitiveness relative to the other euro-
area trading partners. A look at the cumula-
tive rates of change of such indicators of
price competitiveness based on alternative
price or cost indices for each individual euro-
area economy since the introduction of the
euro13initially shows that the choice of index
has only a limited effect on the reported
change in price competitiveness.14
It has also become clear that, in the eight
years since the euro was introduced, relatively
small inflation differentials, owing to their
persistent nature, have accumulated into – at
times – considerable changes in the indicators
of member states’ price competitiveness, inseveral cases going into double-digit percent-
ages. The German economy is the only econ-
omy for which the indicators relative to the
other euro-area countries have uniformly
shown an increase in price competitiveness,
ranging from 5% to just under 14%. Austria,
France and Finland have also seen slight gains
in two of the three indicators. By contrast, ac-
cording to these calculations, Luxembourg,
Spain, Greece, Italy, Ireland and Portugal have
seen noticeable falls in price competitiveness.
However, these results are also partly an indir-
ect reflection of the increased competitive-
ness of the German economy, because Ger-
many is one of the key trading partners of
each of the aforementioned countries and is
therefore heavily weighted in the calculations
of those countries’ national indicators.
In the political debate, worries are repeatedly
voiced about the impact of the developments
described, especially on economies with high
inflation rates relative to the euro-area aver-
age. In order to determine the extent to
which such concerns are justified, one must
first analyse whether the reported shifts in the
indicators of price competitiveness are actually
unwelcome developments which could fun-
damentally indicate a need for economic pol-
icy action. There are two particular possible
scenarios in which this would not be the case.Average since 1975 = 100,

42Firstly, the observed inflation differentials
could have their origin in the convergence of
the prices of internationally tradable goods,
as a number of studies have shown to be the
case in Europe in the early 1990s.15The es-
tablishment of the euro area was founded
inter alia on the hope that using the single
currency could promote price convergence
among its members.16Inflation differentials
could then be understood as a resultant ad-
justment process and would thus be only a
temporary phenomenon.
Another such scenario in which inflation dif-
ferentials could not be regarded as an unwel-
come development with regard to price com-
petitiveness is if they represented “equilib-
rium” processes, which could be attributable,
for instance, to differences in productivitygrowth in the various euro-area countries.
According to the productivity approach, they
would then be reflected only in adjustments
in the prices of goods that are not inter-
nationally tradable.17
What these reflections clearly show is that

43over time by itself is insufficient to assess their
significance. Price competitiveness can there-fore be interpreted only relative to an “equi-librium level” identified along the lines ofeconomic considerations. A recent Bundes-bank study calculated various “equilibriumvalues” for price competitiveness based on al-ternative economic concepts.
18
The first concept is the relative purchasingpower parity theory. Although this theorymerely states that the real exchange rate,– and thus the price competitiveness indicatorused above – has to be stationary as a timeseries, its expected value can be approxi-mated with the long-term average of the in-dicator, which can, under this approach, beregarded as a reference value.
19A comparison of current indicator values withthe reference values calculated in this mannershows here, too, that the choice of price orcost index has only a limited influence on theresults. The price competitiveness of Finland,France and Germany is currently more favour-able than the long-term average. By contrast,the economies of Spain, Italy, Portugal, Lux-%

19The usual procedure here is to create an average from
1975 onwards. The point in time from which the average
is formed is negligible, however, at least for Germany if
the underlying time period is sufficiently long. See

44embourg and Greece are marked by competi-
tive disadvantages compared with the long-
term average. The same may be assumed for
Ireland, even though the indicator based on
unit labour costs – unlike the others – shows
the opposite to be the case.20
On the basis of the relative purchasing power
parity theory, current price competitiveness
may be regarded as unfavourable precisely in
those countries in which it has taken a visible
turn for the worse since the establishment of
monetary union. The reverse is true for Ger-
many. Consequently, the changes in price
competitiveness within the euro area over the
past few years cannot be interpreted as an
adjustment towards a reference value defined
by relative purchasing power parity theory.
This conclusion can also be reaffirmed by dis-
persion measures which show that the disper-
sion of indicators has risen noticeably since
the introduction of the euro.
However, it is also possible that a relatively
low price level in the 1970s, the beginning of
the averaging period, could be the reason
why the economies of countries such as
Greece, Portugal, Spain or Ireland, which
have been in a catching-up process in the
past few decades, are classified as being rela-
tively uncompetitive in comparison with the
long-term averages. In this case, it should be
questioned whether concepts other than the
long-term average would make better refer-
ence values, since the relative purchasing
power parity theory does not reflect such
catching-up processes.An alternative reference value can be calcu-
lated using the concept of the absolute pur-
chasing power parity theory. However, this
concept requires a comparison of price levels
between the euro-area countries that cannot
be performed with the price and cost indices
used so far. For this reason, indicators of price
competitiveness containing relative price
levels were calculated.21They indicate the ex-
tent to which the domestic price level deviates
from the weighted average of the price levels
of the euro-area trading partners which forms
the reference value according to this concept.
Since the introduction of the euro, for most
countries the indicators of price competitive-
ness calculated in this fashion have moved
similarly to the index-based indicators intro-
duced above. However – as is to be expected
– there are distinct differences in the assess-
ment of competitiveness at the current end.22
According to this concept, it is precisely the
Mediterranean countries of Greece, Portugal
20The arguments put forward in P Honohan and B Walsh
(2002), Catching up with the leaders: the Irish hare,
Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, No 1, pp 1-77,
suggest that the current values for the unit labour cost in-
dicator for Ireland are biased in Ireland’s favour. Honohan
and Walsh show that Irish labour productivity, which
forms the denominator of unit labour costs, has recently
been overstated. This is attributable to a small number of
multinational enterprises which have used the low tax
rate in Ireland and the usual transfer price rules to report
a rather large percentage of their global profits in Ireland.
21The relative price levels were calculated as the quo-
tient of purchasing power parity exchange rates taken
from the European Commission’ s “Annual macroeco-
nomic database” (AMECO) and actual nominal exchange
rates. This database is based on surveys by the national
statistical offices for a comprehensive GDP-oriented bas-
ket of goods. The nominal exchange rate between the
euro-area countries is to be set at 1 for the period since
the introduction of the euro.
22The calculations are based on annual data which are
available up to and including 2006. The latest revisions of
the data and potentially different collection methods in
the individual countries call for caution when interpreting
the results.Dispersion of

45and Spain – the price levels of which are rela-
tively low compared with their competitors –whose price competitiveness is high. Thisstands in contrast to the results obtainedusing the first approach, as does the findingthat Finland – along with Ireland and Luxem-bourg – has a lower than average level ofcompetitiveness.
The still relatively favourable current assess-
ment of the aforementioned Mediterraneancountries’ economies despite their competi-tiveness losses over the past few years indi-cates that, according to the concept of theabsolute purchasing power parity theory,price competitiveness in the euro area hasconverged as of late. This is evidenced by afalling coefficient of variation over time, ac-cording to which price levels in the euro areahave drawn more closely together.
23
This could be due to higher than average in-flation rates largely being triggered by in-creases in the prices of goods that are notinternationally tradable. According to theaforementioned productivity approach,which goes back to Balassa and Samuelson,
24
greater productivity in the manufacture oftradable goods is reflected in wage increases.In order to deter employees from seeking em-ployment in other sectors, the manufacturersof internationally non-tradable goods willthus also pay higher wages. Since, by as-sumption, productivity in this sector has notrisen as fast as in the tradable goods sector,the higher wages will cause prices for thisgroup of goods to rise, which will also in-crease the overall rate of inflation.Where euro-area inflation differentials are at-
tributable to such phenomena,
25the price
competitiveness of the economies concernedwould not be affected. Unlike in the case ofrelative or absolute purchasing power paritytheory, in this third concept, the relevant“equilibrium value” for assessing competi-tiveness is not a constant but depends insteadon relative productivity developments. Inorder to take into account potential Balassa-Samuelson effects, relative price levels wereregressed on relative productivities in a panelregression and the residuals united to forman indicator of price competitiveness adjustedfor relative productivity developments.
26
The relative productivity variables, however –despite the high level of statistical signifi-cance in the estimation – seem to have a fair-
23The question of whether prices converged following
the introduction of the euro has also been studied using
more strongly disaggregated data. Earlier studies, such as

integration after the euro, Economic Policy, Vol 19,
pp 347-384, as well as M Lutz (2004), Price convergence
under EMU? First estimates, in A V Deardorff (ed), The
Past, Present and Future of the European Union, did not
find any evidence of this. N F B Allington, P A Kattuman
and F A Waldmann (2005), One market, one money, one
price?, International Journal of Central Banking, Vol 1,
No 3, pp 73-115, by contrast, come to the opposite con-
clusion.

46ly small quantitative effect on the cumulative
change in competitiveness. Thus, this third
concept likewise diagnoses an increase in
competitiveness for Germany and Austria,
among other countries. Unlike the other con-
cepts, however, it also detects improved com-
petitiveness, for instance, for Greece, implying
that, according to this assessment, the strong
productivity growth in Greece more than off-
set the adverse effects of the relatively high
rate of Greek inflation. By contrast, Italy,
Spain, Portugal and Ireland faced more or less
pronounced losses of price competitiveness –
as also established when using the other two
concepts.
When comparing current competitiveness
with an “equilibrium value” based on this
concept, the positions of Austria, Belgium,Greece and Luxembourg tend to appear fa-
vourable, while the situation for Finland, Ire-
land and Portugal appears to be less favour-
able. All in all, this also suggests a conver-
gence of competitive positions within the
euro area.
If the results obtained with the various ap-
proaches are summarised, the following con-
clusions may be drawn – with all due caution.
Firstly, the concepts hardly differ in their as-
sessment of the development of price com-
petitiveness since the beginning of monetary
union for nearly all of the countries. For in-
stance, according to all of the indicators, Ger-
many’s price competitiveness has improved,
while Italy, Portugal, Spain and Ireland have
seen theirs deteriorate. Secondly, the inflation

47be attributed to corresponding changes in
productivities probably only to a limited ex-tent. They should thus be relevant for mem-ber states’ competitiveness.
Thirdly, the different concepts are not consist-
ent in their assessment of whether the pricecompetitiveness of the individual euro-areacountries is converging (in which case the in-flation differentials ought to be regarded asless problematic and temporary): the resultsbased on the productivity approach and theabsolute purchasing power parity theory con-firm a tendency towards adjustment, whilethe results obtained according to the relativepurchasing power parity theory point to apronounced divergence.
27This does not ne-
cessarily imply a contradiction, as real eco-nomic catching-up processes can be reflectedin different “equilibrium values” according to
the relative and the absolute purchasingpower parity theories. However, the product-ivity approach results show that the real eco-nomic convergence within the euro area isinsufficient to explain the empirical findings.
The varying results also need to be seen in the
light of the generally high level of uncertaintywith which such estimations are fraught. Oneargument against the assumption of conver-ging competitiveness in the euro area, how-ever, is that the indicators based on relativeprice levels, are possibly biased by measure-ment errors.

48by the fact that these approaches show Ger-
many’s price competitiveness to be somewhat
unfavourable for several decades despite its
export successes. Moreover, the productivity
approach fails to recognise that internationally
non-tradable goods, by functioning as inputs
in the production or distribution of tradable
goods, can affect a country’s price competi-
tiveness as well.
If euro-area members’ price competitiveness
is only partly driven by catching-up processes,
the question is then whether the persistent
inflation differentials in the euro area are also
attributable to other factors. Probably the
most prominent hypothesis in this direction
asserts that the inflation differentials are
caused by the asymmetric effects of external
shocks. It is supported by a study which finds
that the euro’s nominal effective depreciation
in the first few years of its existence contrib-
uted to inflation differentials insofar as the
countries with a large share of non-euro-area
imports were affected more harshly by im-
ported inflation.28Given differences in energy
intensity, rising oil prices could have had a
similarly asymmetric impact on member
states’ inflation rates.
Recently, however, this hypothesis has been
somewhat discredited following evidence
that the described results are attributable
only to the special case of Ireland and that,
even after taking Ireland into account, they
lose their significance once inflation persist-
ence is factored into the estimation.29More-
over, given the euro’s nominal effective ap-
preciation in the past few years, the hypoth-esis is hardly compatible with the continued
persistence of the inflation differentials.
A further conceivable cause of the inflation dif-
ferentials in the euro area is the existence of di-
vergent business cycles that could be caused,
for instance, by regional demand shocks. The
establishment of the euro area, too, could
have triggered relative demand effects since, in
some countries, it led to a perceptible fall in
capital market rates and, therefore, through fa-
vourable terms of financing, could have helped
property prices to rise, without this occurring
in other member states. Another potential rea-
son for divergences in the euro-area countries’
business cycles could lie in differences in na-
tional economic and fiscal policies.30
Although the impact of diverging cyclical de-
velopments on inflation differentials and ul-
timately on price competitiveness should be
regarded as temporary and thus less severe, it
ought to be noted that the significant infla-
tion persistence that is empirically determin-
able in Europe can perceptibly prolong these
effects. This can lead to longer-term inflation

could likewise lead to inflation differentials, is only minor.Possible reasons

49differentials, especially if the persistence is
also asymmetric.31
In addition, national wage policies could also
have played a key role. The differences in
wage developments between the individual
member states are possibly not so much a
purely cyclical phenomenon. This is already
evidenced by the fact that the price competi-
tiveness trends also recur in the indicators cal-
culated on the basis of unit labour costs:
wage developments adjusted for labour prod-
uctivity show visible discrepancies between
the euro-area countries, which accumulate
over time. This could also be suggestive of
catching-up processes, although the causes
could also be institutional, such as national
wage-setting mechanisms, indexation clauses
or country-specific labour market rigidities.
The current account and competitiveness:
an empirical study
Irrespective of the detailed reasons for the
shifts in price competitiveness, theoretical
considerations and the largely parallel devel-
opment of the current account and competi-
tive positions of individual euro-area countries
suggest a connection between the two vari-
ables. Moreover, other factors are also likely
to be reflected in current account develop-
ments.
The answer to this question is pursued in an
empirical study (see the box on pages 50-51).
It is revealed that the national current ac-
count positions of the euro-area countries are
materially affected by their price competitive-ness and the dynamics of their economic and
financial environment – in this case, using do-
mestic credit growth as an example.32
The changeover to monetary union itself,
however, also apparently seems to have
played a role of some import. For instance,
the estimation results indicate that the per-
sistence of current account positions has di-
minished since the introduction of the euro.
The improved absorption of exogenous dis-
ruptions could be a sign that monetary union
has noticeably fostered the integration of the
goods and financial markets.
The increased (relative) influence of private
credit growth on the development of net ex-
ports of goods and services also points in this
direction. One possible explanation is that ac-
cess to foreign sources of financing to satisfy
the domestic appetite for capital has been
made easier by the single currency. By con-
trast, the long-term impact of price competi-
tiveness on the balance of trade, although
still significant, has diminished perceptibly.
This is consistent with the conclusion reached
by other studies that price competitiveness
31The Eurosystem’s Inflation Persistence Network has
analysed inflation persistence in the euro area. The extent
and spread of inflation persistence in the euro area is
studied in, for instance, G Gadzinski and F Orlandi
(2004), Inflation persistence in the European Union, the
euro area, and the United States, ECB Working Paper
No 414.
32Luxembourg has a special position because of its func-
tion as a financial centre. It is not always possible to
examine the balance of payments data for Luxembourg
and Belgium separately for the period prior to 1999 be-
cause a large percentage of the externally relevant data
are available only for the two countries together. The an-
alysis thus focuses on the other ten euro-area countries
which were already members of the monetary union be-
fore 2007.Wage policy

In the following, an econometric approach is used
to examine the influence of several different vari-
ables on the ratio of national net exports of goods
and services to gross domestic product (NEXGDP).
This ratio is a good barometer of the general
trends in the individual euro-area countries’ cur-
rent account developments and may be expected
to correlate closely with competitiveness. The an-
alysis covers ten euro-area countries1over the
1980-2005 observation period and uses annual
data.2
LNPC denotes the logarithm of the indicator of
price competitiveness relative to 19 industrial coun-
tries based on consumer prices.3The index de-
scribes relative price developments between home
and abroad, converted to a single currency and
normalised to the long-term average. A deterior-
ation in price competitiveness is likely to result in a
decline in exports and a rise in imports, thus caus-
ing the net export ratio to tend to fall.
The regressions likewise clearly show how depend-
ent net exports are on the financing terms for pri-
vate investment and consumption. The growth
rate of credit to the private sector (CRDGRT) proved
to be significant in the estimations. It reflects the
dynamics of economic growth and financing terms.
Since an economic upswing is generally associated
with greater investment, an increased demand forimports and a growing appetite for capital, its im-
pact on net exports can be expected to be nega-
tive.4
In a first step, all variables were tested for the exist-
ence of a unit root. NEXGDP and CRDGRT turned
out to be stationary, whereas, according to the
tests used, the time series of the price competitive-
ness indicator is integrated of order one.5The vari-
able LNPC therefore enters into the equation in
first differences. Moreover, the estimations point
firmly to lagged effects and so the results in the
table below are based on the previous year’s values
of the explanatory variables. The equation used
can be interpreted as a reduced form.
The panel estimations were conducted using the
Arellano-Bond GMM technique.6The table
presents not only an estimation covering the entire
period but also separate results for the period be-
fore the third stage of European monetary union
(1980-1998) and the years since the introduction of
the euro (1999-2005).7
In the three estimations, all variables enter into the
equation with the expected sign and are significant
at least at the 5% level. A (more rapid) improve-
ment in price competitiveness (a decline in DLNPC)
will tend to stimulate net exports.10By contrast,
1Countries belonging to the euro area on 31 December 2006 exclud-
ing Belgium and Luxembourg which, owing to their historic econom-
ic union, have not been included in the study. — 2The indicators of
price competitiveness have been calculated by the Bundesbank; the
other data are derived from the International Financial Statistics of
the International Monetary Fund (IMF). — 3The reason for choosing
consumer prices as a base was that a comprehensive array of appro-
priate competitiveness indicators are available, thus ensuring com-
parability between the countries and between different methods of
calculation (see below). Economically speaking, however, deflators of
total sales are fundamentally preferred. — 4Private lending repre-
sents a link between the real economy and the financial sector and is
therefore related to all subcomponents of the balance of payments.
In the literature, credit growth is often used as an indicator of eco-
nomic momentum. — 5The tests used here were the panel unit roottests according to K S Im, M H Pesaran and Y Shin (2003), Testing for
unit roots in heterogeneous panels, Journal of Econometrics, Vol 115,
pp 53-74, and M Demetrescu, U Hassler and A-I Tarcolea (2006), Com-
bining significance of correlated statistics with application to panel
data, Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics, Vol 68, pp 647-663.
The existence of a unit root in the price competitiveness indicators is
a subject of dispute in the literature (see footnote 18 on page 43).
The lack of evidence for the relative purchasing power parity theory
for the sample tested here is probably linked with the heterogeneity
of the countries in the study and the associated convergence (or di-
vergence) processes. — 6M Arellano and S R Bond (1991), Some tests

51strong growth of lending to the private sector is re-
flected in a decline in net exports relative to GDP.
Particularly in the years before the beginning of
the third stage of monetary union, the individualeuro-area countries’ current account positionsshowed a rather high degree of persistence. Allother influences being neutral, a current accountdeficit, once it had developed, was reduced by onlyaround one-quarter of its value annually. The me-dium to long-term impact of credit growth andprice competitiveness was accordingly much great-er than the short-run effects shown in the table.
11
Potential deviations from the long-term equilib-rium have been eliminated much more quicklysince the introduction of the euro, as shown by thesmaller coefficient for NEXGDP
t-1. At the same
time, the (relative) significance of financing termshas grown. By contrast, the long-term impact ofprice competitiveness on the balance of trade –despite a slight increase in the short-term coeffi-cient – has dropped off.
12
The estimates were also performed using the alter-native indicators of price competitiveness intro-duced in the text. The deviations from the variablescalculated according to both absolute purchasingpower parity theory and the productivity approachwere used. The three methodologically differentmeasurement approaches were each calculated
relative to a broader group of 19 industrial coun-tries and in a direct comparison with the 11 othereuro-area countries (excluding Slovenia).
The coefficients calculated in the various estima-
tions are similar to the ones presented in the table.Adjustment for productivity differences led to onlyminute changes in the estimated parameters.
13
Moreover, the broader indicator vis-/C224-vis 19 indus-trial countries often did not have a stronger impacton net exports than the narrower indicator vis-/C224-visthe other 11 euro-area countries. Especially sincethe introduction of the euro, the price competitive-ness trend within the euro area actually seems, insome cases, to be more important for foreign tradethan changes in price competitiveness relative to19 industrial countries.

were used as additional instruments. — 7An estimation covering the
entire period with country-specific dummies for the period since theintroduction of the euro showed a significant influence of monetaryunion on the net exports of Austria, Greece, the Netherlands andSpain at the 5% level. A Wald test for the overall significance of thecountry dummies likewise confirmed the existence of a structuralbreak. The Sargan test (J-statistic) for the correct specification of theinstruments is not rejected for any of the estimations, although theJarque-Bera test rejects the null hypothesis of normally distributedresiduals. — 8t-values in parentheses. — 9With 7 overidentifying
restrictions. — 10Since LNPC was tested as I(1) and NEXGDP as I(0),
changes to LNPC in themselves do not permit any definite conclusionsregarding changes in competitiveness. The interpretation here there-fore takes into account the fact that – at least some – euro-area mem-ber countries have in the past shown trend-like changes in the levelof this indicator that did not necessarily reflect a change in their com-
petitive position. — 11The long-term coefficients result from the
steady-state assumption where NEXGDP
t=NEXGDP t-1. A one-percent-
age-point acceleration in credit growth accordingly reduced the netexports to GDP ratio by around 0.17 percentage point over the longterm. A sustained one-percentage-point decline in DLNPC, however,
caused net exports to increase by nearly 0.45% of GDP. — 12Owing
to the lower persistence, the calculated semi-elasticity value falls to0.17. However, the long-term effect of credit growth remains largelyunchanged. — 13However, the coefficients lose some of their signifi-
cance in some cases. With the exception of the coefficient for CRDGRTin the period before the introduction of the euro, however, at leastthe 10% level is maintained. — 14As described above, the long-term
coefficients of price competitiveness have fallen since the beginningof monetary union.Determinants of NEXGDP in a panel

52has become a much less influential factor for
German exports over the past few years.33
Moreover, a comparison of the indicators pre-
sented in the foregoing clearly shows that
price competitiveness vis-/C224-vis non-euro-area
countries in particular has become less im-
portant with regard to net exports. By con-
trast, the sensitivity of net exports to relative
price changes vis-/C224-vis the other euro-area
partners has dropped less sharply since the
beginning of the third stage of monetary
union. This indicates, for one thing, that
nominal exchange rate fluctuations are re-
flected to only a limited extent in the foreign
trade relationships of the group of countries
studied and are partly absorbed by the profit
margins.34For another, this observation lends
support to the assumption that the euro-area
countries also compete with one another in
third markets and that their intra-group price
competitiveness has a greater impact on their
export developments than the intra-trade
share of total trade initially suggested.
Lastly, the estimations have proven to be ro-
bust to the choice of method for measuring
price competitiveness. A rise or fall in the
productivity differences-adjusted indicator is
reflected in net exports in a manner similar to
changes in unadjusted indicators. This leads
to the conclusion that the growing current
account positions cannot be interpreted sole-
ly as a side effect of a real economic conver-
gence process in Europe.Concluding remarks
In summary, it can be noted that the current
account positions within the European mon-
etary union are only partly attributable to dif-
ferences in the economic momentum be-
tween the deficit and the surplus countries.
Price competitiveness developments also play
an important role.
Changes in the price competitiveness of indi-
vidual euro-area countries, however, are not
so easy to assess clearly in economic terms.
Although the different indicators usually
reach a relatively uniform assessment of the
underlying trends, two of the concepts used
(the absolute purchasing power parity theory
and the productivity approach) indicate that
the changes in price competitiveness be-
tween the euro-area countries since the be-
ginning of the third stage of monetary union
have been reducing previous disparities and,
to that extent, are contributing to a conver-
gence of price competitiveness positions
within the euro area. However, according to
the third indicator – based on the relative pur-
chasing power parity theory – the individual
euro-area countries’ levels of price competi-

price competitiveness to dwindle significantly. This can be
explained, among other things, by a change in German
enterprises’ price-setting behaviour.

change rate pass-through. See especially K Stahn (2006),

53tiveness have been increasingly growing
apart. At least for Germany, this indicatorhas, in the past, been largely consistent withits export developments.
Additionally, the estimations of the determin-
ants of the euro-area countries’ net exportsprovide evidence that the individual memberstates’ current account positions seem to beshifting more than could be expected withinthe framework of a real economic catching-up process. Against this background, the pos-sibility that, for instance, labour market rigid-ities could also have led to losses of pricecompetitiveness or to a worsening of individ-ual countries’ current account positions can-not be ruled out.
35
Monetary union itself could have played arole in the widening of national current ac-count positions observed over the past few
years insofar as increased economic integra-tion has made it easier to obtain access toforeign funding in order to satisfy the nation-al appetite for capital and has provided add-itional incentives for cross-border investment.This tends to increase existing surpluses ordeficits. At the same time, however, greaterinternational integration can also help to re-duce existing balances if the original motiv-ation for capital movements is no longergiven.
