Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The German economy’s underlying cyclical 
trend remained subdued at the beginning of 
2019. This was due primarily to industrial activ -
ity continuing to cool. Manufacturing could 
thus dampen overall economic growth for the 
third consecutive quarter.1 Following the de -
cline in output in the second half of 2018 due 
to the introduction of a new emissions test 
procedure, major catch- up effects in the auto -
motive sector are not expected for the current 
quarter. The downturn is likely to have con -
tinued in other industrial sectors. According to 
the ifo Institute, sentiment amongst enterprises 
in the manufacturing sector continued to de -
teriorate significantly towards the end of the 
period under review. By contrast, the construc -
tion sector and private consumption are prob -
ably buoying growth. The sharp rise in retail 
sales indicates that private consumption could 
pick up more clearly again. Consumers are 
benefiting from the continued positive labour 
market and income prospects. Furthermore, 
the fiscal measures which entered into force in 
the first quarter of 2019 are giving consumers 
additional leeway to spend.
Industry
Industrial output was in steep decline in Janu -
ary 2019. It was down by a seasonally adjusted 
1¼% on the previous month, which had been 
revised upwards, and thus fell short of the 
average of the last quarter of 2018 by a similar 
figure. This was largely attributable to a fresh 
setback in the automotive industry (-5¾%), 
which had been hard hit by the introduction of 
a new emissions test procedure (Worldwide 
harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure: 
WLTP) in the second half of 2018. Excluding the 
automotive sector, industrial output stagnated, however. The renewed dip in passenger car 
output is most likely due largely to production 
stoppages caused by a strike at an engine plant 
in Hungary. The wage dispute was resolved in 
January, however, and it is therefore expected 
that the recent losses in passenger car output 
will be temporary. This is also indicated by data 
on the numbers of manufactured passenger 
cars (available to February) provided by the 
German Association of the Automotive Indus -
try. According to these data, in seasonally ad -
justed terms, the German automotive industry 
was able to recoup recent production losses 
and almost match the December level again. 
However, output still fell well short of the aver -
age number of units produced in the first half 
of 2018. In January, the production of capital 
goods declined steeply on the quarter (-1¾%) 
overall. By contrast, the output of intermediate 
goods (-½%) and consumer goods (-¼%) saw 
a significantly smaller contraction.
Industrial new orders dropped substantially in 
January 2019 and were down by 2½% on the 
previous month in seasonally adjusted terms. 
At the same time, the December figure under -
went a similarly large upwards revision, how -
ever. This correction was mainly attributable to 
the manufacture of other transport equipment, 
which is characterised by large orders. The in -
flow of orders was also down by a substantial 
2% on the quarter. In regional terms, the in -
flow of domestic orders was unchanged, but 
there were considerably fewer orders from the 
euro area and third countries than in the final 
quarter of 2018 (-3½% in each case). Looking 
at the individual sectors, German manufactur -
ers of machinery, in particular, experienced 
weak demand (-5½%). New orders in the auto -
motive sector were also down substantially 
(-3%), after a very strong rise in the fourth German

orders and industrial output for December 2018, make it 
more difficult to assess current industrial activity.Deutsche Bundesbank

quarter of 2018. The decline in orders in this 
sector was solely related to the fall in orders 
from non- euro area countries, only few of 
which were affected by the introduction of the 
WLTP test. By contrast, orders of motor vehicles 
from Germany and the euro area were up sub -
stantially. This could be an indication that 
weaker demand from non- European countries 
may be masking the catching- up process in the 
automotive sector following WLTP- related pro -
duction stoppages. The inflow of orders in the 
capital goods sector was down significantly 
overall on the quarter (-2¼%). Intermediate 
goods producers had to cope with a similar-  
sized decline. By contrast, consumer goods 
producers recorded a distinct rise in new orders 
(+½%).
Nominal industrial turnover did not follow lack -
lustre industrial output in January 2019, instead 
rising markedly on the month after seasonal 
adjustment (+½%), with even significantly 
stronger growth of 1¾% on the quarter. With 
regard to the regional sales markets, the in -
crease is mainly derived from Germany and 
from non- euro area countries. By contrast, 
sales in the euro area declined slightly. In a 
sector  breakdown, producers of capital goods 
recorded particularly strong sales growth. Ger -
man manufacturers of machinery stood out 
here with a very significant increase, mainly in 
non- euro area countries. Furthermore, the con -
sumer goods sector also reported substantial 
growth in sales. By contrast, intermediate 
goods producers sold significantly less in terms 
of value. In January 2019, nominal goods ex -
ports remained unchanged on the month after 
seasonal adjustment. They rose significantly on 
the quarter in both nominal (+1%) and price-  
adjusted terms (+1¼%). In January, nominal im -
ports of goods rose steeply on the month and 
on the quarter (both +1½%) after seasonal ad -
justment. Excluding price effects, quarter- on- 
quarter growth was much stronger (+3%). The 
large discrepancy was related to prices for 
energy  imports, which had fallen significantly 
at the end of 2018/ beginning of 2019.Industrial

Construction industry
Construction output was up slightly in January 
2019, rising by ¼% on the month in seasonally 
adjusted terms. It moved sideways compared 
with the average of the fourth quarter of 2018. 
While activity in the main construction sector 
contracted sharply by 3¾%, output in the fin -
ishing trades rose steeply (+3½%). In spite of 
the recent decline in activity in the main con -
struction sector, capacity utilisation and the 
reach of orders in the sector are still close to 
their record highs according to surveys con -
ducted by the ifo Institute. Other economic in -
dicators also suggest that the construction 
boom in Germany is continuing. After seasonal 
adjustment there was an exceptionally strong 
and relatively broad quarter- on- quarter increase 
of 11¼% in new orders received by the main 
construction sector in the fourth quarter of 
2018 – data are available up to this date. This 
increase was largely attributable to two major 
orders in commercial civil engineering, which 
are likely to lead to an expansion in construc -
tion activity only with some time lag. However, 
the inflow of orders in housing construction, 
which is not as dependent on large orders, was 
also up significantly on the previous quarter.
Labour market
The labour market is so far withstanding the 
slowdown in economic activity. Employment 
showed steep growth at the beginning of the 
year. After seasonal adjustment, the total num -
ber of persons in work in January rose by 
79,000 on the month, which was significantly 
more than in the last months of 2018. Com -
pared to the same month of the previous year, 
the increase was 477,000 persons or 1.1%. This 
growth was based essentially on the still sub -
stantial expansion in the number of employees 
subject to social security contributions, which 
rose by as much as 2.2% in 2018. By contrast, 
the number of self- employed persons and per -
sons working exclusively in low-  paid part- time 
jobs continued to go down. All indicators of labour demand are expansionary. Labour mar -
ket tightness, as can be derived from the ratio 
of unemployed to job vacancies or the average 
vacancy period, is also still very high.
Registered unemployment was down distinctly 
in February, following only a small decline in 
January. After seasonal adjustment, 2.24 mil -
lion unemployed persons were registered with 
the Federal Employment Agency in February, 
21,000 fewer than in January. However, due to 
rounding, the unemployment rate remained at 
its low level of 5.0%. The number of un -
employed persons was down by 173,000 on 
the year. The weaker decline at the beginning 
of the year is due to an effect relating to labour 
market policy measures. Total underemploy -
ment including persons participating in labour 
market policy measures decreased evenly in the 
first two months of 2019. The unemployment 
barometer of the Institute for Employment 
Research  (IAB) continued to fall and is now in 
neutral territory, which suggests unemploy -
ment will remain largely unchanged in the next 
few months.
Prices
In February, crude oil prices continued their re -
covery from the beginning of the year and rose 
markedly, mainly due to supply cuts. They were 
just over 8% higher than in January, but still 
slightly down on the year. As this report went 
to press, a barrel of Brent crude oil cost US$67. 
The discount on crude oil futures was US$¾ 
for deliveries six months ahead and US$1½ for 
deliveries 12 months ahead.
Import prices were down slightly in January. 
This was not only attributable to a clear decline 
in energy prices. The import of other goods 
also cost slightly less. Nonetheless, industrial 
producer prices in domestic sales increased 
moderately both excluding and including en -
ergy. The year- on- year change declined to 
slightly below 1% for imports and remained at 
just above 2½% for producer prices.Construction

The revision of the sub- index for package holidays and 
its impact on the HICP and core infl  ation
In February 2019, Germany’s Federal Statis-
tical Offi   ce published the results of the regular 
revision of the German consumer price index 
(CPI). With the shift to the new base year 
2015, the weighting scheme was, as is cus-
tomary, adjusted to refl  ect changes in con-
sumption habits. In addition, the Statistical 
Offi   ce took the opportunity to undertake a 
number of methodological adjustments to the 
way in which pricing statistics are collected. In 
addition to rents, these amendments affected 
the prices of package holidays, in particular.1 
Previously, this component of consumer prices 
was based on seasonal weights, i.e. different 
weights at different times of the year, also 
taking into account different summer and 
winter destinations. However, it proved a dis-
advantage that it was impossible to interpret 
price developments particularly during the 
transition from summer to winter destinations 
and vice versa; on top of that, the separate samples meant that it was not possible to 
compare the price level of summer and winter 
destinations.2 In order to address these prob-
lems, additional year- round holiday destin-
ations were included with the revision. This 
means that it is possible to switch to a pro-
cedure where weights are fi  xed throughout 
the year.3 A comparable approach is applied 
when determining CPI components relating to 
food, which contain seasonal products.
A comparison of the seasonal fl  uctuations in 
the new series of prices for package holidays 
with the old series shows that the seasonal 
peaks are now more pronounced in the sum-
mer. By contrast, the December fi  gure, which 
generally marked the annual peak under the 
old methodology, is signifi  cantly lower than 
the summer peaks under the new method-
ology.
The altered seasonal pattern has considerable 
implications for the calculation of the Har-
monised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), 
which is, in principle, derived from the same 
dataset as the CPI. Unlike the CPI, where, for 
package holidays, the old and new series are 
chain- linked via the average of the base year, 
annual chain- linking is conducted using the 
December fi  gure for the HICP .4 Since applying 
this rule means that the revised series is now

In February, consumer prices (HICP) were up by 
0.2% in seasonally adjusted terms, after declin -
ing in the two preceding months. Food be -
came markedly more expensive. It was mainly 
clothing that drove higher prices for industrial 
goods (excluding energy). The cost of services 
did not increase any further, partly due to price 
reductions for travel and holiday services. Rents 
continued to rise moderately. Year- on- year 
headline HICP inflation was still +1.7% (CPI 
+1.5%, from +1.4%). Excluding energy and 
food, it decreased from 1.8% to 1.5%.2
Public finances
Statutory health insurance 
scheme
The statutory health insurance scheme (SHI) 
ended 2018 with a surplus of €2½ billion (€½ 
billion less than in 2017).3 The health fund’s bal -
ance increased by €1 billion, moving into posi -tive territory (to +€½ billion). However, the sur -
plus recorded by the health insurance institu -
tions fell by €1½ billion (to +€2 billion). The in -
stitutions’ financial reserves rose to €21 billion. 
Two- thirds of the institutions therefore have re -
serves above the statutory upper limit of one 
month’s average expenditure. The health fund’s 
reserve expanded to just over €9½ billion.
Health insurance institutions’ revenue, largely 
comprising transfers from the health fund, rose 
by almost 3½%. This was almost 1 percentage 
point lower than in the previous year. The slight 
drop in the average institution- specific supple -
mentary contribution rate (-0.05  percentage 
point with revenue shortfalls of just over €½ 
billion) had a dampening effect. In addition, Consumer 
prices on the

revenue  growth 
amid increasing 
expenditurebased on the seasonal high of the old HICP 
series, the annual growth rates in the fi  rst year 
after the switch to the new methodology will 
tend to be overestimated. As the HICP is not 
normally revised, this would have meant that 
the annual HICP growth rate for 2019 would 
have been signifi  cantly distorted. In order to 
circumvent this problem at the current end, 
the offi   cial statistics body decided that the 
HICP sub- series package holidays, and thus 
the HICP for Germany and for the euro area 
as a whole, should be revised back to the be-
ginning of 2015.5
However, annual growth rates in 2015 are 
now subject to the above- mentioned distor-
tions. Whereas the average annual infl  ation 
rate in Germany was previously 0.1% in 2015 
according to the HICP , it is now given as 0.7%. 
In the case of core infl  ation excluding energy 
and food, the methodological changeover 
even gives rise to an upward revision by 
0.8 percentage point. Annual HICP infl  ation 
excluding energy and food in the euro area works out at 1.1% in 2015, 0.3  percentage 
point higher than before.
In combination with the chain- linking method 
used, the switch in the seasonal pattern of 
package holiday prices as a result of the new 
data collection methodology consequently 
leads to distorted annual rates for 2015.6 Such 
changes to a key monetary policy variable 
that are attributable to purely statistical effects  
are extremely unsatisfactory and should be 
avoided where possible. In justifi  ed cases such 
as this, a more fl  exible approach to chain- 
linking would therefore be desirable.

aggregates and German package holidays methodo-

6 A similar problem occurred in 2013 in the HICP ac-
commodation services sub- index. For more informa-
tion, see Deutsche Bundesbank, The contribution of

rates, Monthly Report, April 2013, p. 7.

the €1½ billion special grant paid out by the 
health fund in the previous year was not re -
peated. By contrast, healthcare expenditure in -
creased by 4%, a slightly higher rate than in 
2017. The number of insured persons went up 
by 0.8%. The large expenditure items of hos -
pital treatment, outpatient treatment and 
pharmaceuticals rose by around 3%. Spending 
on remedies and therapeutic appliances in -
creased sharply owing to significantly higher 
fees for healthcare professionals (7½%).
All in all, the health insurance institutions re -
corded a far better result than was expected in 
autumn 2017. Expenditure was much lower 
than their estimates suggested. In addition, the 
supplementary contribution rates did not, on 
average, fall to the rate deemed necessary by 
the Federal Ministry of Health at that time to 
cover relevant expenditure.
The health fund also exceeded expectations 
with a small surplus thanks, above all, to em -ployment developments, and thus contribution 
receipts, being more favourable. Despite the 
slightly lower supplementary contribution rates, 
contribution receipts increased by 4%. Employ -
ees’ contributions rose by 4½% due to positive 
wage and labour market developments. Pen -
sion contributions increased to a lesser extent 
(+3%). The central government grant remained 
stable compared with 2017. Spending (mainly 
transfers to the health insurance institutions) 
increased by 3½%.
In autumn 2018, the official SHI estimators ex -
pected the health fund to break even this year. 
On the revenue side, income subject to com -
pulsory insurance contributions is set to con -
tinue rising significantly. Growth in employees’ 
contributions (just over 3½%) will be curbed by 
the lowering of contributions to be paid by 
self- employed persons with low incomes (-€1 
billion). In view of the considerable expansion 
of pension benefits, a far sharper increase of 
5½% is assumed for pension contributions. The However, result

temporary deterioration in the macroeconomic 
outlook is likely to initially have, at most, a 
moderately adverse impact on contribution 
receipts , as these are largely dependent on the 
relatively robust labour market. On balance, 
payments made by the health fund to the in -
novation and structural funds,4 which were not 
included in the official SHI estimators’ calcula -
tions, could cause the health fund to run up a 
deficit.
The official SHI estimators foresee an acceler -
ated rise in spending of just under 4½% for the 
health insurance institutions. For example, hos -
pitals have been reimbursed in full for the costs 
for additional nursing staff since the start of 
the year. This represents a departure from the 
usual system of lump- sum payments based on 
diagnosis-related groups, which are intended 
to support economic efficiency. Furthermore, 
the health insurance institutions will transfer 
just over €½ billion per year to the long- term 
care insurance institutions’ equalisation fund to 
finance additional places for elderly care. The 
health insurance scheme is thus funding tasks 
performed by the long- term care insurance 
scheme. Factoring in these additional outlays, 
the Federal Ministry of Health calculated a re -
duction of 0.1% percentage point (to 0.9%) for 
the arithmetical supplementary contribution 
rate required, on average, to cover relevant ex -
penditure. However, the actual average rate 
only fell to 1.0% at the start of the year. As a 
result, even in the face of new burdens arising 
from the Appointment Service and Care Act 
(Terminservice- und Versorgungsgesetz),  there 
may once again be surpluses.
There is currently debate as to whether to 
lower the contributions levied on occupational 
pensions and other pensions. This would put a 
heavy financial burden on the health insurance 
scheme. If these contributions were halved (as 
was the case prior to 2004),5 revenue of around 
€3 billion per year would be wiped out.6 This 
corresponds to revenue shortfalls amounting to 
around 0.2 percentage point of the contribu -
tion rate.Calls for lowering contributions are founded on 
the argument that contributions are currently 
levied twice over, i.e. they are levied in both the 
saving phase and the pension phase. However, Health insurance

4 The health fund makes scheduled payments totalling €½ 
billion per year from the liquidity reserve to the innovation 
and structural funds. The innovation fund provides annual 
funding of €300 million for healthcare innovations. Fund -
ing is divided equally between the health fund and the 
health insurance institutions. The structural fund promotes 
investment at the state government level to improve 
healthcare provision structures in the hospital sector.
5 Since the Act Modernising the Statutory Health Insurance 
Scheme (GKV- Modernisierungsgesetz)  came into force in 
2004, the full SHI contribution has been levied.

this occurs in only a few exceptional cases.7 As 
a general rule, transfers to institutions for occu -
pational retirement provision (IORPs) and pen -
sion provision top- ups are not subject to SHI 
contributions.8 In this respect, it appears logical 
to subject occupational pensions and other 
pensions, such as deferred compensation, to 
contributions and to not lower contributions.
The currently strong financial situation, charac -
terised by surpluses and high reserves, is mask -
ing foreseeable demographic pressure. It may 
appear possible to fund benefit increases or 
concessions in the short run. However, they 
would make the need for unpopular benefit cuts or raised contribution rates – which will 
weigh on macroeconomic development – even 
greater in future. It is important to not lose 
sight of this in the current debate.
Public long- term care 
insurance  scheme
The public long- term care insurance scheme 
deficit increased by €1 billion to €3½ billion in 
2018.9 Revenue rose by 4%, with employees’ 
contributions increasing by just over 4½% and 
pension contributions going up by 3½%. At 
6%, expenditure growth was much stronger 
than growth in revenue. The benefit rates were 
not adjusted last year. However, the second Act 
to Strengthen Long- term Care (Pflegestär -
kungsgesetz II),  which put an enormous strain 
on the scheme’s coffers in 2017, continued to 
drive up spending significantly. That said, this 
effect largely tailed off over the course of the 
year. The general reserves reached their peak at 
the end of 2016, hitting €9½ billion. By the 
end of 2018, they had shrunk to just under 
€3½ billion.
At the start of 2019, the contribution rate was 
raised from 2.55% to 3.05% (plus an extra 
0.25% in each case for childless persons). This 
will generate additional annual revenue of €7½ 
billion. Expenditure will increase on account of 
payments for additional nursing staff. However, 
the bulk of this will be covered by the health

insurance institutions in the form of transfers to 
the long- term care insurance institutions’ 
equalisation fund. Overall, a significant surplus 
is expected for 2019. In view of the major con -
tribution rate hike, surpluses are envisaged in 
the medium term, too. However, the greater 
the number of benefit expansions that are 
adopted, the faster the pressure stemming 
from demographic change to raise contribution 
rates will mount.
Securities markets
Bond market
At €129.8 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in January 2019 was again signifi -
cantly up on the previous month’s figure (€58.1 
billion). After taking account of increased re -
demptions and changes in issuers’ holdings of 
their own debt securities, the outstanding vol -
ume of domestic bonds rose by €20.3 billion, 
following a drop of €31.4 billion in December. 
The outstanding volume of foreign debt secur -
ities in the German market grew by €13.9 bil -
lion, which meant that the outstanding volume 
of domestic and foreign debt securities in Ger -
many in January increased by €34.2 billion on 
balance.
The public sector issued bonds worth €10.6 bil -
lion net in the reporting month. Central gov -
ernment increased its capital market debt by 
€3.9 billion on balance. It issued mainly two-  
year Federal Treasury notes (Schätze) and Treas -
ury discount paper (Bubills) (€6.9 billion and 
€5.3 billion respectively), but also five- year Fed -
eral notes (Bobls) on a smaller scale (€3.8 bil -
lion). This contrasted with net redemptions of 
ten- year Federal bonds (Bunds) totalling €13.2 
billion. State and local governments issued 
bonds with a net value of €6.7 billion.
Domestic credit institutions raised their capital 
market debt by €8.4 billion net in January, fol -
lowing net redemptions of €9.3 billion in the 
previous month. This was mainly attributable to debt securities issued by specialised credit insti -
tutions (€6.6 billion) and mortgage Pfandbriefe 
(€4.7 billion). By contrast, there were redemp -
tions of other bank debt securities that can be 
structured flexibly coming to €4.4 billion net.
German enterprises, too, expanded their cap -
ital market debt in January (€1.3 billion). On 
balance, this was attributable to other financial 
intermediaries and insurance corporations, 
whereas non- financial corporations redeemed 
bonds in net terms.
Foreign investors were the main purchasers in 
January, adding domestic debt securities with a 
net value of €24.9 billion to their portfolios. 
Domestic non- banks also purchased bonds for 
€9.5 billion net; ultimately, these were exclu -
sively foreign securities. German credit institu -
tions topped up their bond portfolios to the 
tune of €1.5 billion net; here, too, interest was 
focused on foreign securities. Following the

system’s asset purchase programmes at the 
end of 2018, the Bundesbank’s securities port -
folio was reduced by €1.7 billion net in January 
for operational reasons.
Equity market
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
raised fresh funds of €0.7 billion on balance 
from placing new shares in the German equity 
market. Net issuance of foreign equities in Ger -
many totalled €3.7 billion in the same period. 
Domestic non- banks were the main buyers, ac -
quiring equities worth €6.1 billion on balance. 
By contrast, non- resident investors and domes -
tic credit institutions sold equities for €1.6 bil -
lion and €0.1 billion net respectively.
Mutual funds
Domestic mutual funds recorded inflows of 
€7.7 billion in January. Specialised funds re -
served for institutional investors were the main 
beneficiaries (€6.2 billion). Of the various asset 
classes, funds were chiefly invested in mixed 
securities- based funds (€5.1 billion) and open-  
end real estate funds (€2.4 billion). Foreign mu -
tual funds placed shares worth €3.7 billion in 
the German market in January. On balance, do -
mestic non- banks were the sole purchasers of 
mutual fund shares in the reporting month 
(€13.8 billion). By contrast, there were net sales 
of fund shares by domestic credit institutions 
and non- resident investors in the amount of 
€1.3 billion and €1.1 billion respectively.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur -
plus of €18.3 billion in January 2019. The result 
was down by €4.8 billion from the previous 
month’s level. Although the surplus in the 
goods account expanded, the surplus in invis -
ible current transactions – comprising the ser -vices account as well as primary and secondary 
income – narrowed substantially more strongly.
In the reporting month, the surplus in the 
goods account expanded by €1.7 billion on the 
month to €15.1 billion. Exports of goods rose 
more sharply than imports of goods, with the 
increase of net exports under merchanting 
playing a key role.
In January, the surplus in invisible current trans -
actions fell by €6.5 billion to €3.3 billion. In the 
secondary income account, the deficit slimmed; 
however, the primary income account and the 
services account saw their surpluses decline 
sizeably. Net receipts in primary income 
dropped by €5.2 billion to €9.2 billion. This was 
due, in particular, to the normalisation of other 
income following payment in December of the 
bulk of agricultural subsidies under the EU 
budget – as is standard practice at year- end. 
Services showed a net deficit of €0.9 billion 
after recording a surplus of €1.8 billion in De -
cember. The reason for the turnaround was the 
fact that income diminished by a greater extent 
than expenditure, with IT services and other 
business-  related services of particular import -
ance on both sides of the balance sheet. By 
contrast, in the secondary income account, the 
deficit narrowed by €1.4 billion to €5.0 billion. 
There were two key contributing factors: the 
decline in government expenditure, especially 
on current transfers relating to international 
cooperation and for payments to the EU 
budget in the context of financing related to 
gross national income, exceeded the decline in 
income; in addition, non-  government sectors 
reduced their expenditure.
In January 2019, transactions on the inter -
national financial markets were characterised 
by a wait- and- see stance with regard to the 
future  orientation of monetary policy on both 
sides of the Atlantic, as well as by mounting 
evidence of the global economy cooling. Ger -
many’s cross- border securities transactions

billion). Foreign investors acquired German se -
curities worth €22.2 billion net. Their demand 
was focused mainly on private and public sec -
tor bonds (€15.1 billion together) and money 
market instruments (€9.8 billion). However, for -
eign investors parted with equities (€1.6 billion) 
and mutual fund shares (€1.1 billion). Domestic 
investors purchased foreign securities worth 
€21.2 billion. They acquired – particularly euro- 
denominated  – bonds (€9.0 billion), money 
market instruments (€4.9 billion), mutual fund 
shares (€3.7 billion) and equities (€3.6 billion).
Foreign direct investment on balance recorded 
net capital exports of €15.6 billion in January 
(December: net capital imports of €1.6 billion). 
Domestic enterprises increased their investment 
abroad by €18.8 billion. They expanded their 
equity capital by €12.2 billion, with reinvested 
earnings playing a key role. Intra- group credit 
transactions, too, saw funds in the amount of 
€6.6 billion flow out of Germany – mainly in the 
form of financial credit. Foreign firms injected 
capital into affiliated enterprises in Germany as 
well (€3.1 billion), increasing equity capital by 
€1.7 billion and granting additional loans 
amounting to €1.4 billion on balance.
Other statistically recorded investment, which 
comprises loans and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank de -
posits and other investment, saw outflows of 
capital in the amount of €2.3 billion in January 
(December: €5.5 billion). The banking system 
recorded net capital exports of € 4,6 billion. In 
this connection, the Bundesbank’s net claims 
rose by €34.1 billion – mainly due to a reduc -
tion in deposits by non- euro area residents. 
This outweighed the decline in TARGET2 claims, 
which contracted by €98 billion in January. 
Minor outflows from government funds were 
also recorded (€4.7 billion). By contrast, enter -
prises and households were net importers of 
capital (€6.9 billion).
The Bundesbank’s reserve assets experienced

values) in January.Direct

German balance of payments in 2018
In 2018, the German economy’s current account surplus decreased by ¾ percentage point to 
7¼% of nominal gross domestic product (GDP). This was due to a sharp decline in the goods 
trade surplus, whereas developments in the other sub- accounts tended to push up the surplus. 
For instance, the slowdown in global trade growth hampered Germany’s export performance, 
while goods imports rose sharply on the back of favourable domestic economic conditions. Fur -
thermore, the steep rise in the price of internationally traded commodities diminished the goods 
trade surplus, as in the previous year. In terms of domestic saving and investment decisions, an 
increase in private investment against the backdrop of the fairly high aggregate capacity utilisa -
tion in 2018 was one of the main factors dampening Germany’s current account surplus. Mean -
while, national saving as a percentage of GDP continued to increase during the reporting year.
As in previous years, some of these savings flowed abroad as net capital exports. At €225½ bil -
lion, however, this figure was significantly lower than in 2017. The gradual reduction of the 
monthly purchase volumes under the Eurosystem’s expanded asset purchase programme (APP) 
also led to changes in portfolio investment. For example, foreign investors sold fewer German 
debt securities than in the years before; portfolio shifts by German investors in favour of foreign 
securities were also less pronounced. The Bundesbank’s TARGET2 claims, which have been 
strongly influenced by the APP since 2015, increased only moderately in 2018. Commercial banks’ 
external liabilities declined over the past year, having risen in 2016 and 2017 – in some instances 
as a counterpart to the Bundesbank’s rising TARGET2 claims. In contrast to the global decline in 
direct investment flows, German enterprises continued to significantly expand their direct invest -
ment operations last year. On the other hand, Germany was also a sought- after destination for 
foreign direct investment (FDI). Euro area countries were the main partners for FDI in both direc -
tions.Deutsche Bundesbank

Current account
Underlying trends in the 
current  account
Germany’s current account surplus went down 
by €15½ billion to €246½ billion in 2018. In 
relation to nominal GDP , it fell by ¾ percentage 
point to 7¼%. As a result, after declining for 
three years, this put it significantly lower than 
its peak of 8½% of GDP in 2015.1 As things 
stand, the current account balance will prob -
ably continue to decline until 2020.2 Even so, it 
is likely that the threshold of 6% of GDP set by 
the European Commission as part of the pro -cedure for preventing and correcting macro -
economic imbalances will continue to be sur -
passed.3
The decline in the current account balance 
masks divergent developments in its sub- items. 
On the one hand, the surplus in the goods 
account  decreased. This was due to both price 
and volume effects. On the other hand, devel -
opments in the other sub- accounts tended to 
boost the surplus. For instance, the services 
account  recorded a slightly smaller deficit. 
Moreover, the primary income surplus rose be -
cause the year-  on- year increase in Germany’s 
net external assets and the improved yield dif -
ferential more than offset the dampening ef -
fect of the further drop in the yield level of for -
eign assets held by domestic investors. Finally, 
the deficit in the secondary income balance 
receded from the high level it had reached in 
the previous year as a result of one- off effects.
Given the slow recovery of the global economy, 
German enterprises faced less favourable global 
economic conditions in 2018. In particular, 
global industrial output and the pace of world 
trade slowed markedly. On top of this, German 
exporters were confronted with an unfavour -
able regional export demand situation, mean -
ing that, viewed together, growth in their sales 
markets in the advanced economies and the 
emerging economies even lagged behind 
growth in global trade during the reporting

The drivers of German net exports from the perspective 
of a DSGE model
Microfounded dynamic stochastic general 
equilibrium (DSGE) models have become 
one of the established standard instruments 
of macroeconomic analysis.1 Within this 
model framework, macroeconomic devel-
opments are the outcome of the individual 
behaviour of economic agents. These 
agents are assumed to make optimal deci-
sions and to not make systematic errors 
when forming expectations.
In a DSGE model developed by the Bundes-
bank which covers a number of economic 
regions, it is possible to analyse Germany’s 
international trade with other euro area 
countries and with countries from the rest 
of the world, which are assumed to have an 
independent monetary policy.2 With regard 
to the analysis of net exports (i.e. the bal-
ance of trade in goods and services), two 
core elements of this type of model are of 
importance. The fi  rst is households’ utility 
maximising decisions between current and 
future consumption, taking into account 
expected income and interest rates. Ac-
cording to this, households expecting their 
income situation to worsen in the future 
would, for example, already limit their cur-
rent consumption, and this would tend to 
increase net exports. The second is that en-
terprises’ investment decisions, which are 
also the outcome of an optimisation prob-
lem in the model, play a role in the develop-
ment of net exports. This is because, from a 
macroeconomic perspective, net export 
surpluses can, for instance, refl  ect the reluc-
tance of households and enterprises to con-
sume or invest.
In the model, optimal consumption or in-
vestment decisions are adjusted if unex-
pected developments (shocks) occur. For example, unexpected and persistently lower 
productivity growth could lead to a reduc-
tion in current private consumption, which 
tends to increase net exports. Using the es-
timated DSGE model, past cyclical fl  uctu-
ations of German net exports can be attrib-
uted to the contributions of the underlying 
economic shocks.3
One thing the model does is cover shocks 
that originate in the German economy. 
These shocks relate to the fi  elds of technol-
ogy, savings, investment, public spending 
and wages. However, it also identifi  es the 
contributions of monetary policy shocks in 
the euro area, as well as those from com-
bined shocks in the rest of the euro area 
and the rest of the world. This breakdown 
makes it possible to gauge the importance

nomic Perspectives, Vol. 32, pp. 113-140; and Deutsche

models for the German economy, Monthly Report, July 
2008, pp. 31-46.

many the answer?, in preparation for publication as a

study of the German current account balance, see

3 These contributions include the initial impact of the 
shocks as well as potential follow- on effects in subse-
quent periods. The shock decomposition of net ex-
ports, which were the main reason for the increase in 
the current account surplus in the period since 2000, 
was carried out relative to gross domestic product 
(GDP). The other components of the current account 
balance are primary and secondary income. In add-
ition, the ratio of net exports was mean- adjusted prior 
to the model estimation. The results therefore relate to 
fl  uctuations around the mean ratio of German net ex-
ports in the estimation period, which stretches from 
the second quarter of 1995 to the third quarter of 
2018 and thus does not yet include changes as part of 
the 2018 annual revision.Deutsche Bundesbank

of domestic and foreign factors in the de-
velopment of German net exports.4
Between 1995 and 2015, German net ex-
ports increased from ½% to 7½% of GDP , 
with the bulk of this increase being concen-
trated in two periods of time. The fi  rst was 
from the beginning of the 2000s until the 
onset of the fi  nancial crisis of 2007/ 2008; 
the second covers the period since the start 
of the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area 
in 2011 until 2015.
According to the model results, the increase 
in the ratio of net exports in the 2000 to 
2007 period was, as far as domestic deter-
minants are concerned, for the most part 
attributable to additional savings, declining 
government spending, as well as the in-
creasingly positive contributions of techno-
logical improvements. Among the external 
factors, developments in the rest of the 
euro area, which stimulated German net exports, were a major factor in the latter’s 
increase. In this context, a decrease in sav-
ings and additional government spending 
were among the important factors.
The further increase in the ratio of net ex-
ports in the period from 2011 to 2015 was 
related to a substantial additional build- up 
of economy- wide domestic savings and 
improvements in the use of production 
technologies. In addition, according to the 
model results, muted domestic investment 
and, to some extent, subdued government 
spending also contributed to this develop-

infl  uenced by the distance of the variables from the 
corresponding equilibrium values at the beginning of 
the observation period. In the historical shock decom-
position, this is taken into account by the contribution 
of the initial condition.Model-based shock decomposition of German net exports

ment.5 Other developments in Germany 
(Other DE), including changes in the price 
mark- up of tradable goods as well as to 
the share of tradable goods in overall con-
sumption, also contributed to the increase 
in the surplus. The extraordinarily accom-
modative euro area monetary policy in 
recent  years appears to have led to a slight 
increase in the surplus, probably also as a 
result of the induced depreciation of the 
euro exchange rate. Developments in the 
rest of the world also increased the surplus 
on balance. As in Germany, changes to the 
share of tradable goods in overall con-
sumption as well as risk premium shocks 
were of importance here. By contrast, 
since the sovereign debt crisis, develop-
ments in the rest of the euro area have in-
creasingly dampened German net exports. 
These include comparatively weak invest-
ment activity, higher savings and lower 
government spending. In addition, particu-
larly subdued wage growth in Germany 
– even before 2011 – seems to have played 
almost no role in the increase in net ex-
ports.
Overall, the results presented support the 
hypothesis that the large and persistent sur-
plus of German net exports is attributable 
to several factors. The accumulation of sav-
ings in Germany is one of the factors that 
has contributed to an increasing surplus 
over a prolonged period of time. This fi  nd-
ing is consistent with the increase in 
economy- wide savings, which is attribut-
able to a signifi  cant extent to non- fi  nancial 
corporations.6 Although weak domestic in-
vestment and low government spending 
also tended to increase the surplus, their 
quantitative effects were smaller. Moreover, 
according to the analyses, a considerable 
part of the dynamics of German net exports 
is attributable to external factors. However, 
this development refl  ects, at times, partly 
offsetting contributions stemming from the rest of the euro area and the rest of the 
world over large stretches of the post-2000 
period.
5 The results do not allow a distinction to be made 
between public and private investment. Furthermore, 
in light of the strong population growth, the fi  nding 
that the dynamics of domestic investment have been 
comparatively strong since the fi  rst half of 2017 may 
have also been masked in the shock decomposition 
due to the per capita perspective chosen. See, for ex-
ample, Deutsche Bundesbank, The German economy, 
Monthly Report, November 2018, pp. 44-53.

by an average of just over 5% on the year. The 
euro mainly appreciated against the US dollar 
and the Swiss franc, but also against the ren -
minbi and the yen. Germany’s price competi -
tiveness deteriorated somewhat as a result. 
Price factors also tended to dampen economic 
activity in Germany. For instance, the price of 
crude oil, in particular, rose very sharply. A bar -
rel of Brent crude oil cost an average of US$71 
in 2018 – just under one- third more than in the 
previous year.
Besides the less favourable global economic 
environment, in the second half of the year, 
problems in the automotive industry stemming 
from the introduction of a new EU- wide emis -
sions testing procedure for new motor vehicle 
registrations weakened Germany’s export per -
formance.4 Although nominal goods exports 
expanded significantly overall, growth was 
below average compared to the previous years. 
Imports benefited from domestic economic 
conditions, which remained positive, although the growth in the volume of imports lagged 
slightly behind the figures recorded in the pre -
vious years, in line with the slackening pace of 
domestic growth. The increase in the price of 
goods imports, which was relatively strong 
compared to that of exports, meant that im -
port growth outpaced export growth to an 
even greater degree in nominal terms than in 
real terms. As a result, the foreign trade bal -
ance decreased significantly in the reporting 
year. In purely mathematical terms, volume 
effects  accounted for roughly two- fifths of the 
decline, and price effects for three- fifths.
In regional terms, the current account balance 
vis- à- vis other euro area countries fell by ¼ per -
centage point to 2½% of GDP . The decline was 
mainly due to a smaller surplus in the goods 
account, which overshadowed the reduced 
deficit in services trade. The current account 
balance vis- à- vis non- euro area countries 
dropped by ½  percentage point to 4¾% of 
GDP . This was mainly the result of a smaller sur -
plus in the goods account, whose decline in 
comparison with the previous year significantly 
exceeded the improvement in the primary in -
come balance.
Looking at the components of aggregate net 
lending/ net borrowing, the fall in Germany’s 
current account surplus relative to GDP was 
due to an increase in private investment in the 
context of fairly high aggregate capacity utilisa -
tion in 2018. This was mainly because business 
investment remained brisk and private residen -
tial investment increased again. By contrast, 
national saving as a percentage of GDP con -
tinued to grow in 2018, driven, in particular, by 
high levels of public sector saving. Looking at 
the balances of the individual sectors, the de -
crease in net lending by non-  financial corpor -
ations played a major role in the decline in 
the current account balance. Saving by non-

between the early 2000s and 2015, dipped 
slightly again in 2018 (see also the box on 
pp.  24 ff.). General government net lending 
increased  considerably last year owing to sharp 
rises in social contributions and, above all, tax. 
Although significant in absolute terms, net 
lending by households remained broadly un -
changed.
Goods flows and balance of 
trade
German foreign trade activity was considerably 
more subdued in 2018 than in the year before. 
The slowdown in global trade, which had been 
extremely lively the previous year, had a par -
ticularly dampening influence on export activ -
ity. This was compounded by an unfavourable 
structure in terms of regions and product 
ranges, as well as the further appreciation of 
the euro. In price- adjusted terms, goods ex -
ports in 2018 virtually failed to surpass their 
level at the end of 2017. On an annual average, 
they nonetheless recorded an increase of 1¾% 
because exports had expanded considerably in 
the course of 2017. With regard to imports, for -
eign producers benefited from the ongoing 
buoyant domestic demand in Germany in the 
reporting year. Demand for machinery and 
equipment, which has a high import content, 
gained further momentum, which was particu -
larly beneficial to manufacturers abroad. This 
partly offset the dampening effect on the de -
mand for foreign goods that stemmed from 
the loss of momentum in German exports, 
which also have a relatively high import con -
tent. At 3% in price- adjusted terms, imports of 
goods rose distinctly more sharply than ex -
ports. Imports increased even more strongly in 
nominal terms, at 5¾%. The difference be -
tween the value of imports and exports, the 
latter of which went up by 3%, narrowed 
mainly as a result of the increase in the prices 
of energy products. On balance, the foreign 
trade surplus fell significantly by €20 billion to 
€228 billion in 2018.Foreign trade

On the corporate payout ratio in Germany
Increased savings of non- fi  nancial corpor-
ations played a major role in driving Ger-
many’s current account surplus to today’s 
high level.1 One key factor in this develop-
ment in purely arithmetical terms, besides 
the increase in corporate profi  tability, has 
been the lower share of profi  ts distributed 
to corporations’ shareholders.2 The aggre-
gate payout ratio of non- fi  nancial corpor-
ations –  measured as distributed income 
paid relative to net profi  ts – has been on 
the decline since the beginning of the mil-
lennium.3 Coming to roughly 95% in 2001, 
this ratio has since dwindled by around 
20 percentage points to 75% on average 
for the 2014-18 period, according to data 
reported in Germany’s national accounts.
At the beginning of the last decade, the 
payout ratio in Germany was far higher 
than in the other countries of the euro area 
or European Union. However, neither these 
economic areas nor Japan, the United King-
dom or the United States have seen the 
average payout ratio decline signifi  cantly on 
balance. This would suggest that, to some 
extent, the strong contribution which the 
declining payout ratio of German enter-
prises has made to the rise in corporate sav-
ings over recent years also refl  ects a nor-
malisation of sorts by international stand-
ards.4
Disaggregated data on the distributions of 
earnings by German enterprises based on 
the Bundesbank’s corporate balance sheet 
statistics suggest that the decline in the 
payout ratio, rather than being confi  ned to 
any particular size class, legal form or eco-
nomic sector, has been a widespread devel-
opment across Germany’s corporate sector. 
While the decline has shown only minor dif-
ferences in magnitude across fi  rm charac-
teristics, large enterprises and stock corpor-ations generally had lower payout ratios 
than the other fi  rm types. A comparison of 
the manufacturing and services sectors, on 
the other hand, showed no noteworthy dif-
ferences in terms of the level of the payout 
ratio or the magnitude of its decline.
Besides descriptive analyses, it is also pos-
sible to use econometric estimates to iden-
tify which factors have been driving the de-
cline in the payout ratio. These estimates 
subject common theories on the decline in 
the corporate payout ratio in Germany 
–  includ ing those suggested in the aca-
demic literature – to an initial assessment 
using suitable datasets and methods in 
each case.
Enterprises looking to deleverage
One possible theory for the decline in the 
payout ratio is deleveraging by German en-
terprises. These had relatively high leverage 
ratios by international standards at the end 
of the 1990s and have since made lasting

current account surplus, Annual Report 2013, pp. 39-
60.
2 See Deutsche Bundesbank, The savings of non- 
fi  nancial corporations in Germany, Monthly Report, 
March 2018, pp. 20-22.
3 Net profi  ts based on national accounts data were 
calculated in line with the net income/ net loss for the 
fi  nancial year fi  gures reported in corporations’ income 
statements – that is to say, as net savings plus distrib-
uted income paid. The results look much the same if 
the payout ratio is modifi  ed such that net distributed 
income (i.e. distributed income paid less distributed in-
come received) is used in the numerator or corporate 
profi  ts (i.e. profi  ts before taxes and net transfers) are 
used in the denominator.
4 In many advanced economies, non- fi  nancial enter-
prises’ savings relative to their gross value added have 
risen strongly since the 1990s. See P . Chen, L. Karabar-
bounis and B. Neiman (2017), The global rise of cor-
porate saving, Journal of Monetary Economics 89(C), 
pp. 1-19.Deutsche Bundesbank

improvements to their equity capital base.5 
To test this theory, relatively highly lever-
aged enterprises are compared with enter-
prises whose leverage ratios are on the low 
side in order to explore how their respective 
payout ratios have evolved since 2001 rela-
tive to the pre-2001 period; this assessment 
is based on individual data from German 
corporate balance sheets.6 If this approach 
fi  nds that the payout ratio diverges more 
strongly as of 2001, it could be put down to 
the role played by corporate leverage. The 
econometric results support this theory, 
since the payout ratio of fi  rms with rela-
tively low equity ratios, and high levels of 
bank debt and long- term liabilities showed 
a particularly steep and statistically signifi  -
cant decline.
Cut in corporate tax rates in 2000-01
The corporate tax reform in 2000 and 2001 
lowered corporate income tax to a uniform 
rate of 25%, down from pre- reform rates of 
40% on retained earnings and 30% on dis-
tributed profi  ts. Following the reform, it 
tended to be more attractive, in taxation 
terms, to retain profi  ts as a means of fund-
ing new investment than to pay out profi  ts 
and raise fresh equity capital. Furthermore, 
tax cuts tend, in theory, to diminish the tax 
benefi  ts of debt fi  nancing.7 Thus, fi  rms 
which had a high effective marginal tax rate 
prior to this reform might have reduced 
their payout ratio after the reform by more 
than other fi  rms.8 According to the results 
of the same empirical approach as before, 
but with fi  rms now being distinguished by 
their effective tax rate, the effects of the tax 
reform do indeed point in the expected 
direc tion. This approach fi  nds no evidence 
of a statistically signifi  cant infl  uence, how-
ever.95 See Deutsche Bundesbank, Capital base of non- 
fi  nancial enterprises in Germany sustainably strength-

6 Balanced samples of fi  rms were taken for the 1998-
2005 period based on a difference- in- differences ap-
proach. The fi  rm- specifi  c payout ratio was regressed 
on a dummy variable for the period as of 2001 as well 
as on an interaction term composed of this dummy 
variable and the mean of the data for selected fi  rm 
characteristics in the pre- 2001 period. The estimated 
equation also includes fi  xed effects at the fi  rm level.

9 One factor that might have a bearing here is that the 
fi  rm- specifi  c effective marginal tax rate used in the cal-
culations is only roughly approximated using the rela-
tion of taxes paid to profi  ts. There is also the diffi   culty 
of conceptually distinguishing between the effects of 
the corporate tax reform and those of deleveraging, if 
highly leveraged fi  rms also tend to have higher mar-
ginal tax rates. See D. Givoly, C. Hayn, A. R. Ofer and

Financing intangible assets
Intangible assets have become increasingly 
important on corporate balance sheets over 
the past few decades, to the detriment of 
tangible assets. Given that intangible assets 
tend to be pledged far less often than trad-
itional capital goods as collateral for loans, 
the relatively high level of capital needed 
to  fi  nance them could also be refl  ected  
in increased corporate savings.10 However, 
based on the empirical approach – but this 
time with fi  rms being grouped by their 
share of intangible assets to total assets – 
there is no indication that the increasing 
share of intangible assets has been instru-
mental in the drop in the corporate payout 
ratio.
Dividend smoothing
According to the empirical academic litera-
ture, fi  rms believe that it is very important to keep their payouts stable.11 This would 
suggest that when a fi  rm records rising 
profi  ts, it will be hesitant to increase its pay-
out level, with the result that its payout 
ratio will drop temporarily. The smoothing 
theory can be tested using another empir-
ical model according to which changes in a 
fi  rm’s dividend payouts can be traced back 
partially to its profi  t level and partially to the 
dividends paid out in the prior period.12 
Accord ing to this model, the role which 
smoothing considerations play in dividend 
payouts is evident from a comparison of the 
dividend payouts computed by the model 
with those in a hypothetical scenario in 
which only current profi  ts are a factor. Since 
the model fi  nds that the payout ratios are 
similar in both cases, it appears that the in-
tended smoothing of dividend payouts has 
not contributed a great deal to the decline 
in the corporate payout ratio in Germany.13
Substitution with share buybacks
For listed companies, share buybacks are 
another  way of distributing profi  ts to their 
shareholders.14 For the United States, there 
is evidence to suggest that corporate share 
buybacks have been used to substitute divi-

13 The calculations do point to the existence of 
smoothing considerations, but their contribution to 
the evolution of the payout ratio is extremely small, 
given its minimal importance for the average fi  rm and 
profi  t growth at the fi  rm level.

In regional terms, year- on- year growth in the 
value of exports to the most important target 
countries and sales regions was generally less 
buoyant on average in 2018 than in 2017. This 
was also the case in price- adjusted terms, ac -
cording to which exports to the euro area in -
creased by 3% and to countries outside of the 
euro area by 1¼%. Viewed over the course of 
the year, the relatively weak performance of 
price adjusted regional exports in 2018 be -
comes clearer. Although exports to euro area 
countries in 2018 rose by 1¾% until the final 
quarter in nominal terms compared to the last 
quarter of 2017, in price- adjusted terms, they 
exceeded this level by just ¼%. Exports to non- 
euro area countries grew by a nominal 1¼% 
over the same period; however, at last count, 
they were nonetheless ½% lower than in the 
fourth quarter of 2017 after adjustment for de -
velopments in sales prices.
Turning to nominal exports to EU countries, the 
annual average figures showed a particular de -cline in exports to the United Kingdom. Prod -
uct range effects, the slowdown in growth in 
the United Kingdom, and the significant appre -
ciation of the euro against the British pound in 
the years before probably had a dampening ef -
fect here. Exports to France were also slightly 
down on the year, with the decline in other 
transport equipment also playing a role.5 By 
contrast, exporters maintained the successful 
performance they had achieved in the Nether -
lands and Italy in 2017. The increase in revenue 
from German exports to central and eastern 
European countries outside the euro area was 
higher than average, as in previous years.

tries outside the EU was also more subdued on Weaker rise in

backs have contributed to the decline in the 
payout ratio in Germany, it is possible to cal-
culate a payout ratio adjusted for share buy-
backs.16 While there have been some years 
in which this ratio was considerably higher 
than the standard measure, the differences 
were immaterial on average for the 1998-
2017 period. Arguably, then, share buybacks 
did not contribute to the trend decline in 
the payout ratio in Germany.
Conclusion
In conclusion, out of the fi  ve hypotheses in-
vestigated in this box, just one – the delev-
eraging theory  – is identifi  ed as having a 
statistically signifi  cant and quantitatively im-
portant infl  uence on the decline in the pay-
out ratio. Given that debt levels in Ger-
many’s non- fi  nancial corporate sector are now relatively low by international stand-
ards, there is little reason for enterprises to 
reduce their payout ratios any further.17 
Now that enterprises are very soundly cap-
italised, it would certainly be plausible for 
them to further increase the share of profi  ts 
they distribute in the future (as the national 
accounts data have been indicating since 
2015).18

the whole on average in 2018 compared to 
2017. Even so, broken down by sales region, 
developments were fairly heterogeneous. After 
increasing sharply the year before, exports to 
the United States recorded a moderate rise; the 
appre ciation of the euro against the US dollar is 
also likely to have played a role here. In add -
ition, exports to other major destinations out -
side the EU expanded only slightly. Exports to 
Russia, too, were only marginally higher than in 
the previous year, in which they had risen extra -
ordinarily sharply. Furthermore, exports to the 
OPEC countries showed a further decline. Ex -
ports to Asia, on the other hand, recorded 
comparatively strong growth. Sales to China 
rose sharply, although the slower pace of eco -
nomic activity there probably had an impact on 
German exporters. Export revenue in the South 
and East Asian emerging market economies ex -
panded sharply again. Foreign business with 
Japan was also fairly positive.
The slower pace of global trade in goods 
affected  German manufacturers to varying 
degrees . In price- adjusted terms, foreign trade 
in consumer goods was just as brisk as in 2017. 
The very sharp increase in sales of pharmaceut -
ical products probably also contributed to this. 
Although Germany’s exports of intermediate 
goods and major categories of capital goods 
also expanded, their rate of growth was dis -
tinctly lower than in the previous year due to 
weakening upward momentum in global in -
dustrial activity. Exports of computers, elec -
tronic and optical products as well as electrical 
equipment registered strong gains. In addition, 
exports of machinery rose comparatively 
sharply. By contrast, there was a clear decline in 
exports of motor vehicles and motor vehicle 
parts. Among other reasons, this was probably 
due to the difficulties encountered by the Ger -
man automotive sector with regard to the new 
EU- wide emissions tests.6 This is likely to have 
been compounded by dampening effects from 
the demand side, especially in key markets for Demand for

the German automotive industry. For instance, 
there was a significant drop in exports of motor 
vehicles to the United States, as in the previous 
year.
Buoyant domestic demand in Germany meant 
there was demand for a wide range of prod -
ucts from foreign manufacturers. Imports of 
consumer goods continued to record lively 
growth. Imports of traditional capital goods 
such as machinery expanded considerably in 
the wake of the strong increase in demand for 
machinery and equipment in Germany. Com -
puters, electronic and optical products as well 
as electrical equipment were also in high de -
mand. By contrast, imports of motor vehicles 
and motor vehicle parts showed below average 
growth. This could have been due, among 
other things, to a certain degree of temporary 
spending restraint on the part of domestic 
buyers and, indirectly, the decline in motor ve -
hicle exports. Producers of intermediate goods 
recorded very strong growth in revenue from 
exports to Germany. Moreover, the value of 
energy  imports rose extremely sharply. How -
ever, this was essentially due to the increase in 
the prices of these products.
From a regional perspective, imports from 
other EU countries as well as from countries 
outside the EU went up sharply in 2018. Manu -facturers in the euro area’s partner countries 
saw revenue from their business with Germany 
expand to a significant degree, outstripping the 
previous year’s performance. The pick- up in 
import  demand from Germany benefited the 
major suppliers –  with Italy and the Nether -
lands recording the largest increase overall – 
as well as the majority of smaller trading part -
ners, which also significantly stepped up their 
deliveries. Furthermore, imports from central 
and eastern European EU countries went up 
relatively sharply, continuing the trend from the 
previous years. By contrast, imports from the 
United Kingdom were only slightly higher than 
their level in the previous year, when they had 
increased strongly. Major suppliers outside the 
EU also generated higher export revenues with 
Germany. However, the increases were gener -
ally lower than in the previous year.
Invisible current transactions
From Germany’s perspective, cross- border 
trade in services continued to post a deficit. 
Interestingly, the pace of growth in both im -
ports and exports of services was very moder -
ate compared to the strong performance of 
recent years. In contrast to both preceding 
years, the deficit decreased distinctly in 2018.

vices provided by non- residents came to €19½ 
billion more than demand for services in Ger -
many by non- residents.
The decline in the deficit in the year under re -
view was solely due to the increased revenue 
from trade in services with other euro area 
countries, against which Germany’s services 
account  traditionally shows a deficit. Business- 
related sectors and sectors oriented to eco -
nomic activity, such as manufacturing, trans -
port, communication and IT services, played a 
major role in this. By contrast, Germany re -
corded a slightly lower surplus in the services 
balance vis- à- vis non- euro area countries.Trade in services was brisker in 2018 than in the 
year before, particularly in services that tend to 
be knowledge- based, such as communication 
and IT services and the use of intellectual prop -
erty, but also in the transport sector. These 
three sub- accounts significantly helped to im -
prove the services account balance overall. By 
contrast, other business services, which include 
research and development, professional, tech -
nical and commercial services as well as man -
agement consulting services, showed very little 
momentum on the revenue and the expend -
iture side alike. Over the last decade, these ser -
vices had shown very sharp growth in some 
cases as a result of the increasingly international 
division of labour in the services sector, too. 
The same applies to cross- border fees for finan -
cial and insurance services.
The largest item in the services sector in abso -
lute terms is cross- border travel, which re -
corded a deficit of €43½ billion. Sharp in -
creases in residents’ income over the past few 
years saw travel expenditure go up by almost 
one- tenth in 2017. This high level was exceeded 
by only a small margin in 2018. There was 
barely any change in terms of travel destin -
ations. Since Germany became somewhat 
more attractive as a travel destination for non-  
residents, the deficit remained virtually un -
changed on the year.
The primary income received by Germany from 
the rest of the world, which comprises com -
pensation of employees, investment income 
and other primary income, exceeded payments 
in this item to the rest of the world by €91½ 
billion last year. As cross-  border flows in com -
pensation of employees and in other primary 
income offset each other to result in small bal -
ances as in previous years, net revenue from 
international investment was the main source 
of primary income. According to provisional 
calculations, this went up by €11 billion to 
€93½ billion in the reporting year, having al -

that.7 Although income to residents from their 
investments abroad rose only slightly, payments 
to non- resident investors and lenders – particu -
larly in the area of portfolio investment – fell 
perceptibly year on year. At the same time, the 
yield level for both assets and liabilities declined 
further.8 However, because the decline in hold -
ings of foreign assets by residents was smaller 
than that for liabilities, the yield differential 
widened to the advantage of German invest -
ors. Together with the further increase in net 
external assets, this contributed to the higher 
investment income surplus.
The cross- border secondary income balance 
recorded  a deficit of €47½ billion in 2018. This 
was lower than the deficit in 2017, which was 
strongly affected by one- off effects from pri -
vate unilateral transfers to the rest of the world. 
Compared with 2016, in which there were no 
such one- off effects, the deficit in secondary 
income rose by almost €7 billion in the report -
ing year. Around one- third of this increase was 
attributable to the secondary income balance 
in the general government sector, mainly as a 
result of higher expenditure abroad. This was 
caused by the hike in Germany’s contributions 
to the EU budget, which are based on gross 
national income. Two- thirds of the increase 
stemmed from the private sector, with one- off 
effects from private unilateral transfers to the 
rest of the world persisting in 2018, too, in 
some cases. The rise in the number of personal 
transfers – in this case, remittances – over the 
last two years also goes some way towards ex -
plaining the increase in private transfers to the 
rest of the world.
Financial transactions
In 2018, Germany’s current account surplus 
was offset by net capital exports in the amount 
of €225½ billion, a drop of €57½ billion from 
the previous year’s level, with all financial trans -
actions segments recording net outflows of 
funds to the rest of the world.Portfolio investment
Portfolio investment generated net capital ex -
ports of €113 billion in 2018, compared with 
196½ billion one year earlier. This substantially 
lower figure was caused, on the one hand, by 
reduced demand for foreign securities on the 
part of German investors and, on the other 
hand, by less divestment of German portfolio 
assets on the part of foreign investors than in 
2017. The decline in demand for foreign secur -
ities may have been shaped by the expectations 
of market participants with regard to global 
growth, which were gradually reined in over Partial absence

the course of last year. Geopolitical risks may 
also have played a role in German investors’ 
decision to invest less strongly in foreign paper. 
These risks encompassed, for instance, the 
trade dispute between the United States and 
China as well as the ongoing uncertainty sur -
rounding Brexit.
Last year saw domestic investors acquire a net 
€68 billion worth of foreign securities, putting 
net purchases well below their level one year 
earlier. While in 2017 German investors con -
tinued to chiefly focus on buying mutual fund 
shares, in 2018 their main focus of investment 
was interest- bearing instruments. Despite this, 
they acquired bonds worth €44½ billion, keep -
ing demand only slightly above the previous 
year’s level. Euro- denominated bonds were 
subject to greater demand from domestic in -
vestors, a development which, among other 
factors, may have been attributable to the 
wider yield spread of long- term government 
bonds of individual euro area member states 
over Bunds. Thanks to the higher yields on 
offer, these bonds are likely to have become 
more attractive to investors, notwithstanding 
the additional risks they can entail. Conversely, 
German investors sold foreign currency bonds 
in the amount of €3 billion in 2018, having pur -
chased foreign currency bonds for €18½ billion 
just one year previously. Moreover, German in -
vestors shed foreign money market paper to 
the tune of €4½ billion from their portfolios 
after already having started to dispense with 
such short- term paper just one year before, 
owing to the widespread low short- term inter -
est rates that have led to less than attractive 
returns.
Foreign shares continued to be popular with 
German investors in 2018. However, at €9½ 
billion, net purchases were down on the previ -
ous year. After two years of posting significant 
gains, the international stock markets saw 
share prices plummet in some cases in the past 
year, prompting investors to exercise restraint 
with regard to equities.German

In 2018, German investors also stepped up 
their indirect investment in securities, buying 
€18½ billion worth of them through foreign in -
vestment funds. Nevertheless, they acquired far 
fewer mutual fund shares than in 2017. Mutual 
fund shares were purchased mainly from Lux -
embourg and Ireland, where a large proportion 
of the companies that sell funds in Germany 
are based. From these locations, they invest 
funds on a worldwide basis, for which reason 
no regional classification of the actual target 
countries is possible.
As regards financial flows in the opposite direc -
tion, at a level of €45 billion, foreign investors 
parted with far fewer German securities net in 
2018 than in 2017. This was true, inter alia, for 
public sector bonds, where such sales by for -
eign investors amounted to €51 billion in 2018. 
This was well below the previous year’s level. In 
this context, the gradual reduction of the vol -
ume of assets purchased under the APP is likely 
to have played a pivotal role. At the beginning 
of 2018, the Eurosystem initially scaled back its 
monthly asset purchases from a prior rate of 
€60 billion net to €30 billion, before trimming 
them again to €15 billion as of the fourth quar -
ter onward. Accordingly, the Bundesbank’s 
own purchases of assets, which, to a significant 
extent, were concluded with foreign counter -
parties, also contracted.
In contrast to public sector bonds, interest-  
bearing securities issued by private entities 
domiciled in Germany met with positive de -
mand from foreign investors. This meant that 
there was a reversal from the situation in 2017 
on the back of a strong demand for bank 
bonds. While foreign investors in that year had 
continued to unload German bonds from their 
portfolios, in 2018 they availed themselves of 
securities of this kind for €6½ billion, also pur -
chasing domestic money market paper total -
ling €2 billion. Foreign investors, meanwhile, 
divested themselves of bonds issued by Ger -
man firms to the tune of €3½ billion.With respect to shares, purchases by foreign in -
vestors in 2018 resulted in inflows of €6½ bil -
lion, as opposed to the previous year’s result

fifths of the recorded capital outflows were ac -
counted for by futures transactions, with op -
tions generating the remaining one- fifth. Cross- 
border forward and futures contracts relating 
to electricity and gas, which are also recorded 
under financial derivatives, resulted in net cap -
ital imports totalling €½ billion. Monetary 
finan cial institutions constituted the majority of 
the domestic counterparties engaging in inter -
nationally traded financial derivatives.
Foreign direct investment
Global direct investment flows declined in 2018 
for a third year in succession. This deterioration 
was triggered by a number of factors, including 
the worsening trade dispute between the 
United States and China, uncertainty about the 
specific aspects of the United Kingdom’s with -
drawal from the EU, as well as the reform of 
the taxation rules for US enterprises with affili -
ates located abroad. Tax reforms in the USA 
caused much of that country’s direct invest -
ment capital abroad to be repatriated, which, 
in and of itself, had the effect of diminishing 
net direct investment flows. The return flows 
recorded of late represented previous years’ 
profits generated abroad that had not been 
distributed but instead reinvested in foreign 
branches, thus enabling parent companies 
located  in the United States to evade taxation.
The capital flows heading to the United States 
as a result of the repatriation of reinvested 
earnings overshadowed other developments in 
the arena of global direct investment in 2018. 
Corporate acquisitions and mergers went up by 
19% in terms of value in 2018. The number of 
proclaimed start-  ups of commercial affiliates 
located  abroad, known as greenfield invest -
ments, increased by as much as 29%.

2018 had sunk by around 19% to a figure of 
US$1.2 trillion.10
In contrast to the downward trend witnessed 
in direct investment in other advanced econ -
omies, international capital links with German 
involvement expanded once more. In this con -
text, German enterprises significantly increased 
their foreign investment, with large scale direct 
investment in Germany occurring in parallel to 
this.
Overall, German net capital exports from direct 
investment in 2018 came to €43½ billion, com -
pared with €48½ billion over the preceding 12 
months. This result stemmed from German FDI 
abroad, which rose by €9½ billion to €132½ 
billion to reach an all- time high. Domestic com -
panies boosted their equity capital abroad par -
ticularly sharply (€140 billion),11 and a sizeable 
role was played by cross- border mergers and 
acquisitions.12
By contrast, German enterprises saw inflows of 
funds amounting to €7½ billion via intra- group 
credit transactions. This reflected the fact that 
foreign affiliates had been redeeming financial 
credits granted to them by their German parent 
company.
Direct investment relationships, which tend to 
take a more long- term perspective, can be 
motivated  by a variety of factors. This is dem -
onstrated by the annual survey of the Associ -
ation of German Chambers of Commerce and 
Industry (DIHK) regarding its member enter -
prises operating in the manufacturing sector, 
which, as the survey shows, have exhibited 
great consistency in terms of their strategic ob -
jectives in recent years. In the second quarter 
of 2018, once again just under half of all enter -
prises cited the setting up or expansion of sales 
and customer services as their main reason for 
investing abroad, followed by foreign produc -
tion sites in order to access markets and cost- 
cutting potential.13Germany:

of payments can, however, differ from that recorded by

are not directly comparable.

The relationship between domestic corporate savings and 
foreign direct investment, as well as the role of reinvested 
earnings
For years now, “Germans” have been sav-
ing more than they invest. This savings sur-
plus is refl  ected in net capital exports. A 
sectoral analysis shows that non- fi  nancial 
corporations play an important role with re-
gard to savings surpluses in Germany, al-
though the positive net lending/ net bor-
rowing position has been declining slightly 
since 2016.1 Back in 2001, the difference 
between savings and investment was still 
negative for non- fi  nancial corporations. 
From then until 2016, this net lending/ net 
borrowing position rose relatively steadily. 
In this context, not just funding opportun-
ities via capital markets (e.g. through the 
issuance of equities and bonds) were im-
portant but also the low interest rate envir-
onment. It is in this connection that the role 
played by foreign direct investment in cor-
porate savings is also discussed.2 This article 
examines the extent to which a potential 
relationship exists between German foreign 
direct investment and the net lending/ net 
borrowing position of domestic enterprises, 
and the question of what factors affect do-
mestic parent companies’ reinvested earn-
ings with foreign affi   liates. Unlike domestic 
fi  xed asset formation, investment abroad 
does not have a direct impact on the do-
mestic savings- investment gap (net lending/ 
net borrowing). However, foreign direct in-
vestment enterprises usually generate 
profi  ts that are also refl  ected in the parent 
company’s profi  ts reported in Germany, ir-
respective of whether they are distributed 
to the parent company or are retained by 
the affi   liate.3 The part of the corporate 
profi  ts that is not distributed but reinvested 
represents the savings generated by that 
company. At the same time, the retained 
earnings of a foreign affi   liate increase direct investment abroad. Hence, an indirect rela-
tionship may come about between foreign 
direct investment and the savings by the 
German parent company.
Yet looking at the relationship between for-
eign direct investment and corporate sav-
ings purely in accounting terms does not go 
far enough. This approach only indicates ex 
post that a relationship may potentially exist 
– but not necessarily. Since it may be as-
sumed that international enterprises are 
characterised by strategic corporate plan-
ning, however, there may also be economic 
reasons for the idea that the (planned) cor-
porate savings might be affected by in-
tended foreign direct investment. For ex-
ample, it is conceivable that enterprises 
save more specifi  cally because they would 
like to engage in foreign direct investment.
This hypothesis can be assessed economet-
rically in a number of ways. A Bundesbank 
estimate with macroeconomic variables ini-
tially provides no indication of a systematic 
correlation between German direct invest-
ment abroad and domestic corporate sav-
ings. However, this does not rule out the 
possibility that such a correlation might 
exist at the enterprise level. On aggregate, 
it is possible that, at the macro level, a sys-

3 In 2018, the foreign affi   liates of German enterprises 
generated earnings totalling an estimated €92.5 bil-
lion. Of this amount, the foreign affi   liates retained 
€31.5 billion and distributed the remainder to the par-
ent companies. By comparison, the savings of non- 
fi  nancial corporations in Germany came to €101.6 bil-
lion in 2018.Deutsche Bundesbank

tematic correlation can no longer be ob-
served owing to the heterogeneity of cor-
porate decisions, a small number of obser-
vations, or other disruptive factors. At the 
micro level, the Bundesbank’s corporate 
balance sheet statistics (Unternehmens-
bilanzstatistik, or Ustan) enable an estimate 
of individual enterprises’ corporate savings. 
A possible and readily available measure of 
corporate savings is the change in the 
equity ratio.4 A methodologically more ac-
curate alternative can also be to calculate 
savings in the form of retained profi  ts.5 In 
this case, however, the information needed 
for the calculation is available only to a 
limited extent.6 Both measures are con-
sidered below.
The datasets on which the estimate is based 
are the Microdatabase Direct investment 
(MiDi) and Ustan. For this, the dataset from 
the research paper by Goldbach et al. (2019) 
is used.7 The time period covers the years 
2000 to 2013. Propensity score matching is 
used to identify two groups of enterprises 
that are similar with regard to various 
enterprise- specifi  c traits. There is only one 
major difference: whereas one group set up 
a new foreign affi   liate in one year (group 
with new foreign affi   liates), the other did 
not (control group). This method can be 
deployed  to isolate the effect of the (new) 
foreign direct investment.8 Subsequently, a 
check is carried out to ascertain whether 
there is a signifi  cant difference in the change 
in the equity ratio of the two groups (as a 
measure of the corporate savings).
The estimation results demonstrate that the 
changes in the two groups are not signifi  -
cantly different from each other (see the 
above table). Alternatively, the corporate 
savings for the years 2007 to 2013 are cal-
culated on the basis of the annual surpluses 
and distributed dividends (relative to equity). 
Here, too, the estimation results show no signifi  cant difference. Thus, there is no indi-
cation at the enterprise level either that the 
establishment (or acquisition) of a foreign 
affi   liate would entail an increase in corpor-
ate savings.
A further estimate examines which country- 
specifi  c factors affect the amount of re-
4 The equity ratio can change, however, irrespective of 
the enterprise’s savings. For example, the issuance of 
new shares increases the capital of an enterprise, but it 
does not constitute a saving. In addition, the equity 
ratio is also affected by the denominator (sum of 
equity and liabilities). Foreign direct investment can 
lead to an expansion of liabilities, thereby increasing 
total assets.

saving glut in the aftermath of the global fi  nancial cri-
sis, International Finance Discussion Papers, No 1150.
6 The dividend payments are available for only some 
of the enterprises. Based on them, payout ratios can 
be determined on an annual basis which are then as-
sumed for all enterprises. The observed measure thus 
varies between the individual enterprises only in terms 
of the annual surpluses, while the calculated share of 
retained earnings may also change over time.

invested earnings at a foreign affi   liate. The 
reinvested earnings are measured relative to 
the stock of direct investment in order to 
take size effects into account. Information, 
taken from the balance of payments statis-
tics, on dividends paid out by foreign affi   li-
ates to their domestic parent companies is 
linked to the balance sheet data from the 
MiDi database. The combined data are 
available for the years 1999 to 2015.
The following variables of the partner coun-
try serve as potential macroeconomic deter-
minants: real economic growth, the nom-
inal tax rate (tax rate), the log real gross 
domestic product (GDP) per capita (per 
capita GDP), the infl  ation rate (infl  ation), 
private credit relative to nominal GDP 
(fi  nancing  conditions), the log labour force 
(labour), public debt relative to GDP (public 
debt) and the freedom/ restriction of capital 
movements (Chinn- Ito index). In addition, time and country fi  xed effects are included 
in the estimation.
Only the real economic growth of the part-
ner country has a signifi  cant (positive) im-
pact on reinvested earnings (see the adja-
cent table). Domestic enterprises evidently 
tend to expand their presence in rapidly 
growing economies by injecting equity cap-
ital in the form of retained earnings; the fa-
vourable economic situation in these coun-
tries puts them in a better position to do so. 
All other macroeconomic variables, on the 
other hand, have no signifi  cant impact on 
the reinvested earnings. It follows from this 
that country- specifi  c factors, apart from a 
country’s economic and growth prospects, 
have very little impact on the amount of re-
invested earnings on the ground. However, 
this does not rule out the possibility that 
they affect enterprises’ investment deci-
sions on the whole.Foreign determinants for the ratio

Of the preferred target regions, the euro area 
was able to strengthen its position, according 
to the survey, as evidenced by the figures on 
direct investment included in the balance of 
payments. Together, the other member states 
of the euro area accounted for just under two- 
thirds of domestic enterprises’ direct invest -
ment. Around three- quarters of German for -
eign investment in the euro area was focused 
on the financial centres of the Netherlands, Ire -
land and Luxembourg.14 Meanwhile, the United 
Kingdom lost its 2017 standing as the main 
destination for German direct investment 
among other EU countries and found itself 
facing  capital withdrawals. As outlined above, 
this may be a product of the uncertainty eman -
ating from the UK’s planned Brexit. Outside 
Europe, the United States proved to be a major 
target country.
Those German enterprises that ramped up their 
equity capital abroad came from various 
branches of industry. Constituting more than 
one- third of the total, providers of professional 
and technical services were responsible for the 
lion’s share, with holding companies occupying 
a prominent position here. Just under one- third 
of the equity capital15 was attributable to enter -
prises from the area of financial and insurance 
services, and the same amount again was 
attrib utable to the manufacturing sector. In the 
case of the latter, manufacturers of pharma -
ceutical products, as well as of transport equip -
ment played an instrumental role.
Foreign companies stepped up their provision 
of fresh direct investment funds to associated 
enterprises domiciled in Germany, channelling 
net inflows of €89 billion to them. This repre -
sented an increase of €15 billion compared 
with the previous year. As for capital inflows, 
intra- group lending (€76 billion) continued to 
dominate proceedings and, once again, the 
driving force in this regard came from foreign 
subsidiaries granting financial credits to their 
German parent companies. These totalled €68 
billion, thus achieving a new record high. These 
reverse flows are often the result of capital market business involving German enterprises’ 
financing subsidiaries, whereby securities are 
issued  abroad and the proceeds are forwarded 
to the parent companies in Germany. German 
groups evidently took extensive advantage of 
the favourable market conditions in the last 
year as a way of absorbing funds. Moreover, 
foreign owners also boosted the equity capital 
they provided to German branches by €13½ 
billion.
In terms of country of origin, euro area firms 
represented the largest component in 2018, at 
around 85%, with more than half of all direct 
investment inflows to Germany coming from 
the Netherlands. Dutch- based financial subsid -
iaries, in particular, provided their German par -
ent companies with capital. In 2018, these 
reverse  flows also played a decisive role with 
respect to capital inflows deriving from Ireland 
and the United States. Further significant cap -
ital inflows originated in Switzerland, where, 
first and foremost, affiliated companies granted 
loans to their German sister companies. By 
contrast, Chinese enterprises did not play an 
important role as investors in Germany in 2018. 
In previous years they had, for the most part, 
made investments in foreign countries other 
than Germany, despite having executed some 
high- profile acquisitions on German turf.
Other investment
Other investment, comprising financial and 
trade credits (where these do not constitute a 
part of direct investment) as well as bank de -
posits and other assets, resulted in net capital 
exports of €45½ billion in 2018, up from €27½ 
billion in 2017.Most investment

14 The aforementioned countries are major holding loca -
tions for internationally active enterprises. As the balance 
of payments only captures the immediate counterparties of 
cross- border transactions, it is not possible to identify 
where the transferred funds are ultimately invested.
15 Reinvested earnings cannot be assigned to individual 
economic sectors and were therefore not taken into ac -
count when making this calculation. By the same token, 
the shares only relate to classifiable net transfers.Deutsche Bundesbank

A decisive role was played by outflows of funds 
from monetary financial institutions (MFIs) (€86 
billion). On the one hand, they upped their 
lending to foreign counterparties, with a large 
portion of this taking the form of long- term 
finan cial credits to foreign enterprises and 
households. On the other hand, they boosted 
their deposits with foreign banks – primarily 
with group- affiliated institutions. At the same 
time, their cross-  border liabilities contracted, 
not least because foreign group- affiliated insti -
tutions reduced their short- term deposits with 
German banks.Contrasting with the above, the Bundesbank 
posted net inflows of funds in the amount of 
€40 billion, largely on account of a sharp in -
crease in the Bundesbank’s external liabilities 
(€97 billion). Here, monetary authorities and 
commercial banks domiciled outside the euro 
area, in particular, chose to boost their de -
posits. In the case of monetary authorities, this 
item includes, for example, all deposits received 
by the Bundesbank from non- euro area central 
banks as part of the range of central bank ser -
vices it offers.
As for commercial banks, the APP is likely to 
have played a key role: Sales of securities by 
foreign investors to other Eurosystem central 
banks are often effected via Germany. This ac -
tivity causes liquidity to flow to Germany, 
where it then partly remains, taking the form of 
deposits parked at the Bundesbank.16 A num -
ber of commercial banks domiciled in the Euro -
pean Economic Area (EEA), but not, however, 
in the EU, maintain an account at the Bundes -
bank. These accounts are included in the exter -
nal position of the Bundesbank.
On the back of the APP , the Bundesbank’s 
TARGET2   claims vis-  à- vis the European Central 
Bank also rose. However, at €59 billion, this in -
crease remained well below the figure recorded 
in 2017 (€153 billion). This lower value is in line 
with a gradual reduction in the volume of 
secur ities purchases in the course of 2018.17 
Last year, the Bundesbank’s liabilities vis- à- vis 
the ECB arising from the allocation of euro 
banknotes within the Eurosystem went up by 
€42 billion. Hence, the Bundesbank’s net claims 
vis- à- vis the ECB arising from the two balance 
sheet items rose only relatively moderately by 
€17½ billion.Capital

Non- banks attracted modest net inflows of 
funds from abroad over the past year (€½ bil -
lion), reflecting the net inflows accruing to gen -
eral government (€11½ billion). Above all, the 
latter reduced its deposits held abroad and 
scaled back its cross- border lending. By con -
trast, enterprises and households experienced 
outflows of funds (€11 billion). In particular, 
they augmented their overnight deposits held 
at foreign commercial banks.
Reserve assets
Driven by transactions, the Bundesbank’s re -
serve assets increased by €½ billion in 2018. This increase was attributable to Germany’s 
higher reserve position with the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF).
The international reserve holdings are also in -
fluenced by balance sheet adjustments which, 
in compliance with internationally agreed ac -
counting standards, are not recognised in the 
balance of payments. The revaluation also gen -
erated an increase in 2018 (€6 billion), due in 
large part to rising gold prices and the higher 
valuation of the securities owing to exchange 
rate changes. All in all, the year 2018 saw the 
carrying amount of Germany’s reserve assets 
climb by €6½ billion to €173 billion as at

Cash demand in the shadow economy
Cash payments are simple, secure, efficient and anonymous, which is why consumers use cash to 
pay for almost three- quarters of their purchases at the point of sale. At the same time, these char -
acteristics also make cash a focal point for potential illegal uses. An oft- voiced opinion in the 
public debate is that cash promotes the shadow economy and is used as a means of financing 
crime. There are calls for regulatory measures to restrict the use of cash in view of what is pre -
sumed to be its widespread use for illegal purposes. Against this backdrop, the present article 
makes an empirical study of the use of cash in the shadow economy as well as in connection with 
related areas such as money laundering, terrorist financing and other criminal activities.
The illegal nature of such activities means that it is very difficult to provide hard research- based 
evidence about the scale of the cash demand resulting from the shadow economy and criminal -
ity. Empirical studies of the shadow economy are therefore subject to more than average uncer -
tainty, meaning that all results should be interpreted with caution. It is often the case that anec -
dotal evidence is drawn on, taking as its direct starting point the volume of cash in circulation or 
the demand for large- denomination banknotes. The currency demand approach is a model 
framework for the empirically founded study of the scale of illicit cash usage. Our own economet -
ric estimations adopting this approach examine whether cash lodgements made at the Bundes -
bank’s branches and the estimated domestic demand for euro banknotes in Germany are linked 
to activities in the shadow economy.
However, cash is not the sole payment instrument used either in the shadow economy or to 
finance crime. As part of the general trend towards digitalisation, alternative payment instru -
ments are gaining significant ground, particularly in connection with settlement via the internet 
or darknet.Deutsche Bundesbank

Cash use in Germany
The Bundesbank and the other central banks of 
the Eurosystem are collectively responsible for 
the issuance of banknotes in the euro area. At 
the end of 2018, the volume of euro banknotes 
in circulation totalled around €1,230 billion, of 
which approximately €690 billion was issued 
by the Bundesbank (see the chart below).1 On 
an average of the past decade, the volume of 
euro banknotes in circulation increased by 
4.9% per annum and therefore at a faster pace 
than nominal economic output in the euro 
area. Over the same period, the Bundesbank’s 
cumulative net issuance increased each year by 
as much as 7.7% on average. Economic agents 
are thus demanding cash on a significant and 
growing scale. However, since cash can be 
used without documentation, there are natur -
ally no complete statistical data available on 
the reasons for and scale of the use of cash as 
a payment instrument and a store of value.2As a first step, the motives behind the demand 
for euro banknotes at the Bundesbank can be 
investigated by breaking them down into the 
components of foreign demand, domestic 
transaction balances and domestic hoarding.3 
An estimated two- thirds of the Bundesbank’s 
cumulative net issuance of euro banknotes 
were in circulation abroad at the end of 2017. 
According to estimates, domestic cash users 
were hoarding just over 20% of cumulative net 
issuance, while slightly less than 10% was 
being held as transaction balances. Studies of 
payment behaviour among the general public 
in Germany are also available.4 74% of transac -
tions at the point of sale are performed with 
cash, and a further 19% by debit card. In terms 
of turnover, cash payments account for a share 
of 48%, while debit card payments account for 
35%. At present, therefore, cash is the most 
used instrument in consumers’ everyday pay -
ments, but cashless payment instruments are 
becoming increasingly important for conduct -
ing transactions at the point of sale.
These studies do not make a distinction be -
tween the legal and illegal use of cash. How -
ever, it is vital to have information on the sig -
nificance of illicit motives for cash demand, as 
cash demand in the shadow economy has 
been in the spotlight for some time. The belief 
that cash is being used on a large scale for 
illegal  purposes is used for justifying regulatory Reasons for and

measures to restrict the use of cash.5 One con -
crete policy measure restricting the use of cash 
consists in ceilings for cash payments, which 
have been introduced in a number of European 
countries to combat the shadow economy, 
money laundering and terrorist finan cing (see 
the box on p. 46). Against this backdrop, this 
article examines the illegal use of cash.6
Illegal use of payment 
instruments 
Shadow economy
Illegal uses of payment instruments refer to 
those uses where the surrounding circum -
stances are not consistent with established law. 
This includes  the use of cash in what is known 
as the shadow economy. According to one 
common definition, the shadow economy en -
compasses the production of goods and ser -
vices that is concealed from the authorities in 
order to avoid financial or other burdens.7 The 
table above shows examples of activities in the 
shadow economy. Here, the differing forms 
taken by the shadow economy are distin -
guished along two dimensions: the legal status 
of an activity, which is either legal when taken 
in isolation or already illegal in itself, and the 
kind of consideration received, which may, for example, be a monetary transaction in cash 
or  a non- monetary transaction (e.g. helping 
neighbours).
Activities in the shadow economy are carried 
out covertly and are thus, at least partly, not 
captured in the official statistics. Various esti -
mation methods are used in the literature to 
determine the size of the shadow economy.8

Ceilings for cash payments
Cash payment ceilings are restrictions which 
limit the amounts that can be paid in cash; 
above these threshold values it is no longer 
permissible to conduct transactions in cash, 
and cashless payment instruments have to 
be used instead. As cashless payment in-
struments are more easily traceable, ceilings 
for cash payments are designed to help in 
combating tax evasion in the shadow econ-
omy, money laundering and the fi  nancing 
of terrorism.1
So far, 12 EU Member States have intro-
duced national restrictions on cash pay-
ments which differ, above all, in the amount 
of the threshold value. The ceilings range at 
present from €500 in Greece to the equiva-
lent of around €15,000 in Poland and Cro-
atia. However, the categories of persons as 
well as the sectors affected by the restric-
tions differ from country to country. At 
present, they chiefl  y affect transactions be-
tween businesses or transactions between 
businesses and private individuals. No EU 
Member State imposes restrictions on the 
possession of cash. Moreover, in some 
Member States differing restrictions for resi-
dents and non- residents apply. For (tax) 
residents in France, for example, there has 
been a cash payment ceiling of €1,000 in 
force since 2015 (previously €3,000); non- 
residents, on the other hand, can conduct 
cash transactions up to €15,000.
The European Commission recently looked 
into the introduction of an EU- wide stand-
ard ceiling for cash payments with the aim 
of combating the fi  nancing of terrorism. 
The European Commission came to the 
conclusion that EU- wide cash payment ceil-
ings would not, at present, suitably address 
the problem of terrorist fi  nancing and, in 
June 2018, announced that any plans for an 
EU- wide restriction on cash payments were 
not going to be taken any further at the present time.2 It based its decision on two 
public consultations it conducted/ commis-
sioned3 which also involved affected pro-
fessional groups and institutions.4 At just 
under 95% of those surveyed, a broad ma-
jority of the general public came out against 
an EU restriction on cash payments.5 Doubts 
about its effectiveness were among the 
arguments  cited by the participants in the 
survey. All things considered, the European 
Commission came to the conclusion that 
ceilings on cash payments will not, as a 
rule, deter criminals from committing a 
criminal act, especially in the case of of-
fences in connection with tax evasion or 
terrorist fi  nancing.6
When assessing restrictions on cash pay-
ments in terms of combating criminal activ-
ity, consideration should be given not only 
to their effectiveness but also to other 
aspects .7 For instance, the introduction of 
a ceiling for cash payments represents an 
encroachment on consumers’ freedom to 
choose the method of payment and risks a 
possible loss of confi  dence in the currency 
on the part of the general public.

7 Up to now, very few data have been available for an 
empirical analysis of the effectiveness of cash payment 
ceilings. International comparisons are also made more 
diffi   cult by the fact that cash payment limits have been 
introduced, in particular, by countries with a large 
shadow economy.Deutsche Bundesbank

Germany. The studies are based on different 
definitions of the shadow economy, which 
means that the results they produce are not 
always  directly comparable. Across the various 
studies, these estimates show the size of the 
shadow economy ranging between 2.4% and 
16.6% of gross domestic product (GDP) in Ger -
many. Relative to a GDP of around €3,300 bil -
lion in 2017, all other things being equal, these 
estimates reveal the size of the shadow econ -
omy to be between approximately €80 billion 
and €550 billion. The considerable range of es -
timation results thus far reflects their sensitivity 
to the chosen method of calculation. Overall, 
estimates based on public surveys9 are signifi -
cantly lower than macroeconomic estimates 
using, say, the currency demand approach10 or 
structural equation modelling.11 The size of the 
shadow economy is possibly underestimated in 
studies based on public surveys, as respondents 
may be unwilling to disclose information. A 
widely- held opinion in the literature, on the 
other hand, is that macroeconomic procedures 
could overestimate the size of the shadow 
economy.12 One reason for this, for instance, is 
that some analyses do not take into account 
foreign demand or the function of cash as a 
legal store of value.
Cash facilitates simple, secure, quick and an -
onymous payments, which also makes it a con -venient payment instrument for clandestine 
economic activities. The exchange of goods 
plays a role in the shadow economy, too, how -
ever. When producing fake invoices as a 
smokescreen for illicit work, a combination of 
cash and cashless payments is used.13 Along -
side illegal labour, the non- disclosure of income 
from goods trading represents a further form 
of shadow economy activity. In this context, in -
come is likely to be predominantly in the form 
of cash if stationary points of sale or invoices Actual

are manipulated in order to evade taxes. Such 
illegal goods trading could become increasingly 
internet- based given the general trend towards 
digitalisation, meaning that these transactions 
would be settled without cash. VAT fraud in 
online trading supports this view.14 The fact 
that the level of online drug trafficking re -
corded by the police in Germany in 2017 
showed a 24% increase on the year and ac -
counted for as much as 5% of all recorded of -
fences in this area is a further sign of increasing 
digitalisation in the shadow economy.15 Pay-
ments in the shadow economy can also be 
made via the official banking system – for ex -
ample, in cases where anonymity is created 
through the use of letterbox companies. This 
seems to happen often in carousel transactions 
involving the transfer of apparently legal money 
flows and input tax refunds. Alongside cash, 
cashless forms of settlement also play a role in 
the shadow economy.
Other potential illegal uses of 
payment instruments
Further unlawful uses of payment instruments 
occur, for example, in connection with un -
declared income from capital (e.g. dividends, 
interest),16 property crime (e.g. theft of pay -
ment instruments), various forms of white-  
collar crime (e.g. financing, insolvency, labour, 
competition and contribution- related offences), 
and corruption or cybercrime (e.g. phishing in 
online banking). Another term which is often 
discussed in connection with criminal activities 
is “money laundering”. This refers to illegally 
acquired assets – such as illicit earnings from 
criminal activities – being channelled into the 
legal financial and economic cycles.17 In add -
ition, the rise of Islamist terrorist groups has 
thrust the financing of terrorism further into 
the spotlight.18 Owing to the sparse availability 
of data, however, empirically reliable state -
ments on the scale of these other illegal areas 
can be made only to a very limited extent, if at 
all.In some of the areas mentioned, cash plays 
only a partial role or is not used at all. In cases 
of unreported income from capital, for ex -
ample, illegal money frequently appears to be 
channelled into countries which constitute an 
attractive destination on account of compara -
tively low rates of taxation, a high level of con -
fidentiality and secrecy and/ or less- developed 
financial market supervision/ regulation. It is es -
timated that 8% of the financial wealth of 
households worldwide, totalling US $7.6 tril -
lion, is held in such tax havens.19 Corruption 
represents another illegal use of payment in -
struments. 70% of all corruption cases re -
corded by police in 2017 were committed using 
cash.20 Non- cash benefits or other monetary 
assets accounted for just under 7% each. Cash 
therefore plays a significant role, although the 
use of cash is subject to major fluctuations over

16 Besides illicit work, illegal trading of goods and un -
declared income from capital, other forms of tax fraud or 
evasion are conceivable – for instance, income from the 
assignment of intangible assets, such as licences or rights. 
The evasion of other forms of tax, such as corporation tax 
or local business tax, is also possible, alongside the afore -
mentioned evasion of income tax and VAT.

18 Even though the sum total of terrorist financing is, by its 
very nature, unknown both on a global scale and in terms 
of Germany alone, a conceptual distinction needs to be 
made between the financing of individual terrorist attacks 
and that of entire terrorist groups. Significant sums primar -
ily arise in the case of the latter. The planning and imple -
mentation costs of the most recent terrorist attacks in 
Europe  are estimated to have been somewhere between 
less than €2,000 and €82,000. See Ecorys (2017), Study on

time (2016: 35%, 2015: 77%).21 In the context 
of terrorist activities, cash generally seems to 
be used for payments or smuggling.22 How -
ever, the formal financial system may also play 
an important role, such as when it comes to 
making credit transfers or taking out loans. The 
use of prepaid cards is often observed, too.23 
Added to these are informal banking systems 
(such as hawala) and crypto- tokens.
The impression that it is mainly or even exclu -
sively cash that is used for criminal purposes 
– and that, as a consequence, cash is typically 
used at the start of the money laundering pro -
cess to infiltrate the financial system – there -
fore has to be modified to account for all as -
pects. First, money laundering comprises not 
only cash- driven activities in the shadow econ -
omy, but also, for instance, the repatriation of 
assets resulting from the evasion of tax on cap -
ital income or from cybercrime. Second, to 
undertake shadow economy activities, elec -
tronic payment processes are increasingly com -
ing into question as described above, especially 
for settlement over the internet or darknet. In 
general, it seems that money laundering 
methods are also becoming more digital, for 
instance through the use of cryptocurrencies or 
“offshore instruments”.24 Since bank accounts 
serve as an interface between cash and cash -
less payments and offer the possibility of con -
verting cash into book money by making a de -
posit, or converting book money into cash by 
making a withdrawal, it is likely that, in many 
cases, illegal money will change its form mul -
tiple times during the money laundering pro -
cess. When evaluating the role of various pay -
ment instruments in the money laundering pro -
cess, it therefore seems appropriate to take an 
all- encompassing view of payment transac -
tions.
Extent of illegal use of cash 
in Germany
Based on these considerations, cash is – along -
side other means of payment and forms of money – also used for criminal purposes. How -
ever, as a result of the clandestine nature of 
illegal  activities, the precise extent of this can 
only be estimated and is subject to an above-  
average degree of uncertainty.
Estimates of illegal cash 
holdings  based on volume 
of cash in circulation
It is often argued that the overall volume of 
cash in circulation as well as the demand for 
large- denomination banknotes are greater than 
might be expected if cash were used solely for 
legal purposes. Conversely, this would suggest 
that the illegal use of cash is a widespread phe -
nomenon. To illustrate this argument, the table  
on p. 50 shows cash in circulation per inhabitant 
as well as the percentage of large- denomination 
banknotes in circulation for a range of currency 
areas. The demand for euro banknotes by de -
nomination is shown in greater detail in the 
chart on p. 50.

only slightly, if at all, from ordinary transactions. As a result, 
they attract little attention ahead of terrorist attacks, irre -

by using “brass- plate companies”, illegal money is often 
shifted back and forth between different countries before 
coming back into the possession of its true owner; for

cash holdings for transaction purposes.25 By 
way of an example, subtracting the estimated 
foreign demand from the value of Bundesbank- 
issued euro banknotes gives a domestic de -
mand of around €200 billion, or €2,500 per 
inhabitant, at the end of 2016. The available 
figures on credit institutions’ cash holdings 
(€26 billion), households’ estimated cash hold -
ings for transaction purposes (€13 billion),26 
and retailers’ estimated cash holdings (€2 bil -
lion) only partially account for this volume of 
cash in circulation.27 The remaining unex -
plained cash holdings could be held both as a 
legal store of value as well as for illegal pur -
poses.28 Without knowledge of the stock of 
cash held legally as a store of value, it is impos -

sumers could form cash reserves in order to cover expenses 
even in the event of unforeseen circumstances. Certain in -
vestors could doubt the stability of the banking and finan -
cial system and set aside cash for this reason. Cash is se -
cure central bank money and is therefore fundamentally 
immune to any default risk. One example of the fact that 
cash is held legally as a store of value on a substantial scale 
can be seen from developments in the demand for cash 
during the escalation of the financial crisis following the 
Lehman Brothers crisis in September 2008. October 2008 
saw an immense increase in the Bundesbank’s net outpay -
ments of €500 banknotes, which totalled €11.4 billion in 
that month. By comparison, cumulative net outpayments 
of that denomination in 2008 as a whole, excluding the 
month of October, amounted to €10.3 billion. See 
Deutsche Bundesbank, Demand for banknotes during the 
financial crisis, Monthly Report, June 2009, pp. 52-53.

sidual are unlikely to be very robust, as estimation errors in 
the other components have a knock- on effect on the esti -

The table and chart on p.  50 suggest that 
large- denomination banknotes comprise a sig -
nificant part of cash in circulation in the euro 
area as well as in other currency areas. How -
ever, the demand for large denominations 
alone cannot be used to support the conclu -
sion that cash is being used for illegal purposes, 
since these denominations are equally suitable 
as a legal store of value or for legal and illegal 
high- value payments. In particular, interpreting 
the Bundesbank’s cumulative net issuance is 
made more difficult by the fact that the bank -
notes that it issues also circulate abroad. In 
summary, anecdotal evidence drawn from the 
volume of cash in circulation or the demand for 
large- denomination banknotes is not appropri -
ate for quantifying illegal cash holdings.
One variant of the estimates that use the vol -
ume of cash in circulation as a starting point 
looks at what is known as the “cash- deposit 
ratio”, which is usually defined as the ratio of 
cash in circulation to sight deposits. This ap -
proach assumes that, excluding the impact of 
the shadow economy, cash is held in constant 
proportion to sight deposits. Unexplained rises 
in this cash- deposit ratio – compared with a 
“natural” cash- deposit ratio defined using a 
given base year – are interpreted as pointing to 
an illegal holding of cash.30 When applying this 
approach, choosing a base year is a particular 
challenge. Additional problems arise because a 
range of determinants – such as the interest 
rate, the level of economic output as well as 
innovations in payments and banking  – can, 
over time, change the ratio of cash in circula -
tion to sight deposits.31 Specific examples of 
relevant determinants are an increasing volume 
of cashless wage payments as well as the emer -
gence of ATMs.32 The cash- deposit ratio could, 
in principle, also rise following an increase in 
legal use of cash as a store of value. The chart 
above shows that variously defined cash-  
deposit ratios have been tending to decline in 
Germany over the past few decades. As a re -
sult, unexplained rises in the cash- deposit ratio, 
too, cannot be used to draw any conclusions 
regarding the use of cash in the shadow econ -omy.33 At least without adjustments, the cash- 
deposit ratio is therefore also unlikely to offer a 
suitable method for estimating the illegal cash 
demand.On the basis 
of demand 
for large- 
denomination 
banknotes, it is 
also not possible 
to draw any 
direct  conclu -
sion about the

Estimates using the currency 
demand approach
An alternative to these direct approaches is 
provided by economic research into the shadow 
economy in the form of the “currency demand 
approach”.34 The currency demand approach 
for analysing the shadow economy enhances 
traditional money demand models35 by the 
addition of variables that are designed to cap -
ture the impact of illegal activities on the de -
mand for cash. Since it is not possible to ob -
serve the scale of the shadow economy and 
other unlawful forms of behaviour, indicators 
that should be connected with the illegal activ -
ities under consideration are included as prox -
ies. In the literature, a tax rate is usually incorp -
orated into the currency demand model be -
cause the burden of taxation and social contri -
butions is considered to be a key motive for 
production in the shadow economy.36 Other 
variables, such as the rate of unemployment 
and indicators of criminality, can also be in -
cluded in empirical modelling.37 Provided that 
the selected indicators explain parts of the cur -
rency demand, this ultimately points to an il -
legal use of cash.
Studies for Germany based on the currency de -
mand approach do, in fact, find that measures 
for the tax burden have a statistically significant influence on the demand for cash.38 This is one 
indication that the shadow economy has an 
impact on currency demand in Germany. One 
application quantifies the extent of the shadow 
economy in Germany at 15% of GDP (see the 
table on p. 47). One criticism levelled at the 
currency demand approach is that the derived 
results are crucially dependent on key assump -
tions.39 Specifically, the legal function of cash Econometric

Panel analysis of cash lodgements at Bundesbank branches
The motives behind cash use in Germany 
are investigated by analysing lodgements 
made at Bundesbank branches. In simplifi  ed 
terms, the central bank issues banknotes to 
the commercial banks which, in turn, pay 
them out to their customers. Consumers 
use the banknotes to make purchases from 
retailers, who then deposit the cash at the 
central bank, either directly or via the com-
mercial banks.1 On balance, while bank-
notes are also put back into circulation by 
commercial banks after undergoing checks 
for authenticity and fi  tness, it is the Bundes-
bank which carries out the lion’s share of 
automated banknote processing in Ger-
many. Cash deposits at the Bundesbank’s 
branches thus provide a coherent picture of 
cash usage in Germany. Here, we examine 
whether these inpayments are, in part, at-
tributable to the shadow economy. Cash is 
paid in at the Bundesbank by retailers and 
banks and therefore stems from legal trans-
actions, in principle. However, it is possible 
that cash deposits could be indirectly linked 
to income from the shadow economy with-
out the Bundesbank being able to tell 
whether a specifi  c lodgement involves cash 
that has previously been used in a shadow 
economy transaction.
It is assumed that real cash deposits per in-
habitant in region i  at time t , Inpit , result 
from economic output, GDPit(1+x /prime
itβ), 
weighted with a share of cash payments ηit. 
This economic output is made up of the real 
gross domestic product (GDP) per inhabit-
ant, GDPit , plus the shadow economy. To 
approximate the size of the shadow econ-
omy we factor in variables xit , for which a 
relationship with the size of the shadow 
economy can be assumed. The scale of the 
shadow economy in relation to the meas-
ured economic output GDPit is denoted by x /prime
itβ, where β is a coeffi   cient vector. The 
equation below illustrates the relationship 
being described.
Inp it=⌘itGDP it(1 + x0
itβ),
i=1, ..., N, t =1, ..., T
By making use of the approximations ηit ≈ 
eαieλt and log(1+x /prime
itβ) ≈ x /prime
itβ, after taking 
logarithms and the addition of an error 
term uit , the estimating equation shown 
below is obtained.
log(Inp it)=↵i+λt+log(GDP it)+x0
itβ
+uit,i=1, ..., N, t =1, ..., T
This equation represents a static panel re-
gression with fi  xed effects for regions ( αi) 
and time periods ( λt). Panel data for cash 
deposits broken down by region for the 
years 1993 to 2015 are used for the empir-
ical investigation. The least squares method 
is applied to determine the model param-
eters.2
Several variables are taken into account as 
indicators for the shadow economy xit so as 
to yield as complete a picture as possible of

the Bundesbank’s role is limited to that of a whole-

the infl  uence of the shadow economy on 
cash lodgements. The burden of taxation 
and social security contributions is regarded 
as an important motive for shifting eco-
nomic activities to the shadow economy. 
The tax and social contributions ratio is 
therefore a possible indicator for illegal uses 
of cash.3 Other indicators include the un-
employment rate, the self- employment rate 
and the proportions of people employed in 
the agricultural sector and the construction 
sector.4 We also want to cover areas of the 
shadow economy where the manufacture 
or trading of the produced goods is illegal. 
To this end, we investigate the infl  uence of 
indicators of regional crime levels taken 
from the police crime statistics.5 The vari-
ables considered are the total number of 
criminal offences per 1,000 inhabitants, the 
number of crimes involving brutality and of-
fences against personal freedom per 1,000 
inhabitants,6 the number of offences involv-
ing theft per 1,000 inhabitants and the number of drug- related offences per 1,000 
inhabitants. The adjacent table shows se-
lected results from the panel econometric 
analyses. Only the results for the indicators 
of illegal cash use that exhibit a statistically 
signifi  cant impact with the expected sign 
are included.
A common approach in the literature is to 
ascertain the quantitative extent of illegal 
cash usage using a model simulation on the 
basis of the estimated model equations.7 
The value for the dependent variable pro-
jected by the model is usually calculated 
fi  rst. This calculation is then repeated under 
the assumption that the shadow economy 
indicators take a certain reference value in 
order to work out what the value of the de-
pendent variable would be without the 
shadow economy. The difference between 
these values gives an estimate for the de-
gree to which the dependent variable under 
consideration (for example, cash in circula-
tion or cash lodgements) is attributable to

as a store of value as well as foreign demand 
should also be captured in the currency de -
mand approach. When interpreting the results, 
due account should also be taken of the fact 
that the currency demand approach can only 
investigate the illegal uses of cash that are suf -
ficiently large in scale to be relevant to a na -
tional economy and for which suitable indica -
tor variables are available.
The significance of illegal motives for the use of 
cash in Germany is the subject of two new 
studies based on the currency demand ap -
proach. A panel econometric analysis looks at 
the impact of the illegal use of cash on cash 
lodgements at branches of the Bundesbank. 
Using a time series econometric regression an -
alysis, the significance of illegal motives for the 
domestic demand for banknotes is investi -
gated. Of the nine indicators of illegal cash use 
considered in the panel econometric analysis 
(see the box on pp. 53 ff.), only the coefficients 
of the self- employment rate and the number of drug- related offences are statistically signifi -
cantly different from zero with the expected 
sign.40 Given a 1 percentage point rise in the 
self- employment rate or one additional drug-  
related offence per 1,000 inhabitants, cash 
lodgements would, depending on the specifi -
cation, go up by 4% to 5% and thus also on 
an economically significant scale. The box on 
pp. 53 ff. discusses the extent to which quanti -
tative estimates of the volume of cash lodge -
ments stemming indirectly from the shadow 
economy are reliably possible and what results 
are achieved by doing this.
In addition, the use of cash in the shadow 
economy is estimated using regression analyses Two new stud -
ies on the 
significance  of 
illegal motives 
for cash 
demandthe shadow economy. The calculated values 
for the extent of illegal cash use may de-
pend heavily on the assumptions made and 
should be interpreted with caution accord-
ingly. For instance, setting a reference value 
for the shadow economy indicators when 
there is assumed to be no shadow econ-
omy is an arbitrary exercise to a certain ex-
tent. Despite these limitations, in the inter-
ests of transparent documentation of the 
possible model implications, the table on 
p. 54 shows the results of a model simula-
tion following the pattern detailed above 
for the average share of cash deposits that 
can be indirectly attributed to the shadow 
economy.8 On balance, averaged across the 
regions and time periods included in the 
study, around 14% of lodgements can be 
indirectly ascribed to the shadow economy. 
After conversion, we end up with deposits 
of illegal cash totalling around €60 billion 
for the year 2015. Conceptually speaking, it is not possible to determine the size of the 
shadow economy on the basis of this value. 
One reason for this is that we do not know 
how frequently cash is used for transactions 
within the shadow economy before it 
makes its way into the formal economy. 
This estimate for the volume of illegal cash 
lodgements would be consistent with high 
estimates for the size of the shadow econ-
omy if cash takings in the shadow economy 
were primarily and repeatedly reused for 
payments in the shadow economy before 
being deposited at the Bundesbank via re-
tailers or credit institutions.
8 The calculation is based on a method used in the 
economic literature; see V. Tanzi (1983), op. cit. The 
reference value for the shadow economy indicators for 
which there are only legal cash lodgements is set at 
zero.
40 The statistical significance of a regression coefficient 
means that sample data deviate so strongly from the as -
sumption that the coefficient is equal to zero (null hypoth -
esis) that this hypothesis is rejected in accordance with a 
predefined rule (significance test). The significance test, 
however, does not provide any information on the strength 
of the effect, i.e. the economic significance of the regres -
sion coefficient.Deutsche Bundesbank

Estimating the domestic demand for banknotes
The contribution of various determinants to 
the domestic demand for banknotes can be 
captured in econometric models. For this 
purpose, the Bundesbank has estimated 
dynamic  regression models; more specifi  c-
ally, autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) 
models.1 The estimates are made using a 
real specifi  cation and with seasonally ad-
justed data covering the period from the 
fi  rst quarter of 2002 to the fourth quarter 
of 2015 (and, for some variables, to the 
second quarter of 2016). The price- adjusted 
domestic demand for banknotes to be ex-
plained is the real difference between total 
cumulative net issuance of banknotes by 
the Bundesbank and estimated foreign de-
mand.2 This analysis focuses on the shadow 
economy as an explanatory variable for 
banknote demand. An increase in shadow 
economy activities should result in a higher 
demand for cash. The phenomenon of the 
shadow economy has a variety of manifest-
ations that can be modelled using the fol-
lowing proxy variables: tax and social con-
tributions ratio, employment rate in the 
agricultural sector, employment rate in the 
construction sector, unemployment rate, 
self- employment rate, drug- related crimes, 
and crimes in total. These variables repre-
sent various aspects of the shadow econ-
omy. The fi  rst fi  ve of these proxy variables 
can be assigned to legal production and are 
designated here as the “shadow economy 
– legal production” group. The last two 
proxy variables represent illegal activities 
and form the “shadow economy – illegal” 
group. To avoid the problem of omitted 
variables, two proxy variables for the shadow 
economy were included as regressors in the 
starting specifi  cation of the estimated 
models; one from the “shadow economy 
– legal production” group and one from the 
“shadow economy – illegal” group.3The traditional determinants of the demand 
for cash are modelled by cash consumption 
as a transaction variable and interest rate as 
an opportunity cost variable. Cash con-
sumption refers to those categories of pri-
vate consumption that are largely settled in 
cash.4 The entire interest rate range is in-
corporated into the analysis by including a 
shift parameter from an estimated yield 
curve to represent the generally prevailing 
interest rate level. Domestic card turnover is 
used as a control variable for the substitu-
tion of cash with cashless payment instru-
ments. The impact of card payments on the 
demand for banknotes is theoretically un-
certain. Girocards and credit cards are a 
substitute for cash payments, although they 
are also used to withdraw cash from ATMs. 
The impact on demand is twofold: on the 
one hand, lower transaction costs for with-
drawing cash reduce the demand for cash. 
On the other hand, however, they also 
make it easier to access cash, thus boosting 
demand.

3 Due to the relatively low number of observations, it 
was decided not to include all seven proxy variables for 
the shadow economy in the regression equation at the 
same time.
4 These include spending on accommodation and hos-
pitality services, clothing and footwear, leisure, enter-
tainment and culture, food, beverages and tobacco as 
well as on other purposes, such as healthcare.Deutsche Bundesbank

where yt stands for the domestic demand 
for banknotes as an endogenous variable, c 
is the constant term, xt designates the vec-
tor of the control variables, zprod,t represents 
a shadow economy variable from the 
“shadow economy – legal production” group, 
zillegal,t represents a shadow economy vari-
able from the “shadow economy – illegal” 
group, and ut is the residual. The alphas, 
betas and gammas are the corresponding 
coeffi   cients. The fi  nal specifi  cation of this 
model was determined using a general-  
to-specifi  c approach. The most meaningful 
model in economic terms was selected 
from the resulting models. This is shown in 
the adjacent table. With the exception of 
the tax and social contributions ratio, which 
is already stationary according to statistical 
tests, all variables are transformed into sta-
tionary variables before being fed into the 
analysis. The fi  rst difference of the interest 
rate is used for this variable. The remaining 
variables are transformed using their fi  rst 
logarithmic difference. The test statistics do 
not point to a misspecifi  cation of the re-
gression model. The dynamic regression 
model explains domestic demand using its 
lagged values, cash consumption in the 
previous period, the interest rate, card turn-
over lagged by one period as well as the tax 
and social contributions ratio as a proxy 
variable for the shadow economy. Further-
more, a dummy variable depicts the in-
crease in the demand for banknotes in the 
wake of the 2008 fi  nancial crisis.5 All esti-
mated coeffi   cients have the theoretically 
expected signs and are statistically signifi  -
cant; for card turnover, the negative effects 
on domestic demand predominate. To in-
terpret the results, it is essential to identify 
the long- term effects on domestic demand 
caused by permanent changes in the ex-
planatory variables. In order to extract these 
long- term multipliers, the dynamic regres-
sion model in reduced form is transposed 
into the static long- run equation.The long- term multiplier for the tax and so-
cial contributions ratio suggests that an in-
crease of 1 percentage point in this ratio 
pushes up the growth rate of domestic de-
mand by 2.2 percentage points.

of the (real) domestic demand for banknotes 
(see the box on pp. 56 f.). Accordingly, of the 
seven shadow economy proxy variables used, 
only the tax and social contributions ratio has a 
statistically significant (positive) impact on the 
domestic demand for banknotes.41 If there is a 
sustained 1  percentage point increase in the 
tax and social contributions ratio, the growth 
rate of the domestic demand for banknotes 
goes up by 2.2 percentage points over the long 
term. This long- term multiplier is also econom -
ically significant. The quantitative contributions 
of the various determinants can be compared 
by decomposing the growth in the domestic 
demand for banknotes (see the chart on p. 52).42 
Developments in the growth rate of the do -
mestic demand for banknotes can be split into 
three phases. It was positive from the launch of 
euro cash until the end of 2006, then negative 
until the end of 2011, and has been positive 
again since then with a tendency to rise. Since 
2012, the tax and social contributions ratio has 
made the largest contribution to growth in do -
mestic demand, followed by the growth rates 
in cash consumption and card payments. This 
finding highlights the economic significance of 
the tax and social contributions ratio in the do -
mestic demand for banknotes.
Conclusions
Cash payments are made without any technical 
devices by simply handing over banknotes and 
coins. As a result, cash transactions can be 
completed without third parties obtaining 
knowledge of the parties involved. By using 
cash in their daily lives, members of the general 
public can maintain their personal privacy. 
However, the anonymity of cash can be ab -
used, for instance, in connection with tax eva -
sion or trading in illegal goods.
This possible role of cash in the shadow econ -
omy, or as a means of funding crime, has been under increased discussion for some time now. 
However, estimating the actual scale on which 
cash is being used for illegal purposes repre -
sents a challenge. Direct estimates – such as 
those that use the volume of cash in circulation 
or the demand for large- denomination bank -
notes to conclude that there is, supposedly, an 
extensive illegal use of cash  – seem scarcely 
appro priate, as they do not take account of 
the legal function of cash as a store of value. 
Econometric estimates of the cash demand 
present a mixed picture overall of the signifi -
cance of the shadow economy for the demand 
for cash in Germany. According to the Bundes -
bank’s own empirical studies of the deter -
minants of cash lodgements at Bundesbank 
branches as well as of the Bundesbank’s cumu -
lative net issuance of euro banknotes, no more 
than a few of the potential indicators of illegal 
cash use are significant in each case. These are, 
first, the self- employment rate and the number 
of drug- related offences, and, second, the tax 
and social contributions ratio. Generally, stud -
ies of the shadow economy refer to an unob -
servable variable, which means that the results 
can potentially depend to a large degree on 
the assumptions made and should be inter -
preted only with caution.
Finally, there remains the question of how far 
the shadow economy can be contained by re -
stricting the use of cash. In this regard, there is 
still a lack of empirical evidence as to whether 
measures such as abolishing large- denomination 
banknotes or introducing upper limits for cash 
payments would, in fact, be an effective means 
of combating tax evasion and other criminal 
activities.43Statistical

41 The terms “domestic banknote circulation” and “do -
mestic demand for banknotes” have the same meaning, as 
banknote circulation is determined solely by the demand 
for banknotes.
42 This decomposition of growth is based on the static 
long- run equation for the domestic demand for banknotes.
