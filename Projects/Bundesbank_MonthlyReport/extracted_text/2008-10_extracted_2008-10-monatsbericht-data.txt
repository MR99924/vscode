Industry
Industrial output in July and August con-
tinued at the subdued pace of the second
quarter. If positive special factors in the first
quarter and various holiday-related irregular-
ities in the ensuing period are taken into ac-
count, the purely cyclical losses were, if any-
thing, moderate in the period under review.
In August, seasonally adjusted industrial out-
put was 3.2% up on the month, in fact.
However, this quite sharp increase mainly
reflects the fact that the public holidays were
relatively heavily concentrated on the month
of July. While this resulted in a weak output
figure for July, production in August benefit-
ed from the way in which the holidays fell. If
the two months are taken together – which is
more informative – industrial output declined
by 0.5% on the quarter, which was merely
the extent of the upward revision of activity
for the reference period. Output in July and
August was 1.2% up on the year overall.
In line with output, industrial sales, on an
average of the period from July to August,
were 0.4% down on the second quarter.
While domestic sales remained virtually un-
changed, exports showed a marked decline.
The fact that the decline in exports of goods
in July was followed by a further seasonally
adjusted fall in August is consistent with this
picture. Price corrections in the international
commodity markets, too, meant that nominal
imports of goods in the reporting period
failed by a wide margin to match the very
high level of the previous month. In August,Output

6the trade surplus, in which there was a mas-
sive reduction in July, showed an improve-
ment to a seasonally adjusted 313 billion. Ad-
justed for movements in prices, foreign trade
is likely to have been a dampening factor for
economic activity in the third quarter.
The intake of orders in August, at a seasonally
adjusted +3.6%, picked up sharply in com-
parison with July. This growth was sustained
equally by increased domestic and foreign
demand. Especially with regard to domestic
orders, the effects of the public holidays are
likely to have been a significant factor. On an
average of the months of July and August,
the volume of orders, at 1.6%, was, never-
theless, quite clearly down on the second
quarter. While there was no more than a
moderate decline in the volume of orders
received by intermediate goods producers,
orders of capital goods and consumer goods
showed a marked fall. The largest decline
was in orders for motor vehicles, trailers and
semi-trailers. The volume of orders for ma-
chinery and equipment was even somewhat
larger than in the second quarter. Overall,
orders received in July and August were 2.5%
down on the year in calendar-adjusted terms.
Construction
Construction output was quite weak overall
in July and August. Seasonally adjusted con-
struction output did increase by 5.5% in
August, but had declined quite markedly in
the two preceding months. Output in the
reporting period may have benefited from
the fact that the volume of orders had picked
up exceptionally strongly (+7.0%) in JulyEconomic conditions in Germany*

This increase was due mainly to new roadconstruction projects and followed a periodof very slow ordering in the second quarter.In addition, demand for housing constructionhas recovered somewhat since the secondquarter.
Economy as a wholeGiven the marked slowdown in the pace of
global economic growth and generally great-er uncertainty in the wake of the heightenedcrisis in the international financial markets,the German economy is likely to have largelystood still in seasonally adjusted terms in thethird quarter. This was due mainly to the factthat the dampening effects stemming fromforeign trade became stronger in the periodunder review, while the surge in costs due toenergy prices in the second quarter was stillimpacting on demand in the third quarter.The very sharp adjustment in prices in theinternational oil markets after the middle ofthe year as well as the ongoing growth inemployment are likely to have stabilisedprivate consumption, however. Furthermore,investment probably showed an overall in-crease in the third quarter. The building-up ofinventories played the most important part inthis as the cost of inputs went down again.Firms’ spending on new plant and equipmentis likely to have held up at least at a highlevel. By contrast, construction investment islikely to have been weak as in the secondquarter. Given a trend stabilisation in domes-tic demand and a greater propensity to stockup with raw materials that are no longer soexpensive, imports showed a sharp increase
in the third quarter.
Labour marketAccording to initial estimates by the Federal
Statistical Office, the number of persons inwork in August went up by 39,000 to 40.36million. Virtually the entire increase was ac-counted for latterly by jobs which are subjectto social security contributions. The overalllevel of employment was 545,000, or 1.4%,higher than in the same period of 2007.There was hardly any change in the numberof job vacancies reported to the FederalEmployment Agency. According to the Ifoemployment barometer, trade and industryare, nevertheless, likely to have becomemuch more cautious in their personnelplanning.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment fell by
29.000 to 3.18 million in September. Thisgives an overall fall in unemployment of463,000 on the year. Just under 40% of thedecline was in job seekers receiving unem-ployment benefits under the statutory insur-ance scheme and just over 60% were jobseekers receiving the basic welfare allowance.The unemployment rate was a seasonallyadjusted 7.6% in September, compared with7.7% in August and 8.3% at the end of lastyear.

8ber. For a time, suggestions that the OPEC
decision to cut back production was going to
be implemented as well as production losses
in the Gulf of Mexico as a result of the hurri-
canes ”Gustav” and ”Ike” led to a marked
upward movement with decidedly high vola-
tility. On a monthly average, the spot price for
Brent North Sea oil, at more than US$101,
was almost US$15 below the the figure for
August. As this report went to press, the spot
price stood at US$67, which was less than
half as much as when the price peaked in
July. In the oil futures markets, six-month
deliveries now cost US$63/C254more; the mark-
up for 18-month deliveries is, in fact, more
than US$14.
Owing to the falling crude oil prices, imports
in August were a seasonally adjusted 1.4%
cheaper on average than in the previous
month. The year-on-year figure was un-
changed at +9.3%. If energy is excluded,
import prices showed a further rise and the
12-month figure went up from 1.4% to
1.8%. Domestic producer prices also went
down because of energy prices. They were up
8.1% on the year at the end of the period
under review; excluding energy, the increase
was 3.4%.
Following a temporary decline in August,
consumer prices went up again in September
by a seasonally adjusted 0.3%. Heating oil
was, in fact, somewhat cheaper and fuel
prices remained largely stable, although there
were sharp increases in some cases for gas.
There was a further relatively sharp rise in the
cost of industrial goods, while the price
trends for services and housing rents con-tinued to be moderate. The change in food
prices was only slight. The annual rate of
change in the national consumer price index
(CPI) fell from 3.1% in August to 2.9% in
September. According to the Harmonised
Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the year-on-
year rate at the end of the reporting period
was 3.0%, compared with 3.3% in August.
Public finances1
Local government finances
The most recent cash statistics data from the
Federal Statistical Office show that local gov-
ernment recorded a large overall surplus of
33 billion in the second quarter of 2008, as it
had done one year previously. However, the
Federal Statistical Office points out that the
results could be distorted as the use of com-
mercial bookkeeping, which is becoming
more widespread within local government, is
associated with data recording problems.2It
said that this also impairs the informative
value of year-on-year comparisons.
According to the available data, local govern-
ment revenue increased sharply again by al-
most 6% ( 321/C252billion). This was mainly due
to the favourable development of tax receipts
(+71/C252%o r 311/C254billion), which was driven by

9rapid growth in inflows from income tax
shares (+161/C252%o r 33/C254billion). But local busi-
ness tax revenue also continued to increase– albeit at a somewhat slower pace – withthe shortfalls expected as a result of the busi-ness tax reform probably having had only alimited impact on cash receipts up to the endof the reporting period. After deducting theshare of local business tax revenue accruingto state and central government, which wasreduced further in 2008, the high prior-yearfigure was further exceeded by just over4
1/C252%(31/C252billion). In addition, revenue from
categories of grants from state governmentwhich are largely linked to the level of tax rev-enue also increased (+10% or 3
1/C252billion). By
contrast, receipts from fees and capital pro-ceeds, which alongside investment grantsfrom state government consist above all ofproceeds from asset realisations, remainedlargely unchanged on the year.
Following the slight year-on-year decline in
total expenditure that was recorded at thebeginning of 2008, spending shot up by6
1/C252%(321/C252billion) in the second quarter. The
steep rise in personnel expenditure of 71/C252%
(or33/C254billion) was primarily due to the rela-
tively high pay settlement concluded inspring, which entailed corresponding back-payments for the months since the start of2008. Other operating expenditure jumpedby as much as 9
1/C252% (or 33/C254billion). However,
as in the case of other categories of expend-iture, this figure may exaggerate the actualexpenditure development somewhat owingto retrospective postings from the first quar-ter. Despite the marked decrease in accom-modation costs for long-term unemployedpersons, the cost of social benefits also re-
corded an increase. However, at just over2%, this was below average. Finally, the vol-ume of expenditure on fixed assets grew byjust over 9
1/C252% (just under 31/C252billion). Along-
side higher prices, this reflected, as expected,the overall favourable local government fi-nancial situation.
Despite the revenue shortfalls expected as a
result of the business tax reform and the im-pact of the negotiated pay rises on personnelexpenditure, local government is again likelyto record a relatively high surplus on balancein 2008. At + 33 billion in mid-2008, the bal-
ance was 32 billion higher still than the com-
parable figure in 2007, which posted a full-year record surplus of 38
1/C252billion. However,

10sible increase in tax shortfalls in the second
half of 2008 owing to fiscal reforms mean
that it is unlikely that this favourable develop-
ment will continue. Against this background,
the developments in local government bor-
rowing give cause for concern. Although sur-
pluses in the second quarter of 2008 were re-
ported for local government in all the federal
states, municipal credit market debt at the
end of the second quarter ( 3821/C252billion
gross) remained at the level recorded at the
end of the first three months. The volume of
cash advances – which are actually only in-
tended to bridge temporary liquidity short-
ages, but are in fact used to finance current
expenditure – rose again by 31/C252billion to
329 billion. It therefore seems imperative that
those local governments affected pursue a
particularly cautious expenditure policy.
Otherwise, any slackening of tax revenue de-
velopments will make it even harder to return
to a sound fiscal position, which is necessary
for sustainable development.
When publishing its cash statistics data, the
Federal Statistical Office once again highlight-
ed data quality problems which are apparent-
ly connected to deriving the data from the ac-
counting records of those local governments
that have changed over to the double-entry
bookkeeping system. However, high-quality
German public finance statistics are indis-
pensable, not least as a basis for sustainable
budgetary management and in the context of
the European budgetary surveillance proced-
ure. Alongside local governments subject to
reporting requirements, state parliaments
also have an important responsibility in this
respect. The autumn 2003 Interior Ministers’Conference on reforming local government
budgetary rules addressed the need to meet
the statistical reporting requirements and
adopted corresponding agreements on new
account systems. Reliable and comparable
data on local government finances are indis-
pensable.
Securities markets
Bond market
In August 2008, the issue volume in the Ger-
man bond market was down on the previous
month with gross sales amounting to 3135.9
billion (July: 3147.2 billion). In the light of re-
duced redemptions and after taking account
of changes in issuers’ holdings of their own
bonds and notes, net sales came to 345.5 bil-
lion, compared with 311.3 billion in the pre-
ceding month. The outstanding amount of
foreign debt securities in the German market
decreased by 32.3 billion in the reporting
month; on balance, the decrease affected
euro-denominated securities only.
Among borrowers, the public sector tapped
the capital markets for 313.0 billion in Au-
gust. Central government issued 311.0 billion
worth of debt securities; these were primarily
ten-year Federal bonds (Bunds) for 39.0 bil-
lion, Bubills for 31.8 billion and two-year Fed-
eral Treasury notes (Sch/C228tze) for 30.6 billion.
At the same time it redeemed 30-year Bunds,
Federal savings notes, Federal Treasury finan-

governments increased by 32.0 billion net.
German credit institutions’ net borrowing
reached 34.3 billion in the reporting month.
They did this by issuing other credit institutionbonds ( 33.2 billion) and mortgage Pfand-
briefe ( 32.5 billion) while specialised credit
institutions issued debt securities worth31.3 billion. By contrast, the volume of
public Pfandbriefe outstanding declined by32.6 billion.
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises
tapped the bond market for 328.1 billion in
net terms. A large securitisation operationwas one notable factor.
Domestic credit institutions formed the most
significant group of purchasers in the Germanbond market ( 327.2 billion). They concen-
trated solely on domestic instruments. For-eign investors also significantly increasedtheir German bond portfolios ( 321.6 billion).
By contrast, German non-banks sold debtsecurities totalling 35.6 billion.
Equity marketIn the month under review, domestic enter-
prises issued 30.4 billion worth of new shares
in the German equity market, almost all ofwhich involved listed companies. Sales of for-eign equities on the German market weresomewhat higher ( 31.3 billion). As regards
the purchasers, it was primarily German non-banks who were active ( 38.2 billion). By con-
trast, German credit institutions were pre-dominantly sellers ( 30.8 billion). Foreign in-vestors also sold German equities totalling
35.6 billion net.
Mutual fund sharesIn August, domestic mutual funds recorded
inflows of 31.9 billion net. As had already
been the case in the previous month, onlyspecialised funds reserved for institutional in-vestors were able to sell certificates ( 32.5 bil-
lion) while domestic mutual funds open tothe general public paid back 30.6 billion out
of their managed funds to investors. Theseoutflows affected bond-based funds in par-ticular ( 30.9 billion) as well as, to a lesser ex-
tent, money market and share-based funds(each 30.3 billion). By contrast, open-end real
estate funds ( 30.5 billion), mixed securities-

funds also recorded inflows from German in-
vestors ( 31.1 billion). In August, mutual fund
shares were purchased predominantly by Ger-
man non-banks ( 32.6 billion) as well as by
German credit institutions ( 30.7 billion). By
contrast, non-residents sold 30.3 billion net
worth of share certificates.
Balance of payments
In August, the surplus on Germany’s current
account – in unadjusted terms – fell to 37.3
billion and was thus 34.6 billion down on the
month. This result can be attributed to a
reduced trade surplus and a larger deficit on
invisible current transactions, which comprise
services, income and current transfers.
According to provisional figures from the
Federal Statistical Office, the foreign trade
surplus in August went down by 33.2 billion
on the month to 310.6 billion. After adjust-
ment for seasonal and calendar variations, it
increased by 31.5 billion to 313.1 billion. The
value of exports declined by 0.5% while the
value of imports fell by 2.5%. Based on a
July-August average, seasonally adjusted
nominal exports were down by 0.5% com-
pared with the average recorded for the
second quarter. Imports rose by 6.1%; more
than one-quarter of this increase was caused
by higher prices, especially for energy and
other commodities.
The deficit on invisible current transactions
grew from 31.0 billion in July to 32.4 billion
in August. The main reason for this was theMajor items of the balance

1331.5 billion rise in the deficit on services to
34.0 billion, which was largely holiday-
related. By contrast, the income balancesurplus widened slightly by 30.1 billion to
34.2 billion. At 32.6 billion, net expenditure
on current transfers remained unchanged onthe month.
As in the preceding three months, there were
again net capital imports resulting from cross-border portfolio investment in August(316.0 billion). Following a temporary lull,
foreign portfolio investors once againstrengthened their investment in Germany(315.6 billion compared with 37.7 billion in
July). They invested primarily in debt securities(321.6 billion) concentrating mainly on public
bonds and money market paper. By contrast,they again disposed of shares ( 35.6 billion
compared with 34.4 billion in the previous
month). Securities transactions by Germaninvestors almost cancelled each other out inAugust ( 30.4 billion). Residents sold foreign
debt securities ( 32.3 billion) and purchased
modest amounts of mutual fund shares(31.1billion) and shares ( 30.8 billion).
Direct investment resulted in net capital ex-
ports of 31.0 billion in August, which was
down on the month ( 310.2 billion). This de-
cline was attributable largely to the fact thatforeign enterprises re-equipped their Germanaffiliates with capital ( 32.0 billion) after with-
drawing funds from them in the previousmonth ( 37.0 billion). German enterpriseslikewise provided their foreign affiliates with
additional capital ( 33.0 billion). This was
achieved by reinvesting earnings and boost-ing equity capital (combined total 35.2 bil-
lion). At the same time, as a result of creditrelationships with their foreign affiliates, theyacquired inflows of funds amounting to32.2 billion.
Other statistically recorded investment com-
prising financial and trade credits (in as muchas these do not constitute a part of directinvestment) as well as bank deposits andother assets saw net capital exports of316.3 billion in August. Non-banks account-
ed for 34.4 billion of these outflows. Here, a
major role was played by the activities of gen-eral government ( 37.0 billion), which re-
deemed short-term financial credits outsideGermany and increased its bank depositsabroad. By contrast, enterprises and house-holds recorded inflows of 32.6 billion. The
banking system registered net capital exportsof312.0 billion. These resulted from the in-
crease in the Bundesbank’s claims againstnon-residents ( 312.5 billion), which in large
part was generated by the TARGET2 largevalue payment system. Conversely, credit in-stitutions experienced modest inflows offunds ( 30.5 billion).
The Bundesbank’s reserve assets – at transac-
tion values – remained broadly unchanged inAugust.

15Germany’s international
investment position
since the beginning
of monetary union:
developments and
structureGermany’s financial ties with the rest
of the world have strengthened signifi-
cantly in recent years. At the end of
2007, Germany’s external assets to-
talled 55,004 billion, its liabilities
54,360 billion. Both positions have
more than doubled since the begin-
ning of monetary union. This increase
reflects the global trend towards diver-
sifying assets across borders. It also re-
lates to the introduction of the euro
which created a large financial playing
field in which exchange rate risks no
longer play a role.
Overall, Germany had net external
assets of 5645 billion at the end of
2007. This represented 261/C252% of GDP.
This amount was essentially an accu-
mulation of current account surpluses
since 2001. Given the likely impact of
demographic ageing, it can also be
considered a nest egg for future finan-
cial requirements.
The following article analyses key de-
velopments in Germany’s international
investment position since the begin-
ning of monetary union. It also exam-
ines the effects of the introduction of
the euro on the main regional invest-
ment targets. The underlying method-
ology used to establish the inter-
national investment position is de-
scribed in the annex.

16Developmental overview of Germany’s
international investment position
Germany’s financial relationships with other
countries are shown in relative detail in the
international investment position (IIP). It pro-
vides information on the scope and structure
of international assets and liabilities in do-
mestic sectors in Germany. The IIP shows the
international financial operations of residents,
as recorded in the balance of payments, as
well as the market price changes in assets be-
tween the relevant balance sheet dates.
Exchange-rate-related changes are factored
into foreign currency positions. In addition to
the balance of payments, the IIP is therefore
another important source of information for
analysing Germany’s relationships with third
countries.The annual figures for 2007 show that Germa-
ny’s international financial relationships have
again intensified. At the end of 2007, Germa-
ny’s external assets amounted to 35,004 billion,
two and a half times more than at the begin-
ning of monetary union. Compared with the
beginning of 1991, they were as much as six
times higher. While, at an annual average of
101/C252%, the volume of external assets grew at
roughly the same rate as total German financial
assets (+91/C252%) in the years prior to monetary
union (1991 to 1998), the external assets in-
cluded in the IIP grew at an even faster rate
from 1999 to 2007 (annual average of 111/C252%),
overtaking total German assets by a consider-
able margin (annual average of around 41/C252%).
T h eh o m eb i a so fG e r m a ni n v e s t o r sh a se v i -
dently continued to abate in recent years; port-
folios have therefore assumed a more inter-
national flavour, in which – as explained later –
other euro-area countries account for the lion’s
share of investments. This development suf-
fered a temporary setback as a result of height-
ened uncertainty on the global financial mar-
kets following the bursting of the new econ-
omy bubble, the attacks of 11 September 2001
and the economic downturn in the world econ-
omy. These events led to a slight drop in Ger-
many’s external assets in 2002. The brisk in-
crease then resumed, however, thanks mainly
to high current account surpluses in Germany.
At the end of 2007, external liabilities totalled
34,360 billion, almost two and a half times
more than at the beginning of monetary
union. External liabilities have increased at a
relatively continuous rate over the entire
period despite a slightly slower pace of
growth at the beginning of this decadeYear-end levels

17owing to the above-mentioned events. Heavy
external demand for German securitiesplayed a key role in increasing external liabil-ities. In recent years, however, external liabil-ities have grown considerably more slowlythan assets as current account surpluses tend-ed to favour the creation of external assets.
Germany’s net external position thus reached
a record high of 3645 billion at the end of
2007. At the beginning of monetary union,Germany’s net external position was just 334
billion. The increase is attributable largely tothe current account surpluses of 3569 billion
generated since 1999. To a certain extent,these contain a self-perpetuating element asthey are linked to the accumulation of yield-bearing assets, and the resulting capitalgains, in turn, have a positive effect on thecurrent account.
Revaluations following changes in exchange
rates and stock market prices also played amajor role in the development of the netinternational investment position. These af-fected foreign currency items and market-price-related assets. In the nine years sincethe beginning of monetary union, exchangerate changes have had a negative effect onthe international investment position overall(3144 billion). Owing to the trend appreci-
ation of the euro, this reflects the accumu-lated losses relating to positions denominatedin foreign currency which, because of thehigher proportion of foreign currency on theasset side, have a negative impact on the netinternational investment position. At the endof 2007, 32% of external assets and 16
1/C252%
of external liabilities were denominated inforeign currency; at the beginning of monet-
ary union,1the corresponding percentages
were 46% and 21%.
By contrast, market prices – particularly devel-
opments on the share and bond markets –had a slightly positive effect in the periodunder review, albeit with major fluctuationsin individual years (accumulated effect: 325
billion). Market-price-related haircuts wereapplied only at the beginning of the decadeand in 2007. Last year alone, market pricechanges reduced the net international invest-ment position by 367 billion, in part because,Beginning of 1999 to end of 2007

18in 2007, the share prices of German com-
panies rose significantly more than those of
foreign companies.
The sharp increase in Germany’ s external
assets and liabilities in recent years has taken
place in an international environment charac-
terised largely by advancing financial market
convergence. As a result, the degree of finan-
cial openness – measured as the ratio of total
external assets and liabilities to GDP – rose sig-
nificantly in many countries.2In industrial
countries overall, this ratio has more or less
doubled since the beginning of 1999; it has
therefore grown much faster than the degree
of openness of the real economy. Germany’ s
financial integration into the world economy
took place correspondingly fast during this
period. At the end of 2007, the degree of fi-
nancial openness was almost 400%, twice as
high as at the beginning of monetary union.
Germany’s international investment
position by sector
Monetary financial institutions
The banking sector plays a central role in Ger-
many’s increasing financial integration with
other countries. Almost half of all of Germa-
ny’s external assets and liabilities ( 32,432 bil-
lion and 32,032 billion, respectively) were at-
tributable to credit institutions at the end of
2007. Banks have expanded their foreign
business considerably since the beginning of
monetary union. Financial credits have ac-
counted for a large share of business, includ-
ing loans, loans against borrower’s notes,bank deposits and assets acquired through
assignment. At the end of 2007, they made
up two-thirds of banks’ external assets and
just over half of their external liabilities. The
counterparties are mostly foreign banks
(interbank transactions), not least banks’ own
affiliates abroad.
Monetary financial institutions (MFIs) also
held substantial foreign securities worth 3735
billion at the end of 2007. The majority of
these ( 3685 billion) were in the form of debt
securities. Mutual fund shares and equities,
by contrast, played only a minor role. Banks’
high level of securities investment should be
seen in connection with below-average credit
growth in Germany in the reporting period.
Banks invested large amounts of the funds
available to them in securities, and did so to a
considerable extent abroad – taking advan-
tage of the yield spread and accepting the
associated risks.3

3The extent to which the crisis on the international
financial markets has affected the external assets of
banks – for example, through the granting of additional
cross-border loans or acceptance of assets or refinancing
operations – cannot be explicitly identified in the highly
aggregated IIP figures, especially as some of the distor-
tions occurred only this year, ie after the cut-off date for
the international investment position (31 December
2007). Furthermore, certain financial operations, such as
the use of derivatives as risk collateral or the granting of
standby credit, are not included (directly) in the inter-
national investment position. Instead, the international
investment position shows a country’s external assets and
liabilities by cut-off date according to an internationally
uniform template, regardless of whether certain positions
can be offset at microeconomic level or hedging instru-
ments have been used.Increasing

20On the financing side, third countries have
also become increasingly important for banks
as a result of the increased acquisition of se-
curities. At the end of 2007, foreign investors
held German bank debt securities worth
3854 billion. The percentage of bonds and
money market paper issued by German
banks and held by foreign investors has there-
fore quadrupled since the beginning of 1999.
By comparison, the entire securitised liabilities
of German banks rose only by around half
their value in the same period, growing by
just3516 billion, to 31,660 billion.
Compared with financial credits and secur-
ities, direct investment accounted for only a
relatively small proportion of banks’ external
assets and liabilities ( 396 billion and 356 bil-
lion, respectively). However, this is also due
partly to the fact that, in the case of bank
shareholdings, loans between affiliated com-
panies are not shown under direct invest-
ments but, instead, under financial credits,
and are therefore not included in these fig-
ures. In total, the net external position of
monetary financial institutions amounted to
3400 billion at the end of 2007.
Enterprises and individuals
At3781 billion, the net external assets of en-
terprises and individuals were almost twice
those of banks. This sector therefore consti-
tuted the largest net creditor of third coun-
tries. Overall, enterprises and individuals held
external assets of 32,351 billion and external
liabilities of 31,570 billion at the end of 2007.In terms of this sector’s external assets, which
also include investment funds (excluding
money market funds) and insurance com-
panies, securities accounted for the lion’s
share. At the end of 2007, the corresponding
assets amounted to 31,053 billion, liabilities
to3557 billion. German enterprises and indi-
viduals invested mainly in foreign bonds and
notes ( 3429 billion) and foreign shares ( 3311
billion), although resident institutional invest-
ors played a significant role in both cases. The
role of foreign mutual fund shares, which
have almost quadrupled to 3305 billion since
January 1999, was not insignificant either.
Moreover, individuals showed great demand
for foreign fund products; such products are
issued primarily by foreign affiliates of Ger-
man financial institutions. With regard to the
liabilities of enterprises and individuals, shares
played an important role ( 3457 billion). They
accounted for 80% of this sector’s securitised
paper liabilities. Non-resident investors now
hold a substantial stake in many German
stock companies – almost one-third in terms
of market capitalisation (excluding direct in-
vestment). By contrast, the role of bonds and
notes is insignificant since domestic firms
traditionally raise funds through equity and
loans. Furthermore, many enterprises active
in the capital market have financial subsidiar-
ies abroad which place their bonds in the
international capital market. They are there-
fore not shown as domestic securities liabil-
ities in the international investment position.
Direct investment – the traditional form of
cross-border integration – has soared in
recent years, particularly in the corporate sec-
tor. At the end of 2007, enterprises and indi-... and liabilities

3753 billion compared with 3278 billion at
the beginning of 1999. Foreign proprietors,in turn, invested 3624 billion in Germany
(January 1999: 3208 billion). The main destin-
ations and countries of origin of direct invest-ment are other European Union countriesand the USA. These regions account for morethan four-fifths of all primary direct invest-ment – both German direct investmentabroad and foreign direct investment in Ger-many.
4Direct investment also includes cross-
border loans between affiliated companies asthese are considered a substitute for equitycapital. Direct investment credits to foreignaffiliates on the asset side of the internationalinvestment position amount to 328 billion
and are thus substantially lower than directinvestment credits on the liability side ( 3250
billion). There are two reasons for this. First,credits to foreign affiliates ( 3143 billion) are
offset by substantial loans from foreign affili-ates to their German parent companies ( 3115
billion). Second, the loan financing of affili-ates in Germany by their foreign parent com-panies traditionally accounts for a large per-centage of foreign direct investment in Ger-many. In terms of value, real estate, which isalso classified as direct investment, plays amajor role, particularly in the case of assets.Germans hold real estate abroad wortharound 3138 billion, while foreigners have
real estate worth only 318 billion in Germany.
It should be noted that the volume of real es-tate abroad was subject to considerable valueappreciation which was not experienced tothe same extent by property in Germany.Furthermore, German residents’ holdingsabroad may be overstated as sales abroad to
non-residents may not be fully recorded.
The international financial and trade credits
of enterprises and individuals amounted to3504 billion at the end of 2007. By contrast,
this sector had credit liabilities of 3385 billion
on its accounts. Half of the assets and one-third of the liabilities were attributable toshort-term financial credits at the end of2007. This was nonetheless a slight decline.The same applies to trade credits, which ac-counted for almost one-quarter of cross-border credit positions. At the beginning ofmonetary union, these accounted for about30%. Thus, loans to enterprises and individ-End-2007

Public authorities in Germany are traditionally
net debtors vis-/C224-vis third countries. At the
end of 2007, their net debtor position was
3700 billion. Debts had therefore almost
doubled from their level at the beginning of
1999 ( 3372 billion). This is attributable mainly
to strong international demand for Bunds,
which, owing the high degree of security and
liquidity offered by these instruments, has
again risen sharply in the course of the finan-
cial crisis which began in the summer of
2007. Foreign investors held German govern-
ment bonds totalling 3720 billion at the end
of 2007. In comparison, general govern-
ment’s external assets are relatively insignifi-
cant. They amounted to 342 billion and con-
sisted mainly of participating interests in
international organisations ( 316 billion) and
financial credits (including bank deposits)
(322 billion).
Bundesbank
Assets, by contrast, played a dominant role in
the international investment position of the
Bundesbank. At the end of 2007, external
assets amounted to 3179 billion. They were
partly offset by liabilities of 316 billion, which
consisted mainly of foreign central bank de-
posits. The Bundesbank’s external assets in-
clude currency reserves ( 393 billion) and
other assets ( 387 billion), which also containasset balances arising in connection with the
large-value payment system TARGET.5These
are subject to significant fluctuation on
specific dates and are ultimately of a purely
transitional nature. The volume of currency
reserves has barely changed since the begin-
ning of monetary union as value increases
resulting from revaluations, especially of gold,
have offset decreases relating to exchange
rates and transactions.
Euro area’s influence on financial
integration
The introduction of the euro in 1999 marked
an important watershed for international
players. This applies to both the real econ-
omy, where it stimulated foreign trade, and
the financial sector. Here, the disappearance
of exchange rate risks facilitated cross-border
investment in the euro area. Furthermore, it is
now possible for investors tied to the national
currency to invest abroad to a far greater ex-
tent. Conversely, the financing basis of debt-
ors also expanded as a result of the enlarged
currency area. However, they have since
faced tougher competition for investment
capital. This has, in many instances, led to
investor-friendly issue terms.
The benefits of the introduction of the euro
in terms of cross-border financial transactions
gave rise to the assumption that there would
be greater financial integration between
euro-area countries. From an investor’s per-
spective, however, it should be noted that all

23euro-area countries could also be exposed to
stronger coincident shocks. Although this isnot necessarily a deterrent for more foreigninvestment, it encourages greater risk diversi-fication – particularly in relation to currency –and thus favours investment outside the euroarea.
6In the end, only empirical analyses can
reveal the factors which shaped investmentand financing decisions.
From a German perspective, two findings are
particularly important.
(1) Financial asset and financing activities
have become more international, as de-scribed above. In the period under review, ex-ternal assets and liabilities increased at amuch quicker pace than other comparablefinancial relationships in Germany. The homebias therefore decreased.
(2) The significance of euro-area countries
within Germany’s international investmentposition has grown considerably.
7Other
euro-area countries accounted for onlyaround 39% of Germany’s external assetsand 36
1/C252% of external liabilities at the begin-
ning of monetary union compared with 50%and 51
1/C252%, respectively, at the end of 2007.8
Germany is therefore more financially inte-grated in the euro area than it is in a real eco-nomic sense. By way of comparison, the euroarea accounted for 41
1/C252% of German trade
in 2007 and 37% of cross-border services.This strong proportional shift has not, how-ever, led to a regional regrouping of invest-ments recorded in the IIP . Germany’s assetsand liabilities vis-/C224-vis countries inside andoutside the euro area have increased in abso-
lute terms, albeit at different speeds.
Regional realignment is particularly evident in
portfolio investments, which have already ex-panded at a disproportionate rate owing tothe growing trend towards securitising finan-cial relationships. Around two-thirds of Ger-man securities claims vis-/C224-vis other countriesand more than half of securities liabilities re-lated to euro-area countries at the end of2007. In both instances, debt securitiesplayed the most important role. From the per-spective of German investors, yield consider-ations were the main incentive for taking partin other euro-area countries’ euro issues onceexchange rate risks had disappeared. Theyields on these countries’ government bondshave been consistently higher than those onBunds in recent years.
9As Bunds provide
6The target country of an asset and the denomination
currency are not always fully reconcilable. Particularly in
the case of debt securities, many countries outside the
euro area use the euro as the issue currency.
7The regional classification of the international invest-
ment position always refers to the composition of coun-
try groups, and thus the euro area, as of the relevant re-
porting date. Regional analyses of Germany’s external
assets use, among other things, information from the
IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey, in which
the Bundesbank also takes part. This allows a reliable
regional classification of securities liabilities, even when
the original purchaser and actual holder are residents of
different countries (see explanations on pp 26-27).
8Data for the beginning of monetary union date from
the end of June 1999. No complete international invest-
ment position vis-/C224-vis euro-area countries is available as
of 1 January 1999.
9Relationships with other euro-area countries in the field
of securities were also chiefly influenced by develop-
ments in mutual fund shares. German investors (including
MFIs) increased their stocks of foreign mutual fund shares
by3247 billion to 3331 billion between 1999 and 2007
(3319 billion of which was attributable to the euro area).
Affiliates of German financial institutions based in Luxem-
bourg provided a large percentage of the underlying mu-
tual funds. Part of the fund assets may have flowed back
into the German securities markets. This theory is sup-
ported by the large share of German securities liabilities
held by Luxembourg.Realignment of

24Evolution of home bias in portfolio investment
The regional diversification of the securities
portfolio held by residents is a widely used
measure of a country’s financial integration
into the world economy. If there are no trans-
action costs and market participants are per-
fectly informed, the international version of
the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) put
forward by Solnik (1974) assumes the regional
structure of national securities portfolios to
be identical in all countries and to correspond
to the global portfolio.1In the real world,
however, securities portfolios differ consider-
ably from this ideal “benchmark” in nearly all
countries and display a distinct bias towards
domestic securities. This phenomenon, re-
ferred to in the literature as “home bias”, is
attributable largely to transactions costs in
the broadest sense of the term and to imper-
fectly informed investors, especially with re-
gard to securities issued by non-residents.2
The regional composition of the long-term se-
curities (shares, mutual fund shares and debt
securities with a maturity of more than one
year) featuring in Germany’s external assets
position will be examined in depth below.
The global portfolio is represented by the se-
curities portfolios of the euro area (changing
composition), the United Kingdom, Japan
and the United States.3
Since the introduction of the euro, there has
been a tendency towards a reduction in the
home bias of German investors’ securities
portfolios.4The share of domestic instru-
ments in German investors’ securities port-
folio has dropped from as much as 79% at the
beginning of monetary union to 58% at the
end of 2007. At both reference dates, German
securities made up 6% of the global portfolio
(see the chart on page 25). At the beginning ofmonetary union, the securities of other euro-
area countries were slightly underrepresented
in German portfolios at 11% compared with
their share of the global market (12%). How-
ever, their share has been continuously rising
and is now around 12 percentage points high-
er than the benchmark. The decline in domes-
tic investors’ home bias has therefore coin-
cided with a growing preference for instru-
ments from the rest of the euro area (euro-
area bias).
The regional structure of securities liabilities
can also be studied in a similar manner. It
turns out that, in the past few years, the per-
centage of German securities held by non-
residents has increased, too. Whereas around
95% of the securities outstanding worldwide
have been in the portfolios of non-residents
(from a German perspective) – with practically
little change since the introduction of the
euro – only 27% of German securities were
held by non-residents at the beginning of
1999. By the end of 2007, this percentage had
risen to 47%. The situation is somewhat dif-
ferent vis-/C224-vis the rest of the euro area. In-
vestors in the euro area excluding Germany
were already the holders of 16% of German
securities at the end of 2001, 6 percentage
points higher than their share of the global
portfolio.5In subsequent years, the euro-area
bias grew even more intensely on the liability
side of Germany’s external position (to 26%
compared with the theoretical benchmark of
14%). What is particularly noteworthy is the
high percentage of German debt securities
outstanding held by investors who are resi-
dent in the rest of the euro area (31%) owing
to the liquidity and security these instruments
provide.

25credit and liquidity advantages for investors,
however, they appear to be an attractive“safe haven” for foreign investors, particular-ly in times of heightened market tension. Arole was also played by supply-side influencessuch as the temporary increase in issues ofpublic bonds in Germany as a result of higherbudgetary deficits at the beginning of thisdecade and increased direct refinancing inthe capital market. In addition, central andstate government tried to make their issuesappealing to national and particularly inter-national investors, for example, by increasingissue volumes, publishing an issue calendarand jointly issuing jumbo bonds.
10As men-
tioned above, banks increasingly sought refi-nancing in the international capital market.
More recent empirical studies also confirm
the above trends from another perspective.They show that the share and bond portfoliosof German investors did, in fact, becomemore international in the period under re-view, despite a persistently substantial devi-ation from the “theoretical benchmark” re-sulting from the international Capital AssetPricing Model (CAPM). The same trend canbe seen in foreign portfolio investment inGermany. Germany’s financial relationshipswith other euro-area countries go – by con-trast – well beyond the dimensions attributedto the euro area because of its economicweight (see explanations on p 24). Hence,the decreasing home bias seems to havebeen offset by an increased euro-area bias.More broadly-based econometric studies,
which take into account other determinantsof portfolio investments, such as trade inte-gration, information differentials and geo-graphical distance, also support this hypoth-esis. Financial globalisation seems – at least inthe case of bonds – not to be uniform, but ra-ther to lead to strong mutual ties betweeneuro-area countries.

26Deuts che Bun desbankRe gional break down of German se curities lia bilities
according to the Coor dinate d Portfolio Investment Survey
The re gional classiﬁ  cation of a country ’s se curities lia bili-
ties is generally frau ght with difﬁ culties. At a national 
level, usually only the dire ct pur chaser can be re corded 
statisti cally an d not the a ctual hol der of a se curity.1 This 
pro blem also o ccurs when drawin g up the German inter-
national investment position. Thus, on a ccount of the 
importan ce of the City of Lon don, the Unite d Kin gdom 
plays a dominant role in the dire ct pur chase of German 
securities. The Coor dinate d Portfolio Investment Survey 
(CPIS), a survey of portfolio sto cks in in dividual countries, 
whi ch the IMF has coor dinate d for several years an d in 
whi ch Germany also parti cipates, now offers consi der-
able a dditional information whi ch can be use d to create 
a more relia ble pi cture of the forei gn hol ders of German 
securities.2
A total of 74 countries currently take part in the survey. 
At the en d of 200 6 – the most re cent year for whi ch data 
are availa ble – they re corded portfolio investments of 
aroun d U S$32,400 billion. The Unite d States an d the 
Unite d Kin gdom, the two countries with the lar gest 
securities markets, play the most important role in both 
the provision an d absorption of fun ds. Furthermore, 
the mutual ties between them are ex ceptionally stron g. 
At the en d of 200 6, German se curities worth U S$2,540 
billion (or €1,929 billion) were reporte d to be in forei gn 
han ds. This lar gely correspon ded to the German se cu-rities lia bilities that were re corded at that time in the 
international investment position (€1,931 billion).3
The CPIS therefore essentially offers a useful data base 
for analysin g the break down of hol ders of German se cu-
rities a broa d. However, it must also be remem bere d that 
economi cally important countries, su ch as China, In dia 
or oil-pro ducing countries in the Mi ddle East, do not 
take part in the survey. Another disa dvanta ge is that it 
takes more than a year for the data to become availa ble. 
Therefore, at the current en d, a djustments nee d to be 
ma de to the way the data are use d.
The re gional classiﬁ  cation is base d on the total sto ck of 
German se curities hel d abroa d. The total sto ck appearin g 
in the international investment position will continue to 
be calculate d this year usin g the cumulate d net turnover 
in the balan ce of payments (see the annex on pp 28-32).4
The sto cks are value d at prevailin g market pri ces usin g

instruments. The total sto ck is allo cate d to the in dividual 
countries in two steps.

Methodological notes on the international
investment position
The international investment position (IIP) is a
financial statement setting out a country’s external
financial assets and liabilities valued at market
prices at a specific reference date. The holdings
included in the IIP , or to be more precise changes
in these holdings, reflect not only financial transac-
tions, which are also included in the balance of
payments, but also changes to market prices and
exchange rates within a given period. The IIP is
drawn up on the basis of the IMF’s Balance of Pay-
ments Manual (fifth edition).12
The asset and liability positions included in the IIP
(external receivables and payables) are broken
down by domestic sector. These sectors comprise
monetary financial institutions (MFIs), enterprises
and individuals, general government, and the Bun-
desbank as the monetary authority. On the asset
side, data are broken down by the domestic sector
holding the asset; the IIP reflects the market value
of a sector’s external financial assets. By contrast,
items on the liability side are broken down by the
domestic sector of issuance; the IIP therefore
measures the market value of a sector’s external li-
abilities.
Monetary financial institutions include all institu-
tions that accept deposits or near-deposits from
non-MFIs and grant loans for their own account
and/or invest in securities. The MFI sector therefore
comprises all credit institutions resident in Ger-
many and domestic money market funds. The
Bundesbank, as the national central bank, is not
included in this sector for the purposes of the IIP .The enterprises and individuals sector includes all
enterprises and individuals based or resident in
Germany (both employed and self-employed per-
sons and all other private individuals) as well as
insurance and investment companies and their
funds, with the exception of money market funds,
which are classified as MFIs.
Besides central, state and local government, the
general government sector also includes the social
security funds.
The Bundesbank as the national central bank rep-
resents the fourth sector and provides information
on reserve assets, other claims arising from secur-
ities as well as receivables and payables arising
from loans and deposits.
In addition, the IIP includes a breakdown by under-
lying instrument. These are divided into the main
categories direct investment, portfolio investment
and other capital investments (mainly loans and
deposits), and reserve assets, which are relevant
only for the Bundesbank.
Direct investment comprises participating interests,
for instance in the form of equities and other cap-
ital stakes, and also loans to affiliated enterprises
abroad provided the stakeholding or the share of
voting rights held is at least 10%. In addition, dir-
ect investment includes cross-border ownership of
real estate.
Portfolio investment includes equities, where these
are not counted as direct investment, as well as

The Bundesbank’s reserve assets comprise gold
holdings, claims on the IMF (Special DrawingRights, or SDRs, and the IMF reserve position) andforeign currency reserves.
Data sources and data compilationThe IIP is published quarterly, three months after
the end of the reference quarter, and annually,nine months after the end of the reference year.The annual IIP differs from the quarterly IIP in thatits data base is more exact. Once the annual IIP hasbeen drawn up, the previously published quarterlydata are adjusted and/or revised. The informationfor the quarterly IIP are frequently based on esti-mates. By contrast, when determining the year-end positions to be published in September, all IIPitems are recalculated from scratch taking intoconsideration the primary statistical data that havesince become available. The calculation is basednot only on the current reporting year, but also in-cludes the last four reporting years including theassociated quarterly data. In geographical terms,the year-end levels are also broken down to thelevel of the individual countries specified in thecountry list. Consequently, any major methodo-logical changes and/or revisions have in the pastbeen carried out in September of the year con-cerned and then made public in a press release.
The IIP should always be calculated using the avail-
able stock data. Here, the Bundesbank can drawon banking statistics in the form of banks’ monthly
balance sheet statistics and external status as wellas enterprises’ external status. Statistics on directinvestment stocks are based on the annual reportson direct investment abroad submitted by enter-prises
13and individuals and the reports of foreign
enterprises and individuals on their direct invest-ment in Germany. This information is also used toestablish the IIP . The statistics on investment fundsare also included in the calculation of the IIP . Anadditional source of data – securities deposit statis-tics, which reflect domestic and foreign depositors’securities holdings with domestic custodian bankson a security-by-security basis every quarter – wasadded at the end of 2005. In addition, the Bundes-bank’s accounting division also provides monthlydata with which to calculate its external position.
Transactions (buying and selling) may result in
changes in holdings, or their value may fluctuateas a result of stock price and market price move-ments. The IIP therefore includes not only stockdata but also balance of payment transaction re-ports provided by resident MFIs and enterprises.The latter are used to establish estimates where noup-to-date stock data are available. In this case,turnover is aggregated, and individual holdings aredetermined using additional calculations and esti-mates.
The annual stock statistics on direct investment are
the basis on which the appropriate IIP positions arecalculated. All enterprises and individuals in Ger-many which hold stakes or voting rights of 10% ormore in an enterprise abroad or in which foreigninvestors own a stake or voting rights of 10% ormore are required to submit a report. Currently,

30those with a balance sheet total of less than 33
million are exempt.
The sub-item equity capital is calculated from nom-
inal capital data and the pro-rata reserves. Since
the reporting year 2004, capital stakes in listed
enterprises are valued at market prices based on
stock prices as at the reference date. Equity capital
in non-listed enterprises is valued at the respective
book values as listed in the enterprises’ balance
sheets on the reporting date.
Direct investment loans may take the form of loans
by direct investors to their affiliates or of reverse
investment, ie loans extended by subsidiaries to
their parent companies. Here, the “directional
principle” applies for statistical purposes. Under
this principle, all credit transactions that can be
traced back to a German investment abroad, ie
both parent companies’ claims against their for-
eign subsidiaries and the parent companies’ liabil-
ities to their foreign affiliates, are booked on the
asset side of the IIP . The German parent com-
panies’ credit liabilities to their foreign subsidiaries
are deducted from their credit claims. The liability
side, by contrast, depicts the financial ties between
foreign parent companies and their domestic sub-
sidiaries. Again, the foreign parent companies’
credit liabilities to their German subsidiaries are de-
ducted from their credit claims. Loans are reported
at book value. Where an MFI is involved in the
credit relationship between affiliated enterprises,
either as a lender or borrower, the receivables or
payables in question are counted not as direct
investment but as financial loans.
The item real estate comprises the domestic and
foreign real estate holdings of banks, enterprises
and individuals. It is classified as direct investment.
As there are no stock statistics for this item, figureshave to be estimated on the basis of aggregate
balance of payments transactions and valued at
prevailing market prices. The Federal Statistical
Office provides a special price index for domestic
real estate, while foreign property and real estate
are valued with the aid of a price index drawn up
by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).
The annual direct investment stock statistics are
not available until around 15 months after the end
of the reference year. In order to be able to provide
up-to-date information on equity capital despite
this delay, the transactions as recorded in the bal-
ance of payments statistics, which have been con-
ducted in the meantime, are added to the latest
available stock statistics. Direct investment loans
are also estimated for periods for which no bal-
ance sheet information is available.
With the publication of the IIP for year-end 2007,
securities holdings were, for the first time, deter-
mined using real security-by-security stock statis-
tics. However, this procedure is currently applied
only to the asset side, ie to foreign securities held
by German investors, and to reporting periods
from the end of 2006.
Pursuant to an ECB guideline (2004/15), portfolio
investment for the IIP should always be measured
on a security-by-security basis. The percentage of
holdings not determined on a security-by-security
basis must not exceed 15% of total securities
claims and liabilities on the reference date. To com-
ply with ECB requirements, the Bundesbank’s se-
curities deposit statistics were extended according-
ly at the end of 2005. Since then, German custo-
dian banks report their own portfolio holdings and
their clients’ securities holdings on a security-by-
security basis once a quarter. The Centralised

By mer-ging information on both security-by-security hold-ings and securities master data in one database,various securities aggregates such as securitiesreceivables and payables for the IIP can be deter-mined comparatively flexibly.
Securities claims for the reporting periods prior to
the end of 2006 were determined by aggregatingthe securities sales and purchases listed in the bal-ance of payments per type of security. To this end,the transaction values from the balance of pay-ments statistics were converted into nominal val-ues with the aid of average stock market pricesand exchange rates or indices during a period andadded to the nominal holdings of the precedingperiod. Holdings at market prices were based onnominal holdings valued at the stock market pricesand exchange rates on the reference date. TheMorgan Stanley Composite Index was used todetermine the market value of nominal foreignshare holdings, while information provided byJP Morgan and data from Merrill Lynch on interestrates and yields by type of bond and remainingtime to maturity was used for bonds.
However, this calculation method was not applied
to MFIs’ securities claims, as these holdings werereported as part of the monthly balance sheet stat-istics, or to foreign money market paper, for whichstock data had already been supplied in the past.
To date, it had been assumed that general govern-
ment holds no securitised external assets. Conse-quently, no holdings were reported on the assetside of the IIP for this sector. As the new securitiesdeposit statistics show that general governmentdoes indeed invest in foreign securities, albeit at
comparatively low levels, the appropriate informa-tion was included in the IIP for the reportingperiods from the end of 2006 onwards when theprocedure for collecting statistics was revamped.
The collection procedure pursuant to ECB/2004/15
is scheduled to be introduced on the liability side in2009. It is to be phased in gradually and concludedwith the presentation of the annual IIP for 2008 inthe autumn of 2009. German securities liabilitiesare currently still calculated merely by aggregatingbalance of payments transactions, ie much as se-curities claims were for the reporting periods priorto the end of 2006. Domestic shares are valued atmarket prices based on the DAX. Bonds issued byboth the public and private sectors and reportedon the liability side are valued at average prices aslisted in the issuance statistics.
By contrast, the future compilation of real stock
data is intended to allow securities liabilities, too,to be measured more precisely than in the past.Unlike securities claims, however, holdings of Ger-man securities cannot be determined by question-ing foreign investors directly, nor can this informa-tion be reliably gleaned from data provided by cus-todian banks. They are therefore determined indir-ectly using the subtraction method. Two stockmeasures are necessary to apply the subtractionmethod on a security-by-security basis: the totalvolume of the domestic security in circulation (iethe original issuance volume minus any redemp-tions) and the total volume of this security held byresidents (resident holdings). The IIP securitiesliabilities, ie the volume of domestic securitiesowned by non-residents, are then calculated as thedifference between total volume in circulation andresident holdings.

33Development of tax
revenue in Germany
and current tax policy
issuesOver the last ten years, tax revenue in
Germany fluctuated greatly and, at
times, unexpectedly. This was due, in
particular, to the extremely volatile
nature of profit-related taxes. Overall,
the tax ratio rose and, at the end of
the period under review, was high
even by historical standards. This rise
was driven by increases in consumption-
related taxes, which significantly out-
weighed the tax relief which was
granted predominantly by the reform
of income tax and business tax in 2000.
By contrast, the combined tax and
social contributions ratio declined on
balance. The increased allocation of
taxes towards co-funding the social se-
curity schemes was one of the factors
which contributed to the diverging
trends in the tax ratio and the com-
bined tax and social contributions ratio.
An efficient tax and social contribu-
tions system and a contained tax bur-
den are essential for creating an envir-
onment conducive to growth. A more
transparent system could help improve
the degree of public acceptance and
reduce distortions. Thus the need to
lower tax rates and limit special provi-
sions for many types of taxes remains
on the tax policy agenda. Furthermore,
the degree of equivalence between so-
cial contributions and corresponding
insurance benefits for the contributor
could be strengthened by adopting a
coherent strategy of tax-funding non-
insurance-related benefits.

34General trends in the tax ratio and the
combined tax and social contributions
ratio over the last ten years
Over the course of the last ten years, Ger-
many has seen some extremely volatile and
erratic developments in its tax revenue. This
has been a major contributory factor to the
considerable fluctuations in the general gov-
ernment deficits. Sharp revenue growth from
1997 up to the turn of the century was fol-
lowed by a phase of decidedly weak revenue
growth against the backdrop of an unfavour-
able macroeconomic momentum and com-
prehensive income tax cuts. This situation
only reversed around the middle of the cur-
rent decade and was notably reinforced by
the substantial additional revenue ensuing
from the raising of the standard VAT rate lastyear. By the end of 2007 the tax ratio, that is
tax revenue in relation to gross domestic
product (GDP), again edged closer to the
high level recorded in 2000, which is also ele-
vated in a longer-term comparison (see adja-
cent chart and table on page 35 for details on
the figures and the box on page 37 for the
statistical concept). The high revenue volatility
was due not only to legislative changes but
also to the development of profit-related
taxes, which fluctuated wildly and often un-
predictably. At the end of the period under
review, the level of revenue from profit-
related taxes probably again distinctly ex-
ceeded the medium-term trend.
Consumption tax rates have been raised
across the board as part of changes in tax le-
gislation. By contrast, income tax rates (in-
cluding business taxes) have been lowered,
and this was offset only in part by counterfi-
nancing measures.1Nevertheless, there was
only a slight shift in relative weights from
income-related taxes to consumption-related
taxes on balance as, in the wake of rising in-
come, the progressive structure of the income
tax regime causes the income tax burden to
increase automatically over time (fiscal drag)
and the assessment bases for consumption-
related taxes grew relatively sluggishly.
While on balance the tax ratio increased by
11/C252percentage points over the last ten years
to 241/C252% in 2007, the combined tax and so-
cial contributions ratio (ratio of revenue from
taxes and social contributions to GDP) de-As a percentage of GDP

35creased by 11/C252percentage points to 41%.
This was associated with a clear rise in theshare of taxes relative to social contribu-tions and a perceptible shift in the rev-enue structure from income-related levies toconsumption-related taxes. The social contri-butions ratio fell mainly because socialsecurity spending in relation to GDP waslower in 2007 than it was in 1997 and thetax-financed share of the social securityfunds was lifted significantly by a substantialtopping-up of Federal grants. A factor con-tributing to the decline of the ratio was thenet lowering of contribution rates to the so-cial security funds between 1997 and 2007.An even weightier factor was that the growthof the assessment bases for contribution re-ceipts (gross wages and salaries, in particular)lagged behind that of GDP . In terms of publicfinances as a whole, a decline in the wage
ratio means that both the general govern-ment revenue and expenditure ratios fallalmost automatically (that is without fiscalpolicy intervention) as numerous social bene-fits on the expenditure side are linked to theaverage growth of wages and remunerationin the public sector is also based on thisgrowth.

36the EU average (see chart on page 34).2By
contrast, the German tax ratio is compara-
tively low; however, unlike in other EU coun-
tries, the social security system in Germany is
financed to a large extent by social contribu-
tions (rather than taxes). When comparing
the tax and social contributions burden at
international level, it is therefore advisable to
consider taxes and social contributions jointly.
Hence overall tax and social contributions
ratios, but also GDP ratios for individual tax
and contribution types, are a customary inter-
national basis for analysing and classifying
the development of taxes and social contribu-
tions as well as their impact on public
finances. However, conclusions with regard
to the underlying concrete burdens based
on revenue-related observations should bedrawn with caution. For instance, social con-
tributions function less as a distortionary tax
if they are more closely linked to the social
benefits accruing to the contributor (equiva-
lence principle). Similarly, differences in the
extent to which the recipient is taxed on so-
cial benefits (gross or net payment) or the
possibility of providing a subsidy either by
means of financial assistance or tax conces-
sions, can significantly inhibit comparability.
In addition, the ratio is influenced by the com-
bination of the legislative setting and eco-
nomic agents’ behaviour, ie it also dependentDevelopment of tax ratios and their determinants*

37on their (legal and illegal) evasive reactions. A
high tax rate could, for example, lead to low
ratios if tax payers partially evade taxation.
One approach which is independent of such
behavioural reactions but instead more
strongly affected by model assumptions is,
for example, to calculate the wage income
burden using the tax wedge. In this method,
the relative gap between employers’ labour
costs and employees’ net wages is analysed
for stylised employee groups. Effective bur-
dens for sample companies are calculated for
enterprises. A number of different studies
conducted in this field indicate that tax and
social contribution burdens have declined
considerably owing to rate cuts over the last
ten years but that, by international standards,
Germany still has a relatively high burden.3
Individual determinants of the tax ratio
trend4
The following section provides a more de-
tailed breakdown of the development of tax
revenue in Germany outlined above. The dis-
aggregated framework for analysing public
finances is used for this purpose, which
shows the individual explanatory factors (see
also the box on page 38). In this method, theNotes on statistical concepts
Unless indicated otherwise, the revenue develop-
ment is described as defined in the national ac-
counts, and the tax ratio includes the levies paid
to the EU.1One important difference vis-/C224-vis the
definition used in the government’s budgetary
financial statistics is that payments of grants to
homeowners and investors and of child benefit
are offset there against tax revenue, ie they re-
duce revenue, whereas they are treated as gov-
ernment expenditure in the national accounts. In
addition, in the national accounts revenue is
allocated not to the year of receipt but to the
year of origin.
The national accounts generally differentiate
between current taxes on income, wealth etc
(direct taxes), taxes on production and imports
(indirect taxes) and capital taxes. Here, however,
a classification is used that is more oriented
towards the underlying tax assessment bases.
The term “income-related taxes” comprises wage
tax, assessed income tax, investment income tax,
corporation tax and local business tax. This classi-
fication is different from the “direct taxes” as
defined in the national accounts, particularly
since, in the national accounts, local business tax
is assigned to the category of indirect taxes. The
category of income-related taxes is subdivided
into wage tax and (other) “profit-related taxes”.
However, it should be noted that wage tax mere-
ly represents a special method of levying income
tax. Deviations from the actual tax liability (eg
owing to additional deductions or additional in-
come) are offset in the course of the income tax
assessment procedure and reduce the receipts
from assessed income tax. Turnover tax, energy
tax, electricity tax, tobacco tax and insurance tax
as well as the other special excise duties are clas-
sified as “consumption-related taxes”.
As is customary (also at international level), the
ratios are calculated in relation to GDP. Another
way of evaluating the withdrawal of funds by
means of levies, in principle, would be to con-
sider the ratio in relation to national income
(and thus to factor income) after deducting de-
preciation, among other things. However, this
alters the general trends only modestly, although
the ratios are naturally significantly higher (in
2007 the ratio of national income to GDP was
75.4%).
1The analysis of the European Commission (2008a), op
cit, is based on a definition and classification that is for
the most part comparable with the one used here.

38Deutsche BundesbankThe disaggregated framework for analysing public finances
Outline of the framework1
Under the disaggregated framework, the develop-
ment of the revenue and expenditure ratios can be
explained in more detail. Revenue developments in
the major taxes and social contributions are attrib-
uted within a model-based procedure to the (esti-
mated) impact of legislative changes and the evolu-
tion of macroeconomic reference variables. To this
end, appropriate reference variables are selected and
revenue elasticities (percentage change in receipts
when the variable is changed by 1%) and lag struc-
tures (temporal relationship between the evolution of
the reference variable and payment of the tax or so-
cial contribution) are defined (see also table on p 39).
The revenue models used under the framework are
relatively simple and standardised, and correspond in
principle to those used for revenue forecasting, for
example. They are therefore also suitable, among
other things, for modelling revenue windfalls, which
are the subject of some discussion.
Analysing extraordinary developments
Revenue developments cannot usually be fully ex-
plained using the standardised revenue models of the
disaggregated framework, so that some unexplained
components (residuals) remain. These arise, for ex-
ample, because the models capture regular and aver-
age relationships but cannot record special factors.
Thus, a certain relationship is seen between the unex-
plained weak development in turnover tax receipts in
2001 and an increase in turnover tax fraud (including
“carousel transactions”). This manifests itself as a
negative residual. However, the above example also
demonstrates that specifically identifying and quanti-
fying special factors can be difficult.
Problems in assessing the financial impact of legisla-
tive changes are a further cause of unexplained re-
siduals. The calculations for this report were largely
based on the estimates carried out by the Federal Gov-
ernment as part of the legislative process. The particu-
lar problem with this is that the estimates are often
dependent on the forecasts for the economic and rev-
enue development made at the time of estimation ( exante approach). A subsequent adjustment to the ac-
tual outturn has been carried out here only in isolated
cases – primarily for changes to the rates of consump-
tion-related taxes ( ex post approach). Despite these
limitations, the explanatory power of the revenue
models can be significantly improved by including
the estimates regarding the impact of legislative
changes.2
The revenue elasticities are also ultimately estimates,
and inaccuracies here can likewise lead to residuals.
For taxes or social contributions for which the rates
are, in principle, proportional, the elasticities are set
to one. For income tax, the elasticity is set at greater
than one owing to the progressive tax scale. This
results in a positive fiscal drag, ie revenue increases
automatically.3Furthermore, particular account is
taken of the fact that excise taxes are largely volume-
related and their receipts are consequently independ-
ent of price developments. Technically speaking, the
elasticity to the relevant deflator is thus zero. The re-
sultant decline in the tax ratio is likewise described as
a (negative) fiscal drag.
Another cause of residuals in the disaggregated
framework is that the actual tax assessment bases are
not directly observable. For this reason, macroeco-
nomic indicators which are also often used in revenue
forecasts are applied to measure their development.
In some cases, however, additional information with
which the actual tax assessment bases can be better
approximated becomes available ex post . By including
this additional information, the explanatory power of
the models can be improved, although this also ren-
ders them more complex. For example, this occurs in
the case of turnover tax when allowing for the fact
that the differently taxed components of the VAT as-
sessment bases (standard rate, reduced rate, exempt)
have developed differently, leading the effective aver-
age tax rate to change. Furthermore, the consump-
tion volume figures used for energy and tobacco taxes
show a much weaker development than that of real
private consumption, which is used as the reference
variable in the standard model. This provides an ex-
planation for some of the negative residuals in the
case of excise taxes.

39Volatile revenue from profit-related taxes
As the chart on page 43 demonstrates, the revenue
development can generally be explained quite satis-
factorily using these more detailed (in comparison
with the figures in the table below) revenue models;
this means – in the terminology of the disaggregated
framework – that a larger part of the development
can be attributed to fiscal drag and structural shifts
within GDP. For the profit-related taxes, however, the
models’ explanatory power in individual years is limit-
ed, and considerable residuals remain even after re-
finements. This is due, among other things, to the fact
that the macroeconomic reference variables – entre-
preneurial and property income and its sub-compon-
ents – are only relatively loosely connected with the
actual tax assessment bases. In particular, fluctuation
in the tax assessment bases over the economic cycle
seems to be significantly greater than that in the
macroeconomic variables. For example, tax-relevant
value adjustments are not recognised in entrepre-
neurial and property income as defined in the nation-
al accounts. The lag structures for the assessed taxes
(assessed income tax, corporation tax, local business
tax) are probably likewise very variable over time –
contrary to the assumption in the models. At the end
of a phase of relatively strong profit growth, for ex-
ample, large advance payments often coincide with
large back payments (and vice versa following a
period of relatively weak growth). Additionally, theextensive legislative changes in this area cause estima-
tion difficulties.
This problem is illustrated in the chart on page 44.
Although, after adjustment for cyclical components
estimated using the standard procedure and for the
impact of legislative changes, the trend in profit-
related tax receipts was similar to that in entrepre-
neurial and property income, there were massive fluc-
tuations in revenue in individual years.
Relationship with cyclical adjustmentThe revenue models on which the disaggregated
framework is based are also used in the Bundesbank’s
disaggregated standard cyclical adjustment procedure
for estimating the cyclical component of the general
government fiscal balance. In this procedure, the
trend deviations of the relevant macroeconomic vari-
ables are calculated using the Hodrick-Prescott filter
(smoothing parameter /C21=30) and are used, with the
aid of the elasticities, to determine the cyclical impact
on the individual types of revenue. On the expend-
iture side, an analogous procedure is used to estimate
the cyclical effects on spending on unemployment
and of the statutory pension insurance scheme. The
cyclical component of the fiscal balance is determined
by netting the individual cyclical influences on the
revenue and expenditure sides.

40actual evolution of revenue is compared with
a reference scenario in which tax revenue de-
velops in line with GDP and the tax ratio thus
remains constant.5Differences may be the
result of legislative changes, ie they may be
attributable to active fiscal policy measures. A
role may also be played by additional revenue
resulting from fiscal drag owing to the effects
of tax progression and any structural shifts
within GDP between components taxed at
different rates (taking turnover tax as an ex-
ample, between high tax-yielding domestic
consumption and low tax-yielding exports).
Changes in the tax ratio that cannot be ex-
plained by these three factors, which are
termed residuals, have to be analysed in more
detail. They can, in part, be explained by spe-
cial developments and the high level of ab-
straction of the underlying revenue models.
Changes in tax law lead to considerable
additional revenue
Between 1997 and 2007, changes in tax law
had a significant impact on the development
of tax revenue. On balance, they brought
about a rise of over 1 percentage point in the
tax ratio, which for 2007 meant additional
revenue of 330 billion (for an overview of
the legislative changes, see the annex on
pages 53-57). A sharp increase in the con-
sumption tax ratio (+3 percentage points)
was partly offset by a clear fall in income-
related taxes (-2 percentage points).
The extensive rise and expansion of
consumption-related taxes – in the case of
energy tax and tobacco tax as well as turn-
over tax and insurance tax – was based partlyon the argument that social benefits were to
be financed to a greater extent out of general
tax revenue. Thus the Federal grants to the
social security funds have increased substan-
tially since 1997, which per se created scope
to lower the contribution rates to the social
security funds with a revenue volume of 11/C252%
of GDP in 2007 (see the box on page 41).
In effect, the ratio of social contributions to
GDP fell on balance by a mere1/C252percentage
point as a result of relief measures (lower con-
tribution rates, in particular) as other factors
impacted negatively on the financial situation
of the social security funds.6In addition to
co-financing the social security funds, tax in-
creases – especially the hike in VAT and insur-
ance tax in 2007 – were closely linked to the
need to consolidate government budgets,
which showed large deficits, and they were
explicitly justified by the need to plug struc-
tural budgetary gaps.7Partly thanks to this,
the structural deficit declined noticeably.
Legislative changes between 1997 and 2007
provided considerable relief in respect of
income-related taxes, causing the tax ratio to
fall by almost 2 percentage points on bal-
ance. A key element in this was the income
tax and business tax reform adopted in 2000
in the context of a comparatively comfortable
budgetary position and outlook at that time.
5The developments described below remain valid after
adjustment for standard cyclical components as the cyc-
lical components of the numerator (revenue) and the de-
nominator (GDP) develop broadly in parallel and the im-
pact on the revenue ratio is therefore small. As for the
ratios, cyclical fluctuations are reflected primarily in the
development of the expenditure ratio.

41Additional Federal grants to the social security funds and
associated tax increases since 1997
Federal grants to the social security funds have
been increased substantially over the past ten
years in order to stabilise contribution rates. In
most instances, taxes were raised simultaneously.
Since social contributions are perceived as and act
like a tax (owing to the limited equivalence be-
tween contributions and benefits accruing to the
contributor), this essentially means that one tax
was replaced with another. It cannot be ruled out,
however, that retrenchment efforts from the so-
cial security funds may then have subsided owing
to an easing of financial pressure and that some
of the Federal grants were used to cover addition-
al expenditure. Nonetheless, it can be assumed
that there was an overall redistribution of fund-
ing from tax payers to contribution payers. This
was intended, among other things, so as to better
align non-insurance-related benefits with tax
grants. In the following sections, the additional
revenue generated through specific tax rises be-
tween 1997 and 2007 is compared with the great-
er leeway for lowering contribution rates result-
ing from the increases in the Federal grants. How-
ever, it should be borne in mind that a further rise
in the Federal grants, particularly those to the
statutory health insurance scheme, is planned for
the coming years.
In 1998, the general Federal grant to the statutory
pension insurance scheme was supplemented by
an additional Federal grant. Since 1999, moreover,
the Federal Government has been paying contri-
butions to cover child-rearing periods. To finance
this, the standard rate of VAT was increased on
1 April 1998 and energy tax was increased in sev-
eral stages (“ecological tax reform”). While the
general Federal grant amounted to just over 535
billion in 1997, the general and additional Federal
grants reached a total of 5671/C252billion in 2007. In
1997, the contribution rate was kept just over
41/C252percentage points lower with the aid of the
Federal grants; by 2007, this effect had increased
to nearly 81/C252percentage points. The difference
(over 31/C252percentage points) was worth almost
5291/C252billion in 2007. Additional revenue from the
aforementioned tax rises came to a total of 526
billion in 2007.
A Federal grant was paid to the statutory health
insurance scheme for the first time in 2004 and
was financed through a rise in tobacco tax rates.
The grant was raised from an initial 51 billion to
54.2 billion in 2006, but was cut again to 52.5 bil-
lion in 2007. It is planned to increase the Federalgrant in stages from 2009 onwards from 51.5 bil-
lion annually to 514 billion (from 2016 onwards).
Without the Federal grant of 52.5 billion, the con-
tribution rate would have needed to be1/C254per-
centage point higher in 2007. The additional rev-
enue generated from the increase in tobacco tax
was also around 521/C252billion in 2007.
Until 2006, the Federal Employment Agency’s def-
icits were offset in full by the Federal Govern-
ment. In 2007, a rule-based Federal grant was
introduced. It is no longer envisaged that the Fed-
eral Employment Agency’s deficits will be auto-
matically offset using funds from the Federal
budget; the Agency must therefore compensate
for cyclical fluctuations using its own reserves.
This requires a contribution rate which ensures a
balanced budget over the economic cycle and suf-
ficient reserves to avoid incurring debt. The new
Federal grant is to be funded using one-third of
the additional revenue generated from increasing
the standard rate of VAT from 16% to 19%. In
2007, this additional tax revenue of an estimated
57 billion (the corresponding cash receipts were
still relatively low in the year of the increase) was
accompanied by a Federal grant of 561/C252billion, ie
just over3/C254percentage point of the contribution
rate. In future, the Federal grant will be adjusted
on the basis of turnover tax revenue. 1
Overall, the Federal grants to the social security
funds in 2007 were around 5381/C252billion higher
than they would have been had the legislative
status quo from 1997 still been in force. This was
accompanied by additional revenue of 5351/C252bil-
lion arising from the specific tax increases. How-
ever, other measures reapportioning funding re-
sponsibilities have, on balance, considerably bur-
dened the social security funds to the benefit of
central, state and local government. These meas-
ures notably include the successive reductions in
contributions to the statutory pension, health and
long-term care insurance schemes paid out of the
Federal budget on behalf of recipients of un-
employment assistance. All in all, the additional
revenue from the tax increases of the past ten
years, for which the stated justification was refi-
nancing of the social security funds, and the
change in the payment flows between the social
security funds and central, state and local govern-
ment are likely to have opened up a potential to
lower the contribution rates of a similar magni-
tude.
1In 1997, the Federal Government used just under 55 bil-
lion to offset the Federal Employment Agency’s deficit.Under the assumption that, given the structural improve-ment in the labour market, no further transfers from theFederal Government budget would be required based on
the legislative status quo in force in 1997, here the currentgrant has not been netted with the offset of the 1997deficit.

42These measures lowered the tax rates consid-
erably. However, this was counterfinanced in
part by a broadening of the assessment bases
and, in addition, various revenue-boosting
measures in the area of income-related taxes
were adopted with the aim of budgetary con-
solidation.8
Fiscal drag raises tax ratio
With growing average income, the fixed
nominal progressive income tax regime gen-
erates much higher additional revenue than a
proportional tax regime. Consequently, over
time, tax revenue tends to grow faster than
GDP , thus also causing the tax ratio to rise.
Over the course of the last ten years, this fis-
cal drag accumulated to a total of 11/C252per-
centage points in 2007, the final year of the
period under review, thereby neutralising a
large part of the income tax relief described
above. Measured on the basis of the rate of
consumer price inflation, approximately two-
thirds of fiscal drag was due to higher infla-
tion (“cold progression”) while one-third was
attributable to real income growth.
Additional revenue ensuing from income tax
progression was accompanied by a negative
fiscal drag of approximately1/C252percentage
point in the case of consumption taxes. This
little heeded effect results from the fact that
excise duties are mainly charged based on
volume. For example, energy tax on petrol is
charged at a fixed amount per litre that re-
mains constant in the face of general price in-
creases. The revenue generated from this tax
loses real value over time and the ratio of
consumption-related taxes to GDP declines.Shifts in GDP structure lower tax ratio
In addition to changes in tax legislation and
fiscal drag, shifts in the relationship between
higher tax-yielding and lower tax-yielding GDP
components can automatically change the
tax ratio. Such shifts have lowered the tax
ratio by1/C252percentage point in the last ten
years. When interpreting this development,
however, it should be noted that it does not
reflect changes in the tax and social contribu-
tions burden for individual factors and thus
does not reflect tax relief.
The assessment bases for consumption-
related taxes in particular developed at a
much slower pace than nominal GDP , even
after the negative fiscal drag described above
has been factored out of the calculations. The
rises in tax rates had a major part to play in
this as they entailed a nominal increase in
consumption and GDP (at market prices) but
not in the assessment bases (before taxes).
This structural effect was particularly pro-
nounced in 2007 owing to the hike in the
standard rate of VAT. Furthermore, entrepre-
neurial and property income grew at a faster
pace than gross wages and salaries, which
shifted the relative weight from wage tax to
profit-related taxes.
8Although the 2000 reforms and also the 2008 business
tax reform were broadly acclaimed for the fact that the
lower tax rates would improve conditions for investment
in Germany, they were also criticised on the grounds of
systemic incoherence as inter alia they intensify the dis-
tortion of enterprises’ choice of form of financing and
legal form: see, for example, the German Council of Eco-
nomic Experts (2008 and 2008), 2000/01 and 2007/08

43Other factors with a significant impact
As a whole, tax developments over the last
ten years can largely be explained by the fac-tors mentioned above. However, in individualyears there were sizeable developments thatcould not be explained using the disaggre-gated framework (residuals). Profit-relatedtaxes, in particular, recorded an unexplainedhigh volatility, leading to large net additionalrevenue. By contrast, consumption taxesgrew far more slowly over time than was en-visaged in the standard framework.
As the disaggregated framework determines
“normal” revenue development using somekey macroeconomic reference variables, theresiduals can, in part, be explained using moredetailed revenue models (see chart on thispage and the box on pages 38 and 39). For
example, the development of consumption-related taxes can be captured much more ac-curately if the clearly shrinking proportion ofthe more highly taxed components of privateconsumption are taken into account in thecase of turnover tax or energy tax and to-bacco tax. Nevertheless, this still leaves somenoticeable discrepancies in individual years.For turnover tax, these could be partly due tochanges in the extent of tax fraud or taxshortfalls owing to insolvencies.
The residuals for profit-related taxes are par-
ticularly large and erratic. In some years, rev-enue swings amounting up to 1% of GDP(324 billion in 2007) could not be explained
using the more detailed approach either. Thisis probably due inter alia to the specific prob-As a percentage of GDP

44lems of estimating the effects of legislative
changes in this area of revenue. Furthermore,
the cyclical pattern suggests that the impact
of the changing level of macroeconomic ac-
tivity on revenue is underestimated in the
underlying models. Thus large positive re-
siduals were recorded for the “better” years
between 1998 and 2000 as well as 2006 and
2007, and sizeable negative residuals for
2001 and 2002. This may well owe some-thing to the fact that the actual assessment
bases for profit-related taxes are more volatile
than the proxy entrepreneurial and property
income shown in the national accounts,
which is used as the macroeconomic refer-
ence variable in the disaggregated frame-
work. Moreover, changes in the relative
amounts of advance and back payments of
tax are likely to have magnified the cyclical
revenue fluctuations. As regards the level,
there are currently some grounds for suppos-
ing that, at the end of the period under re-
view, revenue from profit-related taxes ex-
ceeded its medium-term trend and that a
high setback potential exists (see chart on this
page).
Outlook fraught with uncertainty
According to the latest official tax estimate in
May 2008, the tax ratio is expected to remain
broadly unchanged until 2012.9Proceeds
from income-related taxes will increase more
rapidly than GDP on balance, with a relatively
weak rise in profit-related taxes (as a counter-
swing to the previous dynamic growth) likely
to be offset by additional revenue owing to
fiscal drag. The ratio of consumption-related
taxes, by contrast, is expected to fall, pre-
dominantly because the assessment bases
will probably continue to grow more slowly
than GDP .Log scale

45On the whole, tax revenue has grown at a
faster pace than expected so far this year.10
However, forecasts for the forthcoming
period are subject to considerable uncer-
tainty, in particular regarding the macroeco-
nomic outlook, the implications of the finan-
cial crisis and the level of revenue from profit-
related taxes, which is currently very high and
is prone to fluctuate greatly. Furthermore,
various tax cuts are in the offing. For ex-
ample, in addition to the planned increase in
the tax allowance for children, the basic
allowance may also be increased owing to
the recalculation of the minimum subsistence
level. Furthermore, the income tax allowance
for contributions to private health and long-
term care insurance schemes has to be raised
from 2010 at the latest following a ruling of
the Federal Constitutional Court. Depending
on the precise form that this will take and,
above all, on whether this will also apply to
persons insured in the corresponding statu-
tory schemes, this could mean substantial tax
revenue shortfalls. Overall, these factors are
likely to notably dent tax receipts vis-/C224-vis the
forecast on which the current medium-term
financial plan is based.
Some aspects of the current tax policy
debate
Need to factor tax forecast uncertainties
into budgetary rules
Tax forecasts – such as the regular official tax
estimate but also other projections – are
sometimes subject to considerable revision.
For instance, tax revenue cash flows in 2002(as defined in the government’s financial stat-
istics) were 321 billion lower than expected in
the official tax estimate from November
2001, while revenue in 2007 exceeded the
previous year’s forecast by 324 billion (see
chart). One reason why tax forecasts have to
be revised is because the macroeconomic ref-
erence variables were estimated incorrectly.€b n

46For example, the course of macroeconomic
development was weaker than forecast dur-
ing the period from 2001 to 2004, in particu-
lar, but then surpassed the expectations in
2006 and 2007. A major role is played, too,
by factors which are reflected in the residuals
in the disaggregated framework described
above and which are generally very hard to
predict. A factor which regularly poses major
headaches in this context is the strong volatil-ity of profit-related taxes, which can only be
partly explained using the customary estima-
tion models and accounts for a remarkably
large proportion of the estimation errors of
the past few years, especially given this item’s
relatively small share of overall revenue. But
corrections may also be caused by incorrect
estimates of the effects of legislative changes,
which are often difficult to quantify even ex
post and are then reflected as residuals in the
disaggregated framework.
Forecasting uncertainty, which at times is
considerable, hampers central and state gov-
ernment’s budgetary and medium-term fi-
nancial planning and its attempts to meet the
set targets. For example, if there is an insuffi-
cient margin of safety below the deficit ceil-
ings, unexpected tax shortfalls may necessi-
tate extensive fiscal policy corrections at short
notice. One particularly problematic aspect is
that it is often difficult to judge at that mo-
ment whether deviations from the estimates
are cyclical developments or whether a struc-
tural reassessment of the budgetary situation
is necessary. For example, only a minimal pro-
portion of the sharp and unexpected move-
ments in profit-related taxes can be attributed
to fluctuations in the commonly used macro-
economic reference variables (or even GDP).
The standard cyclical adjustment procedures
therefore only attribute a very small part of
them to the cyclical component of the fiscal
balance. The tax ratio adjusted for legislative
changes and standard cyclical effects is still
very volatile (and, in addition, tends to dem-
onstrate a cyclical pattern). An additional ad-

47of the volatility of profit-related taxes appears
to track the actual development more accur-ately (see chart on page 46).
11This extra ad-
justment markedly alters the picture of thebudgetary stance in individual years.
The estimation uncertainties described above
are also relevant for the current discussionsabout stricter national budgetary rules.
12If
deficit limits are strictly defined, extensive re-visions of the forecasts sometimes necessitateabrupt correction measures which impedethe attempt to pursue a medium-term fiscalpolicy. However, this is no reason to dispensewith strict rules. Instead, the likelihood of re-visions can be reflected in the rules by stipu-lating that targets which are missed as a re-sult of general, unexpected revenue develop-ments have to be corrected only over the me-dium term. As forecasts often tend to over-estimate tax revenue in economic downturnsand to underestimate it in upturns, such lee-way to adjust the budget plans (and the tar-get deficit/surplus) to the forecast errors overa longer period of time could also consider-ably strengthen the stabilising function ofpublic finances over the economic cycle. Toprevent the in-built leeway from being ab-used for deliberate mistargeting, debt result-ing from revisions to forecasts would have tobe generally restricted and limited to “genu-ine” estimation errors. There should be insti-tutional safeguards to ensure as far as pos-sible that the relevant estimates are unbiased,ie that they are not regularly overoptimistic.The same applies to approaches to assessingthe financial impact of legislative changes.Nevertheless, some estimation errors will re-main unavoidable. However, a rule-based ap-proach to dealing with the resulting deficits
could limit the short-term and procyclical ad-justment measures that are sometimes need-ed – including under current budget legisla-tion.
13
Reducing individual tax allowances
From a macroeconomic perspective, low tax
rates coupled with limited special tax allow-ances generally appears to be the optimal taxregime as this makes the tax system moretransparent and simple and reduces the riskof misallocation. A moderate and transparenttaxation system would increase public accept-ance and dampen the incentive to evade oravoid paying tax. Adherence to coherent sys-temic principles and a transparent tax systemcould also facilitate public comprehensionand discussion of changes to tax law and dis-courage the privileging of individual vestedinterests. This objective could be bolsteredby a shift away from tax subsidies towardsgranting financial assistance on the expend-iture side. In addition, it is crucial, however, toevaluate whether subsidies (whether grantedin the form of tax relief or financial assistance)actually serve the public interest and, if not,
11As with every trend adjustment procedure, caution
should be exercised when interpreting the trend level re-
sults, especially at the current end.

planatory notes on the table: it is very hard to detail the
tax revenue shortfalls that are likely to result from special
tax benefits as there is much controversy as to how these
items should be defined and there are widely varying views
on issues such as the allowance-free reference system. In
addition, the financial implications mostly have to be esti-
mated. Furthermore, with regard to the general trend, in
particular, it should be noted that the volume of tax bene-
fits can change not only due to fiscal policies but also, for
instance, due to changing take-up patterns. The definition
from the Kiel Subsidy Report has mainly been applied
here. Overall, this definition is broader than the definition
of subsidies used by central government as it includes most
tax subsidies defined in the government report (appen-
dix 2 of the government report) as well as a number of ad-
ditional tax regulations that are quantitatively important(predominantly those from appendix 3 of the government
report). However, the definition from the Kiel report was
modified to include the tax shortfalls resulting from the
savers’ allowance and supplementary private pension plans
as defined in appendix 2 of the government report.
Consequently, the volume given here is comparatively
high, although it would be possible to define subsidies
even more broadly. However, the definition selected here
does not purport to make a clear-cut demarcation but
rather to give a relatively comprehensive representation on
the basis of information that is generally available. In
particular, major controversial tax regulations are shown
separately. — 1Difference between the years stated. —

49to abolish them. As experience has shown
that cutting existing subsidies is an uphillstruggle, it is particularly important that atransparent and efficient subsidy policy beunderpinned by a regular and clear reportingsystem, including verifiable statements re-garding the respective targets, and greater re-course to duration limits.
14
The volume of tax subsidies is measured dif-ferently by different approaches. Accordingto a definition based on the Kiel Subsidy Re-port (and therefore, in particular, in line withthe government’s financial statistics), individ-ual tax allowances currently cause tax short-falls of approximately 350 billion or 8
1/C252%o f
revenue (see table on page 48). Although inthe legal status quo , the gap will narrow
somewhat in the coming years, the shortfallswill remain large. However, it is difficult tocomprehensively cut subsidies, as has beenseen in the last few years. In their “Joint Ini-tiative to Reduce Subsidies by Consensus” in2003, Roland Koch, prime minister of Hesseand a member of the Christian DemocraticUnion, and Peer Steinbr/C252ck, prime minister ofNorth Rhine-Westphalia and a member of theSocial Democratic Party, managed to agreeon a reduction for only around 47% of thetotal volume of tax allowances of 383
1/C252bil-
lion that they had identified in 2002.15In the
period that followed, many of the identifiedallowances were indeed abolished or curbedin a cross-party consensus. However, subsid-ies were greatly expanded at the same time,especially in the form of income tax deduc-tions for certain household services (eg homeimprovements) and tax allowances for dona-tions and non-profit-making activities. Regu-lar discussions about reducing or expanding
tax relief measures for turnover tax and thecurrent debate as to whether to re-expandthe commuting allowance, which has only re-cently been restricted, also highlight the diffi-culties involved. Nevertheless, it is importantand, given the associated distortions and insome cases large tax shortfalls, also worth-while to continue pursuing the objective ofcutting subsidies. When considering the costof tax benefits, the lack of systemic transpar-ency and the higher general tax and socialcontribution burden which they cause shouldlikewise be borne in mind.
Limiting fiscal dragThe primary aim of the progressive income
tax regime is to ensure that higher-earningtax payers make an above-average contribu-tion to tax revenue. Given steady generalincome growth, however, it leads to a con-tinuously rising burden for all income taxbrackets and to rising marginal tax burdensup to the top rate of taxation. The automaticstep-up into higher tax bands caused by thegrowth in nominal income is especially prob-lematic if nominal income growth is notmatched by a corresponding improvementin tax payers’ financial means measured interms of real income (cold progression).

of depreciation allowances that have since been abol-
ished (+ 3101/C252billion), tax allowances for contributions to
pension insurance (+ 315 billion) and the flat-rate allow-

50As the analysis of revenue growth has shown,
fiscal drag owing to the effects of tax pro-
gression has continuously caused additional
income tax burdens in Germany. For example,
in the period between 1997 and 2007, this
pushed up the tax ratio by 11/C252percentage
points (or 334 billion in 2007), and the ratio
could rise further by around 1 percentage
point (or in a magnitude of 320 billion with
regard to 2007) by 2012. The resulting add-itional revenue has already been earmarked
to help achieve the government’s aim of a
broadly balanced Federal budget, also in
structural terms, in the last medium-term
financial plan.
In the past, the government has responded to
these automatic tax increases at infrequent
intervals with tax rate reforms which again
reduced the income tax burden, at least tem-
porarily. For example, the reform adopted in
2000 cut income tax rates substantially, and
the current rates are significantly lower than
those in 1997, the start of the period under
review. However, this relief is largely neutral-
ised alone by the effect of cold progression.
When comparing real tax rates for 1997 and
2007 (see adjacent chart), it can be seen that
the average real burden has, in part, again
drawn closer to the 1997 figures and will
edge even closer by 2012 assuming con-
sumer prices rise as forecast in the medium-
term financial plan; and this comparison still
takes no account of the average additional
burden owing to general growth in real in-
comes.
The automatic increase in the income tax bur-
den owing to fiscal drag will thus continue in
the future to necessitate a regular review of
income tax rates and of the nominal deduc-
tion amounts. There have also been some
calls to at least adjust tax rates to price devel-
opments so as to prevent cold progression
from arising in the first place or at least to
mitigate its effects. While fiscal drag would
still occur, it would be restricted to cases
where tax payers’ financial means, measured
in terms of average real income, increase.Per-

51However, from a stability policy perspective,
there are serious reservations concerning alltypes of price indexation as its widespreaduse harbours the risk of high inflation ratesbecoming tolerated and entrenched. Shoulda rule-based antidote to cold progression beconsidered, then stability-oriented principleswould have to be adhered to. Therefore, therelevant nominal values should be adjustedonly within bounds compatible with price sta-bility, for instance using a constant annualrate. The strengthening of the automatic sta-bilisation function that is part of the progres-sive income tax system would be broadlymaintained.
Reorganising the method of financing
the social security funds
There are occasional calls to switch the basis
of financing the expenditure of the social se-curity funds more to general tax revenue onthe grounds that this would make the tax andsocial contributions system more efficientoverall and more conducive to growth. How-ever, it should be remembered that freeing la-bour from social contributions by raisingtaxes would cause distortions elsewhere and,on balance, these may not be any lower. Inthe frequently discussed theoretical case of arise in a general consumption tax with a sim-ultaneous lowering of general levies onwages, the assessment base broadens – andthe price effects, in particular, ensure thatexisting assets are also included in taxation.However, both types of taxes increase the taxwedge, ie the difference between real labourcosts for employers and real net wages foremployees. On the other hand, easing theburden primarily for employees and placing a
relatively heavier burden on existing assetsand pension claims should yield a more evenintergenerational distribution of burdens re-sulting from government activities. With re-gard to the social systems in Germany, itshould also be noted that social contributionsare generally paid by regular employees sub-ject to social contributions. The associatedspecific taxation of employees encouragesevasive reactions by switching to other formsof employment (such as self-employment andlow-paid part-time employment). While, onbalance, the burden imposed by general con-sumption taxation would probably be distrib-uted more evenly, more cautious expectationsshould be placed on the macroeconomicgrowth and employment effects of such ashift in the tax and social contributions sys-tem.
16
A principled and coherent approach appearsappropriate to deciding the fundamentalissue of how to finance the expenditure ofthe social security funds. In such an approach,tax grants ought to be transferred to thesocial security funds to cover the volume ofnon-insurance-related benefits, while tasksinvolving general income redistribution shouldbe financed from taxes.
17Strengthening the
equivalence between social contributions andthe corresponding benefits for the contribu-tor would improve the transparency of gov-ernment payments and ensure that generalgovernment activities are financed appropri-

52ately, ie not just by employees subject to so-
cial contributions but by the broader group of
all tax payers. If such government activities
and the associated expenditure or tax grants
were clearly reported, this would also make it
much easier to regularly review their necessity
and facilitate the associated fiscal policy dis-
cussions. Furthermore, it would make it far
harder to shift tasks and burdens back and
forth in an opaque and unsystematic manner,
as has been the case in the past. At the same
time, contributions would be perceived less
as a tax and more as the price to be paid for
purchasing (insurance) benefits, and the dis-
tortions of the present tax and social contri-
butions system could diminish overall.
Concluding remarks
In the last two years, tax revenue developed
extremely dynamically. This is due in no small
measure to the revenue-boosting measures
that were resolved in the context of a tight
budgetary situation. In addition, proceeds
from profit-related taxes soared, irrespective
of legislative changes, and by far exceeded
the estimates. Although this was, in part, a
counterswing from the sluggish revenue dy-
namics after 2001, this revenue is now likely
to be above the medium-term trend level.
The sharp growth in revenue, the achieve-
ment last year of a close-to-balance general
government budget and the macroeconomic
slowdown – owing in part to the crisis on the
financial markets – have triggered a public
debate about tax cuts. Curbing the tax bur-
den and ensuring an efficient tax and socialcontributions system are indeed key compon-
ents of an institutional economic environ-
ment that is conducive to growth. However,
given considerable uncertainty regarding the
structural revenue level and foreseeable
budgetary strains, a prudent approach that is
consistent with the aim of achieving structur-
ally balanced budgets appears appropriate. It
is important to bear in mind that, in the end,
expenditure has to be covered by revenue
and that, ultimately, borrowing simply shifts
the burden along the time axis – to the detri-
ment of future generations. Thus, cuts in
taxes and social contributions require sound
counterfinancing. A key objective as part of
the second stage of the federalism reform II is
therefore the tightening of the budgetary
rules so as to take better account of this
underlying relationship. In view of the partly
erratic evolution of tax revenue, it is import-
ant to systematically incorporate the associ-
ated forecasting uncertainties in the new
budgetary rules. This could also better ac-
commodate the stabilising function of gov-
ernment budgets over the economic cycle.
In general, policymakers should avoid pursu-
ing a short-term fiscal policy oriented to the
cash balance situation and should aim at
making structural improvements in the field
of tax policy. While the marked lowering of
tax rates since 2001 has improved the under-
lying economic conditions, no progress has
been made, for example, towards greater fi-
nancing neutrality in the area of business tax-
ation, and the transparency of the tax system
has not improved on the whole. Furthermore,
the tax burden is automatically increasing
owing to income tax progression. Therefore,Uncertainty

53and also because international competition
for tax bases is likely to continue, fundamen-
tal reforms will remain on the political
agenda. These could include lower tax rates
and a curbing of special tax provisions, a co-herent tax system as well as a transparent
financing of non-insurance-related benefits
currently provided by the social security
funds.
Annex
Major tax policy measures since the end of
200218
Second Act Promoting Modern Labour Market
Services ( Zweites Gesetz f/C252r moderne Dienst-
leistungen am Arbeitsmarkt ) (23 December
2002)
This Act revised the terms and conditions for low-
paid part-time workers (“mini-jobs”) as of 2003. It
introduced uniform flat-rate tax and social security
levies (flat-rate tax of 2% and flat-rate social secur-
ity contributions) for employees with a monthly
salary of no more than 3400. It also implemented
income tax relief for expenditure on employment
and services in households.
Act Continuing the Ecological Tax Reform
(Gesetz zur Fortentwicklung der /C246kologischen
Steuerreform ) (23 December 2002)
This Act raised the energy tax rates – above all
on natural gas – and curtailed the benefits granted
to the production and agricultural sectors as of
2003. The additional energy tax revenue gener-
ated through the “ecological tax reform” was ear-
marked to expand the Federal grants to the statu-
tory pension insurance scheme.19Act to Reduce Tax Privileges and Exemptions –
the Tax Privilege Reduction Act ( Gesetz zum
Abbau von Steuerverg/C252nstigungen und Aus-
nahmeregelungen – Steuerverg/C252nstigungs-
abbaugesetz ) (16 May 2003)
This Act involved, above all, a three-year morator-
ium (12 April 2003 to 31 December 2005) on off-
setting any corporation tax credits originating from
the imputation method applicable until 2000, as
well as the abolition of the legal institution of the
multiple-parent fiscal unit with retroactive effect
from the beginning of 2003.
Second Act Amending Tax Provisions – the
2003 Tax Amendment Act ( Zweites Gesetz zur
/C190nderung steuerlicher Vorschriften – Steuer-
/C228nderungsgesetz 2003 ) (15 December 2003)
Among other things, this Act introduced measures
to combat turnover tax fraud, to simplify the tax
system and to reduce bureaucracy with effect from
2004 onwards.

and the Act Amending the Local Business Tax
Act and Other Acts ( Gesetz zur /C190nderung des
Gewerbesteuergesetzes und anderer Gesetze )
(23 December 2003)
These Acts introduced various measures with the
intention, above all, of stabilising corporation tax
revenue, in particular limiting the tax loss carry-
forward facility to 60% of total income for losses
in excess of 31 million and implementing adjust-
ments with regard to shareholder loans with
effect from 2004 onwards. They also implemented
analogous modifications to local business tax and
relief for local governments through a reduction in
the share of local business tax transferred to cen-
tral and state government.
Act to Promote Tax Honesty ( Gesetz zur
F/C246rderung der Steuerehrlichkeit ) (23 Decem-
ber 2003)
This Act provided an exemption from prosecution
and fines for tax evasion between 1993 and the
end of 2002 through submission of an income
declaration and payment of a flat-rate levy of 25%
up to the end of 2004 or 35% in the first quarter
of 2005 (tax amnesty).20Act Amending the Tobacco Tax Act and Other
Excise Duty Acts ( Gesetz zur /C190nderung des
Tabaksteuergesetzes und anderer Verbrauch-
steuergesetze ) (23 December 2003)
This Act involved a three-stage increase in tobacco
tax: in March 2004, December 2004 and Septem-
ber 2005 (for cigarettes, this meant an increase of
around 1.2 cents per cigarette each time). The
additional revenue was earmarked to finance the
Federal grant to the statutory health insurance
scheme which was paid for the first time in
2004.21
Act Accompanying the 2004 Budget ( Haus-
haltsbegleitgesetz 2004 ) (29 December 2003)
This Act brought forward part of the third tax relief
stage of the 2000 income tax reform from 2005 to
2004 (the bottom rate was cut from 19.9% to
16%, the top rate was cut from 48.5% to 45%,
the basic tax allowance was raised and the upper
proportional zone was lowered). The Act also
introduced various measures to eliminate tax sub-
sidies, to aid budget consolidation and to combat
turnover tax fraud with effect from 2004 onwards
(these included, in particular, a reduction in the
grant to homebuyers, modifications to the depreci-
ation rules for movable assets and a cut in the
commuting allowance).
20The estimated revenue from this measure was put at
35 billion in the draft legislation. In reality, however, only
31.4 billion was generated.

Act on the Tax Promotion of Growth and
Employment ( Gesetz zur steuerlichen
F/C246rderung von Wachstum und Besch/C228ftigung )
(26 April 2006)
This Act implemented various measures to pro-
mote economic growth from 2006 onwards: thedeclining-balance depreciation rate for movableassets was raised from 20% to 30% per year in2006 and 2007, the income tax relief for expend-iture on household services was extended (in par-ticular to include the services of specific skilledtrades) and actual taxation was expanded in thecase of turnover tax.

(Haushaltsbegleitgesetz 2006 ) (29 June 2006)
This Act raised the standard rates of turnover tax
and insurance tax by 3 percentage points to 19%
as well as the lump-sum input tax for agriculture
and forestry with effect from 2007 onwards. One-
third of the additional revenue arising from the in-
crease in turnover tax was earmarked (as part of a
fundamental revision of the financial relations be-
tween central government and the Federal Em-
ployment Agency) to finance a rule-based Federal
grant to the Federal Employment Agency.23
2005 Investment Grant Act ( Investitions-
zulagengesetz 2005 ) (17 March 2004), 2007
Investment Grant Act ( Investitionszulagen-
gesetz 2007 ) (15 July 2006)
These Acts laid down that the assistance granted
by the 1999 Investment Grant Act ( Investitionszu-
lagengesetz 1999 ) – which expired at the end of
2004 – would be continued up to the end of
2009, albeit with a reduced scope of assistance.24
2007 Tax Amendment Act ( Steuer/C228nderungs-
gesetz 2007 ) (19 July 2006)
This Act implemented various measures to aid
budget consolidation as of 2007. Above all, it laid
down that the commuting allowance would be
granted only from the 21st kilometre onwards
(travel expenses for journeys between home and
work would, in principle, no longer be deemed to
be income-related expenses), the savers’ tax allow-
ance was cut (from 31,370 to 3750 for unmarried
persons), the maximum age of a child qualifying
for child benefit was lowered and the rate of in-
come tax for annual income in excess of 3250,000
in the case of unmarried persons or 3500,000 inthe case of married persons was raised to 45%
(excluding income from profits up to the end of
2007).
Act on the Creation of German Real Estate
Investment Trusts with Listed Shares – the REIT
Act (Gesetz zur Schaffung deutscher
Immobilien-Aktiengesellschaften mit b/C246rsen-
notierten Anteilen – REIT-Gesetz ) (28 May
2007)
This Act created a new instrument for indirect in-
vestment in real estate in the form of the German
real estate investment trust (REIT), ie a special kind
of listed public limited company, which fulfils cer-
tain conditions (especially with regard to the free
float of the company’s shares and minimum divi-
dend payments) and is itself not subject to tax-
ation. The Act promoted the sale of commercial
real estate to REITs through exempting half of the
sales proceeds from income tax for a limited period
from 2007 to 2009.
2008 Business Tax Reform Act ( Unternehmen-
steuerreformgesetz 2008 ) (14 August 2007)
This Act lowered tax rates for enterprises and was
counterfinanced by various measures to broaden
the tax assessment bases from 2008 onwards. The
Act included the following.
– The corporation tax rate was cut by 10 per-
centage points to 15%.
– A retention reserve was introduced for non-
corporations with a nominal tax rate of around
30%.

– Declining-balance depreciation for movable
assets was abolished, the debt interest deduct-ible was limited by means of an “interest de-duction ceiling” and revised arrangementswere implemented with regard to shell pur-chases, securities lending and the determin-ation of intercompany transfer prices in thecase of a relocation of functions.This Act also introduced a withholding tax of 25%
for private investment income (such as interest,dividend payments or capital gains from the sale ofsecurities) from 2009 onwards, with an assessmentoption and a blanket deduction for income-relatedexpenses (new savers’ tax allowance of 3801 for

59Financing
constraints and
capital accumulation:
microeconometric
evidenceFinancing constraints can potentially
hamper corporate investment activity.
The importance of this relationship is
tested using two very different data
sets: a qualitative UK study of firms
and the ifo Investment Survey.
The results show that financially con-
strained firms are slower to adjust
their capital stock upwards than are
financially unconstrained firms. This
adjustment delay is particularly evi-
dent in the case of small firms. How-
ever, small firms are, by nature, more
flexible than large firms. On the basis
of the microeconometric estimates, it
is possible to construct an indicator of
the sensitivity of investment demand
as a function of the severity of the
financial constraints.
The results presented in this article, as
well as the fact that there has been a
continuous substantial improvement in
balance sheet structures for many
years, appear to indicate that German
firms’ investment activity during the
current business cycle up until the end
of the observation period (late autumn
2007) was not exposed to any mean-
ingful external finance constraints.
The importance of financing constraints
There are various ways in which firms can be
financially constrained. External financing
costs may be high enough to prevent the im-Types of

60plementation of projects that might have
paid off had sufficient internal finance been
available. Financing constraints may also take
the form of quantitative restrictions (credit ra-
tioning) if borrowing in excess of a certain
limit is not permitted. Lastly, lending may also
be attached to the fulfilment of further condi-
tions, such as the maturity of liabilities or
how the funds are being used.
The default risk of the borrower is not per se
the cause of the external finance premium.
The agreed interest rate contains a default
premium even in perfect markets. The real
world, however, is characterised by imperfect
markets with transaction costs and informa-
tion asymmetry. The lender also needs to be
compensated for the expected added costs of
financing the project externally rather than
internally. These are caused by the costs of
obtaining and processing information as well
as of monitoring, assessing and collecting the
debt.
Constraints on external debt or equity finance
are, by their very nature, a market-driven
response by responsible agents to the imper-
fections of the financial markets. The dotcom
bubble in the Neuer Markt at the start of the
new millennium was a particularly striking ex-
ample of what can happen when these
mechanisms fail – equity was all too often
provided without sound knowledge of the
projects being financed, without adequate
safety nets to protect against bad entrepre-
neurial decisions and without taking into ac-
count the incentives being given to decision-
makers. Capital misallocation on a grand
scale was the result.The ability of real-world financial systems to
deal with information problems has obvious
implications for allocative efficiency and
growth. On the heels of the seminal paper by
Rajan and Zingales,1the state of financial de-
velopment of a given country was identified
as one of the major sectoral and macroeco-
nomic determinants of growth, especially in
terms of the growth outlook for economies in
transition and how they are integrated into
the system of the international division of la-
bour.
Financing constraints are also a factor in the
monetary transmission process. Monetary
policy measures can impact on potential bor-
rowers’ ability to borrow and also alter the
banking industry’s ability to lend.2In a very
general sense, the financing constraints faced
by firms are a key reason why there is any re-
lationship at all between the financial health
of a firm, its total value and its activity in the
real sector.3

61Problems of measurement and
operationalisation
For a long time, the approach developed by
Fazzari, Hubbard and Petersen was used to
identify and measure financing constraints in
quantitatively oriented economic research.4
The underlying idea may be illustrated as fol-
lows: the financing constraints faced by
school-leavers can be tested by determining
whether or not the decision to attend univer-
sity and the financial wealth of the parents
are correlated. If all the success factors of a
four-year degree are controlled for, there
should be no such correlation in the absence
of financing constraints. Accordingly, the
cash flow sensitivity of corporate investment
can be used to identify financing constraints
for firms. Without any external finance pre-
mium or credit rationing, current cash flow
should have no explanatory power, provided
all aspects of investment projects which actu-
ally determine the value can be adequately
accounted for.
In the past few years, however, this approach
has come under heavy criticism.5The criteria
for dividing firms into financially constrained
and financially unconstrained groups proved
to be spurious and not robust to generalisa-
tion. The sensitivity itself is virtually impossible
to interpret under real-world conditions. A
monotone relationship between this sensitiv-
ity and the degree of financing constraints
exists neither theoretically nor empirically. If,
therefore, a comparison is made between
more constrained and less constrained firms
instead of conceptually selecting the absence
of any financing constraint as a referencepoint, it is not clear which group can be ex-
pected to be more sensitive. An additional
fundamental problem is that cash flow is cal-
culated empirically as the sum of the firm’s
profit and depreciations. Profit, however, is
the target variable for the entire range of
entrepreneurial activities. Current profits and
investment, the latter being the key instru-
ment of corporate policy, are correlated for a
multitude of reasons that have nothing to do
with financing constraints. This remains true
even if due account is taken of the fact that
investment at a given point in time largely
has no impact on output during the same
period. Expectation formation, the time
needed to develop and implement major pro-
jects and the persistence of productivity
shocks all play a key role, as well as learning
effects and the length of market penetration
periods.
Direct observation using surveys of firms
The problems involved in breaking firms
down into constrained and unconstrained
firms, and the difficulties in interpreting the
cash flow sensitivity, can be avoided by ob-

62serving financing constraints directly. Data
from surveys of firms, in which firms report
anonymously on their plans and their assess-
ment of the situation, the current trends in
their sales and other business figures, are a
useful tool for this purpose. Some surveys
also contain information on financing condi-
tions and constraints.
The survey data can be validated and evalu-
ated by measuring the speed at which firms
respond to new investment projects that hold
out the promise of profit.6Financially uncon-
strained firms are able to react immediately,
or at least very rapidly, to new opportunities.
By contrast, financially constrained firms do
not instantaneously succeed in reaching the
long-run optimum, but instead take time to
adjust. In some cases, only part of the neces-
sary fixed capital can be purchased using
debt, whereas further investment has to be
conducted with retained earnings from sales
while, at the same time, the balance sheet is
being repaired. The difference in the speed of
adjustment is the statistical “fingerprint” of
financing constraints and helps to identify
their impact econometrically. It is a measure
that can represent the core of the economic
importance of such constraints.
This approach was first tested using qualita-
tive survey data from the United Kingdom.7
The test was based on the Industrial Trends
Survey (ITS) conducted by the Confederation
of British Industry (CBI), which plays a key
role in business cycle analysis in the United
Kingdom. The cleaned panel contains 49,244
observations on 5,196 firms over 11 years of
data from January 1989 to October 1999.The CBI claims that ITS represents around
33% of total current employment in the UK
manufacturing sector. The panel covers all
size categories; however, small firms, on
which little information is otherwise available
in the UK, are particularly well represented.
More than 63% of observations in the sam-
ple relate to firms having fewer than 200 em-
ployees. On average, around 20.8% of those
surveyed indicate that their firms were con-
strained by the lack of either internal or exter-
nal finance and that these constraints had a
real impact on investment behaviour. The
study focuses on capacity adjustments. Firms
report whether their capacity is insufficient
relative to demand. Following the ideas out-
lined above, one would expect firms report-
ing financial constraints to experience cap-
acity shortfalls more frequently than others
and for these gaps to require more time to
close.
A proportional hazard model is estimated in
order to measure the speed of adjustment. Fi-
nancially constrained firms take longer to
complete a spell of restricted capacity. Ac-
cording to the results of the study, the meas-
ured difference in duration is marked but not
significant. At any given time, financially con-
strained firms will leave the state of capacity
restrictions at a rate that is around 20%
lower than that of firms not reporting finan-
cial constraints.

63A breakdown of the sample shows that the
relationship is less significant for large firmsthan for small firms. This could indicate thatfinancial constraints are less important for theactivity of large firms. However, it is interest-ing to observe that small firms overcome theircapacity shortfalls more quickly than largefirms – on average and conditional on their fi-nancial status. This may mean that, with theirflat hierarchies and low coordination costs,small firms are more nimble and flexible indealing with demand shocks than large firms.
Studying the adjustment behaviour of UK
firms relies on qualitative information; thismeans that the survey can only state whetheror not a firm suffered capacity restrictions.Nothing is said about the extent of restric-tions. This provides leeway for interpretingthe results cited above. Another reason whyfinancially constrained firms take a longertime to adjust is that firms with a large invest-ment demand encounter financing con-straints more frequently than firms with asmaller demand for finance. The two possibledirections of causation can be distinguishedonly if quantitative information about theneed for adjustment is either available or canbe constructed.
The ifo Institute’s Investment Survey provides
high-quality quantitative information on in-vestment volume, employment and sales,covering multiple consecutive years. The in-formation is sufficient to reconstruct meas-ures of firms’ real capital stock and to esti-mate a partial adjustment model for the cap-ital stock in which the speed of adjustment ismeasured as the strength of the reaction to agap between the target capital stock and in-
stalled capital. The size of the adjustment re-quirement can thus be explicitly included.
8
Also, the dataset contains information onhow various factors affect investment behav-iour, including financing conditions.
The micro data from the Ifo Investment Sur-
vey in Western German Manufacturing for1988 to 1998 were available for sampling.During this 11-year period, the autumn sur-vey, which contains information on financialconstraints, contained 25,643 observationson a total of 4,443 firms with an average of2,331 observations per year.
The advantage of this dataset, like the UK
data, lies not only in its size and representa-tiveness but also in containing a large numberof relatively small firms. Nearly half of the ob-servations refer to firms with fewer than 200employees, and 20% of the firms have fewerthan 50 employees. Around one-quarter ofthe surveyed firms indicated that their invest-ment was constrained by the availability orcost of finance. To some extent, theseresponses could also be due to variations inthe general level of lending rates. Such aggre-gated effects can be taken account of, andthus filtered out of the estimation equationby including time dummies indicating theyear. Thus, it is only deviations of firm-leveldata from the sectoral average which arerelevant for identification (see also the ex-planatory notes on page 64).

64Adjustment with regime-dependent speed and partly unobserved targets
The starting point is a static neoclassical equa-
tion for factor demand. With a CES production
function, the first-order conditions for the static
maximum profit result in the following linear
relationship for the capital stock:
log K/C3¼log Y/C3/C0/C27 log UC/C3þlog h/C3. (1)
Here, Kis capital, Yreal output, UCthe user
cost of capital, /C27stands for the elasticity of sub-
stitution, and hfor a variable that is dependent
on firm-specific technology parameters. The
asterisk denotes a long-term equilibrium value.
To describe the adjustment dynamics, it is neces-
sary to model the unobservable target variable
econometrically. Following the error component
approach for panel data, one may assume that
the unobservable variable can be approximated
by observable variables, augmented by error
terms that either assume the same value for all
individuals at a given point in time or are con-
stant for a given individual. The desired capital
stock of enterprise iat time tis modelled as
follows:
log K/C3
i;t¼log S i;tþ/C21tþ/C22i. (2)
In this case, the logarithm of real sales, log S i;t,i s
a proxy for the evolution of real output over
time. In addition, it is also possible to use indi-
cators for the expected sales development. The
time effect /C21tcaptures the effects of changes in
the user cost of capital and other macroeco-
nomic effects which apply to all enterprises
alike, including total factor productivities which
are variable in time. The fixed effect /C22irepre-
sents unobservable firm-specific technological
determinants of capital intensity. It is now as-
sumed that the speed with which the real capital
stock is adjusted varies with the financing condi-
tions:/C1log K i;t¼/C0/C30ðri;t/C01Þðlog K i;t/C01/C0K/C3

cause they interact with the time-variable

The transformed equation looks more compli-
cated than the original, but has the advantage
that the unobservable error term /C22iis eliminated
and GMM estimations become possible for the a
coefficients. However, the non-linearity of equa-
tion (5) has to be taken into account in an
appropriate manner.1
1Such transformations are called “quasi-differences”. The
term was coined by D Holtz-Eakin, W Newey and H S Rosen
(1988), Estimating Vector Autoregressions with Panel Data,
Econometrica, Vol 56, pp 1371–1395. The transformation
developed by Holtz-Eakin et al deals with a different case,
however. For the technique described here, see U vonKalckreuth, Panel estimation of state dependent adjust-
ment when the target is unobserved, Deutsche Bundes-
bank Research Centre, Discussion Paper, Series 1, Economic
Studies, No 09/2008. This paper also analyses other estima-
tion methods and compares them in a simulation study.

65The preferred estimate featured a distinction
between three different adjustment regimes.The first regime is for stationary or expandingfirms that are not financially constrained. Thesecond regime covers stationary or expandingfirms which report financing constraints, andthe third is for potentially downsizing firms.For such firms, financial constraints do not, infact, necessarily lead to a slower adjustmentspeed because the adjustment does not re-quire the purchase of new capital goods. Ex-pansion is modelled on the basis of sales ex-pectations. Owing to potential endogeneity,lagged expectations of the impact of financialconstraints and sales patterns are used to de-fine the adjustment regime.
A comparison is made between the adjust-
ment speeds of stationary or expanding firmsthat are either financially constrained or fi-nancially unconstrained. The adjustmentspeed is defined as the fraction of the gap be-tween the (logarithmic) values of the currentand the target capital stock that is removedwithin a year. The estimates show that finan-cial constraints do, in fact, reduce the adjust-ment speed. As in the study of UK firms, theeffect is concentrated on smaller firms where,once again, the adjustment speed is generallyhigher than in the case of large firms. Forsmall, financially unconstrained firms, the ad-justment speed per year is measured at a rateof 0.243. If the firms are constrained, the ratedecreases markedly to 0.166. For uncon-strained large firms, the adjustment speed is0.186, with the speed falling only marginallyto 0.165 for constrained firms.

66German firms’ financing situation
In the investment survey which yielded the
micro data on which the above-described
study is based, west German firms are sur-
veyed once a year, in autumn, on the deter-
minants of their investment behaviour,
among other factors. The firms are asked to
assess the impact of the following factors on
a five-part scale: sales conditions/expect-
ations, availability/costs of finance, earnings
expectations, technological development,
basic economic policy conditions and other
factors. This assessment is made for both the
current and the following year. The informa-
tion is disaggregated by size category for the
first time here.In its upper half, the chart on this page initially
shows the significance of the availability of fi-
nance for investment behaviour in a compari-
son with the key factors of sales expectations
and earnings expectations across all size cat-
egories. The weighted balances of percent-
age points of positive and negative assess-
ments are given, with the weight of “stimu-
lating” and “limiting” answer categories
each being halved. In terms of the strength of
the fluctuation, availability of finance is less
important for explaining investment behav-
iour than the other two factors. The microe-
conometric analysis also bears out this assess-
ment.10However, sales expectations and
earnings expectations are highly correlated,
whereas the information provided by the
“availability of finance” factor is partly inde-
pendent.
A look at the availability of finance by size
category shows a rather pronounced co-
movement. Despite the overall low level of
interest rates, firms found it particularly diffi-
cult to obtain finance for their projects in the
period after 2002. The situation has been im-
proving again since 2005. It is interesting to
note, however, that the volatility is stronger
among the smallest firms than among firms
with over 1,000 employees. This points to
size-specific differences in the importance of
financing constraints. When interpreting
them, it should again be noted that the credit
risk associated with loans to firms fluctuates
over the business cycle. The possibility thatAverage adjustment speed, weighted average 1

67these fluctuations are stronger for smaller
firms cannot be ruled out.11
According to the assessment by firms in thewest German manufacturing sector, the avail-ability of finance was above average at theend of the data horizon in autumn 2007. Theaggregate balance of positive and negativeanswers is only slightly below the previousyear’s peak. Even this slight decline is limitedto large firms with 200 and more employees.If, instead of the assessment of the currentyear, one looks at the outlook for the forth-coming period, the assessment becomessomewhat gloomier at the current end,which also includes smaller firms. However,the assessment of the availability of financeremained at an above-average level.
The microeconomic estimates enable the sur-
vey data to be converted for analytical pur-poses into a sensitivity of the aggregate topositive investment opportunities. Financiallyconstrained firms are slower to act on theirinvestment opportunities. For these firms, thenumber of such new opportunities that canactually be realised is smaller. The aggregatedadjustment speeds indicate the extent towhich the availability of finance enables firmsto respond quickly to growth opportunities.
The time series of estimated aggregate ad-
justment speeds clearly shows the recessionthat followed the end of the “reunificationboom” of the early 1990s and the slump thatfollowed the bursting of the New Economybubble at the beginning of the new millen-nium. During the mid- to late 1990s, how-ever, firms were especially well able to re-spond quickly to new opportunities. The
chart on this page shows that, up until theend of 2007, the finances available to firmsstill provided good growth opportunities des-pite weakening slightly, with the aggregateadjustment speed fluctuating between 0.195and 0.202 during the observation period.As a percentage of fixed assets

68Among small firms, the average adjustment
speed varied between 0.256 and 0.267. The
effect of changes in the availability of finance
was therefore more pronounced than for
large firms, whose estimated adjustment
speed, as a function of the availability of fi-
nance, fluctuated only between 0.176 and
0.180.
German firms’ finances are currently in sound
condition, which reflects increased restructur-
ing efforts and higher profitability. The chart
on page 67 shows that firms’ equity has been
rising markedly and that their liquidity cush-ion has also seen strong growth. At the same
time, the importance of short and long-term
bank loans for corporate finance has been on
a pronounced slide. On the whole, Germany’s
non-financial corporate sector has sound fi-
nancing structures, which reduces depend-
ency on external capital and yet, at the same
time, makes it easier for banks to grant loans.
It is precisely in those cases where the finan-
cial markets encounter rough patches that
the soundness of capital structures in the
non-financial corporate sector benefits the
economy as a whole.Firms’ finances
