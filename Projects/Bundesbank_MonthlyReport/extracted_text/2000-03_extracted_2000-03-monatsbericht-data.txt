5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Economy as a wholeOverall output in Germany again rose sharply
in the fourth quarter of 1999. Adjusted forseasonal and working-day fluctuations, itgrew by around
34% compared with the
summer months; after adjustment for vari-ations in the number of working days, grossdomestic product was 2.3% up on the com-parable level for 1998. Manufacturing wasthe major factor underpinning growth, withfurther stimuli being supplied by exports.However, enterprise service suppliers and fi-nancing institutions, too, were again able tomake a significant increase to their valueadded.
ManufacturingThe start to the year was rather subdued in
manufacturing. Seasonally adjusted orders re-ceived in January did not exceed the level ofDecember 1999; compared with the fourthquarter as a whole, there was a decline of1
34%. The year-on-year rise slowed to
734%, having been 1012% in autumn.
Domestic orders, in particular, suffered a
slowdown in growth. Compared with thefourth quarter – which had, admittedly, beenparticularly favourable owing to special fac-tors – they fell by around 2
12% in seasonally
adjusted terms. Although orders were stillslightly more than 3% above their level ayear before, the rate of increase in autumnhad been around 7
14%. Orders of durable
consumer goods suffered an above-averageGDP in Q4

6sharp decline, the main reason being house-
holds’ much lower demand for new cars.
Seasonally adjusted foreign orders were al-
most 1% lower at the beginning of the yearthan in the last few months of 1999. How-ever, at a growth rate of around 14
12%, they
continued to be well up on last year’s level.This also applies to the capital goods sector,which again received a number of majororders.
In January, seasonally adjusted manufacturing
output was just over 1% up on the monthand 1% higher than in the last quarter of1999 as a whole. It was thus 5
14% higher
than a year previously, compared with 4% inautumn 1999. However, these figures are stillprovisional and are likely to be revised in sev-eral respects. Firstly, the monthly figures haveto be adjusted to the more comprehensivequarterly data. This has already been initiatedby the Federal Statistical Office, insofar as ad-justments have been made on the same scaleas previous revisions. It is possible, however,that the actual figures will be subject to fur-ther changes, although it is not possible to es-timate their direction or scale at present. Sec-ondly, a further adjustment is to be expectedfor January 2000 when the enterprises whichhave not responded so far, and have beenshown in the statistics with the previousmonth’s figures, submit their reports. Experi-ence has shown that there tends to be adownward revision of the final figures at thebeginning of a year. It is likely that the growthin output will then be smaller than that cur-rently reported.Economic conditions in Germany*

7Construction
The situation in the construction sector
continued to be subdued at the turn of1999–2000 as well. Even though seasonallyadjusted orders received by the constructionindustry in December were somewhat higherthan before, on the average of the autumnmonths as a whole they were around 6%below their level of the third quarter. Theywere 6% down on the year, compared with–3
12% in the preceding three-month
period.
Orders declined not only in housing construc-
tion, which had already been displayingweakness again for some time, but also incommercial construction. Public sector con-struction was best able to hold its own. How-ever, the surge in orders towards the end ofthe year did not completely offset the slow-down in the previous months.
Seasonally adjusted construction output in
January – preliminary data are already avail-able up to that month – remained at the levelreached in the fourth quarter. Although itwas still around 6
12% down on last year’s
level, this was mainly due to the fact that thevery mild weather conditions twelve monthspreviously had had very little impact on out-put.
Labour marketThe labour market continued to develop fa-
vourably. According to the preliminary esti-mates of the Federal Statistical Office, theseasonally adjusted number of employed per-sons rose to 36.1 million in December 1999.
This corresponds to an increase of almost50,000 compared with the last trough of Sep-tember 1999. The year-on-year fall, whichhad been as much as 80,000 in October,shrank to 20,000.
At the same time, there was a noticeable fall
in unemployment. For February, the FederalLabour Office reported 3.92 million un-employed, seasonally adjusted. This was70,000 fewer than at the end of 1999 and al-most 190,000 persons fewer than a year ago.The unemployment rate in the overall civilianlabour force reached 10.0%, compared with10.4% in the fourth quarter. It was not justthe old Länder which registered a decline (to8.2% at the end of the period under review);in eastern Germany, too, the rate fell from18.0% in autumn to 17.4%.
PricesThe rise in prices has distinctly accelerated
over the past few months. The year-on-yearrate of consumer price increase is likely tohave risen to 1.8% in February – the final fig-ures are not yet available – compared with1.6% in January and 1.2% at the end of1999. Seasonal food, which became muchmore expensive than is usual at this time ofthe year as a result of the onset of cold winterweather, is likely to have contributed stronglyto the latest increase. In the case of energy,the cold winter weather and the high inter-national oil prices resulted in a further rise inthe price of heating oil.Orders received

8Under the impact of the upward trend in oil
prices and the depreciation of the euroagainst the US dollar, imported raw materialsund pre-fabricated products were becomingmuch more expensive up to the end of theperiod under review. By contrast, movementsin prices of finished products remained com-paratively moderate. Overall import prices inJanuary were more than 9% higher than atthe start of 1999.
Domestic industrial producer prices also
present a mixed picture. All in all, the year-on-year rate of increase was 2.0% in January.However, prices of capital goods producersexceeded the comparable level of 1999 by nomore than 0.3%, and industrial consumerprices at the end of the period under reviewwere still 0.4% lower than a year before.
Public finance
Federal cash trendsIn the first two months of this year, the Fed-
eral cash deficit totalled 312 billion, com-
pared with 314 billion during the same
period in 1999. While cash receipts decreasedby 2
12%, the decline in cash expenditure, at
512%, was even more pronounced. How-
ever, the cash balance has a very limited indi-cative value, especially at the beginning ofthe year, owing to the sizeable fluctuations inpayment flows in the course of the year.Federal finance on a cash basis*

9Public sector borrowing
In 1999 as a whole the central, regional and
local authorities’ debt increased by 335 bil-
lion, pushing up the cumulative debt totalto31,200 billion by the end of last year.
According to the Maastricht definition
1, the
debt/GDP ratio notified to the EuropeanCommission in late February in the context ofits monitoring of the budgetary situation was61.1%. Following the slight upward revisionof GDP for 1999 in a new Federal StatisticalOffice calculation of early March, the debtratio diminished marginally to 61.0%. How-ever, it is still above the 60% reference value,and it even exceeded the corresponding 1998figure by 0.3 percentage point. This rise wasdue to two main factors: the small growth ofGDP and a relatively substantial formation ofreserves by the public sector. For example, thelarge surplus generated by the statutory pen-sion insurance scheme was used to replenishthe fluctuation reserves and thus was unavail-able for the redemption of debt.
In January the central, regional and local au-
thorities expanded their debt by the relativelylarge margin of almost 37
12billion. This
trend is exclusively attributable to the FederalGovernment, whose overall debt increasedby over 38
12billion. The Federal Govern-
ment obtained slightly more than 34 billion
in the capital markets, the focus being onlong-term maturities. Thus it sold Federalbonds (Bunds) to the tune of almost 38 bil-
lion net, whereas on balance it redeemedmainly five-year special Federal bonds (Bobls)
but also loans against borrowers’ notes andFederal savings bonds. In addition, the Fed-eral Government tapped the money market
for almost 34
12billion. By contrast, the Län-
der Governments cut their net debt by 3112
billion, redeeming short-term bridging loans
from banks and loans against borrowers’notes to the tune of approximately 3
34bil-
lion for each item. Changes in the balances ofthe Redemption Fund for Inherited Liabilities,the Federal Railways Fund and the Equalisa-tion Fund for Safeguarding the Use of Coalare now incorporated into the Federal budgetfigures following the Federal Government’sassumption of joint responsibility for the debtof these special funds. The total indebtednessof the other special funds increased slightly.The local authorities, too, are likely to haveNet borrowing in the market

ary.
In February the Federal Government incurred
capital market debt amounting to slightlymore than 34 billion net. Its gross borrowing
came to just over 38 billion, with sales of
Bobls alone yielding almost 35
12billion. This
was offset by redemptions of Bunds and
loans against borrowers’ notes, in particular,to the tune of approximately 32 billion each.
The Federal Government cut its money mar-ket debt by a total of almost 32 billion.
Securities markets
Bond marketSales activity in the German bond market
picked up again in January. Domestic borrow-ers issued bonds to the market value of359.0 billion, compared with 338.1 billion
in December.
2Just over three-quarters of this
amount accrued to bonds denominated ineuro. Net of redemptions and including thechanges in issuers’ holdings of their ownbonds, net sales in January came to 315.1
billion, compared with net redemptions of35.8 billion a month before. In contrast
to previous months, it was predominantlylonger-term paper (with maturities of morethan four years) that was sold in January. For-eign bonds were sold in the domestic marketto the extent of 311.3 billion net. These were
predominantly bonds denominated in euro orDeutsche Mark issued by non-residents ( 39.5
billion). Sales of domestic and foreign bondsyielded a total of 326.5 billion in January;a month earlier the outstanding amount had
declined by 33.1 billion.
In January, almost two-thirds of the domestic
bonds were issued by credit institutions ( 39.6
billion). Among these, bonds issued by spe-cialised credit institutions and communalbonds (Öffentliche Pfandbriefe) were at the
forefront at 35.5 billion and 33.9 billion, re-
spectively. Other bank bonds were sold to thetune of 31.0 billion. The outstanding amount
of mortgage bonds (Hypothekenpfandbriefe)
declined by 30.9 billion.
In January, the public sector issued bonds
worth 35.5 billion (net). The Federal Govern-
ment received 35.4 billion and sold ten-year
and 30-year Federal bonds amounting to34.6 billion and 33.7 billion net, respectively.
On balance, two-year Federal Treasury noteswere sold to the extent of 30.3 billion. The
outstanding amount of Federal savings bondsand five-year special Federal bonds declinedby30.8 billion and 32.1 billion, respectively.

The Länder Governments’ bonded debt rose
by30.4 billion.
Gross sales of Deutsche Mark/euro bonds is-
sued by non-residents under the lead man-agement of a German syndicate came to 34.6
billion in January, compared with 31.0 billion
in the previous month. Owing to high re-

11demptions, however, the outstanding amount
of such paper declined by 31.6 billion.
On the buyers’ side of the bond market, do-
mestic non-banks and domestic credit institu-tions had recourse to the market to almostthe same extent in January; they increasedtheir bond portfolios by 317.1 billion and
317.0 billion, respectively. They purchased
predominantly domestic bonds ( 310.8 billion
and 311.9 billion, respectively). Foreign in-
vestors reduced their holdings of Germanbonds by 37.6 billion. In December 1999,
they had purchased bonds amounting to36.7 billion.
Equity marketIssuing activity in the German equity market
declined in January. Domestic enterprisesplaced new shares to the market value of31.3 billion, and thus on the same scale as in
the preceding month. On balance, foreignequities were sold in Germany to the tune of36.4 billion, consisting almost exclusively of
portfolio investments. In December 1999,sales of foreign equities in the German mar-ket amounted to 344.5 billion. This excep-
tionally high figure was due to the acquisitionof foreign equities in connection with corpor-ate mergers. Overall, the amount raised inthe German equity market came to 37.7 bil-
lion in January, compared with 345.8 billion
in December.
In January, foreign investors added German
shares amounting to 311.9 billion net to
their portfolios. Domestic credit institutionspurchased equities totalling 33.2 billion (net),predominantly consisting of domestic paper
(32.6 billion). Domestic non-banks’ share
portfolios, however, declined by 37.4 billion.
This was on account of shifts from domestic(–313.2 billion) to foreign ( 35.8 billion)
paper.
Investment fund certificatesThe amount raised by domestic investment
funds was smaller in January (at 314.3 bil-
lion) than a month earlier ( 317.1 billion). The
main reason for this was the sharp decline inthe case of specialised funds, which sold cer-tificates to the extent of 37.7 billion (net),
compared with 316.2 billion in December
1999. Large inflows of funds were recordedby the funds open to the general public,which sold certificates totalling 36.5 billion inSales and purchases of bonds

12January, compared with 30.9 billion a month
before. In the case of specialised funds,mixed funds were the main object of invest-ors’ interest ( 35.4 billion). Bond-based funds
and share-based funds received 31.3 billion
and 30.8 billion, respectively. Open-end real
estate funds sold investment fund certificatesto the amount of 30.1 billion, while the out-
standing amount of money market fund cer-tificates remained unchanged. In the case offunds open to the general public, 35.0 billion
consisted of share-based funds. Money mar-ket funds and mixed funds received 31.8 bil-
lion and 30.5 billion, respectively. Pension in-
vestment mutual funds (Altersvorsorgefonds)
and open-end real estate funds sold certifi-cates totalling 30.1 billion each. Bond-based
funds, however, recorded outflows of fundsto the extent of 31.5 billion. In January, for-
eign bond-based funds sold certificates to thetune of 37.0 billion in the German market,
compared with 32.2 billion in December
1999. The total amount raised by sales of in-vestment fund certificates thus came to321.2 billion in January, compared with
319.3 billion a month earlier.
The investment fund certificates were mainly
bought by domestic non-banks ( 318.7 bil-
lion); roughly two-thirds of their purchasesconsisted of domestic certificates ( 311.3 bil-
lion) and one-third of foreign certificates(37.4 billion). Credit institutions’ holdings of
investment fund certificates increased by30.9 billion. On balance, their purchases con-
sisted solely of domestic fund certificates(31.3 billion). Non-residents purchased cer-
tificates of domestic investment funds to thetune of 31.6 billion.Balance of payments
Germany’s current account – the combined
outcome of foreign trade, services, factor in-come and current transfers – ran a deficit of36.9 billion in January 2000 compared with
one of 34.1 billion in December 1999. How-
ever, the rise in the deficit was no more thanis usual at the beginning of the year.
According to calculations by the Federal Stat-
istical Office, Germany’s foreign trade surplusamounted to 33.6 billion in January 2000
compared with 34.0 billion in December
1999. In seasonally adjusted terms, both ex-ports and imports again increased substan-tially in January whereas in the previousmonth turnover on the export side as well ason the import side had been relatively low. Ifthe figures for December and January aretaken together, exports rose by just over
12%
compared with the previous two-monthperiod; imports grew by 2
12% on a two-
month comparison although the higher im-port prices played a significant role in that.
Mainly for seasonal reasons, the deficit on in-
visible current transactions with non-residentsincreased by 32.2 billion to 310.0 billion in
January. The deficit on factor income, whichis subject to considerable monthly fluctu-ations, rose particularly sharply in Januarywhen it amounted to 34.3 billion compared
with 32.2 billion in the previous month. Ser-
vice transactions with non-residents alsoshowed a somewhat larger deficit for season-al reasons in January ( 34.0 billion compared
with 33.1 billion in December) whereas the

13was below the December 1999 level ( 32.5
billion). This was mainly the result of smallernet payments to the EU budget ( 30.3 billion
compared with 31.2 billion a month earlier).
Portfolio transactions with non-residents re-
sulted in large net outflows of capital in Janu-ary (318.4 billion). This was essentially due to
the continuous purchasing of foreign secur-ities by German investors ( 323.6 billion).
However, the segments on which their inter-est was focused had changed somewhatfrom the previous month. In the period underreview, for example, investment in foreignbonds and notes ( 311.3 billion) – notably
euro-denominated paper – increased sharplywhereas demand for foreign shares weak-ened ( 36.2 billion) and foreign money mar-
ket paper was sold on balance ( 30.9 billion).
At the same time foreign investors’ interest inGerman securities declined ( 35.2 billion com-
pared with 314.0 billion in December). Inter-
national investors’ largest net sales involvedsome of the German money market paperthey had acquired before the turn of the year.These investors also reduced their holdings ofGerman bonds whereas they increased theirinvestment in the German equity market.
There were likewise net capital exports
through direct investment in January 2000(34.0 billion). Transaction volumes returned
to normal after the substantial gross flows inDecember. Foreign proprietors provided theirsubsidiaries domiciled in Germany with in-vestible funds amounting to 31.1 billion
while German enterprises invested 35.0 bil-
lion abroad.Major items of the balance

15Monetary policy
transparencyIn monetary policy, a trend towards
greater transparency has been appar-ent in recent years. This article first ofall sets forth the principal reasons forthis development. It is shown thatthe openness and reconstructability ofmonetary policy decisions are basicallyin the best interests of all parties con-cerned. However, uncertainty aboutthe monetary transmission mechanismsand differences in perception betweencentral bankers and the markets setlimits to the efforts to achieve fulltransparency. The crucial elements ofa transparent monetary policy are: aclear definition of the ultimate goal,the announcement of the monetarypolicy strategy, the publication of thedata relevant to decision-making andthe consistent substantiation of policydecisions. On the other hand, it seemsto make little sense to measure the de-gree of openness and comprehensibil-ity solely in terms of the use of specificmeans of communication, such as thepublication of the minutes of meet-ings. Any verdict on the transparencyof monetary policy should, rather, bebased exclusively on a comprehensiveanalysis of all the relevant criteria.Moreover, on some occasions theremay be an incompatibility betweenthe call for greater clarity and thecriterion of monetary policy efficiencythat must be taken into accountwhen deciding for or against specifictransparency-promoting measures.

16The benefits of transparency
Many central banks have made considerable
efforts in recent years to disclose and explaintheir objectives, their strategy and the back-ground to their interest-rate-policy decisions.This trend owes something, on the one hand,to the need to meet prescribed disclosure re-quirements and, on the other, to the inten-tion of exploiting information channels so asto influence market participants’ expect-ations.
Accountability is, as it were, the consequence
of the greater independence that has beengranted to central banks in many countries.In a democracy, the independence of an ex-ecutive body cannot be seen in isolation fromits mandate. An independent central bankshould therefore have a clearly defined ob-jective and be accountable for its actions. Forthis reason, the Maastricht Treaty providesfor extensive reporting requirements for theEuropean System of Central Banks (ESCB).For example, the European Central Bank is re-quired to submit to the European Parliament,the ECOFIN Council, the EU Commission andthe European Council an annual report onthe activities of the ESCB and on the monet-ary policy pursued in both the previous andthe current year. Moreover, the President ofthe ECB and the other members of the Execu-tive Board may be heard by the European Par-liament and the appropriate committees. Inaddition, the statute of the ESCB and ECBprovides for the publication of quarterly re-ports on their activities.The actual information policy of the Eurosys-
tem is, however, much more comprehensive.For instance, the Governing Council of theECB decided to provide a quantitative defin-ition of the ultimate objective and to an-nounce the benchmarks of its monetary pol-icy strategy. The ECB’s decision to publishMonthly Bulletins and hold regular press con-ferences likewise goes beyond the require-ments of the Maastricht Treaty. Other centralbanks, too, have extended their informationpolicy beyond their official reporting commit-ments in recent years. The reason for this isthat they wish to lessen market players’ un-certainty about the future policy stance of thecentral bank, and to anchor inflation expect-ations as firmly as possible at the low level en-visaged. Central banks are therefore them-selves interested in making their monetarypolicy actions as transparent as possible.
The perception that optimum anti-inflation-
ary solutions may founder on the lack of con-fidence of the private sector has determinedthe monetary policy debate of the pasttwenty years, just as much as the search forways out of this dilemma.
1The credibility
problem is particularly pressing for centralbanks which, on account of a regime shift(such as the granting of independent statusor the establishment of a monetary union),initially have to act without a relevant “trackrecord”. The option of gaining the confi-

17dence of the private sector by scoring suc-
cesses with respect to the ultimate goal is notavailable to them until a few years haveelapsed because of the long time-lags in thetransmission process. They are therefore ob-liged to offset their lack of reputation bymeans of enhanced communication. Trans-parency here plays the part of self-imposedcommitment: by disclosing the basis of itspolicy decisions, the central bank enables thegeneral public to assess their adequacy andimpose a sanction, if appropriate. At thesame time, the central bank forfeits the op-tion of pursuing a policy other than what ithas announced.
2
The benefits of transparency are, however,not independent of the target function of thecentral bank. Quite a number of academicstudies come to the conclusion that centralbanks are supposed to have an interest inkeeping information secret because beingbetter informed enables them to raise outputand employment, at least in the short run,above the levels planned by the private sec-tor. Since, however, enterprises and house-holds cannot be deceived indefinitely, but willtake due account of the central bank’s behav-iour in their plans, the possibility of exertingtemporary employment effects has to bebought in such models at the price of a per-manent increase in trend inflation above thelevel actually aimed at – the so-called “infla-tion bias”.
3
As can easily be seen, the validity of this scen-ario is confined to central banks in whosetarget function stimulating economic activityhas a similar ranking to safeguarding pricestability. In contrast to this, if a central bank is
committed by law to the ultimate objective ofprice stability, it is in its best interests to com-municate its intentions clearly and convin-cingly from the very outset. For it is only ifeconomic agents are confident that the cen-tral bank will do all it can to discharge itsmandate successfully that the full welfare-en-hancing effects of a stability-oriented monet-ary policy will be unleashed. If, on the otherhand, the central bank fails to convince thegeneral public of the anti-inflationary thrustof its monetary policy, it will have to counter-act the “overshooting” inflation expectationsby pursuing a correspondingly more restrict-ive policy. In this case, longer-term interestrates, too, will contain no-confidence premiawhich will have an adverse impact on invest-ment activity and real growth, and thus jeop-ardise the acceptability of a monetary policygeared to price stability.
The limits to transparency
The above considerations suggest that trans-
parency is basically desirable, and especiallycrucial when the aim is to build up credibilityas fast as possible. This raises the question ofwhat a central bank can best do to make themonetary decision-making process transpar-ent to outsiders. The fact that this question is

18far more difficult to answer in practice than in
the context of simple theoretical models is il-lustrated not least by the strong differencesof opinion about whether a particular monet-ary policy strategy or particular measures,such as the publication of the minutes ofmeetings, are apt to enhance the transpar-ency of monetary policy decisions.
4
In the theoretical literature, it is mostly as-sumed that the way in which monetary policymeasures work (the underlying structural re-lationship) is known to all those involved. Onthis assumption, the generation of full trans-parency is not difficult: it merely requires thepublication of the data and forecasts availableto the central bank at the time the decision istaken.
5Unlike this simple scenario, however,
practical monetary policy is faced with amuch higher degree of uncertainty. One keyfactor of uncertainty is the time-lags arising inthe transmission of monetary policy stimuli tothe demand for goods, output and prices. Asinterest-rate changes as a rule have theirmain impact on the inflation rate only afterone to two years, all central banks have torely on indicator variables which signal theprice trend and the impact of monetary policymeasures as early and reliably as possible. Inorder to create transparency, the monetarypolicy-makers must announce the indicatorsthey rely on and must convince the generalpublic that using these variables as a guide-line is a suitable means of achieving the an-nounced objective within the time horizonrelevant to monetary policy.
However, the central bank cannot provide full
transparency about the transmission mechan-isms and the reliability of the indicators used,
as knowledge of both is but limited withinthe central bank system as well. It is not clear,in particular, how far laws and behaviour pat-terns that were valid in the past can be ex-trapolated into the future. For instance, in thewake of a change of regime, such as thelaunch of a monetary union, structural breaksmust be expected whose implications for themonetary transmission process are difficult togauge at first. Another example of the possi-bility of fundamental structural changes isprovided by the current debate in the UnitedStates on the pace of real growth that is dur-ably consistent with price stability.
Moreover, the very data base available to the
central bank for analytical and forecastingpurposes is subject to considerable uncer-tainty. For example, data from the real sectorundergo frequent and sometimes consider-able revisions. The central bank can, however,generate transparency only with respect tofacts which it knows itself. The limited scaleof knowledge in turn narrows the overallscope for creating transparency.
6
In practice, transparency can therefore onlyever be partial, and never perfect, in thesense of theoretical models. It should also beborne in mind that more information does

19not necessarily result in greater clarity. In view
of the complexity of monetary policy trans-mission mechanisms and the uncertaintiesspecified above, additional information mayeven lead to more confusion if it is presentedto the general public without correspondingelucidation. It is therefore important that thecentral bank should structure the wealth ofinformation relevant to its decisions, and pro-vide the public not only with the “bare” fig-ures but also with its interpretation of them.This task is greatly facilitated by announcing amonetary policy strategy, which is then avail-able as a frame of reference for interpretingthe mass of information.
Whether the thrust of the central bank’s ar-
gumentation, and its actual arguments, arefelt to be transparent also invariably dependsto some extent on the observer’s vantagepoint. In this respect, the Governing Councilof the ECB is in a particularly difficult position:it must convince a public that is characterisedby differences in its way of thinking and by di-vergent national experience of monetary pol-icy of the appropriateness of its decisions.

Ways and means of creating transparency
In view of the problems mentioned, it comes
as no surprise that no agreement has beenreached so far about the measures that aresuitable for enhancing the transparency ofthe monetary decision-making process. How-ever, a number of criteria can be derived fromwhat has been said above, and may be usedas a starting point for assessing the informa-tion policy of individual central banks. Thesestarting points include, besides the an-
nouncement of the ultimate goal, the formu-lation of a consistent monetary policy strat-egy, the publication of, and comments on,the data basis and the detailed substantiationof decisions. The table overleaf provides anoverview of the ways and means chosen bythe Eurosystem and other major centralbanks for enhancing the transparency of theirpolicies in the fields mentioned.
Setting the monetary policy objectivesA clear definition of the ultimate objectives is
obviously an essential prerequisite of thetransparency of decisions. As far as the num-ber of objectives is concerned, it may be saidthat a central bank’s commitment to morethan one objective is transparent only if un-ambiguous weights are assigned to the differ-ent objectives at the same time. Monetarypolicy decisions are even easier to reconstructif central banks have a clear primary object-ive, as has increasingly been the case in re-cent years. One exception to this continues tobe the United States. There, the Federal Re-serve System is committed to promotingstable prices, maximum employment andmoderate long-term interest rates, with noclear ranking being prescribed. In contrast tothat, the Maastricht Treaty and the newJapanese and British Central Bank Acts of1998 unambiguously lay down safeguardingprice stability as the overriding ultimate goalof monetary policy.

21The clarity of the target definition can be in-
creased by quantifying the concept of pricestability or by setting an “inflation target”.However, the quantification of price stabilityinvolves a conflict between the desire for asprecise a definition as possible and the not in-considerable problems posed by the exactmeasurement of inflation. The GoverningCouncil of the ECB therefore decided to de-fine price stability as an increase of less than2% against the previous year in the harmon-ised consumer price index of the euro area asa whole. As this definition is intended to ex-clude both a decline in, and an increase inconsumer prices of 2% and more, it can beinterpreted as a range of between slightlyover zero and just under two percent. Onereason why the target has been set slightlyabove the zero line is that the measured infla-tion rate presumably overstates the actual in-flation rate.
8Another point arguing in favour
of a range is that, in the short run, inflationalso owes something to factors beyond thecontrol of the central bank, such as wage andfiscal policies or external influences. In orderto emphasise its responsibility for the longer-term inflation trend, the Governing Councilof the ECB has clearly based its quantitativedefinition of price stability on the mediumterm.
In the United Kingdom, the government spe-
cifies an inflation target for the central bank.The present government has opted for a sin-gle-figure target of 2.5% per annum for therise in the consumer-price index RPIX (whichexcludes mortgage rates). If the current infla-tion rate moves more than one percentagepoint above or below the prescribed inflationtarget, the Governor of the Bank of England
must explain the reasons why to the Chancel-lor of the Exchequer and spell out the requis-ite monetary policy measures. This arrange-ment likewise takes explicit account of thefact that inflation cannot be controlled in theshort run. The central bank is, however,deemed accountable if the current inflationrate deviates from the specified range of theinflation target. Hence, the time horizon ofthe target is distinctly shorter than that in theEurosystem. This strictness appears to be notunproblematical, as it might force policy-makers to respond to temporary price shocks,and, given the existing time-lags, might thusbe counterproductive.
Defining the monetary policy strategyIn order to create transparency, the policy-
makers also have to disclose how they intendto achieve price stability or the announced in-flation target, and they must convince thegeneral public that the strategy chosen issuitable for the purpose. Here, too, there is apotential trade-off between the desire forclarity, which would suggest announcing adecision rule that is as simple as possible,and the existing uncertainty about the “true”transmission mechanism, which tends toadvocate the use of as large a number of indi-cators as possible.
If a variable can be found which, on the one
hand, can be controlled by the central bankwith sufficient accuracy and, on the other,

22has a stable correlation with the ultimate
target variable, that variable can be used asan intermediate target. A “classical” strategyusing an intermediate target is the specifica-tion of a monetary target. In a strategy ofmonetary targeting consistent with produc-tion potential, such as was pursued by theBundesbank between 1975 and 1998, thebasic idea is to manage the supply of moneyin such a way that production potential isfully utilised without generating any inflation-ary pressures. The target set is therefore com-posed of the growth rate of potential outputplus the medium-term price assumption. Inaddition, any trend decline (or increase) in thevelocity of circulation of money must betaken into account by incorporating a corres-ponding add-on (or discount).Gearing monetary policy to an intermediate
target not only affords the central bank scopefor responding to undesirable developmentsat an early date, but also makes it easier forall economic agents to assess monetary pol-icy. However, a number of central banks hadto relinquish the use of intermediate monet-ary targets because formerly stable relation-ships between the money stock and priceshad become much looser. A case in point isthe United States. There, the Humphrey-Haw-kins Act of 1978 requires the Federal ReserveSystem to announce annual targets formoney and credit growth and explain anyfailures to meet those targets to Congressand the general public.
9Frequent and unfore-
seeable deviations of the velocity of circula-tion of money from its historical trend have,however, considerably reduced the import-ance of these targets for US monetary policyand led to the Federal Reserve System pursu-ing, in effect, a purely discretionary policy.
A number of other countries, including the
United Kingdom, have adopted a strategy ofdirect inflation control – known as “inflationtargeting”. Central banks using this strategybase their assessment of future inflationtrends on a large number of indicators fromthe real and monetary spheres. In order to en-hance the transparency of the inflation as-sessment, some of them publish quantitativeinflation forecasts for the time-horizon of twoyears that is relevant to monetary policy. Inthis case, the inflation forecast of the centralbank practically performs the role of an inter-Level during month, seasonally adjusted, log. scale

23mediate target: if the forecast overshoots the
official inflation target, that signals a need toraise interest rates, and vice versa. The recon-structability of monetary policy decisions aspart of this strategy is thus subject to the con-dition that the central bank discloses how theinflation forecasts are made.
The Eurosystem decided to adopt a two-pillar
strategy. The first pillar of this strategy assignsa prominent role to the money stock, which isemphasised by setting a quantitative refer-ence value for the growth of the broadmoney stock M3. The empirical foundation isprovided by a number of studies which havefound that, in the past, there has been astable long-term relationship between themoney stock M3 and the price level in theeuro area.
10Since, on the other hand, it was
not impossible that the move to monetaryunion would change the payment and invest-ment patterns of households and enterprises,the Governing Council of the ECB decided toannounce a reference value, which is lessbinding, rather than a monetary target. It alsodecided to supplement the use of monetarygrowth as a guideline by a second pillar, inthe form of a broadly-based assessment ofthe outlook for prices.
The two-pillar strategy of the Eurosystem has
been criticised by many observers as beingnon-transparent. This criticism is understand-able insofar as drawing on two criteria– monetary developments and the outlookfor prices – basically involves the risk of con-flicting signals being received. On the otherhand, the decision of the Governing Councilof the ECB must be seen against the back-ground of the particular uncertainty sur-
rounding the change in the monetary policyregime. In these circumstances it is not impos-sible that a primary gearing to the moneystock might lead to wrong decisions in somesituations, nor does it seem safe to assumethat assessing the outlook for prices solely onthe basis of other indicators would ensure ap-propriate reactions in all cases. Hence policy-makers must have the discretion to weightcontrasting signals on an ad hoc basis. Thisdiscretionary latitude, however, places heav-ier demands on the central bank’s informa-tion policy. So as to ensure that the decisionsare reconstructable by outsiders, the assess-ment of prevailing conditions and the back-ground of the adopted monetary policystance must be communicated at an earlydate, on a regular basis and in a comprehen-sible manner.
Publishing the data and forecastsA basic prerequisite of a transparent policy is
the disclosure of the data basis available tothe central bank at the time decisions aretaken. However, what matters is not so muchthe publication of all the information avail-able as the selection and explanation of thosefactors which are relevant to the decision-making process.
Consequently, the contribution made to the
transparency of policy decisions by the publi-cation of forecasts depends on the monetary

24policy strategy. If a monetary targeting strat-
egy is pursued, the central bank’s and generalpublic’s interest focuses on the movement ofthe monetary aggregate serving as the inter-mediate target. As far as reviewing compli-ance with the target is concerned, this strat-egy has the advantage that the money stockfigures are realised statistical variables whichcan be observed unambiguously by the gen-eral public. The full benefit of this advantagecan be enjoyed, however, only if the correl-ation between the money stock and prices issufficiently stable, so that direct conclusionsabout the outlook for prices can be drawnfrom the observation of a target deviation. If,however, the basic relationships are tempor-arily distorted by other factors, the generalpublic has to base its assessment also on theinterpretation supplied by the central bank ofmonetary developments and of other indica-
tors considered to be relevant.
If direct inflation targeting is practised, the as-
sessment of future price movements is of pri-mary interest. In this case, the publication ofa quantitative inflation projection provides acentral reference point for the debate, andtherefore basically enhances transparency.Projections, however, need much elucidation.This applies, firstly, to the estimation methodsused in making the projection. Secondly, theassumptions about the development of majorexogenous variables, such as exchange rates,commodity prices etc., must be disclosed.Thirdly, the question of whether the projec-tion is based on the assumption of constantcentral bank interest rates or whether anyneed to adjust interest rates has already beentaken into account is of key importance.Fourthly, the projection must also include in-formation on the degree of uncertainty andthe distribution of risks around the centralprojection value. Fifthly, it must be clear whois responsible for the projection.
In its quarterly Inflation Reports, the Bank of
England publishes inflation projections basedon the assumption of unchanged centralbank interest rates as well as projectionsbased on market expectations of the futurestance of monetary policy. To present theforecasts, so-called fan charts are used, whichillustrate the degree of uncertainty and thedistribution of risks around the central projec-tion. The effects of alternative assumptionsabout the development of major exogenousvariables on the central projection value arequantified in a supplementary table.

25Despite the careful presentation of the pro-
jections, however, it is difficult for outsidersto reconstruct the forecasting method in de-tail. Although the macroeconomic modelswhich provide the starting point of the pro-jections were published by the Bank of Eng-land, a large number of additional influencesnot incorporated in the models are includedin the forecasting process, alongside the re-sults generated by the models. Assessment ofthis “off-model” information, of the degreeof uncertainty and of the distribution of risksis effected by the members of the MonetaryPolicy Committee, who are also responsiblefor the “end-product”. The general publichas no means of knowing, however, whichfactors are included in the inflation projec-tion, and how they are weighted. The publi-cation of the projections therefore does notsubstantially reduce the discretionary scopeavailable to the policy-makers. This applies allthe more, given the magnitude of the fore-casting uncertainty applying to the forecast-ing horizons that are relevant to monetarypolicy. Thus the band into which the futureinflation rate falls with a 90% probability al-ready covers about two percentage points forthe one-year horizon. For a two-year horizonit increases to 2
12percentage points and
more.11
In the United States, the members of the Fed-eral Reserve Board and the Federal ReserveBank presidents come up with quantitativegrowth and inflation forecasts twice a year.Information on the range and central ten-dency of these projections is published aspart of the reports on monetary policy whichthe Chairman of the Federal Reserve Systempresents to Congress in February and July of
each year. These figures, too, suggest a con-siderable degree of uncertainty surroundingthe projections. For example, the views re-garding the inflation prospects for a timehorizon of 1
12years ranged from 1.5% to
2.75% in July 1999, and thus covered a bandof distinctly more than one percentagepoint.

26data. Moreover, the occurrence of structural
breaks or structural adjustment processescannot be ruled out in the first few years ofmonetary union. Forecasts, however, arebased on econometric models reflecting lawsand behaviour patterns observed in the past.If presumptions about structural changes atthe end of a series are to be included in theforecasts, this requires discretionary interven-tion in the models, which is hardly recon-structable by outsiders. Hence inflation fore-casts for the euro area are subject to evengreater uncertainty than usual. Even so, thePresident of the ECB has publicly advocatedthe publication of union-wide forecasts laterthis year. If the ECB were actually to take thisstep, the particular uncertainty surroundingthe nature and scale of the figures publishedwould have to be borne in mind. Moreover,the (limited) weight of the forecasts in the
monetary decision-making process wouldhave to be explained by an active communi-cation policy.
Announcing the interest-rate decisionsOther approaches to generating transparency
are the announcement of current monetarypolicy decisions and, if appropriate, the prep-aration of the markets for future interest-ratemoves. The immediate announcement ofmonetary policy decisions is now a matter ofcourse in most countries. Thus all the centralbanks listed in the table on page 20 informthe general public immediately after meet-ings of the decision-making bodies whether adecision to change official interest rates hasbeen taken.
13
Central banks are less inclined to inform thegeneral public about their assessment of theneed for future interest-rate adjustments.One exception here is the Reserve Bank ofNew Zealand, which publishes in its MonetaryPolicy Statements not only other forecastsbut also the interest-rate path which wouldbring down inflation to a level of 1.5% (themiddle of the target range) over a time hori-zon of one to two years.

Policy-makers would then run the risk ofbeing forced to act, since correcting the as-sessment, once it has been announced,might call into question their credibility andcompetence.
15
Recent experience of the US Federal ReserveSystem of making statements about thethrust of future interest-rate policy (known as“bias announcements”) shows that this con-cern is not unwarranted. In an effort to in-crease transparency, the US Federal OpenMarket Committee (FOMC) had decided inDecember 1998 to announce in future, im-mediately after the meetings, how the major-ity of members viewed the likely direction ofthe next movement in rates (tightening, loos-ening or neutral bias). When it turned out inthe course of the year, however, that the biasannouncements tended to provoke moreconfusion than clarity, the FOMC commis-sioned a working party to look at alternatives.Following the latter’s suggestion, the FOMCdecided at the beginning of this year to re-place the bias statements by an assessmentof the risks to balanced economic growth, ex-plicitly covering the foreseeable future – andthus a much longer period than that up tothe next meeting. The FOMC members havea choice between three standard formulae:the risks are weighted mainly toward condi-tions that may generate heightened inflationpressure, or mainly toward conditions thatmay generate economic weakness, or therisks are balanced.
16
The new system is intended to make it clearerthan before to the markets that, given thegreat uncertainties surrounding future trends,
the Fed can do no more than assess risks, andthat those risks have to be reassessed as soonas more information becomes available. Thisnew system of announcements gives the Fedgreater latitude again without exposing it tothe criticism that it has abandoned its effortsto enhance transparency.
In line with the Fed approach, the ECB, too,
has recently been pointing out that the risksto price stability are rising in the mediumterm. Moreover, a growing tendency is dis-cernible in many countries towards preparingthe markets for forthcoming interest-ratemoves by including hints to that effect inspeeches and publications. The intention is toreduce uncertainty and to steer market ex-pectations in the direction desired by the cen-tral bank. This does not imply, however, thatevery monetary policy measure can be pre-pared a long time in advance and be fullyforeseeable. Instead, situations are conceiv-able in which surprise monetary policy deci-sions are required – for instance, to arrest un-desirable developments in the financial mar-kets. Policy-makers must therefore preservethe freedom to disagree with the views of themarkets, and to take market participants bysurprise, if necessary.
Means of communicationMonetary policy-makers have a variety of
means of communication at their disposal for

28explaining their views on economic condi-
tions and the reasons for their decisions. Theextent to which the various instruments areused depends, among other things, on thegiven institutional framework and on trad-ition. It is therefore hardly surprising that thesignificance of individual means of communi-cation differs from central bank to centralbank.
In the United States, the reports on monetary
policy which the Fed Chairman delivers toCongress twice a year are traditionally amajor instrument of communication policy.Current monetary policy decisions are eluci-dated mainly by the publication of the min-utes of meetings which both reflect the dis-cussions in the FOMC (without giving anynames) and disclose the voting by individualmembers. The minutes are not published,however, until some days after the followingmeeting, i.e. with a time-lag of six to eightweeks. Moreover, it is a controversial pointwhether the disclosure of differences of opin-ion in the committee increases the transpar-ency of monetary policy decisions. This is sug-gested by the fact that it gives markets anidea of the uncertainty and risks involved inassessing economic conditions. On the otherhand, there is a risk of too much attentionbeing paid to the views of individual mem-bers and less to the committee’s overall as-sessment.
The Bank of Japan has likewise been publish-
ing minutes of its meetings since 1998, witha time-lag of about one month. A more time-ly means of communication are the monthlyreports, which are published after the firstmonthly meeting of the Policy Board and in-
clude an introductory statement by the Boardon the latest economic and financial develop-ments. In addition, once a month – alwaystwo days after the first monthly meeting ofthe Policy Board – a press conference is heldat which the Governor explains the currentpolicy stance.
At the centre of the Bank of England’s infor-
mation policy are the quarterly Inflation Re-ports, which contain both an in-depth analy-sis of monetary and real economic trends andthe inflation and growth projections of theMonetary Policy Committee. Background in-formation on monetary policy decisions isalso imparted to the general public by thepublication of the minutes of meetings,which are made public two weeks after eachmeeting.

Great value is also attached to thepress conferences, which are held regularlyimmediately after the first monthly meetingof the Governing Council of the ECB.

29answers journalists’ questions. The Governing
Council of the ECB has decided not to publishthe minutes of its meetings, primarily becauseof the special features of the Eurosystem as asupranational institution. In view of the Euro-pean mandate assigned to the GoverningCouncil, this decision was motivated chieflyby the desire to preclude any possible re-nationalisation of monetary policy by thepublication of the voting behaviour of individ-ual members, and to enhance the collectiveresponsibility of the Governing Council of theECB.
Outlook
The object of the above analysis was to give
an overview of possible approaches to, andinstruments for, creating transparency inmonetary policy. All the central banks ana-lysed here have attempted in recent years tocommunicate, on a regular and comprehen-sive basis, their views on economic conditionsand the background to their monetary policydecisions. This applies with particular force tothe Bank of England and the European Cen-tral Bank, whose main aim has been tobuild up credibility as fast as possible after achange in the monetary policy regime.Even so, in recent months both central banks
have had to grapple with criticism of a lack oftransparency. The Bank of England, for ex-ample, was faced with the reproach that thecredibility and transparency of its inflationforecasts had diminished as a consequence ofthe independence granted to it.
17The Euro-
system, by contrast, was chiefly criticised forthe monetary policy strategy it chose, andalso for its failure to publish the minutes of itsmeetings. This criticism was not altogethersurprising, it is true, as new ground wasbroken by the adoption of the two-pillarstrategy. On the other hand, the advocates ofthe two alternative proposals – monetary tar-geting or inflation targeting – have so farfailed to prove that a one-dimensional strat-egy is not only more transparent but alsopromises to be more successful with respectto the ultimate objective of price stability.However, in view of the change of regimeand the uncertainties involved, the two-pillarstrategy at present continues to appear su-perior to both alternatives. Its complexitymakes heavy demands, though, on the Euro-system’s information policy.

31West German enter-
prises’ profitabilityand financing in1998According to the provisional figures of
the Bundesbank’s corporate balancesheet statistics, the profitability of westGerman enterprises in the producing,wholesale/retail trade and transportsectors showed a further strong im-provement in 1998. This enabled themto make good the drop in earnings inthe wake of the recession in 1993 andthe renewed setback in 1996. The re-turn on turnover matched the levelachieved in the late eighties/early nine-ties, which also had a positive effect onthe remuneration of fixed capital. Cor-porate financing was also further re-inforced. The ratio of own funds tototal liabilities regained the level ofthe late eighties. This was made pos-sible, on the one hand, by firms’ quiterobust internal generation of financialresources since 1997 and their greaterreadiness to go public and, on theother, by the deep capacity of the cap-ital market to absorb new equityissues, which is doubtless connectedwith the burgeoning shareholder cul-ture that is now emerging in Germanyon the part of savers. The advancesmade in profitability and financingalso played a key part in ensuring thatthe slackening of growth in the wakeof the crises in eastern Asia and Russiadid not lead to a slump in corporate in-vestment in the course of 1999.

32Cyclical setting
In 1998 the German economy initially con-
tinued on the path of growth on which it hadembarked in the spring of 1996.
1The under-
lying economic momentum weakened per-ceptibly in the second half of the year, how-ever. In the wake of the general worsening ofthe global economic climate which emanatedfrom the turmoil in the international financialmarkets, exports (including services) declinedafter the middle of the year. Moreover, do-mestic demand at the end of the year was nolonger strong enough to compensate for thegrowing external burdens. On average during1998 this weakening was not fully reflectedin the macroeconomic figures. Exports in-creased by 7% in real terms while import de-mand expanded at the very robust rate of8
12%. Domestic demand grew by 212%i n
price-adjusted terms. As a result, real GDPgrew by 2
14%, which was34percentage
point more than in 1997. At the same time,capacity utilisation increased somewhat forthe first time in a long while, though it didnot reach its normal level. Buoyed by a posi-tive terms-of-trade effect, the increase in thereal value of national disposable income im-proved by as much as 1
12percentage points.
Of the components of domestic demand, (be-
sides the sizeable build-up of stocks) invest-ment in machinery and equipment notablyrose very steeply by over 9% Germany-wide.An even more dynamic trend was shown byother fixed assets (+ 15%), which inter alia in-
clude investment in intangible assets. That sug-gests a favourable investment climate whichbenefited from a higher rate of capacity utilisa-tion, an eased cost situation and continuing im-
provements in corporate earnings. Positivestimuli were also provided by wage policywhich – as in the preceding years – followed amoderate course. In addition, the financingconditions were exceptionally advantageous.Another mainstay of economic activity in 1998was private consumption, which expanded na-tionwide by almost 2
12% in real terms. House-
holds also benefited from the fact that the pur-chasing power of their incomes was augment-ed by the substantial cheapening of importedgoods, especially mineral oil products, in thecontext of a generally favourable price climate.
By contrast, industrial construction invest-
ment in western Germany declined further in1998. Not least on account of the increaseduse of microelectronics, the upturn in invest-ment in machinery and equipment was ac-companied even less than in the past by aneed to extend building capacity. Investmentin new residential dwellings in western Ger-many likewise fell over twelve months, al-though not as steeply as in eastern Germany.As public customers, too, cut back on theirconstruction activity, overall construction in-vestment recorded a further marked fall inwestern Germany.
1With the changeover of the national accounts to ESA
’95, which occurred at the end of April 1999 for the
main GDP output and expenditure aggregates, the separ-
ate calculation of GDP for western Germany and eastern
Germany (which had been customary until then) was dis-
continued. (However, it will soon be possible to compute
aggregate annual data broken down by western and
eastern Germany using GDP figures relating to individual
Länder which the working group ”National Accounts of
the Länder“ will again publish regularly as from mid-
2000). Owing to the comparatively small macroeconomic
weight of the new Länder, the figures for Germany as a
whole nevertheless probably provide quite an accurate
reflection of the basic trends in western Germany.Overall trend

33The various economic sectors covered by the
corporate balance sheet statistics participated inthe favourable overall economic developmentto very different degrees. West German manu-facturing firms stepped up their production by afairly robust 5%, with producers of capitalgoods and durable consumer goods faring par-ticularly well. A leading role was played by theautomotive industry; its output rose by 15% onaverage over the year. The brisk production ac-tivity in the manufacturing sector also boostedbusiness in the transport and wholesale tradesectors. In the latter sector the sales volumewent up by ”only“ 1% nationwide in 1998, butthat was chiefly attributable to the decrease inraw material prices. In real terms wholesaletrade turnover increased by 3
12%. The retail
trade, which similarly experienced a perceptiblerise in price-adjusted turnover, profited from thestronger consumption demand. On the otherhand, the adjustment crisis in the constructionsector persisted in 1998. The output of the westGerman basic building trade (which admittedlyis only a part of the overall construction sector)dropped by 1
12% to a level which was 1512%
lower than the peak reached in 1994. That inturn had a strong negative impact on thequarrying industry. The output of the electricity,gas and water supply sector stagnated at thedepressed level of 1997.
The output of the sectors examined here,
which accounts for about half of the realvalue added generated by firms in Germany,probably grew more or less as strongly in1998 as that of the services sector, which isvery thinly represented in the Bundesbank’sbalance sheet material. It would be prema-ture, however, to conclude that the earningstrend of the industrial sectors matched that
of the services sector. Manufacturing firms, inparticular, face tough international competi-tion which is often reflected in strong down-ward pressure on margins, whereas serviceproviders tend to focus more on the domesticmarket and usually have greater scope whenit comes to pricing. Nevertheless, the datafrom the corporate balance sheet statisticsprobably provide a fairly accurate reflectionof west German firms’ profitability and finan-cing on the whole.
Annual result and return on turnover
Following the leap in the profit level in 1997,
the positive earnings trend continued at amore muted pace in 1998.
2According to ini-
tial calculations, the annual result beforetaxes on income improved by 14% and wasthus approximately one-and-a-half times ashigh as in the trough of 1996.
3It was more
2The following analysis encompasses 21,840 sets of an-
nual accounts, which equates to two-fifths of the total
balance sheet data normally to be expected for one fi-
nancial year. For the purposes of analysis, the expanded
results for 1997, updated on the basis of the Federal Stat-
istical Office’s turnover tax statistics, were extrapolated
using the trend in a likewise expanded cylindered sample
of enterprises, so as to obtain figures which are compar-
able with those of 1997. Past experience shows that this
method of calculation reflects the major changes quite
well, although it cannot equal the accuracy of the final
expansion, which is currently based on about 50,000 sets
of annual accounts. For further details, see the article
”The methodological basis of the Deutsche Bundesbank’s
corporate balance sheet statistics“, Monthly Report, Oc-
tober 1998, pages 49 to 64.
3The annual result corresponds to the profit for the year
before profit/loss transfers and provides a better indica-
tion of the profits generated by the enterprises analysed
in this article, since numerous firms are associated
through profit transfer agreements (and partial profit
transfer agreements) with enterprises which are not re-
corded in the corporate balance sheet statistics (e.g.
holding companies) to which their profits/losses are trans-
ferred.Economic

34than twice as high as the especially low earn-
ings level of 1993. It also clearly exceeded therecord figure achieved during the reunifica-tion boom at the beginning of the nineties.This picture must be put into perspective,however, by noting that the firms have ex-panded their business activities in the mean-time. The gross return on turnover, which isthe ratio of enterprises’ annual result beforetaxes on income to their turnover, went up in1998 by
12percentage point to 312%; in
doing so, it regained the average profitabilityachieved between 1988 and 1990.
West German firms often fare poorly in inter-
national comparisons of profitability based ongross return on turnover and, in particular,appear to trail quite a long way behind theearnings ratios of Anglo-Saxon countries.While this finding is doubtless fundamentallyvalid, the informative value of such compari-sons is considerably lessened by the differentcountry-specific rules for calculating profit.The profit as disclosed in German financialstatements tends to be understated, not leaston account of the comparatively major im-portance attached to creditor protectionrights and of the prudence principle in Ger-man accounting.
4This contrasts with, say, US
accounting practices which focus on the in-formation needs of investors and on short-term dividend interests, as a result of whichdisclosed profits tend to be much closer tothe ”real“ earnings level than is the case inGermany. The differences are especially largewhen it comes to depreciation practices. ThusEnterprises’ profit and loss account*

perceptibly more slowly than the correspond-ing gross figure. The main reason for this wasa further sharp rise by over one-fifth in in-come tax payments in 1998, which is exam-ined in greater detail below. Consequently,the net return on turnover improved by”only“
14percentage point to just over 2% –
a level which was last achieved in the years1988 to 1990. In the recession year 1993 thisfigure had stood at 1%. When interpretingthe data on net return on turnover it shouldbe remembered that taxes on income andearnings, besides trade earnings tax, exclu-sively comprise the taxes on income payableby incorporated enterprises, whereas theprofit for the year of unincorporated enter-prises (partnerships and sole proprietors) istaxed as part of those entrepreneurs’ privateincome. Hence the actual net return on turn-over is lower than the level given here.
Given the buoyant economic situation in in-
dustry during the year under review, it is notsurprising that manufacturing firms wereagain able to achieve an above-average in-crease in their gross annual result amounting
to 15
12%. This was no less than three-fifths
higher than the depressed result achieved in1996. This finding is corroborated by the factthat the profit-turnover ratio likewise im-proved by
12percentage point to 412%.
However, the individual industries within themanufacturing sector participated in thisearnings growth to widely differing extents.One of the most profitable subsectors wasthe statistical group ”Manufacture of othertransport equipment“, which comprises ship-building, the construction of aircraft andspacecraft and the manufacture of rollingstock; it more than doubled its annual result.One peculiarity of this subsector is that theannual accounts of the firms in it are some-times massively influenced by the settlementof large-scale orders. Other industries with anabove-average performance were basic metalmanufacturers, the automotive industry andmanufacturers of office machinery and com-puters. At the bottom of the table were themanufacturers of electrical machinery andapparatus, who suffered a steep decline inearnings. Manufacturers of machinery andequipment, who had experienced a sharpsurge in profitability in 1997, achieved only arelatively small profit increase in 1998, notleast because of the marked weakening offoreign demand in the course of the year. Inaddition, certain branches of industry, espe-cially in the durable and non-durable con-sumer goods industries, were unable to keeppace with the general earnings trend.
Although the profit level of the electricity, gas
and water supply sector in 1998 was ”barely“one-tenth higher before taxes and 5% after

36taxes compared with 1997, the sector main-
tained its position at the upper end of theprofit yield range with a large lead over theother industries included in the analysis. Theirgross return on turnover in excess of 10%was more than twice as high as that of themanufacturing sector, which was the secondbest performer. The greater profitability en-joyed by the utilities is presumably attribut-able to the fact that, for many years, theirmarkets were characterised by a low level ofcompetition and regional monopolies. It islikely that the liberalisation of the energymarkets which has meanwhile been set intrain at the European level – and which lastyear already triggered a sharp fall in the priceof electricity – will lead to a marked reductionof this sector’s profitability in future.
Contrary to what the lacklustre state of busi-
ness activity in the construction sector mighthave suggested, earnings in the west Germanconstruction sector rose in 1998 for the firsttime since 1992. The gross return on turnoverincreased from just over 1% in 1997 to 2%,although this was still only half as high as therate of profit experienced during the boomphase in the early nineties. All in all, the build-ing industry is still a long way from posting anadequate level of profits. Construction firmsachieved their turnaround by slowing the de-cline in total output and by keeping costsmore firmly under control than they managedto in the preceding years.
In a context of moderate growth, the whole-
sale trade merely managed to maintain theprevious year’s earnings level. Following verystrong profit growth in 1997, retail trade en-terprises actually suffered a drop of 5
12%i n
their gross annual result in 1998. The declinein profitability compared with the late eight-ies/early nineties (measured by return onturnover) is much greater among retailtraders than among wholesalers. This may beconnected with the fact that, for quite awhile now, turnover has not kept pace withthe growth of private consumption on ac-count of shifts in consumption behaviour. An-other factor is that price competition be-tween the dominant retail groups has notice-ably sharpened in recent years.
Income and cost in detail
Total output, which is made up of turnover
plus changes in stocks of own products andother capitalised production, grew by justover 2
12% in 1998; that was 2 percentage
points less than in the previous year. At firstsight this would seem to fit in well with thedeceleration of profit growth in 1998 com-pared with 1997 in the sectors analysed. Oncloser inspection, however, it transpires thatthe weaker growth of business activity wasrelated quite closely to the sharp fall in importprices in 1998 which was at least partlypassed on in the form of factory gate pricesand so led to lower producer prices. There-fore there is no contradiction between theslackening rate of expansion of total outputand the acceleration of real macroeconomicgrowth. A similar interpretation may be ap-plied to the trend in the manufacturing sec-tor, the total output of which rose by 4% in1998 compared with 7% in the previousyear. That is largely borne out by the official... in construc-

37statistics covering mining and manufacturing
in western Germany, according to which theturnover growth of 5% in 1997 slowed tonot quite 3% in 1998. Yet net production –as was stated at the beginning of this article –increased distinctly faster in 1998 than in theprevious year. The fall in import and producerprices also retarded the expansion of totaloutput in the wholesale and retail trade. Inthe electricity, gas and water supply sectortotal output even dipped below the 1997level. The construction sector was somethingof an exception in this respect in that the de-cline in its total output by – 1% was percep-tibly smaller than in the three previous years.
In contrast to total output, interest received
and other income grew much more briskly in1998 than in 1997, with the result that totalincome rose by just over 3% (following alittle more than 4
12% in 1997). One factor
behind the increase in interest received wasthat the stock of interest-bearing debtors andinvestments on average during 1998 wasnearly one-tenth above the correspondinglevel in the previous year. Another factor wasthat the average rate of credit interest earnedby firms in 1998 improved slightly from 4%to 4
14%. Of the various individual sub-items
which make up other income, income fromparticipating interests and extraordinary in-come increased significantly, in particular. Inaddition, other operating income expandedrather strongly; this may have been partly dueto the fact that from 1998 enterprises haveto progressively release their previous provi-sions for anticipated losses related to incom-plete contracts, thereby boosting the dis-closed profit.

38of the rise in other income was attributable
to manufacturing firms, which produce lessthan half the total output of all economic sec-tors covered by the study.
Total cost went up in 1998 by 3%, i.e. not
quite as fast as total income. This owed muchto the fact that the cost of materials, which isthe largest expense item and accounts for al-most 60% of total cost, rose by little morethan 2
12%, not least owing to lower prices
for imported intermediate goods. While theaggregate cost of materials for all enterprisesthus grew in line with total output, this wasnot the case for individual sectors. In manu-facturing and construction, for example, thetrend towards a higher ratio of intermediategoods continued. An opposite tendencymanifested itself, by contrast, among publicutilities and in the transport sector. This mayhave been associated with declining raw ma-terial prices (especially for mineral oil prod-ucts), which in those two sectors are a majorfactor in the cost of materials and expend-iture on goods purchased.
Labour cost also grew at the rate of 2
12%
after having increased by no more than 1%in 1997. The primary reason for this largerrise in personnel expenses in the year underreview was probably that in 1998 there was amarked deceleration in the shedding of la-bour in the segment of west German busi-nesses analysed. This applies, in particular, tothe basic building trade in which, accordingto the official statistics, the number of per-sons employed decreased by not quite 4% in1998, compared with a fall of roughly – 7%in each of the two preceding years. The de-cline in employment in the manufacturing
sector, which had amounted to around 3
12%
per year between 1995 and 1997, virtuallycame to a halt in 1998 on an annual average.Wage growth in 1998 was similarly moderateas it had been in the previous year. Thus ac-tual earnings in the west German producingindustry – as in 1997 – were only 1
12%
above the previous year’s level. In wholesaleand retail trade and in the transport sector(including hotel and restaurant services) ac-tual earnings increased by around 1%.
The cost of depreciation, which had fallen in
the years 1994 to 1996 and had risen onlyslightly in 1997, increased by the fairly size-able margin of 5% in 1998. The volume ofdepreciation of tangible fixed assets (includ-ing special depreciation) rose by just under3% as against 1
12% in 1997. Given that tax
laws remained more or less unchanged, thechief cause of this larger increase appears tobe that – according to data from the ifo insti-tute – investment in machinery and equip-ment in western Germany in 1997 and 1998grew at an exceptionally dynamic pace innominal terms, namely by around one-fifthaltogether. As moveable fixed assets are fre-quently depreciated using the diminishing-balance method, this automatically pushedup the charge for the consumption of fixedcapital. Other depreciation, which mainlyconsists of losses on debtors and write-downsof investments and participating interests, ac-tually increased by more than one-fifth in1998. This was principally attributable toexceptional developments in individual manu-facturing industries.Total cost and

39Furthermore, for the first time since 1992,
the corporate profit and loss accounts in1998 show an increase in interest paidamounting to 5%. This is due exclusively tothe sharp expansion of the stock of creditorsincurring interest, which grew by more than6
12% on average in 1998 compared with
the previous year. The average debit interestrate payable by enterprises was unchanged at5
12%. By contrast, the net interest paid de-
creased by 212% thanks to the much faster
growth of interest received.
German firms’ tax burden increased at a
much more moderate pace (412%) in 1998
than in 1997 (+ 1112%). One factor in this
was the abolition with effect from January 1,1998 of trade capital tax which, togetherwith tax on land and buildings and excisetaxes, had constituted other taxes. This sub-item of taxation was 3% lower in 1998. Onthe other hand, taxes on income and earn-ings jumped by 21% in 1998 over twelvemonths, which was similar to the surge re-corded in 1997. Such a large increase appearssomewhat surprising at first, bearing in mindthat the solidarity surcharge was lowered atthe start of 1998 from 7.5% to 5.5% andthat the increase in the gross annual resultwas much more moderate than in 1997.There are indications, however, that tax pre-payments were not adjusted to the lessfavourable earnings trend (which began toemerge only after the course of businessstarted to slacken after mid-1998) until to-wards the end of the year, i.e. with a certaintime-lag. An alternative explanation is that –unlike in the previous years – tax loss carryfor-wards were claimed on a fairly small scaleonly. The abolition of trade capital tax, which
had been deductible from profit, played acertain role in that – taken in isolation – thisraised the assessment basis for taxing corpor-ate earnings.
Sources and uses of funds
The total sources of funds
5, which expresses
the financial capacity available to west Ger-man firms for the formation of financial andnon-financial assets, was more than one-quarter higher in 1998 than a year before,having expanded by as much as two-thirdssince 1996. More than four-fifths of the in-crease was generated from external sources,whose weight in total funding grew by13 percentage points vis-à-vis 1997 to 35%.Such large (and at times even larger) sharesof external financing in the aggregate finan-cing volume were last seen in the period1988 to 1991. This suggests that in phases ofdynamic investment and business growthfirms have to resort more and more to exter-nal funding. By contrast, the trend in internalfinancing sources, which are largely limited to”earned“ depreciation allowances whichgrow at a relatively steady pace, shows lessvolatility through the cycle.
Furthermore, there are numerous indications
of a transformation in the financing behav-iour of larger enterprises, in particular, whichis reflected in the appropriation of an increas-ing share of the profit to dividends and hence

40a simultaneous greater need to recover the
distributed capital through external financing.An important indication of this could be thefact that, despite strong earnings growth, thesize of the capital increases resulting from re-tained earnings (and the subscribed capital ofunincorporated enterprises) remained largelyunchanged, whereas the external injectionsof equity capital into incorporated enterprisesmore than doubled. This finding is supportedby data from the capital market statistics onthe sales of new shares in Germany in 1998.The remaining additional financing require-ments were met by stepping up new borrow-ing, primarily through bank loans and trans-fers of funds from affiliated enterprises. Therewas a particularly strong demand for long-term credits. On the other hand, the increasesin trade debtors owed by counterparties (andin the trade creditors owed to counterparties)were smaller than previously. A major reasonfor this is likely to have been that corporateturnover expanded a lot more slowly in 1998than in 1997 – as was pointed out at the be-ginning of this article.
Concerning the uses of funds, firms again
showed a preference for the acquisition of fi-nancial assets, which absorbed 37

41example, manufacturing firms, which are at
the centre of the business cycle, increasedtheir gross fixed asset formation by morethan one-tenth in nominal terms which –given virtually stable prices – represented areal increase of almost equal magnitude.However, non-financial asset formation bythe electricity, gas and water supply sectorfell sharply. This is consistent with the datafrom the ifo institute’s survey of investors ac-cording to which the public electricity andgas utilities and the water supply companiesfurther retrenched their capital formation in1998, not least on account of the high supplystandard already reached in Germany. For therest, firms’ aggregate gross asset formation innew plant exceeded the consumption offixed capital by an even greater margin thanin 1997; that seems to indicate a consolida-tion of the positive growth trend that was ini-tiated in 1997 with regard to the capitalstock, which had severely contracted be-tween 1993 and 1996.
Of the main categories of financial assets, the
resources channelled into the acquisition ofparticipating interests were increased by thelargest amount; they were one-and-a-halftimes greater than the previous year’s level. Interms of amount, this rise accounted forthree-quarters of the extra resources availablefor overall financial asset acquisition, with themanufacturing sector claiming the lion’sshare. Expenditure on the acquisition of in-vestments in 1998 was more than half asmuch again as in the previous year and six-and-a-half times as high as the very low levelof 1995. The stock of debtors likewise record-ed significant growth, with the accent onshort-term debtors owed by affiliated enter-
prises.
Balance sheet trends and key balance
sheet ratios
At 5%, the adjusted balance sheet total
6ex-
panded in 1998 more strongly than it haddone since 1991. The growth of total assetsand liabilities thereby contrasted sharply withthe rather moderate development of businessactivity. The balance sheet total expanded dis-proportionately strongly in individual manu-facturing industries and in the wholesale andretail trade sector. In most other industriestotal assets and total liabilities grew muchmore weakly, while the construction sectorexperienced another contraction of the bal-ance sheet total.
The growth of the assets side of the balance
sheet was fuelled in part by a marked in-crease in non-financial assets, which acceler-ated from + 2% in 1997 to + 3
12%. The
stock of financial assets grew even faster(+ 6
12%) after having already expanded at
the quite dynamic rate of 4% in the previousyear. A notable development was the increaseof 13
12% in participating interests, whose
share of total assets rose to 12% as a result;at the end of the eighties its weight had beenmerely 7%. The shares in the individual in-dustries range from 2

sector, in which small and medium-sized

42enterprises predominate, to 1912% in the
energy, gas and water supply sector, which isdominated by very large enterprises – notleast owing to the sector’s higher capital in-tensity. In the manufacturing sector partici-pating interests made up 16% of total assets,which was near the top of the range. In linewith the growth of participating interests,debtors (and creditors) in respect of affiliatedenterprises have also increased significantlyover the past few years. The ratio of aggre-gate financial assets to total assets rose fur-ther in 1998 to 52
12%.
In order to finance this dynamic expansion of
assets, firms increased their own funds at theabove-average rate of 7
12%. A key precondi-
tion for this was the capital markets’ deepcapacity to absorb new equity issues. Theown funds ratio rose by
12percentage point
to 1812%; consequently, the provision with
liable capital regained the level achieved atthe end of the eighties. The trend describedhere was evident in all the sectors covered bythe analysis, albeit to differing degrees.
The own funds ratio was nevertheless rela-
tively low by international standards. How-ever, the figure should not be taken at facevalue, not least because it is advantageous(for liability and tax reasons) for partners andsole proprietors in Germany to assign assetsto their private sphere, as a result of whichthe amount of capital formally assigned tothe enterprise tends to be artificially low. Ger-man incorporated enterprises display quitehealthy financing structures on average. It isalso important in this respect to bear in mindthe relatively large weight of provisions onEnterprises’ balance sheet*

43the liabilities side. For the most part they are
available to the enterprise as long-term liabil-ities which are not subject to any interest raterisk or credit withdrawal risk and to that ex-tent are quasi-own funds. This applies espe-cially to provisions for pensions, which sincethe mid-nineties have maintained an un-changed share of around 9% in the balancesheet total.
Other provisions, which serve different pur-
poses than provisions for company pensions,have lost some of their significance in thepast few years; even so, in 1998 they stillamounted to 12
12% of total liabilities. This
decrease is due in part to more restrictive taxlegislation. Another possible cause is that list-ed enterprises, in particular, are now increas-ingly seeking to make their balance sheetmore transparent as they attach greater sig-nificance to the concept of shareholder value,which means that they have less desire tobuild up hidden reserves in the form of provi-sions.
The improvement in the financing position of
west German enterprises in 1998 is reflectedinter alia in the fact that the share of long-
term liabilities to total fixed assets rose fur-ther to 109
12%, the highest level since
1991. The short-term financing situation waslikewise unproblematical. The coverage ratioof liquidities plus short-term debtors to short-term creditors was 82
12%; going back over
quite a long period, such a high ratio hasbeen reached only once – in 1997. This posi-tive picture is further supported by the factthat the ratio of internally generated funds(cash flow) to borrowed funds stood at 13%Ratios relating to enterprises’ assets

44in the year under review, which matched the
rather high level achieved in 1997.
Despite the worsening of the economic out-
look in the later part of 1998, the profitabilityand financing of west German enterprises de-veloped favourably on balance. If the evengreater improvements recorded in 1997 areadditionally taken into account, it can be saidthat the negative consequences of the reces-sion in the year 1993 and of the further set-back in 1996 have now been overcome. At
the moment it is too early to tell whether thistrend persisted in 1999. Owing to the weak-ening of economic momentum in the secondhalf of 1998 and in the first half of 1999, cor-porate profitability suffered a temporary de-terioration – according to the national ac-counts data – which is also likely to have af-fected firms’ profit and loss account figuresfor the 1999 financial year.

55German balance of
payments in 1999Germany’s economic and financial rela-
tionships with non-residents weremarked by far-reaching changes lastyear. Firstly, new monetary policy con-ditions were established as a result ofthe changeover to monetary unionand the introduction of the euro, andthese have left their mark, especially inthe case of cross-border financial trans-actions. The outcome was that the Ger-man financial system acted as a majorchannel for capital flowing into theother euro-area countries from out-side. Secondly, the external conditionsconfronting German exporters im-proved on a lasting basis owing to therecovery of the world economy fromthe consequences of the crisis in Asiaand thereby provided a new stimulusto the domestic economy. Real importsgrew only moderately in 1999. Owingto the dramatic rise in the price of oilimports, however, the value of importswas inflated to such an extent thatGermany’s trade surplus was smallerthan in 1998, despite the country’s re-markable export achievement. Givenlarger deficits on both services and in-vestment income, the deficit on Ger-many’s current account rose to 519
12
billion in 1999 compared with one
equivalent to 54 billion in 1998. These
developments in cross-border currentand financial transactions will be ana-lysed in detail below.

56Current account
Following the distinct downturn in exports as
a result of the crises in the emerging marketsin South-East Asia, German exports experi-enced a discernible revival in the course of1999. In the final quarter of last year thevalue of German exports of goods was al-ready exceeding its corresponding 1998 levelby 10% whereas in the first quarter of 1999the figure had still been almost 1
12%b e l o w
that in the corresponding period of the previ-ous year. Calculated at current prices over theyear as a whole, German exports rose by justunder 4%. At 4%, the increase in volume isjust as great.
1This means that Germany par-
ticipated substantially in the real growth inworld trade last year.
The revival in German exports was triggered
by sales to non-European export marketsonce the situation in the crisis regions in Asiahad stabilised and the markets had begun toexpand again. Germany’s export business alsoreceived considerable stimuli from the robustand rapid economic growth in the UnitedStates, especially as the strength of the USdollar provided German exporters – and othersuppliers in the euro area – with relatively fa-vourable competitive conditions on the USmarket. As a result, German exports to theUnited States rose by 12
12% in 1999; their
share of total German exports therefore roseto just over 10% compared with just under9
12% in 1998. Later in the year the pattern
of exports changed in favour of the marketsof the other euro-area countries followingthe significant cyclical upturn there in thesummer. At 4%, however, the annual growthrate of exports to the other euro-area coun-
tries was only average. Even so, given thelarge share which the euro-area countrieshave in Germany’s total exports (just over40%), they had a major influence on theoverall result.Seasonally adjusted

57Almost all economic sectors gradually bene-
fited from the improved selling conditionsabroad. The German car industry was one ofthe first to do so. According to (still) incom-plete data, it increased its export sales by3
12% in 1999 and therefore accounted for
just under one-fifth of total German exportturnover. By contrast, suppliers of capitalgoods in the narrower sense of the term, e.g.electrical and mechanical engineering prod-ucts, did not achieve sizeable increases in ex-port sales until the second half of the year. Ex-ports of basic and producer goods developedsomewhat less favourably, recording a slightlylower value in the year under review thanthey had done in the previous year (– 1
12%).
However, the – in some cases appreciable –fall in prices played a role here; at all events,average export values for this category ofgoods declined by 4
12% in 1999 compared
with a year earlier. The consumer goods in-dustry did not succeed in regaining the previ-ous year’s export level either.
German imports of goods rose less strongly
than exports. In volume, the rise was no morethan just over 3
12%. Evidently the stocks
that had been built up in 1998 as a result ofthe decline in energy and raw material pricesat the time had led to correspondingly smallerpurchases of raw materials and primary prod-ucts from abroad. For example, imports ofcrude oil were just over 4% down in volumeon the previous year. The sluggish recovery indomestic demand probably also had a damp-ening effect on imports. In any case, the vol-ume of imports, excluding energy imports, inthe manufacturing sector did not rise furtherin 1999.Regional breakdown of foreign trade

58By contrast, total nominal imports increased
sharply and, on a year-on-year basis, ex-ceeded the 1998 level by just over 4
12%.
Nevertheless, the rise in the course of 1999was actually considerably faster. The nominalimport bill in the final quarter of 1999 was11% higher than a year earlier. Higher importprices accounted for approximately one-halfof this. To a large extent this was due to thesignificant increase in the price of petroleum,which was accentuated further in terms ofthe domestic currency owing to the appreci-ation of the US dollar against the euro. Thus,the price of crude oil at the end of last yearwas just over two and a half times above thelevel a year earlier.
As a result of the sharp increase in oil prices,
the value of German imports from the OPECcountries again rose particularly steeply in1999 (12%) whereas in 1998 it had declinedby almost one-fifth. Large nominal growthrates were also recorded in imports from thecentral and eastern European countries intransition (10
12%). These countries evidently
enjoyed a special advantage owing to theirclose business ties with Germany and, more-over, are likewise major raw material suppliersto Germany. Much of the rise in imports fromthe United States (4%), by contrast, canprobably be explained by the exchange-rate-related increases in import prices in terms ofthe Deutsche Mark or the euro. In the case ofthe United Kingdom (from which Germanyimported 5% more) it was not only the ap-preciation of the pound but arguably also therelatively large proportion of energy sourceswhich Germany imports from that countrythat played a role.

59man imports from other euro-area countries
hardly changed in annual terms.
The deterioration in the terms of trade as a
result of higher energy and raw materialprices in the course of the year ultimately ledto a somewhat smaller German trade surplus(just under 364 billion) in 1999 than in 1998
despite the distinct revival in exports.
The service transactions with non-residents
were also a detrimental factor in the Germanexternal balance in net terms. Here the deficitrose by just over 36 billion to just under 341
billion. The steepest rises in expenditure oc-curred in the case of foreign computer ser-vices, engineering and other technical ser-vices, publicity and trade fairs as well as thefilm industry. Furthermore, the income frommilitary bases declined further as a result ofthe reduced presence of troops on Germansoil. Service transactions excluding foreigntravel ran a deficit of 311 billion, which was
almost 35
12billion greater than in 1998.
In contrast to past trends, when foreign
travel, in particular, had resulted in growingdeficits on Germany’s services account, theforeign travel account, with a deficit of justunder 330 billion, remained practically the
same as in 1998 ( 329 billion). Spain, Portugal
and Greece, in particular, again enjoyedgrowing popularity as tourist destinationswhereas expenditure by German travellerswas slightly less in Italy, France and Austria.Long-haul destinations, notably the UnitedStates, which were previously in great de-mand, have probably become somewhat lessattractive as a result of the appreciation ofthe dollar. Although German tourists and
business travellers raised their nominal ex-penditure in these countries slightly in euroterms, they did so to a much lesser extentthan would have been necessary, given theappreciation of the dollar, to maintain theirlevel of expenditure in real terms. Turkey in-curred losses of as much as one-third approxi-mately.
Total factor payments between residents and
non-residents likewise ran a larger deficit in1999; this amounted to 312 billion com-
pared with just under 36 billion a year earlier.
While the balance on cross-border factor in-come showed a more or less unchanged def-icit of 31 billion, the increased expenditure
was concentrated on investment income pay-ments, which incurred a deficit of 311 billion,
i.e.36 billion more than in the previous year.
In particular, interest payments on loansraised by German banks abroad rose sharplyafter the credit institutions had significantlyincreased their (unsecuritised) external liabil-ities in 1998 and at the beginning of 1999.Net interest payments in 1999 on loans raisedabroad and on deposits received from abroadamounted to just under 31 billion whereas in
1998 there had been net receipts of almost33
12billion from the corresponding external
assets. By contrast, net investment incomearising from security portfolios largely stabil-ised ( 312 billion) as German investors had in-
vested large sums in foreign paper in 1998and 1999 and interest and dividend incomehad already increased for that reason alone.On the receipts side, the appreciation of theUS dollar and the interest rate advantage ofdollar assets also had a stabilising effect asTrade balance

60the proportion of German external assets de-
nominated in US dollars is relatively high. Bycontrast, the net income of German enter-prises from their outward direct investmentdeclined more sharply.
The traditionally large German deficit on in-
visible transactions with non-residents de-clined slightly last year, namely by 31
12billion
to just over 32512billion. This was mainly
due to the regular net German payments tothe EU budget, which fell from 315 billion
(1998) to just under 313
12billion in the year
under review because the EU shares of Ger-man value-added tax revenue declined. Cur-rent transfers in the private sector were virtu-ally unchanged at 38
12billion. These trans-
fers include the remittances of foreign work-ers in Germany to their home countries andpensions and other maintenance payments tobeneficiaries living abroad.

61the leading US currency.2Monetary union has
ended the segmentation of the market intonational currency zones within the euro area.Even if uniform conditions have (still) notbeen realised in all sections of the euro-areacapital markets, differences in yields betweenthe financial markets in the euro area havenot been influenced by expected exchangerate movements and currency risks since theintroduction of the euro. Instead, they de-pend solely on the liquidity of the marketsand the financial standing of borrowers. Con-sequently, lenders and borrowers in the euroarea find themselves exposed to greater com-petition, which extends beyond nationalboundaries.
The new currency regime has brought notice-
able changes in the level and pattern ofcross-border capital flows. In the case of Ger-many, portfolio investment in other euro-areacountries became particularly more importantwhile, conversely, large amounts of capitalflowed into Germany from countries not par-ticipating in monetary union. Evidently Ger-many, as a financial centre, has taken on thefunction of a kind of turntable within theeuro area by attracting funds from outsidethe euro area and rerouting them to borrow-ers in other participating countries (see thenotes on page 62). Another striking fact hasbeen the rapid progress made in financiallyintegrating German and foreign enterprises.The trend towards globalisation, which hasbeen apparent for some years, was givenadded impetus from the improvement in theeconomic outlook during the year. The cross-border mergers and acquisitions were reflect-ed in the German financial account in theform of greater direct investment in both
directions.
Despite the increased investment of non-
residents in the German capital markets,there was a deficit of 312 billion on portfolio
investment in 1999. A year earlier Germanyhad received net capital inflows amounting tothe equivalent of 33
12billion. The turn-
around was due essentially to the remarkablystrong momentum with which German in-vestors have been internationalising and di-versifying their portfolios since the start ofmonetary union. Their net purchases of for-Net capital flows to and

62Germany’s share in euro-area financial transactions
With Germany’s entry into monetary union the analysis of
German financial transactions with the rest of the worldtook on a new dimension. While questions in connectionwith the exchange rate movements of the euro can nolonger be addressed using the national balances of pay-ments of the participating countries but, instead, onlythrough recourse to the balance of payments of the entireeuro area, regional considerations play a greater role thanhitherto in the analysis of capital flows to and from Ger-many.
At first sight the balances arising in the financial accounts
of Germany and of the euro area appear to differ only interms of the amount but not in terms of whether they arein surplus or in deficit. In 1999 net capital exports predomi-nated in both balance sheets; they amounted to 562
12bil-
lion for the euro area and 58 billion for Germany.1This
might prompt the immediate assumption that Germany ac-counts for about one-eighth of the net capital exportsfrom the euro area. If German financial transactions are ex-amined more closely, however, it becomes clear that thedeficit is due solely to the transactions within the euro area(minus 5131 billion). By contrast, a net sum of 5123 billion
accrued to residents through their transactions with busi-ness partners in non-euro-area countries. Consequently, ifGermany had been excluded, the net capital exports of theeuro area would have been much larger than shown. Evi-dently Germany played a key role last year in channellingfinancial flows within the euro area and between the euroarea and elsewhere: German financial markets received(net) inflows of funds from outside the euro area; at thesame time German investors provided players in othereuro-area countries with substantial funds; in turn, theseplayers invested very heavily in non-euro-area countries.
In 1999 this pattern in regional capital flows – net capital
imports into Germany from non-euro-area countries andexports from Germany into other euro-area countries – canbe seen in both portfolio investment and in unsecuritisedcredit transactions. Capital flowed in the opposite directiononly in the case of direct investment: German enterprisesacquired investible funds from other euro-area countrieswhereas these enterprises, in turn, invested heavily outsidethe euro area (see the chart on page 63).
2
The present analysis of the financial flows within the euroarea and to and from non-euro-area countries is based onthe balance of payments data for the euro area and on theregional statistics on German financial transactions. From amethodological point of view, the analysis is “flawed” inthat the recorded data on German financial transactions
with non-euro-area countries are not fully consistent withthe theoretical construct of a “German component” withinthe euro-area balance of payments. The reason is that, ow-ing to portfolio investment in the secondary market, it isnot possible to identify clear-cut national components inthe euro-area balance of payments.
3However, that does
not detract from the essential truth of the aforementionedcomments; on the contrary, they are supported by a some-what different approach which is based on the gross euro-area capital flows to and from non-euro-area residentsand which tries to ascertain what share German playershave in this. Germany’s 29
12% contribution to M3, which
is also roughly in line with its economic weight within theeuro area, is used as a yardstick.
4Owing to the aforemen-
tioned problems in accurately recording purchases of euro-area securities by non-euro-area residents, the analysismust be restricted to selected items (see the table onpage 64).
Economic agents from Germany had a 20% share in euro-
area portfolio investment in non-euro-area countries,which was relatively small in terms of the reference vari-able mentioned; this applies to both shares and bonds. Inthe case of unsecuritised loans granted to borrowers out-side the euro area German creditors compared with thosefrom other euro-area countries actually proved to be evenmore restrained. Their modest 12
12% share was due first
and foremost to the fact that, in contrast to their counter-parts in other euro-area countries, German enterprises andindividuals substantially reduced their claims on borrowersoutside the single currency area, especially as a result ofthe reduction in bank balances abroad. By contrast, Ger-man credit institutions participated quite considerably inthe credit transactions of the MFIs domiciled in the euroarea (excluding the Eurosystem) with non-euro-area coun-tries. Thus, more than 60% of the euro area’s inflows ofunsecuritised funds accrued to German institutions; at583
12billion, these funds accounted for quite a consider-
able share of the euro area’s financial transactions in termsof value, too. This ultimately suggests that the Germanbanking system played a key role in the channelling offinancial resources back into the euro area.
5
Furthermore, German enterprises had a disproportionatelylarge share of the euro area’s direct investment in non-euro-area countries last year. German enterprises ac-counted for 40% of outward investment and more thanone-quarter of inward investment.
1In contrast to the data in the table on page • these fig-
ures on the financial transactions include the changes inmonetary reserves in each case. — 2The regional break-
down can sometimes pose problems, especially in the caseof portfolio investment. This applies, for example, whenbuy or sell orders from residents in other euro-area coun-tries are placed in the German market via financial centresin non-euro-area countries, e.g. London. In the systemused for recording balance of payments statistics thesetransactions would be allocated to the United Kingdom asthe first known counterparty. — 3If, for example, a bank
in the United Kingdom acquires a German security and sellsit to a French investor, the two transactions must, in princi-ple, cancel each other out in the euro-area balance of pay-ments. To achieve this when the euro-area balance of pay-ments is being drawn up the second transaction is “trans-ferred” from the assets side of the (French) securities
account to the liabilities side (as the sale of a euro-areasecurity by a non-euro-area resident). As a result of suchsecondary market transactions, a completely accuratepicture of portfolio transactions with non-euro-area coun-tries can only be obtained for the euro area as a whole. —4Germany’s share of the euro area’s nominal GDP
amounted to just under 33% in 1998. Germany’s share ofthe ECB’s capital is of a similar magnitude if it is measuredin terms of the total share of the 11 central banksparticipating in the Eurosystem (approximately 31%). —5For the role played by German banks in cross-border

63eign securities amounted to 317612billion.
That was more than their total net purchasesin the seven years between 1990 and 1996and represented a growth rate of 39% over1998.
Demand for foreign bonds and notes rose
particularly strongly last year, at 393 billion
(1998: 356 billion). As a result of the confus-
ing exchange rate situation over lengthyperiods in 1999, however, German residents– essentially banks and institutional invest-ors – were hesitant about running exchangerate risks when purchasing foreign bonds.Euro-denominated bonds and notes account-ed for 94% of those purchased. Most (ap-proximately 370 billion) were securities is-
sued by borrowers in other euro-area coun-tries. In the case of long-term governmentbonds these offered yields that were about
20 basis points higher on average than (Ger-man) Federal bonds. In addition, German in-vestors acquired euro-denominated bondsand notes, worth approximately 320 billion,
that were issued by borrowers domiciled out-side the euro area. Owing to the extendedcurrency area, this category of paper is com-parable with the former foreign DeutscheMark bonds. Many non-euro-area residentsevidently took advantage of the lower yield inthe euro area to borrow in euro and foundbuyers for their paper in Germany owing tothe interest mark-up. By contrast, German in-vestors avoided foreign currency bonds forthe most part even though long-term paperdenominated in, say, US dollars and poundssterling was offering decidedly higher yieldsthroughout the year than corresponding euro

on the international equity markets madeequities look more attractive than foreign cur-rency bonds, especially as the price of thesebonds was tending to fall as a result of thesharp rise in interest rates in the UnitedStates. At all events, German residents in-creased their investment in foreign equitiesby366
12billion compared with an increase
of358 billion in 1998. A large part of these
equity purchases abroad probably took placethrough investment funds. This is at least sug-gested by the fact that particularly thosefunds which invest partly or exclusively inequities recorded large inflows of capital.German savers subscribed not only to certifi-cates of German investment companies but
also again, and somewhat more intensively,to certificates of foreign investment com-panies whose range of products evidentlymet the wishes of customers particularly well.At314 billion, appreciably more funds
flowed into investment fund certificates thanin previous years. This amount was exceededonly once – in 1992 in connection with thedebate on withholding tax.
The extent to which the cross-border diversifi-
cation strategies of internationally operatinginvestors have augmented capital flows couldbe seen in 1999 not least in the fact thatboth sides of Germany’s securities account in-creased sharply. Parallel to the increase inGerman investment abroad, for example,non-residents invested, at 3164
12billion, just
over 26% more in German securities thanin 1998. About one-half of the investedamount, approximately 384
12billion, flowed
into the German bond market. In relativeterms, however, bonds were not in such greatdemand from investors as in earlier years.This may have been due to the difficult mar-ket situation because Germany, too, was af-fected by the “imported” interest rate in-creases. Even so, another relevant factor wasthat (German) Federal bonds, which had pre-viously been particularly popular with foreigninvestors and which determine the loweryield limit in the capital market within theeuro area, were much less in demand onceexchange rate risks had disappeared in theeuro area than they had been in, for example,the previous two years. Non-residents pur-chased public bonds worth a total of 326 bil-

65sued paper amounted to 35812billion. Bank
bonds, which predominate in the latter cat-egory, not only produce a somewhat higheryield than Federal bonds; they often havespecial features which are specifically tailoredto meet the needs of potential investors. It isalso worth noting in this connection that in1999 not only did non-residents’ net pur-chases of Federal bonds decline but also thecross-border transaction volume (whereasforeign transactions in private bonds in-creased significantly at the same time). Evi-dently the benchmark function which Federalbonds have in the interest rate range of theeuro area and the role as a hedging instru-ment which they have through the Bundfuture were not associated with an increasein cross-border trade in this paper last year.Incidentally, the same picture emerges withrespect to stock market turnover in publicbonds in Germany.
It is possible that, in addition to interest rate
uncertainty, the year 2000 problem also ad-versely affected the bond market last yearand prompted non-residents to increase theirshorter-term investment. This is supported bythe fact that foreign purchases of moneymarket paper in Germany rose particularlysharply in the year under review, namely from36
12billion in 1998 to 34612billion in
1999. This means that non-residents appearto have taken up almost all of the new issuesof this paper. According to the available stat-istics, these were mainly non-euro-area in-vestors.

Although, at 32712billion, non-residents in-
vested distinctly less in the German equitymarket in 1999 than in the previous year
(35112billion), the comparison with the pre-
vious year is distorted in that the 1998 resulthad been considerably influenced by thetransfer of equities to non-residents in con-DM

66nection with a major corporate merger. If this
special factor is eliminated, non-residents’purchases of German shares declined onlyslightly. Foreign investment may have beencurbed by the fact that in the first half of1999 the price trend in the German equitymarket was slower than trends on otherstock markets. When German shares beganto “catch up” towards the end of the year,however, foreign investors, too, showed re-newed interest in German equities. Theplanned changes to tax legislation certainlyalso played a part in this. One of thesechanges provides for the tax exemption ofprofits made by corporations from the sale ofparticipating interests in other enterprises.
As in portfolio investment, funds were ex-
ported through direct investment. At 343
12
billion, however, net capital exports were sig-
nificantly lower than in 1998 ( 363 billion).
This net figure is not such a good illustrationof the sustained momentum in intra-groupfinancial flows, which were encouraged notleast by the growing spate of mergers andacquisitions involving globally oriented enter-prises, as the gross flows. For example, Ger-man enterprises invested 393 billion abroad
last year. This was even more than the (for-mer) record of 382 billion which had been
reached in 1998 and which had been largelydue to a major merger. The four largest mer-gers in which German investors participatedlast year contributed, alone, approximately350 billion to Germany’s total outward directFinancial transactions

67investment.4Most of the cross-border acqui-
sitions of participating interests were con-fined to only a few economic sectors. Fromthe German point of view, mergers and ac-quisitions in the telecommunications andfinancial sectors were the most significant in1999. The most important host countries forGerman direct investment abroad were theUnited Kingdom and the United States,which accounted for 45% and 23%, re-spectively.
Not only German enterprises invested heavily
abroad in 1999. The funds accruing to Ger-man firms through non-residents’ direct in-vestment in Germany were also significantlygreater than in the previous year. At 349 bil-
lion, they received almost as much in foreignfunds in 1999 as in the other years of thedecade put together. The main reason for thesudden increase was a merger in the chemicalindustry, in the course of which the newly es-tablished enterprise located its domicileabroad and acquired the majority stake in theGerman enterprise. Apart from that transac-tion, the acquisition of participating interestsby foreign enterprises played a comparativelyminor role in Germany. By contrast, thecredits which German branches receivedfrom their foreign proprietors were, at 328
billion, more significant in terms of theamount. These were partly short-term fundswhich were used for intra-group liquiditymanagement. Borrowing by holding com-panies also played a role although these loanswere not associated with the actual provisionof funds.
5Consequently, the overall rise in in-
ward direct investment provides little indica-tion of foreign investors’ present assessmentof the quality of Germany as a place for locat-
ing their operations.Host countries of German

4In terms of German enterprises’ total acquisition of par-
ticipating interests abroad (i.e. excluding reinvested earn-
ings and intra-group credit operations), these large trans-
actions alone accounted for two-thirds of the total.
5Evidently foreign proprietors are integrating their Ger-
man subsidiaries to a greater extent into (German) hold-
ing companies, which, for their part, are financed mostly
by loans from the parent company. This is reflected in the
balance of payments statistics in liquidations of equity
capital and increasing direct investment loans.Foreign direct

68Part of the inflows of funds arising from port-
folio investment and direct investment wasoffset within the financial account by unse-curitised credit transactions in 1999. Germanenterprises and individuals, in particular, im-ported comparatively large amounts of cap-ital (337 billion). In doing so, they sharply de-
pleted their short-term bank balances abroad,on the one hand; on the other hand, theyalso increased their foreign short-term loans.Both trends are likely to be associated notleast with entry into monetary union. For ex-ample, the uniform minimum reserve regula-tions in the euro area presumably enabledGerman banks to offer more attractive inter-est rate conditions. Another possible factor isthat the disappearance of exchange rate risksand the convergence of interest rate levels inthe euro area encouraged German enter-prises to borrow in partner countries. It isevident, however, that some of the loansraised abroad were also in connection withthe financing of the takeovers mentionedabove.
In contrast to the activities of enterprises and
individuals, the cross-border financial transac-tions of public authorities resulted in net ex-ports of capital amounting to 33
12billion.
Although both the Federal Government andthe social security funds reduced the balancesthey hold with foreign banks, the relativelylarge repayments on loans previously takenup abroad had a larger net effect. Transac-tions involving borrowers’ notes issued by theFederal and Länder governments played a de-cisive part here.The unsecuritised foreign operations of the
entire banking system practically cancelledout in 1999. If they are considered separately,however, the credit institutions and the Bun-desbank (with its external assets that do notcount towards the foreign reserves) recordedexternal positions which moved in oppositedirections. German banks acquired foreignfunds amounting to 350
12billion net, a de-
velopment which was reflected in a sharp risein their short-term liabilities. By contrast, thebanks’ long-term operations resulted in netlending to non-residents.
In contrast to the credit institutions, the Bun-
desbank recorded a rise in its net externalassets – excluding foreign reserves – in 1999.Its external assets increased by 349
12billion.
This was essentially due to positive balancesvis-à-vis other central banks, which arose inthe course of settlements in the TARGET pay-ment system and are recorded as capital ex-ports in the credit transactions account. An-other factor was a claim of just over 312 bil-
lion on the ECB, which arose at the start ofmonetary union as a counterpart to the statu-torily prescribed transfer of foreign reservesto the ECB.
This transfer of part of Germany’s gold and
foreign currency holdings is also a major rea-son for the transaction-related decline of312
12billion in the foreign reserves shown in
the balance of payments. In the foreign re-serves shown in the balance sheet, however,this decline is almost completely offset byholding gains. In the course of 1999 both thegold price (in euro) and the exchange rates ofthe US dollar and the special drawing rightsCredit

69increased appreciably and resulted in net
write-ups in the external assets. Though con-siderable, these write-ups did not affectprofits. All in all, the Bundesbank’s foreign re-serves – valued at current market prices andexchange rates – amounted to 393 billion at
the end of 1999. This means that they werejust under 31 billion lower than in the Bun-
desbank’s opening balance sheet at the startof monetary union.
The changes in the short-term external assets
position of the entire banking system (creditinstitutions and Bundesbank) should, in prin-ciple, reflect the aggregate of all other cross-border balance of payments transactions. Thefact that this accounting identity does not al-ways hold in practice can be seen particularlyclearly in 1999. The “Balance of unclassifiabletransactions” amounted to 328 billion in
1999; it was therefore considerably largerthan in previous years (1998: the equivalentof – 31
12billion). It is not easy to find a clear
explanation for this reversal and for the dra-matic increase. In principle, problems, for ex-ample, in allocating transactions to the period
in which they actually occurred result in un-classifiable balances; however, these ought tocancel out over time. Recording gaps, too,could play a part. Where these are connectedto reporting exemptions, however, extremeshort-term changes in the balance of unclas-sifiable transactions are hardly plausible. Re-porting errors could also be a reason for thediscrepancies observed. For example, errors incurrency designations are conceivable here.As a result of the possibility of submittingstatistical reports for the balance of paymentseither in Deutsche Mark or in euro since thebeginning of 1999 and of the changes to thestatistical methodology, such inaccuraciesmay well have arisen, especially at the start ofmonetary union. Regardless of the actual rea-sons, the plus sign prefixed to the balance ofunclassifiable transactions in the German bal-ance of payments shows that in 1999 eitherthe net payments shown in the current andfinancial accounts are too high or the incom-ing payments are too low.
