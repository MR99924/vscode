Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The German economy continues to move on 
an upward path. Moreover, the previously re -
ported growth rates of gross domestic product 
(GDP) for the third and fourth quarters of 2016 
have probably understated the cyclical trend. In 
any case, the estimated number of persons in 
work has now undergone a significant upward 
revision for the second half of 2016. A key pillar 
of economic growth is currently industry, which 
is benefiting from brisk demand within Ger -
many and from abroad. The contraction in out -
put in December due to holidays was offset in 
January, as expected. The weak volume of new 
orders at the beginning of the year should be 
seen in the light of the exceptionally strong in -
flow of orders in the final quarter of 2016. The 
distinctly brighter sentiment in the manufactur -
ing sector of late suggests this is the case. This 
includes export expectations. By contrast, there 
was recently a deterioration in construction 
output against the backdrop of the cold wea -
ther in January.
Industry
After seasonal adjustment, German industrial 
output recorded a very sharp month- on- month 
rise of 3¾% in January 2017, more than com -
pensating for the slump in December. Follow -
ing the cutback in production in the previous 
month, which was likely to have been due 
chiefly to plant shutdowns between Christmas 
and the New Year, motor vehicle manufactur -
ers, in particular, stepped up their output quite 
significantly. Similarly, in comparison with the 
last quarter of 2016, industrial output recorded 
a steep rise of 2% in January. The greatest in -
crease in output was seen among producers of 
capital goods (+3%). Manufacturers of inter -
mediate goods also reported a fairly substantial development (+1¼%). By contrast, consumer 
goods production recorded significantly less 
growth (+¾%).
In January, new industrial orders recorded an 
exceptionally steep decline of 7¼% in season -
ally adjusted terms. This also represented a very 
strong contraction compared with the previous 
quarter (-5¼%). The turnaround in the place -
ment of domestic orders was particularly strik -
ing. The total volume of new orders fell by 7% 
and in the automotive sector by as much as 
11¾%. However, German industry also had to 
cope with severe cuts in new orders from the 
euro area (-2¾%) and non- euro- area countries 
(-4¾%). That said, the decline is to be seen in 
the light of the very strong growth rate in the 
fourth quarter of 2016, the upbeat sentiment 
in the manufacturing sector, the high level of 
capacity utilisation and the recent high volatility 
of new orders. Furthermore, excluding large 
orders, the drop was 3%, which, although still 
substantial, was no longer quite so significant. 
Overall, the sharp decline in orders in January is 
therefore still no cause for concern. Instead, in -
dustrial output is likely to contribute distinctly 
to GDP growth in the first quarter of the cur -
rent year.
Industrial sales, much like output, rose very 
sharply in January on the month (+3¾% after 
seasonal adjustment). There was also a steep 
increase of 2½% compared with the final quar -
ter of 2016. Manufacturers of capital goods re -
corded the strongest pick- up in sales (+3¾%), 
although the producers of intermediate (+1¼%) 
and consumer goods (+1¾%) expanded their 
turnover substantially, too. In regional terms, 
German industrial enterprises benefited, in par -
ticular, from the dynamic increase in sales in 
the euro- area countries. In line with this, nom -
inal exports of goods in January also posted a 
major rise on the month (+2¾%). They were 
up by a fairly strong 2% from the final quarter 
of 2016. In real terms, however, the increase German econ-
omy likely to have grown more strongly at beginning of year

was distinctly lower, at 1%. Even stronger 
growth was recorded in January for the nom -
inal imports of goods, which rose by 3% on the 
month and 4¼% compared with the previous 
quarter. However, growth was only nearly half 
as high in real terms (+2%), because prices of 
imports went up at a faster pace, mainly on the 
back of higher prices for crude oil.
Construction
In January, construction output continued its 
decline of the previous month and contracted 
significantly by 1¼% on the December level in 
seasonally adjusted terms. This was probably 
due to the cold weather in January. Construc -
tion output in January was thus substantially 
below the level of the final quarter of last year 
(-2½%). The fairly significant decline in the 
main construction sector (-6%) was only partly 
offset by the positive development in the finish -
ing trades (+1¾%). The outlook for the con -
struction sector remains favourable overall, 
however. New orders, for example, increased 
considerably in the final quarter of 2016. Build -
ing permits in October and November –  the 
most recent period for which statistical infor -
mation is available – were also on a strong up -
ward trajectory compared with the third quar -
ter of 2016. Furthermore, the business climate 
in the construction sector remains positive, 
even if enterprises’ business expectations have 
deteriorated somewhat recently. As a result, 
the construction sector is likely to return to its 
growth path when weather conditions are 
more favourable.
Labour market
The situation on the labour market is even 
more favourable than reported in the past few 
months. After a data processing error by the 
Federal Employment Agency was remedied,

tions underwent a huge upward correction in Weather condi-

the second half of 2016. Significant adjust -
ments were also made to total employment.
The corrected data indicate that the number of 
persons in work in January 2017 was up by 
609,000, or 1.4%, on the same month last 
year. This is linked to increasingly stronger job 
growth over the course of 2016, which stands 
in stark contrast to the picture presented so far 
of subsiding labour market dynamics. Previous 
reports for December 2016 indicated growth 
over the previous year of only 0.5%. The cor -
rected estimates for employment subject to so -
cial security contributions are now available up 
to December 2016. Compared with the same 
month one year earlier, the increase of 735,000 
persons, or 2.4%, is now very substantial. In 
particular, vacant positions in a number of ser -
vices sectors with stable employment were re -
ported late. Furthermore, in addition to the 
construction sector, the manufacturing sector 
now also shows a positive trend in employ -
ment. In the fourth quarter, the number of per -
sons employed under a regular employment 
contract increased very strongly by a seasonally 
adjusted 83,000 per month on average. Ac -
cording to initial reports, there also appears to 
have been no further decline in the number of 
persons working exclusively in low- paid part-  
time jobs. Although leading employment indi -
cators, notably the Ifo employment barometer, 
the labour market barometer of the Institute 
for Employment Research (IAB) and the Federal 
Employment Agency’s BA-  X job index, have 
shown barely any improvement recently, they 
are at exceptionally high levels. Consequently, 
the coming months could likewise see a con -
siderable rise in job creation.
After seasonal adjustment, unemployment in 
February posted a further marked fall on the 
month. It was not affected by the data revision. 
There were 2.59 million persons registered as 
unemployed with the Federal Employment 
Agency. The unemployment rate was 5.9%, as 
in January. Compared with the same month 
one year earlier, 149,000 fewer persons were 
out of work and the unemployment rate was 0.3 percentage point lower. Total underemploy -
ment (excluding short- time work), which also 
includes persons taking part in labour market 
policy measures, was likewise down slightly at 
the beginning of the year. Prior to this, under -
employment using the Federal Employment 
Agency’s definition had actually increased in 
connection with measures to integrate refu -
gees into the German labour market. The peak 
has been reached here in the meantime, how -
ever. According to the IAB labour market bar -
ometer, registered unemployment could con -
tinue to fall slightly over the next few months.
Prices
In February, the price of crude oil stood at 
US$56½ per barrel of Brent. OPEC’s implemen -
tation of the production cuts announced in the 
autumn was probably one of the reasons the 
somewhat higher price level recorded in Janu -
ary and December was maintained. Prices were 
almost two- thirds up on the previous year, 
mainly as the decline in prices at the turn of 
2015-16 was no longer factored into the rele -
vant rate. Crude oil prices fell considerably in 
the first half of March, however. As this report 
went to press, the price of a barrel of Brent 
crude oil stood at US$52. The premium on 
crude oil futures was US$½ for deliveries six 
months and 12 months ahead.
Import and producer prices were moving up -
wards at the beginning of the year, too. Higher 
energy prices made only a small contribution to 
this. More importantly, the marked rise in prices 
for other goods continued. Overall, prices were 
up significantly on the year (import prices 
+6.0% and prices of manufactured goods 
+2.4%).
Consumer prices continued to climb slightly in 
February by a seasonally adjusted 0.2% (Har -
monised Index of Consumer Prices, HICP). The 
price of vegetables, in particular, rose very 
steeply due to weather conditions. On the 
other hand, there was a fairly marginal increase Highly dynamic

in the prices of other goods and services, in -
cluding rents, overall. A dampening effect was 
exerted by temporary reductions in prices of 
certain goods and services groups, such as 
clothing and package holidays, whose prices 
are generally very volatile. Overall, year- on- year 
inflation increased from +1.9% to +2.2% (like -
wise as measured by the national CPI). The rate 
excluding energy and food remained at just 
over +1%. Given the current underlying condi -
tions, headline inflation is likely to fluctuate 
around the 2% mark in the coming months, 
partly due to the different timing of Easter and 
Whitsun compared with last year.
Public finances1
Statutory health insurance 
scheme
According to preliminary data, the statutory 
health insurance (SHI) scheme – comprising the 
health insurance institutions and the health 
fund – finished 2016 with a surplus of €½ bil -
lion. This equates to a financial improvement of 
€4 billion compared with 2015. The health in -
surance institutions recorded a surplus of €1½ 
billion (following a deficit of €1 billion in the 
previous year). Given the fact that growth in 
spending on benefits was much weaker than 
forecast, last year’s rise in contribution rates 
was thus too high on average. The health fund, 
by contrast, posted a deficit of €1 billion. The 
budget was not balanced as planned because 
compulsory contributions, in particular, saw 
somewhat weaker development than the 
group of statutory health insurance estimators 
had expected.2 The deficit was therefore €1½ 
billion lower than in 2015, which was due, in 
particular, to the central government grant re -
turning to its standard level of €14 billion in 
2016. The health fund’s reserves consequently 
fell to €9 billion, while the health insurance in -
stitutions’ financial reserves increased to a total 
of €16 billion.3The health insurance institutions saw specific 
growth in revenue (5½%), which consists 
mainly of transfers from the health fund. After 
adjustment for the increased additional contri -
bution rate (by an average of 0.25 percentage 
point), revenue growth still stood at 4%, and 
was therefore almost as high as expenditure 
growth (4½%). Expenditure rose by 3½% for 
hospital treatment and by 4½% for remedies 
and therapeutic appliances. The agreed expan -
sions of benefits for hospital care only became 
noticeable in the final quarter, meaning that a 
more pronounced dynamic has been visible 
here over the course of the year. Spending on 
outpatient treatment (just over +4%) and for 
pharmaceuticals (+4%), which are also major 
expenditure items, experienced similarly strong 
growth. The latter were particularly driven by 
higher discounts on pharmaceuticals and de -
clining expenditure on the treatment of hepa -
titis C. All in all, the increase in spending on 
benefits came to 4%. The comparatively strong 
growth in administration costs (5½%) is not 
least linked to a significant interest- related in -
crease in pension provisions.
The health fund, which collects contributions in 
the first instance before transferring predeter -
mined amounts to the health insurance institu -
tions, posted an increase in revenue of 6½% in 
2016. Contribution receipts rose by just over 
5½% (+4% after adjustment for the increase in 
additional contributions). In light of the very 
encouraging development in employment sub -

1 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain a detailed description of 
public finance developments during the preceding quarter.
2 In addition, transfers from the health fund to the innov -
ation fund in 2016 were not initially taken into account by 
the group of statutory health insurance estimators.
3 Each statutory health insurance institution, as well as the 
health fund, is required to hold minimum reserves of one- 
quarter of a month’s average expenditure (sections 261 (2) 
and 271 (2) of the Social Security Code Book V). This cur -
rently corresponds to a sum of €4½ billion for the health 
insurance institutions and the health fund alike. The min -
imum requirements are therefore clearly exceeded on ag -
gregate.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

ing health insurance institution members saw 
an even more significant increase. However, 
following the strong mid-2016 pension adjust -
ment, the rise in pension contributions was 
close behind. By contrast, contribution receipts 
for the unemployed fell as a result of the con -
tinued favourable labour market situation and 
declining unemployment. The renewed raising 
of the central government grant to its standard 
amount resulted in additional revenue of €2½ 
billion. Total expenditure, which is essentially 
equivalent to transfers to the health insurance 
institutions, increased by just over 5½%.
A deficit is anticipated for the SHI scheme as a 
whole this year. The group of statutory health 
insurance estimators foresees a somewhat 
higher deficit for the health fund than in 2016. 
Although a balanced result is expected with re -
gard to the contributions collected and the 
risk- adjusted transfers to the health insurance 
institutions, the fund must transfer an add -
itional sum of €1½ billion to the health insur -
ance institutions this year, which is intended to 
enable an increase in additional contribution 
rates on average to be avoided as far as pos -
sible. Around €½ billion is also to be paid to 
the structural and innovation funds from the 
fund reserves. An increase of 4% is expected 
for contribution receipts, and the central gov -
ernment grant is set to rise by €½ billion to its 
new standard level of €14½ billion. On bal -
ance, the health fund’s reserves would be ex -
pected to fall to around €7 billion. However, 
this would not yet undercut the statutory min -
imum reserve.4
A balanced financial result was forecast for the 
health insurance institutions, taking into ac -
count the additional transfer from the health 
fund5 and a marginal rise in additional contri -
bution rates. Given that the data used as a 
starting point for 2016 were overstated by just 
over €½ billion, there is already a certain buffer 
here. Furthermore, it is possible that expend -
iture growth (+5%) has been overestimated, 
just as in previous years. Were this the case, the 
result would be even more favourable.The reserves of the health insurance institutions 
would then continue to grow. These already 
exceeded the minimum requirement by two 
and a half times (or €11½ billion) at the end of 
2016, and are distributed fairly heterogeneously 
among the individual health insurance institu -
tions. They are not intended to serve as capital 
cover for future increases in funding require -
ments, but rather to act as a safeguard against 
short-  term fluctuations. This allows cyclical 
fluctuations to be intercepted at the health 
fund level. To date, the additional contribution 
rate has evidently barely been used as an ac -
tion parameter in the competition between in -
stitutions. Rather, financially strong institutions, 
in particular, have broadly kept in line with the 
average additional contribution rate deter -Deficit expected

mined to be adequate by the Federal Ministry 
of Health. In view of inflated expenditure esti -
mates, this rate was apparently set rather gen -
erously of late, thus resulting in high reserves 
on aggregate. While certain safety margins for 
minimum reserve requirements are sensible, 
and the scope of an individual institution can -
not be immediately concluded from institu -
tional reserves on aggregate, the reserves ap -
pear to have become most extensive in the 
meantime. Although overall these are still 
below the upper limit of a month’s expend -
iture, it would be prudent for those health in -
surance institutions with high reserves to fur -
ther reduce their additional contribution rates 
to relieve the burden on their members. It 
would otherwise be expected that high re -
serves would reduce the incentive to limit costs 
and that further structural increases in expend -
iture would occur, ultimately making persist -
ently higher contribution rates essential.Public long- term care 
 insurance scheme
The public long- term care insurance scheme 
ended 2016 with a surplus of €1 billion in the 
core budget,6 which was €½ billion lower than 
the previous year’s result. The general reserves 
thus increased to €9 billion. In addition, almost 
€1½ billion was transferred as arranged to the 
long- term care provident fund, which recorded 
a balance of €2½ billion at the end of the year.
Total revenue in the core budget rose by 4½%. 
Contribution inflows from employment in -
creased substantially (+5%) against a backdrop 
of sustained favourable labour market develop -
ments, but contribution inflows from pensions 
were also up by almost 4½%, primarily due to 
the large adjustment in mid-2016. By contrast, Surplus in 2016

the growth in total expenditure was much 
steeper at 7%. This is primarily due to a sub -
stantial increase of 6½% in benefits in kind, the 
largest expenditure item. These were signifi -
cantly increased by the first Act to Strengthen 
Long- term Care (Pflegestärkungsgesetz I)  in 
2015, which, however, only took full effect 
after a certain delay, as was the case with pre -
vious expansions in benefits. Yet over the 
course of 2016, year- on- year growth rates con -
tinued to decline. Cash benefits, by contrast, 
displayed a countervailing trend throughout 
the year. An increase in expenditure of 5½% 
was recorded for the year as a whole, with a 
very steep rise in care allowance payments in 
the last quarter of 2016. However, the develop -
ment at year- end was evidently restricted to 
the long- term care insurance institutions. Due 
to the advance payment of care benefits, the 
higher benefit rates for the newly introduced 
care grades under the second Act to Strengthen 
Long- term Care (Pflegestärkungsgesetz II) , ef-
fective from 2017, were paid as early as De -
cember. Finally, spending on administration has 
also seen a very substantial increase at 12%. 
The affiliated long- term care insurance institu -
tions paid their health insurance institutions a 
lump sum for the reimbursement of administra -
tion costs, based on average spending on 
benefits and contribution receipts. Following 
sharply increased revenue and expenditure 
under the first Act to Strengthen Long- term 
Care in 2015, these lump sums were below the 
amounts actually due. In 2016, the lump sums 
were raised accordingly, as the amounts for 
2015 were paid retrospectively.
On 1 January 2017, the contribution rate was 
raised from 2.35% to 2.55% (plus an extra 
0.25% in each case for childless persons). Al -
though additional revenue of just over €2½ bil -
lion is anticipated as a result, the legislators do 
not expect this to be sufficient to cover the sig -
nificantly increased costs arising from the ex -
tensive widening of benefits, which was also 
implemented at the start of the year. In 2017, 
the public long- term care insurance scheme 
may, however, initially see a moderate surplus in light of what is likely to be a more gradual 
increase in spending on benefits. Nevertheless, 
in the coming years the financial situation is 
likely to deteriorate gradually. To begin with, 
the extensive core reserves formed in previous 
years will be available to offset deficits. Looking 
ahead, however, further increases in contribu -
tion rates resulting from demographic change 
are anticipated. From 2035 onwards, this trend 
is expected to weaken as the long- term care 
provident fund’s reserves built up by then are 
depleted.

suers’ holdings of their own debt securities, the 
outstanding volume of domestic bonds rose by 
a net €22.5 billion, after having contracted by 
€21.9 billion in December. The outstanding vol -
ume of foreign debt securities in the German 
market grew by €1.7 billion, which meant that 
the outstanding volume of domestic and for -
eign debt instruments in Germany increased by 
€24.2 billion on balance.
The public sector issued bonds totalling €5.9 
billion net in the reporting month, with central 
government expanding its capital market debt 
by €5.6 billion on balance. It issued mainly 
two- year Federal Treasury notes (Schätze) and 
30-year Federal bonds (Bunds) worth €5.1 bil -
lion and €1.6 billion respectively, while redeem -
ing ten- year Bunds in the amount of €2.1 bil -
lion. State governments issued bonds with a 
net value of €0.3 billion.
Resident credit institutions increased their cap -
ital market debt by €12.0 billion net in January, with debt securities issued by specialised credit 
institutions (€6.7 billion) and mortgage Pfand -
briefe (€3.0 billion) accounting for most of this 
growth. In addition, public Pfandbriefe worth 
€0.9 billion and other bank debt securities 
which can be structured flexibly amounting to 
€1.4 billion net were placed in the market.
German enterprises also significantly expanded 
their capital market debt in January (€4.6 bil -
lion). On balance, the new issues were primar -
ily short- term commercial paper and bonds 
with a maturity of more than one year.
The Deutsche Bundesbank, in particular, 
bought debt securities in January, adding a net 
€18.1 billion worth of paper to its portfolio 
under the Eurosystem’s asset purchase pro -
grammes. While domestic non- banks were like -
wise net purchasers, acquiring bonds totalling 
€10.0 billion, German credit institutions sold 
debt securities worth €7.4 billion net over the 
same period. The majority of these sales in -
volved domestic securities issued by the public 
sector. Non- resident investors acquired German 
bonds amounting to €3.5 billion net.
Equity market
In January 2017, domestic enterprises on bal -
ance raised hardly any fresh funds through pla -
cing new shares in the German equity market. 
Sales of foreign shares in Germany totalled 
€1.3 billion in the same period. Domestic non- 
banks and non- resident investors dominated 
the buyers’ side of the market, purchasing 
equities worth €0.8 billion and €0.7 billion net 
respectively. German credit institutions, by con -
trast, offloaded shares worth €0.2 billion net.

most investment (€5.2 billion). Real estate 
funds (€2.8 billion) and mixed securities funds 
(€2.7 billion) were also able to attract new sub -
scriptions, while equity funds sustained net 
outflows totalling €1.6 billion. Foreign mutual 
funds placed shares worth €8.5 billion in the

Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur -
plus of €12.8 billion in January 2017, which was 
€11.9 billion down on the level of the previous 
month. This result was driven primarily by the 
deterioration in the invisible current transac -
tions balance, an item which comprises ser -
vices as well as primary and secondary income, 
as well as by a drop in the goods account sur -
plus.
The January surplus in the goods account was 
€2.0 billion down on the month at €15.2 billion 
due to goods imports increasing at a faster 
pace than goods exports.
Invisible current transactions ran up a deficit of 
€2.3 billion in January, compared with a surplus 
of €7.6 billion one month earlier. This decline 
was due to poorer results in all three sub-  
accounts. The main factor in this turnaround 
was the €4.6 billion drop in net receipts in the 
primary income account to €5.8 billion. To a 
large extent, this was due to a normalisation of 
other income following payment in December 
2016 – as is standard practice at year’s end – of 
the bulk of agricultural subsidies under the EU 
budget. In the secondary income account, the 
deficit widened by €2.8 billion to €6.8 billion.

deficit of €1.3 billion. This was partly because 
the decline in receipts, primarily from IT ser -
vices, other business services and charges for 
the use of intellectual property, was stronger 
overall than the drop in expenditure, which 
contracted in those areas in particular. Further -
more, net expenditure on travel increased.
Events in the international financial markets in 
January were chiefly shaped by the growing 
prospect of a “hard Brexit”, the inauguration of 
the new US president and mounting expect -
ations that US interest rates will rise. It was 
against this backdrop that Germany’s cross-  
border portfolio investment generated net cap -
ital exports in the amount of €7.6 billion (after 
€22.4 billion in December). This result was 
driven in large part by purchases of foreign se -
curities by domestic investors (to the tune of 
€11.4 billion, compared with sales of €5.3 bil -
lion one month earlier). Their demand was par -
ticularly brisk for mutual fund shares (€8.5 bil -
lion), and they acquired both bonds (€1.4 bil -
lion) and shares (€1.2 billion) abroad. Non-  
resident securities investors likewise stepped up 
their exposures in Germany (€3.7 billion), hav -
ing reduced them substantially just one month 
earlier (€27.7 billion). This investor group fo -
cused on – primarily private – bonds (€9.0 bil -
lion) and offloaded money market paper (€5.4 
billion).
Direct investment, too, generated net capital 
exports in January of no less than €13.3 billion. 
In large part, this was due to domestic firms 
making new investments abroad (€15.7 billion). 
Of this amount, €9.3 billion was granted in the 
form of intra- group loans, with both credit is -
sued by domestic parents to subsidiaries abroad 
and cross- border facilities between affiliated 
enterprises playing a prominent role. A further 
€6.4 billion was provided in the form of equity capital investments abroad. Foreign enterprises 
likewise injected funds into their affiliates in 
Germany (€2.4 billion), with branches located 
abroad, in particular, providing credit to their 
parents in Germany, while trade credits gener -
ated capital outflows.
Other statistically recorded investment, which 
comprises loans and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment) as well as 
bank deposits and other assets, yielded rela -
tively small net capital imports of €1.3 billion in 
January. In this context, non-  banks accounted 
for net capital imports of €4.0 billion because 
the inflows of capital recorded by public au -
thorities (€5.1 billion) were greater than the 
outflows sustained by enterprises and house -
holds during the same period (€1.1 billion). 
Cross- border transactions by the banking sys -
tem, meanwhile, produced net capital exports 
in the amount of €2.7 billion. These can be at -
tributed to the outflows recorded at the Bun -
desbank (€56.2 billion), which originated pri -
marily from a rise in the Bank’s net claim on the 
TARGET2 large- value payment system (€41.4 
billion). Capital also left the country because 
foreign central banks scaled back their deposits 
at the Bundesbank (€13.5 billion). Transactions 
by credit institutions, on the other hand, gener -
ated net inflows of €53.5 billion, mainly on ac -
count of rising deposits by non- resident coun -
terparties. The rise in the TARGET2 balance and 
the increase in deposits at German banks are 
both probably associated with the Eurosystem’s 
asset purchases, because these operations 
have, in the past, often been settled with for -
eign counterparties linked to TARGET2 via the 
Bundesbank.

German balance of payments in 2016
The German economy’s current account surplus recorded a slight fall to 8¼% of nominal gross 
domestic product (GDP) in 2016. This drop in the annual average masks a stronger decline over 
the course of the year. In seasonally and calendar- adjusted terms, the surplus dwindled from 
8¾% of GDP in the first quarter of the year to 7½% in the fourth quarter. Assuming there is no 
trend reversal in relative prices, this means there is much to indicate that Germany’s current 
account surplus will recede markedly this year on average. In absolute terms, too, the strong 
expansion seen in the previous two years did not continue – at €261 billion, the balance remained 
virtually the same as in 2015. Looking at the sub- accounts, the goods trade surplus continued to 
grow. However, for the fourth consecutive year, this came about due to lower import prices. In 
value terms, this price effect is masking the volume decline in the trade in goods surplus. By con -
trast, the deficit in the services account increased further, and the surplus from investment income 
went down despite the renewed increase in net external assets.
One reason why the current account surplus did not expand any further in 2016 was the slight 
cutback in national savings, which had risen sharply in the two preceding years, in relation to 
GDP. This largely offset the decline in the investment ratio. The European Commission, which has 
found that Germany is experiencing an imbalance on account of its high current account surplus, 
recommends measures to reduce it. While it is true that the current account balance is the out -
come of numerous, largely private- sector decisions both at home and abroad and therefore can -
not be directly managed to any meaningful degree using macro policy tools, it is nonetheless 
worth examining whether and what adjustments to the framework conditions might be condu -
cive to stimulating private investment and how to efficiently cover any clearly identified shortfalls 
in government investment.
Germany’s financial account with the rest of the world last year was once again influenced by the 
low- interest- rate environment and the Eurosystem’s large- scale purchases of assets for monetary 
policy purposes. At €231½ billion, net capital exports were roughly as high as they were in 2015. 
Portfolio investment saw domestic investors shift their demand towards securities issued outside 
the euro area. In the opposite direction, foreign investors parted with large volumes of German 
debt securities, the bulk of which were purchased by the Bundesbank under the expanded asset 
purchase programme (APP). The Eurosystem’s asset purchases were also behind another sharp 
widening of the TARGET2 balance and thus of the Bundesbank’s net external position.
Direct investment, which tends to be more of a longer- term instrument, likewise registered net 
capital outflows. This was largely because German firms continued to build up their operations 
abroad on balance. Other investment, meanwhile, yielded net capital imports which were largely 
driven by inflows of funds at enterprises, households and monetary financial institutions.Deutsche Bundesbank

Current account
Underlying trends  
in the current account
At €261 billion in 2016, the German current ac -
count surplus remained virtually unchanged on 
the year. The growth in the surplus seen in the 
two preceding years did not continue. Meas -
ured in terms of nominal GDP , the surplus was 
even down by ¼  percentage point at 8¼%. 
However, it was still well above 6% of GDP , the 
threshold set by the European Commission 
under its macroeconomic imbalance proced -
ure, which it uses to monitor and correct im -balances. Accordingly, the European Semester 
Winter Package published by the European 
Commission at the beginning of this year in -
cludes conclusions that Germany is continuing 
to experience economic imbalances.1
While the current account surplus remained 
largely unchanged in absolute terms, there were 
contrasting developments in the individual sub-  
accounts. On the one hand, the goods account 
surplus continued to expand. As in the three 
preceding years, this sub- account was particu -
larly influenced by the decline in crude oil prices, 
which significantly dampened the total value of 
imported goods. On the other hand, there was 
a wider deficit in the services account and a con -
siderable drop in the surplus from cross- border 
investment income. The services sub- account 
saw expenditure on research and development, 
in particular, rise markedly. In addition, residents 
perceptibly increased their budgets for foreign 
travel. Turning to the primary income account, 
the surplus on investment income fell back con -
siderably despite the continued sharp increase in 
net external assets; the lower level of yields over -
all probably had a bearing on this. The trad -
itional deficit in the secondary income account 
remained broadly unchanged.
The global setting once again had an expan -
sionary effect on balance in 2016, primarily on 
account of the continued decline in the price of 
crude oil. A barrel of Brent crude cost just 
under US$46 on average in 2016 – one- seventh 
less than in 2015. This price has more than 
halved in comparison to the average for the 
period from 2011 to 2014. The cost of energy 
imports in 2016 was no more than just under 
€70 billion – one-  fifth, or almost €20 billion, 
down on 2015. By contrast, the exchange rate 
did not provide any additional expansionary 
stimuli, unlike in the previous year, even if the 
after- effects of the sharp depreciation in 2015 
probably continued to make themselves felt. Current account

On average, the euro remained broadly un -
changed against the US dollar in 2016, having 
shed one- sixth of its value in 2015. There was 
even an increase in the euro’s nominal effective 
exchange rate, mainly on the back of the cur -
rency’s strong appreciation against the pound 
sterling. Accordingly, this also eroded Germa -
ny’s price competitiveness somewhat. Com -
pared to other euro- area countries, this was a 
reflection of the different cyclical positions and, 
by association, the slightly stronger domestic 
price pressure in Germany.
Global trade continued to lose pace in 2016, 
however, according to data from the Inter -
national Monetary Fund (IMF). Coupled with 
the clearly waning expansionary effect of the 
euro’s depreciation in 2015, this significantly 
decelerated the pace of goods exports. Imports 
likewise rose more slowly despite the robust 
domestic demand, one contributing factor 
being the particularly muted growth in the very 
two demand variables with the largest direct 
and indirect import content, ie goods exports 
and investment in machinery and equipment. 
Even so, the increase in goods imports out -
stripped the growth in goods exports in real 
terms. The stronger decline in the prices of im -
ported goods, however, ended up inversing the 
ratio in nominal terms. On balance, the surplus 
in the goods account climbed by just over €10 
billion to €272 billion. The volume component, 
on the other hand, showed an equally- sized re -
duction in arithmetical terms.
From a regional perspective, there were no 
major changes in the current account surplus 
against the other countries of the euro area or 
against third countries. Expressed in terms of 
nominal GDP , the surplus against the euro area 
remained steady at almost 2%, while against 
non- euro-area countries, it came in at just 
under 6½% in the year under review. Germany 
widened its trade surplus with both regions, 
with the price effects generated by lower im -
port prices being the predominant factor in 
each case.Germany’s current account surplus fell back 
significantly over the course of 2016, the sea -
sonally and calendar- adjusted figure gradually 
contracting from 8¾% of GDP in the first two 
quarters to 8% in the third quarter and 7½% in 
the fourth. This was mainly due to the fact that 
the real terms of trade with the rest of the 
world, which had greatly improved in previous 
years, deteriorated in the course of 2016 and 
into 2017. Assuming there is no trend reversal 
in relative prices, this means there is much to 
indicate that Germany’s current account sur -
plus has peaked and will recede markedly dur -
ing this year.
Current account balance, 
 savings and investment
Germany’s current account surplus can also be 
analysed from the perspective of the invest -
ment and savings decisions made by domestic 
economic agents. This is because aggregate Trade in goods

net lending/net borrowing, which broadly cor -
responds to the current account balance, 
equates to the difference between savings and 
investment in the accounting framework of the 
national accounts.2 Viewed from this angle, the 
current account surplus did not increase any 
further in 2016 because aggregate savings, 
which had climbed sharply in the two preced -
ing years, were cut back slightly relative to GDP , 
largely offsetting the decline in the investment 
ratio.
Over the past few years, economic activity in 
Germany has been characterised by subdued 
domestic investment despite the robust up -
swing and, at the same time, strong growth in 
savings. These macroeconomic trends were 
driven notably by changes in the ratios of in -
vestment and savings at non- financial corpor -
ations and general government. Non- financial 
corporations have consistently reported a fi -
nancial surplus since 2002, with the exception 
of 2008, which at last count came to 3½% of 
GDP . This is probably not least a reflection of 
efforts to counter the significant undercapitali -
sation identified at the turn of the millennium 
among German enterprises. Public finances, 
meanwhile, were consolidated as the invest -
ment ratio remained largely steady, and what 
had been a marked deficit switched to a mod -
erate surplus. Households, on the other hand, have maintained relatively stable investment 
and savings ratios since the beginning of this 
decade.
Given Germany’s large current account surplus, 
the European Commission recommends both 
greater public investment as well as further 
measures aimed at boosting private sector in -
vestment or an improved balance between pri -
vate sector savings and investment.3 Specific -
ally, the Commission is calling for a reform of 
the services sector, where it considers invest -
ment to be particularly weak, even by inter -
national standards, and a reduction of the dis -
tortions caused by some corporate taxation 
features which it believes are hindering invest -
ment. It also notes that delayed investment in 
transport, energy and telecommunications in -
frastructure poses an obstacle to more dynamic 
private investment.
With regard to government investment, the 
Commission acknowledges that some progress 
has been made but believes that the pace must 
be stepped up and that the scope available 
under EU and national fiscal rules should be 
used to increase public investment. A good 
public infrastructure is undeniably important 
for sound economic development and loca -
tional quality. Germany probably does indeed 
have some catching up to do in some of these 
areas, even if quality standards here are still 
rated very highly by international standards. Ex -
penditure on this item has been budgeted to 
increase over the next few years, and, not least, 
the burden at the level of local government has 
been significantly eased. However, it is not a 
question here of spending resources as rapidly 
and comprehensively as possible, but, in par -
ticular, of efficiently exploring which needs 
exist and taking action where needed. With re -

structural surpluses are recommended in Ger -
many, not least because of the foreseeable 
demographic burdens it faces.4 At present, 
there is furthermore the question of whether 
an even more expansionary fiscal policy stance 
would be appropriate given the current eco -
nomic situation, and also whether capacity 
constraints in the construction sector might 
curtail any attempt to rapidly and very signifi -
cantly boost public sector construction invest -
ment.
Favourable interest rate conditions, by them -
selves, provide an insufficient basis for enter -
prises to substantially expand their production 
capacity. Instead, investment decisions hinge to 
a great extent on the returns that can be ex -
pected from the prevailing economic outlook, 
as well as on longer- term sales prospects. The 
underlying trend points to an upturn in German 
business investment in the near future, given 
that utilisation of aggregate production cap -
acity is now at a good level, and industrial ac -
tivity, in particular, picked up recently.
Non- financial corporations’ saving mirrored 
their investment activity over time. After re -
cording an average level of saving of just over 
9% of GDP in the 1990s, their savings ratio 
climbed to more than 11% over the last decade 
and has averaged 13% in the current decade. 
There is no single explanation for this increase. 
Rather, it arose from several factors. First, small 
and medium-  sized enterprises (SMEs), in par -
ticular, demonstrated a strong inclination to 
strengthen their equity base.5 At the same 
time, they deleveraged and ran down their 
debt ratio. These measures strengthened firms’ 
financial resilience. In the case of SMEs, which 
generally had little or no access to the capital 
market, a desire to reduce their reliance on the 
banking sector is likely to have played a role. 
Second, in times of heightened uncertainty, 
non- financial corporations seem to exhibit a 
preference for liquid assets. Third, tax consider -
ations, such as the preferential treatment of 
business assets with respect to inheritance tax, 
may have been a factor in owners’ decisions to leave more profits in their businesses. It should 
also be noted that, in this regard, profits re -
tained at corporations that are partly foreign-  
owned should be regarded more as a case of 
foreign investors saving their percentage share 
of profits. Lastly, the lower interest rates have 
forced enterprises with pension obligations to -
wards active and former employees to increase 
their provisions in recent years.6 Extensive pro -
visions have also been set aside in the energy 
sector to cover future burdens associated with 
nuclear energy, which also had the effect of 
pushing up savings.
In summary, then, the current account balance 
is the result of numerous, largely private- sector 
decisions both in Germany and abroad and 
therefore cannot be directly managed in a 
meaningful sense through macroeconomic pol -
icy. However, not least in view of the high level 
of saving exhibited by non-  financial corpor -
ations, there is a need to consider whether, 
and through which adjustments, private invest -
ment activities can be meaningfully enhanced.
Goods flows and balance 
of trade
German foreign trade expanded only moder -
ately in 2016. In the case of exports, this was 
caused by the continued slowdown in the pace 
of global trade. With regard to imports, it was 
evident that exports, and machinery and equip -
ment, as the two demand components with 
the highest import content, rose somewhat 
less robustly than in the previous year. On aver -
age in 2016, growth in exports of goods in real 
terms stood at 2%, compared with 5¼% one 
year earlier. The slight decline in prices meant Greater private

that the nominal increase was no more than 
just over 1%. Domestic activity remained robust 
overall, despite muted business investment, 
causing imports of goods to rise by a far 
stronger 3¾% in terms of volume. Owing to 
the sharp fall in prices, particularly for energy, 
the cost of imported goods went up by no 
more than ½% compared with 2015. This 
caused the foreign trade surplus to widen by 
€8 billion to €252 billion.
As in the two preceding years, goods exports 
to EU countries developed more favourably in 
terms of value than those to countries outside 
the EU. In particular, exports to central and east 
European EU countries outside the euro area 
expanded very dynamically.7 By contrast, the 
value of exports of goods to the United King -
dom decreased significantly, following two 
years of very high growth rates. The sharp de -
preciation of the pound sterling is likely to have 
played a key role here. As regards the euro 
area, demand for German goods picked up 
notably in Spain, thanks to the strong upturn 
there, but also in Italy and Portugal.
In 2016, the value of exports to countries out -
side the EU fell back slightly. A significant in -
crease in goods exports to Asia, especially to 
China and Japan, contrasted with a strong re -
duction in deliveries of goods to the United 
States, though growth rates here had been 
high in previous years. Sales to the OPEC coun -
tries also dropped sharply, probably on account 
of the negative impact of the reduced scope 
for petro dollar recycling caused by the fall in 
oil prices.
Demand in the international markets was par -
ticularly strong for German intermediate and 
consumer goods. By contrast, proceeds from 
the sale of capital goods increased at a below- 
average rate, given the ongoing subdued level 
of global investment activity. This was also true

parts, albeit after two highly successful years of 
pronounced growth in export sales.
The regional development of imports of goods 
in 2016 was very similar to the dynamics dis -
played by exports of goods. Exporters from 
central and east European EU countries not be -
longing to the euro area posted substantial 
gains. In terms of value, Germany’s partner 
countries in the euro area also benefited dis -
proportionately from the vibrant domestic de -
mand. Of the large euro- area countries, Italy 
and Spain increased their goods exports to 
Germany considerably. The same was true of 
Austria, from which Germany imported around 
one- tenth of its total imports from the euro 
area. However, the value of imports from the 
United Kingdom fell sharply. With regard to im -
ports from non- EU countries, these produced a 
mixed picture in terms of their development. 
Imports of goods from Japan, Switzerland and 
China rose significantly, while the value of im -
ports from the United States fell short of its 
level in 2015, when it was admittedly more 
than one- fifth up on the figures for 2014. Rus -
sia and the OPEC countries once again sus -
tained a painful downturn in their proceeds 
from exports to Germany due to the lower 
energy  prices.
Foreign sellers of consumer goods and of 
motor vehicles benefited to a particular extent 
from the brisk consumption in Germany. After 
price adjustment, imports of consumer goods 
were up by 6%, while those of motor vehicles 
and motor vehicle parts even increased by 
more than one- tenth. That said, the demand 
for intermediate goods from abroad was also 
very strong. Conversely, the increase in imports 
of traditional capital goods in response to the 
muted investment activity in Germany was less 
pronounced. Lastly, the value of imported en -
ergy fell by an exceptional margin, not just be -
cause of the sharp decline in energy prices but 
also as a result of the subdued demand for im -
ports of this commodity.Breakdown of invisibles
In contrast to 2014 and 2015, Germany saw its 
cross- border services deficit widen in 2016. In 
the reporting period, services provided by non- 
residents cost €22½ billion more than the rev -
enue generated by residents from services ex -
ports. The corresponding deficit thus widened 
by €4 billion compared with 2015, with ex -
penditure on services imports rising much more 
strongly than the amount of revenue raised by 
exports of services. Euro- area countries and 
non- euro- area countries benefited to a similar 
extent from the increase in Germany’s expend -Regional trends

iture on services. Since the higher revenue em -
anated mainly from business within the euro 
area, the result in the services account mainly 
deteriorated with respect to non- euro- area 
countries.
The increased level of expenditure in the euro 
area is probably in large part attributable to 
Germans’ preference for travelling to destin -
ations in this region. Cross- border travel, a sub- 
item of the services account, recorded a deficit 
of €39½ billion in 2016, €3 billion more than in 
the previous year. Year- on- year travel expend -
iture was up by a substantial margin (+5%); 
meanwhile, mounting political uncertainty in a 
number of holiday destinations led to an in -
crease in visits to Italy and Spain, as well as to 
Croatia. Destinations in Turkey, Egypt and Tu -
nisia were much less popular. Holidaymakers 
also switched to long- haul journeys to the 
United States, reversing the decline in 2015 
that had been induced by the worsening ex -
change rate.
The other sub- items of the services account 
shifted only moderately compared with 2015. 
The traditionally very high level of turnover 
generated by German enterprises’ international 
freight and logistics business decreased slightly 
during the year under review, with revenue 
contracting a little more than expenditure. The deficit in the transport account rose somewhat 
as a result. No clear trend was discernible for 
knowledge- based services in 2016. The inter -
national division of labour is making speedy 
progress in this area, with gross flows increas -
ing enormously from year to year. Foreign de -
mand for IT services from German suppliers is 
greater than German enterprises’ expenditure 
on such services from abroad. That said, 2016 
differed from previous years in that expenditure 
rose at a faster pace than revenue, with the 
result that the recorded surplus was slightly 
smaller than in 2015. The surplus in the re -
search and development account fell signifi -
cantly owing to the much higher foreign de -
mand exhibited by German market players. On 
the other hand, the increase in revenue from 
the use of intellectual property bolstered the 
surplus in this sub- account. Professional and 
management consultancy services –  also in -
cluding commercial services, which have re -
corded a deficit for a long time – as well as 
commissions, technical services and other ser -
vices showed greatly reduced deficits.
Germany’s primary income from abroad last 
year exceeded its corresponding payments to 
the rest of the world by €52 billion. This nar -
rowed the investment income surplus by €5 bil -
lion on the year. The main source of income 
here was net receipts from investment, which Increase in

decreased by nearly €4 billion last year. Given 
the ongoing expansion of Germany’s net exter -
nal assets, the positive contribution of the ac -
cumulation effect is countered by stronger 
negative yield effects. On the one hand, the 
yield level effect served to offset the increase in 
investment income as global interest rates flat -
tened out well into 2016. In addition, the 
stronger decline in yields on assets relative to 
the profitability of liabilities (differential effect) 
continued to work to the detriment of Ger -
many in its capacity as a net creditor.8 The nar -
rower surplus in cross- border investment in -
come is chiefly down to lower income. By con -
trast, expenditure was only slightly less down, 
with non- residents’ holdings of domestic secur -
ities mainly generating lower income.
As in the previous year, the cross-  border sec -
ondary income balance closed in 2016 with a 
deficit of €40 billion. There were no substantial 
shifts within the individual items either. This 
meant that government transfers to inter -
national institutions – including contributions 
to the EU budget  – remained largely un -
changed. Transfers in the opposite direction, 
from the rest of the world to government, fell 
slightly. By contrast, private sector transfers to 
the rest of the world receded a little and in -
flows from outside Germany increased some -
what. This was largely down to insurance pre -
miums and the settlement of balances by Ger -
man reinsurers. In addition, initial estimates 
also point to a rise in personal transfers abroad; 
these mainly included remittances.
Financial transactions
In 2016, Germany’s current account surplus 
was mirrored by net capital exports in the 
amount of €231½ billion.9 Much of this amount 
was attributable to portfolio investment, which 
was again considerably influenced last year by 
the Eurosystem’s large-scale purchases of 
assets for monetary policy purposes. Given the 
bouts of intense political uncertainty and a 
backdrop of low yields, German investors con -tinued to considerably increase their holdings 
of foreign fixed- income securities, though not 
to the same extent as in previous years. Foreign 
investors, on the other hand, divested them -
selves of domestic securities, particularly Fed -
eral bonds, most of which were ultimately 
taken on by the Bundesbank on balance. Direct 
investment likewise generated net capital ex -
ports, where continued strong international in -Almost no

vestment by German enterprises was crucial. 
Conversely, Germany recorded net capital im -
ports in other investment. These were driven by 
inflows of funds at monetary financial institu -
tions, enterprises and households. The Bundes -
bank once again saw another strong increase 
in its TARGET2 claims on account of the Euro -
system’s asset purchases in the year under re -
view.
Portfolio investment
Portfolio investment generated net capital ex -
ports of €208 billion in 2016, following €197 
billion one year earlier. German investors’ de -
mand for foreign securities and sales of Ger -
man portfolio assets by non- residents contrib -
uted to this result in almost equal measure.
Last year saw domestic investors acquire a net 
€96½ billion worth of foreign securities (2015: 
€122 billion). Yet again, interest- bearing secur -
ities attracted the strongest demand. At €49 
billion, however, net purchases of long- term 
debt securities were down on previous years. 
This decline undoubtedly had something to do 
with the sometimes unnerving effect which 
political events such as the Brexit decision in 
the United Kingdom, the US presidential elec -
tion or the referendum on the constitution in 
Italy had on market participants, above all in 
the second half of the year. German investors 
offloaded bonds from the rest of the euro area 
on balance, and they extended their stocks of 
long- term debt securities issued outside the 
euro area. The APP is likely to have played a 
significant role in this reallocation of assets. 
Under the APP , the Eurosystem purchased 
bonds issued in the euro area worth a total of 
€899 billion in 2016, which sent their yields 
sharply lower while the yields of non- euro-  
denominated paper increased –  distinctly in 
some cases  – over the course of the year. 
Though the shift into bonds from countries 
outside the euro area saw demand lean more 
towards foreign currency bonds, net demand 
for bonds denominated in euro remained quite high (€26½ billion). A large part of these bonds 
were picked up by German investors from the 
United States, where issuance of corporate 
bonds denominated in euro has increased in 
recent years on account of the low euro inter -
est rates.
As in the previous year, German investors sold 
money market paper worth a net €6 billion, 
particularly offloading short- dated bonds that 
had been issued outside the euro area.
With equities performing well overall on inter -
national stock exchanges, domestic investors 
bought €17½ billion in foreign shares in 2016; 
however, this was less than one year earlier. 
Many of these equities were purchased outside 
the euro area, with US securities constituting a 
significant proportion as usual. German invest -
ors also stepped up their exposures in foreign 
mutual funds. Much like the previous year, they 
bought foreign fund shares for €36½ billion. A 
large number of the fund companies selling 
fund units in Germany are domiciled elsewhere 
in the euro area, which is why this region was 
the focus of domestic purchases of mutual 
fund shares.
In the opposite direction, foreign investors sold 
German securities worth €111½ billion in net 
terms in 2016, having already divested them -
selves of domestic securities last year (2015: 
€75 billion). Substantial sales and redemptions 
of German government bonds (€113 billion) 
were crucial in this regard. In the low- yield en -
vironment – ten- year Bunds even dipped into 
negative territory over the summer months – 
the APP will have been a major factor. As part 
of that programme, the Bundesbank also 
bought German debt securities issued by the 
public sector, the vast majority of which was 
purchased from foreign holders.
The Eurosystem’s decision to purchase public 
sector debt securities under the APP has radic -
ally transformed German portfolio investment 
in recent years. The years 2015 and 2016 saw

worth €193 billion. Between the introduction 
of the euro and the end of 2014, by contrast, 
non- resident investors purchased German pub -
lic sector bonds to the tune of €699½ billion 
net. Hence, the APP is impacting significantly 
on the investor structure of public debt secur -
ities. On balance, the purchase programme is 
driving Federal securities into the ownership of 
the Bundesbank while foreign investor stocks 
are shrinking.
Meanwhile, the stocks of long- term bonds is -
sued by German private issuers held in foreign 
portfolios rose by €17 billion in 2016. After a 
number of years in which credit institutions 
domiciled in Germany redeemed debt secur -
ities on balance, the year under review saw a 
renewed net issuance of bank debt securities, 
meaning that demand was also being met by a 
greater supply.
Foreign investors, meanwhile, reduced their 
stocks of German money market instruments in 
2016. Redemptions and sales of short- dated 
private sector debt (€10 billion) contrasted with 
purchases of public sector issues (€2½ billion).
Stocks of dividend- bearing German securities in 
foreign portfolios barely budged in the year 
under review (-€1 billion), after German equi -
ties put in an average performance by inter -
national standards in 2016. Outflows of €7 bil -
lion were recorded for mutual fund shares.
The cross- border transactions associated with 
financial derivatives, which are aggregated to 
form a single item in the balance of payments, 
yielded net capital exports of €33 billion in the 
year under review. Forward and futures con -
tracts accounted for three- quarters of this fig -
ure, while the rest was mainly attributable to 
options. Cross- border forward and futures con -
tracts relating to electricity and gas sent a net 
€3½ billion abroad. Credit institutions were the

Direct investment
In a global setting with moderate economic 
growth and with different regions of the world 
facing diverging factors of influence and 
macroeconomic prospects, international direct 
investment flows fell overall in 2016, though 
developments varied from one region to the 
next. Preliminary estimates by the United Na -
tions Conference on Trade and Development 
(UNCTAD) indicate that cross- border direct in -
vestment in 2016 was 13% down on a strong 
figure in the previous year which almost 
matched the pre- financial crisis level; this esti -
mate put direct investment at US$1.5 trillion.10 
The downturn was notably driven by weaker 
investment in emerging market economies, 
where funding inflows were 20% lower than in 
2015. This might be related to flatter economic 
growth and dips in commodity prices. Direct in -
vestors also invested less in industrial countries 
in 2016 than one year earlier (-9%). The United States and United Kingdom bucked the overall 
trend, however, by attracting stronger direct in -
vestment; large- scale mergers and acquisitions 
also played a significant role in this regard. 
Transition countries,11 meanwhile, attracted 
stronger foreign direct investment in 2016 
(+38%).
Germany’s direct investment in 2016 produced 
net capital exports to the tune of €22½ billion. 
Intensive foreign direct investment by domestic 
enterprises combined with substantial inflows 
of direct investment into Germany contributed 
to this result.
Direct investment abroad by German enter -
prises was markedly weaker last year (at €69½ 
billion) than in 2015 (€101½ billion), but it was 
still at a high level compared with earlier fig -
ures. German enterprises primarily stepped up 
their foreign affiliates’ equity capital (€61½ bil -
lion).12 Profits generated and reinvested abroad 
(not distributed) also played a role. Domestic 
enterprises used the intra- group credit channel 
to provide funds to group companies abroad in 
the amount of €7½ billion. This was a weak 
rate of growth by longer- term standards. Ger -
man subsidiaries, in particular, used that chan -
nel to grant (almost exclusively short- term) 
loans to their foreign parent companies.
German enterprises use foreign direct invest -
ment –  which is a rather long- term instru -
ment – to pursue a range of strategic object -
ives. A survey by the German Chambers of

12 According to data from Thomson One (Thomson 
Reuters ), cross- border transactions by domestic enterprises 
associated with mergers and acquisitions increased by €14 
billion, which is the lowest increase there has been for 
many years. The number of transactions was also down on 
the year at 87. These are closed M&A deals in which the 
purchaser owns 10% or more of the shares in the target 
enterprise after the transaction. The establishment of new 
foreign affiliates and increases in the equity stakes held in 
existing foreign subsidiaries thus play an important role for 
Germany.Deutsche Bundesbank

firms from the manufacturing sector found that 
setting up sales and customer services was one 
of the most important reasons for investing 
abroad in 2016 (this was the case for 45% of 
the surveyed enterprises).13 Furthermore, in -
vesting in foreign production sites in order to 
access markets (response given by 31% of com -
panies) was again a key driver in 2016. In add -
ition, more enterprises than in previous years 
(24%) stated that they invest in production 
abroad on cost grounds. This reason has been 
steadily gaining in significance since 2013, fol -
lowing a decade of trend decline. According to 
the study, many enterprises saw red tape in the 
target country as the greatest risk to the profit -
ability of their direct investment. Respondents 
stated that political risks, currency risk and a 
lack of legal clarity as well in the target country 
could dampen future direct foreign investment.
Given this strategic motivation, German firms 
invest globally across multiple countries and in 
every region of the world. However, their direct 
investment relationships with other EU coun -
tries are particularly intense. First, these consti -
tute important sales markets for German prod -
ucts, and, second, the development and pro -
duction processes within Europe are often 
closely interlinked across borders. In 2016, 
around 60% of German outbound direct in -
vestment flowed to this group of countries. 
Looking at the individual target countries, the 
increase in German direct investment abroad 
was particularly strong in the Netherlands and 
Luxembourg – two key holding locations14 – as 
well in the United Kingdom, Spain and Poland. 
Countries outside Europe likewise attracted an 
increased volume of direct investment from 
German enterprises, with particularly high 
levels in the United States and China. Just over

ments were made by financial and insurance Regional profile:

service providers, roughly one- quarter were at -
tributable to enterprises in the manufacturing 
sector, primarily suppliers in the automotive in -
dustry, while just under a quarter were invested 
by companies that provide professional and 
technical services.
Non- resident investors stepped up their direct 
investment in Germany in 2016 by much the 
same amount as in 2015, providing German 
enterprises with funds amounting to €46½ bil -
lion, compared to €47½ billion in 2015. Specif -
ically, they provided German enterprises with 
€12 billion in additional equity capital, also by 
way of reinvesting profits. The main channel 
for inbound FDI, however, was intra- group 
lending, which came to €34½ billion. Loans ac -
counted for the lion’s share of this amount and 
largely took the form of reverse flows, by which 
a subsidiary domiciled abroad grants a loan to 
a direct investor in the home country. These 
flows often originate from capital market trans -
actions by financing vehicles, in which they 
issue securities abroad and pass on the pro -
ceeds to their parent companies in Germany. In 
contrast to previous practice, these reverse 
flows are now recorded as foreign direct invest -
ment in Germany pursuant to the rules of the 
Sixth Edition of the Balance of Payments Man -
ual.15 Flows were probably a great deal stronger 
in 2016 than in previous years on account of the favourable financing conditions for corpor -
ates in international capital markets.
The close cross- border links between corporate 
groups within Europe are also reflected in the 
regional profile of foreign direct investors, with 
more than three- quarters of inbound FDI in 
2016 originating from EU countries. Especially 
large amounts flowed to Germany from the 
Netherlands, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom 
and Malta. For the Benelux countries, reverse 
flows were an important channel for loans. 
Swiss and US investors also substantially ex -
panded their interest in Germany.16
Other investment
Other investment, comprising loans and trade 
credits (where these do not constitute direct in -
vestment) as well as bank deposits and other 
assets, saw net capital imports of €34 billion in 
2016.
Non- banks received foreign funds worth €10½ 
billion net last year. These inflows were driven 
exclusively by transactions at enterprises and 
households (€10 billion), largely on account of 
a decline in their balances at foreign banks. By 
contrast, inbound and outbound transactions 
by general government roughly balanced each 
other out over the year in net terms. Public in -
stitutions increased both their balances with 
foreign banks and their unsecuritised liabilities 
to foreign creditors. In addition, they slightly 
scaled back claims arising from loans abroad.
In the banking system as a whole, the net in -
flows of funds in 2016 amounted to €23½ bil -
lion. This was largely attributable to the net 
capital imports of monetary financial institu -Inbound FDI

tions (excluding the Bundesbank) in the amount 
of €68 billion – a development which saw for -
eign investors, above all banks domiciled out -
side the euro area, strongly increase their de -
posits at German credit institutions (€87 bil -
lion). This rise might have something to do 
with sales of bonds by foreign banks to the 
Eurosystem under the APP (see also the box on 
pages 30 and 31). At the same time, German 
monetary financial institutions withdrew de -
posits from banks abroad, but stepped up their 
lending to non- banks. The Bundesbank’s exter -
nal position rose by €45 billion in 2016 on ac -
count of transactions. This was primarily attrib -
utable to higher claims within the TARGET2 
large-  value payments system. At €170 billion, 
2016 saw the biggest increase within the space 
of a single year to date. This was mainly due to 
2016 being the first full year of operation for 
the APP and the increased monthly purchase 
volume of €80 billion being effective since last 
April. Clearly, a notable share of the purchases 
–  not only by the Bundesbank, but also by 
other Eurosystem national central banks and 
the ECB – is still being settled across borders by 
banks that participate in TARGET2 via the Bun -
desbank. This is ultimately behind the Bundes -
bank’s rising claims on the ECB.17 These higher 
external claims contrasted with a sharp upturn 
in the Bundesbank’s external liabilities of 
€125½ billion. With yields on short- term Fed -
eral bonds deep in negative territory, this was 
primarily driven by an increase in deposits, pre -
dominantly by central banks outside the Euro -
system. Cross- border transactions using euro 
banknotes, on the other hand, yielded out -
flows of €14½ billion.18
Reserve assets
Transaction- related changes in the reserve

fluenced by balance sheet adjustments which, 
in line with internationally agreed accounting 
standards, are not recognised in the balance of 
payments. The end- of- year revaluation of the 
reserve assets at market prices boosted their 
value by an additional €14½ billion in 2016.

The increase in Germany’s TARGET2 claims
The Bundesbank’s TARGET2 claims went up 
by €170 billion in 2016 to €754½ billion, hav-
ing already risen by €123½ billion in the pre-
vious year.1 These changes were directly re-
fl  ected in the German balance of payments as 
capital exports. This increase also continued into the new year. As at 28  February 2017, Germany’s TARGET2 claims amounted to 
€814½ billion and were thus signifi  cantly 
higher than the level reached during the peak 
of the European sovereign debt crisis in the 
summer of 2012 (see the chart below).2
The main reason for the strong growth in Ger-
many’s TARGET2 balances over the past two 
years was the implementation of the ex-
panded asset purchase programme (APP). This 
was due to the fact that a signifi  cant part of 
the asset purchases by the Eurosystem are 
conducted with credit institutions located 
outside the euro area. This is especially true of 
asset purchases from credit institutions oper-
ating in the City of London, as international institutions often hold a TARGET2 account with the Bundesbank either directly or indir-ectly via their subsidiaries domiciled in Ger-
many. If, for example, other Eurosystem cen-
tral banks purchase securities from investors 
domiciled outside the euro area and the seller receives a credit entry on a TARGET2 account 
held with the Bundesbank, this, in itself, 
would lead to an increase in Germany’s TAR-GET2 claims.
3 If this credit entry is made to an 
account that the seller holds with a bank domiciled in Germany, the deposits of non- 
resident investors held with German credit in-stitutions also increase in the other investment 
1 The sum total of TARGET2 claims/TARGET2 liabilities 
in the Eurosystem also rose during the reporting year 
by €245½ billion to €1,058½ billion.
2 At the same time, the Bundesbank’s liabilities arising from the allocation of euro banknotes within the Euro-system also rose. As at 28 February 2017, these liabil-ities totalled €330 billion.
3 In these cross- border transactions, any changes to 
the TARGET2 claims in the Eurosystem as a whole 
hinge on the existing TARGET2 positions of the NCBs 
involved in the transaction. This is explained in greater 
detail in: Deutsche Bundesbank, The impact of Euro-
system securities purchases on the TARGET2 balances, Monthly Report, March 2016, pp 53-56.

This was chiefly due to the higher price of gold, 
which drove up the value of German gold re -
serves. All in all, the year 2016 saw the carrying amount of Germany’s reserve assets climb by 
€16½ billion to stand at a value of €176 billion 
as at 31 December 2016.account. Conversely, the Bundesbank’s asset 
purchases conducted via accounts held abroad reduce Germany’s TARGET2 balance 
when viewed in isolation. This effect is, how-ever, lower than the one described above. The 
ECB plays a quantitatively important role in 
the increase of the TARGET2 balances, which 
itself purchases securities under the APP . The 
settlement of these purchases occurs via ac-counts held with the national central banks (NCBs).
4 In 2016, the ECB’s defi  cit in the 
TARGET2  system rose by €68 billion.
The impact of the APP on the TARGET2 bal-ances considered here focuses solely on the 
direct effects. The cross- border redistribution 
of the generated liquidity can result in further changes in the TARGET2 balances. It is worth 
noting, however, that these second- round ef-
fects do not cancel out the above- mentioned 
effects of the APP in a number of countries, 
including Germany.
TARGET2 balances could then be associated 
with a risk if a country with TARGET2 liabilities 
vis- à- vis the ECB leaves the monetary union, 
and if this claim has to be written off by the ECB. The Bundesbank’s TARGET2 claims 
would not be the relevant benchmark under 
these circumstances, however. Instead, the 
key factor here would be the TARGET2 liabil-
ities of the country leaving the monetary 
union. The losses which could potentially arise from a country not being able to fully fulfi  l its 
liabilities vis- à- vis the ECB would be shared 
among the remaining Eurosystem NCBs in line 
with their respective capital shares. Central banks with TARGET2 liabilities would there-
fore be affected in exactly the same way as 
those with TARGET2 claims on the ECB.
4 The ECB’s role in managing accounts in TARGET2 is 
essentially limited to other pan- European payment sys-
tems operated by the private sector (notably EURO1 
and CLS) where inpayments and outpayments mutu-
ally offset one another, therefore avoiding a build- up 
of TARGET2 balances at the ECB. The ECB can inter alia 
maintain accounts for other central banks as well as 
European and international organisations, but may not 
do so for credit institutions (ECB Governing Council’s 
decision ECB/ 2007/ 7).Deutsche Bundesbank

Federal states’ cyclical adjustment  
in the context of the debt brake
A debt brake was enshrined in Germany’s Basic Law ( Grundgesetz ) in 2009 in order to ensure 
sound government finances and compliance with European fiscal rules in Germany. The require -
ments are altogether ambitious and have helped bring about the positive budgetary develop -
ments of recent years. For the Federal Government, the rules have applied in full since last year. 
The federal states are still in a sort of transitional phase and will, in principle, be banned from 
financing their budgets through new borrowing from 2020 onwards. During periods of cyclical 
weakness, however, net borrowing will still be allowed, provided surpluses are generated when 
times are better. This is intended to ensure that the automatic stabilisers can continue to operate.
The procedures to take cyclical factors into account (known as cyclical adjustment methods) spe -
cified by the federal states as part of their debt rule vary, in some cases considerably. Some state 
governments – like the Federal Government – have based their cyclical adjustment methods on 
the procedure used by the European Commission. They identify the economic situation through -
out Germany and use this to estimate whether cyclical factors will cause tax revenue in these 
federal states in particular to exceed or fall short of expectations (macro- based methods). Other 
federal states regard deviations from a tax revenue trend or an average tax level as cyclical in 
nature (tax- smoothing methods). The various procedures are complex, and all have their own 
specific difficulties establishing cyclical factors. In some cases, they are also problematic in terms 
of continuous budget planning in the face of unexpected developments or the intended restric -
tion on the build- up of debt. However, these problems can be mitigated if suitable arrangements 
are put in place.
Overall, safety margins in relation to the budget ceilings are recommendable in order to be able 
to manage unexpected strains during downturns without having to resort to procyclical adjust -
ments. In addition, measures must be taken to ensure that the main objective of curbing debt is 
not undermined by extensive debt that is, officially, justified as being cyclically induced. One way 
to prevent this from happening is to use cyclical control accounts, where accumulated debt is 
recorded and automatic corrective action is triggered if it becomes too big. The adjustment 
methods and results should be documented in transparent and comprehensible fashion. In order 
to make it more difficult to find ways to expand debt in the short term, it would be useful for the 
rules to be enshrined in law with parliamentary prerogative.
The German debt brake is ultimately intended to ensure compliance with European fiscal rules. 
Different cyclical adjustment methods could mean that national rules are not always sufficient to 
ensure this throughout the country. It is up to the Stability Council to create transparency and, 
where necessary, initiate corrective action. In this context, it will also be important to monitor and 
limit potential discrepancies between the requirements under EU rules and national rules relating 
to other issues – eg on how to include off- budget entities and the use of reserves.Deutsche Bundesbank

Implementation of the debt 
brake at Federal and state 
government level
Germany enshrined a debt brake in its Basic 
Law (Article 109 (3)) in 2009 designed to end 
the rapid increase in the government debt ratio 
witnessed for several decades. Another aim is 
to ensure compliance with European fiscal 
rules, the provisions of which include a struc -
turally close- to- balance budget. First, net new 
borrowing by the Federal Government has, 
since 2016, been generally capped at 0.35% of 
gross domestic product (GDP) (currently around 
€10½ billion). Second, the federal states must, 
from 2020 onwards, generally balance their 
books without net new borrowing. The aim is 
to allow the budgets to adapt flexibly to cyc -
lical ups and downs. In other words, automatic 
deficits (resulting, for instance, from lower tax 
revenues) during economic downturns are per -
mitted1 if corresponding surpluses are gener -
ated when the economy is stronger. This sym -
metry is mandated to ensure that making al -
lowances for cyclical ups and downs does not 
result in a lasting increase in debt.
Cyclical fluctuations in the budget are not im -
mediately visible; they must be estimated using 
cyclical adjustment methods. For the Federal 
Government budget, the basic approach used 
is that employed by the European Commission 
in the context of the European Stability and 
Growth Pact and the Fiscal Compact. Currently, 
twelve federal states have put in place their 
own arrangements for a ban on new borrow -
ing to start in 2020 at the latest.2 However, 
only eight states have, to date, adopted con -
crete rules for cyclical adjustment. They differ 
considerably.3
Overview of the cyclical 
 adjustment methods chosen
The existing federal state methods determine 
cyclical effects primarily for tax revenue (see 
pages 51 to 56 for more detailed information on the individual approaches).4 They can be 
divided into two groups. In the first group, the 
cyclical component is, as in the procedures ap -
plied at Federal Government and EU level, de -
rived from an aggregate output gap. The out -
put gap represents the deviation of GDP in any 
given year from potential output. A positive 
value (overutilisation) denotes a good econ -
omy, while a negative value (underutilisation) Debt brake 
allows the budget to adapt flexibly to  cyclical ups and downs
Cyclical adjust -
ment methods 
have been  specified only in some federal 
statesSome methods 
are not directly  
linked to overall  economic 
 developments
1 This framework does not allow discretionary ad hoc 
measures to support the economy to be classified as cyclic -
ally induced and therefore to be exempted from the debt 
brake. Any debt that arises for this purpose is permitted 
only under the exemption clause for special crises. This 
would involve establishing a repayment schedule.
2 The general ban on new borrowing has so far been en -
shrined in the constitution in Bavaria, Bremen, Hamburg, 
Hesse, Mecklenburg-  West Pomerania, Rhineland- Palatinate, 
Saxony and Schleswig-  Holstein and written into State 
Budgetary Rules ( Landeshaushaltsordnung ) in Baden-  
Württemberg, Lower Saxony, Saxony-  Anhalt and Thuringia. 
Of these states, only Lower Saxony has, as yet, in place no 
cyclical adjustment at all. North Rhine-  Westphalia is cur -
rently debating whether or not to include the debt brake in 
the State Budgetary Rules. In the context of consolidation 
assistance for five highly indebted states under Art 143 (d) 
of the Basic Law, Berlin and the Saarland are also already 
subject to limits on their structural deficits until end-2019.

4 On the revenue side, income from taxes can, in general, 
be considered as being susceptible to cyclical changes, as 
can net transfers under the state government revenue-  
sharing scheme and the general supplementary federal 
grants to compensate for below- average financial capacity. 
For the most part, spending by the federal states is not 
taken into account, unlike in the case of central govern -
ment and social security funds, where unemployment-  
related expenses have an impact. Here, grants to local au -
thorities under the municipal revenue- sharing scheme may 
be relevant (in some cases, with a certain time lag): where 
the latter are tied to the state’s current tax revenue, this 
dampens the remaining cyclical impact on the state 
budget. In this case, it would appear sensible to put in 
place suitable deductions (as in the methods used in 
Baden-  Württemberg, Hesse and Schleswig- Holstein). Per -
sonnel expenditure, too, is subject to certain influences. 
Ultimately, collective wage agreements and civil servants’ 
pay adjustments depend on developments in negotiated 
wages in the private sector, which hinge on the state of the 
economy. Such effects, which imply an easing of pressure 
on state government budgets when the economy is in 
poor shape, are not, however, taken into account in the 
procedures employed to date. Focusing solely on cyclical 
effects in terms of taxes thus leads, all other things being 
equal, to a certain overestimation of the cyclical influences 
on the budget.Deutsche Bundesbank

suggests a poor economy and a value of zero 
(normal utilisation) neutral economic condi -
tions. Such procedures are called “macro-  
based” below. The second group, by contrast, 
directly adjusts tax revenue for fluctuations, 
without explicitly referring to overall economic 
developments. Deviations from the adjusted 
values are then classified as being cyclically in -
duced. Such methods will be referred to as 
“tax- smoothing”.
To date, Hesse and Schleswig- Holstein have 
opted for a macro- based procedure. Like the 
Federal Government, they apply the EU proced -
ure for drawing up the budget, which usually 
takes place in the spring of the preceding year.5 
In a first step, the cyclical impact on the budgets 
of state government as a whole is determined 
from the aggregate output gap according to 
the Federal Government’s current estimate.6 In 
a second step, the result is broken down to in -
dividual state level based on the state’s share in 
the tax revenue of all states (quota key) in the 
previous year.7
At a later stage (when the budget is finally ap -
proved and the extent to which the require -
ments have been met at budget outturn are 
reviewed), the cyclically adjusted tax revenue 
calculated when the draft was drawn up is 
merely adjusted for the financial impact of any 
changes to tax law that have occurred in the 
meantime.8 All other unexpected changes to 
tax revenue are attributed to cyclical factors. 
This means that the cyclical component com -
prises not only cyclical factors but also other 
deviations in tax revenue from the forecast in 
the draft budget (because, for instance, profit- 
related taxes differ noticeably from expect -
ations). On the one hand, this avoids the need 
for short- term adjustments when budget plan -
ning is at an advanced stage or the budget is 
being implemented should tax revenue differ 
from assumptions. On the other hand, it also 
means that new assessments about underlying 
development trends are initially temporarily 
classified as being cyclical in nature. However, 
any adjustments must then be made when the budget for the next year is drawn up and the 
estimate of cyclically adjusted tax revenue is re -
vised.9
On the other hand, the federal states of Baden-  
Württemberg, Hamburg, Mecklenburg-  West 
Pomerania, Rhineland- Palatinate, Saxony and 
Thuringia have opted for tax- smoothing pro -
cedures.10 The individual procedures differ in 
their definition of the revenue categories in -
cluded as cyclical, particularly with regard to the 
municipal revenue- sharing scheme, as well as in 
how changes to tax legislation are dealt with. 
There are also differences in the precise calcula -
tion of the (smoothed) “normal level” of tax rev -
enue. Baden-  Württemberg and Rhineland-  
Palatinate defined a one- off starting value for 
this in the past, which is carried forward on an Hesse and 
Schleswig- Holstein follow macro- based method used by the Federal Government …

the budget balance for the business cycle: the EU method -
ology, Economic Papers 536.
6 To this end, the output gap is multiplied by what is 
known as budgetary semi- elasticity for state government 
as a whole. General government budgetary semi- elasticity 
is currently estimated to be 0.55, ie a change in the output 
gap by 1 percentage point changes the ratio of the general 
government budget balance to GDP by 0.55 percentage 
point (see Price et al (2014), New tax and expenditure elas -
ticity estimates for EU budget surveillance, OECD Econom -
ics Department Working Paper No 1174). The cyclical ad -
justment methods used by the Federal Government and for 
the federal states receiving consolidation assistance are 
based on semi- elasticities of 0.20 for the Federal Govern -
ment and 0.13 for state government as a whole. Local gov -
ernment accounts for 0.06 and social security funds for 
0.15 (Bundesbank estimates).

see also H Gebhardt, R Kambeck and F Matz (2012), Kon-
junktur- und Strukturkomponenten der Länderhaushalte, 
Wirtschaftsdienst  92 (4), pp 256-260.
8 By contrast, for the Federal Government, the cyclical 
component for the adoption of the budget plan by the 
Bundestag is recalculated on the basis of the most recent 
estimate of the output gap (usually based on the autumn 
forecast). At budget outturn, it is corrected for the arith -
metical effects caused by a divergence of the nominal GDP 
path from that envisaged for the plan. See, for example, 
Deutsche Bundesbank, Key central government budget 
data in connection with the debt brake, Monthly Report, 
February 2017, p 63.
9 This procedure is currently also applied in connection 
with the consolidation assistance for the federal states of 
Berlin, Bremen, Saarland, Saxony-  Anhalt and Schleswig-  
Holstein up to and including 2019. Details on the cyclical 
adjustment method can be found in the annexes to the 
relevant administrative agreements.
10 The remaining federal states either have not (yet) legally 
enshrined a cyclically adjusted ban on new borrowing or 
have not yet made more detailed provisions on cyclical ad -
justment.Deutsche Bundesbank

ongoing basis at a trend growth rate (“tax trend 
procedure”). This trend growth is calculated 
mainly from the average rates of change of the 
revenue included in the past. In Hamburg, the 
trend level is determined econometrically under 
the assumption of a constant growth rate. By 
contrast, in Mecklenburg-  West Pomerania, Sax -
ony and Thuringia, the normal level is deter -
mined using the average level of tax revenue in 
several previous years (“tax level procedure”). 
Aside from a premium for inflation in the pro -
cedure applied by Mecklenburg-  West Pomer -
ania, structural increases in the course of eco -
nomic growth are disregarded in this approach.
Selected aspects  
of the procedures
The specifically chosen cyclical adjustment pro -
cedures differ – substantially, in some cases – in 
their design and results. Amongst other things, 
this relates to how the procedures deal with 
unexpected revenue developments which are 
not derived from cyclical fluctuations in GDP , 
the impact of an expected change in the under -
lying revenue trend, and the preservation of 
the symmetry of cyclical burdens and relief. 
Moreover, the transparency and vulnerability to 
manipulation of the procedures, as well as their 
relationship to the European rules, all play a key 
role. Selected aspects are discussed below.
Identifying relevant cyclical 
factors
Macro- based procedures are based on pro -
jected economic growth for Germany as a 
whole. They therefore might not take into ac -
count any cyclical factors that are specific to a 
federal state. However, pronounced one-  off 
cyclical developments specific to certain federal 
states also seem to be atypical, if anything.11 
Moreover, in most cases they are likely to be of 
only limited relevance to budgetary develop -
ments in the individual federal states anyway, 
because the federal revenue-  sharing system largely absorbs one- off developments in per 
capita tax revenue that are specific to certain 
federal states – especially for the financially 
weak federal states claiming general supple -
mentary central government grants.12
At the same time, macro- based procedures can 
entail the problem that the evolution of macro -
economic reference variables (gross wages and 
salaries, private consumption, entrepreneurial 
and property income) which are of particular 
relevance to tax revenue over the economic 
cycle is not always in sync with GDP . For ex -
ample, an increase in GDP that is driven by ex -
ports and investment yields less tax revenue 
than an upturn based on increases in wages 
and private consumption. The chosen macro-  
based adjustment procedures do not take such 
compositional effects into account.13 Further to 
this, the correlations between individual tax 
revenues and macroeconomic developments 
sometimes prove to be unstable (tax elasticity 
– how revenue for a specific tax responds to a 
change in the macroeconomic reference vari -
able – fluctuates or shifts over time). This is par -
ticularly true of profit-  related taxes and is not Major differ-
ences between procedures

11 For the city states, however, there are evidently restric -
tions here (see B Schirwitz, C Seiler and K Wohlrabe (2009), 
Regionale Konjunkturzyklen in Deutschland – Teil III: Kon -
vergenz, ifo Schnelldienst  62, p 25 f). Differences in GDP 
growth between the federal states are likely to have struc -
tural rather than cyclical causes in most cases.
12 For an empirical study of the impact of cyclical fluctu -
ations on state government budgets, see Rheinisch-  West-
fälisches  Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung (2010), Ermitt -
lung der Konjunkturkomponenten für die Länderhaushalte 
zur Umsetzung der in der Föderalismuskommission II ver -
einbarten Verschuldungsbegrenzung , Research project 
commissioned by the Federal Ministry of Finance, pp 13 ff. 
In the macro- based procedures, a trend change in a federal 
state’s tax potential in relation to the national average is 
reflected via the altered share in federal tax revenue, shifted 
by one year.
13 The Bundesbank therefore uses a disaggregated ap -
proach to cyclical adjustment, which derives the cyclical 
components of individual budget categories from the trend 
deviations of the key macroeconomic reference variables;

analysing public finances: Germany’s fiscal track record be -

of cyclical GDP fluctuations, see, for example, the section

nances” in Deutsche Bundesbank, Fiscal policy, Monthly

Cyclical effects in macro- based procedures
The macro- based procedures of the federal 
states involve estimating the cyclical compon-
ent at the time the draft budget is drawn up 
(usually in spring of the respective previous 
budget year), which is known as the ex ante 
cyclical component.1 As the budgetary pro-
cess progresses (fi  nal adoption of the budget 
plan, budget outturn), all other tax revenue 
changes are factored into the cyclical com-
ponent in the form of a tax deviation com-
ponent, provided that they are not attribut-
able to interim legislative amendments. The 
tax deviation component ultimately represents 
the tax estimation error. The chart below 
shows notionally for the period 1999 to 2016 
which cyclical components would have been 
shown at budget outturn if all the federal 
states had used macro- based procedures.
On balance, negative values would have pre-
vailed among the ex ante cyclical components 
during this period.2 On account of this com-ponent, predominantly negative economic conditions would therefore have been ex-
1 To simplify matters, the underlying output gap for 
the ex ante cyclical component is not determined 
using Federal Government’s method of determining 
potential output, but with a Hodrick- Prescott (HP) fi  lter instead. The HP fi  lter separates the trend of a time ser-
ies from the cyclical component (see R Hodrick and 
C Prescott (1997), Postwar US business cycles: an em-
pirical investigation, Journal of Money, Credit and 
Banking 29, pp 1-16). The HP fi  lter is criticised for its 
endpoint problem as well as dubious trend estimations where structural breaks occur. However, the endpoint 
problem can at least be mitigated by taking forecasts 
into account. Here, for instance, the government’s 
real- time assumptions for medium- term growth were 
used.2 The HP fi  lter is fundamentally symmetrical in design. However, there can be a preponderance of negative or 
positive trend deviations in a “real- time observation” (of the values determined at the respective point in 
time) if the underlying data or projections are revised 
or reassessed (or if incomplete cycles are being stud-
ied). When the trend deviations of 1999 to 2016 are 
uniformly determined using current data and projec-
tions, the positive and negative cyclical factors more or less offset each other in the period shown here.
Composition of the cyclical component at budget outturn in the (simplified) macro-based procedure for all the federal states
 *
* The ex ante cyclical component for the budget year t is determined on the basis of central government’s annual forecast from the 
spring of the respective previous budget year (t – 1). Here, the macroeconomic production gap is derived with an HP filter (lambda = 
100), then multiplied by the semi-elasticity of the budget for all the federal states (0.13). Central government’s current GDP estimate (as at 25 January 2017) is used to calculate the “cyclical component from current perspective”. The tax deviation component is the differ-
ence between the actual tax revenues (for 2016, the Working Party on Tax Revenue Estimates’ tax forecast from November 2015 was 
used as the most up-to-date value) and the Working Party on Tax Revenue Estimates’ tax revenues estimate from the spring of the re-spective previous budget year. The financial effects of legislative changes adopted in the interim have been adjusted. The cyclical com-ponent at budget outturn consists of the ex ante cyclical component plus the tax deviation component.

factored into the macro- based procedures.14 
These classify all tax revenue developments 
that are not found to be cyclical on the basis of 
GDP developments and the selected elasticities 
as structural when the draft budget is being 
prepared. In the course of budget implementa -
tion, however, the specific procedures chosen 
classify all tax deviations from the draft budget 
that are not explained by changes in tax legis -
lation as cyclical (see page 37).
In contrast to this, the tax- smoothing proced -
ures interpret all deviations from the identified 
trend or from the average level of tax revenue 
as cyclical, without factoring in macroeconomic 
developments. The trend procedures, at least, 
can – if appropriately designed – (implicitly) fil -
ter out the impact of compositional effects and 
any other cyclical fluctuations with regard to 
profit- related taxes.15 However, they essentially 
deviate from the debt brake’s objective to iden -
tify the cyclical factors in the budget (automatic 
stabilisers of aggregate growth), since, in the absence of any further provision, all –  even 
non- cyclical – fluctuations are classified as cyc -
lical. As a result, a major tax refund owing to 
court rulings, for instance, or – if including the 
municipal revenue- sharing scheme  – final 
settlements for preceding years are treated as 
cyclical phenomena. This constitutes a very 
broad interpretation.
The idea behind taking into account the eco -
nomic cycle is to symmetrically exclude the im -
pact of cyclical factors on the budgets from the 
limit imposed by the fiscal rules. In a downturn, 
tax revenue is weaker, and cyclically induced def -
icits resulting from this – according to the ad -
justment procedure  – are permitted. During 
periods of cyclical overutilisation, surpluses have Tax- smoothing 
procedures also adjust for non- cyclical effectsThe budget’s cyclical factors 
and macroeco-
nomic stabilising 
effectpected for the coming budget year, and 
matching cyclically induced defi  cits would 
have been permitted in the draft budget. The 
potential cyclically induced debt (cumulative 
cyclically induced defi  cits and surpluses) from 
1999 to 2016 would therefore have totalled 
as much as roughly 13% of the actual tax rev-
enues of 2016, with a slightly declining ten-
dency since 2011.
In addition, the chart on page 37 illustrates 
the considerable importance of the deter-
mined tax deviation component.3 In general, 
this estimation error would in fact have been 
a much stronger factor than the ex ante cyc-
lical component, amounting to up to 10% of 
actual tax revenues in some years. Between 
the turn of the millennium and roughly the 
middle of the last decade, it was therefore 
regularly the case that considerable unex-pected tax shortfalls occurred once the 
budget was drawn up, whereas in the follow-
ing years –  with the exception of 2009  – 
growth in tax revenue was underestimated.4 On balance, positive surprises would have 
predominated during the period shown here, 
meaning that a certain counterweight to the 
ex ante cyclical components would have been 
recorded. During cyclical upturns (measured 
by a positive change in the cyclical factor from a current perspective), positive surprises in tax 
revenue would tend to occur, while more negative surprises would be seen during 
downturns.
3 The estimation errors may be due to an unexpected 
macroeconomic development. They may have other 
causes, however, such as incorrectly estimated effects 
of changes in tax legislation, changes in the transfer 
pattern of profi  t- related taxes etc.

15 The tax- smoothing procedures differ considerably, how -
ever, in terms of the sufficiently lengthy estimation periods 
that are particularly important for this (length of the time 
series from which the normal level is calculated and, if ap -
plicable, carried forward).Deutsche Bundesbank

Results of various cyclical adjustment approaches 
for the past years
The various cyclical adjustment procedures 
identify a number of cyclical defi  cits and 
surpluses. The chart on page  40 shows what (simulated) normal levels of tax rev-
enue and cyclical components would have 
been produced for the state governments 
as a whole in the period from 1999 to 2016 
if the cyclical adjustment approaches se-
lected as examples had been used. The cal-culations are undertaken based on the cash 
infl  ow from tax revenues for a tax trend method (following the rules applied by Rhineland- Palatinate), a tax level method 
(following the rules applied by Mecklenburg- 
West Pomerania) and a macro- based pro-cedure (which uses an HP fi  lter to simplify the procedure of calculating the cyclical 
component).1 All things considered, it is evi-
dent that, in some years, the differing ap-
proaches would have shown sharply diver-
ging cyclical components and correspond-
ingly diverging normal levels of tax revenue. 
Even in the case of the sign and turning 
points of the cyclical components, clear dif-ferences are apparent.
Overall, the macro- based procedure pro-
duces, in cumulative terms, a slight prepon-
derance of cyclically induced deficits, 
whereas surpluses would have been calcu-
lated using the other methods. Especially at 
the current end, the macro- based proced-
ure shows higher normal levels of tax rev-
enue and is, to that extent, less restrictive with regard to its implied underlying fi  scal 
stance than the tax- smoothing procedures. Despite that, cyclical surpluses would never-
theless have been calculated over the past 
few years even applying the macro- based procedure.
2 In the period under observa-
tion, the macro- based procedure shows the 
highest volatility of the determined normal 
levels. A marked preponderance of cyclical surpluses is produced –  as is to be ex-
pected – by the tax level method (cumula-
tive positive cyclical component of roughly 
65% of the tax revenues over the entire 
period). In most cases, the cyclical compon-
ents determined using the tax trend pro-cedure display the largest fl  uctuations in absolute terms. Conversely, the growth 
rates of the normal levels show the lowest 
volatility – and their adjustments are quite 
largely driven by changes in tax legislation.
In retrospect, it is possible to make only a 
very limited assessment of what fi  scal policy 
stance the individual procedures would 
have brought about in concrete terms over 
the economic cycle, as the rules generally represent only ceilings and, in particular, safety margins below the ceilings might 
also play a part in the fi  scal policy. Precisely in the case of the tax level methods, there is 
–  prior to the granting of borrowing op-
tions – evidently also provision for a poten-tially extensive use of reserves, which means 
that a procyclical policy could also result if 
discretionary use were to be made of the relevant reserve volume and withdrawals were to be geared less to the economic 
cycle.3 In the context of the simulation, it is 
1 In all cases, it is assumed that all federal states would 
have used the standardised procedure. Specifi  cally, the 
aggregate revenues of all the state governments (ex-
cluding local government taxes of the city states) is composed of state taxes, the share of the federal 
states in joint taxes, the regionalisation funds for pub-
lic transport, the compensation payments for motor 
vehicle tax and the motorway toll, as well as the gen-eral supplementary central government grants (pegged to a given federal state’s fi  nancial capacity).
2 However, these are signifi  cantly lower when using 
the output gap estimates of the Federal Government 
based on the production function approach of the EU. 
In arithmetical terms, this leads from 2011, for ex-ample, to a cyclical component that, in cumulative 
terms, is some €8 billion lower compared with the HP fi  lter (roughly 3% of tax revenues in 2016).3 That being said, in real time there is a risk of percep-tion bias with regard to the economic situation.Deutsche Bundesbank

apparent for the period from 1999 to 2016 
that both macro- based and tax- smoothing 
procedures would have acted countercycli-
cally insofar as the modifi  cations of the de-
termined cyclical components in year- on- 
year terms tended to be in line with the 
change in the economic situation as seen 
from the current perspective.4 This would 
have been most pronounced in the macro- based procedure, not least owing to the es-
timation error component (see the box on 
pages 37 and 38).
4 “Countercyclical” is regarded in this context as a fall 
in the utilisation rate (cyclical downturn) accompanied by a decline in the cyclical component.Normal levels and cyclical components in the budget outturnfor the state governments as a whole
*
* To determine tax revenue, the cash inflow of state government as a whole (excluding the local government taxes of the city states) 
from tax after general supplementary central government grants was taken into account (for more details, see footnote 1). For the calcu-
lation of the normal level in accordance with the requirements of Rhineland-Palatinate (starting value  set to actual tax revenue of 1999) 
and Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, see the comments on  pp 53-56. The revenue effects of changes in tax legislation were determined 
on the basis of the state governments’ tax type-specific shares in the revenue effects of changes in tax legislation at general government 
level. In the macro-based procedure, the normal level is given by the unadjusted tax revenue less a cyclical component. For the derivation 
of the cyclical component in the budget outturn in the macro-based procedure using the HP filter, see the methodology on p 37. The 
Federal Government’s current GDP estimate is used to calculate the cyclical component from the current  perspective (HP filter) (as at 25 
January 2017).

to be generated which are sufficient to equal 
stronger tax revenue – not least to contain debt. 
This allows for a more consistent fiscal policy, as 
any automatic cyclical fluctuations that are iden -
tified do not have to be offset using discretion -
ary measures (such as a spending cut). Public 
finances  can thus have a stabilising effect on the 
cyclical trend within the framework of the rules.
There is no clear- cut answer to the question of 
which adjustment procedure produces a 
stronger countercyclical effect on macroeco -
nomic developments. Besides the specific de -
sign of the individual procedures, this also 
hinges on the respective causes of tax fluctu -
ations, the structure of macroeconomic growth 
and, not least, on any unexpected develop -
ments. Simulating the retroactive application of 
various procedures for the period from 1999 to 
2016 reveals that macro- based as well as tax 
trend and tax level procedures examined by 
way of example would have tended to have 
countercyclical effects in this period. From the 
present perspective, the cyclically induced def -
icits which were identified (in real time) under 
the procedures would mostly have changed in 
the opposite direction to the economic situ -
ation (see the box on pages 39 and 40). This 
correlation was most pronounced in this period 
(not least in cyclical downturns) in the macro-  
based procedure, which was attributable, in 
particular, to the fact that unexpected tax de -
velopments are factored in when implementing 
the budget. Precisely to ensure the low- friction 
processing of major unexpected developments 
that are repeatedly observed, safety margins 
below the upper limits on new borrowing add -
itionally offer valuable scope for adjustments. 
However, the discretionary use of such scope, 
or of other options such as reserves, could also 
result in a procyclical discretionary policy in all 
procedures, if such use is not geared towards 
cyclical conditions.Safeguarding symmetry
A key objective of the debt brake is to prevent 
any further, sustained accumulation of debt. If 
this is to be achieved, any cyclical influences on 
the budget stemming from cyclical adjustment 
procedures need to balance out, ie be symmet -
rical, over time. In other words, the aim is to 
identify the absence of any (or not be able to 
identify the presence of any) significant pre -
ponderance of weak revenue attributable to 
cyclical factors in the long term. Otherwise, the 
door would be left open to the possibility of a 
systematic rise in debt due to cyclical burdens 
being overstated.
In the case of the macro- based procedures, 
asymmetrical cyclical components can arise if 
the output gap estimate used for the draft 
budget or the cyclically driven revisions of the 
tax revenue forecast for the budget plan and 
the budget outturn tend to be biased in the 
same direction.16 In this scenario, it would be 
necessary to take precautions to counteract 
any debt build- up. It is therefore to be wel -

16 Forecast errors for tax revenue hinge primarily on macro 
estimates. No systematic bias has been found in the official 
tax estimates from previous years; see, inter alia, T Büttner 
and B Kauder (2015), Political biases despite external expert 
participation? An empirical analysis of tax revenue forecasts 
in Germany, Public Choice Vol 164, Nos 3 and 4, pp 287-
307. By contrast, the symmetry of output gaps under the 
EU method cannot necessarily be guaranteed due to a lack 
of restrictions in the estimation model in some cases. Em -
pirical studies also show that real- time estimates of output 
gaps using the EU method tend to have a negative bias, 
ie  they largely imply cyclical strains on the budget 
(see G Kempkes (2014), Cyclical adjustment in fiscal rules: 
some evidence on real- time bias for EU-15 countries, 
Finanz Archiv/Public Finance Analysis 70, No  2, pp  278-
315). A Hodrick- Prescott (HP) filter is a straightforward way 
to estimate output gaps and provides symmetrical devi -
ations for each underlying time series. Real- time distortions 
essentially only arise here as a result of correspondingly dis -
torted revisions of data and projections, as well as in the 
case of distorted extrapolations designed to mitigate what 
is known as the end- point problem (see M Mohr (2001),

– unlike the Federal Government17 – document 
those cyclically induced deficits and surpluses 
determined at budget outturn in a cyclical 
settlement account. This enhances transpar -
ency with respect to preserving symmetry as 
prescribed under their state constitutions. 
However, these same constitutions contain no 
concrete instructions to impose a limit on cu -
mulated cyclical components or enforce an ob -
ligation to reduce excessive debt classified as 
cyclical.
In the case of tax trend procedures, an inad -
vertent build- up of debt may occur, in particu -
lar, if calculated normal levels are only slowly 
brought into line with a declining revenue 
trend. Trend growth is likely to broadly lose 
momentum in the face of imminent demo -
graphic change, which, if developments in tax 
revenue are carried forward using only tax rev -
enue figures from previous years, entails an 
overestimation risk.18 Conversely, a pick-  up in 
the growth trend gives rise to predominantly 
positive cyclical components (which constrain 
borrowing options). It would be possible to ad -
just more quickly to trend changes if the refer -
ence period for calculating the normal level 
also covered forecasts. The downside to this, 
however, is that the calculated normal level fol -
lowing forecast revisions would likely be sub -
ject to greater fluctuations, which, in turn, 
would result in a more volatile fiscal policy. 
Overall, in the case of tax trend procedures, it is 
crucial if debt is to be effectively curbed that 
adjusting to a flatter trend does not take an 
undue amount of time. In the case of proced -
ures that incorporate revenue developments 
dating back a long time and make no provi -
sions for broadly declining trend growth rates 
(such as in Baden-  Württemberg), ensuring this 
appears less of a certainty. As a general rule, 
care should be taken to ensure that the starting 
values in tax trend procedures are not set too 
high, so as to prevent the structural revenue 
level from being overestimated over a pro -
longed period (see also pages 43 to 45).Similar to macro- based procedures, it is thus 
also necessary in the case of tax trend proced -
ures to keep tabs on – and, if need be, take 
corrective measures against – persistent debt 
arising from negatively distorted cyclical com -
ponents. In Rhineland- Palatinate, symmetry risk 
is being addressed by imposing surcharges or 
discounts on the regular carryforward rates for 
the normal level of tax revenue, which is de -
pendent on both hitherto cumulated and re -
cently estimated cyclical components.19 There 
is no such safeguard in place in Baden-  
Württemberg or Hamburg.
In those already established procedures that 
are not based on trends but rather on averages 
of past revenue levels (Mecklenburg-  West Pom -
erania, Saxony and Thuringia), a supplementary 
formal safeguard against the systematic build-  
up of cyclically induced debt currently appears 
to be less of a pressing matter. Assuming sus -
tained economic growth and an appropriate 
approach to changes in tax legislation, pre -
dominantly positive cyclical components (and 
thus only rare borrowing opportunities) are ex -
pected under these procedures – and that is 
despite the weak population growth in these 
federal states compared with the rest of Ger -
many.
Steady fiscal policy with 
 reliable curbing of debt

limits is presented with a major challenge if,

The impact of declining revenue trends and determining 
starting values in tax trend methods
In the following, selected features of tax 
trend methods –  that is to say, methods which extrapolate the calculated normal level of tax revenue in the previous year using a trend growth rate – are illustrated using stylised model calculations. To this 
end, stable annual trend growth in tax rev-enue of 3% is initially assumed in a baseline scenario.
1 A symmetrical business cycle over 
a total of ten periods (fi  ve upturns and fi  ve downturns) with cyclical upturns and down-
turns of up to 5% of tax revenue is then 
modelled by way of an example around this 
“true normal level”, starting with a down-
turn period. It is assumed that tax revenue 
moves in line with overall economic devel-
opments.
The impact of a changing revenue trend
The chart below shows that tax trend 
methods exclude the “true” normal level of 
tax revenue from the modelled economy if, given constant trend growth, the period on which the calculation of the normal level is 
based is equal to the length of the eco-nomic cycle.
2 If, however, the calculation period does not cover a full economic cycle, 
the normal level is more volatile, especially 
if the calculation periods are shorter.3 The 
calculated cyclical defi  cits or surpluses and 
their changes may decouple from the “true” 
economic cycle and thus, the implied underlying fi  scal stance may also be more 
procyclical or countercyclical.
If the trend growth slows down or acceler-
ates over an extended period of time, this 
could lead to more persistent over or un-
derestimations of the normal level of tax 
revenue. If lower trend growth rates in tax 
revenue are refl  ected only slowly in an ad-
1 This (nominal) growth rate is broadly in line with the 
assumptions in the Federal Government’s sustainability report for the period from 2020 to 2030. In this report, an average annual real GDP growth rate of around 1% 
and a rate of price increase of just under 2% is as-
sumed in a baseline scenario. See Federal Ministry of 
Finance (2015), Vierter Bericht zur Tragfähigkeit der 
öffentlichen Finanzen, pp 7ff.2 However, this applies only if the cyclical component 
– as assumed in the simulations – develops in a con-
stant relationship to tax revenue.3 As regards to whether the “true” normal level tends to be over or underestimated, this depends on the ini-
tially selected starting value in the cycle (see the next 
section for further details).

* Development in tax revenue according to the baseline scenario. In order to calculate the normal level in the “model t –  10”, the initial 
starting value is set at the level of tax revenue in period 1. For the following years, the previous year’s figure is extrapolated in each case 
using the geometric mean of growth in tax revenue over the past ten years.

justment of the calculated normal level, 
smaller rates of tax growth are interpreted 
as cyclical during the transition. Cyclical def-
icits derived in this way can lead to a 
marked increase in debt. The above chart illustrates how a gradual decline in the 
trend growth rate in revenue can lead to an 
increase in the cumulative negative cyclical 
components and thus in debt.4 The calcu-
lated normal level adapts more quickly if 
the calculation period also includes forecast 
fi  gures, and thus a foreseeably lower growth trend is taken into account at an 
earlier stage. This may, however, potentially result in the calculated normal levels being 
more volatile as forecast fi  gures, which are 
(potentially erroneous and) more prone to 
revision, are included in the calculation. Ex-
tensive cyclical components that are dis-
torted in one direction (brought about, for 
instance, by a trend deceleration in growth) 
4 A gradually declining trend growth from 3.0% ini-
tially to 2.5% is assumed over the period shown here. 
This decline is broadly in line with the assumptions in 
the Federal Government’s sustainability report, in which lower average real GDP growth of approxi-mately 0.5  percentage point is expected between 
2030 and 2060 on account of demographic changes.Tax trend method given declining trend growth in tax revenue*
* Compared with the baseline scenario, the trend growth rate in tax revenue of 3.0% initially (period 1) successively declines to 2.5% 
(period 21). See previous chart for details on how the normal level is determined in the “model t –  10”. In the “model t –  5 to t + 4”, 
forecast figures (t + 4) are included alongside values from the past (t –  5) when determining the normal level, with the assumption that 
these will indeed occur. When calculating the normal level in the “model t –  10 with correction”, a correction mechanism was modelled 
to ensure the symmetry of the cyclical components in line with the regulations in place in Rhineland-Palatinate.

fluctuations in tax revenue when drawing up 
the next draft budget are likely often only due 
in part to cyclical factors. For example, a down -
ward revision of expected GDP growth would 
probably be interpreted as structural in some in -
stances, while other factors – not ascribed to 
cyclical trends in the procedures – can also lead 
to unexpected tax developments. It would then 
be necessary for fiscal policy to take counter -
measures at relatively short notice and, where 
appropriate, of a procyclical nature.20 In those 
already established macro- based procedures, 
deviations from the tax revenue estimates in -
cluded in the draft (which are not attributable 
to changes in legislation) during further budget 
discussions and in the course of implementing 
the budget are indeed classified as cyclical and 
therefore do not create a need for adjustments 
at short notice. However, this will no longer be 
the case when the next budget is drawn up. It 
has become apparent, for example, that rela -
tively substantial negative tax estimation errors 
between 2001 and 2004 were not “excused” by unfavourable economic conditions in subse -
quent years (for more information, see pages 37 
and 38). With that in mind, given the lack of 
safety margins, considerable consolidation 
measures compared with the medium- term fi -
nancial plans in place at the time would have 
been required in the first half of the last decade 
in the event of an economic downturn.21
In the case of macro- based procedures, it 
would therefore seem prudent to factor in a 
relatively substantial safety margin below the 
new borrowing limit in order to avoid correc -… making 
safety margins prudentcan be prevented from building by means 
of a correction mechanism, which results in 
deductions from the normal levels if debt 
accumulates. This, however, is currently only stipulated in the federal state of 
Rhineland- Palatinate.
Distortions in determining the starting 
value
If a tax trend method is based on a starting 
value, this can lead to distortions when es-
timating the normal level. In order to illus-
trate this point, the starting value in the 
chart at the bottom of page 44 was placed 
in an –  unrecognised  – period of cyclical 
overutilisation (before the period shown).5 
It can be seen that, over time, cyclical debt 
is allowed to increase steadily. The starting 
value problem can be mitigated in terms of cumulating major cyclical components if an appropriate correction mechanism is put in place (currently only the case in the federal state of Rhineland- Palatinate).
5 A starting value in normal utilisation can also tend to 
lead to the normal level being overestimated if the 
economy is experiencing a period of upswing when 
the starting value is fi  xed and the period on which the calculation of the extrapolation rate is based does not cover the entire economic cycle.
20 Since the autonomy of individual federal states is very 
limited with respect to tax legislation, this would have to 
be primarily expenditure- based. See Deutsche Bundesbank, 
The introduction of state- level tax surcharges and dis -
counts, Monthly Report, September 2014, pp 44-46. Con -
sequently, actual adjustment options available at short no -
tice appear to remain relatively limited overall.
21 There was also an unexpected series of considerable 
revenue shortfalls in 2009, but this was promptly followed 
by an economic upswing. It would probably have been 
possible to make use of the exemption clause enshrined in 
the debt brake rules for the countercyclical measures that 
were adopted.Deutsche Bundesbank

tions needing to be made abruptly in the event 
of unexpected adverse developments.22 Such 
safety margins also make it possible, even if 
cyclical effects are underestimated, for govern -
ment budgets to absorb fluctuations in profit-  
related taxes.23 In addition, safety margins 
would provide a counterweight if real- time es -
timates of the output gap were to remain dis -
torted, as they have in the past.
Compared with macro- based procedures, tax-  
smoothing procedures –  which determine a 
revenue trend using a longer reference period 
from the past and taking into account generally 
expected trend growth (tax trend procedures: 
Rhineland- Palatinate, Baden-  Württemberg, 
Hamburg) – generally ensure smoother devel -
opments in eligible structural revenue. To this 
extent, the safety margins needed in the 
budget plans in order to stabilise fiscal policy 
may be smaller. However, a trend adjustment 
mechanism is required to ensure symmetry in 
these procedures, which could have a tendency 
to counteract this.
In the case of tax- smoothing procedures, which 
are based on the average revenue levels of pre -
vious years (tax level procedures: Mecklenburg- 
West Pomerania, Saxony, Thuringia), predomin -
antly positive cyclical factors are, as seen from 
the present perspective, likely to be identified 
in future. While these procedures ultimately 
permit a cyclical rise in debt only in exceptional 
cases, they do generally provide scope for ex -
penditure as long as it does not result in cyclic -
ally induced new borrowing. It is therefore to 
be assumed that, in the medium term, tax rev -
enue will broadly rise in parallel with nominal 
GDP , which also looks set to increase in fu -
ture,24 and thus be up on the average of previ -
ous years. Underestimations of structural rev -
enue developments are limited due to the rela -
tively short reference periods of three to five 
years for the normal level that applies here. 
However, in the upshot, the selected tax level 
procedures arguably only allow for borrowing 
in a highly unfavourable economic situation. 
Given rigid adherence to the determined nor -mal level, the budget would systematically 
“breathe” with a significant surplus.25 In prac -
tice, however, reserves that are formed from 
cyclical surpluses are probably intended to be 
used primarily to absorb revenue fluctuations. 
All in all, such reserves do indeed ensure greater 
flexibility when planning and managing the 
budget. That said, it means that cyclical factors 
no longer automatically affect the permissible 
fiscal balance. A procyclical fiscal policy stance 
would instead be triggered if the reserves held 
were not sufficient to offset cyclically induced 
fluctuations and net borrowing were not pos -
sible because the procedure failed to report 
any corresponding negative cyclical factors. 
This risk is especially pronounced if the reserves 
intended to absorb revenue shortfalls are insuf -
ficient, or if they have been used to cover other 
areas of spending.26
Relationship to EU rules
The individual federal states have chosen widely 
differing approaches to implementing the debt 
brake. This gives rise to particular challenges 
for budget consolidation and fiscal surveillance 
under both national and European fiscal rules. 
The European rules, for example, are directed 
at structural general government deficits, which 
are identified on the basis of the EU’s cyclical 
adjustment method. Seen in that light, the uni -
form application of this approach (as in the Tax trend pro-
cedures ensure “smoother” developments, but precautions necessary if excessive debt is to be avoided

cedures prevent unintentional

regel: Sicherheitsabstand für eine stetige Finanzpolitik, 
Wirtschaftsdienst  89(9), pp 630-636.
23 As a general rule, underestimation due to modelling 
errors is to be distinguished from underestimation due to 
forecast errors, although the two are somewhat related 
(see R Morris et al (2009), Explaining government revenue 
windfalls and shortfalls: an analysis for selected EU coun -
tries, ECB Working Paper No 1114, pp 23-24).
24 The increases are also not likely to be offset by any 
population decline.
25 Occasionally, borrowing restrictions even go as far as to 
only permit borrowing if the low normal level is undershot 
by a further 3%, such as in Mecklenburg-  West Pomerania 
or Saxony. Fiscal leeway is curbed even further when the 
fiscal policy stance is oriented towards this threshold.
26 For example, in the procedure applied by Mecklenburg- 
West Pomerania, only part of the reserves in the new spe -
cial fund are solely intended to cover cyclical revenue short -
falls. For details on the procedure, see p 55.Deutsche Bundesbank

Tax level procedures tend to report positive cyclical factors
The chart below presents the smoothing 
behaviour of tax level procedures in simple 
terms (procedures which calculate the nor-
mal level as the average tax revenue from 
previous years). It is evident that, in the case of a positive growth trend, the normal level of tax revenue determined using these pro-
cedures is almost consistently below the modelled “true” normal level (see the box 
on pages 43 to 45 for more details on the 
development of simulated tax revenue). 
Thus, the determined cyclical factors do not offset each other on average; instead, pre-dominantly positive cyclical components are 
reported. The more data points from the 
past are taken into account when determin-ing the normal value, the greater the extent 
to which the “true” normal level (in the 
case of a positive growth trend) tends to be 
undershot. Shorter reference periods for 
the calculation can, on the other hand, lead 
to more volatile normal levels being deter-
mined when there are pronounced cyclical 
fl  uctuations. The underestimation of the normal level is mitigated if, as in the pro-
cedure applied by Mecklenburg- West Pom-
erania, infl  ation effects are taken into con-sideration, leaving real trend growth as the only remaining reason for underestimation.
As long as matching surpluses are not aimed for in the case of tax level proced-ures, reserves are needed to safeguard a steady fi  scal policy in the event of weaker growth in tax revenue. If the reserves are not suffi   cient, a cyclical breathing of the 
budgets is no longer possible.
Smoothing behaviour of tax level procedures*
* Development in tax revenue according to the baseline scenario (see p 43). The normal level of tax revenue in “model t – 5” and 
”model t – 10” is the average revenue for previous periods (from t – 1 to t – 5 and t – 1 to t – 10). In order to calculate  the normal value in 
“model t – 5 adjusted for inflation”, the revenue level for each of the previous five years was increased by an inflation component of 2% prior to calculating the mean value.

case of the Federal Government) would have 
the advantage of making it easier to identify 
looming conflicts with the European rules in all 
federal states. The state government- specific 
requirements may be much less strict than the 
EU rules, especially if large shortfalls in revenue 
unconnected with cyclical fluctuations in GDP 
are judged to be cyclical.27
Transparency and resiliency
Both the macro- based and tax- smoothing 
methods are complex in detail. However, they 
run the risk of being treated flexibly to the det -
riment of curbing debt if the estimations de -
pend to a considerable extent on components 
that have been selected on a discretionary basis 
and are therefore easy to modify. This can im -
pair the transparency, comprehensibility and 
stability of the adjustment methods and of the 
relevant estimations.28 All things considered, 
with methods lacking control mechanisms 
there is an inherent danger of regular recourse 
to discretionary leeway in order to classify def -
icits as cyclically induced, thus creating short-  
term scope for obtaining finance. The latter 
applies less to the macro- based methods in 
Hesse and Schleswig- Holstein, the results of 
which essentially depend on estimations by 
Federal Government using the EU method.
Robust estimation procedures that deliver con -
sistent results without ad hoc  adjustments, say, 
to the method or to the parameters, are there -
fore beneficial. Furthermore, correction mechan -
isms – in particular, for safeguarding symmetry – 
should be framed in a rule- bound manner. A 
strong legal anchoring through a parliamentary 
prerogative is also desirable so that deliberate 
modifications of the procedure for the purpose 
of creating fiscal space are, at least, made more 
transparent and thus more difficult.29
In all the methods, care should be taken that 
there is a clear definition of the aggregate rev -
enue that is relevant to the cyclical adjustment 
and, in the case of tax- smoothing procedures, that the treatment of the financial  impact of 
changes in tax law is disclosed.30 In the case of 
methods which classify deviations from the tax 
estimate as cyclical in the context of adopting 
and implementing the budget, this is to be 
based on the official regionalised tax estimate 
– as is current practice in the monitoring of fed -
eral states in receipt of consolidation assis -
tance.31 Otherwise, there would be a risk of ex -
cessively favourable budget estimates produ -
cing systematically negative estimation com -
ponents, thus potentially opening the door to 
the accumulation of cyclically induced deficits.

Monthly Report, January 2011, pp 55-60. The EU’s produc -
tion function approach has often been modified in the past 
(most recently in autumn 2016) and, particularly at the cur -
rent end, displays some results that are not very plausible in 
terms of the derived economic situation. In this connec -
tion, see the debate on the treatment of refugees in the

29 In this connection, enshrining the procedure in the fed -
eral state constitution or in the federal State Budgetary 
Rules, as in Baden-  Württemberg, Saxony and Thuringia, 
would be preferable to a legal regulation or an internal ad -
ministrative rule. For a fundamental change in procedure 
– such as in Schleswig- Holstein recently – parliament has to 
be involved. The technical details concerning the practical 
implementation of the cyclical adjustment should also be 
subject to the consent of the federal state parliaments.

arated from cyclical factors and have a direct impact on the 
fiscal scope.

respective estimations should be made public 
along with the budget documentation.32
Conclusions
In terms of the debt brake’s objective, the out -
lined methods have various strengths and 
weaknesses. One fundamental problem of 
budgetary planning consists in the fact that, in 
the event of adverse developments, there may 
be mutually conflicting goals with regard to a 
steady fiscal policy, an automatic stabilisation 
of economic activity, and a sustained curbing 
of debt. Given the variety of methods, this may 
be marked to differing degrees and also de -
pends in each case on the concrete macroeco -
nomic and fiscal trends and the related forecast 
errors. Any potential problems can, however, 
be mitigated by suitable framing and budget -
ary planning in the case of both macro- based 
and tax- smoothing approaches.
Especially in the case of macro- based proced -
ures with a need for short- term adjustment to 
unexpected non- cyclical developments, safety 
margins with regard to the borrowing limits are 
advisable. As a matter of principle, allowance 
should be made for these in planning the 
budget – as a rule, they should also actually be 
complied with  – and, when the buffers are 
used, the subsequent path of consolidation in 
order to build them up again should be safe -
guarded in the medium- term planning. Add -
itionally, specific arrangements should be made 
that prevent an unintended persistent accumu -
lation of debt. Besides controlling for actual de -
viations from the structural budget ceiling (eg 
control account with Federal Government), 
monitoring the symmetry of cyclical compon -
ents (eg via cyclical compensation accounts in 
Hesse and Schleswig- Holstein) are relevant in 
this context. If the cyclical compensation ac -
counts exceed a given threshold value, a sys -
tematic medium-  term reduction rule, which 
can also take into account the given economic 
situation, could come into play. However, as 
long as safety margins between the borrowing limit and the cyclically adjusted actual outturn 
are maintained in the period under observa -
tion, netting with the accumulated credit bal -
ance on the control account seems to be the 
obvious thing to do.33 As long as the proced -
ures employed are not extremely biased and 
safety margins are reported regularly, the re -
duction rule is ultimately hardly likely to be trig -
gered.
The tax-  smoothing procedures do not follow 
directly from macroeconomic developments. 
Admittedly, in practice it is generally difficult to 
draw a distinction between cyclical and other 
fluctuations in revenue, and a direct smoothing 
of tax revenue can indeed represent a work -
able alternative. Nevertheless, the reference 
value that is to be smoothed should be ad -
justed at least for the (officially estimated) rev -
enue effect of tax law changes. Furthermore, 
the smoothing mechanisms do not by them -
selves ensure that the deviations of actual rev -
enue from their projected level offset each 
other sufficiently quickly over time, thus pre -
venting a systematic growth in debt. For that 
reason, the actual deviations should be re -
corded (as in Hamburg and Rhineland-  
Palatinate) and a persistent build- up of debt 
should be prevented by appropriate correction 
mechanisms (as in Rhineland- Palatinate). If the 
actual revenue were to substantially exceed the 
projected normal revenue over an extended 
period of time, this would suggest a correction 
in order to expand the available budgetary lee -
way.Stabilising fiscal

32 In this respect, Rhineland- Palatinate does indeed set an 
example in terms of a clear and transparent presentation of 
the relevant information; see Finanzplan des Landes 
Rheinland- Pfalz for 2016 to 2021. Owing to its complexity, 
the results of the European Commission’s method of esti -
mating potential are not immediately self- evident – even 
though it is comparatively well documented in papers (op 
cit) and online ( https://circabc.europa.eu ). For the Federal 
Government’s estimation, which is fundamentally based on 
the same procedure, it would be desirable to have a trans -
parent and comprehensible account of differences (both in 
methodology and in terms of data input) between the EU’s 
and the government’s estimates.
33 If cyclical burdens are overestimated, the resulting 
structural balance would be all the more favourable. To this 
extent, netting with the control account appears to be in 
conformity with the system.Deutsche Bundesbank

Because the normal level is determined very 
conservatively, the level- based procedures offer 
protection against a persistent build- up of debt 
classified as cyclical. Typically, current tax rev -
enues significantly exceed this normal level. If 
matching surpluses are not consistently aimed 
for, reserves have to be formed to be able to 
offset any tax fluctuations. If these reserves are 
not sufficient, a cyclical “breathing” of the 
budgets over the cycle is scarcely possible any -
more, since new borrowing will now, in reality, 
be possible only in exceptional cases. Given 
these rules, it is therefore especially important 
either to be able to “breathe” in the position of 
a surplus or to protect the extensive reserves 
needed for a lengthy slowdown from being 
used in the political process for another pur -
pose – which experience has shown to be diffi -
cult.
The decline in trend GDP growth observed in 
retrospect over a fairly long period has ultim -
ately also put a brake on growth in tax rev -
enue. The expected reduction in the working 
population suggests anticipating limited and, if 
anything, falling growth rates in the case of tax 
revenue. Methods that are based on past rates 
of growth (Baden-  Württemberg, Hamburg, 
Rhineland- Palatinate) might therefore tend to 
overestimate the normal level. Generally speak -
ing, this bias could be mitigated by including 
the projected growth in revenue for the com -
ing years, which takes account inter alia  of 
demographic developments. At the same time, 
however, this would heighten the normal lev -
el’s susceptibility to revision, as inaccurate fore -
casts cannot be ruled out. By contrast, taking 
average revenue levels in the past as a starting 
point (Mecklenburg-  West Pomerania, Saxony, 
Thuringia), even with low GDP growth, would 
probably still tend to lead to the normal level of 
tax revenues being underestimated.
In order for the procedures –  irrespective of 
their specific design – to deliver results that are 
consistent over the long term and offer as little 
scope as possible for modification, they should 
be robust and firmly anchored in law. This means, in particular, that the methods or par -
ameters should not be adjusted (as this option 
could be misused, say, for creating short- term 
budgetary leeway). Insofar as adjustments are 
part of ensuring symmetry, they should be 
made in a rule- bound manner, as in Rhineland- 
Palatinate, for example. Reasons would have to 
be given for more fundamental methodological 
adjustments – preferably in a parliamentary 
procedure. What is also important is that 
methods, data resources and results are trans -
parent and fundamentally understandable to 
the general public.
Harmonised reporting seems advisable, not 
least in order to make it easier to keep track of 
the numerous specific procedures. This should 
encompass a statement of the cyclical net bur -
dens that have accumulated so far as well as 
the accumulated balances of the control ac -
counts for deviations from the borrowing limit 
when the budget is being implemented. Re -
porting could take place in connection with the 
Stability Council’s monitoring of Federal and 
state government compliance with the debt 
brake rules.34 The results could be compared 
with those that would have been produced 
given a uniform cyclical adjustment using the 
EU method. Additionally, the results could be 
verified using a method based on the HP filter, 
since this has advantages for fiscal surveillance 
in terms of comprehensibility and reproducibility 
compared with the less transparent EU method. 
A high degree of transparency and comprehen -
sibility can counteract potential political pres -
sure to use the cyclical adjustment method to 
expand the available fiscal leeway to the detri -
ment of the intended capping of debt.
The national debt brake should, not least, safe -
guard compliance with the rules of the Euro -
pean Stability and Growth Pact and of the Fis -
cal Compact. A cyclical adjustment method

implemented only in two federal states so far. It 
therefore cannot be ruled out that, say, an 
overall more favourable assessment of the cyc -
lical factor (lower cyclical burden or higher cyc -
lical relief) in some years would mean that the 
European rules set stricter requirements than 
the aggregated debt brakes of the individual 
central, state and local governments. In this re -
spect, the onus is on the Stability Council to 
identify any discrepancies as soon as possible 
and to coordinate any adjustments of fiscal 
policy between Federal Government and state 
governments. Irrespective of differences result -
ing from the methods of cyclical adjustment, 
however, it seems important in this connection 
to make transparent and, if necessary, limit any 
other discrepancies between the EU require -
ments and the national rules. Account should be taken of existing methodological discrepan -
cies, say, in the treatment of premium and dis -
count amounts in interest expenditure, debt 
relief or potential extensive recourse to reserves 
and provisions. Moreover, given that the debt 
brake is designed to enshrine the EU rules con -
stitutionally in the Basic Law, it would seem 
prudent to apply the debt brake not only to the 
federal states’ core budgets but also to include 
the off- budget entities that count as part of the 
government sector. Lastly, it should be taken 
into consideration that large deficits of social 
security funds and local governments are also a 
factor in the context of the EU rules. The Stabil -
ity Council would have to ensure that this 
leads, where necessary, to stricter requirements 
for the Federal Government and the federal 
state governments.
Annex
Overview of current cyclical 
adjustment methods at state 
government level
Those federal states that have already adopted cyc -
lical adjustment rules have, in some cases, opted for 
quite different methods. The following tables sum -
marise the key features of these various approaches. 
For the most part, the information stems from laws 
(usually the State Budgetary Rules (Landeshaushalts -
ordnung)  and/or Regulations (Verordnungen)).  How -
ever, as these could not provide all the details re -
quired, supplementary information from the relevant 
state ministries has also been taken into consider -
ation. The tables cover the following aspects.
Method to calculate the cyclical 
 component
In macro- based methods, the cyclical component for 
the draft budget is first determined for state govern -
ment as a whole based on the current estimate for 
the output gap. The share for each state is then cal -
culated using a “quota key”. Updates to the budget -
ary components in question when the budget dis -
cussions are concluded (budget plan), supplemen -
tary budgets adopted and the outturn determined 
are generally deemed to be cyclically induced.In tax- smoothing methods, the cyclical component 
is measured as the deviation of a tax revenue aggre -
gate, which is defined as being cyclically sensitive, 
from its “normal level”. The normal level is derived 
either by explicit reference to trend growth in tax 
revenue (tax trend method) or by benchmarking 
average tax revenue over several prior years (tax level 
method).
Cyclically sensitive tax revenue aggregate
A common requirement of the methods outlined 
above is to define which budget categories are to be 
included as cyclically sensitive factors. In most cases, 
these are defined as tax revenue after transfers to/
receipts from the state government tax revenue-  
sharing scheme, and general supplementary grants 
from central government, which vary depending on 
a federal state’s financial capacity. Divergent defin -
itions are listed in the overview.
Adjustment for the financial impact 
of changes in tax legislation
Under macro- based methods, there is no need to 
separately gauge the financial impact of legislative 
changes at the draft budget stage as the cyclical 
component is derived directly from the output gap Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
March 2017  
51

and the impact of legislative changes is thus auto -
matically classified as being structural. However, if 
changes in tax legislation occur during the course of 
further budget discussions and implementation, it 
must be ensured that these changes are correspond -
ingly assigned to the structural component.
Under most tax-  smoothing methods the estimated 
financial impact is filtered out of the tax aggregate 
prior to smoothing (so as not to classify it as cyclical) 
and then refactored into the smoothed tax revenue 
level.Control mechanisms to ensure symmetry
Germany’s Basic Law (Grundgesetz)  permits the 
symmetrical factoring- out of cyclical effects so as to 
prevent a sustained rise in debt from being falsely 
attributed to cyclical factors. However, as it is ex -
tremely difficult for estimation methods to do this in 
practice, the cumulated cyclical components are par -
tially recorded in a separate cyclical control account. 
One state (Rhineland- Palatinate) also uses a formal -
ised correction process to limit inaccurate valuations.Deutsche Bundesbank

Macro- based methods
 
State/Legal basis Description of method
Hesse
Sections 5 and 6 of the Act implement-ing Article 141 of the Constitution of Hesse (H Act)Method to calculate the cyclical componentFor the draft budget (ex ante cyclical component):The method for calculating the ex ante cyclical component is fundamentally based on the Federal Government’s cyclical adjustment method. In a ﬁ  rst step, the cyclical component is calculated for state government as a whole. This is done by multiplying the aggregate output gap (the Federal Government’s most recent estimate) by the budget semi- elasticity for state government as a whole (0.13). Hesse’s share in the cyclical component for state 
government as a whole is determined in line with its prior- year share in overall state government tax revenue 
(section 5 (3) H Act).For the budget plan and budget outturn:The ex ante cyclical component for the draft budget is expanded to include a tax deviation component. The tax deviation component is computed as the difference between expected tax revenue when the budget discussions were concluded or actual tax revenue at the end of the budget year and the tax revenue estimate when the budget was drawn up (baseline tax revenue), taking account of the impact of changes in tax legislation made in the intervening period (section 5 (2) to (5) H Act).
The effects of the municipal revenue- sharing scheme are to be considered when calculating both baseline tax 
revenue and actual tax revenue (section 5 (4) H Act).
Control mechanisms to ensure symmetry
The cyclical component determined at budget outturn is recorded in a cyclical control account (section 6 H Act).
Results for 2015 and 2016
2015:  ex ante cyclical component: -€0.1 billion (-0.5% of baseline tax revenue), ex post cyclical component: +€0.4 
billion (+2.7% of actual tax revenue).

billion (+7.0% of actual tax revenue).
Schleswig- HolsteinAct implementing Article 61 of the Constitution of Schleswig- Holstein (SH Act)Method to calculate the cyclical componentFor the draft budget (ex ante cyclical component):The method for calculating the ex ante cyclical component is fundamentally based on the Federal Government’s cyclical adjustment method. In a ﬁ  rst step, the cyclical component is calculated for state government as a whole. This is done by multiplying the aggregate output gap (the Federal Government’s spring estimate) by the budget 
semi- elasticity for state government as a whole (0.13). Schleswig- Holstein’s share in the cyclical component for 
state government as a whole is determined in line with its prior- year share in overall state government tax revenue (section 6 SH Act).For the budget plan and budget outturn:The ex ante cyclical component for the draft budget is expanded to include a tax deviation component. The tax deviation component is computed as the difference between expected tax revenue when the budget discussions were concluded or actual tax revenue at the end of the budget year and the tax revenue estimate when the budget was drawn up (baseline tax revenue), taking account of the impact of changes in tax legislation made in the intervening period (section 6 SH Act).
The effects of the municipal revenue- sharing scheme are to be considered when calculating both baseline tax 
revenue and actual tax revenue (section 6 (2) SH Act).
Control mechanisms to ensure symmetry
The cyclical component determined at budget outturn is recorded in a cyclical control account (section 6a SH Act). Receipts from the federal ﬁ  nancial equalisation system are accounted for on an accruals basis.

The cyclical component is deﬁ  ned as the product of the aggregate output gap estimated by the Federal 
Government on the basis of the EU methodology and of the budget semi- elasticity (0.205). It is usually calculated twice for one budget: as a rule, the output gap estimate from spring is used for the draft budget and the estimate from the autumn preceding the budget year for the budget plan (section 5 (2) Article 115 Act; section 2 Article 115 Regulation).For the budget outturn:The cyclical component is updated by adjusting the output gap determined at the time when the budget is 
adopted for the GDP effects arising from the difference between the year- on- year rate of change in (nominal) GDP 
determined at budget outturn (ﬁ  nalised on 1 September of the following year) and the change in (nominal) GDP expected at the time of budget adoption (section 3 Article 115 Regulation).

For the years thereafter, the amount is extrapolated using geometric mean growth in net tax revenue for the 30 years prior to the budget year.

Hamburg
Sections 27 (1) and (2) and 79 (3) SBR; Article 40 section 5 (7) of the Act to  strategically realign the budgetary frame-work of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg (Ham Act)Preliminary noteThe following information is partly based on the explanatory memorandum to the draft Ham Act (Drucksache 20/ 8400), pages 57-60. This states that the task of choosing an appropriate method falls within the remit of the Hamburg Senate. Hence the details cannot always be extracted from the legislative text as they may be changed for good reason.
Method to calculate the cyclical component
The normal level (referred to as the “multi- year trend in tax receipts” in the legal regulations) is estimated as an exponential trend using the mathematical method of least squares (Drucksache 20/ 8400, page 57). The calculation 
uses actual values covering the previous 21 years (section 27 (2) SBR). Under the double- entry bookkeeping 
approach tax receipts are used (instead of tax revenue).
Adjustment for the ﬁ  nancial impact of changes in tax legislation
Adjustment is made for the ﬁ  nancial impact of changes in tax legislation applied for the ﬁ  rst time after 
31 December 2014 (Article 40 section 5 (7) Ham Act) and that are adopted before 31 March of the year prior to 
the budget year (Drucksache 20/ 8400, page 58). The ﬁ  nancial impact of any changes in tax legislation adopted 
after this date are thus classiﬁ  ed as “cyclical” in the budget year in question. One exception to this rule is short- term 
changes in the distribution of turnover tax, which are also recognised after 31 March and trigger corresponding adjustments to the trend value of the budget year in question (Bürgerschafts- Drucksache 21/ 2176).
Control mechanisms to ensure symmetry, non- standard features
If the “cyclical position” (see the deﬁ  nition below) exceeds or falls below 50% of the normal level of tax receipts, the method is to be reviewed and the City Council informed of the results (sections 27 (1) and (2) and 79 (3) SBR).
Hamburg’s accounting system is based on the principles of state government double- entry bookkeeping. The budget plan includes the consolidated earnings plan (see section 27 SBR) and the double- entry consolidated ﬁ  nancial plan (see section 28 SBR); the budgetary account includes the consolidated proﬁ  t and loss account, the double- entry consolidated cash ﬂ  ow statement and the balance sheet (see section 77 (4) SBR). As a rule, in the 
consolidated earnings plan income should at least offset expenses (see section 27 (1) SBR). Cyclical adjustment is based on this offset. Borrowing and repayment are incoming and outgoing payments, which are estimated in the 
double- entry consolidated ﬁ  nancial plan. Borrowing is permitted if the consolidated earnings plan records a deﬁ  cit 
for cyclical reasons (section 28 (2) sentence 1 number 3 in conjunction with section 27 (3) number 2 SBR).Any estimated deviations in tax receipts from the normal level are recorded in the budget plan as a transfer to or withdrawal from the cyclical position and are booked on the basis of the actual budget outturn. The cyclical position is a sub- item of capital in the balance sheet. If the cyclical position has a positive value, this is deemed to be a “cyclical reserve”; if it has a negative value, it is termed a “cyclically induced prior strain on the balance sheet”.
A (planned or actual) deﬁ  cit due to a negative cyclical component (deviation from the value of the long- term trend 
in tax receipts) must be covered by a withdrawal from the cyclical reserve. If there is no such reserve or if the reserve 
is insuﬃ   cient, a cyclically induced prior strain on the balance sheet may be recorded (Drucksache 20/ 8400, page 59). Borrowing is permitted to ﬁ  nance the deﬁ  cit in the consolidated earnings plan resulting from the fact 
that tax receipts fall below the normal level (section 28 (2) sentence 1 number 3 SBR). However, the borrowing authorisation can be used only if the deﬁ  cit also occurs in the consolidated proﬁ  t and loss account (ie if it is actually incurred) (section 79 (6) SBR).
Results at budget outturn for 2015 and 2016
2015:  normal level: €9.3 billion, actual tax receipts: €9.8 billion, cyclical component: +€0.5 billion (+5.2% of 
normal level).
2016: normal level: €9.9 billion, actual tax receipts (and thus the cyclical component) are currently not available.

Tax- smoothing methods (con’t)
 
State/Legal basis Description of method
Rhineland- 
PalatinateAct implementing Article 117 of the Constitution of Rhineland- Palatinate (RP Act); State Regu-lation on the method to determine the cyclical component pursuant to section 3 (2) sentence 1 of the Act implementing Article 117 of the Constitution of Rhineland- Palatinate (Reg)Method to calculate the cyclical componentThe normal level (referred to as “structural tax revenue” in the legal regulations) for 2011 is set at the amount of structural tax revenue (€9.8 billion) determined over a past period. For the years thereafter, the amount is extrapolated using geometric mean growth in tax revenue, adjusted for legislative changes, for the eight years prior to the budget year (standard extrapolation factor pursuant to section 3 (1) and (2) Reg).To ensure that the cyclical components are symmetrical, the extrapolation rate is adjusted by a correction amount in certain circumstances (see below) (section 6 (1) and (2) Reg).
Adjustment for the ﬁ  nancial impact of changes in tax legislation
The impact of changes in tax legislation is adjusted for when determining the standard extrapolation factor and is factored into the extrapolation. Legislative changes can be recognised as soon as it is highly likely that they will be 
implemented and their ﬁ  nancial impact can be forecast with suﬃ   cient accuracy. If these prerequisites are not met, 
deductions can be made (section 3 RP Act; section 4 (3) and (4) Reg).
Control mechanisms to ensure symmetry
The cyclical components are recorded in a symmetry account at budget outturn. The standard extrapolation factor for the normal level (F, standard extrapolation rate: F-1) is raised (lowered) by a correction amount (ΔF) if both the annual and cumulated cyclical deviation in the prior year is positive (negative) and the cumulated cyclical deviation (K) in the amount exceeds 1% of tax revenue in the prior year (S(t-1)). The correction amount is then calculated as 
one- eighth of the difference between the latter two amounts up to a maximum of 80% of the standard extrapolation rate (ΔF=min{1/ 8*(K/S(t-1)-0.01), 0.8*(F-1)}). The extrapolation rate for the normal level is always 
raised (lowered) by 80% if the annual cyclical component for the prior year is positive (negative) and the amount thereof exceeds 5% of tax revenue in the prior year and, at the same time, the cumulated cyclical deviation for the prior year is positive (negative) (section 6 (1) and (2) Reg).
Results at budget outturn for 2015 and 2016
2015:  normal level: €12.0 billion, actual tax revenue: €12.0 billion, cyclical component: +€0.03 billion (+0.3% of 
normal level).

Tax level methods
Mecklenburg-West PomeraniaSection 18 (2) to (5) SBR; sections 1 ff of the Act establishing a special fund “ Cyclical offset  reserve for the  federal state of Mecklenburg- West  Pomerania” (MWP Act)Method to calculate the cyclical component
In a ﬁ  rst step, the revenue levels in each of the ﬁ  ve years prior to the budget year are increased by an inﬂ  ation 
component based on the change in the nationwide consumer price index up to the budget year. The normal level (referred to as the “normal situation” in the legal regulations) corresponds to the average of the values adjusted for inﬂ  ation in this way (section 18 (2) SBR).
Adjustment for the ﬁ  nancial impact of changes in tax legislation
Adjustment is made for the ﬁ  nancial impact of changes in tax legislation that came into force in the two years prior to the budget year (t-2 for budget year t) (section 18 (2) SBR).
Control mechanisms to ensure symmetry, non- standard features
An explicit control is envisaged only for the repayment of cyclically induced loans.The conservative approach to determining the normal level (disregarding effects of real growth and income tax progression) mostly produces cyclical surpluses.The option of taking up “cyclically induced loans” is additionally limited: future borrowing within the core budget is prohibited unless the negative deviation from the normal level exceeds 3%. A deviation of up to 3% from the normal level (deﬁ  cit) is to be covered as far as possible by a withdrawal from a newly established special fund (cyclical offset reserve, with no borrowing authorisation); borrowing authorisations in the core budget are possible only for the excess part of the deﬁ  cit. As a rule, any loans resulting from these borrowing authorisations must be repaid as soon as a “cyclical normal situation” recurs (3% band around the normal level). If revenue exceeds the normal level by more than 3%, the excess amount must be used (ﬁ  rst) to repay cyclically induced loans and then to top up the cyclical offset reserve up to its benchmark of €500 million (section 18 (2) to (5) SBR; MWP Act).Fluctuations within the cyclical normal situation can be offset by transfers to and withdrawals from the cyclical offset reserve as long as the reserve does not fall below the minimum level of €200 million. Once the benchmark is reached, cyclically induced additional revenue can also be earmarked for spending (sections 3 and 4 MWP Act).As long as the fund does not slip below its minimum level, it can also be used to offset revenue shortfalls as a result of changes in tax legislation (section 4 MWP Act).
Results at budget outturn for 2015 and 2016
2015:  normal level: €4.8 billion, actual tax revenue: €5.4 billion, cyclical component: +€0.6 billion (+11.8% of 
normal level).
2016:  normal level: €5.1 billion, actual tax revenue: €5.5 billion, cyclical component: +€0.5 billion (+9.2% of 
normal level).

Tax- smoothing methods (con’t)
 
State/Legal basis Description of method
Saxony
Article 95 (4) of the State Constitution (SC); section 18 SBRMethod to calculate the cyclical componentThe normal level (referred to as the “normal situation” in the legal regulations) is the average tax revenue for the four years prior to the budget year (Article 95 (4) SC; section 18 (3) SBR).
Adjustment for the ﬁ  nancial impact of changes in tax legislation
Adjustment is made for the ﬁ  nancial impact of changes in tax legislation and other unspeciﬁ  ed “material structural 
developments […] based on recognised and logical factors” (section 18 (3) SBR).Control mechanisms to ensure symmetry, non- standard features
An explicit control is envisaged only for the repayment of cyclically induced loans. Cyclical components are not recorded unless they give rise to a borrowing need.The conservative approach to determining the normal level (disregarding effects of nominal growth and income tax progression) mostly produces cyclical surpluses. However, cyclically induced additional revenue can be earmarked for spending as long as (unspeciﬁ  ed) adequate reserves have been set up.Taking up “cyclically induced loans” is permissible only if tax revenue falls more than 3% below its normal level. As a rule, proceeds from these loans can top up revenue only to a maximum of 99% of the normal level of tax revenue (Article 95 (4) SC; section 18 (1) SBR).If recalculations in the light of tax outturns mean that the borrowing scope or repayment obligation is lower than initially projected in the relevant budget plan, deviations must be offset in the next budget plan. Cyclically induced loans are to be repaid as soon as possible and within eight years at the latest (section 18 (5) and (6) SBR).
Results at budget outturn for 2015 and 2016
2015:  normal level: €11.4 billion (provisional, taken from the Budget Act), actual tax revenue: €12.8 billion, cyclical 
component: +€1.4 billion (+12.0% of normal level).
2016:  normal level: €11.7 billion (provisional, taken from the Budget Act), actual tax revenue: €13.5 billion, cyclical 
component at budget outturn: oﬃ   cial ﬁ  gures not yet available.
ThuringiaSection 18 (2) and (3) SBRMethod to calculate the cyclical componentThe normal level is calculated as average revenue in the three years prior to the year in which the budget is drawn up (section 18 (2) SBR).Non- standard feature of the cyclically sensitive tax revenue aggregate: general supplementary central government grants are disregarded (section 18 (2) SBR).
Adjustment for the ﬁ  nancial impact of changes in tax legislation
No.
Control mechanisms to ensure symmetry, non- standard features
An explicit control is envisaged only for the repayment of cyclically induced loans. Cyclical components are not recorded unless they give rise to a borrowing need.The conservative approach to determining the normal level (disregarding effects of nominal growth and income tax progression) mostly produces cyclical surpluses. The binding deadline for repayment of cyclically induced loans 
is set at ﬁ  ve years and begins in the ﬁ  rst budget year in which the budget plan can be balanced without taking up 
loans. For years in which a borrowing authorisation is granted, repayment can be postponed (section 18 (3) SBR).
Results at budget outturn for 2015 and 2016
2015:  normal level: €5.9 billion, actual tax revenue: €6.4 billion, cyclical component: +€0.5 billion (+8.7% of 
normal level).
2016:  normal level: €5.9 billion, actual tax revenue: €6.8 billion, cyclical component: +€0.9 billion (+15.6% of 
normal level).
