Underlying trends
Recovery in the German economy made not-
able progress in the third quarter of 2009, al-
though the currently available indicators
show that it is likely to have lost momentum
at the beginning of the fourth quarter. For
example, the volume of orders as well as out-
put in industry in October were both down
on the month after seasonal and calendar
adjustment. This is not unusual in the early
phase of a cyclical recovery, however, espe-
cially as growth had been quite strong in the
two preceding months.
The economy is still benefiting from the pick-
up in enterprises’ export business. Private
consumption will probably continue to have a
dampening impact in the fourth quarter,
however. This is due mainly to the fact that,
following the discontinuation of the govern-
ment’s environmental premium, business in
new private cars is nowhere near as buoyant
as it was in the second and third quarters. In
addition, consumers were assessing their
income prospects more cautiously during the
period under review despite the ongoing
favourable price climate and the no more
than moderate decline in employment even
at the beginning of the fourth quarter.
Industry
Industrial output declined by a seasonally ad-
justed 1.6% in October following a very sharp
increase in September (3.7%). Despite the
downturn, which was also due to special sec-Continuation of

6toral factors, the trend recovery in industrial
activity is still intact. Industrial output was
11/C252% up on the average of the third quarter.
While manufacturers of intermediate goods
saw their production figures improve for the
sixth month in succession, there were some
pronounced losses in the capital and consumer
goods sectors compared with output in Sep-
tember. Along with mechanical engineering,
the automotive sector and, to a somewhat
lesser extent, the food production industry,
these losses were concentrated primarily on in-
dustrial sectors which had recorded fairly
strong growth in September. Owing to a base
effect, the year-on-year decline in output nar-
rowed further and stood at 131/C252%i nO c t o b e r
after adjustment for calendar effects.
Industry did not receive any further demand
stimuli in October either. Following quite a
sharp increase in the flow of orders in the
preceding seven months, there was a season-
ally adjusted decline of 2.1% compared with
September. This was due mainly to the fact
that orders in the automotive sector and in
some of its supply sectors fell substantially
following the discontinuation of the special
fiscal policy programmes that stimulated car
sales both in Germany and other countries.
Nevertheless, the underlying upward trend
continued in other major industrial sectors.
For example, the volume of orders placed
with manufacturers of intermediate and con-
sumer goods in October was higher than in
the third quarter; in the capital goods sector
– excluding motor vehicles and exceptional
large orders – losses remained moderate, too.

tending to be slightly weaker at the begin-Economic conditions in Germany*

7ning of the fourth quarter – as in the previous
month – after relatively buoyant ordering ac-tivity in July and August. The flow of exportorders declined somewhat more sharply com-pared with its elevated level in September,with the drop in orders from other euro-areacountries being larger than in the case ofnon-euro-area countries. The overall volumeof orders in October was down by a calendaradjusted 8
1/C252% on its already cyclically de-
pressed level 12 months earlier.
While there was a slight seasonally adjusted
fall in the value of domestic sales of industrialgoods in October, there was, at 2.5%, a fur-ther sharp rise in nominal exports of goodsfollowing an increase of 3.6% in the Septem-ber. By contrast, imports of goods failed tomaintain their high September level anddeclined by 2.4%. The foreign trade surpluswent up to 313 billion in October.
ConstructionConstruction output fell by a seasonally ad-
justed 2.4% in October. This followed amonth-on-month decline in September, con-struction output having also been boosted inAugust by the effects of the public holidays.This means that construction activity does notyet reflect the fact that orders in the thirdquarter – more recent figures are not yetavailable – were 1.1% up on the precedingthree-month period.
Labour marketThe labour market is still proving to be sur-
prisingly robust. According to provisional fig-ures released by the Federal Statistical Office,
the number of persons in work in Octobershowed hardly any decline on the month. Theyear-on-year decline increased slightly to-0.4%. The number of employees subject tosocial security contributions also showed onlya small decrease in September. The numberof new registrations for short-time work inOctober went down to 105,000, comparedwith 118,000 in September. The BA-X indexfor job vacancies subject to regular socialsecurity contributions is rising slowly from adepressed level. There was a further improve-ment in the Ifo employment barometer fortrade and industry, although it was still incontractionary territory. Job cuts in this sectorare therefore likely to continue at a moderatepace.
Unemployment – based on the current statis-
tical definition – showed a further slight sea-sonally adjusted fall of 7,000 to 3.42 million inNovember. Excluding the changeover in thelabour market statistics, however, the un-employment figure would have risen byaround 10,000 on the month. The unemploy-ment rate in the reporting period, at 8.1%,was 0.5 percentage point up on the year. InNovember, there was a marked fall in theseasonally adjusted number of persons whowere newly registered as looking for work butnot yet unemployed; this suggests that therewill be no abrupt deterioration in the labourmarket situation in the coming months.

8lowing a rise up to the middle of October.
This is likely to have been due to the continu-
ing subdued demand for oil outside Asia and
the expansion of oil production in the OPEC
countries. At US$773/C254on a monthly average,
the price of crude oil (Brent) in November
was still 51/C254% higher than in October. In the
light of new information on oil inventories in
the United States, the spot price fell markedly
of late and stood at US$721/C252as this report
went to press. Prices for future deliveries of
crude oil were still being quoted with marked
premiums; US$4 and US$101/C254were being
charged for six-month and 18-month deliver-
ies respectively.
Prices at the upstream stages of the economy
presented a mixed picture in October. There
was a marked seasonally adjusted rise in the
cost of energy imports owing to the fact that
crude oil prices were still rising initially. This
contrasted with a fall in the prices of inter-
mediate goods and of capital and consumer
goods. In the case of imports, where price
movements undergo larger fluctuations, prices
went up by an average of 1.0% on the month
after seasonal adjustment. The year-on-year
decline went down to -8.1%. The import price
index was revised downwards for the period
from January to September; as a result, the
annual rate stood at -11.4% in September. If
this adjustment is excluded, the figure would
have been -11.0%. Despite similar price move-
ments in the sub-components but since crude
oil products have less importance, the produ-
cer prices of industrial products showed a
slight seasonally adjusted month-on-month
fall of 0.1%, however. This signified an un-
changed year-on-year figure of -7.6%.Consumer prices went up by a seasonally
adjusted 0.1% in November following a
slight increase of 0.2% in October. The
prices of fuel rose sharply as a result of the
higher crude oil prices on a monthly average.
Seasonal food items and dairy products like-
wise became considerably more expensive.
By contrast, the sub-index of other goods
recorded a (temporary) marked fall owing
to the insolvency-induced clearance sale of
one mail-order company. Prices of services
remained virtually unchanged, however. The
rise in rents remained moderate. Overall
consumer prices in November, according to
the national consumer price index, were
0.4% up on the year after remaining un-
changed in October. The annual rate of infla-
tion according to the Harmonised Index of
Consumer Prices (HICP) was +0.3%, com-
pared with -0.1% in October.
Public finances1
Statutory health insurance scheme
The statutory health insurance system (the
health insurance institutions and the health
insurance fund) posted a small surplus of 31/C254
billion in the third quarter of 2009. A deficit
of31/C252billion was recorded in the same period
of 2008. While expenditure growth acceler-
ated to 7%, receipts rose at an even stronger
pace (9%) despite the contribution rate being

9cut from 15.5% to 14.9% in mid-2009, thus
bringing it in line with the average rate for2008. The additional revenue mainly resultedfrom an extra 33 billion being transferred
from the central government budget.
2By
contrast, contribution receipts increased by aslittle as just over 1%, with contributions forrecipients of wage substitutes and the sharppension increase on 1 July 2009 having a sta-bilising effect.
Outpatient treatment (+8
1/C252%) and hospital
treatment (+71/C252%) once again made the larg-
est contributions to the strong expenditureincrease. Parliament played a decisive part inthis with the new remuneration arrange-ments for non-hospital doctors and theprovisions of the Hospital Financing ReformAct ( Krankenhausfinanzierungsreformgesetz ),
notably the pass-through of half of the nego-tiated pay increases for 2008 and 2009 to thehealth insurance institutions. Overall, expend-iture is continuing to rise at a much strongerpace than wages and salaries that are subjectto compulsory contributions. In the absenceof countermeasures, this will ultimately ne-cessitate higher contributions from insureesor additional tax grants.
The statutory health insurance system record-
ed a cumulative positive balance of just under31
1/C252billion up to the end of September.3By
contrast, a similar-sized deficit was recordedone year previously. However, the financialimprovement is due exclusively to centralgovernment transfers. At 37 billion to date,
these have been just over 35
1/C252billion higher
than for the first nine months of 2008.In the current system, the health insurance
fund bears the revenue risk, while the healthinsurance institutions bear the expenditurerisk. If the fund’s contribution receipts arelower than expected, it must neverthelessmake the payments set in advance to thehealth insurance institutions. Any gaps mustbe offset by reserves or additional centralgovernment funds, which have been grantedas loans up to now. Conversely, if the fundFinances of the statutory

2Until 2008, the central government grant was trans-
ferred in two tranches in the second and final quarters
(32.5 billion in total in 2008). Now, these tranches, which
were increased to a total of 34 billion in 2009, plus the
financial compensation for the cut in the contribution
rate of just over 33 billion (in the second half of 2009) are
paid in regular monthly instalments. For the purpose of
safeguarding liquidity, parts of the central government
grant were transferred in advance.

10records a surplus, this is to be used to top up
reserves or repay central government loans. By
contrast, if expenditure is higher or lower than
expected, the health insurance institutions
record corresponding deficits or surpluses. In
these cases, the health insurance institutions’
reserves form the financial buffer. Further-
more, the institutions can demand additional
contributions from their respective members.
Given unbiased forecasts, overestimates and
underestimates should cancel each other out.
By the end of 2009, central government will
have increased its planned grants by 31/C254bil-
lion only, bringing them to 37.2 billion in
total. However, owing to end-of-year bonus
payments, contribution receipts will be higher
in the fourth quarter. At the end of 2009, the
health insurance fund is likely to require
hardly any assistance from central govern-
ment loans for the purpose of safeguarding
liquidity. One reason for this is that part of
the fund’s transfers to the health insurance
institutions for December will not be made
until January 2010. If expenditure is allocated
to the period in which it accrues, the fund is
nevertheless likely to record a deficit. By con-
trast, the surplus that the health insurance in-
stitutions have accrued to date will decline
because the fund transfers equal monthly in-
stalments and experience has shown that ex-
penditure is relatively high in the final quarter.
In 2010, the fund could record higher revenue
than previously expected owing to the more
favourable forecasts vis-/C224-vis both wages and
salaries and employment, thus accelerating
the planned increase in the fund’s reserves.
Transfers to the health insurance institutionshave been approved based on the fund’s cur-
rent revenue estimate. However, if expend-
iture growth continues unabated these will
not be enough to cover the institutions’ costs.
As long as resources from the health insur-
ance fund finance at least 95% of the fore-
cast expenditure by the health insurance insti-
tutions both for the current year and for what
is planned for next year, the uniform contribu-
tion rate will not be adjusted. To make up for
any shortfalls, health insurance institutions
can, as a general rule, use their reserves or de-
mand additional contributions.
In addition to the 311.8 billion already
planned, central government intends to set
aside a further 33.9 billion for the statutory
health insurance scheme to offset cyclically-
induced revenue shortfalls. However, the ex-
pansion in the deficit is also due to rises in ex-
penditure that are ultimately politically
induced. As with the Federal Employment
Agency, there is thus also a danger of the
health insurance scheme being increasingly
financed through tax revenue on an ad hoc
basis. In accordance with the insurance
principle, central government grants ought to
cover only the volume of non-insurance-
related benefits. However, in light of the
non-income-related insurance benefits and
income-related contributions, the insurance
principle in the statutory health insurance
system is comparatively weak. This situation
could be changed by means of a fundamental
reform, under which the desired redistribu-
tion of income occurs in a more transparent
and appropriate manner via the tax and
transfer system and the tax-like nature of the
contributions is limited.Despite deficit,

11Public long-term care insurance scheme
In the third quarter, the public long-term care
insurance scheme recorded a small surplus,
which was somewhat down on the year. Em-
ployed persons’ contributions, which in-
creased by just under 1%, reflect the un-
favourable macroeconomic development to a
limited extent only, as its impact was signifi-
cantly dampened by higher contributions for
recipients of wage substitutes and pensions.
Overall revenue grew by just over 2%. Ex-
penditure increased by just under 6%. The
strong growth in expenditure continued after
benefits had already been extended in mid-
2008 as part of the long-term care reform.
The positive balance in the first nine months
came to just over 31/C252billion. Reserves
amounted to just under 341/C252billion at the
end of September. In the fourth quarter, a
surplus is also expected owing to contribu-
tions from end-of-year bonus payments. On
1 January 2010, as stipulated by law, the
long-term care benefit rates will be raised
again significantly.4If unemployment were to
rise and, above all, if more people were to
switch to receiving unemployment benefit II,
this would result in noticeable revenue short-
falls. Overall, the public long-term care insur-
ance scheme’s fiscal balance is already likely
to deteriorate significantly in 2010. In add-
ition to cyclical strains, the public long-term
care insurance scheme faces considerable
financing problems owing to the foreseeable
demographic development. Consequently,
based on the legislative status quo , it will be
necessary to significantly raise the contribu-
tion rate over the longer term.Securities markets
Bond market
In October 2009, issuance on the German
bond market amounted to 3104.9 billion in

the previous month). After deducting re-
demptions and taking account of changes in
issuers’ holdings of their own bonds, the
volume of outstanding domestic bonds de-
creased by 36.7 billion, however, compared
with net redemptions of 320.8 billion in Sep-
tember. Additionally, in October, foreign debt
securities totalling 36.4 billion were issued inFinances of the public long-

12net terms. On balance, therefore, 30.3 billion
was repaid to investors.
German credit institutions reduced their bond
market debt by 313.3 billion in October. This
primarily involved net redemptions of public
Pfandbriefe ( 35.0 billion), other bank debt
securities, which can be structured particular-
ly flexibly, ( 34.1 billion) and debt securities
issued by specialised credit institutions ( 33.7
billion) as well as, although to a lesser extent,
mortgage Pfandbriefe ( 30.5 billion).
In the month under review, the public sector
raised 33.7 billion in the capital market. This
was mainly attributable to borrowing by the
Federal states, which issued debt securities
totalling 33.7 billion. Conversely, the out-
standing amount of Federal government debtinstruments only increased marginally in net
terms ( 30.1 billion). The Federal government
primarily issued two-year Federal Treasury
notes (Sch/C228tze) as well as thirty-year and ten-
year Federal bonds (Bunds) totalling 39.9 bil-
lion, 32.0 billion and 31.1 billion respectively.
By contrast, five-year Federal notes (Bobls)
were redeemed to the tune of 312.3 billion
net, as were, to a lesser extent, Federal
Treasury financing paper and Federal Treasury
discount paper (Bubills), where net redemp-
tions amounted to 30.4 billion and 30.1 bil-
lion respectively.
In October, German enterprises tapped the
bond market for 32.8 billion compared with
34.7 billion in the previous month. In net
terms, this involved bonds with original
maturities of more than one year only.
Domestic non-banks were the sole net pur-
chasers in October, acquiring bonds for 37.7
billion on balance. This was focused on
foreign bonds, which saw purchases totalling
310.7 billion, while net sales of domestic
bonds were 33.0 billion. German credit insti-
tutions reduced their exposure by 34.5 billion,
the majority of which constituted foreign
bonds overall. Foreign investors sold German
bonds worth 33.4 billion net.
Equity market
In the month under review, domestic enter-
prises – almost all of which were listed com-
panies – issued 30.9 billion worth of new
shares in the German equity market. By con-

Mutual fund shares
In October, domestic mutual funds recorded
net inflows of 36.6 billion compared with
38.5 billion in September. Specialised funds
reserved for institutional investors were the
sole beneficiaries, while funds open to the
general public suffered slight outflows ( 30.1
billion). In particular, shares in open-end real
estate funds were redeemed ( 30.9 billion),
followed by money market funds ( 30.2 bil-
lion) and bond-based funds ( 30.1 billion). By
contrast, equity-based funds were able to sell
shares ( 30.5 billion), as were mixed securities-
based funds ( 30.3 billion) and mixed funds
(30.2 billion). Foreign funds traded in the
German market sold shares totalling 31.9 bil-
lion. On balance, mutual fund shares were
purchased exclusively by German non-banks
(39.0 billion). Conversely, foreign investors
sold German mutual fund shares ( 30.5 bil-
lion).
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur-
plus – in unadjusted terms – of 311.0 billion
in October 2009. The result was thus 31.7 bil-
lion up on the level of the previous month.
This was primarily due to a rise in the trade
surplus. However, there was also an increase
in the deficit on invisible current transactions,which comprise services, income and current
transfers.
According to provisional figures from the Fed-
eral Statistical Office, in October the foreign
trade surplus increased by 33.2 billion on the
month to 313.6 billion. After adjustment for
seasonal and calendar variations, it increased
by the same amount to 312.9 billion. The
value of exports rose by 2.5% while the value
of imports declined by 2.4%. Compared with
the third-quarter average, seasonally adjusted
nominal exports rose much more sharply
(+4.0%) than imports (+1.4%).
The deficit on invisible current transactions in
October was 31.8 billion, after 30.3 billion in
September. This shift was due to an increase
in net expenditure in current transfers of 32.3
billion to 35.2 billion, which was larger than
the reduction of the deficit on services (by
30.6 billion to 31.4 billion) and the rise in net
receipts from cross-border income (by 30.2
billion to 34.8 billion).
In October, cross-border portfolio investment
resulted in net capital exports of 38.5 billion,
compared with 34.2 billion in September.
This development was attributable largely to
transactions by resident investors, who added
foreign instruments with a total value of 36.4
billion to their portfolios. These were mainly
debt securities ( 36.4 billion). In addition, resi-
dent investors acquired foreign mutual fund
shares ( 31.9 billion) and sold shares to the
same value. Non-resident investors slightly
lowered their overall portfolio investment
in Germany ( 32.1 billion). In doing so, they
mainly sold bonds and notes ( 311.2 billion).Sales and

14By contrast, non-resident investors purchased
money market instruments ( 37.8 billion) and
shares ( 31.8 billion).
Direct investment resulted in net capital ex-
ports in October ( 33.5 billion). The main rea-
son for this was investment by German enter-
prises abroad ( 34.9 billion). Intra-group loans
played a major role in this, as did a slight rais-
ing of equity capital and reinvested earnings.
Foreign enterprises supplied their resident af-
filiates with 31.4 billion in additional finance,
primarily in the form of short-term financial
credits.
Other statistically recorded investment com-
prising financial and trade credits (where
these do not constitute direct investment) as
well as bank deposits and other assets saw
net capital exports of 34.6 billion in October.
Funds in the amount of 39.2 billion flowed
out from non-banks, in net terms solely
through transactions by enterprises and
households ( 311.4 billion). By contrast, the
activities of general government led to net
capital imports ( 32.2 billion). In the banking
system, additional inflows worth 34.5 billion
were generated. Resident credit institutions
recorded capital outflows of 320.5 billion,
however, and thus built up mainly short-term
external exposures. The Bundesbank, by con-
trast, saw its external position fall by 325.1
billion – principally in connection with trans-
actions conducted within the large-value pay-
ment system TARGET2.

15Outlook for the
German economy –
macroeconomic
projections
for 2010 and 2011There has been a perceptible improve-
ment in the outlook for the Germaneconomy in recent months. Following
the severe slump in the latter part of
2008 and the early part of 2009, a pro-cess of recovery began in the second
quarter of 2009. This was bolstered byextensive monetary and fiscal policymeasures and is likely to continue, al-beit at a somewhat more moderatepace, over the next two years. While
the effects of the government stabilisa-tion measures will probably wanegradually, endogenous market forceswill gain in importance. In this baselinescenario, real gross domestic product(GDP) will increase by 1.6% in 2010and by 1.2% in 2011, compared with a4.9% decline this year. The labour mar-ket response to the contraction ofeconomic activity has been extremelysubdued up to now. An abrupt fall inemployment is not to be expected forthe next two years either. Instead,there is more likely to be a protractedphase of adjustment. Under these con-ditions, the official unemploymentfigure of 3.4 million in 2009 could goup to 3.8 million in 2010 and to 4.2 mil-lion in 2011. The price climate remainsfavourable; there will probably be nomore than a moderate rise in consumerprices over the next two years of 0.9%in 2010 and 1.0% in 2011.

16Current situation
The German economy is gradually picking up
from the severe slump it experienced in thelatter part of 2008 and early part of 2009.
Seasonally and calendar-adjusted real GDProse by 0.7% in the third quarter followingan expansion of 0.4% in the second quarter.However, aggregate output remains at a lowcyclical level. While it was buoyed in thesecond quarter mainly by private consump-
tion, with car purchases, in particular, soar-ing, it was additionally lifted in the third quar-ter by stimuli from the external sector for thefirst time in over a year. Real exports of goodsand services rose by 3.4% in seasonally andcalendar-adjusted terms. This was notablydriven by a marked pick-up in exports to EUcountries following an earlier rise in demandfrom Asian countries in the second quarter.
Intermediate goods were in particular de-
mand, as were motor vehicles owing to thecar scrappage schemes introduced in manycountries. Domestic demand was bolsteredby the inventory cycle and higher fixed invest-ment, while private consumption remainedwell down on the quarter. Among the rea-sons why the spiralling slide in economic ac-tivity was replaced by an upturn not only inGermany but also in many other industrialcountries were the measures to stabilise thefinancial markets and also the resolute, rapidand comprehensive action taken by monetaryand fiscal policymakers.
Overall activity has been picking up more
quickly than was expected in the June projec-tion.
1Real GDP in the third quarter was no
less than 1.5% up on the level estimated inthe last forecast. On the demand side, thiswas due mainly to the more favourable devel-opment of exports and fixed investment,while private consumption was largely in linewith expectations.
In contrast to the expectation in the June pro-
jection, the labour market situation hasshown only little deterioration so far. The de-cline in employment came to a halt in thethird quarter of 2009, in fact, and the season-ally adjusted number of persons in work atthe end of the period under review was evenslightly up on the level at the beginning of2008. There were quite marked job losses inmanufacturing, although these were stillmoderate in comparison with the scale of theslump in production. This contrasted withclear gains in the case of public and privateservice providers. Employed persons’ averageworking hours fell somewhat further in sea-sonally and calendar-adjusted terms in thepast two quarters following a marked reduc-tion at the turn of 2008-09.
2Hourly product-
ivity recovered considerably more quickly
than expected in the June projection, above
all thanks to more favourable GDP growth.
Even so, this productivity measure was still1.5% down on the first quarter of 2008.

2Calculations from the components (employees and
self-employed) would show an increase in the averagenumber of hours worked for the third quarter. In the case
of employees, a further slight fall in the second quarter
– greater recourse to short-time working more than off-
set the declining use of working hours accounts – was
followed by a slight increase in the third quarter owing to

17The response of the labour market therefore
differs significantly from that in earlier periodsof recession. Before, there was no compar-able sagging of hourly productivity, even tak-ing into consideration its higher trend growthin previous years. While working hours tend-ed to be cut back more strongly than in earl-ier downturns, the adjustment of employ-ment was unexpectedly moderate given thescale of the downswing. Measured by thenumber of unemployed – even after correc-tion for the statistical changeovers – thisdevelopment was more favourable than inthe June projection as well as in comparisonwith past experience. This is all the moreremarkable especially in view of the excep-tionally sharp contraction of output.
The chief reason for this exceptional develop-
ment is presumably that employees andemployers alike have, so far, perceived advan-tages in maintaining existing employmentrelationships, even if this means acceptinglower income and profits. While government-subsidised short-time working has undoubt-edly been helpful in this respect, it is not play-ing the predominant role often ascribed to itby popular opinion.
3More decisive factors
are probably that working time arrangements
have progressively been made more flexible
over the past few years, that firms – given
their experience of an increasing shortage ofskilled labour in the last upturn – are now
keener to hold on to (often expensivelytrained) staff, and that employee representa-tives are more willing to compromise follow-ing the social and labour market reforms inthe first half of the decade. It is, first and fore-
most, the social partners in the manufactur-ing sector who have been exploring new av-
enues over the past few years and havegranted additional discretion to local negoti-
ators at plant level. Management and labourrepresentatives at many enterprises haveEmployment patterns

18been making use of this, as is revealed by the
surveys of the Institute for Employment Re-search (IAB) and the Institute of Economic
and Social Research (WSI).
Year-on-year inflation as measured by the
Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP)fell from +0.3% in the second quarter to-0.5% in the third quarter of 2009, whichwas largely consistent with the June projec-tion. While the increase in negotiated pay
levels almost perfectly matched that in theprojection, the wage drift on a monthly basiswas more strongly negative, which meantthat actual earnings decreased somewhatmore noticeably than expected.
Major assumptions
4
The global economy has now emerged from
its cyclical trough. The process of recovery,which began in the second quarter, strength-
ened in the third quarter of 2009. The exten-
sive fiscal packages adopted in many coun-tries and the non-standard monetary policy
measures taken by central banks continuedto generate powerful stimuli. This global re-covery is likely to continue during the fore-casting period. The Asian emerging markets,in particular, are likely to be centres of
growth. In most of the advanced economies,by contrast, the upturn will remain compara-tively moderate. This will be the case, notleast, because the various support measuresare of limited duration and will have a clearlywaning impact, at least from 2011. More-over, the structural adjustments only just initi-ated in some countries in the aftermath ofthe dramatic slump are still ongoing. Follow-ing a 1% decline this year, global outputcould increase by 3% in 2010 and 3
1/C252%i n
2011.
Compared with the boom years of the past,
world trade is likely to expand at quite a mod-
erate pace, too, during the projection period.With growth rates of 4
1/C254% in 2010 and
43/C254% in 2011, the trade intensity of global
activity will, however, be well below the earl-
ier – admittedly, extremely high – figures.
Above all, this is a reflection of a return to
normal following previously exceptionallybuoyant demand for tradable goods. Owing
to the rather subdued pace of growth in therest of the European Union, which accountsfor more than 60% of German exports, Ger-man exporters’ sales markets will expand lesssharply over the projection horizon than the
volume of global trade. Following a decline of12
3/C254% this year, German enterprises’ inter-
national sales markets are likely to grow by
31/C254% in 2010 and by just under 4% in 2011.
In comparison with the June projection, thisreveals a clear improvement in the business
outlook since German exporters’ sales market
growth for 2010 is now rated a good 3 per-centage points more favourably.
The projection is based on the technical as-
sumption of a constant euro exchange rate ofUS$1.49 over the forecasting horizon. This
implies a US dollar exchange rate that is 11%weaker than in the June projection. The nom-

19inal effective exchange rate of the euro
against the euro area’s 21 most importanttrading partners is likewise assumed to beconstant over the projection horizon and is3% higher than the average figure for 2008.This results in a moderate deterioration in theGerman economy’s hitherto good competi-tive position.
The interest rate assumptions derived from
market expectations are 1.2% for the three-month EURIBOR in 2010, which is unchangedfrom this year’s level. A short-term interestrate of 2.4% is expected for 2011. Accordingto current market assessments, the yield onlong-term German government bonds is like-ly to rise to 3.6% in 2010 and 4.1% in 2011,compared with 3.3% this year.
As in previous projections, interest rate
spreads on loans to enterprises were used togauge the likely effects of the financial crisison enterprises’ borrowing. These spreadshave narrowed further since the June projec-tion, which mirrors the fact that the spreadson minimum investment grade (BBB) corpor-ate bonds have been tending to show amarked fall, even though they remain at anelevated level by historical standards. Thefinding of the Bank Lending Survey (BLS) thatcredit standards have recently been tightened
again somewhat was likewise factored intothe corporate financing projection. For thecoming years, it is assumed that the situationin the financial markets will continue to easeand that Germany will not experience a gen-
eral credit crunch.Since the last low of around US$43 for a bar-
rel of Brent in February 2009, the spot priceof crude oil has rebounded sharply to reachalmost US$80 in mid-November. Taking for-ward quotations as a yardstick, this upwardmovement is likely to continue over the pro-jection horizon. The baseline scenario there-fore assumes a crude oil price of US$81.4 in2010 and of US$85.9 in 2011, comparedwith an average price of US$62.2 for a barrelof Brent in 2009. Owing to the marked de-
preciation of the US dollar against the euroover the past few months and under thegiven exchange rate assumptions, the relativeincrease in the euro price of crude oil in 2010is not expected to be as sharp. For the prices
of other commodities (excluding energy), anannual average reduction of more than one-fifth is assumed in 2009. In line with theMajor assumptions of the projection

20expectations of market players, the projection
is based on a further increase in prices inUS dollar terms of almost one-quarter in
2010. Other commodities could become
roughly 4% more expensive in 2011.
In the field of public finances, the projection
takes account of all measures which haveeither been adopted or which have alreadybeen specified in sufficient detail and are like-ly to be approved. In the area of taxation, this
relates primarily to measures to support theeconomy (including more generous depreci-ation allowances for enterprises and thelowering of income tax rates), the higher in-come tax allowances for contributions tohealth and long-term care insurance schemesfrom 2010, and the reintroduction of the ori-ginal, more generous commuting allowance.Due account was also taken of the new ar-
rangements in connection with the draft Act
to Accelerate Growth ( Wachstumsbeschleu-
nigungsgesetz ), which are to enter into force
at the beginning of 2010. Additional, as yetunspecified tax cuts for the period from 2011onwards, which were envisaged in the coali-tion agreement signed by Germany’s govern-ing parties, have not been included. For thesocial security funds, it was assumed that thestatutory health insurance institutions willdemand substantial additional contributionsin 2011. The projection also includes the in-crease in the Federal Employment Agency’scontribution rate to 3% scheduled for 2011and assumes a temporarily higher rate for in-solvency benefit contributions for 2010. Onthe expenditure side, the planned increase inchild benefit and the various modifications tothe statutory pension formula will have thegreatest impact. It was, furthermore, as-
sumed that there will be a temporary sharpexpansion in government investment, mainly
in 2010, in the context of the fiscal stimulus
packages. Finally, it was assumed that gov-ernment support measures for the financial
institutions will not have a significantly great-er impact on public finances in future than isalready the case.
Cyclical outlook
5
The cyclical upturn in Germany is set to con-
tinue. Given easing inventory pressure, theclear increase in orders received by industry in
recent months is likely to lead to a further ex-
pansion of production soon. This is reflectedin business expectations. According to the
latest surveys by the Ifo Institute for EconomicResearch and the German Chambers of In-dustry and Commerce (DIHK), business ex-pectations have now moved into neutral terri-tory, while respondents still take a more re-
strained view of the current situation. Enter-prises are predominantly basing their optimis-tic expectations on a further revival of exportdemand.
Growth is, however, unlikely to continue at its
current pace. For one thing, the boostingeffects of fiscal stabilisation measures in Ger-many and abroad on economic growth willgradually recede from the second quarter of2010 onwards. For another, the recent re-bound from the sharp slump in global outputand world trade is likely to lose momentum.

21The pace of macroeconomic growth is there-
fore likely to be moderate but steady during2010. Besides exports, public sector measureswill nonetheless continue to constitute themainstay of economic activity on an annualaverage. Endogenous domestic marketforces, which manifest themselves in greaterinvestment activity by enterprises, higher pri-mary income and rising consumption spend-ing by households, will probably make anincreasing contribution to growth over theprojection horizon. This is one reason why theoverall economic recovery should accelerateduring 2011, although public sector invest-ment will likely be cut back significantly asspending under the second fiscal stimuluspackage dries up. However, this rising quar-terly pattern is not directly reflected in the an-nual average. Owing to the statistical carry-over, the increase in average annual growthwill be higher in 2010 than in 2011. On acalendar-year basis, aggregate output couldexpand by 1.6% in 2010 and by 1.2% in2011, compared with a 4.9% contractionthis year. This corresponds to working-day-adjusted rates of change of -4.8% for 2009,1.4% for 2010 and 1.2% in 2011 and repre-sents an overall upward adjustment by almost3% of GDP for 2009 and 2010 comparedwith the June projection.
Following the collapse in demand that oc-
curred around the turn of 2008-2009, part ofthe production capacity in many plants wasidle. This will also have hurt macroeconomiccapacity utilisation at production plants. How-
ever, estimates of aggregate potential outputcapacity and its utilisation are always fraughtwith considerable uncertainty. This uncer-tainty has been aggravated by the sharp con-
traction in overall economic activity. Cautionshould therefore be applied when interpretingcorresponding quantitative estimates. In itsmacroeconomic analysis, the Bundesbank cal-culates potential output using a methodbased on production theory. This makes itpossible to calculate potential output growthand to conduct an economic interpretation ofthe supply-side determinants. It may thus beassumed that the economic crisis has impairedthe medium-term growth path through vari-ous channels (see box on pages 24-25). Al-though the scale of these negative effects issubject to very great uncertainty, it does seemplausible at present that potential output maygrow by only around
3/C254% in the next two
years. With regard to aggregate capacity util-
isation, the current underutilisation should
ease gradually over the projection horizon: ac-
cording to this calculation method, underutil-isation should fall to just under 3% in 2011,
compared with roughly 4% this year. It is alsostriking that, in 2008, capacity overutilisationof around 1
1/C252% was estimated. Alternative
methods involving statistical filter techniques,
which are also frequently applied in this con-
text, even yield a higher degree of overutilisa-
tion for 2008 and a smaller underutilisationfor the years 2009 to 2011.
Foreign demand for German products has
picked up again. From their cyclical low inFebruary, export orders had risen by no less
than 24% by September in price-adjustedterms. However, this still left them more thanone-quarter below their last cyclical high atthe end of 2007. Following a decline of al-most 15% this year, exports of goods andMarked output

22services are likely to rise by 41/C252% in 2010 and
41/C254% in 2011. In statistical terms, German
exporters will therefore benefit disproportion-
ately in both years as their sales markets ex-
pand. This is primarily the result of a positive
product range effect, as demand for capitaland intermediate goods – areas in which Ger-
man enterprises are particularly strong – islikely to recover robustly following the col-lapse of 2009.In the second and third quarters of 2009,
business investment moved slightly above thecyclical low it had marked at the beginning ofthe year. A cautious approach will probablybe taken to further investment plans initially,given low plant capacity utilisation. Fixed cap-ital formation by enterprises is unlikely to de-velop stronger momentum until 2011. The re-vival of investment activity will therefore lagthe general economic recovery slightly morethan was the case in past upturns.
The measures agreed in the two fiscal stimu-
lus packages will boost public sector invest-ment in 2010 as well as 2009. However, asthe measures are unwound and governmentinvestment budgets return to “normal” in2011, the level of public investment will dropsharply on the year. As a result, total grossfixed capital formation is likely to be

lower in 2011 than in 2010 – when it is fore-
cast to grow by just under 21/C252% – although
business investment will then point upwards,and housing construction could also increase
moderately – as in 2010.
The pronounced ups and downs of overall
economic activity have had a particularlystrong impact on stockbuilding over the pastone-and-a-half years. Having made a positivecontribution to economic growth in thesecond half of 2008 (which, given the sharp
drop in demand, can be interpreted as a signof involuntary stockbuilding), investment ininventories made a distinct negative contribu-tion to growth in the first half of 2009, whichindicates that stocks were considered toohigh and were therefore run down.

which implies that the inventory adjustmentprocess has been largely completed. No fur-ther strong effects are therefore likely fromdestocking and restocking in the projectionperiod. On an annual average for 2010,stockbuilding could, given the statisticalcarry-over, nevertheless lift economic growthby 0.3 percentage point in nominal terms,after making a negative contribution of 0.4percentage point this year. In 2011 stock-building is likely to have a neutral impact onthe level of economic activity.
In the year to date, the pattern of private
consumption and savings has been highly in-fluenced by the government environmentalpremium for scrapping old cars. After soaringpassenger car sales in the first half of theyear, demand waned perceptibly over thesummer, although the number of new carspurchased was still significantly greater than“normal”. It must be assumed that the im-pact of the environmental premium on de-mand will recede further over the next fewmonths and reverse next year. Householdspresumably used part of their savings to fundtheir earlier-than-planned purchases of motorvehicles. This has tended to depress the sav-ing ratio in 2009. It is likely to pick up againin 2010. Inflation, too, is slowly rising, which
means that real private consumer spendingwill probably be only slightly higher next yearthan this year despite households benefitingfrom further tax relief. As the saving ratioreturns to normal, inflation-adjusted private
consumption could rise by 1% in 2011.The labour market’s unusual response pattern
during the recent downturn makes forecast-ing future developments particularly difficult.Enterprises will not necessarily stick to theirinitial decision to avoid redundancies wherepossible despite the massive slump in sales.Much will depend on whether the Germaneconomy does actually recover at a moderatebut fairly steady pace – as assumed in thebaseline scenario of this projection. Therewould then be a good chance, however,
– and this is a central assumption in thepresent projection – that the social partners inthe manufacturing sector, which has been hitparticularly hard by the crisis, will find waysand means of preserving as many jobs as pos-
sible and largely avoiding mass lay-offs. Whilethe existing scope for reducing overtime andrunning down working time accounts has

24Deuts che Bun desbankTo what extent has the potential output of the German e conomy been impaire d
by the e conomi c an d ﬁ nan cial crisis? An interim assessment
In the ﬁ  nal quarter of 2008 an d the ﬁ  rst quarter of 2009, 
the German e conomy suffere d a severe slump in output as 
a result of the international e conomi c an d ﬁ nan cial crisis. 
The nature an d ma gnitu de of this sho ck su ggest that it was 
not merely a cyclical phenomenon, but that the me dium-
term growth path was also harme d. It is lar gely a ccepte d 
that the worl dwide re cession must also be viewe d in the 
light of the global im balan ces whi ch have been su bjected 
to an a ccelerate d corre ction sin ce the autumn of last year. 
In this context, the future via bility of business mo dels 
and the e conomi c value of pro duction capa cities alike 
are bein g reviewe d while the markets‘ sear ch an d sele c-
tion pro cesses are on goin g an d new stru ctures are partly 
recognisa ble only at a ru dimentary sta ge. Furthermore, 
temporary exa ggerations cannot be rule d out. Any state-
ments re garding potential output growth an d the output 
gap shoul d therefore be interprete d with great caution at 
present.
Judgment has a bearin g not only on the estimate d extent 
of loss but also on the time proﬁ  le over whi ch the fun-
damentals un derlyin g the development of output an d 
real in come mi ght deteriorate base d on a given e conomi c 
poli cy status quo . It is thus currently very difﬁ cult to assess 
whether the crisis will merely have a one-off level effe ct 
on potential output or whether it will affe ct the potential 
growth rate, too. It is not implausi ble that the level loss 
may be sprea d over a certain perio d. Also in view of the 
un certainty re garding the lon ger-term effe cts of the crisis, 
the overall impa ct of whi ch can only be gauged ex post , 
it is the temporary inﬂ  uen ce on the rates whi ch is bein g 
per ceive d in the current analysis.
The ﬁ  nan cial market crisis a bruptly en ded an exten ded 
perio d of extremely low risk premiums an d comparatively 
easy a ccess to credit worl dwide. The slump in global 
tra de an d the chan ges in international ﬁ  nan cial ﬂ ows 
calle d the international division of business that was 
esta blishe d durin g the boom years into question insofar 
as it contri bute d to the misallo cation of resour ces an d 
creation of ma cro economi c im balan ces. It may well take 
time for global output an d worl d tra de to return to a soli d 
me dium-term growth path. Many countries will pro bably 
suffer from stron g un derutilisation of pro duction capa ci-
ties or restru cturin g for quite a while. Owin g to its hi gh 
level of openness an d hi ghly spe cialise d ran ge of export 
goo ds, the German e conomy nee ds to a djust to this new 
global e conomi c scenario, too, althou gh opportunities coul d con ceiva bly arise. This pro cess of reorientation will 
not, however, fa ce the a dditional burden of havin g to cor-
rect stru ctural im balan ces in the domesti c real e conomy.
The, to date, very mo derate la bour market downturn an d 
the fa ct that business insolven cies have not ex ceeded the 
usual rate in times of re cession support the supposition 
that, for mu ch of the German e conomy, it may be possi ble 
to sprea d the a djustment burden over time, espe cially 
given the si gns of a burgeonin g cyclical global e conomi c 
recovery. This also means, however, that potential output 
growth coul d be very low in the comin g years. Parti cularly 
if dire ct capital sto ck losses, whi ch result from the e conomi c 
obsoles cence of existin g ﬁ xe d assets or ﬁ  rms’ market exit, 
turn out to be not too hi gh from a current perspe ctive an d, 
in a ddition, are likely to be sta ggere d over time, cap acity 
un derutilisation is currently expe cted to remain hi gh dur-
ing the proje ction perio d. Thus, business investment woul d 
be driven very little by the motive of capital sto ck expan-
sions in the foreseea ble future.
While the in crease d user cost of capital due to hi gher risk 
premiums will hamper the tren d development of both 
input fa ctors via s cale effe cts, it will also ensure a shift 
in optimal fa ctor allo cation in favour of la bour, provi ded 
that la bour costs an d pro ductivity reali gn in the me dium 
term. The full effe ct, whi ch dampens e quili brium output, 
will nonetheless stru cturally re duce total hours worke d in 
the business se ctor. Presuma bly of quantitatively greater 
importan ce, however, are the jo b losses whi ch are asso ci-
ate d with se ctoral reallo cation re quirements. Fa cilitate d 
by a variety of ﬂ  exi ble workin g time mo dels an d greater 
use of short-time workin g, companies have so far favoure d 
implementin g internal a djustment strate gies, also in view 
of hi gh ﬁ rin g an d rehirin g costs. In some se ctors of the 
economy, there are initial si gns of a re duction in colle c-
tively a gree d or normal weekly workin g hours whi ch are 
generally a gree d upon for a limite d time only but whi ch, 
at the current jun cture, are likely to be of a relatively 
persistent nature. This woul d depress potential output just 
as in the case of dire ct lay-offs but woul d curb the rise in 
stru ctural unemployment.
The potential la bour for ce coul d contra ct, as gloomier 
prospe cts of ﬁ  nding work discoura ge jo b seekers an d,

Althou gh the fall in workin g-age population will continue 
durin g the proje ction perio d, it will decelerate somewhat 
for a time.
The e conomi c an d ﬁ nan cial crisis has tri ggere d market 
restru cturin g, whi ch – on a se ctoral avera ge – will ten d 
to enhan ce pro ductivity. However, if domesti c resour ces 
are transferre d to the non-tra dable goo ds se ctor, total

ance. Moreover, the innovative stren gth of the e conomy 
coul d suffer if ﬁ  rms have insufﬁ  cient fun ds for resear ch

however, the willin gness of many companies to maintain 
their mostly well qualiﬁ ed core staff durin g the current 
downturn has provi ded a counterwei ght to the loss of 
(company-spe ciﬁ c) human capital.
Usin g the disa ggregate d estimation metho d base d on 
pro duction theory 1 an d in corporatin g proje ction results, 
potential output of the German e conomy will in crease 
by only aroun d ¾% per year over the proje ction horizon 
(in cluding 2009), assumin g that the effe cts of the crisis 
work throu gh the described channels an d economi c poli cy 
remains un chan ged. This estimate primarily reﬂ  ects the 
temporal a djustment pro cess towar ds a new e quili brium 
potential output level. However, the risk of permanent 
rate effe cts, too, is non-ne gligible. Owin g to persisten ce 
effe cts in the la bour market an d a sustaine d decline in 
expe ctations as a result, say, of delaye d budgetary consoli-
dation, the path of potential output may be ﬂ atter in the 
lon ger term as well. Ri gorous poli cy reforms are vital for 
reinvi goratin g weakene d growth fun damentals as they 
support the stru ctural chan ge brou ght a bout by the global

its course throu gh open an d ﬂ exi ble pro duct an d fa ctor 
markets. Any notions of in dustrial poli cy intervention 
shoul d be swiftly a bandone d.
Compare d with the annual rates of potential output 
growth in the last e conomi c upswin g, whi ch were lifte d by 
the positive tren d effe cts of corporate restru cturin g meas-
ures as well as the enhan ced ﬂ exi bility in colle ctive la bour 
agreements an d labour market reforms, these new ﬁ  gures indicate a cut of just over ½ per centa ge point in annual 
potential output growth.2 Supply-si de growth determinants 
will suffer sizea ble losses a cross the boar d. La bour, whi ch 
is a gain set to curtail potential output growth distin ctly, 
will initially be affe cted most, as workin g hours rea ct quite 
rapi dly. In the early sta ges, ﬁ xe d capital formation is likely 
to be espe cially affe cted by o bsoles cence effe cts, whereas 
weak investment will have a delaye d effe ct on the capital

whi ch, to gether with the other inﬂ  uen ces with an overall

Base d on these consi derations, the German e conomy 
coul d, in the wake of the e conomi c an d ﬁ nan cial crisis, 
suffer dire ct dama ge to potential output of at least 2 %

26now largely been exhausted and the use of
short-time working has likewise probably al-ready peaked, a temporary shortening of
regular weekly working hours is another ad-
justment mechanism which could increasinglybe employed.
Nonetheless, it must be assumed that, above
all, hourly productivity, but also workinghours, will pick up again and job losses will,
on balance, rise. The growing number of in-solvencies demonstrates that many enter-prises cannot be run profitably in the presentconditions despite employees making conces-sions. Although insolvencies need not neces-sarily result in a total loss of jobs, some redun-dancies will often probably be unavoidable. Inaddition, the increasing government debtburden will probably soon dampen the cre-ation of jobs in partly or largely publicly fi-nanced areas and halt it completely in themedium term.
At any rate, massive job cuts are unlikely in
the short term, at least according to surveysof works councils by the WSI and of enter-prises by the IAB, the DIHK and the Ifo Insti-tute. Moreover, statistics on the number ofpersons registering as looking for work butnot yet unemployed, which the Federal Em-ployment Agency regards as an importantleading indicator, also signal no deteriorationof the labour market situation over the nextfew months.

27and beyond. On balance, employment could
decline by 1.0% next year and by 1.2% thefollowing year (largely as a result of a nega-
tive statistical carry-over), after recording only
small losses on an annual average in 2009.Average working hours should rise somewhat
in 2011, but are likely to remain below pre-crisis levels. Average hourly productivity willincrease perceptibly with the adjusted labourinput and could return to pre-crisis levels to-wards the end of 2010. However, it is likely to
remain below the medium-term trend in2011.
Unemployment is likely to rise largely in line
with the falling level of employment over thenext two years. According to the projection’sbaseline scenario, the number of registeredunemployed will swell from 3.4 million in2009 to 3.8 million in 2010 and 4.2 million in2011. This equates to a rise in the unemploy-ment rate of almost 2 percentage points from8.2% to 10.1%. Measured against the levelof macroeconomic development over theprojection horizon, this would still imply amoderate increase, however, given the previ-ous massive slump.
Labour costs and price outlook
Employees will have to forgo pay rises if a
large number of jobs currently at risk are tobe preserved. Growth in negotiated wageswill slow markedly, from 2
1/C254% in 2009 to
slightly more than 11/C254% in 2010 and just
over 11/C252% in 2011. A considerable part of
the lower wage growth was already factored
into the wage agreements of 2009, whichmostly run for two years and frequently in-
clude one-off payments, but only very moder-ate linear wage increases. In addition, thewage drift on an hourly basis, which wasclearly positive in 2009 as working hourswere reduced without corresponding cuts tomonthly wages, will move into negative terri-
tory. On a monthly basis, employees willbenefit from the slight increase in averageworking times, as reduced working hours inresponse to the crisis had squeezed labour in-comes in 2009. Actual earnings per employee
could rise by 1% next year and 1
1/C252% the
following year after falling by1/C252% this year.
Social contributions will have a largely neutral
effect on balance. As working hours increase
again and hourly productivity recovers, real
GDP per employed person will grow byaround 2

28falling sharply by almost 5% in 2009. Unit la-
bour costs will consequently contract by atotal of 2
1/C252% in 2010 and 2011, after ex-
panding by 5% in 2009 in response to the cri-sis.
While the sharp increase in unit labour costs
in 2008-09 squeezed profit margins, their ex-pected reduction should give a correspondingboost to corporate earnings. This will prob-ably be partly countered by slightly rising im-port prices, which had readjusted sharplydownwards in 2009. On balance, the GDP
deflator, which measures the rate of price in-crease of domestic output, is likely to increaseonly moderately over the projection horizon.
Consumer prices overall will probably rise
moderately throughout the projection hori-zon, with the downward corrections toenergy and food prices now having run theircourse. By contrast, other durable and non-durable consumer goods prices should easegradually in line with producer price develop-ments and under the impact of global over-capacity, while services and rents are likely toreflect the flatter wage and income patterns.Excluding energy, inflation is therefore likelyto drop from 1.1% in 2009 to 0.8% in both2010 and 2011. As energy prices will poststronger growth, the headline rate of inflationcould total 0.9% in 2010 and 1.0% in 2011.
Public finances
The general government fiscal balance will
deteriorate significantly in 2009.
7While a bal-
anced budget was achieved in 2008, thisyear’s deficit is now expected to exceed the3% ceiling slightly. Roughly half of this deteri-oration can be attributed to the direct nega-tive influence of the economic downturn,
8
although this is mitigated by the fact that the
current macroeconomic profile is favourablefor public budgets. For instance, gross wages
and salaries, which are particularly important
for government revenues, are developingmuch less negatively than GDP as a whole.
On the other hand, receipts from profit-related taxes are likely to drop much morethan could be inferred from the patternof economic development and legislativechanges. At approximately 1
1/C254% of GDP ,
other factors, especially the fiscal stimulus
packages, are also having a major impact.
Government debt will probably rise to some
72% of GDP , not least owing to the measurestaken in support of financial institutions. This
compares with around 66% in 2008.
According to the current projection, public
finances will deteriorate substantially in 2010,
and the deficit could jump to around 5% ofGDP . Despite the economic recovery, cyclicalfactors will probably have a slight upward im-pact on the deficit as the growth structure
7The financial development of general government is
described here as defined in the national accounts; this
definition is also used largely as the basis for the fiscal ref-

29will be less favourable for public finances
than it has been this year. However, structuralfactors will be the main determinant fuelling
the deficit. For instance, the volume of discre-
tionary debt-financed measures will be con-siderably larger than in 2009, partly as a
result of the new arrangements in the coali-tion agreement which the German govern-ment plans to implement in 2010.
Whereas the revenue ratio will increase this
year thanks to the comparatively favourabledevelopment of the tax assessment basis, it islikely to decline perceptibly in 2010 owing tothe probable ongoing exceptional negativedevelopment of profit-related taxes, theunfavourable growth profile and, above all,the large-scale cuts in tax and social contribu-tions. Prominent among these are greater taxdeductibility of contributions to the healthand long-term care insurance schemes, therenewed lowering of income tax rates as partof the January 2009 fiscal stimulus packageand rising tax shortfalls as a result of changeddepreciation rules. By contrast, the expend-iture ratio could increase slightly further fol-lowing its explosive growth in 2009. This ex-pansion will be driven primarily by the newlyplanned additional increase in child benefit,higher spending on healthcare and pensionsas well as public sector investment. The ex-pected rise in the expenditure ratio will becushioned chiefly by the unwinding of tem-porary stimulus measures such as the pre-mium for scrapping old cars and the one-offchild bonus.
The deficit ratio could fall slightly in 2011,
chiefly on account of unwinding fiscal stimu-lus measures, provided no further measuresare implemented. This projection takes no ac-count of the additional tax cuts announced inthe coalition agreement. From the currentperspective, cyclical factors will have virtuallyno impact on the development of the fiscalbalance in 2011. General government debt islikely to balloon rapidly towards a level of80% of GDP .

30er as high as it was just a few months ago. It
cannot be ruled out that there will be furtherunwelcome surprises in the banking sector or
in the financial markets which put a brake on
the recovery process in the real economy anddestroy the optimism that has now grown.
Conversely, given favourable circumstances, itis quite possible that there will be a morerapid and stronger pick-up in the world econ-omy and in global trade.
The baseline scenario starts from the hypoth-
esis that the situation in the financial marketswill gradually improve and that – not leastowing to the precautions taken so far – therewill be no general credit crunch in Germany.Although loans to the domestic private sectordeclined in the third quarter of 2009, thereare no indications that supply-side restrictionsare the main reason for the subdued credit
growth. Various indicators continue to point
to weak growth in borrowing being duemainly to the fall in demand associated withthe economic downturn.
9This is also con-
firmed by past experience, which indicates
that credit demand lags developments in the
real economy to a certain extent at the begin-
ning of a macroeconomic recovery. Startingfrom a very low level of capacity utilisation,
enterprises can expand their production rela-tively sharply at first without immediatelyhaving to make new investment in fixedassets or obtain external financing. Added tothis is the fact that firms’ internal financing
sources typically also improve in such an earlyphase of economic recovery.
Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that
bank-imposed constraints may have a strong-er impact on lending going forward. Thedeleveraging in the German banking sectorsince the fourth quarter of 2008 – a processwhich is also continuing at the current end,albeit in weaker form – has focused so far onscaling back foreign assets, interbank expos-ures, equities as well as other variable-ratesecurities and less on lending to the domesticprivate sector. The longer the pressure to ad-just balance sheets continues and the morebanks’ capital base is eroded by additionalwrite-downs, the greater will be the risk thatthe downsizing of asset portfolios mightspread to loans to domestic non-financial cor-
porations. In a cyclical recovery phase whencredit demand will eventually rise again, theaccompanying supply-side restrictions couldhave a stifling impact and impede the up-swing.
The projections for global growth and world
trade start from the hypothesis that the trade
intensity of the global recovery will be com-paratively small in the next two years. It isalso possible, however, that, following thedisproportionately severe slump in global
trade this year, the subsequent cyclical rally ininternational trade will likewise be relatively
strong. German industry would benefit fromthis especially, and there would then be goodprospects that the output losses sustained in2009 might be regained faster than assumedin the baseline scenario.
According to the governing parties’ coalition
agreement, the new German government is

new income tax rates are scheduled to beintroduced on 1 January 2011, although thedetails are still to be settled. If the tax reformis implemented as scheduled, householdswould have more disposable income, butgeneral government would have an evenhigher borrowing requirement.
The labour market projection presented here
is based essentially on three assumptionswhich are fraught with uncertainty. First, it isexpected that the German economy will re-cover slowly and that it will not match thepre-crisis level of output within the projectionhorizon. For this reason, it will not be possibleentirely to maintain the current level of em-ployment. Second, it is assumed that therebound in output will be steady and withoutmajor disruptions and that expectations of alargely complete recovery over the mediumterm will remain intact. This should sustainenterprises’ interest in holding on to labourwhich is currently not working at full capacity.Third, it is assumed that the social partners inthe manufacturing sector will continue thecourse embarked on over the past few yearsof introducing innovative models for workinghours and remuneration. Many jobs would besafeguarded by employees forgoing pay rises
in order to take on part of the holding costs.Given a more rapid brightening of the out-look for the German economy, employmentlosses might then even be smaller than is as-sumed here. On the other hand, a further
economic setback accompanied by a deteri-oration in expectations would probably gen-erate perceptible pressure to cut jobs.On balance, the chances of a favourable de-
velopment in the real economy in Germany
outweigh the downside risks. A more rapidpick-up in global trade, in particular, couldgenerate stronger positive stimuli for the do-mestic economy. It is also conceivable thatbusiness investment has already bottomed
out and that the upturn in the course of nextyear will be more buoyant than forecast inthe baseline projection.Baseline and uncertainty

32By contrast, price risks stem in large part from
the vagaries of the international commodityand foreign exchange markets. Given that
global economic activity is gaining momen-
tum but has not yet firmed, crude oil pricesand the corresponding forward quotations
have already reached quite a high level that islikely to be based largely on expectations thatdemand will continue to rise rapidly. In viewof the current idle production capacities andlarge inventories, the energy price risks in the
projection’s baseline scenario are thereforemore likely to be neutral or slightly on thedownside. An unexpectedly strong revival inthe world economy could, however, drive upthe prices of crude oil and other commodities– especially agricultural commodities – more
quickly. According to the projection, lowerprices on the world markets and the appreci-
ation of the euro will increasingly make them-
selves felt as a positive factor in the case ofother goods; a marked deterioration in con-
sumer spending in Germany could furtherrestrict the scope for raising prices. Conver-sely, a faster improvement in the economicclimate could counteract the expected slowerrate of price increase for goods (excluding
energy and food). Much the same applies toservices. Overall, the risks for consumer pricesare to be assessed as largely neutral from thecurrent perspective.

33Financial integration
and risk sharing
in the euro area –
longer-term trends
and impact
of the financial crisisEuropean monetary union has been a
major driver of financial integration in
Europe. This process has taken place
against the backdrop of a general
trend towards financial globalisation.
Integrated financial markets offer the
economies involved potential effi-
ciency and welfare gains, and are also
of substantial importance to the
smooth implementation of monetary
policy in the euro area. However, these
benefits may also entail drawbacks
and macroeconomic costs in that, if
economic and financial crises occur in
closely integrated financial markets, a
faster regional spillover has to be ex-
pected. This report will analyse both
the process of the financial integration
of Germany and the euro area’s inte-
gration into the global economy.
Viewed from a longer-term perspec-
tive, financial market integration has
contributed to consumption smooth-
ing between the euro-area countries
through international risk diversifica-
tion. Moreover, during the last two
years the financial crisis has generated
a considerable impact on cross-border
asset positions, the real economic im-
plications of which cannot yet be fully
measured. All in all, it is clear that the
growing together of the capital mar-
kets during the last 20 years has re-
inforced interdependencies.

34Integration of the financial markets
worldwide and within Europe
The last few decades have seen a marked
worldwide rise in investors’ willingness to in-
vest across borders. This process offers invest-
ors and consumers a number of potential
economic advantages. For instance, a wider
range of financial instruments has created
additional investment opportunities allowing
investors to spread their income risk. The
benefits of improved risk diversification also
apply at the macroeconomic level. Besides
making a more efficient allocation of capital
possible, international risk diversification can
dampen temporary fluctuations in individual
countries’ GDP owing to their integration
into the global economy and limit their im-
pact on national consumption potential.1On
the other hand, however, the closer interde-
pendency is also likely to result in shocks
being transmitted more quickly, with the pos-
sibility of negative wealth effects and adjust-
ment burdens for the real economy.
The growing together of the world economy
is clearly reflected in the pronounced increase
in cross-border assets. At the end of 2007
(data on the external asset position for 2008
are not yet available for all countries), total
cross-border assets and liabilities documented
worldwide amounted to some US$192 trillion
(or3131 trillion). Of that figure, almost
US$77 trillion ( 352 trillion) was accounted for
by the euro-area countries (including assets
and liabilities among the euro-area countries
themselves). Compared with 1999, global
holdings of cross-border assets and liabilities
are today almost four times higher as a result.The financial integration of the euro-area
countries into the global financial markets
has largely kept pace with this rate of expan-
sion in recent years. For instance, the euro-
area countries’ share of external asset pos-
itions worldwide between 2002 and 2007 re-
mained very steady at around 40%. The fi-
nancial links of the single currency area as a
whole with the rest of the world – ie at the
external borders of the euro area, excluding
intra-EMU asset positions – have likewise
grown appreciably since the euro was intro-
duced. In 2008, as measured by holdings,
they amounted to almost 330 trillion. This is
roughly two and a half times the figure for
1999.
Even stronger than the increase in financial
links with non-euro-area countries since 1999
has been – in terms of external assets data –
the growth of financial links between euro-
area countries themselves.2This is supported
by a comparison of direct and portfolio in-
vestment holdings, broken down by region,
for a number of EMU countries3– Finland,
France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Por-
1This type of hedging against risk is often referred to in
the literature as risk sharing. It differs from risk sharing in
a community of insurees which, in the event of loss, pro-
vides for real income transfers without a direct consider-
ation. Hedging against risk by diversifying assets inter-
nationally, on the other hand, is based on lower fluctu-
ations in investment income. A further means of inter-
national consumption smoothing lies in the variation of
external saving with corresponding adjustments to the
current account balance.
2Data on the international investment position provide
information on a very highly aggregated level. The signifi-
cance of the intra-EMU focus may vary not only between
the individual countries but also depending on segment
and industry, and can be modelled using additional indi-
cators. See European Central Bank, Financial Integration
in Europe, April 2009.

35tugal and Spain. In almost all cases, intra-
EMU assets in the categories mentioned haveincreased more strongly than the correspond-ing external positions overall. The same ap-plies to liabilities in direct investment (see ad-jacent chart).
The driving forces behind global financial in-
tegration have been and remain technologic-al progress – particularly in information andcommunication technology – and the open-ing up of national financial markets to foreigninvestors. Besides giving banks a global orien-tation, these factors led to the growing im-portance of multinational enterprises and theheightened presence of institutional invest-ors. The latter traditionally engage morestrongly in cross-border investment activitiesthan do private investors and they have con-tinued to increase their foreign investment inrecent years. The single currency and the har-monisation of the institutional framework inthe euro area have given additional impetusto financial market integration among theparticipating countries. Monetary unionmade it possible to diversify investment andborrowing without the need to incur add-itional currency risks. What is more, the singlecurrency had the effect of increasing the li-quidity of key financial market segments.
In view of these benefits which the single cur-
rency area offers, investors’ focus may rea-sonably be expected to be more intra-European than on countries outside the euroarea. From the risk diversification point ofview, however, it should be borne in mindthat the euro area could perhaps also bemore exposed to unidirectional shocks. More-over, the exchange rate can also be a way for
investors to diversify risk. Thus, the elimin-ation of the intra-European exchange raterisk has also contributed to investment inother currencies and investments outside theeuro area.Capital investments of

36Capital links within the euro area
from the German perspective
The increase in intra-European capital invest-
ment has, however, been a long-term process
witnessed not only since the introduction of
the euro. Germany may serve as an example
in studying these developments. In the 1970s
and 1980s, the share of German capital ex-
ports to the other countries of the present-
day euro area relative to total foreign invest-
ment averaged 26% and 29% respectively. In
the 1990s up to the beginning of monetary
union, the share averaged 45%, and 51% in
the period from 1999 to 2008. In Germany’s
international investment position this was re-
flected in a rise in the percentage of assets in-
vested in other euro-area countries from 39%in mid-1999 to 52% at the end of 2008 (see
adjacent chart).
It may be seen in this context that portfolio
investments are more strongly geared to the
euro area than are other segments of capital
transactions. There was already a shift to-
wards the other partner countries in the early
years following the start of Stage Three of
monetary union, and it has persisted since
then. Since the euro was introduced, inter-
nationally operating German portfolio invest-
ors have invested roughly two out of three
euros in the euro area. This is reflected in
asset holdings. In the case of mutual fund
shares, German investors are almost entirely
focused on the single currency area (2008:
98%). However, this figure is also affected by
the fact that, from a German perspective,
major mutual funds – these are mostly sub-
sidiaries of German banks – are domiciled in
other euro-area countries (Luxembourg and
Ireland). The euro-area countries also account
for a considerable share of foreign bonds
held by German investors (some 68%). Thus,
the EMU share of German foreign investment
in this, the most important securities segment
in terms of market volume, has continued to
rise considerably (by almost 20 percentage
points) since the euro was introduced. And
even in the months before the launch of the
euro, German investors – expecting to make
capital gains from the interest rate conver-
gence of the then “high-interest countries”
(convergence trading) – invested heavily in
issues of other (at that time, potential) euro-
area countries.4In the case of equities, byGermany’s international

37contrast, German investors have not dis-
played any such markedly stronger focus on
other euro-area issuers in recent years. At the
end of 2008, the corresponding percentage
was some 43%, ie only a little higher than in
mid-1999 (40%). Especially when investing in
public limited companies, which often oper-
ate worldwide, investors attach great import-
ance to aspects such as regional origin (cur-
rency denomination) and the sector to which
a company belongs. They influence the risk/
return profile of an equity investment and,
therefore, on possible diversification effects.
Moreover, it may be noted that stock market
capitalisation is especially prevalent in major
economies outside the euro area (United
States, United Kingdom), whereas the differ-
ential in the case of bonds outstanding is less
pronounced.
German borrowers, too, attach greater im-
portance to the euro area for raising funds
abroad than they did in the early days of
monetary union. This is most striking in the
case of bonds. At the end of 2008, 66% of
foreign-owned paper was held by investors
from other euro-area partner countries –
35 percentage points more than in mid-1999.
Holders of German equities who are based in
other euro-area countries have increased
their positions less noticeably, however, their
share having risen from 26% in mid-1999 to
37% in 2008.5
Many direct investments had already been
made in other EU countries (and, to an ex-
tent, in potential euro-area countries) during
the two decades preceding monetary union.
Nevertheless, the cross-border ties betweenenterprises within Europe were strengthened
further after 1999 as well. Thus, the share of
equity capital invested in the euro area by
German investors had risen to 46% by the
end of 2008; this was roughly 10 percentage
points above the mid-1999 figure. Converse-
ly, there were similar developments in the in-
crease in equity capital deployed in Germany
by enterprises from the rest of the euro area
(2008: 60% of total holdings compared with
51% at mid-1999).6
Home bias as an indicator

5The first purchaser and the holder of securities are not
identical if the original purchaser – often a bank – sells
the security on. If the purchaser and the holder are domi-
ciled in different countries, the regional breakdown of
the securities liabilities can no longer be reliably ascer-
tained on the basis of the balance of payment transaction
data, which supply important information when compil-
ing the international investment position. For the years
from 2001 onwards, it is possible in most cases to deter-
mine the domicile of the actual holder on the basis of the
regional breakdown of German securities liabilities con-
tained in the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Sur-
vey (CPIS), in which the Bundesbank also participates.
See Deutsche Bundesbank, Regional breakdown of Ger-
man securities liabilities according to the Coordinated
Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS), Monthly Report, Octo-
ber 2008, pp 26-27.
6The regional classification of investments may be dis-
torted where foreign direct investments in Germany are
made through group companies domiciled in a third
country acting as intermediaries. For example, if a subsid-
iary of a US parent company is domiciled in the euro area
and holds a stake in an enterprise in Germany, the stake
is shown in the international investment position as a dir-
ect investment from the euro area. The Bundesbank’s dir-
ect investment statistics reveal that, at the end of 2007,
roughly 40% of foreign direct investment stocks in Ger-
many attributed to investors from other euro-area coun-
tries were held by investors whose parent company was
domiciled outside the euro area. Roughly half of such dir-
ect investment and 22% of primary direct investment in
Germany from the euro area was attributed to the Neth-
erlands, with holding companies playing an important
part in this context.Rise in equity

38gration is the investor’s tendency to give pref-
erence to domestic securities, ie home bias.
Provided all investors have perfect informa-
tion and given the absence of transaction
costs, the international dispersion of secur-
ities ought to be identical in the portfolios of
all countries and so correspond to the region-
al structure of securities outstanding world-
wide.7The home bias indicates the extent to
which foreign securities held by domestic in-
vestors are underrepresented in terms of their
weight in the global portfolio. The home bias
indicator normally assumes values of be-
tween 0% (the composition of the domestic
portfolio matches that of the global portfolio)
and 100% (only domestic securities are
held).8
Besides securities, the home bias concept
can, in principle, also be applied to other
international investment positions such as dir-
ect investments or loans. At the end of 2008,
portfolio investment accounted for no more
than about 30% of German external assets.
Direct investment accounted for 18%, and
half of external assets took the form of loans
and other assets. Statistical problems arise
when calculating the home bias towards
these assets, however, because the respective
reference variables – the (book) value of all
enterprises worldwide and the volume of
credit outstanding worldwide – are not avail-
able. For this reason, the home bias towards
securities, which is relatively easy to deter-
mine, is often used as an indicator of a given
country’s general financial integration into
the world economy. It is a straightforward
and useful procedure to differentiate accord-ing to equities and mutual fund shares on the
one hand and debt securities on the other.
On an unweighted average of 10 euro-area
countries,9the home bias towards equities
(including mutual fund shares) slipped from
84% to 81% between 1991 and 1998, falling
heavily after the euro was introduced to
stand at 59% at the end of 2007. The bias to-
wards domestic debt securities also de-
creased. Whereas the home bias came to
91% at end-1991, it was only 78% on the
eve of the introduction of the euro and 58%
at end-2007. Developments for Germany are
largely in keeping with those for the other
countries observed. From figures well in ex-
cess of 80% in the early 1990s, by the end of
2007 the home bias was down to 55% for
equities and mutual fund shares and 57% for
debt securities. With that, German home bias
figures occupied a mid-table position in the
group of countries as at the two reference
dates.10
7See B Solnik (1974), An Equilibrium Model of the Inter-
national Capital Markets, Journal of Economic Theory,
Vol 8, pp 500-524. The Capital Asset Pricing Model
(CAPM) is based on the assumption that all investors
have perfect information and that there are no transac-
tion costs. Generally speaking, the assessments can also
be applied to other assets classes, although in this case
deviations from the key assumptions are even greater in
reality than they are in the securities markets.
8In special cases in which foreign securities are “overre-
presented”, the home bias may also take on negative val-
ues. For details on the exact calculation, see the box on
p 40, footnote 5.

ingful data exist for the past for countries which joined
the euro area after the introduction of the euro.
10In Germany, the decrease in the home bias towards
equities and mutual fund shares since the turn of the mil-
lennium has largely been due to the growing importance
of investment funds domiciled abroad (see pp 36f). The
decline would have been considerably less pronounced

39However, the convergence of the regional
structure with the reference standard since
the beginning of Stage Three of monetary
union is by no means due exclusively to
stronger diversification within the euro area.
Taking the euro area as a whole, the propen-
sity to hold foreign securities likewise rose no-
ticeably between 1999 and 2007. This is true
of equities and investment funds, for which
the home bias slid from 76% to 49%, and of
debt securities, which saw the home bias
drop from 81% to 74%. This development is
further evidence that, on the whole, Euro-
pean integration has fostered international
ties among the participating countries and
was not the result of, say, a withdrawal from
the global capital markets.Risk sharing in the European monetary
union
With regard to European monetary union,
the question arises as to whether the above-
mentioned strengthening of financial ties has
also been reflected in real economic conver-
gence and whether, besides promoting the
convergence of economic development, it
has contributed to the smoothing of national
consumption paths.
In most countries, one economic policy ob-
jective lies in balancing countervailing eco-
nomic developments within the national terri-
tory. Key instruments in achieving this object-
ive are transfer payments between govern-
ment authorities and automatic stabilisation
through centralised taxes and social benefits.Home bias *

40Deutsche BundesbankInternational consumption smoothing in the euro area
The term “international risk sharing” denotes the possi-
bility of absorbing temporary fluctuations in individual
countries’ GDP through financial integration into the
global economy and of limiting their impact on nation-
al consumption paths. A distinction should be drawn
between this evening-out of short to medium-term
fluctuations and the longer-term differences among
national growth rates for value added and consump-
tion, which can lead to structural current account
deficits in countries in the midst of an economic catch-
up process. In the following empirical analysis, such
trends were eliminated using the Hodrick-Prescott
method.1
The extent of international consumption smoothing
within the euro area can be measured using the elasti-
city of the residual cyclical development of national
consumption compared with the euro-area average
ðCi;t/C0/C0CtÞ) to the cyclical development of GDP relative
to the euro-area average ðGDP i;t/C0/C0GDP tÞ.2
The estimates are based on the period from 1991 to
2007 and encompass ten euro-area countries.3Statistic-
ally significant consumption smoothing exists if, in the
regression equation
Ci;t/C0/C0Ct¼/C110þð1/C0/C111ÞðGDP i;t/C0/C0GDP tÞþ/C15i;t,(1),
the coefficient /C111is significantly positive.4
Parameter /C111is indeed highly significant and shows
that, on an average of the observation period, only
around 60% of national fluctuations in value added
were reflected in consumption changes relative to the
development of consumption in the group of countries
as a whole. Admittedly, this does not constitute evi-
dence of an evening-out of income risks across coun-tries. National mechanisms stemming from countercy-
clical economic policy, such as the effect of automatic
stabilisers in the area of fiscal policy, and individual be-
havioural changes also stabilise consumption through
adjustment of the aggregate saving ratio.
The second step is therefore to establish whether finan-
cial integration in Europe had a positive impact on con-
sumption smoothing among euro-area countries. First,
the introduction of the single currency in 1999 is taken
as an indicator; the dummy variable EMU is 0 for the
years from 1991 to 1998 and 1 for the subsequent years.
In the modified regression equation
Ci;t/C0/C0Ct¼/C110þð1/C0/C111/C0/C112/C1EMU tÞ (2)
ðGDP i;t/C0/C0GDP tÞþ"i;t,
a significantly positive value for /C112signals that con-
sumption smoothing within the euro area has increased
since 1998. The results in the second column of the
table support this hypothesis. However, the simplicity
of the dummy variables means that no conclusions can
be drawn regarding the underlying mechanism of risk
sharing. In addition, some important elements of finan-
cial integration in Europe were not first implemented
when Stage 3 of European monetary union was formal-
ly initiated but were introduced as part of an ongoing
process in the preceding and subsequent years.
For this reason, the EMU dummy was replaced with two
key indicators of international financial integration.
They denote the convergence of the national securities
portfolio with the composition of the global portfolio.
They deviate from the ideal value, 100% (complete cor-
respondence), by the amount of the home bias for
equities and mutual fund shares ( HBE) and for debt se-
curities ( HBD ).5As non-European assets are also import-

41ant for risk diversification, equal account is taken of
European and non-European foreign securities.6This is
borne out by the fact that financial integration with
non-euro-area countries has likewise risen in the course
of European integration and should therefore be in-
cluded in the analysis.7In the regression equation

a significant positive value for /C113or/C114suggests that
the international diversification of the securities port-
folio helps to smooth the consumption path in the indi-
vidual countries.
It is shown that the home bias in the countries analysed
does indeed have a significant impact on risk sharing
within the euro area and that taking account of the
home bias increases the explanatory power of the re-gression compared with the estimation using a dummy
variable (column 3 of the table). However, a higher
share of foreign securities in the national portfolios
does not produce a stabilising effect in all categories of
investment. As expected, a broader regional distribu-
tion of equity ownership seems to go hand in hand
with a smoothing of investment income and the con-
sumption path. By contrast, no statistically significant
correlation can be found between the regional diversi-
fication of debt securities and the effects of fluctu-
ations in national value added on consumption.
This result can be taken to imply that an evening-out of
national income cycles across countries tends to occur
to a greater extent among investment vehicles such as
equities, for which returns are more cyclically sensitive.
By contrast, for debt securities, which often have a
fixed interest rate and, in Europe, are still dominated
by government bonds (which are considered largely
safe), the regional diversification of income volatility
does not play a key role.
The results are consistent with other empirical analyses.
For example, in Demyanyk et al and Sørensen et al , the
results for the impact of equity capital diversification
and credit diversification on international risk sharing
also differed.8Although both studies found a positive
correlation between the regional distribution of equity
capital and consumption smoothing, the results for
debt securities or loans were negative or insignificant.
The cause is thought to be an insufficient number of
observations (in the case of insignificant results) or an
improvement in access to credit with increasing income
growth and consumption growth (Demyanyk et al ,
2008).
in the portfolios of domestic investors in relation to their share in the
global portfolio. The formula for calculating the home bias is as fol-lows: home bias = 100% – (percentage share of foreign securities inthe portfolio of domestic investors / percentage share of foreign se-curities in the global portfolio). A home bias of 100% means that theinvestors own only domestic securities; a value of 0% means thatthere is the same share of foreign securities in the national portfolioas in the global portfolio. — 6The greater the convergence betweenbusiness cycles within the euro area, the less suitable European for-
eign securities become for diversifying income risk. — 7See p 39. —

42There are no corresponding instruments at
the European level. The redistribution instru-
ments that do exist, such as the Structural
Funds or the Cohesion Fund, aim to achieve
long-term objectives of real economic conver-
gence, but are not suitable as a means of off-
setting temporary country-specific income
fluctuations. This is why private-sector chan-
nels of income stabilisation play a special role.
Diverging income and consumption paths
may create conflicts of interest between
member countries which are in different
phases of the business cycle. The impact of
stabilisation mechanisms on country-specific
income fluctuations is therefore of great sig-
nificance not least in terms of the single mon-
etary policy within the euro area, which can
only take its bearings from aggregated vari-
ables of the euro area as a whole.
In the ideal case of a perfect international
sharing of risk, the cyclical differentials in the
growth of consumer demand between the in-
dividual countries would be wholly independ-
ent of temporary growth differentials in value
added.11Although this is not the case in the
euro area, an econometric study can show
that a high degree of consumption smooth-
ing takes place in the euro-area countries (see
the box on pages 40-41). Only some 60% of
short-term changes in national value added
appear to be reflected in consumption level
adjustments in relation to the corresponding
European average.
In principle, also in the national context there
is a tendency among consumers to smooth
their consumption profiles over time. This
may be achieved without government influ-ence through a variation in private saving.
Government institutions, too – such as the
social security systems – absorb part of the in-
come fluctuations that arise. However, there
are clear indications that consumption paths
have converged more quickly than economic
cycles, in particular since the introduction of
the euro. This would indicate that, besides
national factors, financial market integration
is also likely to have made a major contribu-
tion. This is not only a matter of the direct
capital flows between the euro-area mem-
bers. Although the pronounced financial inte-
gration among euro-area countries indicates
that bilateral payment flows play an import-
ant role, the integration of the single currency
area as a whole into the global economy has
had a similar effect.
The hypothesis that greater financial integra-
tion among the euro-area countries and with
third countries plays a significant role can be
verified empirically. Of particular importance
in this context is the concept of home bias ex-
plained above. It is assumed that as the home
bias declines, income from securities develops
more uniformly, at least within one currency
area, and is less dependent on special national
factors. The steadying of this income com-
ponent, in turn, ought to be reflected in a
stabilisation of consumer demand. Indeed,
evidence exists of the above-mentioned di-
versification effect in the case of holdings of
foreign equities. By contrast, there is no stat-
istically significant correlation between the re-

sumption smoothing within the euro area.
This finding may be taken to indicate that
fluctuations in yields achievable on equity
holdings can be reduced by including more
international assets in the portfolio. With re-
gard to debt securities, on the other hand,
fixed-rate government bonds – which, more-
over, display a low risk of default even in
times of crisis – predominate. It therefore fol-
lows that international portfolio diversifica-
tion aimed at smoothing investment income
is largely ineffective for this asset class; nor is
it necessary. What is more, in the run-up to
monetary union, yield differentials between
euro-area government bonds largely reflected
differences in inflation and exchange rate ex-
pectations, and have converged substantially
since the introduction of the euro.12
Financial market crisis highlights rising
interdependence
Theory and empirical evidence show that fi-
nancial integration brings considerable bene-
fits. Besides possibilities of consumption
smoothing, easy access to international cap-
ital markets improves, in principle, the alloca-
tion of resources as it allows investors to in-
vest their capital where potential returns are
highest – depending, of course, on their risk
appetite. Moreover, the bigger global capital
market offers (potential) borrowers additional
sources of funding. Yet it can also be as-
sumed that the transmission channels of
shocks will change as international financial
links become closer. Whereas the significanceof domestic developments will tend to de-
crease, macroeconomic or financial changes
abroad will gain in importance. In this re-
spect, the composition of external assets may
point to a possible vulnerability. The geo-
graphical breakdown and the currency struc-
ture are relevant in that they give an idea of
the regions and currencies in relation to
which a national economy might be particu-
larly vulnerable to shocks.
In the case of Germany, for example, cross-
border capital links are concentrated on the
industrial countries. In 2008, this group of
countries accounted for roughly 90% of all
external assets and liabilities. Given that these
countries were hard hit by the current finan-
cial crisis, repercussions for German external
assets were inevitable. Moreover, the banking
sector (excluding the Bundesbank), as credit-
or and debtor for the international capital
links, is a major player in this field. Monetary
financial institutions (MFIs) were involved in
about 49% of assets and 46% of liabilities in
2008. At the same time, however, direct ex-
posure to exchange rate changes is limited,
given the fact that only a comparatively small
percentage of external assets and liabilities is
denominated in a foreign currency (almost
70% of assets and just over 80% of liabilities
at the end of 2008 were denominated in
euro). It should also be borne in mind that
Germany is a net creditor vis-/C224-vis the rest of
the world, and that at end-2008 German net
foreign assets came to 3668 billion (some
27% of GDP).

44In addition to the influence of such structural
patterns, it is to be expected that market
players will react to this severe shock to confi-
dence and that their reactions will entail ad-
justments to their external positions. It can
generally be assumed that the crisis will make
investors more cautious in their cross-border
activities and that they will avoid especially
risky financial instruments. They may also
have changed their regional investment
focus.
Indeed, recent developments in German ex-
ternal assets are evidence both of changes in
market prices as a direct consequence of the
crisis and of portfolio adjustments by inter-
nationally operating investors. At end-2008,
the German international investment position
showed foreign assets to be down on the
year by nearly 1% (almost 338 billion) for the
first time since 2002. On the liabilities side,
meanwhile, there was a year-over-year de-
crease of 11/C252%(372 billion) for the first time
in over 20 years. Apart from the sale of equi-
ties, severe stock price losses, in particular,
put downward pressure on asset-side and
liability-side positions, whereas changes in ex-
change rates played only a secondary role.
The MSCI index, which reflects price develop-
ments on international equity markets,
plunged by 40% in the course of 2008, and
the German CDAX by 44%, whilst changes
in foreign exchange rates remained limited,
with the euro appreciating by 21/C252% on aver-
age against the currencies of 21 trading part-
ners. On balance, the equity position across
all sectors fell by 3167 billion (53%) on the
asset side and 3276 billion (49%) on the li-
ability side compared with the end of 2007.By contrast, the global flight by investors to
safe and liquid financial instruments follow-
ing the collapse of Lehman Brothers drove up
the volume of German government bonds
held by non-residents by some 3100 billion
between end-2007 and end-2008. This
slowed down the decline in German external
liabilities considerably.
Provisional data available thus far show that
in the first half of 2009, the observed trends
– notably, brisk foreign demand for German
government paper – continued to some ex-
tent, with short-term instruments now in par-
ticular demand (see chart on the opposite
page). German enterprises and households
likewise continued to give preference to for-
eign bonds over equities, although stock
prices staged a significant recovery in the
course of 2009. What is more, domestic MFIs
scaled back their cross-border positions sub-
stantially as part of their general balance
sheet adjustments. Overall, German external
assets have rebounded slightly since the be-
ginning of this year (+1%), whilst external
liabilities have fallen again (-2%).
Crisis-induced adjustments are also reflected
in the regional structure of foreign assets (for
which data are only available up to end-
2008, however). Whereas foreign assets and
liabilities via-/C224-vis other euro-area countries
were up in 2008 (by 31/C252% and slightly more
than1/C252% respectively), there was a pro-
nounced downward correction vis-/C224-vis third
countries (assets by 5% and liabilities by
slightly more than 4%). At first glance, the

45an indication that financial relations within
the single currency area are more stable. Yetthis is contradicted by the fact that, at theend of 2008, portfolio positions severely af-fected by the crisis were also reduced sharplyvis-/C224-vis other euro-area countries. Moreover,a considerable part of the roughly 14% in-crease in unsecuritised lending by MFIs toeuro-area borrowers was due to supportmeasures for foreign branches.
Much as for Germany, the financial crisis has
also left its mark on the euro area’s externalposition vis-/C224-vis the rest of the world. Here,too, the sharp decline in asset prices associ-ated with the financial crisis led to correctionson both the asset and liability sides in 2008.

The fall in the prices of equities issued in theeuro area and held by non-residents washeavier than that of foreign equities and debtinstruments held by euro-area investors. Atthe same time, non-residents upped theirholdings of euro-area government bonds onbalance compared with end-2007. In contrastto Germany, moreover, exchange ratechanges (euro-area assets are largely denom-inated in a foreign currency and liabilities ineuros) had a dampening effect on assets. Insome cases, the valuation-related adjust-ments also continued in the first two quartersof 2009. At mid-2009, euro-area foreignassets were roughly 3

46Conclusion
The increased integration of the capital mar-
kets during the last 20 years has reinforced
the interdependencies of the countries con-
cerned. In the long term, the spreading of in-
come risks has stabilised the development of
consumption paths in the euro-area coun-
tries. Conversely, however, more intense fi-
nancial integration also allows unsound eco-
nomic developments that originate abroad to
spread more easily to other countries via the
“financial channel”. Recent months have
shown how, in an environment of height-
ened uncertainty, changes in risk appetite
and perception can affect cross-border in-
vestment behaviour and lending relation-
ships.The necessary implications must and will be
drawn from the financial crisis in terms of fi-
nancial market regulation and the market
players’ operations. But these should not take
the form of protectionist measures which
may, in turn, involve high and incalculable
economic costs. It is still true that cross-
border investment broadens the spectrum of
possible risk-return combinations for invest-
ors. This, in itself, can have a positive effect
on the real economy, such as smoothing con-
sumption and stabilising flows of income.
One further lesson to be learnt from the re-
cent financial market crisis, finally, is that the
international financial markets need an im-
proved regulatory framework in order to
achieve sound and sustainable business prac-
tices in the financial sector itself.

of ongoing banking
supervisionSupervisory colleges are an important
element of global and European co-
operation between national supervis-
ory authorities. These groups review
the implementation of rules, strat-

isms for an entire banking group. In
their function as a platform for discus-
sion and coordination, they are the
point of initial contact for the consist-
ent application and enforcement of
supervisory regulations and guidelines
throughout the European Union. Be-

approval of advanced risk models in
colleges of supervisors, another goal in
the EU is to achieve a common under-
standing on measures for compliance
with minimum capital requirements at
group level based on a joint risk assess-
ment.
Current initiatives being conducted by
international bodies such as the G20,
the Financial Stability Board and CEBS
are strengthening the role of colleges
of supervisors. This involves a certain
standardisation of operating proced-
ures which – to the extent that this is
based on existing commonalities and
still permits the necessary scope for
flexibility – is to be welcomed. What is
pressing, however, is that the guide-
lines, standards and basic principles
that are to be developed at the global
and European levels be as coherent as
possible without overly restrictive
regulations leading to efficiency losses.

48Development of international
cooperation
The increasing deregulation and liberalisation
beginning in the mid-1980s gave banks round
the world new opportunities for growing
international diversification. In the EU, more-
over, the Single Market and the creation of a
“European Passport” for financial institutions
fostered an increase in international banking
activity as well as mergers and acquisitions
across national borders.
Efforts to harmonise banking supervision
launched with the Basel Committee’s agree-
ments and accords and the subsequently
adopted European rules were initially de-
signed to achieve an internationally coordin-
ated and harmonised minimum level of regu-
lation of banks’ business risks at single-entity
and consolidated level. The introduction of
Basel II meant not only the creation of risk-
sensitive capital requirements in Pillar 1; at
the same time, the Supervisory Review Pro-
cess (Pillar 2) and disclosure requirements
(Pillar 3) extended supervisory activity consid-
erably. Moreover, in many areas the formula-
tion of internationally agreed basic principles
and guidelines makes an important contribu-
tion to the creation of a “level playing field”
for banks and supervisors alike.
The principle of minimum harmonisation of
regulation, however, involves flexibility which
arises from the existence of areas that are not
subject to uniform regulation (such as, up to
now, liquidity regimes) as well as from nation-
al options and discretions within the existing
regulatory framework. Moreover, cross-borderconsolidation creates new fields which re-
quire regulatory coordination wherever a
bank’s core functions fall under a different
national supervisory jurisdiction (through the
transfer of tasks and processes). This aspect is
becoming highly important, especially against
the background of the current discussion on
how supervisors should respond to the finan-
cial crisis. It is the crisis that has clearly shown
just how necessary it is for national super-
visors to exchange such information.
International cooperation among supervisory
authorities has existed for quite some time at
various levels. The ongoing supervision of
large, internationally active banks has been
witnessing an increase in cross-border contact
between supervisors – through, for instance,
international supervisors’ conferences as well
as, just recently, institutionalised “supervisory
colleges”. During the process of Basel II imple-
mentation, these were recommended by the
Accord Implementation Group1of the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision as a plat-
form to encourage the consistent implemen-
tation of Basel II. This underlying concept of
inter-supervisory cooperation was adopted in
Article 131 of the “Banking Directive”2of
2006. The article provides for written coord-
ination and cooperation agreements to gov-
ern the simplified supervision of cross-border
institutions.

49Quite a few new supervisory colleges have
been established recently. This is partly in re-action to the catalogue of recommendationsissued by the Financial Stability Forum (FSF;now the Financial Stability Board (FSB)),
3
which suggested that supervisory colleges beformed for the largest internationally activebanks. The G20 global financial summitin Washington DC in November 2008 tookthis recommendation on board. Moreover, itcalled for a regular exchange of informationbetween the largest banks and their respon-sible colleges on their business activities andrisk situation.
At EU level, too, the member states have
undertaken to recognise the FSF recommen-dations. Although the Banking Directive al-ready contained provisions governing super-visory colleges from the outset, the new Art-icle 131a inserted into the Banking Directivein 2009 now requires supervisory colleges tobe established for all cross-border institutionsby the end of 2010. This requirement toestablish such colleges rests with the homesupervisor of the respective group parentcompany – known as the “consolidatingsupervisor” – and serves to accomplish thetasks listed in Articles 129 and 130 (1) of theBanking Directive: to plan and coordinatesupervisory activities in going concern andemergency situations, to reach a joint deci-sion on the validation of internal models andthe adequacy of own funds on a consolidatedand solo basis
4and to alert other authorities
in an emergency case.
Even though the activities of supervisory col-
leges are primarily designed for ongoingsupervision of going concerns, supervisory
colleges are equally able to play a key sup-porting role in explicit crisis prevention. The“FSF Principles for Cross-Border Cooperationon Crisis Management” require a close linkbetween the existing college structure of thespecific institution and the work on preparingcrisis management in the event of stress.
Supervisory colleges have a supporting role in
crisis management – through the use of theplatform for exchanging, processing and pro-viding information created by these colleges.The Memorandum of Understanding
5adopt-
ed in 2008, moreover, envisaged the estab-lishment of “Cross-Border Stability Groups”(CBSGs) above and beyond the intendedinformation and cooperation requirements.These groups include as members not onlythe supervisory authorities but also thecentral banks and finance ministries of theparticipating countries. The CBSGs can referto specific cross-border banking groups orencompass multiple countries which – forinstance, owing to existing interlinkages –share a common interest in maintaining fi-nancial stability. This shows that these bodiescreate an interwoven network of relation-ships between participating institutions. It ispossible for institutions to be members ofseveral of these groups simultaneously. It istherefore important to make sure that the es-

practice and do not create excessive coordin-
ation requirements. In addition, an overlap
between supervisory colleges and the CBSGs
needs to be avoided. However, a key trait
shared by supervisory colleges and the afore-
mentioned crisis management groups is
that they do not have any decision-making
powers in an emergency. Rather, the import-
ant decisions, the consequences of which are
in some cases severe and could entail major
fiscal implications, are taken by the compe-
tent national authorities.
Overview of existing supervisory colleges
To date, global supervisory colleges have
been established for more than 30 inter-
nationally active groups of banks and finan-
cial services institutions. Within the EU, there
are currently already 36 supervisory colleges6
for cross-border banking groups. Germany is
involved in three global and three EU super-
visory colleges as the consolidating supervisor
and in 12 global and 15 EU colleges as the
host supervisor.
There are fundamentally two different basic
types of supervisory colleges with respect to
their size. “General colleges” represent a sort
of “general meeting”. The supervisors of sub-
sidiaries and any systemically relevant
branches convene, chaired by the consolidat-
ing supervisor. Following on from the revision
to the Banking Directive (CRD II), the role of
supervisors of systemically relevant branches
in the EU was expanded very considerably.
Now the host supervisor takes the ultimatedecision on the relevance of a branch for its
banking system and thus on its membership
in the college. The discussion typically encom-
passes a broad range of issues; the main
areas covered by the general colleges include
developing a common understanding of the
banking group’s strategic orientation and the
associated risk profile and also organisational
concerns.
In accordance with international standards,
the consolidating supervisor also has the op-
tion of creating a supplementary “core col-
lege” with a smaller group of members7so
that specific themes can be discussed in more
detail efficiently. Such theme areas include
quantitative aspects of capital and liquidity
(including stress testing and the planning
thereof) and details concerning supervisory
risk assessment.
There are many other ways to differentiate
such colleges besides the number of partici-
pants. For instance, they may be organised
based on regions or business lines, taking into
account supervisory requirements or require-
ments imposed by the organisation of the
banking groups. The variability of the multior-
ganisational approach ensures a high level of
compliance with these requirements. Impos-
ing a uniform structure, or a set of such struc-
tures, conversely, would pose the threat of in-
formation losses and frictional losses and
therefore quality losses. In the EU, there is a
6The Committee of European Banking Supervisors
(CEBS) had mandated that such institutions be in place
for 36 selected cross-border institutions in the EU – where
this has not already been done – by the end of this year.

51regular exchange of experience on the vari-
ous colleges at CEBS level for quality control
purposes. The amended version of the Bank-
ing Directive,8moreover, gives representatives
of the CEBS secretariat the right to attend
college meetings and gives this committee a
mediating role where necessary.
In order to obtain a better idea of a banking
group, it also makes sense for representatives
of the supervised group to occasionally at-
tend meetings of their responsible college. In
practice, therefore, the procedure is generally
twofold. Having group representatives attend
the general college creates an efficient and
coordinated communication process between
the bank and its supervisors. Their attendance
in the core college opens the door to an in-
depth discussion of specific topics.
How the colleges work
The central guiding motive underlying the or-
ganisation of the working processes in the
supervisory colleges – especially within the
EU – is that decision-making should be as
joint as possible based on avoiding duplica-
tion of work; this is so that supervisors can
better assess group-wide risk. National re-
strictions governing the delegation of tasks,
which are also recognised by CEBS in its rele-
vant guidelines,9represent the limits of this
rationale.
In principle, the consolidating supervisor is re-
sponsible for how the college is organised.
He initiates the supervisory conferences, co-
ordinates the agenda and draws up the pro-gramme of work, which must be updated at
least annually. Moreover, he coordinates the
flow of information, thereby fulfilling the role
of a “central information clearinghouse”. As
regards the distribution of information, there
are typically two recognised criteria for rele-
vance: relevance to the local market and rele-
vance to the group. The consolidating super-
visor is also responsible for the continuous
quality control of the college’s activities,
which may require adjusting the organisa-
tional structure to cope with new situations.
In their practical work, supervisory colleges
use a variety of mutually complementary
communication channels. They centre on ac-
tual physical meetings of supervisors, which
may last up to several days. If required on
short notice, videoconferences or teleconfer-
ences can be held. Secured web-based plat-
forms are increasingly being established by
the consolidating supervisors for the regular
exchange of information.
Key aspects of the colleges’ work
The topics and content of the colleges’ work
are the responsibility of the supervisory au-
thorities involved. The content of the super-
visory discussion and exchange of informa-
tion revolve mainly around information on
major risk areas and results of individual risk
assessments by the supervisory authorities in-

52volved, developments in the markets that are
of relevance to the supervised group, an
introduction to the group’s financial situation,
information on key transactions within the
group (dividends and capital measures),
issues regarding governance, risk manage-
ment and internal controls, the results of
examinations and inspections, reports and
letters by individual authorities on issues of
material relevance, important supervisory de-
cisions that have been either taken or are
pending, and key structural and organisation-
al changes in the group.
Relatively specific rules governing the main
content of the activities of supervisory col-
leges are already contained in Articles 42a,
129, 131, 131a and 132 of the Banking
Directive. In addition, there exist general,
non-binding basic principles – especially the
10 common principles for the functioning
of supervisory colleges10adopted jointly by
CEBS, the Committee of European Insur-
ance and Occupational Pensions Supervisors
(CEIOPS) and the Interim Working Committee
on Financial Conglomerates (IWCFC, now
known as the Joint Committee on Financial
Conglomerates (JCFC)) – and the content of
the written cooperation agreements for each
college.
An additional focal point of cooperation
within the supervisory colleges, alongside the
aforementioned main content, is the plan-
ning and coordination of joint on-site super-
visory examinations.11One key element of
this cooperation is in the validation of internal
models to calculate regulatory capital require-
ments. Article 129 (2) of the Banking Direct-ive requires a joint decision by the supervisory
authorities involved on the application of ad-
vanced measurement approaches for regula-
tory capital requirements. This includes draft-
ing a time schedule for on-site examinations,
conducting the examinations themselves and
– where necessary – follow-up examinations
to monitor compliance with regulatory re-
quirements or to review the rectification of
deficiencies. Depending on the type and the
features of the model, the institution’s organ-
isational structure, its internal control mech-
anisms and the supervisory approach, deci-
sions on the delegation of tasks are taken on
a case-by-case basis while maintaining super-
visory responsibilities. This serves to achieve
not only a common understanding of super-
visory criteria for examining models (method-
ology and documentation, data quality, quan-
titative and qualitative processes, technical
environment) but also agreement on instru-
ments of supervisory examinations and in-
spections. A common decision should be
reached within six months and set down in
writing. If a decision is not reached after six
months, the ultimate decision at group level
rests with the consolidating supervisor.
Another focal point in the off-site supervision
of banking groups is cooperation in the im-
plementation of the Supervisory Review and
Evaluation Process (SREP) of Pillar 2 of Basel II.
At the centre of the SREP is the supervisors’
risk assessment of the affected group of insti-

53tutions – including their view of the banks’ In-
ternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process(ICAAP) to ensure their risk-bearing capacity –as well as supervisory planning. The aim is toensure adequate management and coverageof risks within the risk assessment. In thecollege of supervisors, agreement is to bereached, in particular, on common or com-parable benchmarks for ICAAP informationto ensure consistency and comparability. Forthe purposes of practical activities, the con-solidated supervisor is responsible for, amongother things, planning the time schedule forthe arrival of ICAAP information, monitoringof progress and, as appropriate, initiatingfollow-up work with respect to the bankinggroup.
The amendment to the Banking Directive
introduced a joint decision on the adequacyof regulatory own funds pursuant to Art-icle 129 (3). If the supervisory authorities rep-resented in the college – even after consult-ation with CEBS – fail to achieve such a jointdecision after four months, the decision istaken at group level by the consolidatingsupervisor and at the level of the subsidiariesby their competent supervisors. Alternately,the subsidiaries’ risk assessments and theopinions and reservations of the consolidat-ing supervisor should be taken into account.
National supervisors are fundamentally free
and flexible in how they develop the pro-cesses and formats of these supervisory as-sessments. When creating prudential risk pro-files, German supervisors take special care torecognise qualitative aspects and assess-ments; they by no means reduce the processto a simply quantitative rating procedure. By
specifically weighing and assessing banks’specific situations, this approach ensures thatdue regard is given, wherever possible, to thevariegated aspects of the individual institu-tions. Principles-oriented classification criteriaensure the coherence of assessments using aclassification grid without hampering the pro-cess and mechanistically pre-empting thefindings.
In principle, all instruments for obtaining
prudential information enter into the creationof the risk profile. This comprises findingsfrom supervisors’ examinations and inspec-tions and also from off-site supervision (regu-lar reports, extended disclosure requirements,cross-institutional requests for informationand interviews with members of manage-ment and at working level). The aim andmandate of the consolidating supervisor inthe supervisory colleges is, in the context ofthis exchange of information, to integratethis information – which may come in differ-ent formats – into the supervisory assessmentof the group and to achieve a joint decisionon this information in the college.
There are currently efforts at CEBS level to
promote the development of a commonunderstanding of supervisory risk assessmentin the college of supervisors. However, thenational systems for risk assessment are to beretained.
The jointly developed risk assessment forms
the basis for the joint supervisory planning,which is discussed and agreed in the college.At the centre of supervisory planning is the

54drafting of the normally annual time sched-
ule, which incorporates proposals by the re-
sponsible supervisory authorities. The plan-
ning comprises joint activities or a definition
of the division of tasks for group-level activ-
ities (including the obtaining of information).
The planning of the various home and, as ap-
propriate, host supervisors, which is based on
the respective national assessments, repre-
sents a major input for judging the relevance
at group level and, at the same time, influ-
ences the choice of instruments. The primary
instruments are various types of examinations
and inspections of banking operations (of in-
dividual business lines as well as of models) as
well as off-site supervision instruments (such
as interviews with senior management or re-
quests for information).
Maintaining confidentiality
For practical work in the college, which is
intended to ensure a continuous exchange
of information between national supervisory
authorities within the meaning of a coopera-
tive and functioning network of supervisors,
maintaining confidentiality is a basic precondi-
tion. In the EU, Articles 44 to 52 of the Bank-
ing Directive govern fundamental aspects of
confidentiality with regard to the parties ad-
dressed and to the handling of information. In
addition, these articles also include a liberal-
isation clause for non-EU supervisors: such
supervisors are included in the exchange of in-
formation and, upon invitation by the consoli-
dating supervisor, are entitled to participate in
the college if confidentiality can be ensured at
a level comparable to that of the EU.Formal written coordination and cooperation
agreements between the college members
are an integral part for the establishment of a
relationship based on mutual trust. They set
the framework for cooperation and provide
specific conditions and procedures for the ex-
change of information among supervisory
colleges at various levels, reflecting the size,
structure and complexity of the banking
group. However, they should not be overly
regimented, thereby hampering the effective
flow of information: the defining feature of
colleges of supervisors is precisely their ability
to adapt to the structures and conditions of
the supervised banking group. CEBS has al-
ready prepared a standardised form12for use
in the EU, the details of which can be adapt-
ed to the group’s individual needs. The coord-
ination and cooperation agreements thus
reflect not only the individual features of the
supervised banking groups but also the quite
manifold supervisory approaches applied by
the participating supervisory authorities. To
that extent, there is no “one-size-fits-all” ap-
proach to supervisory colleges: each college is
specific to its supervised institution.13

of establishing colleges of supervisors for all cross-border

end of 2009.
13This is also consistent with the SIG’s vision that super-
visory colleges be flexible bodies that can adapt readily to
the needs of the home supervisor and the group’s organ-
isational structure. CEBS is also thinking in the same
direction. See CEBS, Range of practices on supervisory

55New challenges facing the work of the
colleges of supervisors
One of the lessons from the financial crisis is
that the colleges of supervisors are to be
given a greater role not only in micropruden-
tial supervision but also as an instrument to
improve the link between microprudential
and macroprudential supervision. With this in
mind, the G20, upon the re-inception of the
Financial Stability Board (FSB) in April 2009,
issued a mandate to adopt guidelines for the
establishment and working procedures of
international supervisory colleges.14Now that
the Basel Committee and the FSB have com-
pleted their joint stocktake of the design and
functioning of supervisory colleges, the adop-
tion of a number of principles and “good
practices” for work in the colleges is sched-
uled for the first quarter of 2010.15These
principles are intended to cover structural and
procedural issues and communication prac-
tices and state the role of the colleges in crisis
management.
At the EU level, the amended CRD is intended
to increase the number of colleges of super-
visors and to consolidate and intensify their
practical work through the guidelines cur-
rently under consultation. The inserted Art-
icle 131a(2) of the Banking Directive gave
CEBS a mandate to develop guidelines for the
practical functioning of the colleges of super-
visors. With the college guidelines recently
put forward for public consultations, CEBS
has provided such a general foundation for
the work of the colleges of supervisors for
banks. Its key elements include the exchange
of information, opinions and assessments,the delegation of tasks and activities, the de-
velopment of a joint understanding of the
supervised group’s and group members’ risk
profile, the inclusion of macroprudential risks,
reaching a joint decision on the validation of
internal models for calculating regulatory
capital requirements, the drafting of examin-
ation and inspection schedules based on the
risk assessment, the coordination of pruden-
tial activities under Pillar 2 and the coordin-
ation of measures in an emergency case. The
preparatory work was also accompanied by
an inventory taken as part of a peer-review
analysis of individual colleges of supervisors.
In the context of a new “comply or explain”
procedure introduced against the back-
ground of the planned convergence of super-
visory instruments and procedures in the EU,
CEBS can put pressure on national supervisors
to implement the framework. This could con-
sequently increase the need to eliminate any
inefficiencies in working procedures by dele-
gating tasks and responsibilities within the
supervisory colleges. What is important here
is that – in line with the underlying principles
essential to understanding what colleges of
supervisors are about – such voluntary dele-
gations of tasks always be conducted in the
light of the needs and the situation of the
supervised banking groups.
In the light of the desire for a standardisation
of sorts, these initiatives are to be welcomed.
Such guidelines can be meaningful, especially
14See London Summit – Leaders’ Statement. Declar-
ation on strengthening the financial system – London
Summit, 2 April 2009.
15Although such guidelines are not legally binding, their
rules governing the function and content of supervisory
colleges still have the desired effects.Role of super-

56CEBS guidelines on colleges of supervisors presented for public consultation
At its meeting on 3 December 2009 CEBS
put forward for public consultation a set of
operational guidelines relating to the activ-
ities of supervisory colleges. These guide-
lines provide guidance for the tasks of the
supervisors involved in supervisory colleges.
Chapter 1 provides guidelines to achieve
convergence in the setting-up, formats,
membership and governance of supervisory
colleges, which are to be established under
the auspices of the consolidating super-
visor, or of the home supervisor in case col-
leges are established for entities that oper-
ate in other Member States by means of
significant branches.
Chapter 2 contains guidelines on informa-
tion exchange within the colleges, the
timeliness of information and promotion
of the use of the full suite of available
communication channels. It also provides
guidelines for communication with the
supervised group and defines the participa-
tion of the group in the meetings of the
college.
Chapter 3 focuses on the voluntary sharing
and/or delegation that can take place with-
in a college, except in cases where a joint
decision is prescribed by European legisla-
tion. It is incumbent on colleges of super-
visors to facilitate the voluntary sharing
and delegation of tasks as this mechanism
can increase the effectiveness and effi-
ciency of supervision by optimising super-
visory resources and expertise, avoiding theduplication of tasks and removing burdens
for the supervised institution.
Chapter 4 deals with the cooperative
framework for reaching a joint decision on
the supervisory approval and ongoing re-
view of internal models.
Chapter 5 features guidelines on reaching a
joint decision concerning the adequacy of
own funds held by the group with respect
to its risk profile and the required levels of
own funds to be kept under Pillar 2 at the
consolidated level and at the level of each
entity.
Chapter 6 provides guidance and advice on
how to take into account macroprudential
and sectoral developments within the work
of the college and looks in particular at the
risk assessment of the group and its entities.
Chapter 7 explains how to establish a co-
ordinated supervisory planning framework
for going concern operations which in-
cludes both on-site and off-site supervision,
so as to achieve a consistent group-wide
approach to supervisory work while avoid-
ing duplication of work.
Finally, chapter 8 outlines how to plan
and coordinate supervisory activities when
emergency situations arise in order to
improve communication and cooperation
among supervisors and with other author-
ities (eg central banks and finance minis-
tries) during times of crisis.

57when it comes to assessing existing similar-
ities – such as similar problem areas or sharedexperience and lessons. However, it is advis-able not to adopt excessively strict guidelinesfor supervisory colleges that would createuniformity, as this would pose the threat ofimpairing the efficiency of supervision. Inaddition, it would appear beneficial for theresults of the various initiatives to be as co-herent as possible.
The system of colleges of supervisors, based
on the idea of the consolidating supervisor,is an efficient and unbureaucratic systemwhich serves as the centrepiece of off-sitecross-border supervision of institutions activethroughout the EU. A challenge to this frame-work will be in integrating it into the struc-ture of the compromise to form an EU finan-cial supervisory architecture adopted by ECO-
FIN on 2 December 2009 on the basis of theLarosi/C155re Report.
16In order to maintain the
function of colleges of supervisors as a linch-pin of cooperation in microprudential supervi-sion, the role of the consolidating supervisorshould not be called into question. Within themacroprudential supervision framework andthe interaction with the planned “EuropeanSystemic Risk Board”, colleges of supervisorscan make important contributions to macro-prudential analysis. The information from thesupervisory colleges and thus from the super-vised banking groups, however, is often veryhighly sensitive; its protection must thereforebe especially assured.
