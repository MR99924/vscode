Last year the Bundesbank dedicated its spring
conference to the topic of “Ageing, FinancialMarkets and Monetary Policy”. This confer-ence was the subject of an article in theJune 2001 edition of the Monthly Report. The
conference papers have been published in aone-volume book which is now available atbookshops.
Alan J Auerbach and Heinz Herrmann (eds.):
Ageing, Financial Markets and Monetary Policy
Springer-Verlag, 2002.
Western industrialised countries are facing the pro-
spect of an ageing population. In this book, re-
nowned academics provide an overview of some of
the implications which ageing populations will have
for economic development and financial systems.
The first few chapters discuss the impact of the
ageing process on saving and international capital
flows. That is followed by a discussion of the poten-
tial consequences for financial markets and ultim-
ately for monetary policy. The book takes particular
account of the situation in Europe.

5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Economy as a wholeThe cyclical weakness of the German econ-
omy continued in the fourth quarter of 2001.After adjustment for seasonal and working-day variations, real gross domestic product(GDP) was 0.3% down on the previous quar-ter. In working-day-adjusted terms, there wasno longer a year-on-year increase. On an an-nual average of 2001, growth amounted tono more than 0.6%, compared with 3% in2000. There was thus a perceptible decreasein overall capacity utilisation in the secondhalf of the year, and the number of persons inwork fell significantly.
The main reason for the weak economic per-
formance in the final quarter of 2001 was de-clining spending on investment. With a de-crease of almost one-tenth, expenditure onmachinery and equipment was far below theprevious year’s level in real terms, falling morethan twice as sharply as construction invest-ment. Added to this was the fact that theinternational economic slowdown meant thatexports were no longer able to maintain theirformer level. Households cut back their con-sumption somewhat, although there havebeen various reports of major acquisitionswhen liquidating stockpiled amounts ofDeutsche Mark in connection with the intro-duction of euro banknotes and coins. Surveysalso show, however, that private consumers’readiness to buy has not been great overall.GDP in Q4

6Manufacturing
In seasonally adjusted terms, new manufac-
turing orders in January did not quite matchtheir significantly increased level at the end of2001. The order intake was, however,
12%
above the average of the period from Octo-ber to December. (It is advisable to take thesemonths together in order to offset special ef-fects in the wake of the terrorist attacks inthe United States on 11 September.) Seen inthat light, there are signs that the orders pos-ition is stabilising. Even so, the fact that theJanuary figure, too, was as much as 5
14%
down on the year – almost equally for bothdomestic and export business – does revealhow low the intake of orders still is.Owing to a reorganisation of the statistics,
figures on manufacturing output are currentlyavailable only up to December 2001. At theend of the year, seasonally adjusted outputwas persisting at the already rather low levelof November, and was 5
14% down on one
year before. Taking the information on turn-over that is already available as a yardstick,output is likely to have been stepped up quitesharply in January, however, and to havebeen up on the last two months of autumnlast year. Like new orders, output mighttherefore also have bottomed out.
ConstructionThe construction sector’s order books showed
a perceptible deterioration again in Decemberof last year; expectations of a stabilisation inthe near future were disappointed. In season-ally adjusted terms, the level of incomingorders so clearly undershot the precedingmonths that the fourth quarter as a wholewas down again on the (already very low)average figure for the summer months. Thedecline over 12 months widened to -7
14%.
Industrial customers, especially, were re-
strained in their ordering at the end of theyear, but business in residential constructionalso showed a further decline. Furthermore,there were fewer orders for public sector con-struction, even though the situation in thisarea is still comparatively favourable.
Seasonally adjusted output in December
(more recent statistical data are unavailable atpresent) was somewhat higher than in thepreceding months, although this is likely toReal GDP

7have been due mainly to the comparatively
mild weather conditions that lasted well intothe second half of the month. The figure foroutput was almost one-tenth down on thesame period of 2000.
Labour marketThere was a further deterioration in the situ-
ation on the labour market. At the end of theperiod under review, the decline in employ-ment and the increase in unemploymentwere not as marked as they had been before,however. According to the Federal StatisticalOffice’s estimates, the number of persons inwork fell slightly to a seasonally adjusted38.71 million in December, ie roughly 10,000fewer than in November and just under100,000, or 0.2%, down on the year. How-ever, more and more employed persons hadto put up with cuts in their working hours. InFebruary, 246,000 were registered as beingon short-time work, compared with a figureof 176,000 in December.
At a seasonally adjusted 3.98 million in Febru-
ary, the number of persons registered as un-employed was only slightly higher than in theprevious month. The comparatively mild wea-ther conditions are likely to have had an alle-viating effect, while the sharp onset of winterweather at the turn of the year led to un-employment rising more sharply, especially inthe outdoor occupations. The unemploymentrate remained unchanged at a seasonally ad-justed 9.6%, or 8.1% according to the stand-ard international method of calculation.Economic conditions in Germany*

8Vocational training courses were being at-
tended by 325,000 persons in February, with190,000 persons being employed on job cre-ation schemes. Taking both groups together,this was slightly more than 90,000 below thefigure for last year. Only assistance providedby the Federal Labour Office in addition tothe regulated programmes was being takenup by 10,000 more persons than one year be-fore.
PricesThe annual rate of increase in consumer
prices, which had jumped to 2.1% in January,slowed down significantly in February. Theyear-on-year rate of increase went down to1.7%. One reason for this was the expectedreturn to normal in the prices of seasonalfood products that accompanied the end ofthe cold weather. Mineral oil products wereanother factor. Although they became moreexpensive – in line with price movements onthe international markets – the increase wasmuch less than during the comparable periodof 2001. Much the same applies to house-hold services and motor vehicle maintenanceand repair.
Crude oil prices on the international markets –
measured by the quotations for Brent NorthSea Oil – showed some upward movementduring the last few weeks. Having beensomewhat below US$19 in mid-January, theywere already just under US$21 one monthlater; most recently they were at aroundUS$23
12. This was mainly due to the quite
tight discipline in production applied by OPECmembers and production cutbacks by coun-tries not in OPEC, which coincided with a
gradual cyclical rise in world demand. An-other factor pushing up prices was specula-tion about losses of production in Iraq.
The rise in import prices in January and the
fact that the year-on-year fall narrowed from4.7% at the end of 2001 to 3.4% at the endof the period under review were very largelydue to significant increases in the prices ofagricultural products. By contrast, manufac-tured goods became only moderately moreexpensive. The decline in comparison withearly 2001 is noticeably smaller, however,since there had been significant reductions inprices at the start of last year.
Appendix: Introduction of euro bank-
notes and coins – price developmentsin January 2002
On 1 January 2002, the euro replaced the
Deutsche Mark as a means of cash payment.Although it was possible to go on paying inDeutsche Mark until the end of February inthe retail trade, change was given only ineuro. The selling prices of goods and serviceshad to be converted to euro, at the latest, bythe start of the year. Showing such prices ineuro was compulsory.
A precise recalculation of the widespread
“smooth” or “threshold” prices for food andnon-durable goods using the conversion fac-tor 1.95583 generally gives an “uneven” re-sult. “Smooth prices” are those which end in0 or 5. “Threshold prices” show 8 or 9 in thelast place of the currency subunit. Such pricesLabour market

9are generally regarded as being psychologic-
ally advantageous. However, except in a fewcases, they cannot be arrived at directly whenconverting to euro. For example, when con-verted, DM0.99 becomes 30.51 and DM1.50
becomes 30.77. Adjusting selling prices be-
yond a pure and simple conversion thereforeseems an obvious thing to do. Another factoris that the conversion of prices itself causescosts. In order to minimise such costs, priceadjustments taking account of changes incosts or margins are likely to have been eitherdeferred or brought forward both before andafter the changeover. As a result, pricechanges occurred with exceptional frequencyin January.
The official statistics for January do, in actual
fact, show that there were far more adjust-ments than usual in the prices of productsand services recorded by the price observersand contained in the standard basket ofgoods for households. There was a fairlysharp increase in prices on a broad front. Thiscan be clearly identified by studies using thedatabase of around 700 price series providedby the Federal Statistical Office. These studiescompared the average price movements re-corded in January for the period 1996 to2001 with the changes captured this year. Asthe table on this page shows, several prod-ucts showed an increase in price of up to2
12% compared with December, while price
rises on an average of the preceding six yearshad been significantly lower than
12%.
The large number of price increases for goods
and services recorded in the official statisticsconfirms the impression of many consumersthat, in a lot of cases, upward price move-
ments had occurred along with the change-over to the euro. This is especially true of thewide-ranging services sector. Restaurants andthe hotel and catering trade are frequentlycited as a typical example of this, althoughthe official statistics also reveal sharp pricerises for the services of craft enterprises, forinstance. Moreover, personal-care services –those provided by hairdressers being a primeexample – have become notably more expen-sive. Among manufactured goods, smallerproducts which do not have a very high cost,in particular, showed quite obvious upwardprice adjustments. By contrast, the sellingprices of other manufactured goods, such asconsumer electronics or private motor ve-hicles, were lowered or remained stable inJanuary.Prices of selected goods and services

10It would be inaccurate, however, to infer
from these observations that there was amatching development in consumer prices asa whole. Nor would it be correct to regardthe introduction of euro cash as the maincause of the perceptibly faster rate of in-crease in consumer prices at the start of theyear. Although the prices of goods and ser-vices captured in the consumer price indexrose sharply, at nearly 1% month-on-monthin January 2002, this was very largely due toexceptional and mainly temporary price risesfor seasonal food products and to further taxincreases. The available supply of fresh sea-sonal fruit and vegetables was significantly re-duced as a result of the severe winter wea-ther conditions in late December and earlyJanuary, which also affected the Mediterra-nean countries. This led to exceptional pricerises, which accounted for fully two-fifths ofthe overall increase in consumer prices. Ac-cording to the calculations of the FederalStatistical Office, a similarly large part of theincrease was due to the additional stage ofthe ecological tax and the rise in tobacco andinsurance taxes. The euro changeover was afactor only in the remaining one-fifth of theincrease. What has to be borne in mind inthis context is that the consumer price indexcovers not just households’ daily shopping,but also major purchases which are maderarely or at longer intervals (including, for ex-ample, televisions, cameras and cars), whichshowed only comparatively minor pricemovements in January 2002. The usual an-nual price adjustments in the case of severalpublic services were also significantly lowerthan on average.

11iture with a share of 20% – are likely to have
been converted exactly to euro.
The Bundesbank’s ongoing special analysis of
the frequency distribution of selected individ-ual prices, as reported by the price observersfor various products, indicates that the priceformation process initiated by the eurochangeover is not yet at an end. For someproducts, there are already recognisable con-centrations at new price points. For others,the range of prices is still extremely wide. Forsugar, for example, an attractive price of30.89 was found very often as early as Janu-
ary – as the table on this page shows. Com-pared with the main “threshold price” in De-cember 2001, this represents a price reduc-tion. However, sugar prices had already beenraised during the course of last year, whichmeans that there was still a year-on-year in-crease taking into account the latest price ad-justment. Another identifiable main pricepoint is at 30.92, which corresponds to an
exact conversion from Deutsche Mark toeuro. It remains to be seen whether this “un-even” price is maintained over the long term.The cost of admission to the cinema is one in-stance where there is a much less clearly de-fined set of prices following the introductionof the euro. While clearly “smooth” prices forcinema tickets used to predominate underthe Deutsche Mark, the range of prices hasbecome significantly wider with the euro.Even though an initial main price point hasemerged at 36, higher admission prices are
often encountered, too. On average, there-fore, the cost of going to the cinema went upin January. But the price formation process isunlikely to have finished here either. In add-ition, the analysis confirms the impression
that some Deutsche Mark prices had alreadybeen increased last year before the introduc-tion of euro banknotes and coins so that theycould then be lowered to attractive europrices at the start of 2002.

12ively. The indebtedness of central, state and
local government reached 31,224 billion1at
the end of the year. The rise in indebtednesswas considerably smaller than the large in-crease in the general government budgetdeficit compared with 2000. The main reasonfor this was the repayment of liabilities ofthe Currency Conversion Equalisation Fundin January last year, which was financed bythe UMTS proceeds generated in 2000. Thestructure of government debt shifted furthertowards capital market securities and awayfrom non-marketable instruments. The shareof capital market securities in total indebted-ness rose to 64% at the end of the year,which was around 1 percentage point higherthan at end-2000.In January central, state and local govern-
ment expanded their indebtedness signifi-cantly by 313.1 billion. This was almost solely
due to net borrowing by the Federal Govern-ment which procured 312.9 billion. Of that
amount, three-quarters ( 39.6 billion) were
money market loans. Brisk issuing activitywas recorded in the capital market. Thelaunch of a 10-year Bund issue was fol-
lowed by the reopening of the 30-year issuelaunched in 2000 and the topping-up of thebond placed at the beginning of the month.Gross receipts from bond issues totalled321.8 billion; 310.0 billion of this was allo-
cated to the off-budget special funds. Thevolume of outstanding Bubills declined by
34.3 billion despite a new issue. This was only
a temporary effect, however, and is to beseen in connection with the changeover toissue volumes of 35 billion and a monthly is-
suance frequency (as from April 2002).Owing to net purchases in the context ofmarket regulation operations and high re-demptions, outstanding liabilities arising fromFederal Treasury notes ( Schätze ), five-year
special Federal bonds ( Bobls ) and Federal sav-
ings bonds also declined by 32.9 billion in
total. Borrowings from banks were redeemedby30.5 billion on balance.

13nance the redemption of the Fund’s last out-
standing bond issue amounting to 39.7 bil-
lion was covered by the aforementioned par-ticipation in a Bund issue. The Land Govern-
ments repaid 30.8 billion more than they bor-
rowed in January. While they issued 32.2 bil-
lion (net) of Treasury notes, they repaid bankloans (including cash advances) amounting to32.0 billion. Treasury notes with a maturity
of less than one year issued by the Berlinand Schleswig-Holstein Land Governments
amounting to 31.0 billion altogether were
likewise redeemed. The local authorities seemto have marginally increased their indebted-ness in January.
Federal Government borrowingIn February the Federal Government’s indebt-
edness increased by 32.6 billion. It drew solely
on the capital market on balance, whereas itran down its money market liabilities by 30.9
billion. The Federal Government’s gross bor-rowing principally comprised the follow-upauction of a series 139 Bobl issue with a cou-
pon of 4% which yielded 39.4 billion (total
issue volume including selling in the openmarket and market management stock: 310
billion). Taking into account the redemptionof series 122 from 1997 bearing a 4
12%
interest rate, the Federal Government raised33.2 billion net. The Federal Government ob-
tained smaller amounts from reducing itsmarket management stock for issues ofBunds (31.2 billion) and Schätze (30.3 billion).
The portfolio of loans against borrowers’notes fell again on balance by 31.0 billion.Securities markets
Bond marketThe volume of issues in the domestic bond
market increased markedly in January – asusual in that month. In January, domestic bor-rowers issued bonds to the market value of397.8 billion, compared with 354.5 billion in
December 2001. Despite sizeable redemp-tions and changes in issuers’ holdings of theirown bonds, net sales of domestic bonds werealso quite substantial, at 319.6 billion. For-
eign bonds, by contrast, were sold in the Ger-man market to the extent of only 33.5 billion

exeeded the amount raised by both banksand the public sector. In January, credit insti-tutions received 36.5 billion net from sales of
their own bonds, whereas the outstandingamount of such paper had decreased by 39.4
billion in December. Sales focused on otherbank debt securities, which were launched tothe tune of 36.6 billion net. Debt securities is-
sued by specialised credit institutions andmortgage Pfandbriefe were sold to the extent
of33.4 billion and 31.1 billion (net), respect-
ively. The outstanding amount of publicPfandbriefe , however, declined by 34.6 bil-
lion.In January, the public sector increased its in-
debtedness in the bond market by 36.5 bil-
lion. The Federal Government sold its owndebt securities to the tune of 314.7 billion,
selling, on balance, nothing but long-termpaper. By launching 10-year and 30-yearBund issues, the Federal Government re-
ceived 318.3 billion and 34.8 billion (net), re-
spectively. Two-year Federal Treasury notes(Schätze ) and five-year special Federal bonds
(Bobls ) were sold to the extent of 30.2 billion
and 30.1 billion, respectively; Federal savings
bonds, by contrast, were repurchased to thetune of 31.6 billion (net). The outstanding
amount of Treasury discount paper ( Bubills )
declined by 34.2 billion after the change in
the issue procedure (see page 12).
2Moreover,
bonds of the Federal special funds (“GermanUnity” Fund and Treuhand agency), which nolonger appear as issuers, were redeemed tothe total of 310.1 billion. In January the Land
Governments issued bonds worth 32.1 billion
net.
Domestic non-banks again predominated on
the buyers’ side of the bond market in Janu-ary. They increased their bond portfolios by323.7 billion, almost entirely owing to pur-
chases of domestic paper. German credit in-stitutions enlarged their holdings of bondsand notes by only 30.6 billion. There were
portfolio shifts from domestic bonds (- 31.4
billion), particularly corporate bonds (- 31.1
billion), into foreign paper ( 32.0 billion). Non-Sales and purchases of bonds

Equity marketIn January, domestic enterprises placed new
shares in the German equity market to themarket value of 31.5 billion (December:
31.5 billion). On the buyers’ side, German
credit institutions predominated in January.They purchased shares amounting to 35.9 bil-
lion (net), consisting entirely of domesticpaper ( 37.0 billion). Domestic non-banks, by
contrast, reduced their share portfolios by31.8 billion. They sold domestic paper to the
value of 38.3 billion and purchased foreign
equities to the tune of 36.5 billion (net). Over-
all, residents increased their portfolios of for-eign equities by 36.4 billion, but at the same
time reduced their direct participating inter-ests in domestic enterprises by 31.1 billion. In
January, non-residents invested 32.8 billion in
German equities.
Investment fund certificatesThe amount raised by domestic investment
funds came to 311.5 billion in January. On
balance, 37.1 billion of this amount accrued
to funds open to the general public. Open-end real estate funds received almost 50% ofthese funds ( 33.5 billion), and money-market
funds a further 31.6 billion. Bond-based
funds and share-based funds received 30.8
billion and 30.6 billion, respectively. Mixed
funds and funds of funds were less favouredby investors, with inflows of funds of 30.3 bil-
lion net each. The outstanding amount ofcertificates of pension investment mutual
funds (Altersvorsorgefonds) remained virtual-
ly unchanged. 34.4 billion was invested in
specialised funds. In January, foreign fundcertificates were sold in the German marketto the extent of 33.2 billion. Investment fund
certificates were on balance bought solely byresidents ( 315.4 billion). Non-residents sold
certificates of German investment companiesto the tune of 30.7 billion.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account – the combined
outcome of foreign trade, services, factor in-come and current transfers – ran a surplus of31.3 billion in January 2002, which was al-
most the same as the surplus in December.A larger surplus on trade in goods was ac-companied by a similar rise in the deficit oninvisibles.
According to calculations by the Federal Stat-
istical Office, the surplus on foreign tradeamounted to 310.1 billion; that means that it
exceeded the level in the previous month by31.7 billion. The trade balance likewise im-
proved again in seasonally adjusted terms (in-creasing to 311
12billion in January compared
with just under 311 billion in December
2001). However, this improvement was dueto a sharp fall (of 4%) in imports and only aslight seasonally adjusted fall (of 1
12%) in ex-
ports. The decline in the export of goods(-3%) was also less pronounced than that ofthe import of goods (-5%) in a three-monthcomparison of November 2001 to January2002 with the previous three-month period.Sales and

16The deficit on invisible current transactions
with non-residents amounted to 38.4 billion
in January compared with 36.8 billion in De-
cember. The main reason for the increase waslarger net expenditure on factor income ( 35.5
billion in January compared with 32.6 billion
in December). There was also an increaseddeficit on services in January ( 33.7 billion
against 32.5 billion in December). In the case
of current transfers, however, there was asurplus of 30.7 billion in January following a
deficit of 31.6 billion in December. Payments
to and from the EU budget are subject to par-ticularly sharp fluctuations during the year,and this has an impact on the current trans-fers item.
Net capital exports were again recorded in
portfolio investment in January, but, at 312.4
billion, these were significantly lower than inDecember ( 333.2 billion). At the beginning of
the year German investors acquired foreignpaper worth 313.2 billion compared with
315.0 billion a month earlier. There was
heavy demand for foreign shares ( 36.4 billion)
and investment fund certificates ( 33.2 bil-
lion). In the case of bonds and notes Germaninvestors shifted from foreign currency bondsto euro paper, in the course of which theybought foreign-issued bonds worth 33.1 bil-
lion net. Following a break in December, non-resident investors returned to the Germansecurities markets as net purchasers in Janu-ary, even if only to a very limited extent ( 30.8
billion). Large sales and redemptions ofmoney market paper ( 311.0 billion) which

17certificates again had a negative impact here.
On balance, non-residents purchased Germanbonds and notes worth 39.8 billion and
shares worth 32.7 billion in January.
In contrast to portfolio investment, direct in-
vestment resulted in net capital imports (of35.7 billion) in January. There had also been
net inflows from direct investment in each ofthe previous two months. The result in themonth under review was due to the transac-tions of resident enterprises, which withdrew35.1 billion from their branches abroad. Intra-
group credit flows were the main factor here.Foreign proprietors provided their subsidiariesin Germany with investable funds amountingto30.6 billion.
In the non-securitised credit transactions of
non-banks enterprises and individuals trans-ferred 314.9 billion net abroad. As is usual atthe beginning of the year, they greatly
stocked up their balances with foreign banks.These funds included income which they hadacquired from selling participating interestsand issuing securities and which, to some ex-tent, was being invested only temporarilyabroad. By contrast, the external transactionsof public authorities largely cancelled out(-30.4 billion). 330.5 billion in foreign funds
accrued to German credit institutions in Janu-ary; at the same time, 316.2 billion was ex-
ported through the accounts of the Bundes-bank. These non-securitised capital move-ments of the banking system are essentially areflection of the remaining transactions withnon-residents.

19Circulation of the
Deutsche Mark –from currencyreform to Europeanmonetary unionAmong important dates in Germany’s
modern monetary history are 20 June1948, 1 July 1990 and 1 January 2002.With the currency reform of 20 June1948 the Deutsche Mark became thenew and sole legal tender of West Ger-many. On 1 July 1990 the DeutscheMark’s status as legal tender was ex-tended to the territory of East Ger-many, and 1 January 2002 saw theintroduction of euro banknotes andcoins and therefore the end of theDeutsche Mark’s status as legal tender.At the end of February 2002 DeutscheMark banknotes and coins vanishedcompletely from payments. Over 53years are spanned by these events,years in which the Deutsche Mark be-came an international symbol of stablemoney and economic prosperity. Thepresent article retraces the develop-ment of the circulation of DeutscheMark banknotes and coins and depictshalf a century of German monetary his-tory from the new beginning, theperiod of continuity and then the re-orientation and final metamorphosisinto the euro. Historical experience ofDeutsche Mark currency in circulationprovides a source of knowledge for thepresent and future.

20tatters. Surplus currency abounded.1Banks
were over their heads in debt. The economybecame increasingly paralysed since produc-tion and trading at the fixed Reichsmark priceshad become unattractive. The black marketboomed, and bartering proliferated. The pub-lic increasingly rejected the Reichsmark.
It was urgently necessary to reform the mon-
etary system. In order to eliminate the surplusof money, the Allies chose to reform the cur-rency by replacing the Reichsmark with theDeutsche Mark.
2In preparation for this, a
new central bank system was established inWest Germany in the spring of 1948, consist-ing of independent Land Central Banks andthe Bank deutscher Länder with headquartersin Frankfurt am Main.
3The Deutsche Bundes-
bank became the legal successor of the Bankdeutscher Länder in 1957. In April 1948 theWestern allies convened the Conclave ofRothwesten to involve German experts in theorganisation and technical implementation ofthe currency reform.
Currency reform took effect on Sunday,
20 July 1948. The Issue Act (Emissionsgesetz)transferred to the Bank deutscher Länder thesole right to issue banknotes and, for thetime being, also coins.
4Section 1 of the Cur-
rency Act (Währungsgesetz) stipulated that“the Deutsche Mark currency is valid with ef-fect from 21 June 1948.”
5The act contained
provisions relating to the per capita amount(DM60, to be paid out in two instalments:the first of DM40 and the second of DM20),the business quota of DM60 per employeeand the initial provision for public author-ities.
6Under the Conversion Act of 27 June1948 private non-banks’ credit balances were
converted into Deutsche Mark at the rate of10:1 (including per capita amounts and busi-ness quotas); half of this amount initially re-mained out of reach in a blocked account. Al-though the money stock was relatively smallin terms of the national product, the adjust-ments in the price structure immediately ledto major price increases which were fed by avery high velocity of the money in circulation.
1The volume of currency in circulation in the German
Reich rose during the war alone from RM11 billion to
RM73 billion.
2As early as October 1947 the United States had decided
to award a contract to print new banknotes to the Ameri-
can Bank Note Company. Printing was finished in
March 1948. During 1947 coupons were printed for the
Soviet Occupation Zone; following currency reform in the
western half of the country, these coupons were quickly
stuck on to Reichsmark notes in the Soviet Occupation
Zone.
3Before then France had already introduced the franc as
legal tender in the Saar area. It was not until July 1959,
two years after the Saarland had legally been incorpor-
ated into the Federal Republic of Germany, that the
Deutsche Mark became legal tender in the Saarland.
Meanwhile, in the Soviet Occupation Zone a Deutsche
Emissions- und Girobank had been established on
21 May 1948. Following separate economic reforms in
West Germany and the Soviet Occupation Zone, this
bank was transformed into the Deutsche Notenbank on
20 July 1948 and into the Staatsbank der DDR in 1968.
4The banknotes it issued were denominated in Deutsche
Mark or pfennigs. In addition, the Bank deutscher Länder
was temporarily authorised to issue banknotes not bear-
ing its name (eg those printed in the United States). In
mid-1950 the coinage prerogative reverted to the Federal
Government.
5No coverage or redemption requirements were envis-
aged for the Deutsche Mark, making it a purely paper
currency from the very beginning. On 21 June 1948 the
Reichsmark, the Rentenmark and the Allied military mark
all became invalid.
6The Länder and local authorities received Deutsche
Mark amounts equal to one-sixth of their actual revenues
during the period of October 1947 to March 1948. On
24 June 1948, one day after the announcement of the
Soviet currency reform decree for the Soviet Occupation
Zone and Greater Berlin, the Western powers decreed
the introduction of the Deutsche Mark in West Berlin. On
20 March 1949 the Deutsche Mark became the sole legal
tender in West Berlin. On 24 June 1948 the Soviet Occu-
pation Zone began to issue a new currency which in
July 1948 was named Deutsche Mark der Deutschen
Notenbank . In 1964 it was renamed Mark der Deutschen
Notenbank , becoming Mark der Deutschen Demokra-
tischen Republik in 1968.... preparation

21The military governments therefore decided
at the beginning of October 1948 to cancel70% of the funds in blocked accounts(Blocked Accounts Act of 4 October 1948).Consequently, the conversion ratio forsubstantial Reichsmark balances turned outto be merely 10:0.65. This meant thatthe currency reform had eliminated the mon-etary overhang. Absolutely no claims weregranted over and above those Reichsmark-denominated balances converted intoDeutsche Mark. This meant that the holdersof financial assets, including many small-timesavers, had practically been dispossessed.The worthless claims of banks on the Reichwere also eliminated. As compensation,the banks received claims on the Länder and
later on the Federal Government, therebyeliminating their excessive indebtedness, too.However, recurring liabilities (wages, rents,pensions etc) were converted at the rateof 1:1.
The Reichsmark balances registered by indi-
viduals and enterprises other than banks andpublic institutions amounted to aroundRM145 billion. This was the basis for thesovereign creation of the new money, whichresulted from the per capita amounts andbusiness quotas and from the initial provision-ing of public authorities and the occupyingpowers, and which totalled DM4.4 billion bythe end of June 1948. All in all, the currencychangeover led to the statutory creation ofjust over DM13 billion in 1948.
On the day of the currency reform Ludwig
Erhard – despite the reservations of theAllies – announced that rationing would beconsiderably relaxed and price controls abol-
ished. This instantly reestablished incentivesfor production, sales and earning moneysince money became scarce and thereforevaluable and cherished. The currency andeconomic reform thus became a catalyst fortheWirtschaftswunder, or economic miracle.
In addition, the psychological effect of shopwindows filling up with products overnightwas a decisive factor in the development oftheWirtschaftswunder legend, which soon
more than made up for the fact that thechangeover had resembled expropriation.The Deutsche Mark enjoyed confidence fromthe very first day and was accepted by thepublic as a general medium of payment. Itmaintained this confidence to the very end.Although it did not fully escape currency cri-ses and intermittent risks to its stability, it stillproved to be more stable than all other majorcurrencies, with an average annual inflationrate of 2
34%.
Denominations and pattern of Deutsche
Mark currency in circulation
Over more than five decades the Deutsche
Mark saw little change in the denominationof coins and notes in circulation. There wereno changes at all between 1952 and 1964;later, some higher-value denominations wereintroduced. In 1948 DM5, DM10, DM20,DM50 and DM100 banknotes that wereprinted in the United States were issued. Inaddition, banknotes with a face value of DM2and DM1 and 50 pfennigs were put intocirculation.

22with notes issued by the Bank deutscher Län-
der.7The first few banknotes issued by the
Bank deutscher Länder had a face value of5 pfennigs and 10 pfennigs.
As the technology of the day did not allow new
small-value tokens to be manufactured in timefor currency reform, all Reichsmark notes andcoins up to RM1 continued to be legal tender atone-tenth of their face value in Deutsche Mark,so as to ensure a sufficient supply of smallchange. At the beginning of 1949 new1-pfennig coins, and later new 10-pfennigcoins, were issued. By the end of 1950 coins of2, 5 and 50 pfennigs and DM1 had becomeavailable. The first DM2 coins were issued inMay 1951, and silver DM5 coins in May 1952.
8
These coin denominations were maintained untilthe Deutsche Mark’s final days. The only new-comers were DM10 commemorative coins ofwhich only limited quantities were minted andw h i c hw e r eh a r d l yu s e di np a y m e n t s .A se a r l ya s1953 the Bank deutscher Länder introduced thefirst DM5 commemorative coin.
9O w i n gt ot h e i r
large face values, commemorative coins ac-counted for around 25% of the value of coins incirculation at the end of 2000. Under the Act onthe Minting of Coins of July 1950
10the right to
issue coins, ie the coinage prerogative, restedwith the Federal Government, and the Bundes-bank put coins into circulation on its behalf.However, to prevent seignorage (the differencebetween the face value and the cost of manu-facturing coins, which went to the Federal Gov-ernment) conflicting with the Bundesbank’smonetary policy tasks, the Bundesbank’s approv-al was needed to mint coins if minting exceededDM20 per capita. This amount was already ex-ceeded by the 1950s; at the end of 2000 theamount of coins in circulation amounted to
DM147 per capita.
11
The Issue Act of 1948 limited banknotes incirculation to DM10 billion. This limit wasgradually raised to DM16 billion between1953 and 1956. By that time the currencyhad already demonstrated that it did notneed such confidence-boosting support. TheBundesbank Act of 26 July 1957 removed alllimits to banknotes in circulation;
12in return,
the Bundesbank’s monetary policy powerswere adjusted to make it easier to managethe entire volume of money. The DeutscheMark-denominated banknotes became thesole unrestricted legal tender in Germany andhad to be accepted in all amounts by credit-ors as redemption for monetary debts.
13
7Pursuant to section 3 (4) of the Issue Act, banknotes
not bearing the name “Bank deutscher Länder” would
have had to be recalled not later than 31 December 1952.
However, a November 1952 amendment to the act made
this unnecessary.
8Owing to the sharp rise in the price of silver the
Bundesbank began to withdraw these coins in 1975 and
to replace them with cupro-nickel coins, bringing a
thousand-year-old tradition of silver coins in Germany to
an end. Since then only commemorative coins have con-
tained silver.
9DM5 commemorative coins were issued until 1986,
DM10 coins initially from 1970 to 1972 (to commemor-
ate the Munich Olympics) and then from 1986 to the end
of 2001. Between 0.2 million and 8.85 million coins per
motif were minted. In addition, proof commemorative
coins were minted (with up to 1 million minted per issue).
These coins were worth more than their face value and
were not been included in the coins in circulation. The
same is true of the DM1 gold coin issued by the Bundes-
bank in 2001.
10Superseded by the new Coin Act on 1 January 2002.
11The coinage prerogative continues to lie with the
member states in monetary union (Article 106 (2) of the
EC Treaty). The amount of coins issued in the individual
countries is subject to approval by the ECB.
12Sections 3, 14, 36 and 37 of the Bundesbank Act
form the legal basis for the Bundesbank’s responsibility
for banknotes in circulation.
13Coins, however, were only limited legal tender. Under
the 1950 Coin Act a creditor did not have to accept more
than DM20 in Deutsche Mark coins or more than DM5 in
pfennig coins. Since January 2002 up to 50 euro coins
per payment must be accepted.Issue of coinsBanknotes

23Following its establishment in 1957 the Bun-
desbank initially left the banknotes issued bythe Bank deutscher Länder in circulation. Itwas not until February 1961 that they weregradually replaced by a new series of notes.The last of the banknotes issued by the Bankdeutscher Länder were recalled on 31 July1966. The new series added to existing de-nominations a DM1,000 note in 1964 and aDM500 note in 1965. In a departure from theuniform format of the banknote series of theBank deutscher Länder, the banknotes in thisseries had different sizes for each denomin-ation to avoid confusion and guard againstcounterfeiting. It was not until nearly 30 yearslater that the Bundesbank began to issue anew series of notes between October 1990and October 1992. The reason was primarilyto improve protection against counterfeits, amove necessitated by advances in copyingtechnology. Accordingly, the new notes wereequipped with a number of internationallyaccepted features to protect them againstcounterfeiting, making them among theworld’s best-protected banknotes. In add-ition, account needed to be taken of the in-creasingly computerised nature of cash trans-actions. In 1990 the first-ever DM200 bank-note was introduced. The Bundesbank hopedthat introducing this banknote would lead toa reduction in the number of DM100 bank-notes and thus to a reduction in costs tobanks and the Bundesbank. What actuallytranspired, though, is that demand for theDM200 banknote did not meet expectations.The banknotes from the previous series wererecalled on 30 June 1995.
14The last series of
banknotes to be issued ceased to be legaltender once euro banknotes were introducedat the beginning of 2002. However, all
Deutsche Mark banknotes issued since 1948have retained their value; they have been ex-changed by the Bundesbank indefinitely andfree of charge at their face value or, since thebeginning of 2002, for euro at the irrevocableconversion rate.2000: DM262.1 billion

24The make-up of banknotes in circulation has
changed considerably since the currency re-form. The percentage of smaller denomin-ations up to DM20 has been going downsteadily. Until 1960 the DM50 banknote ac-counted for the largest share of banknotes incirculation, in terms of value, followed by theDM100 banknote. This shift in importancewas based on wage and price increases andthe lengthening of wage payment and wagesettlement periods, until cashless paymentsstarted to proliferate in the mid-sixties. Aslate as the early 1980s the DM100 note ac-counted for half of all banknotes in circula-tion. The importance of the larger denomin-ations, especially the DM1,000 banknote, ini-tially rose quite steadily. However, since thelate 1970s their percentage rose in large in-crements, reaching over 44% by the end of2000. This development reflects several fac-
tors: the general rise in the nominal valueof cash payments, suspected growth of activ-ity in the shadow economy and, most im-portantly, the major role played by large-denomination notes as stores of value. Thepattern of currency in circulation – excludingcommemorative coins – has changed relative-ly little, by contrast.
Longer-term developments and
determinants of currency in circulation
By the time sovereign money creation ended
in 1948, the volume of currency in circulationhad already returned to normal. After that, itgrew almost uninterruptedly in line withnominal GDP growth until the late 1990s.Between 1950 and 2000 the volume ofcurrency in circulation outside the bankingsystem increased by an average of DM7.8 bil-lion annually to DM244.8 billion, or around32-fold. During the same period the nationalproduct – taking into account the enlarge-ment of the territory of the Federal Republicof Germany in 1990 – grew (in nominalterms) around 38-fold. The currency ratio, iethe ratio of currency in circulation to GDP ,therefore declined slightly over the entireperiod. The development of the currencyratio, however, was quite erratic. After virtu-ally stagnating in the 1950s, it went down al-most continually until the early 1970s, reflect-ing, in particular, the increasing spread ofcashless payments. Factors contributing tothis development included the introductionof giro accounts for the general public, cash-less wage and salary payment, innovations in

institutions’ branch networks during thattime frame. Declining currency ratios were atypical feature of most industrial countries atthat time, with this development being morepronounced in some countries than in Ger-many (examples being France, the Nether-lands and the United Kingdom) or, in isolatedcases, occurring much later (Italy). From themid-seventies these factors in Germanywhich were reducing the demand for cash inrelative terms appeared to have expired orsuperseded by other factors. Until the mid-eighties, the currency ratio rose slightly, albeitwith fluctuations, and then rose sharply untilthe late 1990s. Since 1997 the currency ratiohas been back on the decline. Differences inthe opportunity costs of holding cash,changes in the external value of the DeutscheMark and, at times, taxation played a keyrole. Finally, the increase in the circulation ofDeutsche Mark abroad following radical polit-ical change in eastern and south-easternEurope was a considerably important factor.By contrast, the innovations in paymentssince the 1970s have had relatively little im-pact on the demand for cash in Germany.

Money market interest rates and thereforethe opportunity costs of holding cash fluctu-ated violently at times during the 1970s and1980s, leaving a distinct mark on the move-ments of currency. Currency in circulationweakened considerably in the wake of thetight-money policy following the first andsecond oil-price shocks and in 1989 but re-sumed its strong growth during the easy-money periods that followed each monetarytightening. In the 1990s the opportunitycosts of holding cash, by contrast, apparently
only played a minor role in the growth in cur-rency.

15The lack of statistics on Deutsche Mark cash balances
and cash payments in Germany and abroad as well as nu-
merous institutional changes have made it difficult to
make an econometrical analysis of the factors determin-
ing the demand for Deutsche Mark over the entire period
since 1948. A sparingly parameterised specification of
the demand for cash – using a transaction variable and a
short-term interest rate as explanatory variables – is not
capable of satisfactorily mapping structural breaks, deter-
minants having merely a temporary effect and special in-
fluences on the demand for Deutsche Marks in Germany
and abroad. Studies by the Bundesbank also suggest that
the estimated elasticity of income, even when demand
for cash is simply defined, is subject to relatively sharp
fluctuations which are probably attributable to the ex-
planatory variables not taken into account.Opportunity

currency ratio. Against that backgroundDeutsche Mark banknotes became an at-tractive alternative store of value for non-residents, even if the Deutsche Mark was sub-ject to strong exchange-rate expectations. Theaccelerated growth in cash from 1977 to1978, 1985 to 1987 and 1994 to 1995 werelinked to an appreciation of the DeutscheMark, and isolated phases of declining growthsuch as those between 1979 and 1981 or1996 and 1998 were accompanied by a weak-ening of the Deutsche Mark’s external value.
From 1987 to 1993 currency in circulation
was influenced greatly by the debate and de-cisions on taxation. In the period between theannouncement in October 1987 of the with-holding tax on interest income from monet-ary assets and the repeal of this tax in
April 1989 the pace of currency expansionmore than doubled. A period of virtual stag-nation followed before cash growth acceler-ated on the heels of the Federal Constitution-al Court’s decision on the taxation of invest-ment income in June 1991 and reachedunprecedented growth rates by the end of1992, ie immediately prior to the introductionof the Act on the Tax of Interest Income in1993. These developments indicated, for onething, an increase in the hoarding of cashby domestic non-banks at the expense ofinterest-bearing financial assets.
16For an-
other, they indicated that German investorsdeposited monetary capital in cash withbanks in countries where tax laws were morefavourable. It is true that the Deutsche Markbanknotes additionally required for those pur-poses quickly found their way back to theBundesbank since most of this cash flowedinto Germany’s immediate neighbours (Aus-tria, Switzerland and Luxembourg). However,this did temporarily raise the volume of cur-rency in circulation. Cash growth sloweddown after 1986 as the wealth tax was abol-ished with effect from 1997. What is strikingis that the fluctuations in the growth of cashcaused by interest rates, the Deutsche Mark’sexternal value and tax policy primarily influ-enced changes in the demand for DM500and DM1,000 banknotes.

between the Federal Republic of Germanyand the German Democratic Republic Estab-lishing a Monetary, Economic and SocialUnion entered into force, the Deutsche Markbecame the sole legal tender in the GermanDemocratic Republic on 1 July 1990, ie evenbefore political unification, and responsibilityfor monetary and foreign exchange policywas transferred to the Bundesbank. Allassets, in principle, were exchanged at therate of 2:1.
17Although the conversion rate
was rather high compared with the officialrates used in the past, it seemed justifiableparticularly because the inflationary monetaryoverhang in the German Democratic Repub-lic, unlike that of other central and eastEuropean countries, was apparently relativelysmall. Flow variables such as wages and salar-ies were converted at the rate of 1:1.
The entire process of converting East German
marks into Deutsche Mark was carried outthrough the accounts of banks in the Ger-man Democratic Republic; no cash was ex-changed. Cash denominated in marks of theGerman Democratic Republic was to be de-posited in a bank account by 6 July 1990;Deutsche Mark cash was paid out beginningon Sunday, 1 July. While the Bundesbank pro-vided the necessary Deutsche Mark bank-notes from its reserves, the mints were unableto meet all of the demand for coins, whichmeant that pfennig coins of the GermanDemocratic Republic remained legal tenderuntil 1 July 1991.

union did not subsequently exert any particu-lar influence on overall monetary growth.
By the 1970s, if not earlier, the Deutsche
Mark had acquired all the features commonlyassociated with an international currency.This was also reflected by the trend increasein Deutsche Marks held abroad. DeutscheMarks left the country as a result of the in-crease in foreign travel; in addition, foreignworkers who were living in Germany andwhose numbers were steadily rising trans-ferred Deutsche Marks to their home coun-tries. Last but not least, cash also served as across-border capital investment vehicle. Sincesome of the Deutsche Mark banknotes takenabroad either were hoarded or served as a cir-
culating currency, Deutsche Mark balancesabroad apparently continued to grow wellinto the second half of the 1990s. However,the decisive factor was the political and eco-nomic opening of eastern Europe beginningin the late 1980s and the continuing crisis inthe former Yugoslavia, in the course of whichthe domestic currency weakened visibly. Inthose countries the Deutsche Mark acquiredthe status of a substitute currency. This wasdue not only to Germany’s geographical vicin-ity to the former Socialist countries but also,and more importantly, to the massive confi-dence in the stability which the DeutscheMonthly averages, seasonally adjusted, log scale

29Mark had earned in the marketplace of cur-
rencies and which enabled it to obtain wide-spread worldwide acceptance.
There is no way of statistically recording the
amount of Deutsche Mark circulating abroad.Information is available on outflows and re-turn flows of banknotes via German credit in-stitutions, as these data are included in bal-ance-of-payments statistics. However, theseflow variables form just one element of allcross-border banknote transactions and atthe very most can serve as an indicator ofchanges in the Deutsche Mark balances heldabroad.
19As there are no direct methods of
recording Deutsche Mark circulating abroadwhich promise any success, a study by theBundesbank resorted to indirect methods.
20
The study found that at the end of 1994 be-tween 30% and 40% of all Deutsche Markcould have been held abroad. However, for-eign demand for Deutsche Mark probablyslackened noticeably from 1997. Between1997 and mid-2000 overall currency in circu-lation remained more or less stagnant. In1999 it increased temporarily, probablyowing to the turmoil in south-eastern Europe(the Kosovo conflict) and the discussion ofthe year 2000 problem.
21Some east Euro-
pean countries demonstrated impressive ini-tial success in stabilisation. The progress in re-placing government regulations with marketmechanisms inhibited black marketeering,which requires large amounts of cash; thetransition to convertible currencies at realisticexchange rates reduced demand for foreigncurrency; and deposits bore increasingly at-tractive rates of interest. Owing to the stag-nating economy in the former Yugoslavia,there were no signs of further export-related
imports of Deutsche Mark. Net amounts ofbanknotes returning from foreign countriesrose.
In the past few decades, innovations in cash-
less payments have caused cash balances togrow more slowly than consumption or GDPin many countries. Germany’s currency ratio,however, has risen since the 1970s, and thatof the United States since the 1980s. In thosetwo countries cashless payments have beenon the rise with a corresponding decreasein cash balances; foreign demand for theDeutsche Mark and the US dollar, however,has prevented those developments from hav-ing an impact on the currency ratio. In add-ition, the advent of cashless payments in Ger-many has occurred with little fanfare; cashhas continued to be popular as an “inexpen-sive” and effective payment instrument.
22
The credit transfer and direct debit are twotraditional cashless payment instruments inGermany. The next important step followingthe introduction of cashless wage and salary
19In particular, it has been shown that, in addition to do-
mestic currency, Deutsche Mark banknotes have assumed
a role as a medium of payment and store of value in
some countries during times of economic difficulties.
Whenever there have been strong inflationary trends,
real interest rates have been negative and devaluation
has been expected, outflows of banknotes to those states
have increased and return flows decreased.

21However, neither the United Nations’ declaration of
the Deutsche Mark as the official currency of Kosovo in
September 1999 nor the introduction of the Deutsche

30payments in the 1960s was the introduction
of the eurocheque in the early 1970s. Thenumber of cheque cards in Germany rosefrom around 5 million in 1972 to 52 million in2001.
23They were joined by various card-
based payment methods.24Despite their ini-
tially rapid growth, credit cards have re-mained relatively insignificant. Since the early1990s debit cards (eurocheque cards andbank cards with a PIN number) have beenplaying an increasingly important role in cash-less payments. Bank cards seem to be crowd-ing out the credit card and the cheque (ofwhich the guarantee function in conjunctionwith eurocheque cards expired at the begin-ning of 2002) since they represent a relativelycost-effective alternative for both retailersand customers alike. Innovations in paymentsare “cannibalistic” in the sense that theycrowd out not only cash but also alreadyexisting cashless payment instruments. Thismeans that, although card-based paymentshave risen sharply in Germany in the past fewyears, they still make up a relatively small per-centage of cashless payments in Germany(just over 5%) compared to other Europeancountries (the EU average is just under 21%).The spread and use of electronic money onGeldKarten or on chip cards has been ex-
tremely muted. Ultimately, cashless paymentmedia have only a limited ability to duplicatethe special features of cash.
The introduction of euro cash
The growth of cash began to recede in mid-
1997. The average volume of currency in cir-culation in 1998 was smaller than in the pre-vious year for the first time in the Deutsche
Mark’s history. Although there is no one sin-gle cause for this unusual development, theslowdown in demand for Deutsche Markbanknotes in the eastern and south-easternEuropean transition countries and uncertaintyin the run-up to European monetary unionmay have played a role. The receding trendin currency in circulation was interrupted in1999 in connection with the Y2K changeoverbut resumed as the date of the issuance ofeuro cash came closer and closer. Beginningin the second half of 2000 the (seasonally ad-justed) demand for Deutsche Mark steadilydecreased, and this process gained speedfrom the late summer of 2001. In the euroarea as a whole, currency in circulation didnot begin to decline until the spring of 2001.From the late summer currency in circulationwent down in all euro-area countries. Thepace of reduction in cash was much morerapid in Germany than in the euro area as awhole, with the key factor being the particu-larly sharp reduction in large-denominationDeutsche Mark banknotes. Since the secondhalf of 2001 an increasing number ofDeutsche Mark banknotes have been return-ing from abroad, too. At the end of 2001German currency in circulation, at a mereDM162.2 billion ( 382.9 billion), was already
more than 40% lower than its previous year’s
23In 1980 the first automated teller machines were
introduced in Germany. Their proliferation is unlikely to
have had a profound impact on cash balances. Although
the fast and simple access to cash they afford promotes
the use of cash, these machines also make it easier to
hold smaller amounts of cash.

31level. This decline made it easier in terms of
logistics to handle the currency changeover.
Years of comprehensive preparations were
necessary to ensure that the issue of eurocash would go smoothly. The framework setby the European Union and the ECB left it upto each participating country to establish itsown changeover scenario to suit its specificsituation and needs. Production of the newbanknotes and coins began in 1999. Atthe same time, a comprehensive informationcampaign on the introduction of the eurowas launched, covering not just the euro areabut also countries beyond the euro area’s bor-ders, especially those where the DeutscheMark was used as a substitute currency. Theearly return of Deutsche Mark cash was alsopromoted in advertisements with the idea of“decongesting” the changeover process.From September 2001 to the end of theyear German credit institutions were “front-loaded”, ie supplied in advance, with 361 bil-
lion worth of euro cash, which they werethen able to pass on, or “sub-frontload”, totheir counterparties in the euro area and,from December, to those outside the euroarea. Moreover, the Bundesbank provided alittle over 33 billion worth of cash in advance
to non-euro-area central banks and non-euro-area credit institutions active in inter-national foreign currency trading. From17 December “starter kits” of euro coinswere sold to the public, of which the Bundes-bank provided 53.5 million worth a total ofnearly 3550 million.
The introduction of euro cash at the begin-
ning of 2002 marked the completion of theEuropean monetary union project. Deutsche
Mark notes and coins lost their status as legaltender, yet the banking industry, retailers andother cash-handling agents undertook tocontinue accepting Deutsche Mark cash until28 February 2002 to cushion the impact ofthe changeover to euro cash. However, theBundesbank will continue to exchangeDeutsche Mark banknotes and German fed-eral coins for euro indefinitely. The situationwas completely different from the 1948 cur-rency reform or the replacement of the markof the German Democratic Republic. Thistime there was no change in the real value ofthe cash being exchanged. It was only a con-version into euro or exchange of cash at thefixed reference rate which had been in forcefrom the beginning of monetary union in1999. On the whole, the currency change-

accepted by the general public. The DM162.2billion ( 382.9 billion) of cash still in circulation
at the end of 2001 had shrivelled to DM50.4billion ( 325.8 billion) by the end of January
2002, going down even further to DM30.6billion ( 315.7 billion) by the end of February.
At the same time, the amount of euro in cir-culation rose to 380.0 billion. At the end of
February, however, the total amount of bank-notes in circulation in Germany was still 30%below its previous year’s level, and in the euroarea as a whole it was down 19%. It remainsto be seen whether the currency changeoverwill cause the currency ratio to remain per-manently low or whether cash balances willgo back up to near their previous levels.Cash, monetary policy and central bank
profits
The creation of money by credit institutions is
generally associated with an increased needfor central bank money, ie the sum of bank-notes in circulation and minimum reserveswhich are required to be held at the centralbank. Monetary policy therefore depends onthe central bank’s monopoly on the issue ofbanknotes and the creation of central bankmoney. The Bundesbank was at all times ableto set the terms of the money market to suitits objectives – but only as long as commercialbanks needed to refinance themselves at theBundesbank in order to obtain central bankmoney. The banking system did not becomedependent on refinancing until the BrettonWoods system broke down in March 1973.Until the early 1970s it was not the centralbank’s refinancing credit which was thesource of bank liquidity but instead compul-sory purchases of foreign exchange. It wasonly when the obligation to purchase US dol-lars and thus generate liquidity had beenabolished that the Bundesbank took the ini-tiative in creating central bank money. Sincethen the enormous rise in overall refinancingcredit given by the Bundesbank until 1998was largely due to the strong growth in thedemand for cash. The relatively large volumeof Deutsche Mark banknotes in circulationplayed a decisive role in the euro-area com-mercial banking sector’s liquidity deficit vis-à-vis the Eurosystem continuing even after thebeginning of stage three of European monet-ary union in 1999. For the foreseeable future,too, the demand for cash will probably ensurethat the European banking system will be de-

Other preconditions for being able to enforcemonetary policy at all times already exist inthe Eurosystem: for instance, there is no obli-gation to intervene on foreign-exchange mar-kets, nor is the central bank allowed to lendto the public sector.
A central bank’s profit greatly depends on the
volume of banknotes in circulation. Because ithas a monopoly on the issuing of banknotes,the central bank earns a profit from the cre-ation of money. This seigniorage, as it is called,is the difference on the central bank’s balancesheet between interest-bearing assets and thenon-interest-bearing liabilities it incurs in issu-ing banknotes.
25The Bundesbank’ s profits are
based largely on its refinancing credit to thebanking system and its interest-bearing foreignreserve assets. The main items on the liabilitiesside of the balance sheet are expenditure onpersonnel and administration, banknote print-ing, transfers to provisions for pensions andrisks, interest payments on credit institutions’minimum reserve requirements (since 1999)and depreciations. Depreciations on foreign re-serve assets, in particular, absorbed most or allof profits in the years up until 1979. Since1980 the Bundesbank has continuously run aprofit, sometimes a fairly large one, in its an-nual accounts and has transferred this profit tothe Federal Government, which owns theBundesbank. This is a reflection of the stronggrowth and large volume of Deutsche Markbanknotes in circulation, in particular.
Under the ESCB/ECB Statute the monetary in-
come earned by national central banks fromtheir assets, which they hold as balance-sheetcounterparts to banknotes in circulation and
credit institutions’ deposits, is pooled and al-located to individual central banks in accord-ance with their percentage share in the ECB’scapital. The pooling of monetary income isjustified by the fact that such income isdetermined not nationally but by the Euro-system’s single monetary policy. Since euro-denominated central bank money can beused across national borders within the euroarea, there is no longer a link between thecountry of origin and the country of use. Thedemand for euro banknotes in non-euro-areacountries is generally satisfied by the Euro-system, too. The allocation key for seignior-Monthly averages

and is used to approximate the actual de-mand for central bank money in each coun-try. This method of allocation has generallybeen applied from 2002, ie only since theissue of euro banknotes. Monetary incomefor the years 1999 to 2001 from currency incirculation, which in those years was still de-nominated exclusively in national currency,was retained by each respective national cen-tral bank. As the national shares in the overallvolume of banknotes in circulation in theEurosystem differ sharply from the capitalkey, the post-2002 earnings situation of indi-vidual national central banks differs sharply
from the pre-2002 situation. For instance, theBundesbank’s average share of currency incirculation in the Eurosystem was just under37% in the period from 1999 to 2001, yet itspercentage share of the capital key is only30%. As part of a transitional agreement forthe years between 2002 and 2007 a gradualadjustment to the new method of allocatingprofit is therefore being implemented, whichin the medium term will considerably dampenthe impact of the new method on individualcentral banks’ profitability.

35German balance of
payments in 2001The distinct cooling of the global eco-
nomic climate, which has been eman-ating from the United States, re-strained German exports discernibly in2001. Despite the more difficult exter-nal environment, however, German ex-porters fared relatively well. Duringthe same period Germany’s import de-mand declined so sharply that, on bal-ance, the country’s foreign trade madea positive contribution to growth. Theexport surplus reached a record of justover 594 billion, exceeding the previ-
ous year’s level by 535 billion. Ger-
many’s current account was thereforeslightly in surplus for the first timesince the beginning of the 1990s.Following a deficit of 522
12billion in
2000, the surplus in the year under re-view amounted to 52
12billion. The
change in the world economy also leftits mark on the financial transactionswith non-residents. Capital flows inboth directions weakened markedly.The changes in the real and financialtransactions with non-residents willbe addressed in detail below and theunderlying determining factors ex-plained.

36over did not rise much above its level at the
end of 2000. In real terms – that is, after elim-inating price effects – year-on-year exportgrowth, at 5
12%, was relatively strong for the
same reasons. Overall, German exporterstherefore succeeded in defending their pos-ition on foreign markets despite the greaterdifficulties posed by the appreciable deterior-ation in the economic climate and tended toexpand further. At all events, German exportsheld up well given the sharp deceleration inthe growth of the world trade volume, whichin 2001 slowed down to an estimated
12%
compared with the previous year.
This was also true of Germany’s export mar-
kets within the euro area, which account formore than 40% of German exports. Meas-ured in terms of turnover growth, however,stronger stimuli came from trade with part-ners outside the euro area. For example, theexports of goods to the other countries of theeuro area increased by just under 4% lastyear whereas deliveries to the central andeast European countries in transition, whichaccount for approximately 10% of Germanexports, grew by more than 16
12% and
therefore far above the average. Over exten-sive periods last year, however, German ex-porters also had substantial sales successesin the US market. Despite the economicslump in the United States, German exportsof goods there increased by 9%. Exports tothe group of oil exporting countries increasedparticularly strongly. These showed a growthrate of 27%, which was even more dramaticthan in 2000. Much as they had done in pre-vious economic cycles, these countries evi-dently waited for a time before using the in-creased income from higher oil prices to step
up their demand for foreign goods signifi-cantly. By contrast, German trade with Asiadeteriorated considerably in 2001. After ris-ing by almost 30% in the previous year, Ger-man industry’s turnover in the emerging mar-kets of South-East Asia increased by only 2%in 2001. To a large extent this was probably areflection of the harsh adjustment processesin the IT sector, which hit these countriesDM bn  5 bn

37particularly badly. The persistently difficult
macroeconomic developments in Japan actu-ally resulted in a slight fall in sales for Germanexporters in that market (-1%).
The changed demand and sales conditions in
the information and communication tech-nologies sector clearly left their mark on theexport business of German producers. For ex-ample, the exports of goods from this sector,which comprises a wide range of goods, fellby 1
12% compared with the previous year
when there had been a particularly sharpgrowth rate of 30%. However, not all of theproducts attributable to the IT sector wereequally affected by the changed market con-ditions in this sector. Whereas there was a7
12% expansion in the exports of, for ex-
ample, medical and precision instruments,there was a sharp decline in the turnoverof data processing equipment (-10%) andcommunications equipment (-4%), which ac-count for 8% of Germany’s exports of goods.In the previous year these two categories ofgoods had shown extremely large increases insales of 36
12% and 46% respectively. The fall
in the prices of these products explains atbest a small part of the loss in turnover. Ex-ports of chemical and mechanical engineer-ing goods were also much weaker than be-fore. They increased by approximately 3
12%
and just under 4% respectively. By contrast,exports by the car industry were comparative-ly favourable. They rose by 9%. Evidently thedeteriorating economic circumstances hadnot affected demand for German motor ve-hicles on foreign markets so quickly and soseverely.

38might have contributed here to the delayed
effects of the downturn in demand.
The more sluggish economy had a particularly
strong retarding effect on the imports ofgoods in the course of last year. Althoughthere was a slight year-on-year increase in thevalue of imports (+1%), much of this rise wasdue to higher import prices, with the resultthat real imports were at more or less thesame level as in the previous year when theyhad grown by 9% in an environment of dy-namic macroeconomic growth.
Almost all major supplier countries were af-
fected by the weaker German demand forimports. However, imports from the OPECcountries declined particularly sharply (-20%)as oil prices fell at the same time. Large de-clines were also recorded in the imports fromJapan (-16%) and the emerging markets ofSouth-East Asia (-9%), a development whichwas probably due essentially to the slump indemand from the IT sector. The reduction inimports from the United States, by contrast,was relatively moderate at 3
12%. Imports
from the central and east European countriesin transition were a noteworthy exception tothe generally downward trend; here, too, thegrowth rate showed a distinct levelling-off,but, despite that, 9% more goods were im-ported from these countries than in the previ-ous year. This relative stability, which, inciden-tally, was also observed in the case of Germanexports to these countries, is an illustration ofthe close interplay which has now evolved inGermany’s cross-border sales and productiontransactions with the countries in transitionand from which both sides benefit.

39also remarkable is the comparatively moder-
ate weakening in the growth of goods im-ported from the other euro-area countries,with the result that German imports from theeuro area exceeded the previous year’s levelby just over 5
12%. This means that German
foreign trade had a rather stabilising effect onthe rest of the euro area.
The close integration of industrial production
within Europe together with the relativelygood order book situation in the German carindustry might have favoured this develop-ment last year. At all events, that is consistentwith the fact that on the import side, too,the demand for motor vehicles and vehicleparts was relatively brisk (+4%). Althoughthe growth in imports of chemical productswas also remarkably high (+6%), this was es-sentially due to the overhang from the sharpgrowth in turnover in 2000. By contrast, thesignificant fall in demand in the IT sector is re-flected in a substantial decline in the importsof goods in this sector. For example, importsof this category of goods in 2001 were 4%below the previous year’s level. As in the caseof exports, it was particularly the imports ofdata processing equipment (-8%) and com-munications equipment (-4
12%) that were
significantly below their previous year’s levels.Imports of mechanical engineering productsalso declined, falling 2% year on year, prob-ably not least because of the very low invest-ment in Germany.
Owing to the significant fall in imports as a
whole and the distinct easing of prices on thecrude oil markets, on the one hand, and therelatively satisfactory – if likewise weaker –export performance, on the other, Germany
recorded a substantial increase in its exportsurplus in 2001. At 394 billion, it not only ex-
ceeded its previous annual level by 335 billion
but was also far greater than the record sur-pluses recorded towards the end of the1980s. The deficit on invisible current transac-tions with non-residents rose at the sametime but the increase – of 312 billion to 387
billion – was fairly moderate. Part of the largenet income from foreign trade had an impacton the current account, with the result thatthe latter ran a surplus, amounting to 32
12
billion, for the first time since the beginning
of the 1990s. In 2000, by contrast, there hadbeen a deficit of 322
12billion.
For some years now the deficit on services
has been the largest contributor to the overalldeficit on invisibles. In 2001 the services ac-count closed with a deficit of just under 348
billion, which was approximately 33
12billion
more than in 2000. Two-thirds of net expend-iture on services are attributable to foreigntravel, the deficit on which was approximate-ly31 billion more than in 2000. Last year,
however, it was primarily developments in theother categories of services that contributedto the rise in the deficit on the services ac-count. The services combined in the “Otherservices” category have been playing a majorrole here for some years. These comprise abroad range of transactions such as thoseconcerning patents and licences, researchand development, engineering and othertechnical services, including IT services, aswell as assembly work and administration.There was a further deficit on these, this timeof almost 34
12billion to almost 326 billion.Breakdown of

40Moreover, the surplus on cross-border finan-
cial services was halved at just under 312bil-
lion. By contrast, the surpluses on transportservices and on merchanting trade were eachapproximately 31 billion larger at just over
34 billion and 35
12billion respectively. The
balance on insurance services also improvedby a similar amount, resulting in a surplus ofjust under 31 billion on these.
As already mentioned, net expenditure on
cross-border travel rose slightly to just under333 billion. At the same time, the pattern of
German travel expenditure shifted further, ona year-on-year comparison, in favour of Euro-pean destinations at the expense of the long-haul journeys that had been in great demanda few years ago. These changes become evenmore pronounced if they are measured interms of real foreign travel expenditure (ieat constant prices) because the increases inprice related to currency depreciation, espe-cially in the case of many distant destinations,have a negative effect. Incidentally, the great-er degree of general restraint in travelling onholiday and on business is fully consistentwith the scenario in previous periods of cyclic-al weakness when both individuals, owing tothe greater uncertainty about incomes, andenterprises, with the aim of reducing costs,restricted their expenditure on travel. In thesecond half of last year developments werealso likely to have been influenced by theafter-effects of the terrorist attacks on NewYork and Washington.

412000. Germany’s net investment income
payments to foreign investors amounted to311 billion last year, exceeding the previous
year’s outlay by 38
12billion. Part of this was
due to larger payments on direct investmentloans from non-residents. These loans had in-creased significantly in 2000. At the sametime, there was a fall in the earnings ofGerman proprietors from their direct invest-ments.
The current public and private-sector trans-
fers to non-residents declined, by contrast,last year, falling by 3
12billion net to 32612bil-
lion. It was smaller net payments to the EUbudget, in particular, that reduced the deficiton public-sector transfers by 32 billion to
317 billion. By contrast, current private-sector
transfers rose by 31
12billion net to 3912bil-
lion. This was partly due to indemnificationpayments to former forced and slave labour-ers. These indemnification payments, whichare being handled by the Foundation “Re-membrance, Responsibility, Future”, began inMay 2001. A total sum of approximately31 billion was awarded and paid out inter-
nationally last year. This was divided equallybetween the private and public-sector trans-fers in the balance of payments in line withthe equal contribution made by each sector.
A deficit of 31 billion was recorded in the
case of capital transfers. This deficit hastherefore been reduced again to its “usual”size. In 2000 a surplus of almost 37 billion
had arisen in this item mainly as a result ofthe settlement of auctioned UMTS licences,some of which were obtained by foreign tele-communications companies.Financial transactions
Last year’s developments in German financial
transactions reflected the downturn in theworld economy as well as the slowness withwhich the uncertainty of internationally ori-ented investors following the terrorist attacksin the United States began to dissipate. Inview of the sometimes sharp price fluctu-ations on the financial markets and the ratherunfavourable earnings prospects of many en-terprises, these internationally operating in-vestors were decidedly cautious. Consequent-ly, capital flows to and from Germany weak-ened discernibly compared with those of pre-vious years, and the balances of the varioussegments of the financial account movedwithin fairly narrow limits. On aggregate,however, Germany recorded net capital ex-ports amounting to 346 billion in 2001. This
means that the statistically recorded outflowsof funds greatly exceeded the inflows on cur-rent account and those resulting from the re-duction of the foreign reserves. This discrep-ancy indicates that there are serious problemsin recording transactions with non-residentsand makes analysis, particularly of the finan-cial account, more difficult.
One of the problem areas regarding the ac-
curate and complete capture of cross-borderoperations is no doubt portfolio investmentwhere individual instruments and investmentstrategies are becoming increasingly complex,the periods during which securities are heldhave become much shorter and turnover hasrisen rapidly in the past few years. Last yearsaw yet another increase in turnover; owingto the greater risk awareness of financial mar-

42ket participants, however, this rise – of about
17% – was much less pronounced than inprevious years. Investors’ restraint can beseen even more clearly in the gross capitalflows. For example, the amount invested byGerman savers abroad, namely 3128
12bil-
lion, was no more than just over half as muchas they had invested the year before and wasalso much less than in 1998 and 1999. Con-versely, foreign investors acquired more Ger-man securities in terms of value, at 3113 bil-
lion, than they had done in 2000 ( 349 billion).
However, this rise is due solely to the fact thatin 2000 a large corporate acquisition greatlyreduced foreign portfolio investment in Ger-many because of reclassifications. Comparedwith 1998 and 1999, then, a fairly consider-able downturn emerges in foreign securitiesacquisitions in Germany last year. All in all,net capital exports of 316 billion arose
through securities transactions in 2001 com-pared with 3159
12billion in 2000 and 311
billion in 1999.
If account is taken of the instruments chosen
by German residents when investing in for-eign securities, it becomes clear that it is thedemand for foreign shares that has sufferedmost as a result of the downturn in worldeconomic growth and the gloomier profitprospects of many enterprises. Investors’ con-fidence was further shaken by the Septemberterrorist attacks in the United States, with theresult that, for a time, there was an outrightflight from investment in equities into thesafety of bonds and notes. All in all, Germaninvestors acquired foreign shares worth only316 billion last year; this was the lowest result
since 1996. However, it is worth noting that,despite its marked economic difficulties, theUnited States continued to account for thebulk of the shares purchased by Germansabroad. Evidently most German investors ex-pected that the US economy would make arapid recovery. The growing signs of a turnfor the better and the price movements in USequities proved them right up to a point; atall events, US shares performed significantlybetter last year (the Dow Jones IndustrialDM bn  5 bn

(Nikkei: -2312%).
German savers presumably also invested less
in foreign shares indirectly, ie through foreigninvestment companies, last year than theyhad done 12 months before. This is suggest-ed, firstly, by the fall in the purchases of for-eign investment fund certificates ( 319 billion
compared with 332
12billion in 2000); sec-
ondly, investor interest shifted to money mar-ket funds, according to the Federal Associ-ation of German Investment and Asset Man-agement Companies.

The bond markets benefited from the re-straint in equity investment. German invest-ors bought long-term foreign debt certificatesworth a total of 394
12billion last year; this
was 322 billion more than in 2000. As has
been the case since the start of EMU, mostdemand was for bonds denominated in euro(388 billion). A large amount of these invest-
able funds (approximately 363 billion) flowed
into other euro-area countries, whose gov-ernment bonds had a slight yield advantageover German government paper. However,the interest rate differential declined in thecourse of last year and amounted to only16 basis points – on average – at the end of2001.

44role again in the portfolio decisions of Ger-
man investors last year. All in all, German resi-dents spent 36
12billion net on debt securities
of this type, especially those denominated inUS dollars. At the same time, they sold, forexample, bonds denominated in yen andAustralian dollars. The concentration of pur-chases in the autumn of 2001 suggests thatUS government paper in particular benefitedfrom investors’ increased need for liquidityand security following the terrorist attacks inNew York and Washington. Another factorwas that holding gains could be expected onthe US bond market as a result of the interestrate cuts by the US central bank, and, as itturned out, the US yields on ten-year bondsin the autumn of 2001 fell below the Germanlevel for a time.
Conversely, the more subdued speculation
about euro-denominated bond rates mayhave been another reason why German debtsecurities attracted somewhat less inter-national investor interest last year. That ap-plied primarily to public bonds where salesexceeded purchases by foreign investors forthe first time since 1981 ( 35
12billion). Even
so, the high standing of Federal bonds, espe-cially in times of crisis, was evident in the au-tumn when foreign demand for these secureand highly liquid instruments showed a tem-porary marked increase. Foreign turnover inGerman public bonds also rose significantlylast year and almost regained the recordlevels of 1997 and 1998.
2
As in the previous two years, the bonds ofprivate-sector borrowers were in greater de-mand from non-residents last year than do-mestic government paper ( 360
12billion).
However, sales of this paper, predominantlybank bonds, benefited from, among otherthings, large sales and redemptions of moneymarket paper ( 332 billion), most of which
had likewise been issued by German credit in-stitutions. Evidently foreign investors wererestructuring their portfolios, and short-dateGerman paper, ie paper with maturities ofone year or less, were being replaced byslightly longer-date instruments which, in theeyes of foreign investors, probably had amore favourable risk-return profile.
There was also remarkably heavy demand
from non-residents on the German sharesmarket. Overall, non-residents invested a re-cord 389 billion in German equities. It is true
that an exchange of shares in connectionwith a corporate acquisition accounted forabout one-third of this. Even if this singletransaction is eliminated, however, foreigninterest in German shares was very consider-able, especially as price increases on the Ger-man share market were, as already men-tioned, below those on other markets. It ispossible that investors from outside the euroarea took advantage of the favourable cir-cumstances to build up their holdings ofshares in Europe. This is suggested by thefact that large amounts of investable fundsflowed into the share markets not only inGermany but also in the euro area as a whole(EMU: 3237
12billion).

creased the capital base of their branches andsubsidiaries in 2001; contrary to what hap-pened in the previous year, the granting ofintra-group credits played only a minor role.It was mainly enterprises from the othereuro-area countries that built up their pres-ence in Germany in 2001; about 70% of in-ward investment came from these countries.
German direct investment likewise declined
last year even if not quite as sharply as foreigninvestment in Germany. However, the peak ofGerman enterprises’ outward investment hadalready been reached in 1999. In 2001 Ger-man enterprises invested 348
12billion abroad
compared with 354 billion in 2000 and
310212billion in 1999, with the result that in
net terms 313 billion was exported from Ger-
many through direct investment in 2001. Themain item in Germany’s direct investmentabroad last year was the acquisition of a UStelecommunications enterprise. Although thisacquisition had been agreed in 2000, it couldnot take place until the cartel authorities hadcompleted a fairly lengthy investigation andonly after that could it be statistically record-ed. German direct investment abroad was
reduced by comparatively large sums whichwere borrowed by German parent companiesfrom their foreign affiliates ( 323 billion) and
which are shown as deductions in the directinvestment statistics. Among other things,these involve transactions with foreign sub-US$ bn

46sidiaries which look after the issue of debt
certificates for the international market andpass on the proceeds from the issue to theirparent company. As most of these financingcompanies are domiciled in neighbouringeuro-area countries and owing to the largeinvestment in the United States mentionedabove, the regional breakdown of Germandirect investment was seriously distorted in2001. For example, German enterprises with-drew funds (of 323
12billion) from other euro-
area countries while they invested heavily inthe United States for the most part ( 349 bil-
lion). For some years now there has also beena sizeable flow of investable funds (2001:33
12billion) into the central and east Euro-
pean countries in transition, which have alsobecome fairly important for German foreigntrade.In net terms, German non-banks drew on for-
eign sources of finance through statisticallyrecorded credit transactions last year. For ex-ample, enterprises and individuals imported310
12billion net; in the process they greatly
expanded the credit they raised from banksabroad in particular. Evidently they took ad-vantage of the integrating financial marketprovided by EMU. They also received fundsfrom abroad through advance payments onforeign trade business and a reduction in theremaining volume of their own trade credits.External public-sector operations also led toan influx of funds ( 316
12billion net). This was
due mainly to the fact that funds which pub-lic authorities had placed with foreign banksin September 2000 were used at the begin-ning of 2001 for an early redemption of debtcertificates issued by the Currency ConversionEqualisation Fund.
The non-securitised credit transactions of the
banking system as a whole (MFIs includingthe Bundesbank) resulted in fairly large out-flows of funds, by contrast. It was particularlythe German credit institutions that sharply ex-panded their non-securitised external invest-ments in 2001. For the first time for severalyears the asset-side business, ie the grantingof advances and loans to foreign customers,grew faster in terms of value than the liability-side business. Consequently, the Germanbanks exported 376
12billion net in 2001
compared with capital imports of 314 billion
in 2000. At the same time, however, 32612
billion in foreign funds accrued to the Bun-
desbank. As is usual since the start of monet-ary union, this was primarily the result of bal-ances arising within the large-value paymentDM bn  5 bn

47Impact of the introduction of euro banknotes and coins on the German balance of
payments
The changeover to the euro was already having
an impact on the German balance of payments
before the euro banknotes and coins were intro-
duced on 1 January 2002. In the course of 2001,
for example, large amounts of Deutsche Mark
banknotes were being returned to Germany
from abroad. Cross-border movements of bank-
notes have an effect on the balance of payments
if they result in a change in Germany’s liabilities
to non-residents. In practice, however, it is virtu-
ally impossible to record these currency flows
fully because most of the Deutsche Mark bank-
notes going abroad were taken there by travel-
lers. Statistics exist only on Deutsche Mark bank-
note flows to and from other countries which
were handled by the banking system, and past
experience has shown that it is primarily returns
that are recorded here; at all events, there is a
certain element of uncertainty about these statis-
tics. Gaps in recording would be acceptable pro-
vided the cross-border currency movements can-
celled out relatively quickly within the balance of
payments.1However, problems for the balance of
payments statistics arise when, over a period of
time, a fairly sizeable stock of German banknotes
is built up abroad or is greatly changed – and
that is precisely what has happened. There was a
considerable demand from non-residents for
Deutsche Mark banknotes, especially in the 1980s
and the beginning of the 1990s. Estimates at the
time – although these were subject to a high de-
gree of uncertainty – put the stock of Deutsche
Mark banknotes abroad at between DM65 billion
and DM90 billion.2It is likely that most of this
money has since been returned to Germany, and
some of it certainly during 2001. Depending on
how this money was repatriated, some of it may
have had an impact on the balancing item in the
German balance of payments.3Further return
flows of Deutsche Mark banknotes can be ex-
pected during the first few months of 2002;these, too, will have some effect on the balan-
cing item.
With the changeover to euro banknotes and
coins throughout the euro area, it has become
generally impossible to achieve a complete stat-
istical recording of currency movements. As a
rule, this will result in balancing items. Two ex-
amples may illustrate the problem.
– German banks’ cross-border cash consign-
ments within the euro area result in changes
in the external position of the domestic
banks involved, and these changes are re-
corded in the financial account. As the euro
banknotes dispatched are not statistically
recorded in full, there will generally be no
corresponding counter-entry. This alone will
result in a balancing item in the German bal-
ance of payments.
– Another statistical gap arises in connection
with foreign travel. When German residents
meet their travel costs in euro, this is normal-
ly reflected in the German current account,
that is to say, provided it is statistically re-
corded in the collection of travel data. But
here, too, there is no counter-entry in the
German balance of payments, and so once
again there will be a balancing item.
The problems addressed ultimately mean that in
future there will be (additional) “systemic” gaps
in the recording of cross-border transactions. To
that extent, the balancing item’s function to
provide a warning about potential errors in the
balance of payments will be impaired. Conse-
quently, the margins of uncertainty in the other
balance of payment items will also tend to in-
crease, and balance of payment analysis will be-
come even more difficult.
1An example of this would be travel expenditure by Ger-
man tourists abroad (= service imports) which, followingthe return of the Deutsche Mark banknotes, would resultin corresponding credits in favour of foreign banks at Ger-man credit institutions (= capital imports). — 2See F Seitz,
The circulation of the Deutsche Mark abroad, Economic Re-
search Group of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Discussionpaper 1/95, May 1995. — 3The decline in the Deutsche
Mark banknotes held by non-residents and not recorded inthe balance of payments has tended to reduce the(positive) balancing item. In other words, if it had beenpossible to capture these cash returns, the balancing itemin 2001 would have been even larger.

48system TARGET, which ultimately mean an in-
crease in the Bundesbank’s liabilities to theECB.
The foreign reserves of the Bundesbank,
which are shown separately in the balance ofpayments, declined as a result of transactionsby36 billion last year. A decline of a similar
amount had been recorded in 2000. The Bun-desbank has therefore reduced its foreign re-serves further. Including the amount trans-ferred to the ECB at the beginning of 1999,the foreign reserves – at transaction values –have declined by 324
12billion since the start
of EMU.4
If the interrelationship of the statistically re-corded transactions with non-residents in thebalance of payments are carefully examined,it becomes clear that the balances with a plussign – current account surplus ( 32
12billion)
and the decline in the foreign reserves ( 36 bil-
lion) – are accompanied by much larger bal-ances with a minus sign in financial trans-actions ( 346 billion) and capital transfers
(31 billion). This results in a balancing item of
338
12billion in the balance of payments. This
item reflects the incomplete and imprecise re-cording of cross-border transactions. In viewof the various sources of the data and the in-crease in reporting thresholds, it is practicallyimpossible to expect that the transactionsshown in the balance of payments will becompletely in equilibrium. Since the start ofmonetary union, however, the balancing itemhas been tending to increase, a developmentwhich, to a large extent, can presumably beexplained by the sharp rise in cross-bordertransactions, especially financial transactions.The problems associated with the balance of
payments statistics will probably not declinein future either. On the contrary, with theintroduction of euro banknotes and coins,avoiding balancing items is likely to becomeeven more difficult than before because theintroduction of the single currency providesanother reason for systemic gaps in recording(see the notes on page 47). It will also limitthe means of assessing the quality of the dataand the consistency of the statistical figuresin the balance of payments as a whole. TheBundesbank is therefore making an enor-mous effort to retain and improve the reliabil-ity and completeness of the remaining statis-tics by other means. For example, the moredetailed breakdown planned for the safe cus-tody account statistics will make it easier infuture to check the plausibility of portfoliotransactions. Analysing portfolio transactionssecurity by security, as planned, will alsomake it possible to identify missing reportsand reporting errors in this segment morequickly than hitherto and to take remedial ac-tion. Finally, the Coordinated Portfolio Invest-ment Survey which has been initiated by theInternational Monetary Fund and in whichGermany is also participating will providestock data which will augment existing infor-mation on securities transactions. All thesemeasures are ultimately designed to ensuredata quality in portfolio investment.
4The decline is hardly noticeable in the holdings valued
at current market prices because revaluation gains were
achieved through the rise in the US dollar exchange rate
and gold price. At the end of 2001 the foreign reserves
amounted to 393.2 billion compared with 393.9 billion
at the start of monetary union.Foreign

49The pass-through
from market interestrates to banklending ratesin GermanyBank lending rates play a key role in
the process of monetary policy trans-mission. An in-depth analysis wastherefore made of the relationship be-tween money market and capital mar-ket rates and the interest rates onlending by German banks in the 1990s.As a result, structural differences in theinterest rate pass-through became ap-parent across different banks. Thespeed at which lending rates adjust tochanges in market rates depends onbank size, the banks’ specific refinan-cing conditions and the extent of theirnon-bank business. In the case of cor-porate lending, in particular, credit in-stitutions only gradually adjust theirterms and conditions to changes inmarket rates. By smoothing their lend-ing rates, banks accept temporary fluc-tuations in their interest rate margin.The monetary policy transmission pro-cess therefore tends to take longer asmonetary policy measures are onlygradually passed on to households andnon-financial firms.
Bank rates and monetary policy

The monetary policy measures taken by the
central bank focus on the short-term inter-bank market. However, they also affect therates on all financial markets and thereby in-fluence aggregate demand and price devel-opments. According to the interest rate chan-nel theory, higher interest rates curb spending

50by households and firms while low interest
rates act as a stimulant.
According to the theoretical literature, banks
do not play an active role in monetary policytransmission via the interest rate channelsince bank credit and borrowing in the mar-ket or bank deposits and portfolio invest-ments are considered to be fully substitut-able. Both firms and banks can change to an-other type of financing without incurring anyadditional costs. However, things are differentin reality: most private enterprises cannotsimply raise funds in the money or capitalmarkets as an alternative to bank credit asthe various lenders have insufficient informa-tion about the enterprises’ creditworthiness.The banks are equally unable to raise re-sources on the same terms in the market asan alternative to their deposits. Moreover, thecredit institutions do not have unlimited li-quidity reserves and may only be able to par-tially adjust their assets following a monetarypolicy tightening. All these factors may resultin monetary policy impulses affecting thebanks’ credit supply and consequently cor-porate investment activity. In the economicsliterature, reference is made in this connec-tion to the credit channel, which operates inparallel to the interest rate channel.
1
In the context of the monetary policy trans-mission process, an important role is assignedto bank interest rates. What is of particularinterest is the speed and the extent to whichGerman banks adjust their lending rates tointerest rate movements in the money or cap-ital markets.
2These interest rate relationships
are, of course, only one component of themonetary policy impulses that are transmitted
via bank interest rates. The extent to whichinvestment by firms and borrowing by theother non-banks depend on bank lendingrates is also important. In addition, the effectof the banks’ deposit rates on households’savings and investment decisions is anotherfactor for consideration.
As a general rule, banks adjust their lending
rates to changes in market rates only gradual-ly. However, the extent to which this appliesto the different types of credit varies (see thechart on page 51). An anticyclical curve ofthe mark-up between the average lendingrate and a market rate with a similar maturitybecomes apparent, especially in the case ofcorporate lending rates. By contrast, the cor-responding interest rate mark-up for five-yearmortgage rates changes little over the inter-est rate cycle. This observation for the aver-age interest rates is an indication that interestrate smoothing is more important for corpor-ate lending rates and less important for mort-gage rates. Lending rate stickiness may becaused by several factors. The more uncertainbanks are about the future development ofgeneral market rates, the longer they are like-ly to leave their lending rates unchanged. Adelayed response may also be due to adjust-ment costs, with the result that preference isgiven to making less frequent, but largerinterest rate changes over continuously ad-

51justing interest rates. In addition, shifts in
credit demand3and changes in the banks’
competitive position can influence pass-through. If competition is weak, the banksmay tend, for instance, to increase their inter-est rate margin in periods of falling interestrates by reducing their lending rates moreslowly than their deposit rates. Similarly, inperiods of increasing market rates, bankscould try to delay a narrowing of their marginby passing rising refinancing costs promptlyon to their customers in the form of higherlending rates. Accordingly, the speed atwhich their lending rates adjust to marketrates can vary over the interest rate cycle,with the result that interest rate margins donot follow the market rate in a uniformlyanticyclical manner. Rather, lending ratestend to be adjusted less markedly in periodsof falling interest rates and more rapidly intimes of rising interest rates.

through.6
On the basis of aggregate data, it is, however,virtually impossible to test for the relevanceof the different explanatory approaches. Thealternative is to analyse the interest rate re-ports made by the individual banks. Balancesheet features can thus provide informationabout a bank’s ability to isolate its lendingrate policy from market conditions. The ex-tent to which the adjustment behaviour ofGerman bank lending rates in the 1990s coin-cides with a specific balance sheet profile hastherefore been reviewed. This issue is particu-larly relevant from the monetary policy per-spective as bank loans still play an importantrole in corporate financing in Germany. In2000 outstanding loans by monetary financialinstitutions to enterprises amounted to justunder 40% of total external corporate finan-cing, with small enterprises displaying anabove-average dependence on bank loans.From the banks’ point of view, too, lendingto non-banks (including enterprises) is an im-portant part of their total business – even ifits role is declining for certain categories ofbanks. Last year non-bank loans accountedfor just under half of the banks’ balancesheet total and loans to firms and self-employed persons for around one-fifth.
Interest rate response and balance sheet
structure
Several considerations favour differences in
the adjustment response across individualbanks to changing conditions in the financialmarkets. The differences in the credit institu-
tions’ refinancing conditions are frequentlystressed as a factor influencing the level ofthe lending rate.
7Banks with market-
oriented refinancing costs possibly dependmore on adjusting their credit terms thanbanks whose liability structure is less influ-enced by interest rate changes in the market.
Savings deposits probably play a particular
role in this respect. Although the interestrates on savings deposits have recently be-come more variable, savings deposits in Ger-many nonetheless represent an importantcategory of deposits whose interest rates areaffected comparatively little by market ratemovements. They are mainly available tobanks as longer-term deposits. Institutionswhich resort extensively to these kinds of de-posits for refinancing purposes feel less pres-surised to promptly adjust their lending ratesthan institutions whose refinancing costs in-crease at the same time and to a similar ex-tent as market rates. This suggests that lend-ing rate setting by German banks depends,among other factors, on the share of its cus-tomers’ savings deposits. The more intenselya bank competes with other financial institu-tions or with the securities markets, the moreit will need to adjust its refinancing rates to

53the corresponding market conditions. In fact,
the development of money market and in-vestment funds since 1994 and the tendencyfor bank deposits to become less importantindicate that bank customers are makinggreater use of alternative forms of invest-ment.
8At the same time, the dependence on
bank loans decreased in the 1990s, especiallyfor firms that were able to make use of alter-native sources of financing as a result of im-proved access to the money market or thecapital market.
9
In addition to the various refinancing condi-tions, the prime role of the “housebank” inthe German financial system may account fora certain amount of interest rate smoothing.In a “housebank relationship”, the bank tem-porarily accepts lower margins in periods ofrising interest rates so as not to jeopardiselong-term customer loyalty and the associ-ated information advantages over other cap-ital providers. In good and in difficult times,the borrower has the advantage of beingable to rely on business relations that havebeen built up over time. This is particularly at-tractive to smaller-scale borrowers whowould be unable to borrow from anothersource on the same terms as would be avail-able on a loan from their “housebank”. Theborrower “pays for” this advantage to a cer-tain extent by a higher interest rate mark-upin periods of falling interest rates. Interestrate smoothing thus follows on from splittingrisk between the bank and its customers.
10
“Housebank relationships” may also operatein terms of deposits, in which case the bank isthe borrower. Similarly, it is not easy to bor-row on the same terms in the market as analternative to bank deposits. The harder it is
for the bank to find alternative sources of fi-nancing, the more intensely it will cultivateclose, lasting relations with its depositors.
In the study described in this article, the
banks’ status as “housebanks” is approxi-mated by the share of long-term non-bankbusiness in the balance sheet total. Long-term non-bank business was calculated asthe total of loans to non-banks and non-banks’ deposits with agreed maturities ofmore than one year. The thinking behind thisis that it is in the interests of a bank with rela-tively extensive long-term non-bank businessto maintain close relationships with its cus-tomers and it therefore lays greater store onacting as a “housebank” than one whoselong-term non-bank business is only of minorimportance.
Bank size is frequently taken as a further de-
terminant of the extent to which, in terms oftheir lending business, banks respond tomonetary policy impulses.

the credit channel, it is assumed that the sizeof a credit institution is related to its ability tocall on alternative sources of refinancing and

54thus, to a degree, to “side-step” a restrictive
monetary policy. Accordingly, small bankswhose deposits decrease as a result of a tight-ening of monetary policy can raise only limit-ed additional finances in the market and con-sequently may have to restrict their lending.For Germany, however, there are indicationsthat smaller banks are less affected by finan-cing shortages if they belong to a bankingfederation and can borrow through their cen-tral institution.
12For Germany, bank size is
therefore not a reliable indicator of the avail-ability of alternative forms of refinancing. Forthis reason the refinancing conditions ofmany small banks probably do not worsenfollowing a restrictive monetary policy or doso only to a limited extent. Contrary to thecredit channel theory, their lending rates cantherefore be expected to respond less tointerest rate increases in the market thanthose of large banks.
Nonetheless, a certain correlation between
the size of a bank and that of its borrowersmay well exist. It can be assumed that bor-rowers from small institutions are frequentlysmall and medium-sized enterprises, whichare more dependent on bank loans, whereaslarger institutions lend more to larger firms,which have alternative means of raising fi-nance in the market. As a rule, this is likely tobe reflected in larger banks setting interestrates more closely in line with market condi-tions. Bank size would therefore be signifi-cant mainly in terms of corporate lending.
Although the possibility that the size of a
bank is related to its savings deposits and itstotal long-term non-bank business cannot beruled out, these three determinants of the
lending rate pass-through were analysed in-dependently of one another.
For the purpose of analysing the lending rate
policy of German banks, short-term andlong-term loan categories were selected. Forshort-term lending business, the Bundesbankcollects data, for instance, on current accountcredit rates charged on new credit line agree-ments or on their renewal. Current accountcredit frequently represents standard loans tocorporate customers. Rather than a fixed rateof interest, in these loan agreements a mark-up of the money market rate is usuallyoffered to “blue-chip” customers, with amark-up of an internal bank prime rate apply-ing for other borrowers. For long-term loans,interest rates on new business or renewalsare taken, as relating to both five-year mort-gage loans and longer-term corporate loanswith an agreed interest rate lock-in period ofmore than five years. With regard to theaforementioned interest rates, an analysiswas carried out to determine whether thereare adjustment differences between banks.However, no clear conclusions can be drawnabout differences in the pass-through acrossthe loan categories or about the intensity ofcompetition in the credit markets concerned.
The rates for short-term and long-term cor-
porate loans are reported for various size cat-egories. Up to the end of 2001, the rates re-ported on current account credit were subdiv-

55ided according to loan size into “less than
DM200,000”, “DM200,000 and over but lessthan DM1 million” and “DM1 million andover but less than DM5 million”.
13In the case
of interest rates on long-term corporateloans, loans of DM200,000 and over but lessthan DM1 million were distinguished fromloans of DM1 million and over but less thanDM10 million. In each loan category and sizecategory the reported interest was thatagreed for most of the new business or re-newals in the middle two weeks of eachmonth. The bank interest rate data are there-fore not available at the level of individualloans but are modal values in the categoriesconcerned.
As data on bank interest rates are collected
each month, monthly average market rateswere used as the reference rates. The criter-ion for the selection of market rates was acomparable maturity. Up to June 1996 theFrankfurt overnight rate was taken as the ref-erence rate for the short-term current ac-count credit rates, which are dependent onthe money market; up to December 1998 theFiona rates were used and from January 1999the Eonia rates. For long-term corporate lend-ing rates, the yield on German fixed-ratebearer debt securities outstanding was takenas the reference rate. The yield on Germandebt securities outstanding with a mean re-sidual maturity of more than four and up tofive years was selected as the reference ratefor the fixed mortgage rate locked in for fiveyears.
In order to test for differences in the lending
rate response across banks, some 350 institu-tions which reported lending rates in the
period under review were classified accordingto size, this being determined by the balancesheet total. Banks were also classified accord-ing to their savings deposits in relation totheir total liabilities and on the basis of theshare of long-term business with non-banksin their balance sheet total. With respect tothe period under review, average balancesheet indicators have been calculated foreach bank. Based on the distribution of theseindicators, bank categories comprising aroughly similar number of banks were estab-lished (see the table on page 56).
The stickiness of bank lending rates was esti-
mated using an error correction model.
14
With regard to a simple model with monopol-istic competition, it was assumed that the fac-tors influencing the equilibrium mark-up be-tween the lending rate and the market rate,in particular the bank’s borrower and riskstructure, do not change during the periodunder review. The estimated model providesinformation on short-term interest rate dy-namics and on the adjustment to the equilib-rium loan mark-up. It regresses the change inthe bank lending rate on the lending ratechanges in the previous months and on con-temporary and lagged changes in the marketrate. In addition to these variables, an errorcorrection term reflects the adjustment to thelong-run equilibrium loan mark-up. It de-
13Up to November 1996 the reported current account
lending rates were subdivided into two categories only:
“less than DM1 million” and “DM1 million and over but
less than DM5 million”.

plained in the annex. In particular, the error correction

56scribes the gap between the actual loan
mark-up and the long-run equilibrium loanmark-up. This equilibrium mark-up is not dir-ectly observable. It was approximated foreach interest rate reporting bank by the aver-age mark-up in the period under review. Inorder to test empirically whether the afore-mentioned balance sheet characteristics af-fect the adjustment of the lending rates totheir equilibrium, the interest rate reportingbanks were classified according to the bal-ance sheet indicators described above. Pass-through estimations were carried out foreach category of bank.
15The speed of adjust-
ment in the upper and lower bank categories,as derived from the estimation coefficients,was then compared.The table on page 61 shows the estimated
long-run pass-through and the estimatedspeed of adjustment for the upper and lowercategories.
16The long-run interest rate rela-
tionships consistently have the expected signand are invariably statistically significant.Given the formulated hypotheses, the differ-ences in the adjustment process between thevarious bank categories have the expectedsign in almost every case. The adjustment dif-ferences between the upper and lower cat-egories are significant in the majority ofcases.
17As expected, differences in the long-
run equilibrium relationship between lendingand market rates are insignificant in almostall estimations. This suggests that, irrespectiveof their adjustment process, apart from aconstant bank-specific mark-up, all interestrate reporting banks achieve the same long-run relationship. It is nonetheless striking thatonly a weak long-term pass-through occursfor current account credit rates: in manycases a fall in the market rate simply leads toa decline in the lending rates of roughly 70%.This is possibly attributable to an incompleteinterest rate cycle in the money market in theestimation period with a distinct fall in inter-est rates (see the chart on page 51).

58of rising and falling market rates, tend, how-
ever, to absorb the full extent of changes inthe underlying market rate over the long run.
The adjustment paths of the lending rates in
the first 12 months after a simulated 1% mar-ket rate decrease suggest the following (seethe chart on page 57):
– Larger credit institutions adjust their credit
terms to changes in market rates morequickly than smaller credit institutions.This might be explained by the fact thatsmaller credit institutions, whose custom-ers rely more on bank loans, need to com-pete less with market conditions.
– Those banks which use savings deposits as
a major means of refinancing adjust theirlending rates to changes in market ratescomparatively slowly. Despite increasinglydifferentiated interest rates in the periodunder review, sizeable savings depositholdings constituted a relatively stable re-financing basis, permitting greater interestrate adjustment. Banks which have fewsavings deposits relative to their liabilitiesalign their credit terms far more closelywith money and capital market rates.
– Those banks with a major share of long-
term non-bank business adjust their lend-ing rates comparatively slowly to changesin the market rates. A possible interpret-ation is that the extent of the long-termnon-bank business gives some insight intothe importance of “housebank relation-
ships”.
Summary and conclusions
The results of the econometric analysis of
lending rates taken from the Deutsche Bun-desbank’s banking statistics reveal structuraldifferences in the way banks respond tochanges in interest rates in the money andcapital markets. In line with the literature andtheoretical considerations, the empirical re-sults for the period from 1993 to 2000 con-firm that there is a connection between bal-ance sheet features of German credit institu-tions and the adjustment of their lendingrates in response to monetary policy meas-ures. In most cases a delayed interest rateresponse was associated with smaller-sizedbanks, more stable refinancing conditionsand a high proportion of long-term non-bankbusiness. However, the extent to which theeffect of these variables is interdependentwas not analysed. As expected, however, interms of the long-run relationship betweenlending and market rates, there were by andlarge no significant differences across banks.The impact of bank lending rate changes onthe corresponding loan volumes was not ana-lysed. An empirical investigation of this, inaddition to the pass-through analysis carriedout in this study, could help to complete thepicture of the monetary policy implications ofbank lending rate stickiness.

59Annex
The following error correction model is used to de-
termine the pass-through of market rates to banklending rates:
∆rt = Σ ϕk ∆rt–k + Σ ωq ∆mt–q
        + α [rt–1 – β mt–1 – C] + εtk=1 q=0K Q
In this specification it is assumed that, in addition
to its values in the previous periods, the lendingrate r is determined solely by an exogenous marketrate. The error term e
tis normally distributed and
not serially correlated. The dependent variableis the change in the lending rate Dr
t. The estima-
tion model includes an error correction term[r
t-1–bmt-1– C] which describes the adjustment
of the lending rate r to its long-run equilibriummark-up C on the market rate, as well as laggedvariables which capture information about theshort-term dynamics of the lending rate. The appli-cation of this estimation method presumes the ex-istence of a stationary long-run mark-up betweenthe lending rate and the market rate, that is of anequilibrium interest rate relationship C. Stationaritymeans that this relationship has no trend and isthus constant over time. This model is estimatedfor a panel of banks:
∆ri,t = µi + Σ ϕk ∆ri,t–k + Σ ωq ∆mt–q
         + α [ri,t–1 – β mt–1] + εi,tk=1 q=0K Q
Here a bank-specific equilibrium mark-up is intro-
duced which is part of the constant mi. This equilib-
rium mark-up is approximated for each bank i bythe average mark-up over the period under review.This estimation method (known as the within esti-mation with fixed effects) is based on the assump-tion that the lending rate change Dr
i,tof bank i has
the same determinants as the other banks exceptfor a systematic level shift that is constant overtime. This implies the assumption that other fac-tors influencing the equilibrium mark-up, particu-larly the bank’s cost and risk structures, remain un-changed in the estimation period.
The model provides a loading coefficient aand a
pass-through elasticity. The loading coefficientcontains information about the speed of ad-justment to the temporary deviation from thelong-run level relationship and must be sig-nificantly negative if the assumption of a station-ary equilibrium mark-up is substantiated. Thepass-through elasticity indicates the percentageof a simulated market rate shock reflected in thelending rate after t periods. Accordingly, in theperiod following a 1% change in the market rate(Dm
t-1=m t-1= 1) a pass-through elasticity of
a=j1w0+w1+aw0–ab+w0results if the im-
mediate lending rate change corresponds to thelevel of the lending rate in the preceding period,ieDr
t-1=ri,t-1=w0. To calculate this pass-through
elasticity, the loading coefficient ais therefore re-
quired.
For the period under review, average balance
sheet indicators are calculated for each bank.Based on the distribution of these indicators, threebank categories each containing a roughly similarnumber of banks are then derived. Subsequently,error correction estimations are carried out whichtake the following form:
∆ri,t = µi + Σ { Σ  ϕn,k ∆ri,t–k Di,n+ Σ ωn,q ∆mt–q Di,n
         – αn [ri,t–1 – βn mt–1] Di,n  } + εi,tk=1K

This estimation approach is based on the assump-
tion that although the banks differ from one cat-egory to another in terms of their response para-meters – albeit with the exception of the bank-specific constant, which reflects their long-runmark-up – they do not differ within a category.Changes in the balance sheet structure over timeare not taken into account. The dummy variableD
1of category 1 thus assumes the value of 1 if the
interest rate reporting bank records an averagebalance sheet characteristic which is to be as-signed to the upper bank category. Otherwise, thedummy variable 1 in category 1 has the value ofzero. Much the same applies to the dummy vari-ables in categories 2 and 3. Interaction terms arethen defined for all model variables as the productof the dummy variables of one category and eachmodel variable. The interaction term thus equalsthe model variable if the interest reporting bank isto be assigned to the respective category.
This approach permits an estimation and a com-
parison of the differences across the bank categor-ies to be made in terms of the loading coefficientand pass-through elasticity, all of which describetheir interest rate setting behaviour, as well as withrespect to the long-run relationship between lend-ing and market rates. The latter equilibrium mark-up is important in terms of the implication of theestimates. In order to allow a comparison betweenthe adjustment processes – ie between the pass-through elasticities or between the loading coeffi-cients – the coefficients b, capturing the long-run
relationship, should not differ significantly acrossbanks. If, in the long run, not all banks achieve asimilar interest rate relationship, the adjustmentpaths are not comparable either. Only if all banksachieve the same long-run relationship – apartfrom the bank-specific mark-up – does the model
provide information about adjustment differencesbetween banks. It is assumed that each bank doesnot have a different adjustment path and that thelending rates within the bank categories respondsimilarly to changes in the market rate. In order totest for differences between the estimated pass-through measure x
1of the upper bank category
and the estimated pass-through measure x 3of the
lower bank category, the variance of the functionx
1–x3is estimated using the delta method.18As-
suming asymptotic normal distribution, the null hy-pothesis H
0:x1–x3= 0 is tested.
The interest rate series are subjected to an adjust-
ment for outliers. The problem posed by outliervalues in the data is that, in the within estimationswith fixed effects, high absolute levels of themodel variables are weighted more heavily thanlow levels. Hence those outlier values which aremore than four times the standard deviation fromthe average are eliminated. Moreover, the min-imum length of the bank time series is defined as20 consecutive monthly interest rate reports. Forreasons of asymptotics, this is necessary in theerror correction estimates performed here. If atime series with a break is available for a bank, twoseparate time series are generated from the bank’soriginal time series.
Overall, in the period under review, more than 200
takeovers and mergers took place among theinterest rate reporting banks, where the bankwhich existed after the takeover or merger report-ed interest rates to the Bundesbank. A takeover ormerger can, in principle, lead to a change in lend-ing rate policy or, owing to changed customer pat-terns, to a new lending rate level. Hence, in the
