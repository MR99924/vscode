ManufacturingThe economic slowdown in manufacturing,
which began at the end of the winter, did notcontinue in May. In seasonally adjusted terms,there was an upturn in both new orders andoutput compared with the previous months.In particular, some large business transactionswith foreign customers made a positive con-tribution to orders, but incoming domesticorders also stabilised.
Nonetheless, taking the two spring months
of April and May together, the situation withregard to orders for manufactured goods wasless positive than in the first quarter of 2001.Once the usual seasonal adjustments hadbeen made, the level of orders fell by around2%. Orders were down by 1
1IYvk2% year on
year, whereas an average 41IYvk4% growth was
recorded from January to March.
The picture for growth in manufacturing out-
put was similar. Here, too, despite the slightimprovement in May, the output volume inthe two-month period from April to May wasstill well below that achieved in the first quar-ter of 2001 – by around 3% in seasonally ad-justed terms. At the end of the period underreview, output ceased to outstrip the equiva-lent result for the previous year, although thishad still been exceeded by a good 6%, onaverage, in the first three months of the year.Orders received

6Construction
The situation in construction eased slightly in
the spring. Orders in April (further data areunavailable at present) went up slightly inseasonally adjusted terms from the very lowlevel of the previous months. Although, at5
1IYvk4%, they were well below the previous
year’s figures, in the first quarter the averageshortfall was more than 9%. In both com-mercial and public-sector construction, moreorders were placed than previously. Residen-tial building contracts were by and large atthe same level as in the previous months.
Adjusted for the normal seasonal fluctu-
ations, construction output recovered in Maycompared with the two preceding months.However, as it had previously been very low,output in the two-month period from April toMay continued to lag well behind the firstquarter. The year-on-year fall of 14
1IYvk2%( a l -
though this figure is subject to qualificationuntil it is adjusted to the annual overall sur-vey) was indicative of the underlying situationin the construction sector, which continuedto be unfavourable.
LabourmarketOn the labour market, the signs of a slow-
down in the pace of economic growth wereclearly visible. According to estimates by theFederal Statistical Office, in seasonally adjust-ed terms the April figure for the number ofpersons in work was again unchanged. At38.71 million it was no higher than at thestart of the year. Year-on-year growth, whichhad still been somewhat above 1% in Janu-EconomicconditionsinGermany*

7ary, fell to just over1IYvk2%, representing
235,000 persons.
In June there was again a slight seasonally ad-
justed rise in unemployment. At the end ofthe period under review, there were 3.85 mil-lion jobless persons, i.e. 80,000 more than atthe last low in December 2000. The positionin 2000 was undershot by 30,000, comparedwith 240,000 at the end of 2000. Accordingto the calculations of the Federal LabourOffice, the unemployment rate was 9.3%;according to the EU-standardised unemploy-ment rate it was 7.8%.
The number of persons taking part in labour
market policy measures continued to de-crease. In particular, far fewer people tookpart in job creation programmes than oneyear previously. This was far from offset by in-creasing the integration subsidy and expand-ing the additional assistance programmesprovided by the Federal Labour Office.
PricesThe year-on-year rate of increase in consumer
prices has probably passed its peak. The gapat least narrowed to 3.1% in June, after3.5% in the previous month. Energy prices,especially prices for mineral oil products,were decisive both for the previous increaseand for the current decline. Excluding energy,the rate of price increases was 2.4% in bothMay and June. By the end of the periodunder review, food prices had risen far morestrongly, by 6.9%. There was also an above-average increase of 3.1% in service prices. Bycontrast, housing rents and industrial goodshad a restraining influence, prices having
risen by around 1% in each case in the past12 months.
The most recent reports point to a fall in
international oil prices in the course of Juneand the first weeks of July. At the end of theperiod under review, a barrel of Brent NorthSea oil cost just under US$ 25. That was virtu-ally at the March level, but considerably lessthan one year previously, when the price wasstill around US$ 29. Owing to the weakeningof the euro on the international foreignexchange markets, if calculated in DeutscheMark, the development was less favourable.However, prices did not reach the level of theprevious year.
Seasonally adjusted import prices rose steeply
again in May (further data are unavailable atpresent). This had a lot to do with a tempor-ary increase in energy prices. However, be-cause prices had gone up more strongly inthe reference period 2000, the annual rate ofincrease nonetheless went down to 4.0%,from 5.1% in April. Excluding energy, theyear-on-year rate of price increases was2.1%, compared with 2.6% previously.
At the end of the period under review, the
seasonally adjusted domesticselling pric es ofmanufactured goods again rose only slightly.The year-on-year difference, which in Aprilrose to + 5.0%, declined in May to + 4.6%.Excluding energy, the year-on-year increase inprices was 2.0%.

GovernmentindebtednessGovernment indebtedness increased by 32
1IYvk2
billion in May after having shown no change
in April. The Federal Government’s net bor-rowing rose by 31 billion altogether. While it
marginally cut its money market debt, itraised fresh funds from the capital market,principally through special five-year Federalbonds (Bobls), the outstanding volume of
which expanded by 31
1IYvk4billion as a result. It
also raised its net indebtedness in respect ofFederal Treasury notes ( 3
3IYvk4billion) and Fed-
eral bonds (Bunds–31IYvk2billion). By contrast,
redemptions of Federal savings bonds out-weighed the corresponding sales on balanceby31 billion.
The indebtedness of the LIYvvOnder Governments
increased by 31
1IYvk4billion in May. To cover
their financing requirements they resortedpredominantly to short-term cash advancesfrom banks and to loans against borrowers’notes. In addition, for the first time this yearone Land Government launched securitieswith a maturity of less than a year. The off-budget special funds expanded their newborrowing slightly; a notable feature in thisconnection was the rise by 3
1IYvk2billion in the
liabilities of the ERP Special Fund as part of aBundissue. Local government debt appears
to have fallen slightly in May.
FederalGovernmentborrowingIn June, the Federal Government tapped the
capital markets for 311
1IYvk2billion gross whileredeeming just over 391IYvk2billion. At the
same time it cut its money market debt by asubstantial 36
1IYvk4billion, so that its net in-
debtedness contracted by 341IYvk2billion.
The main instrument of its gross borrowing
was a regular new issue of Federal Treasurynotes with a coupon of 4.25%, which yield-ed just short of 38
1IYvk2billion for the Federal
Government. After deducting redemptionsamounting to 37 billion and taking into ac-
count a decline in the volume set aside formarket management operations, the net sumyielded by Federal Treasury notes was 32 bil-
lion. Sales of market management stocks ofBunds and Bobls raised a combined total of
just over 32 billion. Very modest sales of Fed-
eral savings bonds contrasted with sizeablerepayments, as a result of which their volumeNetborrowinginthemarket

9outstanding decreased by 321IYvk4billion on
balance.
In the first six months of 2001, taken to-
gether, the Federal Government’s debt fell by324
1IYvk2billion. If the repayment of equalisa-
tion claims of 333 billion from the UMTS
proceeds is disregarded, the Federal Govern-ment’s net borrowing would have increasedby38
1IYvk2billion. This figure was marginally ex-
ceeded in the first half of last year. For 2001as a whole the Federal budget envisages anew borrowing requirement of 322
1IYvk2billion,
which is slightly less than the correspondingfigure budgeted for 2000. Net borrowing sofar this year has largely taken the form of(ten-year) Bundissues, the outstanding vol-
ume of which has risen by 311 billion net.
But greater recourse was also had to debt se-curities with shorter maturities comparedwith the first half of last year. Thus the out-standing volume of two-year Federal Treasurynotes rose by almost 34
1IYvk2billion, or 10%, to
349 billion, while the outstanding amount of
Treasury discount paper (Bubills) expanded by
32 billion, or 20%, to nearly 312 billion. By
contrast, the decline in indebtedness in theform of Federal savings bonds and loansagainst borrowers’ notes accelerated further.At about 35
1IYvk2billion in each case, net re-
demptions of these two instruments weremore than twice as high as in the first sixmonths of 2000. Following its virtual elimin-ation at the end of last year, money marketdebt was expanded by almost 34 billion dur-
ing the first half of the current year.Securitiesmarkets
BondmarketSales in the German bond market increased
slightly in May. Domesticborrowers issuedbonds to the market value of 363.0 billion,
compared with 357.4 billion in the previous
month. Owing to the higher level of redemp-tions, net sales of debt securities continued tobe subdued, at 36.3 billion, and were only
slightly above the level of April ( 35.0 billion).
Foreign bonds were placed in the Germanmarket to the value of 312.1 billion net; the
vast bulk of these bonds were denominatedin euro. In May, the outstanding amount ofdomesticand foreign bonds ( 318.5 billion)
increased slightly more than in the previousmonth ( 315.3 billion).FederalGovernmentborrowinginthe

10In May, the public sector increased its bonded
debt by 32.7 billion. The Federal Govern-
ment issued its own bonds in the amount of32.5 billion net. It launched a ten-year Fed-
eral bond issue at 5%, with a total volume of38 billion, and increased its five-year special
Federal bonds series 137, at 5%, by 37 bil-
lion. Net of redemptions, sales of ten-yearFederal bonds and five-year special Federalbonds yielded 31.3 billion and 31.2 billion,
respectively. The outstanding amount of two-year Treasury notes went up by 30.9 billion.
Federal savings bonds, by contrast, were re-deemed to the extent of 31.1 billion net.
1In
May, the LIYvvOnder Governments raised 30.1
billion (net) in the bond market.
In May, credit institutions raised 31.0 billion
net from sales of their own debt securities,and thus once again less than in the pre-
ceding month ( 31.2 billion). Other bank
bonds predominated ( 35.0 billion). On bal-
ance, mortgage bonds (Hypothekenpfand-
briefe)were issued to the extent of 30.3
billion, while communal bonds (/C214ffentliche
Pfandbriefe) and bonds of specialised credit
institutions were repurchased to the amountsof32.9 billion (net) and 31.4 billion (net),
respectively. In May, sales of corporate bonds(at32.6 billion) were significantly heavier
than in April ( 31.0 billion).
In May, no Deutsche Mark/euro bonds issued
by non-residents under the lead-managementof a German syndicate were launched. Owingto the higher level of redemptions (comparedwith the previous month), the amount out-standing declined by 34.3 billion.
On the buyers’ side of the bond market, do-
mesticc redit institutions were in the forefrontin May. They enlarged their bond portfoliosby310.7 billion, 37.0 billion of that sum
being accounted for by foreign paper and33.7 billion by German securities. Domestic
non-banks increased their holdings of bondsand notes by 38.5 billion. Specifically, they
sold domesticbonds issued by private bor-rowers to the extent of 32.0 billion, and
bought debt securities issued by the publicsector to the tune of 35.4 billion. On bal-
ance, they invested 35.1 billion in foreign
bonds. In May, foreign investors reduced theirSalesandpurchasesofbonds

EquitymarketIssuing activity in the German equity market
almost came to a standstill in May. Domesticenterprises placed new shares to the marketvalue of only 30.5 billion (April: 31.0 billion).
Foreign equities were sold in the Germanmarket to the tune of 334.6 billion; thus
sales of equities totalled 335.1 billion.
In May, purchases of shares were determined
by the takeover of a US enterprise by a Ger-man firm, which was largely implemented byan exchange of shares. In May, foreign invest-ors bought German shares totalling 344.5
billion net as portfolio investments, almost330 billion of which in the context of the
takeover. Domesticnon-banks exc hanged do-mesticpaper (– 338.1 billion net) on a con-
siderable scale for foreign securities ( 332.7
billion). On balance, their share holdings de-creased by 35.4 billion. Domesticc redit insti-
tutions sold equities amounting to 34.0 bil-
lion net.
InvestmentfundcertificatesThe aggregate amount raised by investment
funds came to 32.3 billion in May, compared
with 36.4 billion in the previous month. Per-
formance was thus about as subdued as inthe equity market. Domesticfunds open tothe general publicsold c ertific ates to the ex-tent of 31.1 billion net. Share-based funds
received the major part of this amount, at30.7 billion. Open-end real-estate funds re-ceived 30.4 billion. The outstanding amount
of certificates issued by mixed funds andbond-based funds, by contrast, declined by30.3 billion and 30.1 billion, respectively.
Certificates of specialised funds were repur-chased, to the extent of 30.2 billion net. In
May, foreign fund certificates amounting to31.4 billion were placed in the German mar-
ket.
The investment fund certificates were mainly
bought by residents ( 33.0 billion). Non-banks
increased their holdings of domestic and for-eign certificates by 32.2 billion and 31.2 bil-
lion, respectively. Altogether, they purchasedinvestment fund certificates totalling 33.4
billion. Credit institutions, by contrast, with-drew resources from investment funds ( 30.5
billion). Foreign investors sold domesticfundcertificates to the tune of 30.7 billion.
Balanceofpayments
Germany’s current account – the combined
outcome of foreign trade, services transac-tions, factor income and current transfers –ran a surplus of 30.6 billion in May, com-
pared with 32.0 billion in the previous
month. This result was due to higher net ex-penditure on “invisible” current transactions.
According to calculations by the Federal Stat-
istical Office, a surplus of 37.6 billion was re-
corded on merchandise transactions in May,compared with one of 35.4 billion in April.
After adjustment for seasonal variations, too,the trade surplus increased. The main reasonfor that was a decline in imports of goods,Sales of shares

12which in May (seasonally adjusted) were just
over 6% below the April level. This percep-tible decrease, however, has to be viewed inthe context of developments over the previ-ous months, when imports fluctuated ratherstrongly. Taking the average of the last twomonths (April/May), German merchandise im-ports therefore rose by almost 1% over theaverage of the first quarter of 2001. In May(seasonally adjusted), German merchandiseexports went down by 1% compared withthe previous month. As a monthly average ofApril/May, exports of goods fell slightly shortof the average of the first quarter (–
1IYvk4%).
In the case of “invisible” current transactions
with non-residents, the deficit rose from 32.9
billion in April to 36.4 billion in May. This was
due partly to higher net expenditure on ser-vices ( 33.7 billion in May, against 32.3 billion
in the previous month). Current transfers tonon-residents also increased somewhat onbalance (to 32.5 billion, compared with 32.2
billion in April). Above all, factor income,which is subject to fairly sharp fluctuationsfrom month to month, saw net expenditurein the amount of 30.3 billion, following a
surplus of 31.7 billion in April.
The financial account registered large inflows
of funds in May, as a result of cross-borderportfolio transactions, while heavy outflowswere recorded in the field of direct invest-ment. These developments owed a great dealto a corporate take-over in the telecommuni-cations sector, which was largely carried outby means of an exchange of shares. Overall,direct investment abroad by German firms to-talled 335.5 billion. Owing to the simultan-Majoritemsofthebalance

In contrast to the heavy German direct in-
vestment abroad, a considerable volume ofGerman securities was transferred to foreignowners. Altogether, foreign holders tookover 344.5 billion of German equities in
May; about two-thirds of them presumablychanged hands in connection with the imple-mentation of the afore-mentioned take-over.In the case of money-market paper andpublicbonds, by c ontrast, redemptions andsales by non-residents ( 33.4 billion and 32.7
billion, respectively) on balance outweighednew purchases, while private bonds con-tinued to meet with foreign investors’ interest(35.3 billion). In total, purchases of German
securities by non-residents came to 343.0 bil-
lion, after foreign investors had withdrawnfunds from the German market on balance inthe preceding months ( 35.5 billion in April).
In May, German investors exercised markedrestraint in their purchases of foreign secur-ities ( 314.6 billion, compared with 321.9 bil-
lion in April). In particular, their buying of for-eign shares ( 31.1 billion) decreased greatlycompared with the previous month ( 39.5 bil-
lion). Net capital imports in the field of secur-ities transactions accordingly totalled 328.4
billion in May, compared with net capital ex-ports amounting to 327.4 billion a month
before.
In May, enterprises raised on balance 34.9
billion abroad through statistically recordedunsecuritised credit transactions. Foreigntransactions by public authorities led to in-flows of 31.8 billion net. The German bank-
ing system, whose accounts reflect, as itwere, all remaining external payments, tookin foreign funds amounting to 315.3 billion
net in May. For example, 315.9 billion net ac-
crued to German credit institutions in themonth under review, while the net externalposition of the Bundesbank (excluding theforeign reserves) rose by 30.6 billion. Of par-

15Cross-border capital
movementsandthe role of the Inter-national MonetaryFundThe liberalisation of international cap-
ital movements has made distinct pro-gress in the past few decades. It hasevolved in spurts, though, and hassometimes been limited to certain re-gions, individual countries or groupsof countries. In addition, the liberalisa-tion process has not been without itssetbacks, and the measures were oftencontroversial. Proponents of capital ac-count liberalisation emphasise the con-tribution it makes to allocating theworld’s resources towards their mostproductive uses, thereby fuellinggrowth. By contrast, critics note thepotentially destabilising impact of un-controlled capital flows. What manyfail to realise, however, is that in mostcases economic policy mistakes arewhat engender crises. Therefore, na-tional economic policies and financialsystems need to be strengthened, andpreparations should be made so thatcapital accounts can be opened upgradually. This is an area in which theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) isequipped to play an important rolewithin the framework of its macroeco-nomic surveillance and policy advice. Adesirable alternative over the longerrun, however, would be for the IMFtohave a more comprehensive mandate.The IMF, by analogy with its powers inthe framework of liberalising currentaccount transactions, should be givena clear mandate to ensure the orderlyliberalisation of capital account trans-actions.

16International capital movements
between controls and liberalisation
At the Bretton WoodsConference in 1944,
the IMF was assigned the task of promotingand monitoring an open, stable internationalmonetary system. A key element of this mon-etary system is the obligation of membercountries to liberalise current account trans-actionsand to eliminate exis ting foreign ex-change restrictions. However, the IMF’s Art-iclesof Agreement do not contain any s imilarobligation to liberalise capital transactions. In-stead, it is basically at the discretion of mem-ber countriesto either maintain res trictionsthey consider necessary or even to introducenew capital controls. Moreover, in some cir-cumstances (say, to safeguard its financialresources in the event of a looming large orsustained outflow of capital from a borrowercountry) the IMF may itself demand thatcapital controlsbe impos ed. The unequaltreatment of current account and capitaltransactions in the IMF’s Articles is a reflectionof an attitude which waswides pread astheIMF was established, namely that growth andemployment-promoting effectswere likely tobe created by cross-border transactions ingoods and services, in particular, and that un-controlled capital movementsin an environ-ment of fixed exchange rateswould tend tobe disruptive. The preference for fixed ex-change rates and scepticism regarding unre-stricted capital flows were rooted in, amongother things, the negative experiences thosecountrieshad had with devaluation racesandthe concomitant massive capital speculationin the period between the two world wars. Inthe fifties and early sixties, the internationalmonetary system, which was based on fixed
exchange ratesand tight controlsover capitalflows, continued to function largely withoutfriction. Monetary policy stability, expandingworld trade and increasing prosperity duringthat period offered little reason to call theexisting institutional rules into question.
As the sixties progressed, however, the Bret-
ton Woods parity system came under in-creasing pressure. Rising tension caused bydiverging preferencesamong IMF membercountriesin economic and particularly anti-inflationary policy, attendant disparity in de-velopment, and the gradual disappearance ofparities’ credibility, all conspired to unleashphases of torrential outflows of foreign cur-rency and wavesof s peculation. In 1973, theyultimately led to the breakdown of the Bret-ton Woods system of fixed exchange rates.No longer needing to stabilise the parity sys-tem through capital controls, yet also drivenby market forcesand the attendant competi-tive pressure, the industrial countries, in par-ticular, began to gradually eliminate capitalcontrols. International capital flows unstop-pably became more and more a key featureof the world economy; thiswasaccompaniedby the increasing use of innovative financialinstruments, and in many cases existing con-trols were circumvented. Cross-border capitaltransactions, whose cause was also aided byadvancesin information and communica-tionstechnology, recorded virtually explos ivegrowth in the nineties. It became increasinglyclear that government regulation could notlastingly stifle the economic motives andmechanisms behind the capital flows. More-over, it wasbecoming more and more obvi-

17ousthat capital movementscould not be
excluded from the process of deregulationwhich wasbeing pus hed in many countriesand from the increasing interrelationships inthe world economy.
In the beginning, growth of cross-border cap-
ital movementswasconcentrated on the in-dustrial countries. In these countries, capitalimports for direct investment purposes rosenearly thirtyfold between the mid-seventiesand the end of the nineties. Inflows for port-folio investments even went up nearly fifty-fold. In the nineties, private capital flowsto developing countriess kyrocketed aswell.Dynamic growth, and with it the hopesofattractive earnings, unleashed a strong rippleeffect. In some cases, government privatisa-tion programmesoffered favourable oppor-tunitiesfor international inves torsto entertheir markets. New direct investment in thedeveloping countries, according to IMF data,went up more than fivefold, from just underUS$ 40 billion asan annual average of the1989–1992 period to just over US$ 200 bil-lion in the 1997–1999 period. At the sametime, inflowsof portfolio inves tment pickedup from just over US$ 27 billion to US$ 104billion. Private capital hasnow become thedominant source of funding for an increasingnumber of developing countriesand emer-ging economies.
The phenomenon of large cross-border cap-
ital flows, however, did not originate in theclosing years of the twentieth century. In thepre-WWI economic boom, net capital exportsof the then-leading industrial countries – as apercentage of GDP – were at timesevenThe IMF’s Articles of Agreement,
current and capital transactions
The key passage in the IMF’s Articles of Agreement
governing capital transaction controls is containedin Article VI, section 3:
Controls of capital transfersMembers may exercise such controls as are ne-
cessary to regulate international capital move-ments, but no member may exercise these con-trols in a manner which will restrict paymentsfor current transactions. ...
This liberalisation requirement for current account
transactions explicitly covers payment for suchtransactions, not the transactions themselves. Theliberalisation of trade in goods and services is gov-erned by other agreements (GATT, WTO). The ideabehind this IMFrule is to ensure that in the case ofpermissible imports and exports (of goods and ser-vices) payments are permissible, too. Naturally, pay-ments for current account transactions always affectitems of the financial account (e.g. “claims onbanks”). To that extent, the required liberalisationof current account transactions alsoimplies freedomof financial operations. At the same time, (positiveor negative) current account balances, and in thatsense the transfer of savings, would be permissible.
Permission to regulate capital transactions under
the Articles of Agreement covers “pure” capitalmovements where entry and counterentry exclu-sively affect capital and asset items, such as the pur-chase ofsecurities,direct investment,orthedeposit-ing of short-term funds. The current account is notaffected by any of this. Instead, the liberalisation ofcapital movements has more to do with the cross-border supply of and demand for a variety of finan-cial items in the individual markets. Accordingly, thecomplete liberalisation of capital account transac-tions might have the following effects: bank bal-ances obtained in current account transactionsmight be used for direct investment; short-termliabilities might be replaced by longer-term bondissues; or, simply, pure futures transactions might beconcluded, in order to hedge subsequent trans-actions. All those types of transactions would helpdirect capital towards its most productive uses andwould therefore probably have an optimising reper-cussion on current account balances.

18higher than in modern times. The reason lay
in a massive transfer of resources from Euro-pean countries, in particular, to the youngerindustrial countries and to what were thennon-self-governing territories. By contrast,the character of capital movementshasundergone considerable change since then.The spectrum of financial instruments beingtraded isnowadaysmuch larger than inthe past. In the past few decades, growth ofinternational capital movementshasbeen fed
by institutional investors in particular.
The liberalisation of capital movements over
the past decades often took place in spurts; inmany cases it was limited to certain regions,individual countries, or groups of countries. Inaddition, the process of liberalisation sufferedoccasional setbacks and was often the subjectof controversy. The first attempts at liberalisa-tion took place in the fifties; the processgathered momentum when, in 1961, theOECD adopted the Code of Liberalisa-tion of Capital Movements. However, capitalmovementsin many indus trial countriesini-tially remained subject to a large number ofcontrolsaswell asins titutional, legal and taxhurdles. When the European Monetary Sys-tem was introduced in the late seventies,the liberalisation of capital movements inEurope distinctly gained momentum. The Sin-gle European Act, adopted in 1987, envisagedan unrestricted domestic market, includingliberalised capital movements. The MaastrichtTreaty basically deregulated capital flows in1994, both within the European Union andvis-M$ppb-vis non-EU countries. However, the pro-cess of liberalisation in Europe has occasional-ly stalled. For instance, in reaction to the EMScrises of 1992-93, controls were temporarilyreintroduced in some countries. That episodelikewise made it clear that the coexistence ofunrestricted capital flows and fixed exchangerates is generally only sustainable in thosecases where the countries in question are con-sistent in terms of macroeconomic, and espe-cially monetary, stabilisation; i.e., there shouldnot be any sustained discrepancies in the ratesof inflation (“synchronised stability”).

19All in all, the process of liberalisation of cap-
ital movementsin the indus trial countrieshasby no meansbeen completed. According tothe IMF, 20 out of 29 industrial countriesunder review still had restrictions on directinvestment in force at the end of 1999. Inmany of those cases, the main motive is likelyto be keeping foreign investors away fromenterprises having strategic or other eminentnational importance or which are sensitivein termsof national s ecurity. In addition,14 industrial countries have restricted non-residents’ rights to purchase real estate. Atthis juncture it would be fruitless to discusswhether it is even necessary or realistic toremove all barriers in those areas.
Germany isone of the few countriesthat at
an early stage already introduced the policyof freedom of capital transactions with for-eign countries.
1Asearly asthe end of 1958
the D-Mark became freely convertible, thusvirtually ending all restrictions on capital ex-ports. However, it was not yet possible to doentirely without controlsof capital importsatthe time. In the Bretton Woods fixed-rate sys-tem, the unrestricted inflow of foreign fundsalwaysharboured the danger of the Bundes -bank being forced to provide the Germaneconomy with more liquidity than wasadvis -able from a stability policy standpoint. Ad-ministrative attempts to stem the inflowof foreign exchange, such as requiring non-residents to obtain approval prior to purchas-ing domestic bonds and money market in-struments, banning interest on foreigners’deposits with German banks, and institutinga cash deposit requirement for borrowingabroad, ended up not being particularly suc-cessful. The transition to largely flexible ex-
change ratesand the abolition of the require-ment to purchase dollars in March 1973pushed capital inflows as the problem of anindependent monetary policy into the back-ground. The remaining restrictions on capitalimportsin Germany had been largely elimin-ated by 1981. At the end of 1999, Germanywasone of the few countriesnot having cap-ital controlsin any of the IMF’scategoriesunder review. That notwithstanding, the par-ties to such transactions must continue tocomply with numerousregulationsunder cor-porate law, financial supervisory law and taxlaw; however, these regulations apply gener-ally and cannot be regarded ass pecial capitalcontrols.
In the developing countries, too, the liberal-
isation of capital movements has not alwaysbeen smooth, nor has it always been withoutsetbacks. For instance, during the debt crisisat the beginning of the eighties, Latin Amer-ica witnessed a pronounced rise in capitalcontrols. As the eighties came to a close, andmore so when the nineties were ushered in,the trend towardsintegration of national fi-nancial systems into international financialmarketsbegan to accelerate among develop-ing and transition countries. The adjustmentof exchange-rate regimesto greater capitalmobility in those countries was not even.However, a certain trend towardsa “bi-polar” system of either fixed or flexible ex-change ratesisvis ible. A number of countrieshave chosen to peg their currencies fairly

what isknown asa “currency board”. How-ever, many emerging economies, traumatisedby their experience with the currency crises inthe nineties, have chosen an exchange-rateregime affording greater flexibility for ex-change rates. Despite all that, in the develop-ing countries there is still considerable poten-tial for further steps towards liberalising cap-ital movements. According to IMF data, atthe end of 1999 various barriers to cross-border capital transactions were still in placein most of the 129 developing countriesunder review. Direct investment, which is im-portant for the development process, has alsobeen particularly affected; in 106 of thecountries being studied, there are restrictionson direct investment.
International capital movements –
an engine of world economic growth
The central argument in favour of unrestrict-
ed international capital movementsliesintheir contribution to economic growth. In anenvironment of unfettered capital move-ments, national borders no longer stand inthe way of the efficient allocation of savings,and thusof “capital” asa factor of produc-tion. Available financial resources are trans-ferred to their most productive uses, i.e.where they promise the highest gains,thereby making the greatest contribution togrowth. Enterprises which invest can take re-course to savings held abroad, and investorscan go after those investment vehicles world-wide which match their desired combinationof risk and return.

transfers of savings abroad benefit from theinteraction of internationally active capitalsuppliers and demanders.
The welfare-enhancing effect of the free ex-
change of capital and assets is ultimately simi-lar to international trade in goodsand s er-vices. However, although the benefits of freetrade in goods are for the most part easilyunderstood, there is often difficulty regardingcapital transactions. That may be becausethese are not only cross-border flows but alsostocks. Yet this is where the actual benefitlies. Stock-holding is the vehicle driving inter-temporal substitution. Over time some econ-omies, owing to differences in structural fea-tures, develop different needs for financing,thus causing consumption and saving pat-ternsto diverge. For ins tance, developingcountriesand emerging economies , in theprocess of economic recovery, need a largervolume of financing for investment purposesthan can be raised through domestic savingand official development aid alone. For manyindustrial countries, unrestricted capital flowsalso open up the opportunity of taking ac-count of problemsrelating to unfavourabledemographic changes. During a period inwhich “baby boomers” are employed, sav-ingscan be formed abroad, the yieldsonwhich can be used at a later date. Globallyintegrated financial marketsens ure that thediverging financing and investment needs arebalanced out.
It isnot only at the macroeconomic level but
also in a sectoral view that unrestricted inter-national capital movementscan be expectedto yield benefits. Nationally operating finan-
cial services institutions which used to be pro-tected by national bordersmus t now dealwith intensified international pressure fromthe market and streamline their operatingproceduresif they want to remain competi-tive. Thisnot only favoursand acceleratestheprocess of innovation in the financial sector;the other sectors of the economy benefitfrom an efficient financial sector as well. Allthe same, there is no denying the fact thatthe increasing influence of foreign financialinstitutions in the domestic financial industryencounters scepticism and resistance in somecountries. However, in many cases there ishardly any alternative to the knowledgetransfer that goes hand in hand with directinvestment in the financial services sector (aswell as in other sectors). At the internationallevel, unrestricted capital flows help to realisebenefits from the advantages of specialisationin the financial sector. As in goods manufac-ture, it is not always possible or profitable fora country’s domestic institutions to providethe gamut of modern financial services. Inmany cases it is better to import selected fi-nancial services and to export other goodsand services, thus exploiting comparative ad-vantages. In the light of the accumulation ofrisk, however, the concentration which issometimes a corollary of the liberalisation ofcapital movementsisgroundsfor concern.Two thingsare important: cartel authoritiesmust remain on their guard, and the risks in-curred should be balanced out by an ad-equate “safety buffer” consisting of ownfunds (this is a matter for banking supervisorsto deal with).

22The positive effects of unrestricted capital
flowsexis t not only in theory. In fact, there issome empirical evidence. Developing coun-triesrelying mainly on private financingachieved much faster growth in the past twodecadesthan thos e countrieswhich relied pri-marily on official capital transfers. This correl-ation ismore marked during the ninetiesthanin the eighties. According to IMF data,
2net
debtor developing countriesrelying mainly onprivate financing grew at an annual averageof 6.1% in the 1992–2001 period, comparedwith 4.8% in the 1982–1991 period. By con-trast, developing countries relying mainly onofficial financing grew during the sameperiodsby only 3.7% and 2.7%, res pectively.The positive correlation between private cap-ital inflows and growth is also testimony tothe fact that countrieswith relatively healthystructures are more likely to attract inter-
national investment. Moreover, such invest-ment promotes cross-border transactions ingoods and services, thus addressing one ofthe main issues in the IMF’s Articles.
In addition to the positive welfare effects
described above, capital transactions in a re-gime of flexible exchange rateshave anotherentirely different benefit. Capital transactionscan be very effective in supporting monetarypolicy. In the seventies, particularly Germany’smonetary policy benefited from unrestrictedcapital flows, after having been put in anawkward situation in the sixties owing to itsstability-oriented stance in an environment offixed exchange rates. Given unrestricted cap-ital flowsand flexible exchange rates , experi-ence hass hown that monetary policy takeseffect relatively quickly. When interest ratesare raised, for instance, this triggers a trendtowardscapital importsand currency appreci-ation. That curbsexportsand s timulatesim-ports, thereby increasing the domestic supplyof goods, which in itself already has a damp-ening effect on prices. In addition, the dir-ect price correlation is used in a stability-enhancing manner. The trend towardscur-rency appreciation that goeshand in handwith capital imports puts downward pressureon import and export pricesand thushasadirect dampening impact on domestic prices.Unrestricted capital movements, which areinherently also sensitive to interest-ratechanges, and flexible exchange ratesstrengthen monetary policy over the longerrun, too.

Liberalisation – a cause offinancial crises?
The financial crises of the nineties dampened
the high expectationsof liberalis ed capitalmarkets at least in part. Suspicion becamerife that the substantial risks inherent in open-ing domestic capital markets (too quickly)might have been underestimated. The factthat dynamic economieswith s eeminglysound macro policies (but mostly fixed ex-change rates) encountered severe crises wasseen by many as a sign that international fi-nancial marketshad failed. The highly volatilenature of short-term capital flows bore thebrunt of criticism. The fact that it was pos-sible for crises to be transmitted to othercountrieswhich were apparently healthy wasseen as being especially problematic. How-ever, one issue is often overlooked: implicitloan and exchange rate guarantees, weakand undersupervised financial systems andpolitical interference in the economy, toname a few factors, were what created theincentive for excessive capital inflows in thefirst place. In addition, imported capital waschannelled to a considerable extent into pro-jectswhich had no chance of meeting profitexpectations, especially once implicit guaran-tees were eliminated. The Asian crisis was avivid example of the interplay of those fac-
tors. Owing to the close links in some ofthose countries between domestic financialintermediariesand their governments , for-eign lenders assumed in many cases that theirloanswere de facto officially guaranteed.Strong official support for a policy of stableexchange ratesals o contributed to foreignexchange risks of international lending busi-ness being underestimated. The govern-ments’ implied guarantees, given the under-supervised financial markets in many coun-tries, led to the creation of a sizeable volumeof foreign debt denominated in foreign cur-rency – which wasextremely s hort-term toboot. A large volume of capital importsfoundtheir way into the real estate sector, creatinga price bubble, or were intentionally chan-nelled through government influence intocertain sectors of the economy, leading tooverinvestment. Once financial markets real-ised that their assets were not matched bysufficiently productive investment, theybegan to withdraw their funds, which putmassive pressure on domestic currencies andultimately caused the currency crisis to breakout.
Prior to and during the crises, market partici-
pants also made some bad calls and over-reacted to other events. Incomplete or no ac-count wasoften taken of political and s truc-tural deficitswhen deciding on whether tolend to the countriesin ques tion. In manycases, market players engaged in herding be-haviour. Moreover, marketsat timestook aninsufficiently differentiated view of the vary-ing risk situations in individual countries.Thus, the outbreak of crises also placed pres-

the same group of countries or region as thecrisis countries but which did not necessarilyhave similar economic or structural weak-nesses. However, such misguided assess-mentswere corrected relatively quickly. At allevents, there is no record of contagion effectscausing severe crises in countries with soundeconomies. Therefore, although unrestrictedcapital movementsare capable of amplifyingand accelerating crises, the root causes are lo-cated elsewhere. In 1999 the Bundesbank, ina detailed study of the most recent inter-national financial crises, used econometricapproachesto come to the conclus ion thatbad economic policy wasparticularly atfault.

Areturn to regulated capitalmovements?
Irrespective of the longer-term advantages
associated with unrestricted capital mobility,and in the light of recent international finan-cial crises, time and again there are calls for areturn to regulation of cross-border capitalmovements. Such demands are often born ofthe opinion that unrestricted capital mobilitycurtailsautonomy in economic policy. In par-ticular, proponentsof thisopinion feel that ina system of fixed exchange rates, there wouldbe very little leeway for interest rate policy-makersto purs ue independent policy goalsregarding stability, employment or growth.One motive for maintaining or reintroducingUS$ billion

In making foreign exchangetransactions more expensive, thus reducingthe profitability of speculation, this tax is de-signed to reduce the incentive to indulge inshort-term foreign currency speculation,thereby limiting the volatility of exchangerates and avoiding destabilising effects on thedomestic banking system and the domesticeconomy. However, short-term capital trans-actions cannot be classified as undesirable ordismissed as economically dubious specula-tion out of hand. Certain short-term capitalmovements, such as arbitrage transactions,are, in fact, an integral element of efficientfinancial markets. In addition, trade credits,another form of short-term capital move-ments, play an important role in financingcurrent account transactions and help expand
world trade. A general limitation of short-term capital transactions would therefore im-pair the optimal deployment of available re-sources and could engender considerableeconomic costs in the form of growth losses.Besides, it would be difficult, maybe even im-possible, to introduce such a tax on a globalscale and to record all relevant foreign cur-rency transactions. In addition, experiencehass hown that controlscan become ineffect-ive very quickly over time because marketparticipants tend to shift their transactions tonon-regulated areasus ing non-regulated in-struments. If controls are then expanded fur-ther, their distortionary effects and the com-mensurate welfare losses increase.
In many cases, the demand for maintaining
or reintroducing capital controlsisvoiced bythose who want the advantages of capitalmobility without having to accept the marketdiscipline which this entails. Integration intointernational financial marketsinvolveslos inga certain degree of autonomy in forming eco-nomic policy. International capital flowsarerelatively sensitive to economic policy mis-takes. Capital outflows are often a sign thatfinancial marketshave little confidence in thewill and the ability of policymakersto under-take the necessary reforms and to make themsuccessful. However, it would be wrong toconclude that capital mobility underminespolicy freedom or imposes a policy strait-jacket. What capital mobility doesisto ex-pose existing policymaking deficits and thecosts they entail, thus putting pressure on theresponsible policymakers to explain their ac-tions. It is true that policy mistakes make ad-

26justment inevitable sooner or later, even in an
environment of restricted capital mobility.However, in a system of free capital mobility,such deficits are more difficult to conceal,and adjustment pressure ensues more rapidlyand with greater force. It comesasno s ur-prise, therefore, that criticism of free capitalmobility and callsfor the introduction of cap-ital controls are always loud in those situ-ationswhere economic policy mis takesare re-vealed and policymakersare forced to realis ethat they are ultimately not above the lawsofeconomics and their incentive mechanisms. Itistherefore all the more important that thefunction of unrestricted capital mobility in im-posing economic policy discipline not be im-paired.
The need for an orderly process of
liberalisation
Even if the severe financial crises that oc-
curred in the ninetiesmight not have beenpossible without unrestricted capital move-ments, it still does not make sense to call fora reversal of liberalisation. Those who doignore the fact that such a reversal wouldlead to growth-related gainsbeing s urren-dered, and that the discipline imposed bymarketstendsto have more advantagesthandisadvantages in the long run. Therefore, thegoal must be to make use of the advantagesafforded by capital mobility while at the sametime reducing the probability and the extentof future financial crises. The solution lies inavoiding errorsin economic policy and instrengthening the underlying framework. Thecreation of an efficient banking supervisorystructure is a key element of such a solution.
At the same time, obstacles impairing marketeconomy steering mechanisms should be re-moved. Trade barriers, government guaran-tees, and rigid exchange-rate arrangementsall need to be reexamined. In most of thecountries hit by recent crises, there is stillmuch to be done in that regard. Finally, it isalso important that the international commu-nity avoid distorting incentive structures formarket participants. Therefore, the IMF andother public donorss hould not offer largefinancial assistance packages in the event offinancial crises. If the private sector is not suf-ficiently involved in the resolution of financialcrises, that will lay the basis for the misdirec-tion of capital and for later crises to occur.
In future, it will be particularly important to
create a sound institutional framework priorto liberalising capital movements. However,calling for an orderly sequencing does notmean that liberalising cross-border capitalmovementss hould only begin once the pro-cess of deregulating the domestic financialsector has been completed. Instead, theopening up of cross-border capital flows anddomestic reforms are linked together. Thereare no one-size-fits-all solutions, for all coun-triesare different in termsof their level ofmacroeconomic development, the “matur-ity” of their financial sector and their institu-tional structures. However, there are somegeneral principles which may serve to ensurethat capital account liberalisation is success-fully sequenced. In the case of long-term cap-ital flows, and especially direct investment,there isles sdanger of them being withdrawnquickly in the event of economic difficulties.

27Priority should be given to establishing a do-
mestic financial market and the commensur-ate institutions and supervisory bodies. Open-ing the market to short-term capital flows issomething which should be handled withcare. Therefore, thiss hould be done more to-wards the end of the liberalisation process.On the whole, the recent financial crisescould have been mitigated or even avoidedentirely, if a functioning supervisory structurehad been in place (for instance, regarding thehedging of short-term foreign currency liabil-ities).
On the road towardsliberalis ed capital
movements, capital controls may at bestact as a “temporary substitute” for still-underdeveloped supervisory and risk man-agement systems. In that context, referenceis often made to Chile’s success with its oftencited tax-like capital import restrictions. How-ever, it hasnot been conclus ively proven thatChile’seconomic s tability in the ninetieswasdue to the existence of those controls. Thereare many signs that the stability-orientedmacroeconomic policy (including the timelytransition to flexible exchange rates) andsound financial market supervision played akey role. Temporary restrictions on capitalmovementsmay als o be called for in excep-tional circumstances in order to give a countrysome breathing room to implement necessaryand confidence-building reform measures ina crisis situation. Panic-induced capital flightcan thusbe avoided. However, s uch controlsshould only be introduced as part of a com-prehensive programme of economic policy re-form which iss upported by both the countryin question and the IMF. Restrictions on cap-ital movementscannot take the place of the
necessary adjustment and reform measures.In addition, the controlss hould have a timelimit and should be explicitly advertised as anexceptional measure. That is the only way toavoid losing much of the confidence of inter-national investors and the commensuratelong-term loss of access to the capital market.In 1998 Malaysia introduced capital controlsaspart of a programme to res olve a financialcrisis – though without collaboration with theIMF. It isnot yet pos s ible to make a final pro-nouncement on the costs and benefits ofthose measures. However, initial analysesseem to indicate that the outcome of thosemeasures was better than many observershad originally expected. Capital outflowswere reduced for some time, thus giving thecountry the necessary breathing room to con-duct reforms. The price, though, was a rela-tively sharp rise in international financingcosts, with inflows of foreign direct invest-ment remaining sluggish. However, Malaysiadeserves some credit for having overcome thecrisis without massive official assistance.
The IMF’s role
The financial crises of the nineties demon-
strated that, given a great degree of capitalmobility, the effectsof bad economic policyand an insufficient framework can be muchmore serious than had been the case in thepast. Therefore, crisis prevention through in-tensified bilateral and multilateral IMF surveil-lance isof prime importance. In particular, de-ficienciesin member countries ’ economic pol-icies must be identified at an early stage. This

28includesmonitoring macroeconomic develop-
mentsand their core areasof monetary andfiscal policy, including the soundness of theexchange-rate regime. Rigid exchange-ratearrangementsin an environment of unfet-tered capital movementscan not only under-mine the goal of a stability-oriented monetarypolicy but can also contribute greatly toheightening the potential for a crisis to breakout. Macroeconomic indicators, though ableto give early warning of looming crises,cannot take the place of a comprehensivecountry-specific analysis. As part of its macro-economic surveillance and policy advice, theIMF should also intensify its reviews of the in-stitutional structures in member countries asto how capable they are of absorbing capitalinflowsand trans ferring them to productiveuses. In that context, an efficient and stablefinancial sector and an effective supervisoryauthority are especially important. The sameappliesto the multilateral s urveillance ofglobalised financial markets. The conveningof a “Capital MarketsCons ultative Group”by the IMF Managing Director asa forum fordialogue with private market playersand thefusion of capital market-relevant divisionswithin the IMF to form an independent Inter-national Capital MarketsDepartment canhelp enhance the Fund’sexpertis e in capitalmarket affairsand s trengthen itsmultilateralsurveillance function.
The quality of financial market players’ deci-
sions rests in particular on the extent towhich they are based on reliable informationon economic developmentsin the countriesin question. Inadequate or erroneous infor-mation causes capital allocation to be sub-optimal and, in crisis situation, may lead to
overreactions. It is primarily each investor’s in-dividual responsibility to properly assess theavailable information. The IMF can play a sup-porting role by promoting the provision ofmeaningful and timely information. In add-ition, an important instrument for improvingthe general level of transparency is the devel-opment of standards and codes for financialand economic activities. The IMF, whosemembership virtually spans the globe, is pre-destined to play a prominent role in the for-mulation and monitoring of important stand-ardsand codes . With its“Reportson the Ob-servance of Standards and Codes” (ROSCs), ithas a suitable instrument at its disposal. How-ever, there isalready a large and growingarray of standards and codes. Even compli-ance with the twelve standards defined bythe Financial Stability Forum isa very ambi-tiousproject. It istherefore imperative to s etprioritiesin termsof timing and content. Notevery standard is of equal importance to allcountriesin every s ituation. Moreover, adopt-ing more and more standards and wideningtheir scope does not as such guarantee astable financial system. Applying standardsand codes can support a sound macro policy,yet they are naturally not a substitute for it.
The IMF can also contribute to the necessary
financial sector reforms and to the establish-ment of a suitable regulatory frameworkthrough its technical assistance. Close co-operation and coordination with other na-tional and international institutions (especiallythe World Bank) is necessary in order to usescarce resources properly and in a results-oriented manner.

29Interim Committee Statement on Liberalization of Capital MovementsUnderan
Amendment of the IMF’s Articles, as Adopted, Hong Kong SAR, September21, 1997
1.ItistimetoaddanewchaptertotheBretton
Woods agreement. Private capital flows havebecome much more important to the inter-national monetary system, and an increasinglyopen and liberal system has proved to behighly beneficial to the world economy. By fa-cilitating the flow of savings to their most pro-ductive uses, capital movements increase in-vestment, growth, and prosperity. Provided it isintroduced in an orderly manner, and backedboth by adequate national policies and a solidmultilateral system for surveillance and finan-cial support, the liberalization of capital flowsis an essential element of an efficient inter-national monetary system in this age of global-ization. The IMF’s central role in the inter-national monetary system, and its near univer-sal membership, make it uniquely placed tohelp this process. The Committee sees the IMF’sproposed new mandate as bold in its vision,but requiring cautious implementation.
2. International capital flows are highly sensi-
tive to, among other things, the stability of theinternational monetary system, the quality ofmacroeconomic policies, and the soundness ofdomestic financial systems. The recent turmoilin financial markets has demonstrated againthe importance of underpinning liberalizationwith a broad range of structural measures,especially in the monetary and financial sector,and within the framework of a solid mix ofmacroeconomic and exchange rate policies.Particular importance will need to be attachedto establishing an environment conducive tothe efficient use of capital and to buildingsound financial systems solid enough to copewith fluctuations in capital flows. This phasedbut comprehensive approach will tailor capitalaccount liberalization to the circumstances ofindividual countries, thereby maximizing thechances of success, not only for each countrybut alsoforthe international monetary system.
3. These efforts should lead to the establish-
ment of a multilateral and nondiscriminatorysystem to promote the liberalization of capitalmovements. The IMFwill have the task of as-sisting in the establishment of such a systemand stands ready to support members’ efforts
in this regard. Its role is also key to the adop-tion of policies that would facilitate properlysequenced liberalization and reduce the likeli-hood of financial and balance of paymentscrises.
4. In light of the foregoing, the Committee in-
vites the Executive Board to complete its workon a proposed amendment of the Fund’s Art-icles that would make the liberalization of cap-ital movements one of the purposes of theFund and extend, as needed, the Fund’s juris-diction through the establishment of carefullydefined and uniformly applied obligations re-garding the liberalization of such movements.Safeguards and transitional arrangements arenecessary for the success of this major en-deavor. Flexible approval policies will have tobe adopted. In both the preparation of anamendment to the IMF’s Articles and its imple-mentation, the members’ obligations underother international agreements will be re-spected. In pursuing this work, the Committeeexpects the IMFand other institutions to co-operate closely.
5. Sound liberalization and expanded access to
capital markets should reduce the frequency ofrecourse to Fund resources and other excep-tional financing. Nevertheless, the Committeerecognizes that, in some circumstances, therecould be a large need for financing from theFund andother sources. TheFund willcontinueto play a critical role in helping to mobilize fi-nancial support for members’ adjustment pro-grams. In such endeavors, the Fund will con-tinue its central catalytic role while limitingmoralhazard.
6. In view of the importance of moving de-
cisively toward this new worldwide regime ofliberalized capital movements, and welcomingthe very broad consensus of the membershipon these basic guidelines, the Committee in-vites the Executive Board to give high priorityto the completion of the required amendmentofthe Fund’s Articles ofAgreement.

30cial support for the process of liberalisation is
neither justifiable nor necessary. IMF financialsupport is meant to cover a balance of pay-mentsneed aspart of an adjus tment pro-gramme and not merely to subsidise policyimprovements. An orderly and properly se-quenced liberalisation process should notentail the need for additional financing. Theuse of IMF funds as an incentive for orderlyliberalisation should be rejected as well. Notonly isit up to the countriesthems elvestocreate the regulatory framework for the liber-alisation of capital movements, but such in-dependent action isin each country’sownbest interest.
In the light of the increasing speed of inter-
national capital flowsand the benefitsof or-derly liberalisation, a debate was launched inthe mid-ninetiesasto whether, and if s o how,the IMF’sArticlesof Agreement s hould beadapted to fit those realities. The debate cul-minated in a statement issued in autumn1997 by the Interim Committee (now theInternational Monetary and Finance Commit-tee) inviting the IMF Executive Board to com-plete itswork on a propos ed amendment ofthe IMF’sArticlesthat would make the liberal-isation of capital movements one of theFund’s tasks (see text box on page 29). TheIMF’s jurisdiction should, where necessary, beextended by meansof carefully defined, uni-formly applied commitmentsto liberalis e cap-ital movements. That would end the asym-metrical treatment of current account trans-actionsand pure capital account trans actionsin the IMF’sArticles . Except for clearly definedsituations, the imposition of capital controlsby member countrieswould be prohibited
from then on, asa matter of principle.
Such an amendment of the IMF’sArticles
would give a clear legal basis to the Fund’s ac-tivitiesand would enable a dis tinct delinea-tion to be made between itsrole and that ofother international institutions. It would alsoensure that all member countries are equallycommitted to liberalising capital movements.However, asa cons equence of the recentfinancial crises, member countries’ supportfor a comprehensive IMF mandate in the lib-eralisation of capital movements has beenwaning distinctly as of late. Since it does notseem possible at present to find a majority infavour of extensively amending the IMF’s Art-icles, the possibility of the Fund having a lessfar-reaching role has already been discussedas a sort of second-best solution. In this scen-ario, the liberalisation of capital movementscould be included in the Articlesasa purpos eof the Fund, but it would be at the discretionof member countriesto decide on the timing,extent and pace of the process of liberal-isation. Only the reintroduction of controlswould require IMF approval. Although thisapproach would not go asfar asgiving theIMF comprehensive jurisdiction in the liberal-isation of capital movements, it would still bea step in the right direction compared withthe existing legal situation. Over the longerrun, there isprobably no alternative toamending the IMF’sArticlesof Agreement insuch a manner as to take due account of theeconomic importance of unrestricted capitalmobility and to eliminate the present asym-metry in the treatment of current accountand capital account transactions.

31Real interest rates:
movements anddeterminantsThe real interest rate is an important
determinant of the saving and invest-ment behaviour of households and en-terprises and therefore of key import-ance in terms of cyclical developmentand long-term economic growth. Itis therefore vitally important to askwhether the real interest rate level isappropriate and how, if necessary, itcan be influenced. Measuring realinterest rates is, however, associatedwith a number of problems as the in-flation expected during the investmentperiod cannot be observed directly.Nonetheless, real interest rates containimportant information about invest-ment conditions in the capital marketand the economy’s financing terms.This can be seen from an analysis ofreal interest rate movements over thepast 40 years. An attempt by the cen-tral bank to control real interest ratesgives rise to a number of problems andmust ultimately be rejected. Monetarypolicy has a direct effect only on theshort end of the interest rate spectrum.The attempt to use an expansionarymonetary policy to drive long-termreal interest rates below their equilib-rium value would merely lead, in themedium term, to price increases whichwould, in turn, be reflected in a higherinflation risk premium and thereforein higher capital costs.

32Introduction
Interest is the price paid for the temporary
provision of funding. In a state of equilibriumit aligns supply (“saving”) and demand (“in-vestment”) on the capital market. The savingand investment behaviour of households andenterprisesisakeyfactorforbothcyclicalde-velopment and long-term growth. Therefore,whether the current interest rate level is ap-propriate and how, if necessary, it can be in-fluenced are questions which assume majorimportance – not least with regard to monet-ary policy. The Bundesbank has thereforedocumented and analysed long-term interestrate movements on the German capital mar-ket in a series of articles, in which the focuswas on nominal interest rates.
1By contrast,
this article deals primarily with real interestratesandcoversalongerperiodoftime.
In a monetary economy in which money is
the unit of measurement for all prices, it isnot only important how many monetaryunits are obtained in return for forgoing im-mediate access to goods (“saving”), but alsohow many goods those units will be able tobuy in the future; much the same applies toinvestment. Hence the money interest ornominal interest is adjusted to take accountof the price changes which occur during theobservation period and savingand invest-ment decisions are based on the real interestrate. Analyses of real and nominal interestrates yield similar results only when the rateofinflationisstableandlow.Theuseofnom-inal rather than real interest rates can lead towrongdecisions, particularly over long erperiods.In contrast to nominal interest rates, price
changes which occur during the time frameof a financial investment or a real investmentcan only be observed retrospectively. Ratherthan the real interest rate which is actuallyrealised, economic agents can therefore onlyuse the anticipated real interest rate as ayardstick for their savingor investment deci-sions.
2In the economics literature, reference
is made in this connection to the “ ex ante

33Empirical evidence of the validity of the Fisher parity
An econometric analysis of the link between the nominal
interest rate and the rate of inflation is presented here.This connection is closely associated with the name of Irv-ing Fisher, who, in 1930, elaborated the hypothesis whichbears his name on the adjustment of the nominal interestrate to the inflation rate. According to the Fisher hypoth-esis, a 1% increase in the expected rate of inflation leadsto a 1% increase in the nominal interest rate. In reality, al-though there is a marked connection between the nominalinterest rate and the inflation rate, it is not necessarilyone-to-one as in the Fisher hypothesis. The Fisher hypoth-esis could, however, apply in the long term and corres-ponds in this interpretation to a cointegration relation-ship. If the nominal interest rate and the rate of inflationare cointegrated, this does not imply that the real interestrate is constant (as originally assumed by Fisher) but ratherthat it is stationary, i.e. a long-term stable real interestrate.
The above table summarises all the results of a test for co-
integration of the three-month money market rate andthe rate of inflation. The hypothesis that there is no cointe-gration can be rejected at the 5% and 1% levels,
1although,
by contrast, there can be no rejection of the hypothesisthat there is at most one cointegration relationship. Thetest therefore explicitly shows that there is one cointegra-tion relationship between the rate of inflation and thenominal interest rate, thus confirming the Fisher hypoth-esis. It is then interesting to ask whether the long-term
connection between the nominal interest rate and the in-flation rate is a one-to-one relationship. The directiontaken by the adjustment to the long-term equilibrium be-tween the nominal interest rate and the inflation rate isalso important. Answers to these two questions can be ob-tained with the aid of an error correction model for thenominal interest rate (i) and inflation rate ( p) variables as
in the following equations.
Di
t=ar(pt–1–bit–1)+er, t
Dpt=ap(pt–1–bit–1)+ep,t
On the right-hand side of these equations are further
lagged variables such as Dit–1,Dpt–1,Dit–2,Dpt–2, and so on.
However, for the purpose of simplification, these are notwritten out in detail. In these equations the parameter b
describes the long-term connection between the nominalinterest rate and the inflation rate and the parameters a
r
and apdescribe the short-term adjustment to deviations
from the equilibrium. The table below reproduces the re-sults of a test for binding restrictions.
The restriction b= 1 implies that a 1% increase in the rate
of inflation will lead over the long term to a 1% increasein the nominal interest rate, whereas the restriction a
p=0
implies that the rate of inflation does not adjust to theequilibrium position. Neither restriction can be rejected.

The nominal interest rate can be clearly seen to react tothe rate of inflation.

34rate for the period in question.3The Fisher
parity is based, however, on restrictive as-sumptions.Forinstance,taxaspectsareomit-ted, although, in practice, their role is notnegligible. In addition, it is assumed that in-vestors are indifferent as to whether their in-vestment is nominal or real, as longas theyield differential is in line with the expectedinflation. The uncertainty surroundingthe in-flation forecast is assumed, however, not toplay arole. In fact, therearesigns that invest-ors ensure that they are compensated forrunningtheriskofactualinflationnotmatch-ingexpectations by means of a mark-up ofthe rate of return. “Inflation risk premia” ofthis kind also seem to fluctuate over time,
4
thus also relaxingthe connection betweenreal and nominal rates over the short term.Over longer time horizons, nominal interestrates and the rate of inflation move in par-allel, with the result that, from a statisticalpoint of view, the Fisher parity cannot be re-jected (see the box on page 33). The condi-tions enablingnominal interest rates to bebroken down into a real interest rate and in-flation expectations are thus met at leastmoreorless.
In an economy without inflation-indexed
bonds(seetheadjacentbox),alongsidenomin-alinterestrates,informationabouttheinflationInflation-indexed bonds
In recent years index-linked bonds with the
amount repayable and the interest rates linked to
general price movements have been issued evenoutside the circle of high-inflation countries. In
the euro area, France has been issuing inflation-
indexed bonds (OATis) with ten or thirty-year
maturities since September 1998; the interest rate
on these bonds and the amount repayable are tied
to the development of the French consumer price
index (excluding tobacco).
 1
The interest rate paid on OATis, however, does
not correspond fully to the real interest rate, as,
for practical reasons, the inflation adjustment
takes place with a lag of three months. A
comparison with nominal bonds with the same
maturity enables implied inflation rates, known as
break-even inflation rates, to be calculated. When
evaluating these indicators, it should, however, be
noted that the yield of OATis contains a liquidity
premium, as the market for index-linked bonds isfar less liquid than that for conventional
government paper. The chart below shows that
this problem was particularly marked in the
months immediately following the launch of
OATis. Thereafter the real interest rates on
index-linked bonds and those based on surveys
were very similar.  
1In accordance with section 3 of the Currency Act
(Währungsgesetz) , index-linking was prohibited in Ger-
many prior to the start of European monetary union;
the follow-up regulation governing prices no longer
applies to the money and capital market.

35expectations of market players is needed to
calculate the future real interest rate which isrelevant in terms of macroeconomic develop-ments.Forshort-terminterestrates,itisusuallyenough to extrapolate the current inflationrate into the future. For example, the most re-cently measured rate of inflation is deductedfrom the interest rate on three-month funds. Ifapplied to long-term interest rates, such a pro-cedure can be misleadingsince it is implicitlyassumed that in the years ahead priceswill de-v e l o pe x a c t l ya st h e yd i di nt h ep a s tt w e l v emonths. As, for instance, the rate of inflationfluctuates in the course of economic activity,thisisnotgenerallythecase.
If anex antereal interest rate is to be deter-
mined for a longer residual maturity (e.g. sev-eral years), information about inflation expect-ations for that period of time must be avail-able. These inflation expectations can be de-rivedfromsurveys. Since autumn1989,for ex-ample, the London-based firm Consensus Eco-nomics has determined expectations of pricedevelopments from surveys of specialists.
5Al-
ternatively, inflation expectations can be esti-mated usingeconometric procedures. Thesecan either take account of a number of ex-planatory variables or model the dependentvariable solely from its own history. In practice,the forecastingproperties of multivariate pro-cedures are often no better than those of sim-pler models. Hence we estimate inflation ex-pectations usinga univariate ARIMA approach(see the box on page 36). This allows us toobserve the period before autumn 1989, forwhich no survey results are yet available.

6Usingthetimeser-
ies model to calculate the ex antereal interest
rate would therefore appear justified. Only atthe start of phases of rapidly risingprices(suchas in the wake of the two oil price shocks inthe 1970s) or of disinflation (such as the mid-1990s)is it to be presumed that there will be adownward or upward distortion of the infla-tionexpectations.
Irrespective of whether inflation expectations
are derived from surveys or whether they areestimated, when calculatingreal interestrates,thematurityandtypeoftheunderlyingnominal interest rate as well as the choice ofprice index become relevant issues. Analysesofrealinterestratesareonlyusefulifthetimehorizon for those interest rates covers thewhole investment period. In the case of cap-ital projects this is usually several years, forsavings decisions it might even amount todecades (for example, for pension provision).Real interest rates for shorter maturities arenot very informative in this respect, unless as-sumptions are made about price and interestrate movements in the subsequent periods.Aswellasthematurity,thechoiceofaspecif-

6For example, the ARIMA model did not foresee the
surge in prices in the lead-up to German unification,
while the institutions surveyed expected inflation to per-
sist for an extended period of time. As a result, inflation
rates in the first half of the 1990s were clearly below the
Consensus Forecast, even if they were above the fore-
casts of the time series model. In the middle of the dec-
ade the opposite occurred. The survey results showed
lower inflation expectations than the econometric calcu-
lations.Inflation

36ic nominal interest rate and of a price index is
dependent on the issue beinganalysed pre-cisely. For macroeconomic analyses, a capitalmarketrateandtheconsumerpriceindexaregenerally used.
7There are sound economic
reasons for this. The yield on debt securitiesoutstandingcorresponds to the opportunitycosts of a financial or real investment, even ifthe actual financing costs are generally high-er. The bank rates relevant to the financingalso tend to run parallel to the capital marketrates. The consumer price index represents afairapproximationoftheoverallpricelevel.Inaddition, capital market rates and the con-sumer price index are available with only ashorttimelag.
Real interest rates in theory and in
monetary policy practice
In order to assess whether the interest rate
level is in keepingwith the macroeconomicenvironment, the concept of a “neutral” or“equilibrium” real interest rate can be ap-plied. This rate reflects economic growth thatis consistent with potential output withoutpressure beingput on prices. Deviations ofthe actual interest rate from the neutral realinterest rate therefore signal imbalances,which are ultimately reflected in an overheat-ARIMA method of determining the
real interest rate
The rates of inflation were obtained with the aid of the
consumer price index. Up to 1992 this index refers towestern Germany and from 1993 to the whole of Ger-many. The time series for the short-term interest ratewas derived from the money market rates reported byFrankfurt banks (up to 1990), Fibor (up to the end of1998) and Euribor (from 1999), in each case for three-month funds. Up to 1973 the long-term interest rate isthe yield on all domestic debt securities outstandingand from 1974 the yield on all domestic debt securitiesoutstanding with a residual maturity of five to six years.These two series gradually coincided in 1973, making iteasy to form a long series. All data used are quarterlyfigures and have not been seasonally adjusted in orderto ensure that the analysis is not affected by the adjust-ment procedure.
The formation of expectations of future inflation was
modelled using the ARIMA approach.
1Plausible results
were yielded by an ARIMA(0,1,2) approach 2of the type
Dlog p t=q0+et+q1et–1+q2et–2
where Dlog p t=l o gp t–l o gp t–1is the change in the
logarithmic price level. The etare independent, identi-
cally distributed random variables. Starting with theperiod from 1955 to 1960, this ARIMA model was used,in each case for a period of five years, to forecast thedevelopment of inflation over the next five years (or,more precisely, 5
13P)–2years). The estimation and forecast-
ing period was thus successively shifted forward (five-year window). This procedure guarantees that only cur-rent and historical data are taken into account for theinflation forecast. However, it is flexible enough to takeaccount of structural changes.

1Within the framework of an ARIMA (autoregressive
integrated moving average) approach, the develop-ment of a non-stationary variable is reproduced usingits lagged values and past forecasting errors. An intro-duction to the modelling and forecasts of ARIMAmodels is given in chapter 2 of Mills, T. (1999), TheEconometrics of Financial Time Series, Cambridge. —2The inclusion of autoregressive terms led to very errat-
ic and implausible inflation forecasts. — 3On a very
similar procedure which also works with a five-year win-dow, see Juntilla, J. (2001), Structural breaks, ARIMAmodel and Finnish inflation forecasts, in InternationalJournal of Forecasting, Vol. 17, p. 203–230.

world of flexible prices and rational expect-ations, the actual and neutral real interestrates coincide.
9Differences between the two
values occur if, because of price rigidities orexpectations which are based on incompleteor wrongly processed information, prices arenot fully aligned with the real economic cir-cumstances.
However, the individual models reach differ-
ent conclusions about the level and the prop-erties of the neutral real interest rate. In add-ition,whateconomictheoryhastosayrelatesto the yield rate of productive capital ratherthan to the real “monetary” interest rate,which is the subject of this article. The twotypes of real interest rates are related, how-ever, by arbitrage. The growth theory disre-gards short-term fluctuations in economic ac-tivity and generally assumes that the realinterest rate is constantly at the equilibriumposition. In accordance with the “modifiedgolden rule” of capital accumulation, it cor-responds, in a state of equilibrium, to thelong-term growth opportunities. These are inturn dependent on demographic growth andthe pace of technical progress – plus a timepreference factor which reflects households’willingness to delay consumption and thus tosave(seetheAnnexonpage46).

Business cycle theory, however, leaves asidelong-term determinants and focuses on themovement of real interest rates in the eco-nomic cycle. This is dependent on both thetypeandthedurationoftheimpulses.Theef-fects of a demand shock on the real interestrate differ from those of a supply shock. Theanalysis in the followingsection shows that
real interest rates can fluctuate markedly inthe course of the economic cycle. If thegrowth and business cycle theories are com-bined, what emerges is a picture of a neutralreal interest rate which fluctuates in the shortand medium term but which returns to itsaverage or standard value over the long run(seeAnnex).

8The concept of the neutral real interest rate is closely
related to Wicksell’s “natural” interest rate, which repre-
sents a kind of return on fixed assets. If the interest
(which roughly corresponds to the nominal capital mar-
ket rate) diverges from the natural interest rate, this
leads, accordingto Wicksell, to an adjustment of the
price level. This, in turn, exerts pressure on the interest,
which adjusts to the new circumstances. In the course of
a cumulative process, the interest draws nearer to the
naturalinterestrateuntil,inastateofequilibrium,nofur-
ther price changes occur. Wicksell’s concept of a natural
interest rate takes neither growth nor employment into
account. The realisation that there could be various nat-
uralinterest ratesfordifferentgrowthpathsandemploy-
ment levels caused Keynes, in his “General Theory”, to
develop the concept of the neutral interest rate, which
presupposes full employment. See Wicksell, K., Geldzins

38est rate – plays a relatively minor role.11On
the one hand, this has to do with the afore-mentioneddifficultiesofmeasuringrealinter-est rates. In addition, estimations of the neu-tralrealinterestrateareassociatedwithgreatuncertainty. In principle, two approaches arepossible. The first consists of estimatingtheparameters of a macroeconomic model, fromwhich the real interest rate is then calculated.The results are, however, strongly dependenton the exact specification of the underlyingmodel. In addition, it is difficult to determinethe statistical confidence intervals. Thesecondapproachdoesnotthereforeuseaco-herent model and attempts to estimate theneutral real interest rate from the long-termaverage of the real interest rates and thechanges in the assumed determinants. In thefollowingsection we take this second course,thereby limitingourselves to commentingonthebroadmovementoftheneutralrealinter-est rate, without giving precise informationabout its level. Because of taxation of theinterest received, it is difficult to implementthe concept of the real interest rate gap aswell. It drives a wedge between the grossinterest,whichthedebtorhastopay,andthenetinterestrate,which ispaidtothe creditor.However, the gap between net interest rates– to which considerations about the level ofthe neutral real interest rate refer – and thegross interest rate is likely to be relativelystableovertime.
Even if it were possible to identify a diver-
gence oftheactual andtheneutralrealinter-est rate, it needs to be asked – particularlyfrom the perspective of the central bank –whether and how the neutral rate can becontrolled in practice. The opportunities for
the central bank to exert an influence on thereal interest rate decrease as the interest ratelock-in period increases. By controllingthenominal money market rates, monetary pol-icy can indeed influence the real short-terminterest rate owing to a certain sluggishnessin the rate of inflation. Ultimately, however,the real interest rate is determined by realeconomic factors. Over the medium andlonger term, therefore, it can be assumedthat monetary policy measures are reflectedin the economic agents’ inflation expect-ationsandwillthusleadprimarilytoachangein the price level as well as in the nominalinterest rates. The effect of monetary policyon the real capital market rate thereforetends to be indirect, i.e. via the inflation riskpremium inherent in the real interest rate.This risk premium is particularly marked if therates of inflation are high and unstable. Inaddition, tax effects also play a role in termsof real interest rate movements.
12The central
bankcanonlyseektobringaboutareductionin the inflation risk premium by eliminatinginflation uncertainties as far as possible. Thisis an argument in favour of monetary policythat is clearly focused on the objective of sta-bility.
11At the start of the 1990s a special role was attributed
for a time to the (short-term) real interest rate in the
monetary policy strategy of the US Federal Reserve.
Moreover, some monetary policy rules – such as the Tay-
lor rule – are based on a concept of real interest rates
which, however, likewise takes account of the short end
of the financial market only. See Deutsche Bundesbank,
Taylor interest rate and Monetary Conditions Index,

estrates,fiscalpolicyisafarbetterbasisfromwhich to work. In contrast to monetary pol-icy, it has a direct impact on supply and de-mand on the capital market.
13The effective-
ness offiscal policyis confirmedby numerousempirical studies which regularly note a posi-tive correlation between the long-term levelof the real interest rate and the governmentdebtordeficit.
Real interest rate movements in Germany
Accordingto our estimations, in the past 40
years the expected real interest rate on theGerman capital market was, on average, 4%and the real money market rate just over2
3(6)T4% per annum (see the table on page 40).
The gap between the real rate of interest andthe relevant nominal rate was in both casesaround 3 percentage points, which corres-ponds to the average rate of inflation. Al-though real interest rates have fluctuatedwidely within the individual interest ratecycles, the average rates in the differentcycles are very similar.
14The expected long-
term real interest rate was at its lowest aver-age level – 3
1(6)T4% – in the period from 1994
and peaked, at just over 5%, in the preced-ingperiod (third quarter of 1986 to the firstquarter of 1994). The picture for the ex post
real interest rate is, however, somewhat dif-ferent; it reached its lowest point in the1970sandpeakedinthe1980s.
The relative long-term stability of real interest
rates was accompanied by marked fluctu-ations over shorter time frames (see thecharts on pages 41 and 42). This is in line
witheconomictheory,accordingtowhich,al-though the real interest rate varies over theeconomic cycle, it is determined in the longtermbyfactorswhichareslow tochange.Anexplanation needs to be found, however, forthe high volatility of the real interest rate asestimated usingan ARIMA model, comparedwith nominal interest rates. On the basis ofthe Fisher parity the nominal interest rateswouldnormallybeexpectedtofluctuatecon-siderably more widely. The far smaller volatil-ity of real interest rates derived from surveyspoints to the fact that the cause is to befound in the modellingof inflation expect-ations. The volatility of the real interest rate istherefore overstated in the ARIMA approachif “true” price expectations are accurately re-flectedbytheConsensusForecasts,whichareused as an alternative. Over longer time hori-zons, the econometric approach yields, how-ever, a good approximation of the survey re-sults. The evolution of the nominal and realmoney and capital market rates since thestart of the 1960s is detailed below andviewedagainstthebackgroundofthemacro-economic environment. The period before1961 is excluded from the analysis for tworeasons. First, we need a certain amount oflead-time to estimate the time series modelfrom which we can formulate inflation ex-pectations. Second, economic developments

lence theory, although the vast majority of the empirical

40in the 1950s took place against the backdrop
of post-war reconstruction. Finally, therewere regulations on the capital and foreignexchange markets which were only graduallydismantled.
The first half of the 1960s was characterised
by strongeconomic g rowth of almost 6%per annum on average and full employment.The high surplus on current account of thelate 1950s made room, after the revaluationof the Deutsche Mark in March 1961, for aslight deficit. This reverted, however, to amoderate surplus in the followingyears.Around the start of the decade both the realand the nominal money market rates were ata low level. The nominal capital market ratewas around 6%, which produced an expect-ed real interest rate of some 4%. Althoughthehighlevelofeconomicactivityinthemid-
dle of the decade, together with a gradualtightening of monetary policy, led to an in-crease in short and long-term real interestrates, these nonetheless remained relativelymoderate. Duringthe 1967 recession shortand long-term real interest rates then fellback to their previous levels of around 2%and4%respectively.
Macroeconomic developments in the next six
years were characterised by the turmoil onthe foreign exchange markets and the grad-ual demise of the Bretton-Woods system.

41onthe Deutsche Mark.Thiswasenhanced by
the marked increase in central bank rates,which was needed for cyclical reasons. TheBundesbank was only able to find a way outof the dilemma of whether to safeguard thedomestic or the external stability of the cur-rency after the dollar rate was finally floatedin March 1973. The Bundesbank took advan-tage of the newly gained freedom of actionand drew in the reins of monetary policy inorder to gain control over the rising inflation.Subsequently, short-term real interest ratesshot up from around 0% in mid-1972 to al-most8%inthelastquarterof1973.
15Justas
in 1966, the tightening of monetary policywent hand in hand with higher nominal cap-ital market rates. This increase was drivensolely by higher inflation expectations; the ex
antereal interest rate fell from around 6% in1969-70 to below 5% three years later. At
the same point in time the nominal capitalmarket rate exceeded the 10% mark for thefirsttime.
However, real interest rates on the money
market remained high for a short time only.Theeasingofmonetarypolicyagainstaback-drop of fairly weak monetary expansion andultimately the economic downturn in 1974 –due,inter alia, to the fact that the price of oil

42market rates. The use of the actual inflation
expected at the time instead of the past ex-pected inflation would presumably showmonetary policy to be less expansionary. Thecapital market rates reacted moremoderatelyto the new macroeconomic environment.Their decline was driven primarily by the ex-pected real interest rate, which fell from justover 5% in 1974 to below 1% three yearslater.
Against a background of major oil price rises
and strongmonetary g rowth, inflation in-creased again from 1979 onwards – even if,byinternationalcomparison,itwasverymod-erate and initially held in check by the strongexchange rate of the Deutsche Mark. How-ever, the upward pressure on the DeutscheMark soon changed into a downward pres-sure as a result of the very high interest rates
in the United States and Great Britain and amassive current account deficit. This causedthe Bundesbank to make a series of interestrate increases, which drove the nominalmoneymarketrateupto12%andtheshort-term real interest rate to 7% in summer1981. However, the increase in central bankrates did not pass through fully to the capitalmarket rate, which was just over 10% onaverage in 1981. Despite the slowdown inthe economy, the expected long-term realinterest rate in the same period rose to over6%; in addition to the tense situation onthe international capital market, the clear in-crease in government debt certainly also con-tributedtothis.Annual averages

43Owing to the high level of global interest
rates and the weakness of the DeutscheMark,thedescent fromtheinterestratepeakwas somewhat hesitant. Nonetheless, theovernight interest rate fell by 7 percentagepoints to 5% from the end of 1981 to spring1983. A turnaround began on the capitalmarket, too, although interest rates there de-clined far more slowly than on the moneymarket. The high interest rates in the UnitedStates and the appreciation of the US dollar,which peaked in 1985, played a role in this.The turnaround on the foreign exchangemarket, which was accompanied by a declinein interest rates on the US bond market,spurred the downward trend of German cap-ital market rates. The yield on domestic debtsecurities outstandingreached new lows,with valuesbelow6%,andthe expected realinterest rate fell to a very low level. In 1986and 1987 the Bundesbank cut the discountrate to a historical low of 2.5%. However,despite low nominal interest rates, as a resultof the low or even negative rates of inflationresultingfrom the oil price slide, short-termrealinterestratesremainedpersistentlyabove3%.
Asaresultoftherecoveryoftheglobalecon-
omy, nominal and real capital market ratesbegan to move upwards again in summer1987, while, at first, central bank rates re-mained unchanged, despite the fact that themonetary growth target was exceeded. Aftershare prices plummeted in October, centralbank rates were cut even further for a shorttime, which, however, put a temporary stoptotheincreaseincapitalmarketrates.OntheGerman capital market, interest rates werepushed up further by the announcement of a
withholdingtaxoninterest income, whichre-sulted in massive outflows of capital. Owingto the increasingrisks of inflation and theweakness of the Deutsche Mark, the Bundes-bank tightened its monetary policy from thesecond half of 1988. In the followingyears,in connection with the reunification boomand the accompanyingrise in prices, nominalmoney market rates rose again to more than9%, while real short-term rates went up to5%.Atthetimeofreunification,capitalmar-ket rates achieved a peak value of 9
1(6)T4%
owingto the uncertainties about the result-ant burdens. In 1990 the expected real inter-estrate (basedon surveys) was around5
1(6)T2%
asanannualaverage.
As the special trend of economic activity in
Germany came to an end and interest ratesbegan to fall worldwide from 1992 onwards,German capital market yields declined dis-tinctly. The fall in nominal interest rates wasdriven primarily by the movement of realinterest rates, which fell to 2% in winter1993-94. By contrast, inflation expectationschanged only minimally at first. The globalrise in interest rates induced by the raisingofthe central bank rates in the United States atthe start of 1994 halted the downward trendof German capital market rates only briefly.As the outlook for stability became increas-ingly brighter, interest rates fell across thewhole maturity range. From the end of 1993the real three-month rate was consistentlybelow 3%. If the 1970s, which were charac-terised by extreme macroeconomic disrup-tions, are excluded, this was the lowest realinterestratelevelsincethe1960s.Steadydescent

44From summer 1997 to spring1999 there
were severe disruptions to the internationalfinancial system. The turmoil began in South-East Asia but initially had only a slight impacton the industrial countries. However, thischanged after the devaluation of the roubleand the announcement of a moratorium onRussiandebtinAugust1998,followedbythecollapse of a large hedge fund in the UnitedStates in the followingmonth.
16In connec-
tion with the crisis in Russia large amounts offoreign funds flowed into the German bondmarket and pushed the nominal yield on do-mestic debt securities below the 4% markfor the first time. In Europe, interest ratemovements on the money and capital mar-kets continued to be shaped by the interestrate convergence process in the run-up toEuropean monetary union. This ultimatelymeant that in most countries interest rateswere lowered to the German level. At theend of the year and in the first quarter of1999 fears about an ongoing weakness ofthe economy put pressure on real interestrates,whichfelltobelow2%.
Subsequently, long-term real and nominal
interestratesfirstroseandthenfellbacksome-what.Thiscurveshowedtheinfluenceofinter-estratemovementsintheUnitedStates,cyclic-al and price trends in Europe and the Euro-system’s monetary policy. In spring2001 thereal interest rate level on the German capitalmarket–calculatedfromsurveys–wasaround2.8%; it was thus more than 1 percentagepointbelowtheaverageofthepast40years.
All in all, real interest rate movements in the
past 40 years reflect a number of influences.The list is headed by fluctuations in economic
activity, which were at times very marked.Then, mainly in the 1970s, there was greatuncertainty about the future development ofprices. At times, fiscal policies and inter-national influences also played a major role,explainingtheriseininterestratesatthestartof the 1980s, for instance. The internationallinks between interest rates strengthenednotably in the period under review, increas-ingly eclipsing domestic market influences.The Bundesbank’s monetary policy, whichwas directed primarily towards maintainingthe value of money, also affected the move-ment of real interest rates, particularly at theshort end, although the Bundesbank neverattempted to gear ongoing monetary policyto real interest rate expectations.

Concluding remarks
The real interest rate level is of key signifi-
cance for the development of the economyand long-term economic growth. Moreover,in many theoretical models the real interestrate gap – the deviation of the actual fromthe neutral real interest rate – is used as anindicatorofmonetarypolicystringency.
However,itisextremelydifficulttoimplement
the concept of the real interest rate gap inmonetary policy practice. To start with, meas-uringthe real interest rate level is colouredwith great uncertainty. The lack of a reliablemethod of calculation may possibly lead toserious misconceptions. Even a liquid marketfor inflation-linked bonds only solves thisproblem to a certain extent. For practical rea-sons, indexation needs a certain time lag– asa rule three months. Real money marketpaper with yields which at first sight mightprovide a key to the stringency of monetarypolicy are unlikely to resolve the underlyingproblems. Even moredifficult than estimatingthe actual real interest rates is calculatinganeutral reference rate. Although in recentyearssignificantprogressinspecifyingandes-timatingdynamic macroeconomic modelshasbeenmade,thesearestillfarfrom“readyforproduction”.Despite these measurement problems, real
interest rates contain important informationaboutinvestmenttermsonthecapitalmarketand the financingterms of the economy.However, as far as their relevance for monet-ary policy is concerned, they must be viewedin connection with other monetary policy in-dicators, in particular the money stock. Gear-ingmonetarypolicytoreducingtherealinter-est rates must, however, be rejected. On theone hand, the central bank’s scope for exert-inga direct influence is limited to the shortend of the interest rate spectrum. Althoughthese options also extend to the longend,the direction of impact is uncertain. The at-tempt to use an expansionary monetary pol-icy todrivelong-termrealinterestrates downcould therefore simply lead to price increasesin the medium term; these would in turn bereflected in a higher inflation risk premium.The best guarantee for favourable financingconditions is therefore a monetary policywhich is clearly oriented towards price stabil-ity.
Since the mid-1990s real interest rates have
been at a historically low level. The long-termreal interest rate derived from surveys is cur-rentlywellbelow3%.Therealmoneymarketrate based on the rate of inflation is merely1
1(6)T2%; based on the core inflation rate, it is
likely to be around 21(6)T2%. If the long-term
average is taken as a measure of the neutralinterest rate, the current real interest ratelevel isno impediment to sustained economicgrowth. The financing terms for investmentcontinuetobefavourable.Although

Theoretical considerations related to the
neutral real interest rate
Theneutralrealinterestrateistherealinterestrate
which has neither an expansionary nor a restrictiveimpact on the actual potential output. As this is areal economic concept, the monetary aspects willnotbeconsideredinthisAnnex.
Let us first consider the long-term equilibrium of
the real interest rate from the perspective ofgrowth theory.
17Households’ savingpattern (or
time preference) and technical progress are of par-ticular significance. The neo-classical Solow-typegrowth model assumes the existence of a macro-economic production function with constant re-turns to scale and assumes that the savingpatternis constant (i.e. a fixed proportion s of the netnational product is saved). Given that investmentand savings should be equal, it follows thatK.(t)+dK(t)=sY(t). The change in the capital stock
K.plus the depreciation dK(t) corresponds to the s
ofthenetnationalproductY(t),i.e.thesavings.
In a long-term state of equilibrium, growth is ul-
timately the result of an increase in the volume ofwork or the outcome of technical progress; thecapital stock adjusts to these exogenous factors.Although an increase in the savings rate wouldleadtoanincreaseinthecapitalstock–andhenceof the net national product Y(K) – this wouldnot have an impact on long-term growth rates.With an increase in the “effective” output atrate g, in a long-term equilibrium the relationshipsf(k)=(g+ d)kapplies,wheref(k)istheproduction
function and k the capital stock relative to the ef-fective labour input. Two important connectionsarise from this relationship. An increase in the pro-pensity to save s leads to a lower real interest rate
and an increase in the rate of technical progressproduces a higher real interest rate. That can beexplained as follows: if the propensity to save s in-creases, this promotes capital formation and moreproduction is profitable. If technology remains un-changed, the marginal productivity of capital f’(k)sinks. The real interest rate – the difference be-tween the rate of marginal return of the capitaland the depreciation rate – r=f’(k)– dtherefore
falls. A similar line of argument leads to the afore-mentioned effect of an increase in the growthrateoftechnicalprogress.
The simple older growth models were particularly
heavily criticised for assumingthat the saving s rates is exogenous, rather than the outcome of an op-timal intertemporal consumer choice by the eco-nomic agents. This shortcoming is removed inRamsey’s growth model (which was developedearlierbutonlyreceivedattentionfarlateron).Thebasis of this model is a representative householdwhich optimises its consumption over time. Thetime preference rate, in other words the degree of“impatience”,isinthiscaseexogenous.Theactualsavingpatternisdeterminedendogenously.Anim-portant outcome of Ramsey’s model is what isknown as the Keynes-Ramsey rule. It states thatthe optimal (maximal utility) growth rate of percapita consumption is a function of the differencebetween the real interest rate and the time prefer-encerate.

47If the real interest rate, in other words the real
yield rate of a delayed consumption, is greaterthan the time preference rate, there are advan-tages to be gained from postponing consumption.The growth rate of consumption will therefore bepositive, which has a negative effect on invest-ment. In a state of equilibrium, the real interestrate is a function of the time preference rate, thegrowth rate of technical progress and populationgrowth. One also talks of the “modified goldenrule”.
18The effect of a change in the time prefer-
ence rate in the Ramsey model is similar to that ofa change in the savings ratein the Solow model. Iftheeconomicagents’timepreferenceratedeclines– i.e. present consumption is weighted less thanfuture consumption – households save more andthe real interest rate falls. In the Ramsey model,much as in the Solow model, a rise in the rate oftechnicalprogressleadstoariseintherealinterestrate.
Unfortunately, these data do not stand up well to
other modifications. For instance, the real interestrate in some models of the endogenous growththeory is completely unrelated to the economicagents’ saving pattern. Even more problematic isthe situation in growth models with overlappinggenerations. In these models, such as that de-veloped by Diamond, multiple equilibria can occur,with the result that the real interest ratecannot beclearlydefined.
In the comments so far the determinants of real
interest rates in long-term balanced growth havebeen discussed. In addition, however, the effect oftemporary shocks on real interest rates is also ofinterest.Thisissuecanbeexaminedwiththeaidofmore recent simulation models. These are dynamicstochastic equilibrium models – or DGSE models
forshort–andrepresent,inprinciple,afurtherde-velopmentofRamsey’smodel.
If the effects of temporary technology and de-
mand shocks are depicted in this kind of model, atemporary positive technology shock has two dif-ferent effects.
19Higher productivity raises, on the
one hand, the willingness to invest and thereforebringsaboutanincreaseintherealinterestrate,asin the Solow and Ramsey models. As the technol-ogy shock is only temporary, household incomerises only temporarily and the economic agents at-tempt to distribute the additional possible con-sumption over time by increasingtheir saving s.This effect produces a decline in the real interestrate and can overcompensate for the initial effect,with the result that the real interest rate falls tem-porarily.
By contrast, a demand shock leads to a short-term
rise in the real interest rate. This effect is similar toa decline in the savings in the Solow model or toanincreaseinthetimepreferencerateintheRam-sey model. In the longterm, however, the realinterest rate changes only if there is a change inthe pattern of saving. Positive supply shocks canlead in the short term to a reduction in the realinterest rate. However, a lastingincrease in therate of growth of technical progress produces ariseinthelong-termrealinterestrate.
18Theoriginalgoldenruleofcapital accumulation maxi-
mises the net national product in the long-term equilib-
rium but takes no account of the preferences of the eco-
nomicagentswithregardtotheconsumptiondate.

49Factorprices,
employmentandcapitalstockinGermany:resultsofasimulationstudyThis article examines long-run trends
in quantity and price changes in theproduction factors labour and capitalfor the period 1970 to 2000. Basedon national accounts data, it firstdescribes the growth contributions ofthe two factors. Next, the differenteffects of wage cost pressure (includ-ing the government levy burden) overtime are analysed using a simulation.For the 1970s, in particular, evidence isfound that an expansionary wage pol-icy, entailing initially moderate em-ployment losses, may influence thefunctional distribution of income intheshortrunin favour ofthe factor la-bour. In the longer run, however, theemployment situation deteriorated inthe wake of slackening capital forma-tion (caused not least by wage policy)and a growing capital intensity, andincome distribution was readjusted infavour of the factor capital. A similar(albeit less pronounced) pendulumpattern is evident for Germany as awhole since reunification. The inverseimplicationofthesefindingsisthatthesustained pursuit of a moderate wagepolicy, as has been initiated in the pastfew years, can lead to a lasting im-provementinemploymentprospects.

50minantsof wage and employment develop-
ments over the past few decades shows thatin western Germany between 1970 and2000, asals o in Germany asa whole from1991 onwards, unemployment increasedstep-wise, amid cyclical fluctuations, to anever-higher plateau. A salient feature is themarked rigidity with which unemploymentlargely persists even after a recession hasbeen overcome. Variousapproachesto ex-plaining this “persistence phenomenon”have been developed in the literature. Laboureconomists place particular emphasis on theso-called “insider-outsider problem” on thelabour market. Put simply, this means thatpeople still in jobs following a cyclical fall inemployment are usually not prepared to ori-ent their wage demandss ufficiently to theemployment interests of the unemployed.This insider-outsider dichotomy is further re-inforced if a spell of unemployment leads toskill losses which, given unchanged wagestructures, hamper the reintegration of thelong-term unemployed, in particular, into theemployment process.

Thisarticle examinesthe s ys tematic feedbackeffectsbetween the factorslabour and cap-ital as an additional source of persistentunemployment. Thisrequiresan analyticalframework which distinguishes betweenshort-run and long-run effects of wage policy.It can draw on studies which do not analysethe effectsof wage policy s olely in relation tothe labour market. Instead, these studies takeit asread that the two key macroeconomicproduction factorslabour and capital areinterrelated. Whereasin the s hort run aneconomy’s capital stock is largely constant, inthe long run it isthe more flexible and more
mobile factor which, via the choice of tech-nologiesdeployed, hasa major influence onthe employment prospects of labour. Notleast for this reason the wage formation inthe labour market isof particular importance.In particular, owing to the inherent nature ofthe interaction between the two productionfactors, the short-run effects of wage policymay turn out to be different from itslong-runeffects, with the speed of the adjustmentdynamicsbeing determined by technologicaland economic factors.

Weak capital formation can be explained to alarge extent as a lagged response to phasesof strong wage pressure. Such phases can beidentified, in particular, for the 1970sand thefirst half of the 1990s. Owing to the feedbackeffect between the two factors, however, theresulting employment losses were not con-fined to those periods. The phase of re-strained wage settlements notably in the1980ss howsthat an employment-orientedwage policy requiresa long-term orientation

51and must be credibly anchored. If, by adopt-
ing such a stance, expectations regarding fu-ture factor price developmentscan be s tabil-ised, the long-run employment gains of a re-strained wage policy should be far superior tothose of a “stop-and-go” policy which runsthe risk of never reaping the rewards of itscontinuously interrupted efforts.
In addition, the study confirms for Germany a
finding that has also been ascertained forother continental European countries, namelythat since the 1980s a structural shift hasbeen evident regarding the quantity and priceratiosof labour and capital which hasled to agreater capital intensity of production.
3A key
explanation for thisfinding could be that, asthe German economy isbecoming more andmore embedded within the European andglobal division of labour, labour-intensive ac-tivitieshave been trans ferred increas ingly toother countries. Wage policy makers shouldtake account of thisdevelopment by permit-ting a wider wage spread that is more in linewith productivity differences. In the case ofunskilled jobs, in particular, they should en-sure that a system of wage formation morestrongly geared to productivity is harmonisedwith the level of unemployment benefitsinsuch a way that gives unemployed people anincentive to take up work.
The relevant wage measure in this connection
isthe real product wage. Asfar asthe em-ployment effectsare concerned, it isirrele-vant whether the wage pressure results froma heavier burden of government taxesandsocial security contributions on labour orfrom higher net wages.

policy that is responsible for the extent of thewage pressure. “Real” in this context refersto firms’ selling prices net of indirect tax bur-dens. The consumer price index is not a suit-0Western Germany

Productionfactorsandfactorpricesfrom
along-runperspective
The empirical results for the period 1970 to
2000 discussed below relate to the enterprisesector on the basis of national accounts data.A long-run analysis stretching back beyond1990 encountersunavoidable methodologic-al problemscaus ed by the unification-relatedstatistical breaks in the time series for 1990and 1991. Another point to bear in mind isthat the figuresfor Germany asa whole from1991 onwardsare bas ed on the new ESA 95classification system, whereas a consistentdata set for western Germany is availableonly up to the year 1995 on the conceptualand classificatory basis of ESA 79. These twofactors lead to considerable “disruptions” inthe time series. This study therefore follows atwo-step approach: first, it analyses west Ger-man conditionsfor the period 1970 to 1995and then widensto a pan-German view forthe period 1991 to 2000. In order to con-strain the results to market-based processes,the peculiaritiesof the two s ectors“govern-ment” and “housing (including owner-occupied housing)” are disregarded as far aspossible. The data material therefore com-prises the enterprise sector excluding hous-ing.The role which the production factorsplay in
the creation of value added at the aggregatelevel and how, in particular, the factor quan-tity ratio has shifted over time can be shownfor the period 1970 to 1995 using a simplegrowth accounting exercise. Such growth ac-counting isroutinely employed in order to at-tribute changesin the aggregate value added(output) to changesin the quantitiesof thetwo production factorslabour and capital orto “explain” them via the so-called total fac-tor productivity. The latter describes economicgrowth achieved at a constant input level ofthe production factorslabour and capital andisthusa meas ure of technical progres s(for adetailed explanation see the box on page 56).
The output variable that isto be explained it-
self shows a marked cyclical movement dur-ing the period under review. Starting fromhigh growth ratesin the early 1970s , the de-velopment of output then reflectsthe reces -sions which followed the two oil price crises(with a significant recovery in between), therobust upturn in the second half of the 1980swhich, buoyed by the reunification of Ger-many, extended until 1991, and the subse-quent downturn in 1992/93. Over the entireobservation period, output grew at an aver-age annual rate of 2.3% amid a decliningoverall growth trend.
For proxying the relative contribution to out-
put of the factor capital measured over ayear, it is assumed for the sake of simplicitythat thishasa fixed relations hip to the capitalstock.
5On this assumption the production-

53related growth rate of the capital stock, and
hence the assumed growth rate of the ser-vicesof capital, amounted to an annual aver-age of 3.2%. The dynamicsof capital forma-tion over the observation period show a no-ticeable decline. Thusdes pite a temporary re-covery in the late 1980sand early 1990s , therate of capital accumulation tended to de-cline throughout the period under review.
6
The labour input into the production processismeas ured by the total hoursworked peryear in the enterprise sector. Except for abrief recovery phase from 1988 to 1992, totalhoursworked declined in abs olute termsthroughout the observation period. The re-duction averaged 0.9% per year. It should benoted that the number of employed personsremained virtually constant on average duringthe whole of the observation period. Hencethe fall in the total hoursworked isattribut-able more or less entirely to a reduction in theaverage hoursworked by each employed per-son.
The divergent evolution of the two inputsin
the form of a growing capital stock and a de-clining total of hoursworked – in relation towestern Germany for reasons of data avail-ability – leadsto marked differencesin theaverage annual growth contributionsof thetwo factorsin the period 1970 to 1995.
7
Whereasroughly 1 percentage point of theaverage annual output change of 2.3% maybe attributed to the factor capital, the contri-bution of the factor labour wasa negative– 0.6 percentage point. The growth analysisimpliesthat the large res idual amount of al-most 2 percentage points on average wasdue to total factor productivity. These high
valuesfor the rate of total factor productivityand the negative growth contribution of la-bour result largely from the explicit definitionof the labour input astotal hoursworked anddiverge from studies which instead use thenumber of employed persons as the measureof labour input. Under that alternative ap-proach, the growth contribution of labourworksout at more or les szero, whereastotalfactor productivity fallsto an annual averageof 1.3 percentage points. From a theoreticalpoint of view, however, measuring the labourinput astotal hoursworked isa more s uitableindicator because a view based only on thenumber of employed persons does not cap-ture changesin working time and thereforetendsto underes timate total factor productiv-ity in phases of reduced working time, whichare typical of the observation period.
8
The fact that the arithmetical growth contri-bution of labour turnsout to be negativethroughout the long period under reviewper se doesnot yield any clear-cut welfare
implications. Thus the reduction of workingtime may lead to desirable gains in leisuretime which have to be offset against the mar-ket income losses. Furthermore, a negativegrowth contribution of labour would be un-surprising in connection with a contractinglabour force.

The growth model commented on in the text

(1)∆Yt
Yt–1= α t . ∆Kt
Kt–1+ (1 – α t) .∆Ht

The calculation relates to data on the enter-
prise sector excluding housing.1The variable
Ystandsfortherealgrossvalueaddedatcon-
stant 1991 prices. The capital stock Kis com-
puted as an annual average value of grossfixed capital formation at constant 1991prices,i.e.itisdefinedasthetotalfixedassetsusedinproduction,excludinglandandinven-tories. Gross fixed capital formation is calcu-lated according to the perpetual inventoryapproach, which uses long investment seriesas well as data on the estimated useful life offixed assets. Unlike the net concept of meas-uring the capital stock, the assets’ economicwearandtearisnotdeductedcontinuouslyasconsumption of fixed capital. Instead, assetsare valued as new up to the end of their esti-matedusefullife.
The variable Hstands for total hours worked
using data from the Institut f/C252r Arbeitsmarkt-
und Berufsforschung (Institute for Employ-
ment Research). Using a broad measure of la-bour costs, the income share of labour 1- a
comprises not only employee compensationbut also an implied labour income for self-employed persons. This implied figure is cal-culated on the basis of the employee hourly
wage rate. As the capital stock is computedfrom data on gross fixed capital formation,the income share of labour is related to thegross value added by the enterprise sectorand not (as is customary for computing therelative share of wages or employee compen-sation) to national income. The growth rateof the variable G,which is known as the So-
low residual or the change in total factorproductivity, denotes the autonomous shareof output growth that cannot be attributedtochangesintheinputvolumes.
As the cyclically fluctuating degree of cap-
acity utilisation, especially of the capitalstock, is not explicitly modelled, the Solowre-sidual displays a strongly cyclical behaviour.For the values which particularly interest ushere – i.e. the average growth contributionsof the two inputs and of total factor product-ivity – this approach is not a great problem,however.
2Even when adjusted for cyclical ef-
fects, trend estimates of total factor product-ivity cannot be readily interpreted as a meas-ure of (non-observable) technical progress.Hence the growth accounting according toequation (1) is exact only if constant returnsto scale in the aggregate production functionand price-taking behaviour are specified.
3
Moreover, within the framework of a micro-study it would also be necessary to take ac-count of the qualitative changes in the factorinputs.

other than “general government, households, non-profitinstitutions serving households”. — 2A substantiated
methodofdeterminingthetrendoftotalfactorproductiv-ity is contained, for example, in Roeger (1994) who, in acapital vintage approach, uses the average age of the cap-ital stock to determine the trend: Roeger, W., Total factorproductivity in West German manufacturing, Is there in-vestment-induced technical progress?, Allgemeines Statis-tisches Archiv, 78, 251–61, 1994. — 3For further details see

the case of level comparisons using results from moremicrobasedstudiesoftheUSBureauofLaborStatistics.Fora detailed analysis which attempts to take account of thechangesintheskillslevelofthefactorlabour,seethecross-country study O’Mahony, M., Britain’s productivity perfor-mance 1950 – 1996, An International perspective, NIESR,1999. For Germany for the period 1973 to 1995, usingconventional growth accounting, O’Mahony initially cal-culatesanaveragegrowthratefortotalfactorproductivityof 1.7%. She subsequently shows that this variable turnsout to be somewhat smaller if quality adjustments in thefactor labour are included.

55In fact, however, the number of employed
persons in western Germany rose by around4 million between 1970 and 1995, with anaverage annual increase of 0.6%. Unemploy-ment increased over the same period step-wise, with the level rising sharply after eachof the two oil price crises. Starting from anunemployment rate (asdefined in the nation-al accounts) of 0.6% in 1970, the jobless ratehad risen to over 8% by the mid-1990s. Thisshows that the labour market has been sub-ject to serious disruptions since the early1970s.
9
If thisres ult iscombined with the finding of aslackening rate of capital formation, it seemslikely that the functional disruptions on thelabour market had repercussions on the fac-tor capital. In the early 1970s, in particular,wage policy took insufficient account of thedecelerating rate of productivity growth. Theexcessive wage increases compared with theproductivity gainswere partly to blame forthe failure to achieve full employment. Thiswasaccompanied by a decline in the real rateof return on capital, which wasamplified bythe oil price shock. This had a dampeningeffect on capital accumulation and, via thecomplementarity of the two factorsin theproduction process, the weaker propensity toinvest exacerbated the employment situation.Thisisa prime illus tration of the fact that thecapital s tock, asan endogenousvariable, isamajor entrepreneurial adjustment parameter.Thusthe correction of the ratio of factorprices following a steep rise in wages normal-ly results in a reduced supply of capital. Thisreinforcesthe decline in employment trig-gered by the original wage shock.Resultsofasimulationstudy
The “induced capital shortage” following a
steep increase in wage costs is largely causedby a preceding shift in relative factor prices –this is shown by a simulation study carriedout by the Bundesbank (see the box on pages60–61). The starting point of the study is theWestern Germany

56real product wage (based on total hours
worked).10Asa us eful complement to this , a
simple return on fixed capital may be com-puted which calculatesthe rate of return onthe capital stock as that part of income whichdoesnot accrue to the factor labour. Thisre-turn variable displays a conspicuous U shape:in 1990/91, following a low in 1982, it moreor less regains its initial level of 1970. Thispattern holdsregardles sof whether, asin thiscase, one measures gross fixed capital forma-
tion and values the capital stock at constantpricesor whether, alternatively, the s tudy isbased on replacement prices and a net con-cept of capital formation in which the returnsand the capital stock are adjusted for the con-sumption of fixed capital.
11
Unlike the return on capital, the real wage ona long-run view istypically a growing variableand therefore hasno natural reference value.To further explore the interaction betweenfactor pricesand factor quantities , therefore,a simple trend adjustment is made – in linewith general practice – which takesaccountof technical progress. In addition, a labourmarket equilibrium iss imulated which pro-vides insights into changes in wage-settingbehaviour and in labour demand.
Asexplained in greater detail in the box on

11In itscalculation of the rate of return on capital, the
German Council of Economic Experts (SachverstTC228ndigen-
rat)values the net capital stock, including inventories, at
purchase or manufacturing prices. The finding of a
U-shaped evolution of the rate of return holds for this ap-
proach, too. However, attempting to capture entrepre-
neurs’ propensity to invest using aggregated national ac-
countsdata hascertain limitations . In particular, the ex
postperspective presented by the national accounts data
can only very roughly capture entrepreneurs’ expected
rate of return, which normally underliesinves tment deci-
sions.Western

57interaction between the relative factor price
effect and the reaction of factor quantities,the income share of labour in the gross valueadded nevertheless increases initially, i.e. theexpansionary real wage effect at first out-weighsthe negative employment effect. Thusin the early 1980sthe income s hare of labourwasaround 3 percentage pointshigher thanin 1970.
Owing to capital formation adjustment pro-
cesses, however, this situation did not persist.In 1990 the factor price ratio wasagain al-most at the same level as in the referenceyear 1970, and the income share of labourfell distinctly below the level of 1970.
12The
ratio of factor quantitiesdid not fully matchthe downward movement of the factor priceratio during the 1980s. The labour marketsimulation implies rather that from the mid-1980s – in the sense of a negative labour de-mand shock – entrepreneurs resorted system-atically to more capital-intensive technolo-gies. As can be seen from the scatter plot onpage 61, the previously stable correspond-ence between the ratiosof factor pricesandquantities shifted, with the result that ahigher capital intensity becomes apparent fora given relative factor price relation.
13
This move towards increased capital intensityplaced greater demands on a successful wagepolicy measured by an employment target.The fall in the income share of labour duringthe 1980ss howsthat wage policy makerswere prepared to allow increases in the realproduct wage which were lower than theaverage growth of labour productivity (perhour worked by each employed person). Butit wasnot until the end of the 1980sthat this
wage restraint led to a certain easing of ten-sion on the labour market. However, at thestart of the 1990s a new phase of strongwage pressure began, which again worsenedthe situation on the labour market.
The simulation results for the west German
enterprise sector and labour market from1970 to 1995 cannot simply be expanded toreunified Germany between 1991 and 2000.Despite the unification-related exceptionaldevelopments and statistical-methodologicalproblems
14, however, an attempt ismade in
the following to qualitatively augment theabove analysis by some tendencies for Ger-many asa whole.
15
In contrast to the strong upturn in the secondhalf of the 1980s, which was robustly extend-ed for a time by unification, the period 1991to 2000 asa whole ischaracteris ed by a ra-
12Thisfinding holdseven if, asan alternative meas ure of
income distribution, one considers the labour income
ratio computed by the German Council of Economic Ex-
perts. Corresponding calculations are contained in its
1998/99 Annual Report, page 289 (German version).
13This shifts remains, albeit in a weaker form, if the fac-
tor quantity ratio of the current period iscaptured asa
function of lagged factor pricesof previousperiods .
14For example, according to the revised figures from au-
tumn 2000, the number of employed persons in Ger-
many in 1991 wasover 5% higher than originally s ug-
gested, amid a largely constant aggregate value added.
Thiseffect, which ens uesmainly from the greater inclu-
sion of low-paid part-time workers, should be distin-
guished from the unification-induced change in the num-
ber of employed persons. Owing to a reduction in the
number of hoursworked per employed pers on, the in-
crease in the total hours worked is smaller, at just over
3%. See also Deutsche Bundesbank, Revision of employ-
ment figures, Monthly Report, November 2000, page 36;

−analytical framework and simulation results −
Deutsche BundesbankAssume that the aggregate output Y in a representative
period t may be described as follows:
(1)
In equation (1) Kdenotes the aggregate capital  stock and
Hthe labour input (measured as the total  hours worked). It is
assumed that technical  progress occurs exogenously at aconstant rate gand  is labour-augmenting. The expression
AH  accordingly measures total hours worked in efficiency
units. The production function F(.,.) is subject to constant
returns to scale. To be able to describe the long-run growthequilibrium  using stationary variables, the capital stock and
output are related to labour in efficiency units, with:
k = K / AH   and y = Y /AH = F(K / AH,1) = f(k) .  The individual firm is
assumed to act as a price-taker and for a given real wage
w(on an hourly  basis) chooses the desired labour input in line
with its labour demand curve.  Assume  wages  are  formedthrough collective bargaining between trade  unions andemployer federations but are taken by the  individual
producers as given. The assumption of  constant returns to
scale implies that the  following  holds  for  the  real  wage
w
 EU(in efficiency units)  and  the  gross  rate  of  return  on
capital  r :
(2)
Equation (2) says that the factor prices cannot be chosen
independently of one another and that the ratio of factor
quantities (k) is rather a rising function of the ratio of factorprices ( w
 EU/r) at an initially undetermined level of inputs.
In the short run let the capital stock Kbe fixed, i.e. the capital
stock is a shift parameter of the labour demand curve. Theshort-run labour market equilibrium is described graphicallyby the intersection of the labour demand curve (DD) and the
wage-setting curve (SS), which mirrors the overall bargaining
constellation on the labour market.
In the long run the capital stock is determined endogenously.
Various approaches to fixing the long-run equilibrium arepossible. Blanchard (1997, 1998) considers a small openeconomy model with an exogenously given rate of return on
capital r
 *. Owing to factor adjustment costs, the short and
long-run  equilibria  may  differ  temporarily. Over time, how-ever, capital formation adjusts ( “shift  of  the DD curve ”) until
the short and long-run equilibria coincide at E, so that the
following holds:
(3)
An alternative approach is taken by Kaas/v.Thadden (2001)
who consider the case of a closed economy. Using a growth
model augmented by wage bargaining, they show that, under
certain assumptions, the ratios of factor prices and quantities
coincide in the long run with those of the completelycompetitive benchmark economy, whereas in the short runthey may differ because of shocks. For example, assume that a
permanent shift occurs in the wage-setting curve caused by an
increase in insider power. In the short run (move from Eto F )
the following shifts occur along the short-run labour demandcurve: wages rise, employment and the rate of return on
capital fall and - assuming the elasticity of substitution
between labour and capital 
σis smaller than 1 - the income
share of labour increases. However, the smaller expected
return on capital leads (temporarily) to weaker capitalformation. This weakness of capital formation is accompaniedby further employment losses. In the new long - run equilib-rium ( G) the ratio of factor quantities, the ratio of factor prices
and the income distribution coincide with those of the initial
equilibrium E, albeit at a permanently lower level of the cap-HSS’

σital stock and employment than in the initial situation.
In the following simulation 1970 is the reference year. For
computing the index values of the labour-saving technical pro-
gress from the Solow decomposition of output growth, theresidual was first divided by the income share of labour. Next
the degree of freedom for fixing the level of the index was
used to set the ratio of factor prices w
 EU / rin 1970 equal to
unity. Persistent deviations of the capital intensity (in effi-
ciency units) kand of the ratio of factor prices w EU / rfrom the
reference values for 1970 are interpreted as indications ofchanges in the relationship between the factors. The function-al forms in Blanchard (1997, 1998) are assumed when calcula-
ting the labour demand and supply shocks. The following
holds for the wage-setting curve (with 
βas the elasticity of
w EUin relation to the employment rate N  / N and Θas a shift
parameter of the curve):
(4)
With 1970 assumed as the reference value for the steady state
and u = 1 −N / N as the level of unemployment in period t, the
labour supply shock z in period tcan be approximated via:
(5)
To facilitate comparability with Blanchard (1997, 1998), βwas
set at 1 in the simulation. Assuming a CES production func-
tion, the following equation holds via the first-order condition
for labour demand, where (1 − α ) is defined as the annual
average income share of labour and cis a shift parameter of
the curve:
(6)
Shifts in the demand for labour ( “labour demand shocks ”) are
computed using the formula:
(7)
As no uniform estimate for the elasticity of substitution
σexists in the econometric literature, two scenarios are used
for computing the labour demand shock, namely σ =1 (Cobb-
Douglas) and σ = 0.7; they lead to qualitatively similar results.Ratio of factor quantities versus

60ther flat growth path and weak capital for-
mation. The average annual increase in valueadded amounted to only 1.6%, although thisfigure wasexceeded in the yearss ince 1997.At the same time, the rate of expansion ofthe capital stock, at barely 2% in the pastcouple of years, remains distinctly lower thanin the 1980s.For the whole of the period 1991 to 2000,
the labour market wasrelatively weak. In2000 both the number of employed personsand the total hoursworked were down onthe corresponding level in 1991. However,the labour market situation – following sharpsetbacks in the first half of the 1990s – hasbrightened perceptibly in the past few yearsin line with the general cyclical recovery. Thusthe number of employed persons has risencontinuously since 1998.
16Thisispartly
borne out by the fact that the overall un-employment rate in 2000 of just under 8%wasdis tinctly below the peak figure of 9.5%reached in 1997. Despite this significant im-provement, however, it wass till well abovethe 1991 level of not quite 5.5%.
In the context of a growing labour supply and
a high level of (initially masked) unemploy-ment in eastern Germany, a massive devalu-ation of productive assets, in the form offixed and human capital, occurred in the firsthalf of the 1990s. This was accompanied byhigh wage pressure during this period, lead-ing for a time to a pronounced shift in thefactor price ratio towardsa relative increas ein labour costs. Since the mid-1990s the fac-tor price ratio hasmanifes ted a marked coun-terswing, not least on account of the sub-dued investment activity during the 1990s.While the starting level of 1991 has not quitebeen reached, signs of an improvement areapparent, recalling west German develop-mentsin the 1980s .

state level during the past few years, princi-pally thanksto the moderate wage policy.
However, our simulation model shows that
persistent employment successes cannot beexpected from short-run or temporary adjust-mentson the factor markets– that requireslong-term efforts. Furthermore, sustained
employment gainsrequire more than an ap-propriate overall factor price ratio, which hasbeen the focusof thisarticle. Such a policymust rather be complemented and reinforcedby ongoing structural reforms on the productand factor markets.
