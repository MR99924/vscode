5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Economy as a wholeAccording to the initial calculations of the
Federal Statistical Office, there was a fairlystrong rise in overall economic output in thefirst quarter of 2000 as well. After adjustmentfor seasonal and working-day variations, itwas
34% up on the autumn months of 1999.
The German economy has thus been growingat an annualised rate of almost 3% since themiddle of last year. After eliminating calendarvariations, real gross domestic product (GDP)was 2.3% up on the year. In calendar-monthterms, the figure was 3.3%. The producingsector (excluding construction) made thelargest contribution to growth, with a season-ally adjusted rise in value added on the previ-ous quarter of 1
34% in real terms. Positive
stimuli also came from the service industries.By contrast, there was a further slight fall inconstruction output despite the favourableweather conditions in the winter months.
ManufacturingDemand for manufactured goods continued
to become more buoyant in April. Accordingto initial preliminary data (which will, how-ever, probably be revised downwards whenthe reports for April are available in their en-tirety), the level in March, in seasonally ad-justed terms and at constant prices, was ex-ceeded by 2
12%. Compared with the same
month last year, there was a rise of almost15%. That figure also reflects changes in thegroup of reporting firms as well as a numberof major orders, and thus, overall, somewhatGDP in

6overstates the positive underlying economic
trend.
Domestic incoming orders were particularly
buoyant, with the capital goods sector re-cording the highest rates of growth, althoughthe producers of intermediate goods and ofdurable and non-durable goods received sig-nificantly more orders. In April, foreign orderswere not quite as high as in March, however,although the average level of the first twomonths of 2000 was clearly exceeded.
According to the available statistical data,
seasonally adjusted manufacturing output inApril showed a further sharp rise. The year-on-year increase, which had amounted to7% in March, went up by
12percentage
point. The current figures are, however, stillprovisional in many respects: firstly, the cor-rection factor for adjustment to the quarterlyoutput survey has been derived from lastyear’s figures and, secondly, the index levelfor April is still partly based on the higher re-ports for March.
ConstructionOverall, demand for construction work picked
up somewhat in March (more recent data areunavailable at present). Taking the first threemonths of 2000 together, however, the levelin the autumn months of 1999 were ex-ceeded by no more than
12% in seasonally
adjusted terms. The year-on-year decline in-creased to 7%. Public building projects, inparticular, played a part in this. By contrast,towards the end of the period under review,significantly more orders for road construc-New method of seasonal adjustment
for figures of the national accounts
Commencing with the publication of the figures for the
first quarter of 2000, the quarterly figures of the na-tional accounts (gross domestic product and selecteddata on the origin and use of the gross domestic pro-duct and on the distribution of income) will be season-ally adjusted using the Census X-12-ARIMA method, ver-sion 0.2.5.
1Work on calculating the seasonally adjusted
data and seasonally and working-day-adjusted data willbe undertaken jointly with the Federal Statistical Office.This means that, from now on, the Bundesbank and theFederal Statistical Office will be publishing identical sea-sonally adjusted figures for the national accounts.
Statistical adjustment will take due account of the spe-
cial features of the individual time series and additionaleconomic information.
The seasonally adjusted figures of the national accounts
using the new X-12-ARIMA method can still be com-pared with the seasonally adjusted monthly economicindicators (such as output and orders received) whichhave hitherto been estimated using the Census X-11method. These indicators, too, will be changed over tothe new X-12 ARIMA method of seasonal adjustment inseveral stages, however.

7tion than before came from the central, re-
gional and local authorities. Demand for resi-dential construction persisted at a low level.
Construction output in April showed a slight
seasonally adjusted fall compared withMarch, and a decline of more than 9% com-pared with the same month last year. Theyear-on-year figure is still subject to the quali-fication that all the data from March onwardshave yet to be adjusted to the results of theannual survey in construction. Nevertheless,other indicators suggest that constructionoutput is indeed following demand, whichhas been weak for some time.
Labour marketThe favourable overall development on the la-
bour market continued in May. At the end ofthat month, 3.90 million persons were un-employed, seasonally adjusted, i.e. just under30,000 fewer than at the end of April and210,000 fewer than a year before. The un-employment rate was 9.6%. As in the preced-ing months, the situation on the labour marketimproved, above all, in western Germany,although there was no further deterioration ineastern Germany. In total, 670,000 personswere participating in vocational training pro-grammes for the unemployed and in job-cre-ation schemes. This was 15,000 more than inApril, but 160,000 fewer than 12 monthspreviously.
In March (more recent data are unavailable at
present) employment rose once again slightlyin seasonally adjusted terms to 36.23 millionpersons, which was just over 100,000 moreEconomic conditions in Germany*

with the level 12 months previously, this wasan increase of slightly more than 75,000 per-sons in work.
PricesFor the first time in a long while, seasonally
adjusted consumer prices in May showed amonth-on-month fall. This is probably due,firstly, to the fact that the price data were col-lected around the middle of the month. Forthat reason, the price index did not yet in-clude higher fuel prices, which had started togo up towards mid-May in the wake of arenewed rise in crude oil prices and the weak-ness of the euro. Secondly, the prices forpackage tours fell sharply month-on-monthon account of the late Easter. Manufacturedproducts also became cheaper. The overallyear-on-year rise decreased to 1.4%.
Seasonally adjusted import prices fell in April,
mainly as a result of the temporary weaknessof crude oil prices in the international mar-kets. Overall, imported goods were 9.8%more expensive at the end of the periodunder review than they had been one yearearlier. Excluding sources of energy, importprices rose further not least owing to the ex-change rate; the year-on-year rise increasedto 5%.
In contrast to import prices, German indus-
trial producer prices (in domestic sales) didnot ease in April. Although mineral oil wascheaper for a time owing to the influence ofthe world markets, natural gas (the prices forwhich are often coupled with a time lag tocrude oil prices) went up by around 10%
compared with March. Overall, German in-dustrial products were 2.1% dearer in Aprilthan 12 months previously.
Public finance
Federal cash trendsIn May the Federal Government recorded a
cash deficit amounting to not quite 32 bil-
lion, which was 3
34billion less than the cor-
responding figure for 1999. In April the Fed-eral Government, on receipt of the Bundes-bank profit, had recorded a cash surplus of31
12billion. The Federal cash deficit in the
first five months of this year, taken together,amounted to slightly over 314
12billion, com-
pared with more than 317 billion for the
same period in 1999. The reason for this nar-rowing of the Federal deficit was a 4% de-cline in cash expenditure, while cash receiptswere only 2
12% below their corresponding
level of one year before. In the course of theyear, however, cash figures may differ consid-erably from the trends envisaged in thebudgetary accounts.
Public sector borrowingBorrowing by the central, regional and local
authorities increased by slightly less than 32
12
billion in April, following an expansion by just
over 314 billion in the first quarter. The rela-
tively subdued rise in borrowing in April maybe attributed to the Bundesbank’s profit trans-fer to the Federal Government, which greatlyreduced the latter’s borrowing needs. Thus,Consumer

9the Federal Government was able to cut
down its liabilities by slightly more than 3112
billion, a redemption of money market debt
to the tune of 33 billion, on balance, offset-
ting net capital market borrowing of almost31
12billion. Capital market borrowing
centred around the sale of five-year specialFederal bonds, which yielded 31 billion net.
At the same time, the Federal Government is-sued Treasury notes worth slightly more than3
12billion net. By contrast, it redeemed Fed-
eral bonds to the tune of just over 312billion
on balance. The Länder Governments, whichexpanded their capital market debt by slightlymore than 33
12billion, were the most prom-
inent borrowers in April, mostly taking uploans against borrowers’ notes and short-termcash advances from banks. Of the specialfunds, only the ERP Special Fund raised itslevel of indebtedness, albeit marginally. Thelocal authorities are likely to have increasedtheir total debt only slightly, too.
After the April decline, Federal Government
debt increased again in May, by slightly lessthan 32 billion. The Federal Government ex-
clusively tapped the capital market for thepurpose of financing its cash deficit, drawingfunds to the tune of almost 34
12billion net.
By contrast, the Federal Government cut itsmoney market borrowing further (by slightlymore than 32
12billion). The Federal Govern-
ment’s gross borrowing in the capital mar-ket even amounted to almost 314 billion,
just over 37 billion of which was procured
through bond issues. The tender of a 10-yearFederal bond alone yielded over 36 billion.

differ from those shown in the official financial statis-

sum. The Federal Government also acquiredloans against borrowers’ notes with a grossvalue of slightly more than 3
12billion. At al-
most 3912billion, Federal Government re-
demptions were likewise substantial, primar-ily involving Federal bonds (slightly more than33 billion) and five-year special Federal bonds
(just over 35 billion).
Securities markets
Bond marketThere was a further increase in sales in the
German bond market in April. German bor-rowers issued bonds to the value of 362.1billion compared with 355.9 billion in
March.
1Euro-denominated bonds accounted
for just over three-quarters of that amount.Net of redemptions, and after taking accountof changes in issuers’ holdings of their ownbonds, net sales in April came to 320.7 bil-
lion compared with 311.5 billion in March.
Two-thirds of the (net) amount of bonds soldhad maturities of more than four years. For-eign bonds worth 32.1 billion net were sold
in the German market. Purchases of paperdenominated in euro or Deutsche Mark ( 32.8
billion) were accompanied by renewed sellingof foreign currency bonds. Net sales of Ger-man and foreign bonds reached a total of322.8 billion in April compared with 317.9
billion a month earlier.
By far the greatest volume of German bonds
was issued by the credit institutions in April(317.6 billion). Communal bonds ( Öffent-
liche Pfandbriefe ) were in the forefront with a
value of 310.3 billion. Placements of bonds
issued by specialised credit institutions andmortgage bonds ( Hypothekenpfandbriefe )
amounted to 33.5 billion and 32.0 billion,
respectively. Market turnover in other bankbonds rose by 31.7 billion.
The public authorities increased their bond
market debt by 32.0 billion in April. The Fed-
eral Government raised 31.5 billion net from

The amount of ten-year Federal bonds out-standing declined by 31.7 billion.
2The Län-
der Governments’ bonded debt increased by30.6 billion.
Gross sales of Deutsche Mark/euro bonds is-
sued by non-residents under the lead man-agement of a German syndicate were muchsmaller, at 31.5 billion, in April than in March
(36.4 billion). After deduction of redemp-
tions, net sales amounted to 32.5 billion
compared with 30.3 billion in March.
Foreign investors dominated the buyers’ side
of the bond market in April when they in-creased their bond portfolios by 313.1 billion
and therefore by much the same amount asin the previous month ( 313.7 billion). They
purchased mostly paper issued by private bor-rowers ( 311.6 billion). The bonds held by
German credit institutions increased by 39.3
billion net in April; only German paper was in-volved. Net bond purchases by German non-banks amounted to 30.4 billion: foreign
bonds worth 32.2 billion were acquired and
German paper worth 31.8 billion was sold.
Equity marketGerman enterprises placed new shares worth
34.4 billion in the German equity market in
April compared with 31.9 billion in the previ-

Altogether, sales of German and foreignshares in the German equity market came to36.7 billion in April compared with 313.1
billion a month earlier.
German non-banks were the most important
group of investors in the German equity mar-ket in April. They increased their equity port-folios by 35.6 billion, 35.1 billion of this sum
being for German stock. German credit insti-tutions bought German shares worth 32.0

12Investment fund certificates
At37.1 billion, the amount raised by German
investment funds in April was somewhat lessthan in the previous month ( 37.9 billion).
While the specialised funds increased their in-vestible capital to 33.7 billion, funds open to
the general public experienced a fall in thesale of fund certificates from 35.0 billion to
33.4 billion. As in earlier months, share-
based funds received most of the capitalflowing into the funds open to the generalpublic ( 33.6 billion). Mixed funds and pen-
sion investment mutual funds ( Altersvorsor-
gefonds ) sold certificates worth 30.8 billion
and 30.1 billion, respectively. The bond-
based funds and money-market funds eachhad to redeem certificates totalling 30.7 bil-
lion (net). Open-end real estate funds record-ed outflows of 30.3 billion. In the case of the
specialised funds, the bond-based funds andthe share-based funds saw inflows of 31.7
billion and 31.6 billion, respectively; 30.1 bil-
lion accrued to the open-end real estatefunds. The outstanding amount of certificatesissued by the specialised funds operated asmoney-market funds remained unchanged inApril. Foreign investment fund certificatesworth 34.0 billion net were sold in the Ger-
man market. The total amount raised by salesof investment fund certificates thereforecame to 311.1 billion in April.
The investment fund certificates were bought
mainly by German non-banks in April ( 39.1
billion). The non-banks bought chiefly Ger-man certificates ( 35.0 billion). Credit institu-
tions’ holdings of investment fund certificatesincreased by 31.3 billion. Non-residents pur-chased certificates issued by German invest-
ment funds worth 30.7 billion (net).
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account – the combined
outcome of foreign trade, services, factor in-come and current transfers – ran a deficit of31.6 billion in April compared with a surplus
of33.0 billion in March. The surplus on trade
in goods was accompanied by a larger deficiton invisible current transactions.
According to calculations by the Federal Stat-
istical Office, the trade surplus, at 34.9 bil-
lion, was somewhat smaller than in March(35.5 billion). Germany’s exports of goods in
April were 3
12% down, seasonally adjusted,
on the – admittedly very high – level a monthearlier; in a two-month comparison exportsof goods increased by 4% in March-Aprilcompared with January-February. The figurefor imported goods also declined – in thiscase, by just over 3% – in April comparedwith the previous month, but the two-monthcomparison of imports likewise shows a 4%increase. The continuation of the generallyexpansionary underlying trend in foreigntrade is also clearly illustrated in a year-on-year comparison; the figure for exportedgoods in April 2000 was about 9% abovethat of the same month a year earlier whilethe rise in export prices amounted to 3%. Atjust over 12%, the year-on-year increase invalue on the import side was even more pro-nounced although this was primarily a reflec-tion of the rise in import prices, which hadSales of invest-

13risen by almost 10% in April compared with
the same month in 1999.
The overall deficit on invisible current transac-
tions with non-residents amounted to 36.2
billion in April; this means that it was muchlarger than in March this year ( 32.2 billion).
This development was due to a deteriorationin all sub-accounts. The deficit on factor in-come, which is subject to fairly sharp monthlyfluctuations, amounted to 30.1 billion in the
month under review. This compares with asurplus of 32.2 billion in March. The deficit
on service transactions with non-residentsrose to 33.6 billion (March: 32.7 billion). At
32.5 billion, the deficit on the sub-account
“Current transfers” was much more pro-nounced than in March ( 31.7 billion) because
larger German net contributions to the EUbudget played a major role here.
Cross-border capital flows moderated signifi-
cantly in April; in the previous two months amajor corporate takeover had inflated thestatistics on gross flows considerably. For thefirst time this year there were net capital im-ports (of 33.5 billion) in portfolio investment
during the month under review. Non-resi-dents invested 311.0 billion in the German
market, notably in domestic money marketpaper ( 37.9 billion) and in bonds and notes
(35.2 billion). On the equity market, by con-
trast, non-residents were net sellers (minus32.8 billion). German investors were less
interested in foreign securities in April ( 37.5
billion). They invested 34.0 billion in foreign
investment fund certificates, 31.5 billion in
shares and 31.0 billion in bonds and notes.Major items of the balance

14Direct investment resulted in net capital ex-
ports of 34.8 billion in April whereas in Feb-
ruary and March there had been substantialcapital inflows owing to the aforementionedcorporate takeover. German enterprises pro-vided their foreign subsidiaries with 38.2 bil-
lion in investible funds. Foreign firms, fortheir part, invested 33.4 billion in Germany.
Intra-group credit flows predominated inboth cases.
Appropriately, given the relatively small def-
icits on portfolio investment and direct invest-ment, non-securitised credit transactionswere almost in balance in April (plus 31.6 bil-
lion). While 30.3 billion flowed out of Ger-many as a result of the operations of enter-
prises and individuals, the net sum of 30.5
billion flowed into the country owing to thepublic sector’s withdrawal of funds from for-eign bank balances. In the case of Germancredit institutions there were net inflows of312.1 billion in the month under review –
primarily through the increase in the banks’short-term foreign liabilities. This was partlyoffset by the Bundesbank’s increasing assetbalances within the payment system TARGET.These are shown in the balance of paymentsas net capital exports ( 310.7 billion).

15Overall financial
flows in 1999In the following article the Deutsche
Bundesbank comments on financial ac-counts data which, for the first time,have been compiled across all sectorsin line with the European System ofNational and Regional Accounts (ESA’95) and which have been harmonisedwith the data of the Federal StatisticalOffice on capital formation and saving.The new concept results in severalmajor changes, especially with regardto the definition of the sectors and theclassification of financial instruments.One of the most significant revisions,in both quantitative and analyticalterms, concerns the institutional de-marcation between households andnon-financial corporations. As a result,the household sector – and also not-ably households’ saving ratio – is nowdefined more broadly, whereas enter-prises are defined more narrowly. Thishas the advantage that real economictransactions and financial transactionswhich are inherently related to one an-other are now attributed to the samedecision-maker. However, it has be-come harder to deduce the effects ofcapital formation on growth and em-ployment from the investment behav-iour of the corporate sector; these onlybecome apparent once the relevanttransactions of other investors, espe-cially households’ business and hous-ing activities, are also taken into ac-count.

16The German economy’s pattern of investment
and financing last year showed a markedoverall slackening – also measured on thebasis of the new methodology and system ofclassification
1– triggered by the financial
market crises in a number of important emer-ging economies. The momentum of foreigntrade, a mainstay of the German economy,weakened perceptibly in 1999 as a whole,and to some extent this acted as a brake ondomestic economic activity, too. Net fixedasset formation by non-financial corpor-ations
2and entrepreneurial households ex-
panded only moderately. By contrast, astronger economic impetus was provided onbalance by the persistently high level of stock-building, which thus had a stabilising effecton production. Moreover, the general gov-ernment sector increased its investmentbudgets slightly following years of spendingcuts, while the adjustment pressure on thehousing construction sector eased.
Overall, domestic financing requirements for
the acquisition of new fixed assets and inven-tories increased distinctly. This was accom-panied, however, by lower domestic saving asthe sluggish pace of business activity andhigher costs led to a deterioration of enter-prises’ earnings while household saving con-tinued to decrease in the context of high un-employment. This cancelled out the easing ofthe pressure on financial markets stemming,in particular, from the reduction of the gov-ernment budget deficit. This divergence be-tween the demand for domestic financingand the supply of savings again resulted lastyear in a wider national financing gap, whichwas closed unproblematically through fundsfrom abroad – albeit at considerably higher
capital market rates. Despite the changes inthe interest rate environment, the prevailingterms of financing provided a favourablebasis for the upturn in economic activity lastyear, particularly as the equity market playeda larger role in the overall pattern of finan-cing.
Domestic acquisition of fixed assets
In 1999 the resources required for the acquisi-
tion of fixed assets in Germany totalledDM 284 billion, which was around 7% morethan in 1998. A major factor in this was theincreased net investment in machinery, equip-ment and operating software by non-finan-cial corporations and quasi-corporations,whereas expenditure on industrial and com-mercial buildings, which is generally associ-ated with business extensions, continued todecline – albeit at a considerably slower ratethan in the previous years – in the light ofrelatively low capacity utilisation. Overall, en-terprises’ acquisition of fixed assets wastherefore only slightly higher (in price-adjust-ed terms) than a year before. As in 1998, itamounted to around 3% of the aggregatedisposable income of all sectors. Consequent-ly, the sectoral net capital formation ratio re-mained below the level achieved in 1993(3
12%).

18Expenditure on inventories increased consid-
erably in 1999. In addition to a speculativerise in the stockbuilding of raw materials andintermediate products, larger stocks of fin-ished products are also likely to have accumu-lated owing to sales difficulties. According tothe estimates of the Federal Statistical Office,total spending on inventories amounted toDM 47 billion in 1999. This represented ayear-on-year increase of around 60%. The re-sulting financing requirements amounted toabout half the volume of funds which enter-prises invested in fixed assets. These propor-tions clearly raise doubts as to whether firms’pattern of stockbuilding is correctly capturedin the statistics.
In addition to non-financial corporations and
financial institutions, the general governmentsector, too, raised its investment expenditureslightly in 1999. This applies especially to theFederal Government, which substantially in-creased its expenditure on tangible fixedassets, evidently in connection with the trans-fer of the seat of government from Bonn toBerlin. The acquisition of assets by generalgovernment was additionally boosted by theimproved fiscal situation of the local author-ities in western Germany, which, following alengthy period of investment restraint,stepped up their acquisition of tangible fixedassets. By contrast, households’ investmentactivities, more than two-thirds of which re-late to housing, slackened further. The grow-ing preference in western Germany for pur-chasing owner-occupied houses was morethan offset by the declining demand forapartments for letting. Moreover, self-employed persons and sole proprietors, whoare now allocated in their entirety (i.e. includ-
ing their entrepreneurial activities) to thehousehold sector, were just as hesitant as thecorporations with respect to business invest-ment. As a result, the amount invested byhouseholds in 1999 in the acquisition of fixedassets, at just under DM 137 billion, againshowed a year-on-year fall, thereby furtherlowering households’ net capital formationratio to around 4% of the aggregate dispos-able income of all domestic sectors.
National supply of savings
In contrast to the growing financing require-
ments for capital formation, the national sup-ply of savings declined by 3% last year toDM 252 billion. Much of this decrease wasdue to the deteriorating earnings of non-financial corporations, which either saw theirturnover affected, directly or indirectly, by theworsening of the global economic climate orelse, as in the case of the construction sector,had not yet completed their structural adjust-ment. But even in growth industries thatwere formerly subject to strict regulation, in-creased competition is likely to have led tomarked falls in earnings. For example, thenumber of providers of telecommunicationservices increased by one-third in the courseof 1999 to a total of around 1,700 firms. Asimilar trend was discernible in the case of en-terprises that entered the market in high-techsectors with a promising future but were notyet able to achieve a sufficient profit.
On the expenditure side, cost pressures in-
creased because, on average, wage settle-

19ments exceeded labour productivity growth
in real terms. In addition, higher interest andtax burdens diminished operating results. Fi-nally, enterprises also faced higher purchaseprices for raw materials and energy. As non-financial corporations had little room to raisetheir own prices, their profits declined by al-most 6% last year compared with 1998, al-though admittedly that year had been char-acterised by high corporate profitability.Measured in terms of output, the earningsratio of 8
12% that was achieved in 1999 was
still clearly above the average of the previousyears. If the relatively high dividend paymentsand the transfers to provisions for companypensions are subtracted from this amount, re-tained profits (including net capital transfersreceived) were actually negative.
At the same time, households’ level of sav-
ings continued to decrease. Their investiblefunds, which comprise current savings plusgrants awarded in connection with govern-ment saving promotion schemes, declined in1999 to DM 269 billion. As a percentage ofthe aggregate disposable income of all sec-tors, households’ supply of savings fell to8
14%, compared with 1012% in 1991. By
contrast, domestic saving was boosted by theimproved operating results of financial institu-tions and, in particular, by the fact that theshortfall between the general governmentsector’s current receipts and its expenditureon consumption and transfers (as defined inthe national accounts) narrowed further. Thiswas attributable not just to the fiscal consoli-dation policy but also to special factors. Taxrevenue, for example, was more plentiful(despite weaker economic growth), inter aliaowing to higher energy taxation and the ex-
piry of tax depreciation allowances for invest-ment in eastern Germany. Of the variouslevels of government, the Federal Govern-ment and the Länder Governments furtherreduced their negative savings contribution,while the social security funds recorded evenhigher surpluses than a year before.
Basic pattern of the financial flows
Comparing the acquisition of fixed assets and
saving, it can be seen that the economy’soverall pattern of investment and financingwas characterised above all by a sharp in-crease in the external financing requirementsof the corporate sector. The funding gap ofnon-financial corporations increased by abouthalf last year to reach DM 143 billion. Theconsequence of this was their relatively heavyrecourse to external resources amounting to4
12% of the aggregate disposable income of
all sectors, which, together with net govern-ment borrowing, exceeded the domestic sup-ply of funds available from those sectorswhich had generated a surplus. Around four-fifths of the total external financing require-ments of the business and government sec-tors were met by domestic sources of funds;one-fifth, or just over DM 30 billion, was ob-tained abroad.
As in 1998, the expansion of economic activ-
ity last year went hand in hand with intensiveefforts by corporations to improve their prof-itability and market capitalisation in order tobe able to hold their own in global competi-tion. Financial flows were once more boostedNegative

20considerably by financial transactions con-
nected with the reorientation of firms’ fieldsof business and the concentration on corecompetencies. This process was acceleratedby takeovers, mergers and alliances (some ofthem cross-border) aimed not only at gainingaccess to new technologies, products andmarkets but also at achieving and concentrat-ing synergy effects. As preliminary steps ofsuch strategic moves, corporations frequentlyspun off business units into autonomouslegal entities which were then listed on thestock exchange. This gave enterprises thechance to acquire an additional “acquisitioncurrency” for a stronger global orientation.Other expansionary influences were exertedon the volume of financial flows in the Ger-man economy in 1999 by transactions relat-ing to the treasury operations of globally ac-tive enterprises and by the fact that the intro-duction of the euro appears to have strength-ened Germany’s position as the euro area’s fi-nancial hub. Such a large increase in financialinvestment and its concomitant financing –measured in terms of GDP – was last seen atthe time of the boom triggered by Germanunification.
Last year shares featured more prominently
than before in the selection of investmentand financing instruments even though yieldson longer-term bonds increased distinctly andthe German stock market for a long timelagged behind the worldwide surge in shareprices.

21taken into account, the proportion rises to al-
most two-fifths, compared with around 30%in 1998 and about 10% at the beginning ofthe nineties. Most sought after were sharesof companies active in the technology, mediaand telecommunications (TMT) sectors,which incorporate the possibilities presentedby the digital revolution most graphically.Shares likewise gained further ground lastyear as financing instruments. In 1999 sharesand other equity accounted for around one-eighth of the total external funding of the do-mestic non-financial sectors, twice as muchas in 1991. If the loans granted by foreignfirms to their German affiliates are included,equity financing accounted for an even great-er weight. This increased investment in riskcapital occurred chiefly at the expense of do-mestic banks, which had hitherto been at thecentre of the financing cycle. In 1999 the do-mestic non-financial sectors augmented theirbank balances by only one-third as much asthey had done in 1998. Similarly, borrowingfrom domestic credit institutions likewise de-clined by around one-quarter in 1999 despitethe higher overall demand for funds. House-holds, corporations and government metonly around 40% of their additional fundingrequirements via banks, compared with ashare of more than half in 1998.
Households’ saving and borrowing
behaviour
The overall downward trend in German
households’ saving evident since the begin-ning of the nineties continued in 1999. Thevolume of savings accumulated by house-holds, which in line with ESA ’95 now also in-
cludes savings accruing from the private ren-tal of residential property and from the entre-preneurial activities of self-employed personsand sole proprietors, fell slightly below the1998 level. Accordingly, the saving ratio as apercentage of households’ disposable incomealso declined, dropping to just under 10%,whereas in the year of German unificationhouseholds had managed to save betweenone-seventh and one-eighth of their dispos-able income.
Current savings, which also include govern-
ment transfers received in connection withsaving promotion schemes, fund around two-thirds of households’ asset acquisition andthus represent their main source of finance.Based on the new method of calculation,the remaining one-third – which in 1999amounted to an estimated DM 144 billion – isaccounted for by the incurrence of liabilitiesfor financing the acquisition of residentialproperty, business activities and other pur-poses. Despite problems of statistical record-ing, it can be assumed that the demand forprivate building loans, in particular, remainedhigh in view of the sustained preference for a“home of one’s own”. Moreover, in the lightof the upturn in automobile sales in thespring and summer of 1999, borrowing byhouseholds to finance car purchases presum-ably also rose last year. The “run” on shareswas probably also partly financed via borrow-ing; this appears to have been the case, inparticular, for shares bought through directbanks. By contrast, credit demand for theconstruction of flats for rental and for the ac-

22quisition of fixed assets by self-employed per-
sons appears to have been fairly moderate.
At a total of DM 413 billion, households mo-
bilised less funds for the acquisition of fixedand financial assets in 1999 than a year earl-ier. However, this overall trend masks diver-gent developments in the individual compon-ents of asset acquisition. For example, the re-covery of domestic business activity sincemid-1999 appears to have motivated self-employed persons and sole proprietors to in-vest somewhat larger amounts in machinery,equipment and inventories, a trend whichwas reinforced by purchases of new softwareto avoid possible computer problems associ-ated with the millennium date change. Innominal terms, gross capital formation in thisfield was 8
12% higher in 1999 than a yearearlier. The interest of west Germans in ac-
quiring owner-occupied housing also re-mained strong. That is indicated, inter alia, by
the higher amount of construction permitsand completions of one and two-familyhouses, which were primarily acquired byhouseholds.
3Part of this extra demand may
have been due to the bringing-forward ofpurchase intentions, given rising interest ratesand the lowering, at the start of 1999, of theincome ceiling for qualifying for a govern-ment home-building grant. However, thiswas more than counterbalanced by the factthat the demand from households for otherconstruction work continued to decline. Thusthe construction of owner-occupied flats andapartments intended for rental decreased,owing to the saturation of the market inmany regions, as did households’ construc-tion projects for business purposes. After tak-ing account of the consumption of fixed cap-ital, households spent DM 137 billion, or5
12% of their disposable income, on the
acquisition of fixed assets last year, which wasslightly less than in 1998.
In 1999 households acquired financial assets
to the amount of DM 277 billion. The choiceof investment vehicles was chiefly determinedby the expected rate of return, but uncer-tainty surrounding future interest rate andshare price trends, fears in connection withthe changeover to the year 2000 and low op-portunity costs also led to an increased pref-erence for liquidity.

a large number of young, innovative com-panies listed on the Neuer Markt. Moreover,
merger rumours spurred investors’ fantasiesin many cases. The attractiveness of shareswas additionally enhanced by governmentmoves to improve benefits under the GermanPersonal Asset Acquisition Act (introduced atthe beginning of 1999) and, in particular, bythe halving of the tax-free allowance for per-sonal savings from January 1, 2000, in antici-pation of which substantial portfolio shiftsprobably occurred.
Households placed an estimated DM 86 bil-
lion in shares and share-based mutual fundslast year. This was half as much again as in1998 and accounted for more than 30% ofhouseholds’ total acquisition of financialassets, compared with around one-fifth in1998. They favoured equities of firms domi-ciled in the euro area and Europe in general,focusing on the pharmaceutical, media, tele-communications, biotechnology and informa-tion technology sectors. This sustained prefer-ence for investing in shares has meanwhileled to a steep increase in households’ mutualfunds holdings as well as to a perceptibleshift in the profile of their holdings. Almosthalf of the assets held by households in suchmutual funds are currently invested in share-
based funds; this proportion has almosttripled since the beginning of the nineties.
Households also purchased more shares in
real estate funds, bond-based funds andmoney market funds. Three times as muchmoney was invested alone in domestic realestate funds open to the general public in1999 as a year earlier, which contrasts sharplyas % of disposable income

25with the saturated German housing market.
Investment companies therefore increasinglyhad to seek lucrative properties abroad. As aresult, households achieved an internationaldiversification of their portfolios which wasfavourable both in terms of yields and taxsavings.
4
Besides the acquisition of equities and mutualfunds shares, households also placed more re-sources with insurance corporations. This canbe attributed to a combination of various fac-tors. The main insurance investment vehicleremained saving via life assurance schemes,which accounted for almost two-thirds. Forsome time now, the ongoing debate on thestatutory pension insurance schemes hasbeen highlighting the need for households tomake supplementary private old-age pensionprovision. The tax debates also helped boostlife assurance companies’ new business,which expanded at double-digit rates in1999. As in the past years, growth wasfuelled by policies with one-time contribu-tions by the policy holder, chiefly pension in-surance schemes entailing the immediatestart of annuity payments. Life assurancecompanies were thus, in part, able to “recu-perate” payments disbursed on matured con-tracts or to attract funds from households’portfolio shifts.
By contrast, a lower amount of funds was
placed with banks and savings and loan asso-ciations. It totalled just under DM 20 billionlast year, which was only one-quarter of theamount invested in 1998. Specifically, this de-velopment can be attributed to outflows offunds from time deposits and saving depositsas well as to the maturing of numerous sav-
ings certificates. At the same time, liquidityholdings expanded over twelve months toreach almost DM 60 billion, inter alia owing
to the precautionary hoarding of cash on theeve of the millennium change. Householdsshowed restraint in placing funds in the bondmarket, where new investment probably onlyslightly exceeded the redemptions and pre-mature resales by means of which holderssought to forestall the danger of price losseson old bonds in the wake of the perceptiblerise in interest rates.
According to the new method of calculation,
households’ gross financial assets amountedto DM 6
34trillion at the end of 1999, which
was almost twice as much as in 1990. Thiscorresponds to an average annual increase of7
12%. Around three-quarters of this increase
was attributable to households’ “financialsaving”, while slightly less than one-quarterwas accounted for by upward revaluations(including errors and omissions in statisticalrecording), which amounted to a cumulativetotal of around DM 700 billion in absoluteterms. The value gains accruing to financialassets were chiefly attributable to shares, asstock market quotations – measured by thebroadly based CDAX index – have approxi-mately tripled since 1990. Hence savers whoinvested their funds in shares were the main
4By contrast, the curbing of tax depreciation allowances
and loss-offsetting facilities – according to external esti-
mates – led to a further decrease in households’ invest-
ment in closed-end real estate funds in 1999. These in-
vestment vehicles, which in good years reputedly record-
ed annual inflows of funds of almost DM 20 billion, were
hitherto not included in the financial accounts. The re-
straint shown by households towards tax-saving forms of
asset acquisition may have benefited the open-end real
estate funds.Funds placed

26beneficiaries of the accumulated holding
gains, which, however, were probably distrib-uted very unevenly among the individualhouseholds in view of the irregular dispersionof share ownership.
However, German households’ holding gains
remained distinctly lower than in other coun-tries, where capital gains on financial assetsaccounted for up to four-fifths of the expan-sion of households’ financial assets, as was
the case in the United States. Understandably,savers may be greatly tempted in such casesto regard most of the value increases as beingpermanent and hence to consider them asubstitute for “genuine saving”, and this con-fidence may influence their spending behav-iour. If – contrary to the usual practice in thenational accounts – German households’holding gains are counted both towards theirsaving and towards their disposable income,this results in an average annual savingequivalent (in purely arithmetical terms)throughout the nineties of 3% of their“broadly defined income”. In other words,on balance the upward revaluation of secur-ities portfolios more than offset the negativeimpact on asset growth of the decline in thesaving ratio. In the United States, by compari-son, households’ average annual holdinggains amounted to one-quarter of their ad-justed income over the same period, whilethe saving ratio declined from 8
14% in 1990
to 214% in 1999.
Investment and financing behaviour of
non-financial corporations
In 1999, non-financial corporations’ capital
formation was characterised by contrastinginfluences. On the one hand, perturbations inthe global economic environment and theneed for structural adjustment dampened thepropensity to invest in the industries affected,while in other areas the upturn in economicactivity stimulated capital formation. Accord-ingly, corporate investment showed a mixedpicture. Capital formation again rose primar-%

27ily in western Germany, especially in the in-
novative or less export-sensitive branches ofthe industrial and service sectors. In easternGermany, by contrast, enterprises – with theexception of manufacturers of machinery andequipment and of motor vehicles – continuedto curtail their investment budgets to a “nor-mal level” in the medium term. The results ofa survey by the ifo institute indicate that in-
vestment expenditure in the east Germanmanufacturing sector declined by 7% in1999.
5At the same time, housing associ-
ations in eastern Germany increasingly had tocontend with a high number of unlet proper-ties which dented earnings and inhibited in-vestment. In Germany as a whole, the grossacquisition of fixed assets and inventories bycorporations amounted to DM 468 billion in1999, which was almost 6% higher than ayear earlier. The greater part of this increase –nearly 60% – was used for additional stock-building.
In the case of enterprises faced with global
challenges, expenditure on fixed assets at lo-cations in Germany mirrors only one side oftheir multifaceted investment strategy. Therisks connected with the planning and ap-proval of new plants, the development of im-proved processes and innovative productsand their political and social acceptance inthe domestic market are all reasons why en-terprises often opt for external growth by ac-quiring existing companies or participatinginterests instead of establishing or expandingtheir own production plants. This is the fast-est way for globally active enterprises toachieve a broadly based, solid position in theglobal market and hence to become a globalplayer. In 1999 non-financial corporations
spent DM 134 billion on this strategy, a largeproportion of which was accounted for bydirect investment in the European telecom-munications market. If the additional financialand trade credits to branches and partner%

28firms abroad are also taken into account, the
figure rises to DM 205 billion; that was dis-tinctly higher than the already appreciablesum which German firms invested in 1998. Inthis way non-financial corporations chan-nelled more than four-fifths of their newly ac-quired financial assets in 1999 into such“global investments”. The corresponding fig-ure for the nineties as a whole is DM 650 bil-lion, or just over half of firms’ financial assetacquisition over the same period.
In addition, non-financial corporations sub-
stantially built up their liquid reserves lastyear. This occurred primarily via the acquisi-tion of short-term bank debt securities,
6
whose yield advantage over comparable timedeposits increased throughout the year.Moreover, domestic liquid deposits were alsobuilt up, possibly in connection with the moreattractive interest rate conditions offered bydomestic banks now that minimum reservesearn the same remuneration throughout theeuro area. On the other hand, enterprisesperceptibly reduced their balances with for-eign banks and their portfolios of moneymarket instruments and money marketfunds. It is likely that the extra resources heldas liquidities were primarily funds accruingfrom the sale of companies or participatinginterests in the wake of strategic restructuringmeasures, which often yielded substantialextraordinary income.
Non-financial corporations’ total investments
in non-financial and financial assetsamounted to DM 704 billion in 1999. As a re-sult, their financing requirements were 4
12%
higher than in 1998, when they had alreadybeen sizeable. Corporations’ internally gener-
ated resources from retained profits, depreci-ation allowances and government investmentgrants concurrently declined by around 7%last year. This amount sufficed to finance lessthan half of the increase in total assets, com-pared with 52% in 1998 and a ratio of al-most two-thirds in the years 1994-7, whenenterprises had generally exercised great re-straint in their expenditure on tangible fixedassets despite improved profitability. Non-financial corporations’ external financing re-quirements thus rose substantially last year.
In order to secure a sufficiently broad finan-
cial base to cope with the risks on the growthmarkets and to carry out their strategic re-orientations, enterprises increasingly soughtto procure additional equity capital. Althoughthe data concerning domestic share sales inthe financial accounts for 1998 were inflatedby a merger between a German and a foreignenterprise in the car industry, the volume ofequity issues remained quite high last yeardespite the rather muted development ofshare prices until autumn and the uncertaintywith respect to the plans for economic policyreforms. Around one-third of all newly issuedshares were initial public offerings (IPOs).Firms also raised considerable amounts offunds in the form of other equity and credits
6Owing to distortions in the base statistics that may
have occurred in connection with the changeover of stat-
istical concepts on account of the introduction of the
euro or simply owing to reporting errors, the financial ac-
counts figures for 1999 are subject to some statistical un-
certainty which currently cannot be eliminated satisfac-
torily. This particularly concerns the sale and distribution
of bonds. The sharp decline in enterprises’ other claims
on residents should thus probably be regarded as an ad-
justment counterpart to their excessively high acquisition
of securities.Rise in liquidity

30from foreign subsidiaries, in which a merger
in the chemical industry played an importantrole. Overall, non-financial corporations fi-nanced DM 430 billion of their acquisition ofnon-financial and financial assets last yearthrough internally generated resources plusown funds raised via the market; this equals aratio of just over 60%, which was actuallyless than in 1998.
Besides the relatively high level of external
funding through equity, direct borrowing byfirms also increased perceptibly. They showeda predilection for foreign banks, as the elimin-ation of exchange rate risk and the conver-gence of the interest rate level apparentlyboosted borrowing in other euro area coun-tries. Moreover, part of new borrowingabroad was presumably linked to cross-border mergers and other capital links. Cor-porations took up more loans from domesticbanks, too, especially longer-term loanswhich are typically used for financing capitalformation and the acquisition of participatinginterests. Among the principal borrowerswere sectors with longer-term investmentand modernisation programmes (e.g. trans-port and housing enterprises) and firms ingrowth areas – or their financial backers. Bycontrast, short-term bank liabilities declined,especially in manufacturing and trade, whichat first sight appears to contradict the marked
rise in inventories. The enterprises procuredthe funds they needed for their stockbuildingactivities by extending their payment periodsto foreign suppliers, via the money marketand also, in part, out of their own liquid re-serves.
Thanks to the abundant supply of funds in
the domestic and foreign financial markets,non-financial corporations were able to meettheir financing requirements in 1999 relativelyeasily and on reasonable terms. However,tensions could arise within the current macro-economic constellation if households’ pro-pensity to save remains low and governmentfails to pursue its course of fiscal consolida-tion rigorously and lastingly. Improving theprofitability of the business sector remains akey requirement. The planned tax relief meas-ures benefiting enterprises are a step in theright direction. The evident progress that hasbeen made on the labour market and thewage settlements for 2000 and 2001, to-gether with the persistently temperate priceclimate, have created favourable conditionsfor a harmonious balance in the Germaneconomy – and one that is conducive togrowth – between investment needs andavailable financing.

31Revision of the financial accounts in line with the new European System of Accounts
(ESA’95)*
The financial accounts drawn up by the Deutsche Bundes-
bank, which are an integral part of Germany’s system of na-
tional accounts, have now also been revised in line with
ESA ’95, which is binding on all EU member states. 1The
adoption of this new definitional framework not only en-
sures consistency with the national accounts relating to the
real economy but also improves the international compar-
ability of the results, in particular regarding the investment
and lending or borrowing behaviour of the different sec-
tors of the economy. The changes vis-à-vis the former na-
tional system mainly concern the breakdown and defin-
ition of the different sectors and instruments.
As explained in the main article, the reclassification of the
domestic non-financial sectors represents a focal point of
the revision. The new sector non-financial corporations now
solely comprises genuine corporations and so-called quasi-
corporations (principally partnerships such as general part-
nerships ( Offene Handelsgesellschaft – OHG ) and limited
partnerships ( Kommanditgesellschaft – KG )). By contrast,
sole proprietors and self-employed persons, whose entre-
preneurial activities are legally indistinguishable from the
transactions of private individuals, are classified as belong-
ing to the household sector. The same applies to purchasers
of private residential property, the strongest group of in-
vestors within the housing sector, which in the past was
treated as a sub-sector of non-financial enterprises. As a con-
sequence of the broadening of the household concept, the
sector’s saving ratio is now lower than before the reclassifi-
cation. This is due, above all, to depreciation of households’
fixed assets to take account of losses of value caused by
wear and tear. This tendency is reinforced by the relatively
high degree of external financing of business investments.
The institutional classification in the household sector re-
sults in a balance sheet extension in the financial accounts.
Households’ financial asset acquisition now includes the
commercial deposits of self-employed persons. In addition
to consumer credit, household liabilities now also embrace
housing loans and loans taken up by self-employed persons
and sole proprietors to finance the acquisition of fixed
assets.
By contrast, the general government sector is now defined
somewhat more narrowly than before because the supple-
mentary pension funds for government employees are no
longer included under the sub-sector social security funds
but instead – like the legally autonomous pension funds of
private-sector employers – under the sector insurance cor-
porations and pension funds. As a result, households’ ac-
quisition of financial assets with insurance corporations
now tends to be higher.
The new classification of the banking sector accords with
the ECB’s definition of “monetary financial institutions”
(MFIs), which comprise the Deutsche Bundesbank, the do-
mestic credit institutions (including savings and loan associ-
ations) and money market funds. The sector other financial
intermediaries currently only comprises other open-end
mutual funds (securities-based funds, open-end real estate
funds and dedicated pension funds) as statistics on other fi-
nancial institutions such as closed-end real estate funds are
not available at present.In the financing matrix, the definitions of financial instru-
ments are generally independent of the creditor or debtor
sectors involved. Therefore, the different categories of de-
posits now also comprise the balances of domestic sectors
with foreign banks (especially transferable deposits and
time deposits). Moreover, the item loans includes not only
bank loans but also non-securitised lending by other sec-
tors (e.g. mortgages and other loans granted by insurance
corporations or general government). In addition, the list
of financial instruments has been extended in two import-
ant respects to enable the separate recording of financial
derivatives and of other equity (other than shares).
Financial derivatives are financial instruments based on or
derived from another instrument which allow special risks
to be traded separately from the underlying instrument.
The underlying instrument can be, for example, another
financial asset (e.g. options on securities), an index (e.g.
DAX futures) or a commodity (e.g. commodity futures). At
present, only the balance of payments statistics provide
data on cross-border net payments in connection with op-
tions and other financial derivatives, although these data
provide no details on the domestic counterparties involved
in these transactions. No data are available on such trans-
actions between domestic counterparties.
In line with ESA ’95, the item shares and other equity in
the financial accounts comprises not only shares but also
participating interests in other corporations (particularly
private limited companies ( GmbHs )) and partnerships. Al-
though such enterprises account for a substantial amount
of equity capital in Germany, it was previously impossible,
for statistical reasons, to record such other equity in the fi-
nancial accounts. 2Using data derived from the corporate
balance sheet statistics compiled by the Deutsche Bundes-
bank plus additional data from the banking and balance
of payments statistics, a first attempt has been made to es-
timate the own funds raised by enterprises other than pub-
lic limited companies. The results are very tentative and
merely provide a somewhat more comprehensive picture
of the overall level of equity financing in Germany.
Claims on insurance corporations comprise (contingent)
claims of policy holders which are mirrored in the balance
sheets of insurance corporations and pension funds by cor-
responding insurance technical reserves. The item claims
arising from company pension commitments comprises
company-based direct pension commitments, which are
widespread in Germany (according to ESA ’95 these are
likewise to be classified as claims arising from insurance
technical reserves).
The item other accounts receivable/payable comprises
claims and liabilities that tend to be counterparts of other
business activities, e.g. early or late payments for goods
and services. This item includes enterprises’ trade credits
and prepayments/accrued income as well as government
tax claims and payment arrears (e.g. in connection with in-
voice settlement for public buildings).

desbank will reclassify its financial assets and liabilities ac-
counts, the results of which are to be submitted to the

43Trends in local
authority financesince themid-ninetiesThe financial position of the local au-
thorities underwent a reversal in themid-nineties: whereas in the first halfof the preceding decade the local au-thorities recorded large deficits,
1they
achieved surpluses in each of the lasttwo years. However, since substantialdifferences continue to exist betweenthe western and the eastern Länder,and between the individual municipal-ities of a single Land, the financial bal-ance, which is positive on the whole,cannot be taken as representative of agenerally relaxed budgetary situation.The following report analyses thetrend in local authority finance, payingparticular attention to the process ofharmonisation between the local au-thorities in east and west Germany. In-structive commentary is made difficultby the fact that more and more amen-ities are being removed from local au-thority core budgets; as a result, the in-formative value of the correspondingfinancial statistics is quite limited. Thisis especially true of major receipts andexpenditure items, whereas the finan-cial balance is less vulnerable to distor-tions resulting from this trend. A separ-ate section is given over to an in-depthanalysis of the ensuing problems.

44Overall trend in local authority finance
In 1995 the budgets of the local authorities2
were still showing a deficit – at that time
amounting to DM 1412billion – after expend-
iture had exceeded receipts by more thanDM 10 billion in each of the preceding threeyears. Thus consolidation pressures had builtup that were further aggravated in thenext two years by a decline in receipts. As aresult, the local authorities were obliged toadopt economising measures. Expendituredecreased in absolute terms and in 1999 was,at DM 283
12billion, 5% less than in 1995
(although it should be borne in mind that theextent of the decrease is considerably over-stated owing to the outsourcing of municipalamenities). As a result, the deficits had beennarrowed rapidly. Indeed in each of the lasttwo years an astonishingly large surplus ofjust over DM 5 billion was recorded. Duringthose years receipts grew at an unexpectedlyfast pace, given the decline of the precedingyears. For all that, the total revenue figure for1999 was only slightly larger than that for1995, i.e. by just under 1
12%. (The various
types of receipts and expenditure are listed in-dividually in the table on page 47).
Still, the public finance trend for Germany as
a whole gives only a general impressionbased on average values, which must be sup-plemented by the drawing of more subtle dis-tinctions. The local authorities in western andeastern Germany, for example, did not reducetheir deficits to the same extent. The old Län-der showed significant improvement in theirfinancial positions, having started with a def-icit of just over DM 12 billion in 1995 andhaving closed each of the last two years of
the decade with surpluses of more than DM 5billion. The budgetary situation of the localauthorities in the new Länder also improved,but here the improvement was not asmarked. As of last year, they were still run-ning a deficit (approximately DM
12billion)
compared with a financing gap of DM 2 bil-lion in 1995.
Not only do significant differences exist be-
tween east and west Germany but even with-in individual Länder the financial positions ofthe local authorities may vary considerably.DM

45Special features of local authority budget law
The budget plans of the local authorities discrimin-
ate more carefully between items relating to day-to-day operations and items relating to assets andliabilities than do the Federal or Länder budgetplans. Current receipts and expenditure are shownin the administrative budget. It is here that re-ceipts from taxes, fees and charges, and transfersfrom other levels of government that are not re-stricted to capital expenditure are recorded, aswell as personnel expenditure, other operating ex-penditure, social benefits, other current grantsand interest paid. Clearing items relating to capitalbudget entries and shortfalls in the administrativebudgets of previous years are to be listed here,too. The capital budget, by contrast, consists of re-ceipts and expenditure that affect the size of amunicipality’s assets or liabilities. These include, onthe receipts side, investment grants from the Fed-eral Government and the Länder Governments,road and connection contributions, asset sales,borrowing, and withdrawals from capital reservesas well as, on the expenditure side, capital forma-tion, lending, investment grants, the acquisition ofparticipating interests, and redemptions of out-standing debt. Items that are cleared against eachother in the two budgets are to be posted in thecapital budget as contra-entries to the entries ap-pearing in the administrative budget.
Local authority budget law stipulates that the ad-
ministrative budget show a surplus that is at leastpractically equivalent to the volume of funds re-quired to redeem outstanding debt. This amountis to be transferred to the capital budget; borrow-ing is only possible within the latter’s framework.Approval by the municipal supervisory board,which is mandatory in most Länder, presupposesconfirmation that sufficient funds are available tofinance debt service over the long term. If loansraised for investment purposes cannot be refi-nanced completely and direct through fees andcharges or through contributions, the local au-thorities will often resort to certain “available fi-nancial balances”. This term refers to the amountsby which net transfers from the administrative tothe capital budget exceed the minimum transferamount prescribed by budget law.In the past few years, many district-independent
cities have had difficulties in generating theamounts needed for minimum transfers to thecapital budget on the basis of current receiptsalone.
1If this is not feasible, proceeds from
asset sales and withdrawals from capital reservesmay also be used for the purpose of restockingthe administrative budget. Such transfers to theadministrative budget may be construed as asign of a difficult budgetary situation. If eventhese transactions fail to provide the administra-tive budget with the necessary funding, a short-fall must be shown in the annual accounts. If, inthe course of drawing up the administrativebudget, it already becomes apparent that thebudget cannot be financed in the statutorily re-quired way, this is a case of “uncovered expend-iture”. In most Länder, a budget that has beenso designated will not receive the municipalsupervisory board’s approval or, if so, only oncompliance with strict guidelines for budgetmanagement that have been set up by theboard itself. Deficits in the administrativebudget must not be financed by means of regu-lar loans but must be bridged through cash ad-vances. A shortfall in the administrative budgetmust be entered as a current expenditure itemin the second budget following the shortfall, atthe very latest, to ensure that it can be coveredby normal receipts. Thus, through its restrictiveprovisions governing borrowing and the re-demption of loans, local authority budget lawimposes relatively severe constraints on themanagement of public funds.
The restrictive provisions of local authority
budget law ensure that, in principle, loans takenup for the purpose of financing investment arerepaid from ordinary receipts and thus preventthe kind of asset depletion that Federal Govern-ment and Länder Government budget law makepossible by allowing for unlimited access to fol-low-up financing in the credit market. In sodoing, local budget law also helps ensure thatlocal authorities will realise the objective of theStability and Growth Pact, which stipulates that,over the medium term, budgetary positions beclose to balance or in surplus.

46Whereas in Hesse, for example, the city of
Frankfurt am Main was able to record a sur-plus of almost DM 900 million last year ac-cording to the quarterly cash statistics, otherdistrict-independent cities finished the yearwith deficits of up to DM 60 million. In nu-merous German municipalities, where tradetax receipts, in particular, have risen only neg-ligibly over the last few years and social assist-ance benefits represent an above-averageburden, the financial situation remains so crit-ical that it is no longer possible for them toachieve the administrative budget surplusesmandated by local authority budget law.In such cases comprehensive consolidationmeasures continue to be necessary (see theexplanation on page 45).Still, the persistently unfavourable budgetary
situation of numerous municipalities is, initself, no reason to demand a broad-basedimprovement in the financial position of thelocal authorities. Instead, it would be moreappropriate to consider whether additionalfunds should be granted to especially hard-hitmunicipalities as part of the municipal rev-enue equalisation scheme. Insofar as thiswould entail an increase in the funds avail-able for revenue equalisation, it would haveto be examined whether – apart from theLand involved – financially strong municipal-ities might not be able to contribute funding.The siphoning off of tax receipts involved inthe equalisation scheme may, however, havethe effect of weakening the municipalities’incentive to cultivate their own tax revenuesources. Thus such equalisation mechanismsare subject to relatively narrow limits.
Several factors have contributed to the overall
reversal in the financial position of the localauthorities. A significant easing of the finan-cial burden is attributable to the introductionof the statutory nursing care insurancescheme, which from July 1996 on alsoawards persons in need of institutional care aclaim to financial assistance. The high costsassociated with nursing home facilities hadoften exhausted the income of the personsaffected, ultimately culminating in a claim tosocial assistance benefits that had to be re-deemed by institutions funded mainly by thelocal authorities. Up until 1995, this expend-iture item, in particular, had increased verysharply, with annual growth rates of usuallymore than 10%.

47trend could be reversed. This was the main
reason that in 1999 expenditure on social as-sistance to persons living in institutions was,at DM 18
12billion, less than that in 1995 by
more than DM 8 billion. This decline was, inturn, responsible for the fact that the localauthorities’ total expenditure on social bene-fits decreased significantly during this period.
Besides the decline in the number of persons
seeking political asylum, this may also be at-tributed to the efforts of numerous local au-thorities to provide unemployed persons re-ceiving social assistance with jobs which en-title them to payments from the Federal La-bour Office. The result of these endeavourswas a shift in the financing burden that bene-fited the local authorities. At the same timethese projects also make it possible to targetsocial assistance more effectively, especially ifthey succeed in offering the long-term un-employed an opportunity to re-integratethemselves into the regular labour market ata later point in time and reduce the numberof persons able to work who receive social as-sistance.
Another important factor was the cut in
investment expenditure, which was, in fact,larger than a mere totalling of the items out-sourced might have suggested. The local au-thorities felt compelled to cut spending on in-vestment anyway over the short term owingto the particular content of the applicablebudget law. Rigidities, which were imposedon current expenditure not least by the re-quirements of higher government budgetlevels, made it impossible for the local author-ities to economise there to the same degree.Receipts, expenditure and indebted-

48Since the local authorities account for ap-
proximately three-fifths of all capital forma-tion recorded in government budgets, theirinvestment behaviour has had a significanteffect on the construction sector, which hadpreviously enlarged its capacity owing topent-up demand in the new Länder.
While it is true that the public infrastructure
of the western Länder is well-developed, thesustained decline in expenditure on capitalformation may still lead to bottlenecks insome areas. Local authority expenditure oncapital formation fell – partly due to outsour-cing, as already pointed out – by one-quarterto just under DM 49 billion last year, com-pared with its 1992 level, which was thehighest yet, owing not least to the exigenciesof German unification. The surpluses of thepast two years made a slight increase in cap-ital formation expenditure possible again inthe western Länder. However, initially, the pri-mary beneficiaries of this rise were acquisitionof land and investment in machinery andequipment. In the eastern Länder where theconstruction sector continues to play a signifi-cantly larger role than in the west and thusexerts a greater influence on the macroeco-nomic trend, capital formation expenditurecontinued to decline in 1999.
The consolidation efforts of the local author-
ities were directed not only towards a reduc-tion in investments but also towards a reduc-tion in staffing levels. Between 1995 and1998 the number of employed personscovered by the core budgets fell by 11% to1.16 million. The municipalities in the easternLänder accounted for a larger portion of thedecline. Staffing levels, however, still remain
above the west German average. This not-withstanding, the trend in personnel expend-iture was strongly influenced by outsourcingas well.
The local authorities were also interested in
improving their financial balances not only byselling off more land but especially throughthe sale of participating interests. In 1998,proceeds from the sale of participating inter-ests reached a record level of DM 3
12billion.
Last year receipts from the same sourcedropped to DM 2
14billion. Generally speak-
ing, there is still considerable revenue to beearned from selling participating interests,not least through the sale of local authorityholdings in public utility companies. Taking awell-designed market economy as a criterion,it seems appropriate for the local authoritiesto divest themselves of corporate holdings, allthe more so as the problems arising from nat-ural monopolies have become less acute inmany sectors.
By contrast, the fact that the local authorities
were forced by the Federal Parliament in1992 to guarantee the right of every childfrom three to six years of age to attend kin-dergarten from 1996 on has placed a strainon local authority finance. This regulation hadthe initial effect of confronting the local au-thorities with the need for additional invest-ment in kindergarten facilities; according tothe accounting results of the local authorities’budgets, the size of this extra investment ex-penditure lies, by some estimates, betweenDM
12billion and DM 1 billion annually. It

49al investment grants from the other levels of
government. An increase in the supply of kin-dergarten capacities implies at the same time,however, a considerable rise in related ex-penditure, i.e. in personnel and other operat-ing expenditure, and in transfers to theowners of these institutions. A comparison ofthe accounting results of 1992 and 1997 sug-gests, after adjustment for a rise in receiptsfrom fees and transfers, that this places anadditional burden on the budget amountingto approximately DM 3 billion per year.
The fact that Länder transfers, which account
for approximately one-third of local author-ities’ total receipts, were DM 5 billion lessthan in 1995 also made itself felt. The de-crease is partly attributable to the smaller sizeof payments within the general tax-sharingsystem. In addition, Länder transfers for localauthority investment expenditure have be-come fewer; this both contributed to thelatter’s decline and was partly the result ofthis development. Finally, the decreasingnumber of fugitives and persons seekingpolitical asylum, which provided the localauthorities with some relief, also led to adecline in the reimbursements awarded byLänder for the corresponding services.
The trend in tax receipts was subject to op-
posing influences. Up to 1997 revenue fromthis source had remained at virtually the samelevel, thus placing a strain on local authorityfinances. A significant reason for the unchan-ging level of municipal tax revenue was theconsiderable decrease in receipts from as-sessed income tax, which was not least attrib-utable to the generous special depreciationfacilities for investments in the eastern Län-
der. In addition, tax revenue at all levels ofgovernment was affected by a significant en-largement of the basic tax allowance from1996 on, which had been mandated by a rul-ing of the Federal Constitutional Court. Thenew regulation governing the family allow-ance system, which entered into force in1996, likewise had a negative effect on localauthorities’ shares in income tax revenue.Since then child benefits – which have in themeantime been raised several times – arebooked to the detriment of wage tax rev-enue.

50and local authorities suffer as a result, the
Länder have been granted an additional sharein turnover tax revenue, starting at 5
12per-
centage points.
In the last two years tax receipts have again
increased substantially, thereby improving thebudgetary situation. Thus, with receipts fromassessed income tax on the rebound, localauthorities’ share in income tax revenue againrose considerably. At the same time the localauthorities had been enjoying receipts fromincreasing turnover tax revenue since 1998;they had been given a share in turnover taxrevenue amounting to 2.2%
4(1998: DM 434
billion) as recompense for the loss in revenueresulting from the repeal of the trade tax onbusiness capital in the western Länder. Des-pite the abolition of this part of trade tax,which had been criticised for being a tax onreal assets, receipts from trade tax altogethercontinued to grow at a surprisingly rapid ratein the last two years owing to extensive back-payments and larger advance payments,while collection multipliers remained mostlyunchanged. The local authorities, however,had to transfer a larger share of these receiptsthan before to the Länder in the form of con-tribution levies.
Differences in the economic strength and col-
lection multipliers of the various municipal-ities led to substantial differences in receiptsfrom trade tax, which represents the most im-portant revenue source, at least for the majorcities. Taking the cities of North Rhine-West-phalia as an example, gross per capita tradetax revenue in Düsseldorf was DM 1,900 in1998, while comparable revenue in Duisburgamounted to less than a quarter of this fig-
ure, although the collection multiplier wasonly marginally lower. Average gross percapita trade tax revenue for North Rhine-Westphalia was equivalent to approximatelyDM 720.
Effects of outsourcing municipal
amenities
The question may legitimately be raised, in
keeping with free market principles, whetherservices to be offered by the public sector,and thus by the local authorities, cannot beprovided more efficiently by private enter-prises. If it proves inappropriate to engage aservice provider from the private sector, thenext step would be to choose an organisa-tional form which would at least allow thestate to perform the service efficiently. In thelast few years, progress has been made, espe-cially at the local authority level, both in limit-ing government involvement and in reorgan-ising the form in which municipal amenitiesare offered.
When deciding exactly how municipal duties
are to be discharged, the local authorities are,in principle, free to choose among a varietyof organisational forms besides the classicaladministrative one. Earlier the in-house ser-vices (Regiebetrieb) model had predomin-
ated; it is included in the local authoritybudget, together with all its receipts and ex-

51penditure, and is thus subject to governmen-
tal accounting rules. The concept of in-houseservices gave rise, however, to certain prob-lems, especially with regard to the provisionof public utility and waste disposal services.At all events, the latter items, which mustcover their costs entirely through receiptsfrom fees and charges, make it necessary toresort to elements of commercial accountingprinciples. Moreover, civil service legislationstatutes, including those governing publicsector salaries, sharply circumscribe the abilityof institutions to adjust to changing needs.
In the case of financially autonomous, public-
ly owned enterprises (Eigenbetriebe), as op-
posed to in-house service providers, the onlyitem that must be shown in the local author-ity core budget is the grant amount neededor the profit transferred. Nevertheless theseinstitutions remain legally dependent entitiesand thus fall entirely within the compass ofexisting civil service legislation and wagesettlements. By contrast, autonomous, pub-licly owned companies (Eigengesellschaften),
such as the municipal private limited com-panies or municipal public limited companies,are independent entities from a legal stand-point. As such, they are free to diverge fromthe specific provisions of civil service law, astatus which gives them greater economicflexibility.
The local authorities have been engaged for
some time now in outsourcing municipalamenities; this process has had a substantialeffect on local authority accounting and onthe corresponding statistics. Receipts fromfees and charges are particularly affected.Since the mid-nineties, these receipts have
fallen by more than 10% after having sus-tained annual rises of over 5%. The majorfactor in this development has probably beenthe conversion of in-house service providersinto financially autonomous, publicly ownedenterprises which remain legally dependentbut which show their turnover in a separateprofit and loss account rather than showingfees and charges in the core budgets. By con-trast, when in-house service providers areconverted into legally independent, autono-mous, publicly owned companies, fees andcharges usually continue to be entered intothe core budgets as received and are thenpassed on.
Irrespective of the chosen form of organisa-
tion, outsourcing has led to a continuous de-cline in the personnel expenditure posted inthe core budgets. How much of the reductionof staff levels of the last few years may betraced back to such outsourcing measures re-mains, however, an open question. Total per-sonnel expenditure between 1995 and 1998would probably show a rise rather than theposted decline, if the outsourced undertak-ings had been included in the core budgets.The effects of such outsourcing on other op-erating expenditure are ambiguous. If – as isoften the case with autonomous companies –fees and charges continue to be booked onthe receipts side of the core budget, the cor-responding purchases of outsourced servicesby the local authorities must be shown on theexpenditure side; the latter items are oftensignificantly larger than the other operatingexpenditure which has been outsourced sincethey must also include the funding for per-

52The effects of outsourcing municipal amenities on city finances, as exemplified
by the city of Frankfurt am Main
In 1999 the city of Frankfurt adopted several
major reorganising measures:
– The most significant transformation involved
the municipal drainage system, which wasoutsourced as a financially autonomous, pub-licly owned enterprise. In the annual accountsfor 1998, this institution was still listed as hav-ing earned revenue in fees and chargesamounting to approximately DM 220 million.Since it was outsourced, the charges have nolonger been routed through the municipalbudget but have been booked directly withthe municipality-owned enterprise as turn-over. Similarly, personnel expenditure, whichamounted to slightly over DM 30 million, ad-ministrative and operating expenses (slightlyover DM 80 million) – the most important com-ponent of “other operating expenditure” –and imputed costs relating to depreciationand interest (almost DM 90 million) no longerappear in the budget. The quarterly cash stat-istics for 1999 set the value of such municipalinvestments at virtually zero, as opposed toapproximately DM 70 million in 1998.
– Since 1999, Frankfurt’s evening school for
adults (Volkshochschule) has likewise been
run as a financially autonomous, publiclyowned enterprise. As a result, receipts fromfees and charges (more than DM 5 million),personnel expenditure (slightly over DM 15million) and administrative and operating ex-penses (slightly under DM 10 million) have alldisappeared from the budget. To compensatefor the losses generated by the adult eveningschool, however, the budget plan has setaside approximately DM 15 million for a newsubsidy item.
– The municipal assistance programme for chil-
dren, adolescents and families was out-sourced as well. Business documents relatingto the new, financially autonomous but pub-licly owned enterprise, which were submittedalong with the budget plan, indicate that re-ceipts from fees and charges amounting to al-most DM 15 million, personnel expenditureof just under DM 40 million and administra-tive and operating expenses amounting toaround DM 20 million will be missing fromthe core budget. Additional room, however,has been reserved in the new budget for cur-rent grants amounting to slightly over DM 45million.
– The city of Frankfurt turned over responsibil-
ity for collecting the fees charged by thewaste disposal plants to the disposal companyFES GmbH. As a result, revenue in the form offees and charges has decreased by approxi-mately DM 50 million on the receipts side ofthe budget whereas the expenditure sidehas been short the same amount in adminis-
trative and operating expenses. The budgetwill continue to show the fees charged forwaste collection.
Altogether, the outsourcing measures described
above amount to a loss of almost DM 300 mil-lion in receipts from fees and charges. If thisamount were included in the cash statistics for1999, revenue in the form of fees and chargeswould not have declined by one-third but wouldactually have risen by around 5%. Similarly, thedecline in the city’s personnel expenditure from1998 to 1999, which was equivalent to DM 100million or just under 10%, can largely be attrib-uted to the aforementioned outsourcing activ-ities. The decline in the number of staffed postsin the core budget by slightly more than 1,000or almost 10% between 1997 and 1999, as at-tested by the budget plans, may be explained al-most exclusively in terms of these outsourcingmeasures. These institutional outsourcing oper-ations also account for a decrease in administra-tive and operating expenses of slightly morethan DM 160 million. Since the cash statisticsshow only a decline of approximately DM 115million, it is clear that the figures for these ex-penditure items, if adjusted accordingly, willpoint to a substantial rise in 1999. The conver-sion of the municipal drainage system into a fi-nancially autonomous, publicly owned enter-prise, in particular, eased the financial burdenwhich the servicing of the public debt hadplaced on the core budget. The transfer of assetsmeant that liabilities – equivalent to aroundDM 850 million – were also removed from thecore budget, which was thereby relieved ofinterest payments amounting to around DM 50million. This largely explains the fact that, ac-cording to the cash statistics, the interest paidby the city fell by almost DM 90 million. The out-sourcing of the municipal drainage system alsohad a considerable impact on developments inconstruction investment. Adjusted for the ef-fects of this measure, the decline in constructioninvestment, which the cash statistics record asbeing almost 15%, becomes an increase ofaround 10%.
Even if the measures adopted by the city of
Frankfurt in 1999 cannot be generalised, theydemonstrate in an exemplary fashion how pro-cesses of outsourcing, which, from an economicstandpoint, are to be welcomed in many cases,result in significant distortions at the statisticallevel, which must be taken into account whenassessing and controlling municipal activities.Revenue and expenditure items are particularlyvulnerable to such distortions. The financial bal-ance is not as strongly affected since in mostcases, outsourcing usually involves matching en-tries, which then disappear from both sides ofthe budget.

53sonnel expenditure and the imputed costs in-
volved in running the autonomous com-panies.
5If, however – as is usually the case
with financially autonomous, publicly run en-terprises – the local authority budget nowshows only a clearing item corresponding tonet income, the statistically recorded figurefor other operating expenditure will also besmaller.
By contrast, outsourcing has exercised a defin-
ite dampening effect on the trend in the ex-penditure on capital formation. The waterdrainage sector has shown an especially pro-nounced decline in capital formation expend-iture in the last few years, during which a ser-ies of organisational measures were imple-mented. Still, these changes only partly explainthe marked decrease in local authority capitalformation.
6The decline in capital formation
brought about by the outsourcing of certainservices, however, failed to result in a com-mensurate narrowing of budget deficits. Inkeeping with the cost recovery principle, de-preciation allowances and imputed interestmust also be financed solely on the basis ofproceeds from fees and charges. Since thesecosts do not represent real outflows in rev-enue, the local authority budgets built upequivalent surpluses, which were credited tothe outsourced units as part of the reorganisa-tion process.
Outsourcing not only has the effect of redu-
cing net borrowing; the accumulated debtwhich the institution being reorganised hasincurred in financing its investments is oftenreassigned as well. While net borrowing bythe local authorities amounted to approxi-mately DM 22 billion between 1996 and
1999, their level of indebtedness rose by onlyDM 4 billion to DM 176 billion between theend of 1995 and the end of 1999. The reasonfor this discrepancy is to be found in the largeentry for “other debt withdrawn” in the debtlevel statistics, which would appear to becomprised mainly of outsourcing.
Generally speaking, outsourcing has made
the evaluation of local authority finances con-siderably more difficult. In order to ensure anunbiased analysis – which would allow for acomparison with other levels of governmentas well – the responsible statistical agencywould also have to collect data on the re-ceipts and expenditure of (at least financially)autonomous but still municipally controlledinstitutions which could then be included inthe budget data for the local authorities. Atpresent, a rough idea of the extent to whichlocal authority finance statistics have beendistorted by outsourcing can be obtainedonly by consulting estimates and case studies.Thus, in order to show the extent of the dis-tortions to which outsourcing may give rise,an overview of the problem, which takes the1999 comparative figures for the city ofFrankfurt am Main as an example, has beenpresented on page 52.
5Thus, a large portion of the rise experienced by the
local authorities in North Rhine-Westphalia in other oper-
ating expenditure – over 10% last year – can probably be
explained in this way.

54The state of local authority finance in the
eastern Länder
All in all, considerable differences still exist
between the local authorities in the westernand eastern Länder. It is true that in 1995 the“Solidarity Pact” significantly stepped up theamount of funding received by east Germanlocal authorities by including the eastern Län-der in the general Länder revenue equalisa-tion scheme and granting special requirementtransfers and financial aid for investment ex-penditure from the Federal Government from1995 on. This had the effect of reducing thedeficit of the east German local authorities byDM 3 billion to DM 2 billion in 1995, whichaccounted for approximately one-seventh ofthe total local authority deficit in that year. Inthe following years, however, the east Ger-man local authorities were far from being
able to keep pace with improvements in thefinancial positions of the western Länder.
The main reason for this has been the negative
trend in receipts. Since 1995, receipts havebeen declining continuously by a total of ap-proximately 13% and in 1999 receipts wereper capita almost 4% lower than the corres-ponding western figure; in 1995 they had stillbeen hovering at 10% above the westernlevel owing to the substantial size of the trans-fers involved (see the chart on page 55). Thepersistently low level of tax revenue in easternGermany has exacerbated the strain on re-ceipts. Whereas in 1999 the local authorities inthe old Länder received almost DM 1,500 intaxes per inhabitant, the same figure for theeastern Länder came to a mere DM 600 atWest

55best, or 40% of the west German level. Since
1995, the gap has widened by an additional1
12percentage points. Receipts from income
and trade taxes are largely responsible for thecomparatively meagre tax revenue; per capitataxes on land and buildings and local authorityshares in turnover tax revenue bring in morethan two-thirds of western levels.
Disregarding high unit labour costs, which
have narrowed profits, it is the special con-cessions granted in connection with financialassistance to the east which have especiallycut into revenue from trade tax and assessedincome tax. The fact that the income level inthe eastern Länder is lower also places a ceil-ing on the receipts that may be expectedfrom local authority shares in income tax rev-enue. Similarly, child benefits have had a par-ticularly negative impact on wage tax revenuefrom 1996 on since, relatively speaking, thisdeduction, which is unrelated to incomelevel, affects east German revenue to a muchgreater degree. In 1999 total per capita re-ceipts from income and trade taxes in theeastern local authorities amounted to slightlymore than 30% of the west German level.
Given that the tax receipts of the local au-
thorities in the east are so low, their budgetsare especially dependent on transfers fromthe Länder but also from the Federal Govern-ment. Thus total per capita receipts from theother levels of government were almost twiceas high as those in the western Länder in1999. This gap is, however, narrowing sincethe east German Länder have been substan-tially reducing their transfers from 1995 on inan effort to consolidate their budgets.The local authorities have had to respond to
this negative trend in receipts with reductionsin expenditure, which are still far more exten-sive than comparable efforts in the west.While in 1995 local authority expenditure perinhabitant in eastern local authorities was stillhigher than the corresponding western levelby one-tenth, it had fallen somewhat belowthat level by 1999 (see the chart on page 56).
7
This reflects the fact that wage settlements,which had raised the salaries of public sectoremployees from 80% of the western level (asof October 1994) to 86.5% in 1999, hadforced the local authorities there to come togrips with even larger financial burdens than%

56in the west. Thus, in an effort to curb person-
nel expenditure, the number of employeescovered in the core budget was significantlyreduced, an unavoidable measure consideringthe high levels of staffing. These economisingmeasures notwithstanding, personnel ex-penditure per inhabitant in the east remainedat 110% of the western level (compared – itis true – with 127% in 1995), although ex-penditure on old-age pensions and healthcare for civil servants has so far continued tobe relatively low. Staffing levels correspond-ing to core budget items still exceeded percapita the western reference value by 40%(it was two-thirds in 1995). If only fully em-ployed persons are counted, the ratio be-comes 25% (compared with 60% in 1995).This figure suggests the need for furthershedding of personnel in order to avoid over-
taxing local authority budgets in the east.
Whereas the local authorities’ level of indebt-
edness in the west – buoyed by a substantialimprovement in their financial positions andby the outsourcing of public services – re-mained largely unchanged compared with1995, the level of indebtedness in the eastcontinued to rise owing to a persistentwidening of local authority deficits. As a re-sult, the local authorities in the east havenow reached a level of indebtedness per in-habitant approaching that of the west.
8The
interest paid per inhabitant is already equal toslightly more than 90% of the western level(compared with two-thirds in 1995).
By contrast, the local authorities in the east-
ern Länder have so far only had to spend percapita on social benefits approximately two-thirds of what the west spends. The main rea-son for this is probably that the lower costs ofinstitutional care and the more extensive useof previous levels of the social security systemhelp ease the financial strains placed on thelocal authority budget by social assistance.The latter plays a particularly important rolein the case of social assistance awarded onthe basis of unemployment. Moreover, theclaims on pension benefits by women arehigher than in west Germany owing to theirgreater participation in the labour force atthe time of the German Democratic Republic.%

57Even disregarding the fact that the decline in
expenditure on capital formation was muchlarger in east Germany, it still remains truethat significantly more funds are spent per in-habitant for this purpose than in the west. Inthe mid-nineties per capita capital formationin the east still outstripped the western levelof expenditure by three-quarters; by 1999 theeast’s lead had been narrowed to just under50%. Although many problems affecting theinfrastructure in the east have in the mean-time been addressed, considerable shortcom-ings still remain in some areas that will haveto be tended to in the coming years.Current trends and problems
The trend in local authority finance this year
will be characterised by at best marginalgrowth in total receipts and a somewhatmore pronounced increase in expenditure.Capital formation expenditure for Germanyas a whole is expected to rise further, al-though the local authorities in the east will besubject to continued pressure to consolidateand a renewed decline in capital formationexpenditure is expected there. All things con-sidered, the local authorities might still beable to achieve a financial surplus in 2000, aswas the case in 1999. The budgetary situ-ation next year, by contrast, will be domin-ated by the planned tax reductions, whichmake it seem more likely that the trend for2001 will be towards deficits. Apart fromWest

58losses in the local authorities’ share of income
tax revenue, there may be sizeable cuts intransfers from the Länder under the generaltax-sharing system, with the result that localauthorities with weaker tax revenue will beparticularly hard hit.
The liberalisation of the public utility markets
in the European Union might have a powerfuleffect on local authority finance. Disregardingthe not yet foreseeable trend in licensing fees– up to now, the local authorities have re-ceived such licensing fees from utilities in ex-change for road use and guaranteed monop-oly status – the downward pressure beingexerted on the profit margins of public utilityenterprises, in particular, will probably in-crease. The loss in profits would also make itmore difficult to continue the traditionalcross-subsidising of municipal transport ser-vices, which have been running deficits. Des-pite all the problems which the liberalisationof utility markets poses for the local author-ities, there is no reason to abandon deregula-tion, which is beneficial at a macroeconomiclevel.
On the contrary, the local authorities them-
selves derive efficiency benefits not only fromthe outsourcing of activities that had oncebelonged to the core budgets but also fromthe ongoing privatisation of marketable ser-vices. In the last few years, considerable pro-gress has, in fact, been made in the privatisa-tion of public services, a process which merits
continuation. As for those services which areno longer recorded in the core budgets butwhich continue to be controlled by the localauthorities, it is important that they be in-cluded in the local authority statistics; thisensures that public sector operations can bemonitored in their entirety.
Even after all the foreseeable financial bur-
dens of the years to come have been takeninto account, it may reasonably be assertedthat, among the different levels of govern-ment, the local authorities, taken together,will come nearest to attaining budget pos-itions close to balance or in surplus, an ob-jective specified in the European Stability andGrowth Pact. The local authorities, as an ag-gregate, owe their sound financial positionnot least to the provisions of the applicablelocal authority budget law, which compelledthem to adopt austerity measures – in largepart to the detriment of capital formation,however – after the extraordinarily large def-icits incurred up to the mid-nineties. Thecoming years will confront the local author-ities not only with the fiscal policy task ofaverting another slide into deficit but alsowith that of maintaining an effective infra-structure consistent with the policy of “quali-tative consolidation”. This presupposes con-tinuing vigilance in holding down currentexpenditure, even in times of acceleratingreceipts.

59RTGSplus–
the Bundesbank’snew system forindividual paymentsWith the introduction of the euro on
January 1, 1999, the European pay-ment scene underwent substantialchange, which has necessitated a re-orientation of the range of large-valuepayment services offered by the Bun-desbank. In the single currency area,newly established European large-value payment systems have been putinto operation and now share the(largely unchanged) volume of nation-al and cross-border payments withexisting European large-value paymentsystems. In cooperation with the Ger-man banking industry, the Bundesbankhas designed a new liquidity-savinglarge-value payment system in eurocalled RTGS
plus, which unites the exist-
ing German large-value payment sys-tems Euro Link System (ELS) – includingthe TARGET interface via the nationalinterlinking component (NIC) – andEuro Access Frankfurt (EAF) to form asingle payment system in euro.RTGS
plusis designed to set new stand-
ards in terms of services and availabil-ity. Having been approved by the Cen-tral Bank Council at its meeting onJanuary 27, 2000, the project is now inthe process of implementation. Thefollowing article will describe the mainconsiderations that led to this decisionand provide some insight into the de-sign of RTGS

60Profound change in European large-
value payments since the start of StageThree of EMU
With the introduction of the euro on Janu-
ary 1, 1999, the European payment sceneunderwent substantial change. In the singlecurrency area, the newly established Euro-pean large-value payment systems TARGETand Euro1 have commenced operations andnow share the (largely unchanged) volumeof national and cross-border payments withexisting European large-value payment sys-tems. As a consequence of the introductionof the single currency in the euro area, theformer national link between the currency ofthe payment instructions and the settlementsystem or the place of settlement has disap-peared. This has extended the geographicalreach of payment instructions in euro, since,generally speaking, any euro payment systemmay be used to settle these payments – pro-vided that the beneficiary can be reached viathat system.
The co-existence of various systems in the
euro area (and in other EU countries such asthe United Kingdom, provided that the sys-tems are euro-compliant) opens up new pos-sibilities for system operators, the banking in-dustry and, last but not least, customers. Yetthey also mean that all parties involved needto rethink their established payment settle-ment processes and practices and reorientthem in strategic terms:
– System operators need to adjust their cus-
tomer orientation. They are particularlyfaced with the question of what banksand geographical regions they should ad-
dress their services to.
– Credit institutions need to decide on the
systems and payment channels they wantto use. The main parameters underlyingthis decision are the incurred costs (includ-ing the associated liquidity requirements),the required velocity and security of pay-ment settlement and the system-specificextra benefits (e.g. an efficient linkage tosecurities settlement systems).
– The banks’ customers (including the cor-
respondent banks in third countries) canstreamline their bank relationships be-cause they need fewer bank relationshipsin the euro area to settle euro transactionsthan in the past.
It was to be expected that market partici-
pants would make intensive use of the newopportunities, thus breaking up the paymentstructures that had manifested themselvesover the past few decades. In fact, the newconditions very quickly resulted in radicalchanges in the European payment infrastruc-ture.
Situation in European large-value
payments
The TARGET network of the European System
of Central Banks (ESCB) and the Euro BankingAssociation’s (EBA) Euro1 are two paymentsystems which have rapidly established theirpresence as new players in the market.

61The TARGET system consists of the national
real-time gross settlement systems of the 15EU member states and the ECB’s paymentmechanism. All systems are interlinked, enab-ling urgent cross-border euro payments, e.g.money market transactions, to be settledsafely between the EU member states in amatter of minutes. TARGET
1is used primarily
for interbank payments, for example in thecontext of banks’ money market or foreignexchange transactions, but it can also beused by banks as a conduit for customer pay-ments.
2The settlement of interbank transac-
tions is also the reason why TARGET becamethe most extensively used system (in terms oftransaction value) for large-value payments ineuro immediately after it was launched. Oneof the principal users of the system is the Ger-man banking industry, which accounts formore than one-third of all payment instruc-tions submitted to TARGET. In addition, justover one-third of all TARGET payments are re-ceived by participants residing in Germany.
In terms of volume, by contrast, the EBA’s
Euro1 system is number one among Euro-pean large-value payment systems. The largemarket share is due to the fact that Euro1 isused to a considerable extent for commercialcustomer payments. Unlike the real-timegross settlement systems run by the EU cen-tral banks, Euro1 is, by design, a (protected)net settlement system. Although Euro1 pay-ments are final even before the end of theday, the clearing of the balances that origin-ated during the day, and thus the transfer ofcentral bank money between banks – viaTARGET – is not carried out until the end ofthe operating day. The risk-reducing mechan-isms (such as credit limits for the individual
members, stand-by liquidity pools and loss-sharing agreements) are designed to copewith potential defaults of participants at theend of the day.
The chart on page 62 provides an overview of
the significance of the various euro-area pay-ment systems on the basis of the working dayaverages of the number of payments.

62run by the Bundesbank; EAF is the Bundes-
bank’s liquidity-saving hybrid system whichcombines elements of both gross and netsettlement systems and in which paymentsare covered by offsetting payment flows orby prefunded central bank money.
However, the chart only provides a snapshot
of the current market situation and does notfully illustrate the dynamics seen over the lastfew months. The evolution of selected large-value payment systems over time since Janu-ary 1999 provides more details about thestructural developments that occurred.
At the beginning of last year the launch of
Euro1 and TARGET and the loss of the“home-field advantage” due to the introduc-tion of the euro, especially concerning thesettlement of D-Mark/US dollar foreign-
exchange transactions, resulted in a sharp de-cline in the use of Euro Access Frankfurt(EAF). As the year 1999 progressed, all sys-tems discussed here showed a positive trend,with the distribution remaining fairly stable.This probably owes much to the fact that thesettlement of cross-border euro payments bymeans of bilateral correspondent banking re-lationships has been reduced and that thesepayment instructions are processed by morecost-effective and efficient central paymentinfrastructures instead.
Irrespective of this growth, competition is ex-
pected to increase distinctly once CLS Bankenters the market. CLS Bank will simultan-eously settle the currency leg of foreign-ex-change transactions for selected currenciesworldwide, adhering to the principle of “pay-ment against payment”. According to currentplans, CLS Bank is due to begin operations inthe second half of 2001.
Impact on the Bundesbank’s large-value
payment services
The dynamic structural change and the devel-
opments described above have also prompt-ed the Bundesbank to intensify its efforts tocomprehensively reorient its range of large-value payment services. In this context, devel-opments in EAF, the key competitive segmentthat includes an important international com-ponent, are of major importance. Although ithad been expected that the volume andvalue processed via EAF would decline, theextent of that decline (to half of the volumes1st quarter of 2000

63and values processed in 1998) was rather sur-
prising. There are various reasons for thesedevelopments.
– First of all, there is the loss of the “home-
field advantage” of the D-Mark. Transac-tions that formerly had to be processedvia a German settlement system becauseof the currency can now be settled viaother euro systems in other EU countriesas well.
– Moreover, small and medium-sized euro-
area correspondent banks have becomeindependent in the settlement of theirpayments. They increasingly process theirtransactions directly using TARGET with-out involving any correspondent bank. Ac-cordingly, a number of large Germanclearing banks have suffered noticeablereductions in their correspondent bankingbusiness.
– In addition, changes in the preferences
among foreign banks have played a keyrole. Whereas foreign banks mainly usedEAF to settle the DM transactions of theentire institution via their branches regis-tered in Germany, the parent institutionsnow make use of alternative paymentchannels for the entire institution. A smallbut significant number of foreign EAFbanks prefer the EBA’s Euro1 system andhave thus largely stopped using EAF.
In spite of these developments, EAF has still
remained one of the main players among theEuropean clearing systems, even in the differ-ent euro environment. This owes somethingto the fact that the EAF’s liquidity-saving ap-
proach, based mainly on the use of offsettingpayment flows, has still proven to be attract-ive and functional, despite the decline in use.
It is not as if the EAF banks had not made a
number of attempts to agree on the use ofthe payment systems before the start ofStage Three of EMU. This was designed toavoid unnecessary friction caused by an unco-ordinated use of different payment systems.Unfortunately, they could not reach an agree-ment in all cases. The high-volume clearingbanks still have different preferences for vari-ous reasons. In this context, the interests ofvarious financial centres play a certain role,too.

64banks’ liquidity-management and money
market operations, is also a competitive fac-tor.
The change in the underlying conditions, the
decline in the number of payments processedvia EAF and the increasingly European per-spective assumed by major credit institutions,in particular, have ultimately motivated theBundesbank to realign its strategy concerninglarge-value payment services rapidly and in afar-sighted manner. Had the Bundesbank as-sumed a wait-and-see attitude, this wouldhave led to a vicious circle of increasing unitcosts and higher prices, on the one hand, andfurther losses in the volume of payments, onthe other. This development would be accel-erated by adhering to national “standards”(e.g. with regard to data formats or commu-nication standards), which in a European per-
spective has increasingly proved to be a bar-rier to efficiency.
The rather favourable developments in ELS
have not rendered the aforementioned needfor action obsolete, either. Up until now, ELShas largely been geared to national require-ments and has only insufficiently beentailored to the needs of internationally orient-ed credit institutions. It thus cannot make upfor the decline in EAF and the resultant costdeficit. In addition, the competitive momen-tum which is mainly affecting EAF today willsooner or later have an impact on ELS, too.One indication of this is the fact that thelarge credit institutions account for the lion’sshare of the business in ELS, too. As integra-tion proceeds in the euro area, the incipientstructural change will ultimately bring abreath of fresh air into the otherwise slow-moving national scene.
Moreover, the German TARGET component,
which consists of a large number of local sub-systems (such as ELS or the interlinking com-ponent) has a very complex structure. Inorder to meet the high expectations of mar-ket participants and to further enhance avail-ability and throughput, fundamental changesin the technical design of the German TAR-GETcomponent are indispensable.

65GET, Euro1 and EAF – have remained relative-
ly stable since the start of Stage Three ofEMU, this cannot conceal the fact that in thelong run European banks will not use severalpayment systems in euro which, in part, pro-vide identical services. In addition, the seg-mentation of the total volume of payments invarious systems makes it much more difficultto operate the payment systems in a cost-covering manner at competitive prices. More-over, the available liquidity in euro must besplit up into too many portions, which mightimpede the flow of funds in the various sys-tems. Thus, business is likely to be concen-trated in the best-performing and most eco-nomical systems. In addition, Europe-widecompetition is already in full swing and hasresulted in an improved functionality of pay-ment products.
In this situation, the Bundesbank, as in the
past, was able to rely on the active supportand cooperation of its customers. At the verystart of 1999, the then-EAF member forum,which consisted of eleven domestic and for-eign banks with a large volume of payments,analysed the latest developments in euro pay-ments and assessed the impacts that were tobe expected over the medium term. The EAFmember forum unanimously agreed to rec-ommend that the Bundesbank develop aliquidity-saving RTGS system, thereby main-taining the specific advantages of EAF andELS while concentrating them in an improvedform in one system. In particular, the Bundes-bank, as a payment services provider, wasasked to comply with the following require-ments:– To offset the disadvantages resulting from
the existing segmentation in ELS (littleliquidity-saving effects, limited tools forliquidity management) and EAF (limitednumber of users, shorter business hours,no TARGET access, no real-time grosssettlement option), particularly with re-gard to the required duplication of devel-opment work and expenditure for theBundesbank and their customers resultingfrom the operation and use of two inde-pendent systems.
– Consistent single-transaction-oriented pro-
cessing which facilitates the efficient in-ternal treatment at the receiving credit in-stitution.
– Usage of European standards, particularly
“plain” S.W.I.F.T. data formats. Thesehave already been implemented in manyother European payment systems.
– Provision of interactive information and
control options for uses.
The alternative, i.e. to maintain the status
quo of ELS and EAF for the time being, wasrejected in view of the described scenario inEuropean large-value payments. Moreover,the idea of moving EAF into position in themarket as a pan-European clearing system,possibly in private ownership, was rejecteddue to the conflict of interests this solutionwould entail for the banks. In the Bundes-bank’s view, other reasons not to pursue thisapproach were that a) the opportunity of asensible consolidation would have been

become a competitor of TARGET.
The main features of RTGSplus
The recommendations of, and requirements
demanded by, the German banking industryultimately resulted in the conception of anew RTGS system, “RTGS
plus”. In this pro-
cess, representatives from all banking groupswere involved right from the start. The charton page 67 provides an overview of the sys-tem’s most important features:
4
The system is open to all credit institutionsand securities firms registered in the Euro-pean Economic Area (EEA). There are variousflexible options for the daily provision andwithdrawal of the liquidity required for set-tling payments which is held on specificRTGS
plusaccounts. This “liquidity bridge” also
includes transfers via TARGET.
The incorporation of liquidity-saving elements
in the gross settlement procedure of an RTGSsystem enables customers to organise theirpayment processing individually according totheir preferences concerning throughput andliquidity savings. Up until now, liquidity-sav-ing algorithms in RTGS systems – if any –have only been of minor importance.
Each RTGS
plusparticipant can specifically
manage the use of the liquidity he suppliesaccording to his needs.
RTGS
plusprovides extensive real-time infor-
mation and makes it possible to modify allcontrol parameters interactively by using
modern browsing technology.
RTGSplususes internationally established
S.W.I.F.T. standards for data formats andS.W.I.F.T. services in communication technol-ogy. SWIFTNet InterAct, a new, trend-settingservice based on the latest Internet technol-ogy, is used for online information and inter-active control.
The advantages of RTGS
plus
Since RTGSplusis an integrated system, it
allows its participants to make use of exten-sive synergies. The consolidation of the pay-ment volumes previously split up into EAFand ELS and the single RTGS
plusliquidity pool
alone make it possible to further improvepayment throughput and liquidity usage. Ini-tial simulations have confirmed this effect. Inaddition, customers will only have to operateone single S.W.I.F.T. interface to access theBundesbank’s single payment system; inmany cases this interface is already in placeand used to process foreign transactions.
RTGS
plusoffers safe real-time gross settle-
ment for all payments submitted. All paymentinstructions are immediately checked againstthe available liquidity in a single-transaction-oriented manner and settled with immediatefinality if they are covered.
Payments for which no sufficient liquidity is
available are placed into a queue. The differ-

67ent intelligent mechanisms for the dissolution
of the queue allow the payments to be pro-cessed in a liquidity-saving way while thetime the payments remain in the system canbe minimised. Just as in EAF, these mechan-isms consist in the identification and simul-taneous booking of bilaterally or multilaterallyoffsetting payment flows. The liquidity-savingsettlement enables RTGS
pluscustomers to op-
timise their holdings of collateral, thereby re-ducing the corresponding opportunity costs.This will particularly be to the advantage ofcredit institutions – such as foreign banks –whose pool of collateral and minimum re-serve holdings are relatively small.
There are two different types of payments in
RTGS
plus, namely express and limit payments.
Generally, both types of payments are pro-cessed in the same way. In addition, they
both use the single RTGSplusliquidity pool.
They differ from each other only in that ex-press payments use the entire RTGS
plusliquid-
ity available to the participant, whereas limitpayments additionally take account of limitsset by the sending participant.
The limits implemented in RTGS
plusare not to
be confused with the debit caps used in netsystems. Debit caps are designed to reducethe default risk by limiting a participant’smaximum intra-day debit position. This is ne-cessary in net systems because final settle-ment is usually not carried out until the endof the day. RTGS
plus, by contrast, works on a
fully covered basis, which makes this kind oflimitation measure irrelevant.Important features of RTGSplus

68Therefore, the limits in RTGSplusare only used
for liquidity management purposes and areset by the senders themselves. The senderscan thus determine the maximum amount ofliquidity they are willing to use for limit pay-ments, either generally or for individual coun-terparties. This makes it possible to avoid anuncontrolled outflow of liquidity. In many oftoday’s systems this function is performedthrough decentralised management by theparticipant himself, i.e. the participant priori-tises the payments to be submitted accordingto certain payment-specific criteria, such aspurpose of use or amount. By contrast, thecentral implementation of such features iseasier, more transparent and more efficient.Since the payments are predominantly held incentral queues, mutual coverage dependen-cies can be taken into account more quicklyand extensively. Other systems also permitthe use of liquidity to be limited (thoughthese options are less user-friendly). For ex-ample, they allow liquidity to be retained onseparate accounts on a case-by-case basis orpayments to be frozen in the system depend-ing on their amount. In addition, it is possiblein many EU countries to actively adjust the li-quidity available for payment purposes byconcluding specific repo transactions.
Furthermore, the positive experience gained
with sender limits in EAF has shown that theypromote the early submission of payments.This is a risk-free procedure for all banks in-volved as it limits the potential unilateral out-flow of liquidity. Therefore, the limit systemultimately leads to a high degree of synchron-isation of payment flows between the partici-pants and thus minimises the need for liquid-ity by making extensive use of mutual pay-
ment flows. Furthermore, it ensures a veryearly finality of the payments submitted andpromotes a fair behaviour within the commu-nity of participants.
In addition, the option of adjusting the limits
at any given time allows unforeseen situ-ations to be handled quickly and undesirabledelays in payment processing to be overcomerapidly.
RTGS
plusparticipants are not compelled to set
limits. Small institutions, in particular, maywaive this option if they see no need for it inview of their business volume or if they donot consider dedicated liquidity managementto be necessary for cost-benefit reasons.
The innovative online information and control
features allow RTGS
plusparticipants to keep a
clear picture of their current and potential li-quidity positions – at all times and in a veryuser-friendly way – and to obtain a widerange of information on individual paymentsor categories of payments (e.g. by viewingqueues for incoming and outgoing pay-ments). The up-to-date information and theextensive control options by means of amouse click or a keystroke give the partici-pants the possibility of comprehensively as-sessing their liquidity status and of arrangingthe processing of their RTGS
pluspayments in
a farsighted and demand-oriented way. Thisis of particular importance for those credit in-stitutions participating in several large-valuepayments systems simultaneously. In this re-spect, the online information and manage-ment options supported by RTGS

in other systems.
TARGET and RTGSplus
In spite of the market success of TARGET, it is
an undisputed fact that, technically speaking,the current structure of TARGET is not an op-timal solution. The TARGET network consist-ing of 16 independent systems has two basicflaws. One is that the technical heterogeneitystemming from the individual national RTGSsystems (including the national interlinkingcomponents) impairs the stability of the over-all system. The very time-critical payment in-structions with a high average value call for ahigh level of availability. This requirement wasclearly emphasised by TARGET users in a re-cent survey.
5The other is that the decentral-
ised structure and the heterogeneous scopeof services offered by the various national ac-cess systems restrict the options for providinginformation and supporting the liquidity man-agement of internationally oriented banks.However, enhancements as substantial asthese require a technical consolidation – andultimately the technical centralisation of pay-ment processing. This could also contributeto a reduction in costs (of developing and op-erating a variety of RTGS systems) and act asa counterweight to a further increase in thesystem’s complexity, with EU enlargementbeing just a matter of time.
RTGS
pluswill serve as the German TARGET ac-
cess, a feature in which it will replace ELS.RTGS
plusis therefore not to be seen as a com-
petitor of the TARGET system; rather, it is anintegral part of it. RTGSplusenables the quality
of the German TARGET component to be dis-tinctly improved and makes access to theoverall European TARGET system far more at-tractive.
– RTGS
plusensures a high degree of avail-
ability through state-of-the-art IT design,efficient fault management and maximumbackup capabilities.
– The use of S.W.I.F.T. standards, which are
also used in TARGET, helps avoid fracturesand also ensures a further convergence ofnational and cross-border EU payments.
– RTGS
plusoptimises the processing of TAR-
GET payments and also enhances the easeof use for customers submitting TARGETpayments.
In the meantime, a debate has started in the
European System of Central Banks about thefurther development of TARGET. The modern-isation of the TARGET sub-componentRTGS
pluson the basis of explicit customer re-
quirements will strengthen TARGET as awhole and is intended to provide importantideas for the future enhancement of the over-all TARGET system. To that extent, RTGS
plusis
also supported by the ECB. The inclusion ofliquidity-saving elements and the extensive in-formation-providing options, for example,comply with the requirements of large Euro-pean banks with regard to an efficient andcompetitive payment system. This was alsomade clear at a recent meeting of the ECB,

70the national central banks and major market
participants, including the European bankingassociations. Other central banks likewise areconsidering enhancing their systems, such asCHAPS Euro, the UK RTGS system. By puttingits plans for RTGS
pluson the table right from
the start, the Bundesbank has furthered thedebate about the future design of RTGS sys-tems and TARGET. However, in view of thedifficult political decision-making process,practical results, i.e. a completely revised oreven newly designed TARGET system, are notto be expected until 2005 at the earliest.Owing to its modular design based on inter-national standards, RTGS
plusis flexible
enough to match well with the envisagedTARGET enhancement. In addition, RTGS
plus
could promote the desirable harmonisationthrough its attractive remote-access optionsfor foreign banks or, even better, strategic al-liances with other central banks or groups ofbanks outside Germany.
Implementation and migration
In order to ensure that the new payment sys-
tem will succeed in the market, it must beimplemented rapidly. The Bundesbank hasscheduled RTGS
plusto be put into operation
in mid-2001. The very ambitious schedule forthe launch of RTGS
plusrequires all available
resources to be focused on this project sothat work on the project, in parallel to thecustomers’ implementation activities, can becompleted on time.
In all stages, from design to operation, the
Bundesbank has been closely cooperatingwith the banking industry in a spirit of part-
nership. To this end, a multi-staged, tight pro-ject management has been set up to ensurethat RTGS
plusachieves its strategic, business
and technical project objectives. In addition,the Bundesbank’s most important paymentcustomers have expressed their support forthe project by making a statement that theywould use RTGS
plus.
In addition to the demand-oriented function-
ality, an optimum of availability, throughputand support are of paramount importance tocustomers. On a technical level, this meansreducing the complexity of the software to aminimum and completely redesigning theGerman RTGS system in technical terms witha view to achieving a lean system optimallygeared to the required functionality. In oper-ational terms, the RTGS system must – as faras possible – be detached from other proced-ures. Moreover, the customer relationship re-quires comprehensive and intensive support,ranging from consultation before and duringproject implementation on day-to-day oper-ations to the handling of problems and com-plaints.
EAF will close down as soon as RTGS
plusis
launched. Credit institutions not immediatelyparticipating in RTGS
plus, however, will still be
able to use ELS, albeit as an access procedureto the Bank’s large-value payment system.However, in the long run it will be uneconom-ical both for the Bundesbank as a system op-erator and for the banking industry as a userto operate ELS in parallel. For this reason, it isindispensable to concentrate on RTGS
plusas a
single interbank system for individual pay-Early availability
