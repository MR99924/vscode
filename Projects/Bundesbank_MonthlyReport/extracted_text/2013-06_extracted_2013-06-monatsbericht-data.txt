Economic conditions
Underlying trends
After the weak start to the year, real GDP is 
likely to have increased substantially in the 
second quarter of 2013. Economic indicators 
for April also suggest this. The subdued up -
ward trend in orders observed since last au -
tumn is increasingly making itself felt in indus -
trial output and exports. The construction in -
dustry is quickly making good the weather-  
related losses of the first quarter. The improved 
economic situation is also evident in business 
expectations in May.
There are indications of a slowdown in the 
pace of growth for the summer, however. Out -
put expectations were recently scaled back 
considerably for the coming months in line 
with the return to a somewhat weaker order 
inflow in April. Much the same applies to the 
export outlook in the short term. Moreover, the 
improvement on the labour market appears to 
have stalled for the time being.
Industry
Industry increased its output significantly in 
April by a seasonally adjusted 1½% on the 
month and by 2½% compared with the aver -
age of the previous quarter. In particular, manu -
facturers of capital goods recorded substantial 
growth. By contrast, the production of inter -
mediate and consumer goods remained virtu -
ally unchanged compared with the average of 
the first quarter.
In April, industrial sales rose by a seasonally ad -
justed 1% on the month. They were 2¼% up 
on the average level of the first quarter. Sales 
of capital goods, in particular, increased sharply 
in line with industrial output. In addition, sales 
of intermediate goods were somewhat higher, while sales of consumer goods did not quite 
match the level of the winter months. In a re -
gional view, small losses in sales at home coun -
terbalanced a moderate increase in sales with 
euro- area customers and a very substantial in -
crease in sales in non- euro- area countries.
The seasonally adjusted value of exported 
goods rose by 2% in April on the previous 
month and by 1¾% on the average of the pre -
vious quarter. Imports also improved distinctly 
at the beginning of spring. The seasonally ad -
justed value of imported goods increased by 
2¼% month on month and by 1½% on the 
average for the previous quarter. The recent 
decline in external trade prices meant that im -
ports, in particular, recorded even stronger 
growth in price- adjusted terms.
New orders for German industry decreased 
considerably in April, following marked growth 
in the previous two months. The reporting 
quarter was thus in line with the average of the 
first quarter in seasonally adjusted terms. While 
demand for intermediate goods recorded an 
increase of ½%, orders of capital goods de -
clined by 1¼% – due in part to comparatively 
few large orders. Orders of consumer goods in -
creased steeply by 7%. Domestic demand re -
mained 1¼% below the average of the previ -
ous quarter overall. By contrast, foreign orders 
were up 1% on the average volume of the first 
quarter. Although euro- area orders recorded a 
slight decrease, the volume of orders from 
non- euro- area countries increased distinctly 
(+2%).
Construction
Construction output recorded a substantial rise 
of 6¾% in April on the month after seasonal 
adjustment. This was driven in particular by 
catch- up effects in response to the weather-  
related downturn in construction activity previ -Subdued under-

ously. The main construction industry was dir -
ectly affected and here activity increased 
sharply by almost 17% on the month. Con -
struction output in total grew by 3% in com -
parison with the average of the previous quar -
ter. A steep increase in the main construction 
industry counterbalanced a significant decrease 
in finishing trades. In March, orders received in 
the main construction industry declined in sea -
sonally adjusted terms on the month (more 
 recent data are not yet available). In the first 
quarter overall, the volume of orders clearly 
 exceeded the fourth quarter’s level.
Labour market
There was no further rise in employment in 
April. The seasonally adjusted number of per -
sons in work in Germany remained at the pre -
vious month’s level. The year- on- year figure 
showed an increase of 277,000, or 0.7%. Ac -
cording to the initial estimate, March saw a 
slight fall in the number of employees subject 
to social security contributions following robust 
growth in the previous months, with the cold 
winter weather likely to have played a signifi -
cant role. The year- on- year increase was 
368,000 employees or 1.3%. The indicators for 
the labour market outlook give mixed signals. 
While enterprises’ willingness to recruit new 
staff has increased according to the Ifo em -
ployment barometer, the Federal Employment 
Agency’s BA-  X job index recorded a decline.
In May, the official unemployment figure in -
creased markedly by a seasonally adjusted 
21,000 to 2.96 million. However, the un -
employment rate (using the Federal Employ -
ment Agency’s definition) remained at 6.9%. 
Underemployment, as reported by the Federal 
Employment Agency, was virtually unchanged 
on the month. The seasonally adjusted number 
of jobless persons claiming insurance benefits 
rose again slightly to 991,000 and the number 
of unemployed persons receiving the basic wel -
fare allowance likewise increased somewhat 
to 1.97 million.No further

Prices
The price for a barrel of Brent crude oil in May 
virtually matched the average of the previous 
month (-¼%). Given somewhat weaker global 
economic conditions, the oil price is moving 
sideways. As this report went to press, the 
price stood at US$104. Crude oil futures were 
being quoted at a discount of US$¾ for deliv -
ery in six months and US$2¾ for delivery in 
12 months.
Import prices fell steeply in April by a seasonally 
adjusted 1.4% on the month. Energy, in par -
ticular, was cheaper, but excluding energy 
there was also a decrease of 0.7%. Prices de -
clined by 3.2% year- on- year, following -2.3% 
in March. Domestic producer prices likewise 
decreased in April by a seasonally adjusted 
0.3% on the month. The positive year- on- year 
change decreased from 0.4% to 0.1%.
Consumer prices went up by a seasonally ad -
justed 0.3% in May compared with April. 
Around two- thirds of the increase was due to 
changes in prices at state lotteries. There was a 
distinct weather-  related rise in food prices. By 
contrast, crude oil prices drove energy prices 
down. The annual rate of consumer inflation 
rose from 1.2% to 1.5% according to the na -
tional Consumer Price Index (CPI). The Harmon -
ised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), for which 
the basket does not contain gambling, rose by 
1.6% on the year, following an increase of 1.1% 
in April.
Public finances1
Public long- term care 
 insurance scheme
In the first quarter of 2013, the public long-  
term care insurance scheme recorded a virtually 
balanced budget, having posted a deficit of 
€¼  billion one year previously. Although ex -
penditure increased quite sharply (by just under 
4%), revenue rose at a considerably stronger pace (7½%). After adjustment for the increase 
in the contribution rate at the beginning of 
2013 (from 1.95% to 2.05%, plus an extra 
0.25% in each case for childless persons), em -
ployees’ contributions rose by 2½% on the 
year. However, the rate of growth was signifi -
cantly slower than in previous quarters. By con -
trast, contributions for the unemployed rose 
faster than before, climbing just under 6% 
after adjustment for the increase in the contri -
bution rate. This reflects a certain deterioration 
in labour market conditions.
The improvement in the scheme’s finances is 
due to the rise in the contribution rate, which 
is intended to fund the benefit increases agreed 
last year, particularly those for individuals suf -International

fering from dementia. Whereas higher compul -
sory contributions have an immediate impact 
on revenue flows, additional spending on 
benefits involves a certain time lag, especially 
if recipients have to apply for them first. The 
public long- term care insurance scheme is likely 
to record a marked surplus for 2013 as a whole. 
However, the recent reform has worsened its 
fundamental financial problems in connection 
with the ageing of the population.2
Securities markets
Bond market
With gross issuance of €140.3 billion in April 
2013, the issue volume in the German bond 
market rose significantly on the previous month 
(€125.7 billion). After deducting redemptions 
(€157.9 billion), which also increased, and after 
taking account of changes in issuers‘ holdings 
of their own bonds, domestic debt securities were placed in the market for a net value of 
€0.9 billion. The outstanding volume of foreign 
debt securities in Germany rose by €8.3 billion 
during the reporting month with the result that 
the overall volume of debt instruments in 
circulation in the German market grew by €9.2 
billion.
In April, the public sector issued debt securities 
worth €4.0 billion net, of which €1.6 billion 
was issued by the central government. While 
the outstanding volume of two- year Federal 
Treasury notes (Schätze) and of ten- year and 
thirty- year Federal bonds (Bunds) expanded by 
€6.6 billion, €15.9 billion, and €2.4 billion 
respectively, there were net redemptions 
particularly of five- year Federal notes (Bobls) to 
the tune of €20.9 billion.  The Federal states 
tapped the capital market for €2.4 billion on 
balance.
Domestic enterprises issued €2.5 billion worth 
of corporate bonds in net terms during the 
reporting month, compared with net issuance 
of €6.0 billion during the previous month. On 
balance, these were solely bonds with 
maturities of more than one year. Non- financial 
corporations were issuers, while non- bank 
financial enterprises redeemed bonds and 
notes in net terms.
Domestic credit institutions reduced their 
capital market debt by €5.5 billion net during 
the reporting month. In particular, debt 
securities issued by specialised credit institutions 
(which include public promotional banks, for 
example) were redeemed for a net value of 
€3.8 billion, as were, to a lesser extent, public 
Pfandbriefe for €1.6 billion in net terms.
Domestic non-  banks were the sole net 
purchasers of bonds in April (€19.5 billion). By Surplus likely

contrast, foreign investors sold interest- bearing 
paper totalling €6.8 billion net. Domestic credit 
institutions and the Bundesbank sold bonds 
amounting to €2.0 billion and €1.4 billion 
respectively.
Equity market
During the reporting month, domestic 
enterprises issued hardly any new shares on the 
German equity market (€0.1 billion). In the 
same period, the volume of foreign equities in 
the German market fell by €1.6 billion. Domestic 
investors were the sole net purchasers of 
shares. Domestic credit institutions in particular 
added €18.4 billion worth of equities to their 
portfolios, all of which were German shares on 
balance. Non- banks acquired stocks worth 
€1.8 billion net. However, non- resident 
investors sold domestic shares with a net value 
of €21.7 billion, as they have previously done 
ahead of dividend payment dates.
Mutual funds
In April, domestic mutual funds recorded 
modest net inflows of €7.5 billion. On balance, 
specialised funds reserved for institutional 
investors benefited from this in particular (€7.0 
billion). Among the asset classes, mixed 
securities-  based funds were able to sell the 
highest volume of new shares (€1.9 billion). 
Mixed funds and bond funds also recorded 
inflows, however, to the tune of €1.2 billion 
and €1.0 billion respectively. The outstanding 
volume of foreign funds distributed in Germany 
increased by €1.9 billion during the reporting 
month. In April, mutual fund shares were 
purchased mainly by domestic non- banks 
(€14.4 billion) as well as by resident credit 
institutions (€0.8 billion). By contrast, foreign 
investors sold German mutual fund shares 
worth €5.8 billion in net terms.Balance of payments
In April 2013, Germany had a current account 
surplus – in unadjusted terms – of €17.6 billion, 
down €2.9 billion on the month. This was 
partly attributable to the decline in the trade 
surplus. However, a more significant factor was 
the reduced surplus in invisible trade, which 
comprises services, income and current trans -
fers.
According to provisional figures released by the 
Federal Statistical Office, the foreign trade sur -
plus fell by €0.8 billion on the month to €18.1 
billion in April. However, after adjustment for 
seasonal and calendar variations, the surplus 
increased slightly by €0.1 billion, reaching €17.7 
billion. The value of exports went up by 1.9%, 
while the value of imports increased by 2.3%. 
After seasonal adjustment, exports grew by 
1.8% on the first quarter, while imports rose by 
1.4% in the same period. At the beginning of 
spring, prices for import goods dropped much 
more sharply than those for export goods.
In April, Germany recorded a surplus of €0.4 
billion in invisible trade, compared with €4.6 
billion in March. The smaller surplus reflected 
the decline from €6.7 billion to €1.3 billion in 
net cross- border income. This was primarily at -
tributable to the increase in dividend payments 
to non- residents. By contrast, the deficit in cur -
rent transfers improved slightly on the month, 
falling by €0.7 billion to €2.5 billion. At the 
same time, the surplus in services increased by 
€0.5 billion to €1.6 billion.
The easing political tensions in the peripheral 
euro- area countries and ongoing stabilising 
central bank measures bolstered the financial 
markets in April. Outflows of funds from Ger -
many, a safe haven, increased on balance. This 
development was reflected, in particular, in 
considerably larger net capital exports in cross- 
border portfolio investment (€41.6 billion, com -
pared with €27.1 billion in March). This was 
largely attributable to a net reduction of €34.3 
billion in foreign portfolio investment in Ger -Domestic non-

many (compared with a decrease of €12.0 bil -
lion in March). Foreign portfolio investors 
mainly offloaded German shares (€21.7 billion), 
although this has also occurred many times in 
the past ahead of dividend payment dates. 
They also disposed of German mutual fund 
shares (€5.8 billion) and debt securities (€6.8 
billion). Resident investors acquired foreign se -
curities with a total value of €7.3 billion in April. 
They added foreign debt securities (€8.3 billion) 
and mutual fund shares (€1.9 billion) to their 
portfolios and offloaded shares (€3.0 billion).
Direct investment also experienced net capital 
exports in April (€4.0 billion, compared with 
€4.2 billion in March). German enterprises pro -
vided their foreign affiliates with funds totalling 
€2.1 billion. At the same time, foreign propri -
etors withdrew €1.9 billion from their German 
subsidiaries.
In other statistically recorded investment, com -
prising financial and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank de -
posits and other assets, Germany received net 
capital inflows of €21.3 billion in April. Both 
non- bank transactions (€11.5 billion) and bank -
ing sector transactions (€9.8 billion) contrib -
uted to this. The activities of enterprises and 
households led to net capital imports of €9.9 
billion, mainly through short- term loans from 
foreign banks. General government transac -
tions resulted in inflows totalling €1.5 billion. 
While credit institutions saw net capital imports 
of €14.8 billion, the Bundesbank’s net external 
assets rose by €5.0 billion. In April, the Bundes -
bank’s higher TARGET2 claims on the ECB out -
weighed the increase in deposits held by for -
eign counterparties at the Bundesbank.

Outlook for the German economy –  
macroeconomic projections  
for 2013 and 2014
The outlook for the German economy has become brighter again following the slowdown 
towards the end of 2012. Despite the continued existence of negative factors caused by the ten -
sions in the euro area, the adjustment in the level of investment in machinery and equipment and 
exports is so far advanced that it could give way to a modest upturn. This is suggested, despite a 
few setbacks, by the improved expectations of enterprises. Although there has been no funda -
mental change in the underlying conditions, there has, above all, been no major deterioration 
either. Moreover, the world economy should pick up again in the course of this year.
In the first quarter of 2013, the incipient economic upturn was delayed by the especially persistent 
winter weather. In the second quarter, however, the improved underlying trend should come to 
the fore, reinforced by catch- up effects. If this happens, the German economy, despite the weak 
winter half year, may achieve economic growth of 0.3% (calendar- adjusted: 0.4%) on an annual 
average in 2013, compared with 0.7% (calendar- adjusted: 0.9%) in 2012. The cyclical trend, 
which is better described by the fourth- quarter annual rates, could increase initially from 0.3% in 
2012 to 1.3% in 2013 and then to 1.5% in 2014. This would also give annual average GDP growth 
of 1.5% in 2014; aggregate capacity would be well utilised, the labour market would be buoyed 
by economic activity, and, given the currently planned fiscal policy course, the general govern -
ment budget would be balanced.
Consumer price inflation (HICP) should moderate for a time, to 1.6% in 2013 and 1.5% in 2014, 
owing to the effect of declining crude oil and commodity prices. Despite waning negative exter -
nal factors, the faster pace of increase in wages, however, is likely to push up the rate excluding 
energy to 1.8% in 2014 after 1.6% in 2013.
The risks to this forecast are largely on the downside. Much will depend on whether the economic 
situation stabilises in the euro- area crisis countries and whether expansionary forces will gain the 
upper hand there. A slackening of consolidation and reform efforts, on the other hand, could 
have a negative effect on the financial markets. If greater opportunities were to present them -
selves to the German economy, however, it is likely to be in a position to use them, since enter -
prises are mostly in good shape, provision of financial resources is abundant, and immigration is 
helping to counter shortages in the labour market.Deutsche Bundesbank

Current situation
The final quarter of 2012 saw economic output 
fall by 0.7% on the quarter after seasonal and 
working-  day adjustment owing to declining ex -
ports and capital investment, which was more 
than twice as much as assumed in the Decem-
ber projection.1 The first quarter of 2013, with 
an increase of no more than 0.1%, then brought 
no more than a subdued countermovement. 
Cyclical factors were not so much the key fac -
tor behind the slow pace of growth as excep -
tionally bad weather conditions. The large 
number of frost days held up construction and 
transport sector activity, especially in March. By 
contrast, business expectations are becoming 
perceptibly brighter again, pointing to a cyclical 
improvement. Although the assessment of the business situation is no longer quite so positive, 
the early summer survey of the Association of 
German Chambers of Commerce and Industry 
(DIHK) nonetheless showed that 85% of enter -
prises continued to assess their situation as good or satisfactory despite the economic 
slowdown having persisted for some time now. This, in turn, shows that the improved shape of 
the German economy allows it to cope well 
with periods of weakness and that second-  
round effects remain within narrow bounds.
It was mainly the after-  effects of the escalation 
of the sovereign debt crises in the euro area 
and the associated adjustment recession in 
some partner countries that were weighing 
down the German economy towards the end 
of 2012. Despite ample funding resources and 
favourable financing conditions, a lack of pro -
spects for sales in Europe as well as increasing 
economic policy uncertainty led enterprises to 
cancel or, at least, to suspend further invest -
ment plans in Germany. Although corporate in -
vestment rose again somewhat in the first 
quarter in seasonally and calendar-  a djusted 
terms, it was still 5% down on the year. Against 
the backdrop of a perceptibly slower pace of 
global economic growth in the second half of 
last year, the volume of exports (as defined in 
the national accounts) declined by more than 
4% in the final quarter of last year and the first 
three months of 2013. Before that, rising de -
mand on the part of non-  eur o-  ar ea countries 
for German-  made goods was mor e than offset -
ting reduced demand from the euro area. In 
line with exports and investment, imports were 
also cut back.
Owing to temporary special factors, generally 
robust domestic economic activity did not have 
much to set against the weakness of the 
export-  oriented sectors. The r ather mild winter 
weather before the start of the new year was 
one reason for private consumption falling 
short of expectations in the final quarter of 
2012, and the finishing trades suffered from 
the fact that homeowners were adopting a waiting attitude given the prospect of add -
itional tax incentives for renovation projects. Disappointing

Although the very persistent cold weather con -
ditions boosted households’ consumption in 
the first quarter of 2013, it also acted as a brake 
on activities in the main construction sector.
Despite declining economic output, enterprises 
were recruiting more new staff again. In the 
final three months of 2012 and the first quarter 
of 2013, the seasonally adjusted number of 
employees subject to social security contribu -
tions went up by no less than 230,000, or ¾%, 
and there was also a noticeable increase in the 
total number of persons in work. This is likely 
to be due to the fact that the economic slow -
down was confined to industry, while the ser -
vices sector continued to expand. At the same 
time, unemployment increased somewhat.
As in 2012, the agreements so far in the current 
pay round, which run for between one and 
two years, are aimed at increases in wages and 
salaries of just under 3% per year. The slightly 
accelerated growth in the services sector com -
pared with previous years reflects the overall 
positive situation in the economy and on the 
labour market. In export- based industries, a 
great deal of importance continues to be at -
tached to safeguarding well- paid jobs.
As expected, consumer price inflation eased 
somewhat at the end of 2012 and in early 
2013. The annual HICP rate, which fell from 
2.0% in the final quarter of last year to 1.8% in 
the first quarter, was nevertheless higher than 
anticipated. This was chiefly due to the fact 
that chain- linking of differently calculated index 
series for accommodation services has been 
biasing the HICP upwards since January 2013.2
Major assumptions
This projection is based on assumptions made 
by the Eurosystem’s experts concerning global 
trade, exchange rates, commodity prices and 
interest rates. The assumptions are based on in -
formation available up to 14 May 2013. The as -
sumptions regarding sales markets in the euro area are derived from projections by the na -
tional central banks of the other euro- area 
countries.
Global economic activity, which lost momen -
tum last year, has picked up again somewhat. 
Nevertheless, it is not just in the euro area that 
a high debt burden and the resulting consolida -
tion pressure are holding back economic 
growth. Although the financial markets have 
become somewhat calmer, confidence has not 
yet been fully restored and heightened uncer -
tainty is restricting the propensity to invest. 
Even so, the forces of growth should gradually 
gain the upper hand. It is expected that the 
cyclical upturn in the industrial countries will 
become perceptibly stronger, supported by a 
decidedly expansionary monetary policy, and 
that the emerging economies will be able to 
step up their pace of growth again. However, 
on an average of the current year, the global 
expansion, at 3%, will be still more or less as 
moderate as it was last year; next year, it could 
then be approaching the multi- year average, at 
3¾%.
Euro- area economic output continued to con -
tract in the first quarter of 2013. The negative 
effects of the debt crisis are still the predomin -
ant factor. Investment is being constrained not 
only by the persistently elevated level of uncer -
tainty but also by marked capacity underutilisa -
tion in some countries. High unemployment is 
weighing on private consumption. At the same 
time, adjustment in cost structures is also pro -
gressing, and many enterprises successfully im -
proved their market position abroad last year. It 
therefore appears likely that the euro- area 
economy will stabilise over the course of the 
year, followed by gradual recovery. After a con -
traction of economic output by 0.6% in 2013 
(caused by a negative statistical carry- over and 
a weak start to the year), GDP growth of 1.1% 
in 2014 could ensue. A robust economic recov -Sharp rise in

ery will continue to hinge on a continuation of 
consolidation and reform efforts so as to allow 
confidence in a sustainable improvement to 
grow.
The sluggish pace of global activity has put a 
considerable damper on the growth of world 
trade, from which Germany has reaped great 
benefit in the past few years. It is particularly 
the global dent in industrial activity which has 
weighed on international trade. The expected 
acceleration of global economic growth is likely 
to be associated with an increase in the de -
mand for industrial products, too. However, as 
in the previous year, world trade is expected to 
grow only by an annual average rate of 3% in 
2013. Next year, the growth rate could acceler -
ate to 6%, which would put it close to its 
multi- year average. Although German export -
ers are likely to benefit from the probable resur -
gence of economic growth among the emer -
ging market economies and improved eco -
nomic activity in the industrial countries, they 
are being hurt by the difficult conditions in the 
euro area, which, despite growing regional di -
versification, still accounts for nearly two- fifths 
of German exports. Germany’s sales markets 
are likely to see growth of only 1¼% this year 
and possibly 4½% next year, which will put it 
markedly behind the growth of world trade. 
Each figure is just over 1 percentage point less 
than assumed in the December projection.
The euro appreciated significantly after publica -
tion of the December projection; it peaked in 
February but has gone back down since then. 
In the period that is relevant to the derivation 
of the exchange rate assumptions, the euro 
stood at US$1.31, 2¼% higher than assumed 
in the December projection. Measured by the 
effective exchange rate, which is relevant for 
foreign trade, the euro has appreciated by just 
under 4% since December.
Crude oil prices rose considerably in the winter 
months, though this increase was tempered by 
the appreciating euro. The situation has eased 
markedly in the past few months, however. Fu -tures prices are pointing downwards across all 
delivery periods; therefore, an average price 
per barrel of Brent of US$105½ for the current 
year and US$100 for 2014 is being assumed in 
the current projection round. This corresponds 
largely to the assumptions in the December 
projection. In euro terms, prices will be 1¾% 
lower this year and 2¾% lower next year.
International food, beverages and tobacco 
prices dropped more sharply in the fourth quar -
ter of 2012 and first quarter of 2013 than an -
ticipated in the December projection. Although 
these prices are expected to go back up during 
the projection horizon, they will not reach the 
level assumed in December. The prices for all 
other commodities, under the influence of 
sluggish global economic activity, are once 
again likely to fall considerably in 2013 and 
then rise slightly in 2014. Throughout the pro -
jection horizon, these prices, too, will fail to 
reach the levels projected in December.
Persistently weak economic activity in the euro 
area and the stubborn disruptions caused by 
the debt crises prompted the Governing Coun -
cil of the ECB in early May to cut the interest 
rate on the Eurosystem’s main refinancing op -
erations to a new all-  time low. This decision 
had little impact on expectations regarding the 
path of short- term interest rates. As before, an 
average three- month interest rate for un -
secured transactions on the interbank market 
of 0.2% for the current year and 0.3% for 2014 
is assumed. The yield on nine to ten- year Ger -
man government bonds rose in the first quarter 
to a level slightly above December’s projection. 
It is expected to go back down in the second 
quarter, however, followed by a slight increase 
over the rest of the projection horizon resulting 
from the yield curve. Overall, at 1.5% in 2013 
and 1.8% in 2014, yields will remain 10 basis 
points behind the December assumptions in 
each of those years, still driven by increased de -
mand for safe and liquid instruments.

ent with assumptions about the development 
of three- month interest rates and yields on 
long- term government bonds, a steady slight 
increase is expected to begin in the current year 
and continue throughout the projection hori -
zon. However, lending rates for enterprises and 
consumers remain at a very low level. Banks 
once again eased their credit standards some -
what for loans to enterprises in the first quarter 
of 2013. According to the Bank Lending Survey, 
hardly any change in credit standards is ex -
pected for the second quarter. The share of en -
terprises which complain of constrained access 
to bank lending remains very low according to 
an Ifo Institute survey. On the whole, financing 
conditions are still being regarded as exception -
ally favourable, with no worsening in sight over 
the projection horizon.
For public finances, the projection incorporates 
all measures which have either already been 
approved by parliament or have, at least, been 
defined in detail and are likely to be imple -
mented.3 The measures included here will im -
pose a limited burden on the general govern -
ment budget in 2013 and will be close to neu -
tral in 2014. The most substantial measure in 
terms of its fiscal impact will be the lowering of 
the statutory pension contribution rate from 
19.6% to 18.9% at the beginning of this year. 
With regard to taxes, the shortfalls caused by 
the two- stage increase in the basic income tax 
allowance and the gradual changeover to a 
downstream taxation of pensions outweigh 
additional revenue obtained elsewhere. On the 
expenditure side, inter alia  the abolition of the 
surgery visit charge and the introduction of the 
childcare supplement are imposing burdens.
Cyclical outlook4
In Germany, enterprises’ business expectations 
have recovered from their trough in summer 
2012. Enterprises are also assessing their 
medium- term outlook more optimistically. Al -
though new orders received by industry 
showed, after seasonal adjustment, only a slight quarter- on- quarter gain in the first quar -
ter of 2013, they picked up steam across the 
board over the course of the quarter. This 
means the conditions are in place for the Ger -
man economy to continue down the path on 
which it had embarked in the first quarter of 
the year. Economic growth is likely even to be 
quite strong in the second quarter, as a large 
share of the weather- related output losses 
from the first quarter of the year will probably 
be recouped quickly. The growth rate is likely 
subsequently to ease markedly.
Over the course of 2013, the German economy 
could grow at a rate of 1.3% owing to rising 
exports and a pick- up of domestic demand, 
putting it on par with potential output. This 
would result, despite the weak period of the 
fourth quarter of 2012 and first quarter of 
2013, in average annual GDP growth of 0.3% 
for 2013 (0.4% after adjustment for calendar 
effects). Provided the pace of global economic 
activity accelerates and the euro- area crisis 
countries’ economies gradually return to a path 
of expansion, GDP growth could improve Financing

to 1.5% over the course of the following year. 
In annual average terms, output growth would 
then also be 1.5% for 2014. On the whole, 
Germany’s economy would consequently be 
operating in the area of normal aggregate cap -
acity utilisation across the entire projection 
horizon. Compared with the December 2012 
projection, this means a scaling back of growth 
expectations by 0.1 percentage point for 2013 
and 0.4 percentage point for 2014. This is due 
mainly to downward revisions with regard to 
the external environment.
For Germany to undergo a sustained cyclical re -
covery, the weakness in exports has to be over -come, given the high degree of openness of its 
economy and also its pattern of specialisation. 
Both foreign orders, which were tending up -
ward over the course of the first quarter, and 
the export expectations of German industry are 
pointing to an improvement in the situation. 
However, export expectations fell short of their 
multi-  year average. This is consistent with the 
anticipated, and initially muted, growth of sales 
markets. Owing to product range effects – 
high- end, durable industrial goods which are 
currently in less demand are a particularly im -
portant element of German exports – Germa -
ny’s sales abroad this year could even fall slightly 
short of last year’s figures. This is being indi -
cated, at least, by the sharp drop in exports as 
defined in the national accounts in the period 
spanning the fourth quarter of 2012 and first 
quarter of 2013. In the wake of a livelier global 
economy and the nascent recovery in the euro 
area, exports are then expected to grow more 
sharply, which means that average growth in 
exports of 4½% for 2014 appears to be pos -
sible. Export growth will be sustained in large 
part by increasing demand from outside the 
euro area; no meaningful stimuli from the euro 
area are expected until 2014 at the earliest.
The adjustment in the level of corporate invest -
ment caused by an increase in perceived risk 
and a downward revision in the sales outlook 
for the euro area appears to have been com -
pleted in the first quarter of 2013. This is prob -
ably because replacement of fixed capital is 
now gaining in importance again. As industrial 
capacity utilisation rises, the propensity to in -
vest should continue to increase, which would 
result in a perceptible growth stimulus in the 
coming year. However, the persistent economic 
policy uncertainty and the gloomier outlook for 
European sales markets are likely to stand in 
the way of exceptionally strong investment ac -
tivity.
Residential construction is benefiting not only 
from strong demand for safe capital invest -
ments but also from a primary increase in de -
mand for housing, at least in urban centres. Exports over-
come weaknessCorporate  investment has bottomed out

This is indicated not least by rents for new let -
tings, which are rising, in some cases sharply. In 
this environment, the number of construction 
permits for multiple family dwellings, in par -
ticular, saw strong growth. Following major im -
pediments to construction activity in the first 
quarter of 2013 caused by the especially long 
and cold winter, catch- up effects in the second 
and third quarters of the year are likely to give 
construction investment a major boost. Invest -
ment in residential property could subsequently 
continue to tend upwards but is likely to largely 
maintain its current elevated level. The long-  
term demographic outlook militates against a 
stronger construction boom.
Following the strong decline in 2012, caused by 
the expiry of the economic stimulus pro -
grammes, general government investment is ex -
pected to stabilise in the wake of higher spend -
ing on infrastructure in the current year and 
could then go back up in the following year.
Despite increased investment in residential con -
struction, gross fixed capital formation will still 
decline slightly overall by ½% on average in 
2013 but is then looking at a strong 3¾% in -
crease in 2014. The contribution of inventory 
investment to growth is likely to be neutral in 
2013 and slightly positive in 2014.
Private consumption is likely to generate signifi -
cantly stronger momentum over the projection 
period than in the recent past. This is indicated 
by the upward trend in employment in connec -
tion with sharper increases in wages and the 
easing of price pressures. With an increase of 
¾%, households’ real disposable income 
should grow somewhat more strongly this year 
than last year. This increase could reach 1¼% 
next year. Furthermore, consumer sentiment 
has improved considerably as a result of 
brighter income prospects and reduced job un -
certainty; this has been accompanied by a 
slight decrease in the saving rate. This is cur -
rently subject to opposing forces. Although the 
extraordinarily low interest rates imply a higher 
propensity to consume, at the same time, they reduce future income and expenditure oppor -
tunities if saving habits remain unchanged. The 
high levels of residential property acquisition at 
present may increase demand for durable con -
sumer goods in the short term, but, looking 
ahead, is also likely to require households to 
make additional savings. This projection there -
fore assumes that the saving rate will not fall 
any further but will remain at a level of 10%. 
Private consumption would then grow by 1% 
this year and by 1¼% next year.
Growth rates in government consumption are 
expected to see a slight pick- up this year fol -
lowed by a sharper increase in 2014. Health -
care spending is likely to experience acceler -
ated growth again after the expiry of measures 
to reduce expenditure. Spending on personnel 
and intermediate consumption is also expected 
to expand more rapidly, not least due to the 
relatively favourable budget situation.
As exports and investment in machinery and 
equipment recover, imports should rise again 
sharply. However, like exports, average imports 
in 2013 are likely to be affected by the weak 
final quarter of 2012 and first quarter of 2013, 
meaning there will be no increase year- on- year.

towards a higher share of imports, particularly 
in exports and investment in machinery and 
equipment, will continue. Against this back -
drop, imports could increase more sharply at 
6% than exports next year. Enterprises in euro- 
area partner countries are likely to continue to 
play a disproportionately large role in the 
growth of German imports. This is suggested 
by the improvement in price competitiveness 
and the efforts of enterprises in these countries 
to tap new sales markets in light of weak do -
mestic demand. Furthermore, German enter -
prises can use free capacities elsewhere. The 
current account surplus is likely to fall to 6½% of nominal GDP this year and to just under 6% 
next year due to livelier import activity.
Labour market
Contrary to the assumptions of the December 
projection, and despite sales losses, enterprises 
hired large numbers of additional staff in the 
final quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 
2013. Structural improvements therefore ap -
pear to be outweighing economic pressures. 
Additional numbers of skilled workers migrat -
ing from abroad may have played an important 
role here. Business surveys indicate that al -
though the positive employment trend could 
weaken, it essentially remains in place. After 
the number of persons in work rose by just 
over 1% in 2012, it could climb by just over ½% 
in 2013 and by just under ½% in 2014. How -
ever, there could be a further reduction in 
working hours due to the growing share of 
part- time work. This trend will probably be 
amplified through cyclical limitations and a 
negative calendar effect in 2013, but is likely to 
be balanced out in 2014 as economic condi -
tions improve. The number of hours worked 
could therefore stagnate this year, but then in -
crease again by just under ½%.
High levels of immigration are easing the sup -
ply shortages on the German labour market. 
Due to the difficult labour market situation in 
euro- area crisis countries and the continuing 
prosperity gap in central and eastern European 
countries, Germany will probably continue to 
see substantial migration gains in the next few 
years. It is unlikely that immigration will reach 
the levels seen in 2012, when almost 370,000 
people migrated to Germany on balance, be -
cause this reflected one- off effects such as the 
granting of freedom of movement to the ac -
cession countries in spring 2011. However, a 
net inflow of 300,000 people per year may be 
expected for the projection period.

tributable to the fact that the number of un -Rise in employ-

employed persons did not rise more sharply 
despite the cyclical downturn. If economic mo -
mentum continues as expected over the pro -
jection horizon, unemployment figures as a 
whole are likely to remain largely unchanged. 
An average of 2.9 million people would there -
fore be expected to be unemployed in 2013 
and 2014. This would be equivalent to un -
employment rates of 6.8% and 6.7% respect -
ively according to the national definition, and 
5.3% and 5.2% as defined by the International 
Labour Organization (ILO).
Labour costs and prices
The 2012 and 2013 pay round settlements, 
which are mainly aimed at securing a wage in -
crease of just under 3% per year, are having a 
larger and larger impact on the overall wage 
trend in the economy. The rise in negotiated 
rates of pay (as defined in the Bundesbank’s 
negotiated pay rate statistics) is expected to in -
crease from 2.5% in 2012 to 2.7% in 2013 and 
to 2.9% in 2014. Actual earnings are likely to 
grow somewhat more slowly than negotiated 
wages over the projection horizon due to 
working hours effects and smaller bonus pay -
ments. Reductions in social security contribu -
tions are also helping to slow the increase in 
labour costs. As a consequence, compensation 
per employee should rise 2¼% this year and 
2¾% next year.
Given the extremely subdued productivity 
growth, the trend in labour costs will make for 
a considerable increase in unit labour costs of 
2½% this year and of just over 1½% next year, 
following a rise of almost 3% in 2012. This is 
mainly because of the decision of employers to 
hire more staff despite sluggish economic activ -
ity and deteriorating expectations. This reflects 
structural improvements on the labour market. 
As a result, the sharp rise in unit wage costs is 
expected to compromise margins and raise la -
bour’s share in national income again slightly. 
However, this will be countered in the short 
term by the improvement in the terms of trade which is expected due to the sharp drop in 
crude oil prices in spring 2013. The GDP defla -
tor is therefore likely to increase by 1¾% this 
year and 1½% next year, having risen by 1¼% 
in 2012. The trend towards increased domestic -
ally generated inflation would therefore con -
tinue over the projection horizon. In the me -
dium term, a steady rise in wages of 3% is 
likely to lead to a 2% pa increase in the price 
index for domestic value added.
However, pressure on consumer prices is initially 
expected to abate. The annual rate of HICP in -
flation could fall from 2.1% in 2012 to 1.6% this 
year and 1.5% next year. This is due in large part 
to the easing of prices on the international com -
modities markets. The significant drop in crude 
oil prices in particular – which are projected to 
continue to fall – is giving relief to households. 
The international markets should not generate 
any more marked inflationary effects in terms of 
food prices, either. Excluding energy, however, 
inflation is likely to increase from 1.6% this year Wage agree-
ments rise 3%

to 1.8% next year. This is due mainly to the 
sharper acceleration in wages, which is raising 
costs and boosting demand. Cost consider -
ations are likely to be particularly important in 
the area of public and private services, but also 
in the retail sector. Increases in income will tend 
to accelerate the rise in housing rents.
Public finances
Last year, the general government fiscal bal -
ance continued to improve significantly, post -
ing a small surplus for the first time since the 
pre- crisis year of 2007. However, with a GDP 
structure yielding more revenue due to the 
larger proportion of wages and salaries, as well 
as lower unemployment figures and interest 
rates, the conditions for public finances were 
significantly more favourable than in 2007. 
There are no signs of any major changes to the 
fiscal balance this year or next year if the cur -
rent fiscal policy stance is maintained. How -ever, considerable risks to public finances still 
exist overall, due mainly to uncertainties sur -
rounding the debt crisis in the euro area.
This year, the fiscal balance will probably ini -
tially slip slightly into deficit, because the posi -
tive cyclical component that prevailed last year 
is likely to be reduced. On the revenue side, 
with the current economic downturn it is as -
sumed that the strong recovery in tax revenue, 
after the slump in the crisis year of 2009, has 
come to a halt. The (limited) cuts in taxes and 
social contributions will be largely compen -
sated for by the growth structure, which will 
continue to yield a relatively high revenue, and 
fiscal drag5, meaning that the revenue ratio is 
unlikely to change much despite the shortfalls. 
On the expenditure side, the measures adding 
to expenditure will be countered by the further 
reductions expected in interest expenditure re -
sulting from favourable refinancing conditions. 
Nonetheless, the expenditure ratio is expected 
to rise as a result of weak nominal GDP growth 
in the denominator for cyclical reasons. Be -
cause the mildly expansionary policy will be off -
set by a further decline in interest expenditure, 
the cyclically adjusted balance remains almost 
unchanged as things stand.
If current fiscal plans are maintained, the fiscal 
balance could improve next year, resulting in 
another small surplus. The additional budgetary 
burdens caused by the new childcare supple -
ment, for example, or in the areas of health -
care and residential long- term care, would be 
smaller overall than in 2013 and would be more 
than offset in particular by the continuous eas -
ing in interest expenditure. According to the 
projection presented here, the cyclical situation 
still has a neutral effect on public finances.

ing developments at different levels of govern -
ment and in social security funds. Social secur -
ity funds will probably largely use up their very 
large surplus in the current year, mainly as a 
result of the lower pension contribution rate, a 
sharper increase in pension and healthcare ex -
penditure and a shift in burdens from central 
government. By contrast, the budgets of the 
various levels of government are gradually im -
proving owing to the shift in burdens and, in 
particular, to lower interest payments and fiscal 
drag.
In comparison to the pre- crisis year of 2007, the 
EDP debt ratio has risen sharply from 65.2% 
to 81.9%. Uncertainty about future develop -
ments is particularly high due to the debt crises. 
As things stand, the debt ratio is expected to fall 
significantly in 2013 and 2014. Although exist -
ing deficits at some levels of government and 
payments agreed as part of the euro- area assis -
tance mechanisms will increase gross debt, ac -
cording to this projection, these factors will be 
outweighed by the increase in nominal GDP in 
the ratio’s denominator and the reduction of li -
abilities at the government- owned “bad banks”.
Risk assessment
This projection assumes that the economic situ -
ation will stabilise in the euro- area crisis coun -
tries and expansionary forces will gradually 
gain the upper hand. There are encouraging 
signs that this will happen. On the other hand, 
consolidation and reform efforts appear to be 
slackening. This could have a negative effect 
on the financial markets and further intensify 
the debt crises. Confidence would then be fur -
ther eroded, which would also have negative 
consequences for the cyclical outlook for the 
German economy. The sustained global eco -
nomic revival is another important prerequisite 
for the growth path presented here. However, 
some emerging market economies are showing 
cyclical slowdowns as well as structural distor -
tions, which could impair demand for German 
products. The risks to this projection in the real economy are therefore largely on the down -
side. This goes hand in hand with the risk that 
further negative shocks will disrupt the stability 
of the labour market and trigger downward 
multiplier effects. However, if international and 
European developments are more positive than 
assumed in this projection, the German econ -
omy is likely to be in a position to use the op -
portunities that arise, since most enterprises 
are in quite good shape, provision of financial 
resources is abundant, and immigration is help -
ing to counter shortages in the labour market.
There is a certain contrast in the underlying 
conditions of this projection between the posi -
tive expectations for the global economy and 
the fall in crude oil prices derived technically 
from futures prices. In particular, the strong 
growth expected to take place in the emerging 
market economies has been accompanied by 
an increase in energy consumption in the past. 
The risks to consumer prices in the projection 
period are therefore more on the upside.Decline in cen-

Household wealth and finances in Germany: 
results of the Bundesbank survey
The Bundesbank conducted a detailed survey of 3,565 households between September 2010 and 
July 2011 to obtain, for the first time, micro data on households’ wealth and debt in Germany. 
Extensive work having been devoted to preparing the statistical data, initial results of the survey 
are now presented here. The wealth of an “average” household (median wealth) appears to be 
comparatively low and the distribution of wealth – measured against other euro- area countries – 
is rather uneven (although significantly more even than in other industrial countries such as the 
USA or Switzerland). There are a number of different approaches to explaining this. Among other 
things, it is apparent that property owners are considerably wealthier than tenant households. At 
the same time, the home ownership rate in Germany is relatively low. The broad and efficient 
market for rented accommodation seems to make the need to buy property less urgent. Positive 
relationships exist between wealth on the one hand and income and education on the other. 
However, other household characteristics may obscure these relationships. For instance, self-  
employed households – including those with low income – which have to make their own provi -
sion for retirement strive more to accumulate wealth, whereas there appears to be less need to 
build up private wealth among households which stand to benefit more from the state security 
system. The study – Panel on Household Finances or PHF – also shows that households endeav -
our through their saving decisions to offset income fluctuations over their life cycle. Young and 
old households save little or not at all, whereas families in the middle age categories are most 
likely to accumulate wealth. Finally, this article examines German household debt. In contrast 
with the situation in a number of other countries, overindebtedness is not a widespread phenom -
enon in Germany.Deutsche Bundesbank

Unlike in the USA, for instance, there have so 
far been no detailed and harmonised micro 
data on household wealth in the euro area. 
Such data, which provide information not only 
about the aggregate, but also about wealth 
relative to different household characteristics, 
help central banks to assess the effect of their 
monetary policy and potential risks to financial 
stability. For example, wealthy households react 
differently to changing interest rates than in -
debted or low- wealth households. Against this 
background, work began on a joint survey of 
household wealth and finances, the Household 
Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS), in the 
Eurosystem in 2006. Whereas some countries 
such as Italy and Spain had already been con -
ducting regular household surveys which met 
the Eurosystem’s requirements and could serve 
as a basis for the joint survey, a new study had 
to be carried out for the Bundesbank. This 
study bore the title “Panel on Household 
 Finances” (PHF).1
Because the structure of the subsamples in the 
HFCS is designed to allow international com -
parability, it is also possible to compare the 
overall picture for Germany with the structures 
in other countries of the euro area and be -
yond.2
The PHF’s definition  
of wealth
At the heart of the PHF study lies the prepar -
ation of a balance sheet for households in Ger -
many. The study focuses on households3 and 
not, for example, on individuals, since it is as -
sumed that major financial decisions such as 
buying a house are usually made at the house -
hold level. However, the study also provides 
data on employment, income and retirement 
provision for all household members aged 16 
and over. The households are asked about non- 
financial assets (in particular, real estate and 
business assets), financial assets and liabilities. 
A total of more than 25 asset and debt items 
are surveyed. The detailed breakdown of assets is important not only for the analysis itself: it 
also helps in obtaining a clearer picture of 
wealth as a whole, as it reduces the risk of in -
dividual asset items being forgotten. As the 
survey seeks to capture a household’s assets in 
their entirety, it is irrelevant whether the assets 
are held in Germany or abroad (eg a holiday 
home).
Besides questions about wealth itself, the ques -
tionnaire also asks for details about the house -
holds, such as the size of the household or the 
age and education of the household members. 
This facilitates a more precise picture of the re -
lationship between these characteristics and 
(the composition of) wealth, in turn granting 
access to the underlying determinants.
The values reported are assessments made by 
the respondents themselves. This applies in 
particular to real estate values and the market 
value of a business owned by the household. 
These self- assessments are often crucial in 
terms of the behaviour of households; and al -
though they may be flawed, it is possible in 
some cases at least to identify substantial errors 
because, for example, not only the actual 
value, but also other information about the 
residential property or the business in question 
is available.
For the purpose of the PHF study, questions are 
asked about assets for private retirement provi -
sion (for example, under the Riester pension 
scheme). These assets are included in house -Data on house-

1 The main aspects of the methodology (sample design, 
course of the field work, comparison with reference statis -
tics, households’ response behaviour) were presented in 
the Deutsche Bundesbank Monthly Report, January 2012 
(The PHF: a survey of household wealth and finances in 
Germany).

and Consumption Survey – Results from the First Wave,

3 The PHF defines households as groups of persons whose 
centre of life is at a shared address and who share daily 
expenses. Persons who temporarily do not live at that ad -
dress but regularly return there are also considered part of 
the household. Persons or groups of persons who live in a 
flat- sharing community without having a family or partner -
ship relationship, or domestic staff residing at that address, 
constitute households in their own right.Deutsche Bundesbank

hold wealth. By contrast, households’ capital -
ised claims arising from civil servants’ or public 
pensions and other social security benefits are 
not included in the calculation of wealth re -
ported here. Generally speaking, it would have 
been desirable to include them, as the insured 
persons’ public pension entitlements and the 
entitlements of civil servants vis- à- vis their pub -
lic- sector employers constitute an important 
part of households’ retirement provisioning. It 
is not easy to “capture” or “include” this par -
ticular type of asset, however, and it can give 
rise to new problems. Above all, decisions have 
to be made about the methodological proced -
ure, and additional assumptions also need to 
be made in order to calculate pension entitle -
ments. For example, the expected future pay -
ments would first have to be reliably calculated 
and then capitalised. In order to determine, 
say, the net present value of pension entitle -
ments, a number of assumptions – including 
about the person’s life expectancy, retirement 
age and, where appropriate, the taxation of 
pension payments – would need to be made. 
Moreover, a discount factor would have to be 
chosen.4
Apart from that, the character of social security 
funds as pay- as- you- go systems has to be kept 
in mind. The insured households largely finance 
the social insurance systems and their implicit 
liabilities themselves through social contribu -
tions. If this wealth component were included, 
a notional capital stock would be added to the 
wealth reported directly in the PHF. What is 
more, a contributory social insurance system 
entails an intertemporal and an interpersonal 
redistribution, but not an increase in the aggre -
gated total assets in the sense of greater con -
sumption possibilities.
Because these entitlements are excluded, how -
ever, payroll employees’ assets are presented in 
too unfavourable a light compared with those 
of the self- employed. At all events, this concep -
tual approach should, as a general rule, be 
borne in mind when interpreting the data.Distribution of wealth  
in Germany
According to the PHF, at the end of 2010, 
households in Germany owned gross mean 
wealth of €222,000; after deducting debt, net 
mean wealth is calculated at €195,200. By 
comparison, the median – ie the value that div -
ides households into a wealthier and a poorer 
half – is significantly lower. The median of gross 
wealth is €67,900, while the median of net 
wealth amounts to €51,400. Other similar 
studies for Germany, such as the Federal Statis -

Coverage of the total assets in the sector
The main objective of the Panel on House-
hold Finances (Private Haushalte und ihre 
Finanzen, or PHF) is to identify relationships 
between wealth components and obtain 
information about the distribution and 
composition of wealth at household level in 
Germany. Information about macroeco-nomic aggregates is primarily acquired through other statistics, most notably the 
Bundesbank’s fi  nancial accounts. However, 
it is interesting to gauge how closely the 
data gathered from the PHF survey corres-
pond to the macroeconomic aggregates. 
This comparison also allows areas in which values have been under or over- reported to be identifi  ed.
This article will therefore compare the ag-gregate values extrapolated from the PHF 
with estimates based on the wealth statis-
tics of the Bundesbank’s fi  nancial accounts 
and the Federal Statistical Offi   ce’s fi  xed 
assets accounts. In comparing these fi  gures, it should be noted that there may be several 
reasons for any differences between the 
values calculated for the population. These differences include, among others,
– Differences in how the population is de-
fi  ned: the data in the fi  nancial accounts 
and the fi  xed assets accounts relate to 
households and non- profi  t organisations 
serving households. The latter, which in-
clude churches, charitable associations, foundations and societies, for example, 
do not form part of the PHF’s target ref-
erence population. People living in insti-
tutions (retirement homes, medical insti-tutions, prisons, barracks, asylum centres, 
homeless shelters) were not included in 
the survey either.
– Differences in the defi  nition of the rele-
vant wealth aggregates: in the fi  nancial accounts, for example, in accordance with methodological requirements, pri-
vate limited companies owned by house-holds are valued using a standard fi  gure 
of €25,000 to represent shares or com-
mon equity contributed by the partners. The PHF, by contrast, uses the net values 
specifi  ed by the households for enter-
prises. This explains the large difference 
between the two sets of statistics in the “other equity” category.
– 
Under- reported or incorrectly reported 
values in one of the two statistical refer-ence systems: when taking part in a sur-
vey, households may accidentally –  or 
sometimes even deliberately – fail to de-
clare the full extent of their wealth or 
debt. This is more likely in the case of fi  -nancial assets than real assets (real estate 
and business assets) due to the large number of fi  nancial asset items, and in the case of consumer loans than mort-
gages due to different levels of social ac-
ceptance. Equally, some parts of the 
macroeconomic system of accounts are 
based on extrapolations (housing wealth) 
and estimates. The survey data also re-fl  ect households’ own assessments of their various assets and debts, while valuations in the fi  nancial accounts are made primarily on the basis of market 
prices. Finally, it must be borne in mind 
in the comparison that the very wealthy German households are not typically rep-
resented in the samples of a survey. Be-
cause a signifi  cant proportion of wealth 
is owned by these households, however, part of the wealth is missing in compari-son to the aggregates due to the survey methods used. This has an impact on ex-
trapolated values and mean values in 
particular.Deutsche Bundesbank

The comparison should therefore be re-
garded as indicative and examines whether 
the survey and the wealth statistics give a 
picture of the “same country”. It also iden-
tifi  es areas in which there may be large- 
scale under- reporting.
Overall, the PHF’s coverage of household 
wealth can be described as good. The PHF 
covers almost 90% of the net wealth of the 
“households” sector (including non- profi  t organisations serving households). How-
ever, some items show discrepancies which partially offset each other.
– 
As in many other comparable studies, 
gross fi  nancial assets are under- reported. 
The fi  gure reported in the survey only 
adds up to around half (47%) the fi  gure 
in the macroeconomic fi  nancial accounts if equity investment is excluded. If equity investment is taken into account, despite the abovementioned differences in valu-
ation, the PHF captures 72% of the ag-
gregate fi  nancial assets of households 
and non- profi  t institutions serving house-holds. For the reasons mentioned above, 
the value of the equity investments is much higher in the PHF (and probably also closer to the true fi  gure). This only partially “compensates” for the under- reporting of other fi  nancial assets com-
ponents. If common fi  nancial asset types 
(eg savings accounts balances) are 
under- reported, and this under- reporting is “compensated” for by business assets, which is a rare asset type, this is likely to have an impact on the distribution.
– 70% of debt is recorded. This is largely a 
result of the under- reporting of con-
sumer loans.
– The extrapolated values for housing wealth and associated debt correspond 
very closely to the marginal distributions. This is an area in which the PHF data are 
extremely reliable, which is, again, a  result of the survey methods used. This is  important because housing wealth  accounts for a major part of the total 
assets.Selected assets and liabilities of households’ balance sheets in Germany –

of the German Institute for Economic Research 
(DIW), show similar findings in this respect.
Both figures appear rather modest by inter -
national standards. The HFCS puts median net 
wealth at €140,200 for the euro area excluding 
Germany.5 The corresponding mean value is 
€245,400. There are a number of possible ex -
planations for this, ranging from lower inherit -
ances in Germany – resulting from the long-  
term after- effects of the lost war and the low 
level of capital accumulation in eastern Ger -
many before reunification – to differences in 
household and employment structures.6
The great difference between the mean value 
and the median and the fact that 73% of 
households have below- average wealth point 
to a pronounced inequality in wealth in Ger -
many. This picture is confirmed by traditional 
distribution measures such as the Gini index or 
the share of total wealth accounted for by the 
wealthiest 10% of households. The Gini index 
is calculated at 75.8% in the case of net 
wealth.7 The wealthiest 10% of households 
own 59.2% of net wealth. By comparison, the 
Gini index for the euro area (excluding Ger -
many) comes to 63%, and 46.5% belongs to 
the wealthiest 10% of households. On the 
other hand, wealth is still distributed consider -
ably more evenly in Germany than in the USA 
or Switzerland, for example.
This picture may be the outcome of many fac -
tors. The overview of the size of household 
wealth and its characteristics as well as the 
composition of wealth provide clues to a better 
understanding of the size and distribution of 
wealth. However, the analyses presented below 
are largely bivariate, ie they examine the link 
between individual characteristics of the house -
holds and wealth in isolation. However, a 
household’s finances are the result of a com -
bination of many characteristics. Individual 
characteristics also affect one another; this is 
the case, for example, with education and in -
come. For this reason, these relationships will 
have to be subjected to thorough and exten -sive analyses before a definitive conclusion can 
be reached.
One striking point revealed by the PHF is the 
close connection between property ownership 
and wealth. In Germany, tenant households 
have a mean net wealth of €47,800. This is 
considerably lower than that of residential 
property- owning households: the net wealth of 
owners with a mortgage is roughly five times 
higher, while that of owners without a mort -
gage is as much as ten times higher. The bor -
derline that divides the poorer 90% and the 
wealthiest 10% of tenants is around €99,000 
in terms of net wealth. By comparison, a house -
hold must have a net wealth of at least 
€737,600 to belong to the wealthiest 10% of 
property- owning households without a mort -
gage.
A European cross- section likewise reveals a 
positive relationship between home ownership 
rate and wealth. In Austria and Germany, 
where fewer than half of the households own 
their homes, the medians for net wealth, at 
€76,400 and €51,400 respectively, are consid -
erably lower than in countries with a home 
ownership rate higher than 50%. For example, 
households in Spain (which has a home owner -
ship rate of 83%) hold median net wealth of 
€182,700. In Italy (69%) and France (55%), me -
dian net wealth comes to €173,500 and 
€115,800 respectively.
This relationship may be direct or indirect if

hold or the age of the head of the household –

real estate ownership and wealth. Even when a 
direct relationship exists, however, the causality 
is not immediately obvious. Do wealthy house -
holds buy real estate properties, or does the 
purchase of properties make households 
wealthy? It is important to have a better under -
standing of the cause and effect relationships. 
If, for instance, the government seeks to pro -
mote the purchase of residential properties in 
order to increase the wealth of broad sections 
of the population, that appears to have the de -
sired effect if the second case is true; in the first 
case, it may even be counter- productive.
If one assumes that the purchase of a property 
essentially constitutes a change in the compos -
ition of assets, one might at first expect tenant 
households to hold more financial assets. The 
figures paint a different picture. Most tenant 
households also have fewer financial assets 
(median: €7,600) than home- owners (median: 
around €34,000). Thus, they lack the funds 
that may be used at a later point in time to buy 
a property. Basically, this is the combined effect 
of two factors. First, tenants have a lower in -
come than owners, and therefore less oppor -
tunity to accumulate financial assets. Second, 
there are differences between the two groups’ 
saving and consumption behaviour (see the 
chart on page 30).The mean net income8 of tenant households is 
around €23,600 per annum; by comparison, 
home-  owner households have a mean net in -
come of €41,200. Tenants’ low income offers 
less scope for substantial savings and would 
also restrict the possible amount of a mortgage 
loan that would have to be repaid, as higher 
principal and interest payments are actually not 
possible. On the other hand, there is no way of 
knowing to what extent income itself depends 
on whether a household desires to purchase 
residential real estate. For instance, households 
could take steps to improve their job opportun -
ities or increase their income by means of bet -
ter education or training.
Moreover, the PHF shows that tenant house -
holds – both in absolute terms and measured 
by household income – save less than property 
owners. This lower propensity to save may also 
play a part in explaining the structures that 
were found.
Indeed, the PHF data provide indications that, 
for property owners, redemption payments are 
an important driver of wealth formation. The 
obligation to repay a loan acts as a major in -Possible reason

centive to save. In particular, this is the case 
when households’ redemption payments are 
not made at the expense of other forms of sav -
ings. The aggregate of all savings forms and 
redemption payments less investments liquid -
ated and loans taken up over the past 12 
months reveals that owner households with a 
mortgage – and also owner households with -
out a mortgage – save considerably more than 
tenants. On average, this applies not only to 
the absolute amount of savings but also to the 
savings amounts as a percentage of income. 
Thus, it is possible that tenant households are 
less able and also less willing to save. One 
 explanation for their low propensity to save 
could be that, for many households, the social 
security funds and the public goods and ser -
vices cover, at least in principle, many life risks 
and basic needs (unemployment, retirement, 
illness, long- term care, school and university 
education). This has the effect of weakening or 
even wholly eliminating important traditional 
motives for saving.9 The efficient social security 
system is funded by comparatively high taxes, 
deductions and contributions.10 At household 
level, this system has the same effect as com -
pulsory saving.
Saving behaviour and differences in income do 
not explain everything, however. Even where 
wealth exists, the desire to own real estate is relatively low in Germany. Unlike in many other 
European countries, the large and differenti -
ated market for rented accommodation in Ger -
many makes the need to buy one’s own home 
less urgent. In addition, to rent a home is to 
retain one’s mobility; moreover, renting does 
not burden young households with the inher -
ent risk of largely concentrating on one asset.
The large number of socio- demographic char -
acteristics covered by the PHF also allow a bet -
ter understanding of wealth.11 If a household 
has more than one member, surveys of this 
kind make use of a reference person. In the 
case of the PHF, the household reference per -
son is usually the main earner.12
The PHF does not yet permit a longitudinal 
view. However, an analysis of the age structure 
is informative as it shows a clear life- cycle pat -
tern,13 ie both mean wealth and median wealth 
rise up to the age of 64 years, then decline. 
The wealthiest households are those with a ref -
erence person aged between 55 and 64 years 
(median net wealth: €102,500). By contrast, a 
household with a reference person below 25 
years of age has a median income of only 
€2,400 at its disposal. Different factors explain 
the life- cycle pattern, such as the formation of 
wealth by saving from available income, or in -
heritances and gifts. Moreover, wealth- age cor -Wealth by life

borne in mind that cross- section analysis does not allow a

relations are probably affected by the fact that 
a household’s way of living typically changes 
over its life cycle. Single households, families 
without children and families with children are 
differently represented in the age groups and 
show, in some instances, marked differences in 
the wealth they hold (see the table on page 38).
Furthermore, one would expect education (or 
human capital) to have a major influence on a 
household’s finances. The PHF figures confirm 
this relationship. The reference person’s school 
education is a good indicator of a household’s 
net wealth. Where the household reference 
person has no school qualifications, the me -
dian net wealth stands at €8,500, which is 
roughly one- tenth of the value for high-  
achieving school leavers. Mean net wealth is a 
quarter of the corresponding value for high-  
achieving school leavers. Cohort effects might 
also play a part in this: whereas earlier gener -
ations with no qualifications or with basic 
school education were also able to enter suc -
cessfully into working life, that is very difficult 
today.
As might be expected, the relationship be -
tween current income and wealth in Germany 
is positive on average. Households in the low -
est fifth of gross income distribution hold mean 
net wealth of €42,100, and the 10% of house -
holds with the highest income hold €692,400. 
However, the data also show that these aver -
ages do not give a complete picture of the re -
lationships between wealth and income. For 
example, freelancers often have above- average 
wealth even though they may not have a high 
income, because they make their own provi -
sion for retirement. Pensioners and retired civil 
servants, too, often have a high level of wealth 
measured by their income.
A regional breakdown reveals marked differ -
ences not only between west German and east 
German households but also between regions 
in the west of the country. The wealthiest 
households are to be found in southern Ger -
many (the Federal states of Bavaria, Baden-  Württemberg and Hesse), where mean net 
wealth comes to €252,000 and median net 
wealth to €106,000, or more than double the 
figure for Germany as a whole. Inequality, too, 
is least pronounced in the three southern most 
states (Gini index: 68.3%). The region compris -
ing the Federal states of North Rhine-  
Westphalia, Rhineland- Palatinate and Saarland 
are roughly consistent with the figure for Ger -
many as a whole, while the “northern” region 
(Lower Saxony, Schleswig- Holstein, Hamburg 
and Bremen) at €41,400 and, above all, eastern 
Germany (including Berlin) with median net 
wealth of €21,400 fall short of the overall fig -
ure for Germany. Thus, the median for Ger -
many as a whole is still depressed by the legacy 
of the German Democratic Republic as, before 
reunification, households there had very few 
opportunities or incentives to build up wealth.
Furthermore, the regional structure of house -
holds’ wealth confirms the above arguments: 
thus, incomes are higher than average in the 
south and home ownership is also more wide -
spread.
Components of wealth
In addition to observing gross and net wealth 
as a whole, important information is also to be 
gained from the PHF in that it grants a com -
paratively detailed insight into the structure of 
household wealth and debt. Information on 
portfolio structures can provide, among other 
things, valuable indications of the effects of 
macroeconomic shocks and economic policy 
measures. The transmission of monetary policy, 
which is of particular interest to central banks, 
is also affected by them. For instance, inflation -
ary developments can affect households in dif -
ferent ways, depending on the composition of 
their wealth and debt. The portfolio structure 
can likewise give indications of whether and 
for what reasons some population groups have 
no or insufficient access to certain types of 
assets (eg shares). This can then have an im -
pact on the wealth and risk situation of the Education

households themselves. After all, there is a re -
lationship between potential returns and, 
therefore, the formation of assets over time 
and the investment forms chosen.
Indeed, the composition of wealth often varies 
depending on the size of the households’ 
wealth holdings. This is particularly true in the 
case of real assets, and is at least partly true of 
financial assets.14 In keeping with this picture, 
the importance of these two main categories 
differs markedly depending on the type of 
household. Gross real assets account for al -
most 80% of total assets; however, in an aver -
age household’s portfolio, real and financial 
assets are roughly equally balanced. In other 
words, there is a strong concentration of real 
assets among the richer households. A similar 
picture is presented within the real assets cat -
egory. Almost two- thirds of German house -
holds own a vehicle (71%) but only 44% own 
their own home. Taken together, however, the 
value of these residential properties is ten times higher than the value of the vehicles. Owner -
ship of business wealth is even more concen -
trated. Only 10% of the surveyed households 
reported that they have business assets, and a 
business household in the middle of the distri -
bution owns such assets only to the tune of 
around €20,000. By contrast, the mean value is 
more than €330,000. Inasmuch as these in -
vestment forms generate above- average re -
turns, this itself plays a part in wealth distribu -
tion becoming entrenched. Holdings in com -
panies are also concentrated on a compara -
tively small percentage of wealthy households 
in the euro area as a whole. Only 11% of such 
households own business wealth.High concentra-

14 In the PHF, real assets include real estate, vehicles, valu -

nesses. Financial assets include assets on savings and cur -
rent accounts (including savings under building loan ac -
counts), mutual fund shares, bonds, shares, certificates, 
money claims on other households, private voluntary pen -
sion plans and whole life insurance policies. Debt com -
prises secured and unsecured loans, account overdrafts

Savings and sight deposits are the predominant 
financial asset forms: these are the most wide -
spread assets, accounting for almost half of 
total financial assets (44%). The other half of 
financial assets is made up almost equally of 
securities (23% of total financial assets) and pri -
vate pension plans and whole life insurance 
policies (27% of total financial assets).
Mutual fund shares are the most popular type 
of security among households, with just over 
17% of households investing money in them. 
By contrast, only 11% of households hold direct 
share investments, and 5% of households own 
bonds.15 Thus, a strong concentration is evi -
dent in the case of stocks and bonds, as it is for 
business assets. This means that only a small 
percentage of households are affected to a 
substantial extent by changes in the prices of 
these wealth components.
A breakdown of the portfolios for households 
at different positions in wealth distribution 
shows, moreover, that it is mainly wealthy 
households that own securities. Generally 
speaking, it is with regard to housing wealth 
and the ownership of securities that differences 
between wealthy and non- wealthy households 
are most pronounced. On the other hand, 
wealthy and non- wealthy households are rela -
tively similar in terms of their participation rate 
in subsidised private (Riester and Rürup) retire -
ment pensions. It is interesting to note that, for 
households in the middle of the wealth distri -
bution, the participation rates in traditional in -
vestment forms – ie savings accounts and sav -
ings under building loan contracts – as well as, 
to an extent, in whole life insurance, do not 
differ substantially from those of the very 
wealthy households; however, the invested 
amounts are, of course, different.
Household savings
Wealth and the structure of wealth are largely 
the result of earlier savings, either by the house -
holds themselves or by testators. Savings today are the foundation of future wealth. The PHF is 
the only study of the HFCN project that con -
tains in-  depth questions about savings behav -
iour. The PHF seeks to record the saving behind 
each individual financial asset in order to forge 
a link between the wealth surveys over time. 
These findings together with information on 
the repayment of loans and on private retire -
ment provisioning at the individual level will 
create a comprehensive picture of the savings 
behaviour of German households.
Asked about their general attitude towards sav -
ing, 57% of all households replied that they 
save a part of their income on a regular basis.

ings, the survey reveals that, in fact, more than 
70% of households accumulate savings on a 
regular basis.
According to the life- cycle hypothesis,16 house -
holds do not save as an end in itself but in 
order to keep their consumption as constant as 
possible or to smooth consumption over the 
course of their life, irrespective of the temporal 
distribution of their income. The typical pattern 
that follows from the life- cycle hypothesis, 
namely that people save when young and dis -
save when older, can to an extent also be 
found in the PHF data for Germany.17
Young households still have (in terms of their 
expectations for the future as well) low in -
comes and save less often than older house -
holds. Their propensity to save and their wealth 
rise relatively quickly as their age and income 
increase (see the chart above). Whereas the 
propensity to save declines in the case of 
households whose main earner is between 55 and 64 years of age, wealth continues to in -
crease. This shows that not only savings dy -
namics but also inheritances and gifts are im -
portant factors in household finances.
The hypothesis that consumption smoothing is 
a key reason for accumulating savings in Ger -
many is underpinned by the additional ques -
tions on motives for saving. Across all age cat -
egories, households in Germany report that 
provisioning for emergency situations is their 
main motive for saving. This reason remains of 
particular importance even among older house -
holds which no longer have any income- related 
risks. There are clearer differences over the life 
cycle with regard to other motives for saving. 
In most cases, saving is more or less important 
according to the changing life circumstances of 
the households. Younger households save in 
order to make major purchases, buy real estate 
or support children. In the main income-  
earning years between 35 and 54, retirement 
provisioning increases in importance to be -
come the main reason for saving, whereas 
major purchases and buying real estate de -
crease in importance. Only at retirement age 
do family inheritance considerations arise, al -
though this motive is less important than pre -
cautionary saving or saving to provide for re -
tirement.
However, it is striking that the oldest house -
holds in Germany also continue to save. The 
PHF is not the only study to note this. By con -
trast, the classical life- cycle theory would pos -
tulate that the older households no longer 
save, but instead use up – or dissave – their Savings behav-
iour reveals life- cycle patternProvisioning for

17 When interpreting the life- cycle pattern shown here, 
one must generally bear in mind that the analysis pre -
sented here of saving over the life cycle disregards cohort 
and time effects. Although such effects are important, they 
cannot be considered until the survey has been repeated. 
The pattern that is identified represents a life cycle when it 
is assumed that the 25-year olds today will, in 30 years’ 
time, behave like the 55-year olds today. Events or policy 
decisions which affect only a certain birth cohort, for ex -
ample, are ignored in the charts.Deutsche Bundesbank

wealth. One possible explanation may be that 
uncertainty about their remaining lifetime and 
the associated costs are the predominant mo -
tive for saving in this age category.18
Debt
Data on the wealth situation are supplemented 
by corresponding information on household 
debt. In a number of countries, it was the over -
indebtedness of a substantial number of house -
holds, often combined with the bursting of a 
housing price bubble, which contributed to the 
emergence of financial crises. For this reason, 
too, central banks are interested in learning not 
only about debt as a whole but also about its 
distribution and the type of debt, and in ob -
taining background information on the re -
spective households.
The PHF data do not suggest that German 
household debt poses a serious problem for 
the financial system. Almost one in every two 
households has debt (47%), but as a rule they 
have assets of matching or higher amounts. 
This is borne out by the fact that the major 
debts are for the most part mortgage debt. Nor 
is there any sign that assets of this kind are over -
stated as a result, say, of earlier price bubbles.
Nor do other commonly used indicators of 
household debt point to major problems in this 
respect. Only one- fifth of indebted households 
have to pay interest exceeding 10.5% of their 
gross income. Including principal payments, 
the percentage is still less than 23% of gross 
income and 34% of net income. This picture is 
confirmed when overindebted households, ie 
those with a negative net wealth, are con -
sidered in isolation. These account for a com -
paratively small percentage of households (just 
over 7%) and the level of their debt is manage -
able (mean value: €14,200, median: €4,000). 
Thus, there would only be cause for concern in 
future if housing prices or the income situation 
of (indebted) households were to change dra -
matically.Summary and outlook
This article offers an overview of the results of 
the first wave of the survey of German house -
holds on their finances, which shows wealth to 
be rather small and relatively unevenly distrib -
uted. This is true, first, in relation to income 
(and even more so in relation to consump -
tion) – as is also the case in other economies. 
The fact that wealth is more unevenly distrib -
uted is hardly surprising, bearing in mind that 
wealth is the result of the accumulation of earl -
ier saving decisions. Wealth distribution is also 
fairly uneven compared with the average for 
the euro- area countries. On the other hand, 
the distribution of wealth in Germany is consid -
erably more even than in countries such as the 
United States or Switzerland. The picture for 
Germany is likely to be affected by the fact 
that, given a broad and efficient market for 
rented accommodation, many German house -
holds consider the need to accumulate wealth 
– while setting aside consumption wishes – less German house-
hold debt not a serious problem for the financial systemDistribution of debt serviceas a percentage of net incomefor indebted households

urgent. Moreover, there has been a lack of 
strong financial incentives to purchase residen -
tial property in the past few years. Germany 
may also still be feeling the after- effects of his -
torical events such as the two world wars and 
partition. Basically speaking, the need to accu -
mulate private wealth is weaker, the more 
strongly households can depend on the com -
munity in terms of covering their basic needs 
such as education, health and provisioning in 
old age, sickness and unemployment. More -
over, the results concerning the wealth com -
ponents and the debt situation are of direct 
relevance for monetary policy. The high con -
centration of real assets (particularly of real es -
tate and business ownership) and securities 
that was identified among the rich households 
may have an effect on the workings of monet -
ary policy measures. Household debt does not 
give any cause for concern at present with re -
gard to financial stability. Unlike the situation in 
a number of other countries, overindebtedness 
is not a widespread phenomenon in Germany.
Further detailed analysis will be needed to gain 
a better understanding of the determinants of 
wealth and wealth distribution.19 The second 
wave of the survey, scheduled for 2014, will 
also help in gaining better insight into house -
hold finances and how they develop under the 
influence of various factors.
The tables accompanying 
this article: Overview of the 
tabulated results
Only a small selection of the figures on German 
household finances can be presented in the article on the PHF findings. The following annex 
contains further tables on the aspects men -
tioned. Each table shows the percentage of 
households which own a particular asset or are 
in debt (participation rates), the conditional 
mean value and the conditional median.20 
Where no participation rate is given, it is 100% 
and the mean values and medians refer to all 
households. These three ratios are shown in 
total as well as broken down by the age, na -
tionality, labour market status, education and 
vocational training of the reference person, the 
type of household, the region in which a 
household lives and its homeowner status. 
Moreover, a differentiation is made according 
to a household’s position in the distribution of 
net wealth and gross income.
19 The academic research that is being conducted outside 
the Bundesbank will be a valuable complement to the 
Bank’s own research work in this respect. Since the PHF 
data were released at the end of March, a number of re -
searchers from outside the Bank have applied for access to 
the anonymised scientific use file, and the first projects are 
already under way. The procedure for requesting access to 
the data is explained at www.bundesbank.de/phf- data.
20 The term “conditional” used here means that house -
holds which do not own the asset in question are not in -
cluded in the calculation. An example: the conditional 
mean value for owner- occupied housing wealth comes to 
€205,760 and applies to only the 44% of households with 
owner- occupied housing wealth. On the other hand, the 
56% tenant households are included in the calculation of 
the unconditional mean value with a value of €0. Thus, the 
unconditional mean value is around €90,900.Deutsche Bundesbank

Household finances, saving and inequality: 
an international perspective –  
conference held by the Bundesbank  
and the Max Planck Institute  
for Social Law and Social Policy
Financial and real assets are distributed very differently among households of national economies 
across the globe. There can also be very wide disparities in their composition. Furthermore, there 
are often considerable differences between countries with regard to the distribution and compos -
ition of wealth. With this in mind, the Bundesbank, together with the Max Planck Institute for 
Social Law and Social Policy, organised a conference which was held on 21 and 22 March of this 
year. This article summarises the most important findings of that conference.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
June 2013  
51

One purpose of the conference was to present 
the initial findings from surveys of households 
in Germany and other euro- area countries 
yielding information on their financial circum -
stances. Additionally, the conference was to 
 investigate a series of questions that can be 
 answered using relevant data.1 Among the 
most important issues to which an answer was 
being sought at the conference were
– What determines the composition of house -
hold wealth?
– How do households prepare for retirement 
in terms of their asset decisions?
– What determines the acquisition of prop -
erty, which typically accounts for a very sig -
nificant part of household wealth?
Two lectures, by Professor Michael Hurd of 
the RAND Corporation and Professor Michael 
Haliassos of the University of Frankfurt, add -
itionally dealt with issues which have found 
particular interest in connection with the latest 
financial and economic crisis.
– How did households’ stock and housing 
wealth losses in the “Great Recession” in the 
United States affect their spending behav -
iour?
and
– Do we need to take special precautions to 
keep households out of financial trouble 
and, if so, what form should such measures 
take?
Information on the initial findings of the Panel 
on Household Finances (PHF) has been pro -
vided by the preceding article on “Household 
wealth and finances in Germany – results of 
the Bundesbank study” (see pages 23 to 49). 
A paper analysing the composition of German 
households’ wealth was also presented at the 
conference. In particular, the paper investi -
gated the question of whether there are signs that households have selected their assets sub -
optimally with regard to return expectations 
and risk. In actual fact, there are indications 
that improvements are possible for some cat -
egories of households.
Alongside initial findings from the German 
panel, an account was given of impressions 
gained from the results of European surveys 
collected in parallel with the German data. 
Firstly, the results for the euro- area countries 
were compared with those for the United 
States. Secondly, initial attempts were made to 
explain the differences among the countries of 
the euro area. In Europe and the USA, wealth is 
distributed noticeably more unevenly than in -
come. With regard to both variables, however, 
Europe is characterised by significantly greater 
homogeneity than the United States. Marked 
differences can also be observed in terms of 
borrowing: US households are more heavily in 
debt than households in Europe. Differences in 
wealth in Europe can largely be explained by 
three factors: very wide variations in levels of 
home ownership (with a comparatively small 
number of households living in their own 
homes in Germany and Austria, while home 
ownership is much more widespread in Spain 
and the Slovak Republic). Developments in 
house prices have differed considerably over 
the past few years. Finally, the importance of 
intergenerational transfers is not everywhere of 
equal relevance.
Along with the size and distribution of wealth, 
its composition is of major importance. This 
can give us indications of whether different 
categories of households are restricted, say, in 
their investment decisions, what their invest -
ment motives are, or how changes in the 
underlying conditions – such as general infla -
tion or price changes in certain markets (such 
as the housing market or stock market) – affect 
households. Several papers at the conference Micro datasets

examined how the portfolio of financial wealth 
changes over the life cycle and what deter -
mines that change. In general, the results are in 
line with expectations: with age (or with de -
clining life expectation), investment in stocks 
initially increases before falling again upon 
reaching retirement age. Conversely, fixed-  
interest assets then become more important.
These observations are consistent with the no -
tion that retirement provision is a key motive 
for accumulating assets. Unfortunately, the 
available information on financial entitlements 
after retirement is still imprecise. This applies, in 
particular, to occupational pensions, which are 
becoming increasingly important. At the con -
ference, an account was also given of the initial 
stages of a project being conducted by the 
Max Planck Institute for Social Law and Social 
Policy together with the Institute for Employ -
ment Research, the Research Institute of the 
German Federal Employment Agency, which is 
aimed at a better reporting and understanding 
of occupational pensions in Germany. Two 
other presentations discussed related topics: 
“Can the Dutch meet their own retirement ex -
penditure goals” and, relating to households in 
Norway, “Heterogeneity in the offset effect of 
the pension wealth on other private wealth”. In 
both cases, it was stressed that there is a con -
siderable degree of heterogeneity. For example, 
wealthy households evidently substitute more 
heavily between private saving and pension en -
titlements than poor households. This reveals 
that talking about averages is, in many cases, 
of limited information value.
Possessing or seeking to possess property is a 
particularly important wealth decision. Under -
standing this decision is therefore of great 
interest. A study for Sweden showed, for ex -
ample, that households attach major import -
ance to their own employment situation when 
buying a home. These data can be used to 
identify, among other things, how potential 
risks of becoming unemployed influence the 
decision to buy a home.The sharp losses in stocks and housing wealth 
during the recent crisis in the United States 
were taken by Michael Hurd as a basis for 
asking how the affected households changed 
their consumption expenditure in the after -
math. Among other things, it is important that 
such studies distinguish between households at 
different stages of life, since older persons, for 
example, not only possess more assets, but 
also, given a different life perspective, perhaps 
make different decisions. Overall, the US data 
point to marked reactions in consumption to 
the losses in stock and housing wealth, al -
though the reaction to house prices was obvi -
ously stronger.
In a further presentation, Michael Haliassos 
gave an overview of possible precautionary 
measures designed to protect households from 
serious financial problems. In view of the asso -
ciated costs, it initially appears obvious that 
such measures make sense. On the other hand, 
it is apparent that many of the proposed ap -
proaches may not produce the intended result. 
The proposal that households have to be kept 
away from certain investment instruments (or, 
conversely, that some investments should be 
especially recommended to households) seems 
to raise problems given that identical invest -
ments may be prudent for some households 
but not so for others. Nor is recommending 
better information and education for house -
holds in financial matters necessarily without 
problems: it can be seen that such measures 
may lead to households becoming overconfi -
dent and developing too great a risk appetite.
Overall, the conference showed that data on 
household wealth can supply a great many in -
sights that can be used to gain a better impres -
sion of the state of an economy. This can then 
be the starting point for a better assessment of 
the impact of economic policy measures and 
underlying institutional conditions.Wealthy house-

Implementing Basel III  
in European and national law
The G20 leaders’ direct response to the financial crisis was to adopt an action plan aimed at 
strengthening the resilience of the financial sector, and thus reinforcing financial stability, as well 
as eliminating the weaknesses which had become apparent during the crisis, particularly in finan -
cial market regulation and international cooperation.
A core element of this package of measures, referred to collectively as the Basel III framework, is 
a fundamental improvement in institutions’ capital and liquidity, thereby fulfilling one of the main 
aims of the G20 action plan. The banks are required to hold not just higher- quantity but also 
higher- quality minimum capital reserves, which will also distinctly improve their loss absorbency. 
Further risks can also be absorbed by means of additional capital buffers which are much more 
flexible than minimum ratios and through which, for the first time, macroprudential or systemic 
aspects can also be taken into account in capital regimes. The liquidity rules, which have been 
established internationally for the first time, represent a further major step towards ensuring that 
institutions have sufficient liquidity at all times using regulatory means, thereby making the finan -
cial sector more crisis- resistant. The strict standards, which build on experience gained during the 
financial crisis, will replace a patchwork of regimes in Europe and help create a more level play -
ing field in the internal market.
The Basel III framework will be implemented in Europe by the CRD IV package, consisting of a 
regulation which is directly applicable legislation and a directive which needs to be transposed 
into national law. This article gives an overview of the interplay and the content of the implemen -
tation of Basel III in the EU and the national legal systems. Whereas, for instance, the rules gov -
erning minimum capital adequacy and limiting institutions’ liquidity risk are largely set by the EU 
regulation and therefore do not have to be transposed into national law, the capital buffer 
requirements, for instance, are governed by the EU directive, and therefore require national trans -
position. Owing to this implementation requirement and the direct applicability of the EU regula -
tion, in Germany the German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz) and the associated national regu -
lations are being adapted.
These measures represent, on the whole, a key step towards sustainably strengthening the resili -
ence of the banking system. These extremely tightened rules, however, must be implemented in a 
balanced manner so as not to have any undesired effects on lending. The CRD IV package and 
the associated national legal frameworks provide for sufficient transitional periods for implemen -
tation by institutions.Deutsche Bundesbank

Implementing Basel III  
in the European Union
The European Union (EU) will implement the 
Basel standards1 in European law in two differ -
ent legislative acts: the Capital Requirements 
Directive IV (CRD IV)2 and the Capital Require -
ments Regulation (CRR).3 Following the inten -
sive trilogue negotiations between the Council, 
Parliament and Commission, agreement on the 
texts of CRD IV and CRR was reached in Febru -
ary 2013. The EU therefore failed to meet the 
deadline agreed by the G20 countries for the 
entry into force of the first stage of Basel III – 
1 January 2013. CRR and CRD IV will therefore 
be applicable from 1 January 2014, provided 
the texts are published in the Official Journal of 
the EU on schedule, ie prior to 30 June 2013.
The one- year delay in the introduction of CRR, 
however, will not affect the timetable up until 
the full application of the rules. Instead, the 
Basel Committee agreed to shorten the transi -
tional period for those countries that had not 
introduced the new regime by 1 January 2013.4
The vast majority of the Basel rules mentioned 
at the beginning, but also the large exposures 
regulations and disclosure requirements, for in -
stance, are now governed by the CRR, which, 
as a regulation, represents directly applicable 
law. Transposition into national legislation is 
therefore not only unnecessary, but also pro -
hibited. The whole purpose behind the regula -
tion as a legislative instrument is to significantly 
reduce the discretionary scope currently af -
forded by the directive and prevent differences 
in national rules from creating competitive dis -
tortions. This serves the objective of increased 
harmonisation by means of uniform rules in the 
internal market (single rulebook).
However, the CRR still contains national discre -
tionary scope, national options or provisions 
that need to be fleshed out. One of these is the 
option of exempting CRR investment firms5 
from the liquidity requirements. Moreover, 
there are supplemental rules governing the ap -proval and examination of the internal approaches 
for calculating own funds requirements, the 
transitional regulations for calculating capital 
and options not to count certain exposures to -
wards the large exposures limit. In addition, the 
CRR and CRD IV both offer a degree of flexibil -
ity with regard to the use of macroprudential 
instruments (flexibility package). There is a na -
tional option to tighten various prudential re -
quirements temporarily (see page 63f). In add -
ition, CRD IV provides for a capital buffer for 
systemic risk which can generally be used flex -
ibly by member states (see page 65f).
The directive has retained those rules and pro -
visions which can be dealt with better by na -
tional authorities owing to factors specific to 
individual countries, such as the structure of 
the banking system, the legal and administra -
tive system and the business cycle. This largely 
concerns rules for approving and supervising 
institutions, cross- border cooperation between 
supervisory authorities, additional capital buf -
fers, internal governance (eg remuneration), 
the supervisory review and evaluation process 
and supervisory sanctions.
In order to ensure a uniform set of rules valid 
across national borders (single rulebook), the 
European Banking Authority (EBA) will develop 
draft technical implementation and regulatory 
standards6 in areas which have been expressly EU implementa-
tion through CRR and CRD IV

defined in advance. If these standards are 
adopted by the European Commission by way 
of a regulation or decision, they become dir -
ectly applicable law. Since the deadlines for the 
EBA to develop draft standards mandated by 
CRD IV and CRR are, in some cases, very short, 
the EBA already started work last year. More -
over, the EBA was given the power, or in some 
cases the task, of developing guidelines and 
recommendations for the harmonisation of 
supervisory practice. The Bundesbank and the 
Federal Financial Supervisory Authority ( Bun-
desanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht,  or 
BaFin) are jointly involved in the EBA’s work.
This article will continue by initially explaining 
the CRR’s provisions; the section on “Key 
amendments to the German Banking Act” will 
discuss the new provisions of CRD IV which 
have to be implemented nationally.
Improving the quantity and 
quality of regulatory capital
One of the core elements of the Basel III pack -
age implemented by the CRR is a revision of 
the definition of regulatory capital. The aim is 
to improve both the quality and quantity of 
banks’ capital. This is to be achieved through 
more stringent uniform criteria for recognising 
regulatory capital components, stricter and 
harmonised rules for deductions applied in the 
calculation of the capital base and expanded 
disclosure requirements for banks.
In future, supervisors will be paying increasing 
attention to institutions’ common equity tier 1 
capital, which is composed of paid- in capital 
instruments and disclosed reserves. Both com -
ponents must be available to institutions for 
unrestricted and immediate use to cover risks 
or losses. In order to do justice to the heteroge -
neous nature of the EU banking market, the 
“substance over form” approach contained in 
current European directives will be carried over 
to cover the eligibility of the capital instruments 
contained in common equity tier 1 capital. This means that any instrument which meets the 13 
conditions for recognition intended to model 
the characteristics of the common equity of a 
public limited company and contained in the 
catalogue envisaged by the CRR can be counted 
as common equity tier 1 capital. For listed pub -
lic limited institutions, however, in keeping with 
the Basel III provisions, the recital in the CRR 
contains the expectation that their common 
equity tier 1 capital shall consist exclusively of 
equity capital and disclosed reserves. Excep -
tions that are also contained in Basel III take 
into account the legal restrictions in force in 
the cooperative and savings banks sectors. 
These institutions are permitted, within clear 
confines, to depart from the general conditions 
for recognising common equity tier 1 capital in -
struments.
Only additional tier 1 capital and tier 2 capital 
will be recognised as classes of regulatory cap -
ital alongside common equity tier 1 capital; this 
greatly simplifies the capital structure. Like 
common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 
capital should be continuously available for loss 
absorbency purposes, thereby enabling the 
bank to continue on a going- concern basis. 
Some of the key requirements that instruments 
in this capital class must meet are that they be 
subordinated, that they be perpetual, and that 
distributions be fully discretionary. In addition, 
for additional tier 1 capital institutions have to 
make it possible for the instruments to be con -
verted to common equity tier 1 capital or to be 
depreciated once the common equity tier  1 
capital ratio falls below a threshold of 5.125%.7 
The CRR does not permit incentives to redeem 
capital instruments.8

nificantly and its function is limited to credit New definition

7 This value is the result of a minimum common equity 
tier 1 capital requirement of 4.5% plus the capital conser -
vation buffer threshold of 0.625% (2.5% × 0.25) up to 
which distributions are prohibited altogether.
8 One example is a clause allowing the interest rate to in -
crease if the institution does not exercise a call; this is cur -
rently legal for what are known as innovative capital instru -
ments.Deutsche Bundesbank

protection in the event of a bankruptcy. Tier 2 
capital instruments must have a minimum ori -
ginal maturity of at least five years and must be 
subordinated with respect to repayment if the 
institution goes bankrupt. In this capital class, 
too, incentives to redeem are no longer permit -
ted. Repayment of principal by the institution is 
generally permitted only with the prior consent 
of supervisors; the redemption of maturing 
tier 2 capital components is the only exception 
permitted. The tier 3 funds currently eligible to 
cover market risk are eliminated entirely in the 
new capital structure.
The new rules governing capital deductions are 
also focused on improving the quality of regu -
latory capital and calculating it in a consistent 
manner. The principle behind these provisions 
is that a capital deduction for a position should 
always be taken from that capital class which 
was originally increased by the position. This is 
shown in the table above.Minority interest arising from common shares 
in subsidiaries and other capital instruments is -
sued by consolidated subsidiaries and held by 
third parties may no longer be fully recognised 
towards capital at group level under the CRR 
but only to the extent used by the subsidiary to 
cover the minimum capital requirements, in -
cluding capital buffers. This addresses the fact 
that, in a crisis, minority interest is not fully 
available to the other enterprises in the group. 
Capital issued out of special- purpose vehicles is 
generally recognised only as additional tier 1 
capital or tier 2 capital.
In addition to the expanded and tightened 
rules for deductions, the calibration of future 
capital requirements will lead to a significant 
increase in, above all, institutions’ common 
equity tier 1 capital. The ratio will rise from its 
current level of at least 2% of risk- weighted 
assets to 4.5%. Banks will also have to hold at 
least 1.5% in additional tier 1 capital in future.

it will only be able to contribute 2% (as op -
posed to 4% at present) to covering the total 
capital requirement (8%).
The new minimum capital requirements will 
not be introduced all at once but instead 
phased in by way of transitional regulations so 
that ample time to make the required adjust -
ments is provided. As the new capital is being 
built up, old capital instruments which do not 
meet the new requirements for recognition will 
be phased out, also over a relatively long tran -
sitional period. Starting with the entry into 
force of the CRR, capital instruments issued 
prior to 31  December 2011 will be grandfa -
thered; the eligibility of the total volume of in -
struments existing as at 31 December 2012 will 
be gradually phased out in a process lasting 
until 31 December 2021. The deductions de -
scribed above will likewise be phased in from 
2014 to 2018. The same transitional period will 
be in force for the application of the new rules 
governing minority interest in subsidiaries. Fi -
nally, under the transitional provisions, the gov -
ernment support provided to ensure institu -
tions’ viability on a going- concern basis owing 
to the financial crisis will remain completely eli -
gible as capital components until 31 December 
2017.Change in the capital 
charges for counterparty 
credit risk
During the financial crisis, it turned out that 
much of banks’ losses from derivatives trading 
were caused not by the default of a counter -
party but by mark- to- market losses resulting 
from a deterioration in the counterparty’s 
creditworthiness. The Basel  III package there -
fore introduced a new capital requirement to 
cover such losses: credit valuation adjustments 
(CVA). Under Basel III, this capital requirement 
is valid for all derivatives which are not settled 
via a central counterparty (CCP).
Although this rule is implemented by the CRR, 
extensive exemptions have also been defined: 
under certain conditions, transactions with 
non- financial counterparties can be exempted 
from this new capital requirement. There are 
also exceptions for certain intra- group transac -
tions and derivatives business with pension 
funds, central banks, sovereigns and certain 
public sector entities.
Basel III has not only raised the capital require -
ment for bilaterally settled derivatives contracts 
but has also imposed a mandatory capital 
charge on derivatives contracts settled through 
a CCP . To date, such transactions had been ex -New rules to be

Transitional provisions for capital ratios and capital buffers, deductions and components 
of capital
1 G-SIIs = global systemically important institutions; O-SIIs = other systemically important institutions. Where an institution is subject to 
more than one of these buffers, only the highest of these buffers shall be applied. However, if the systemic risk buffer is applied only to 
risk exposures located in the member state that sets the buffer, this requirement shall be additive to any capital buffer that may be ap-
plicable to G-SIIs or O-SIIs. 2 Example: in 2016, 60% of a deductible exposure must be deducted from capital. The remaining 40% is 
treated in accordance with the deduction rules currently in force. 3 Grandfathered eligible components of capital as a percentage of 
the components of capital that are eligible exclusively under the old rules. Valid for instruments issued prior to 31 December 2011 and/or existing components of capital. Does not include government aid if such aid was provided as part of approved support meas-ures and prior to the entry into force of the CRR. These components of capital are fully eligible up to 31 December 2017 but no longer 
eligible from 1 January 2018 onwards.

empted under certain conditions. In future, 
there will be a capital charge on these transac -
tions, albeit a small one. In July 2012, the Basel 
Committee published a transitional arrange -
ment for treating exposures to CCPs which, in 
its current form, will be incorporated into the 
CRR in its entirety. These rules are currently 
being reworked with the objective of complet -
ing a final proposal regarding such exposures 
by the end of 2013. This proposal is likely to be 
incorporated into the CRR as well.
Introducing quantitative 
 requirements for institutions’ 
liquidity
Minimum liquidity standards serve to strengthen 
institutions’ ability to pay at all times. The 
Basel III framework requires not only a min -
imum amount of specific highly liquid assets as 
a short- term liquidity reserve but also a bal -
anced ratio between the maturity structures of 
banks’ assets and liabilities. This is intended to 
both strengthen banks’ short- term resilience to 
liquidity shocks and create an incentive to avoid 
excessive maturity transformation. In introdu -
cing quantitative liquidity standards, global and 
European standard setters have entered un -
charted regulatory waters. Directive 2006/ 48/
EC contains barely any minimum or reporting 
requirements for institutions’ liquidity reserves 
and funding structures. Another way in which 
the traditional special status of liquidity risk in 
banking supervision is expressed is that, under 
Article 41 of Directive 2006/ 48/EC, the moni -
toring of liquidity risk at foreign branches has 
been exempted from the principle of home 
country control.
The Basel Committee only published its revised 
framework on the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) 
and the monitoring tools in January 2013.9 The 
process of revising and reviewing the net stable 
funding ratio (NSFR) will probably continue 
until mid-2016. European lawmakers took 
these delays into account when implementing 
these ratios in the CRR. The ultimate design of the LCR, which is called liquidity coverage re -
quirement in the CRR, will be defined by the 
Commission through delegated legislation by 
no later than 30 June 2014, and the LCR will be 
phased in as a mandatory minimum standard 
between 2015 and 2018.10 With regard to the 
NSFR, the European Commission will decide by 
the end of 2016 whether, and how, it will be 
introduced. In order to specify the monitoring 
tools, the EBA will present a draft technical im -
plementation standard to the European Com -
mission by 1 January 2014.
In keeping with the international agreements, 
the regulation of liquidity risk will be funda -
mentally rewritten at the EU level with the 
introduction of minimum standards and moni -
toring metrics in Part Six of the CRR. The LCR 
will be a core element in future: institutions will 
have to hold a minimum amount of high-  
quality liquid assets sufficient to offset net cash 
flows over a 30-day horizon under a severe 
stress scenario. On the basis of the nearness to 
liquidity of the assets and certain off- balance 
sheet items, the NSFR identifies a bank’s need 
for stable funding and the financing instru -
ments available to cover this requirement. A 
series of additional monitoring metrics, notably 
including an extensive gap analysis, are also in -
tended to enable the responsible supervisory 
authorities to gain a comprehensive insight into 
institutions’ liquidity profiles.
The CRR varies in some places from the Basel 
liquidity rules and also contains some add -
itional elements. Whereas the Basel framework 
primarily addresses the group level of inter -
nationally active banks, CRR compliance is 
mandatory for all institutions which conduct Minimum quan-
titative require-ments: a first in the international regulatory framework

How the CRR 
differs from the

framework
9 The adequacy of the recognition of central bank funding 
in the LCR will be reviewed once again in 2013 by a high- 
ranking Basel Committee project group. In addition, the 
disclosure rules for the LCR and the market indicators for 
high- quality liquid assets need to be specified by the begin -
ning of 2014.
10 The implementation plan provides for a minimum LCR 
of 60% from 2015, to be increased annually in stages 
to 100% by 2018. Under the delegated legislation on the 
LCR, the European Commission can postpone full introduc -
tion until 2019.Deutsche Bundesbank

deposit and lending business, as well as CRR 
investment firms11 on both a single- entity and 
consolidated basis.12 However, if the liquidity 
management of the consolidated group meets 
certain conditions, the competent authorities 
may, pursuant to Article 8 of the CRR, waive 
application on a single- entity basis in favour of 
higher levels of consolidation (also called the 
liquidity waiver).13 The CRR can differ further 
from Basel III with regard to the definition of 
liquid assets during the transitional period, 
pending a final decision by the European Com -
mission.14 This addresses those special charac -
teristics of the EU member states’ economic 
and financial market structures which are of 
relevance to institutions’ liquidity risk.
Limiting institutions’ debt 
through the leverage ratio
An additional material element of the Basel III 
package and its implementation in the EU is 
the introduction of a leverage ratio, which is a 
bank’s tier 1 capital over total exposure. The 
balance sheet valuations are oriented to the 
relevant accounting standard applicable to that 
particular institution. In order to make the le -
verage ratio internationally comparable, some 
special arrangements have been provided for, 
such as with regard to the rules for netting se -
curities repurchase agreements and derivatives 
or off- balance sheet transactions.
Unlike the risk- based capital requirements, 
which are based on model assumptions, in the 
leverage ratio the individual exposures are not 
risk- weighted but instead included in the met -
ric value unweighted. The leverage ratio is de -
signed to address regulatory weaknesses which 
were revealed during the crisis. Not only should 
the leverage ratio counteract the fundamen -
tally cyclical effect of risk- based capital require -
ments (known as a backstop function) but, as a 
risk- insensitive instrument, offset the defects of 
risk- based capital requirements. Such flaws 
were exposed in the crisis when banks’ losses, 
in some cases, significantly exceeded the risks calculated with the aid of models. The leverage 
ratio’s insensitivity to risk, however, comes with 
its own hazards, as it gives banks an incentive 
to make higher- risk loans and investments.
All institutions will be required, from 2015, to 
disclose their leverage ratio and its components 
using a standardised template. In keeping with 
Basel III, supervisors will initially not set a bind -
ing minimum requirement. During an observa -
tion period lasting until January 2017, super -
visors will track the new ratio in order to ana -
lyse its impact more closely. This may well lead 
to changes in the CRR methodology for calcu -
lating the leverage ratio, especially as some de -
tails regarding the design are still being dis -
cussed by the Basel Committee and need to be 
clarified through consultation with the banking 
industry. In addition, the interplay between the 
leverage ratio and risk- based capital require -
ments, especially for particularly low- risk busi -
ness models, requires further analysis. Lastly, 
the leverage ratio should not impair the posi -
tive incentive effects of risk- based capital re -
quirements. This observation period will be fol -
lowed by a decision on whether to set a bind -
ing minimum value for the leverage ratio at the 
European level and, if so, how high that level 
should be.
Systemic risk
One of the essential lessons from the financial 
crisis was to interweave microprudential and Leverage ratio 
being intro-duced as an additional  metric alongside risk- based cap-ital requirementsInterplay  between lever-age ratio and risk- based cap-
ital requirements 
should initially 
be analysed
11 Until the European Commission issues a report by not 
later than 31 December 2014, the competent authorities 
are permitted to exempt investment firms from the require -
ments (only reporting requirements up to then) pursuant to 
Part Six of the CRR. This option is exercised in section 2 of 
the Banking Act.
12 Liquidity- specific exemptions for groups or institutions 
belonging to a group can generally also be applied to net -
work member institutions.
13 The CRR alternatively gives the competent supervisory 
authorities the option of making individual inflow or out -
flow assumptions for certain intra- group cash flows.
14 With regard to cash flow assumptions, the CRR envis -
ages rules deviating from Basel III for promotional loans, 
open maturity loans, corporate deposits as part of trad -
itional relationship banking, and in exceptions, limits on 
inflows.Deutsche Bundesbank

macroprudential oversight more tightly and, 
accordingly, to establish macroprudential insti -
tutions and create macroprudential instru -
ments.15 It is for this reason that the flexibility 
package mentioned on page 56 was inserted 
into the CRR and CRD IV.16 In order to address 
systemic risk at the national level, the member 
states will, in future, be able to impose stricter 
regulatory measures to tighten the require -
ments for own funds, large exposures, disclos -
ure or the like (Article 458 of the CRR). Any 
member state wishing to impose such a meas -
ure has to inform the European Parliament, the 
European Commission, the Council, the ESRB 
and the EBA and submit justification. Upon a 
proposal by the Commission, the Council may 
reject the measure under certain conditions by 
a qualified majority. However, the following 
temporary measures may be imposed by any 
member state – and may not be rejected by the 
Council: an increase in the risk weights for resi -
dential and commercial real estate loans and 
for intra- financial sector exposures by up 
to 25 percentage points, and a reduction of up 
to 15 percentage points in the upper limit for 
large exposures.
In the case of systemic risk which affects all 
member states, the European Commission is 
empowered to impose stricter prudential re -
quirements in some areas (level of own funds, 
large exposures and disclosure) for a period of 
one year (Article 459 of the CRR).
Capital relief for exposures 
to small and medium- sized 
enterprises
The CRR introduces a reduction in the capital 
charges for exposures to small and medium-  
sized enterprises (SMEs). In future, the capital 
requirements for such exposures shall be multi -
plied by a supporting factor equal to 0.7619.17 
This is intended to neutralise the increase in the 
minimum own funds requirement resulting 
from the phase- in of the capital conservation 
buffer (see page 65); in other words, after the phase- in of the capital conservation buffer, in -
stitutions will be required to hold the same 
amount of capital as before.
This rule applies to all exposures to SMEs with 
up to €50 million in annual turnover, irrespect -
ive of the exposure class to which borrowers 
are assigned. It is also predicated on the total 
sum of a given credit institution’s exposures to 
an SME not exceeding €1.5 million.
Within three years after the entry into force of 
the CRR, the European Commission, supported 
by the EBA, shall report on the impact of this 
new provision on lending to SMEs and analyse 
the default risk inherent in such exposures 
across this period of time.
Key amendments to the 
 German Banking Act
The stricter European regime introduced by 
CRD IV and the new harmonised European 
banking supervisory legislation built around a 
directly applicable EU regulation have necessi -
tated fundamental amendments to the existing 
national legislation; in Germany, changes will 
need to be made to the Banking Act (Kredit -
wesengesetz) . This will be done by means of 
the CRD IV Implementation Act (CRD IV-  
Umsetzungsgesetz),  which not only imple -
ments CRD IV in German law but also repeals 
national provisions on matters which will be 
directly governed by the CRR in future or con -
tradict the new legislation. For instance, the 
CRR mostly contains provisions specifying insti -
tutions’ capital adequacy, which is why the def -
inition of own funds currently set forth in sec -
tion 10 of the Banking Act will be repealed and 
the provision will be essentially reduced to the Tightening of

authority to issue a regulation regarding solv -
ency rules – which still need to be fleshed out 
at the national level – as well as rules govern -
ing the imposition of stricter capital adequacy 
requirements by BaFin. Furthermore, the imple -
menting legislation exercises the few remaining 
national options in the CRR and specifies the 
existing scope for discretion. The date on which 
the amendments to the Banking Act come into 
effect will depend on the date of application of 
the CRR.
The EU directive requires member states to des -
ignate the competent authority responsible for 
performing the tasks and functions set forth in 
CRD IV and inform the European Commission 
and the EBA thereof. CRD  IV expressly makes 
special allowances for cases such as Germany 
with two competent authorities. In fulfilling its 
statutory mandate to monitor institutions on 
an ongoing basis, the Bundesbank performs 
activities assigned to a competent authority 
and will therefore be designated as a compe -
tent authority alongside BaFin in section 6 of 
the Banking Act.
Greater prominence is given to the provisions 
governing the supervisory review and evalu -
ation process (SREP), which are significant in 
terms of preventive supervision, by explicitly 
anchoring them in a new section 6b of the Banking Act. In this respect, BaFin is to work 
closely with the Bundesbank to reach a sum -
mary, forward- looking assessment on whether 
the rules, strategies, procedures and processes 
implemented by a given institution are compli -
ant with the supervisory requirement to ensure 
appropriate and effective risk management and 
sound risk coverage. Their assessment takes ac -
count of factors such as the outcome of stress 
tests and the risks that an institution poses to 
the financial system.
The definition of credit institutions in the CRR is 
confined to enterprises that conduct deposit 
and lending business, while the Banking Act 
term is broader in scope. Likewise, the defin -
ition of financial services institutions in the 
Banking Act is wider than that of investment 
firms in the CRR. Germany has no plans to 
amend its broad national definition of the term 
“institution”, which it used to successfully con -
tain the unregulated shadow banking sector; 
hence, the corresponding terminology used in 
the Banking Act will remain unchanged. Sec -
tion 1a of the Banking Act envisages that all 
enterprises falling within the broad scope of 
the term “institution” pursuant to the Banking 
Act will have to comply with the CRR.
Although section 1a of the Banking Act ex -
tends the reach of the CRR, a number of excep -
tions will be permitted. Owing to their business 
model, guarantee banks will not need to com -
ply with the rules governing liquidity adequacy, 
the leverage ratio and the countercyclical cap -
ital buffer. Moreover, the CRR regime will not 
be applicable to housing enterprises with sav -
ings facilities. These enterprises, which receive 
deposits on a small scale, will be subject to spe -
cial rules that are closely aligned with their 
business structure and take account of the fact 
that they only conduct banking business on a 
very limited scale. In addition, exceptions will 
continue to be made for certain financial ser -
vices institutions.

fer18 and the countercyclical capital buffer19 – 
as well as the global systemically important in -
stitution (G-  SII) buffer20 and the other systemic -
ally important institution (O-  SII) buffer21 based 
on the Basel frameworks22 governing global 
and domestic systemically important banks, the 
European trilogue negotiations also agreed to 
incorporate the systemic risk buffer23 into 
CRD IV.
Unlike the fixed capital conservation buffer, 
which is set at a uniform rate of 2.5% for all 
institutions, each institution is required to cal -
culate and apply its own institution- specific 
countercyclical buffer rate. The idea behind the 
countercyclical buffer is to enable institutions 
to build up additional capital in times when ex -
cessive credit growth is judged to be associated 
with the emergence of systemic risk. To take 
account of the setting in which institutions op -
erate, the buffer rate is set according to the 
jurisdiction in which the exposure is located. In -
stitutions with domestic exposures must calcu -
late their buffer rate using a rate set by BaFin 
for Germany, while the buffer rate for foreign 
exposures is generally based on the rate applic -
able there. Reciprocity is mandatory within the 
EU for buffer rates of up to 2.5%; in other 
words, the buffer rates set by other member 
states must be accepted as given. Buffer rates 
set by other member states in excess of 2.5% 
are to be respected by domestic institutions, 
provided that BaFin recognises these rates. The 
same goes for buffer rates set by third coun -
tries. If a third country has not set a buffer rate 
for exposures in that country, BaFin may do so; 
additionally, it may require domestic institu -
tions to apply a buffer rate to exposures lo -
cated in a third country that is higher than the 
buffer rate set by that country if it deems such 
action necessary to shield domestic institutions 
against the risks of excessive credit growth in 
that third country.
The capital conservation buffer and the coun -
tercyclical buffer will phased in from 2016 in 
four equal steps, and the full rate will only be 
applicable from 2019 onwards.The systemic risk buffer gives member states 
the ability to address long- term, non- cyclical 
systemic or macroprudential risk at a national 
level. The use of this buffer is predicated on the 
risk in question potentially having serious nega -
tive consequences for the national financial 
system and the real economy and not already 
having been adequately mitigated or prevented 
by other measures included in the CRD IV pack -
age. The imposition of the systemic risk buffer 
may not entail disproportionate adverse effects 
on the whole or parts of the financial system of 
other member states or of the EU as a whole; 
ie it should not create an obstacle to the func -
tioning of the internal market.
The systemic risk buffer amounts to at least 1% 
and can be deployed flexibly. It can, for in -
stance, be set for all institutions, one or more 
subsets of institutions, and for exposures lo -
cated in the domestic market, in other member 
states or in third countries, and different re -
quirements can also be set for different sub -
sets. However, depending on the amount and 
location of the exposures to be covered by the 
systemic risk buffer, a number of different pro -
cedures need to be followed before a national 
authority is allowed to apply this buffer. In any 
event, the authority is required to notify and 
justify the planned measure to the European 
Commission, the EBA, the ESRB and the foreign 
authorities affected. For buffer rates of up 
to 3%, notification will suffice for the impos -
ition of the buffer.24 Buffer rates above that Capital conser-

level are subject to complex procedures involv -
ing the European Commission, the ESRB and 
the EBA. Much like the countercyclical capital 
buffer, the systemic risk buffer also gives na -
tional authorities the option of recognising buf -
fer rates set in other member states. Domestic 
institutions with exposures in other member 
states would then have to apply the same sys -
temic risk buffers set in the countries in ques -
tion.
As from 2016, G-  SIIs will be required to main -
tain, on a consolidated basis, an additional sys -
temic risk buffer which, depending on the sys -
temic importance of the group in question, is 
between 1% and 3.5%. G-  SIIs are identified 
annually using an internationally agreed meth -
odology which takes account of the following 
criteria: size, interconnectedness with the fi -
nancial system, substitutability, complexity and 
cross- border activities.National supervisory authorities likewise have 
the option of imposing an additional capital 
buffer of up to 2% on O-  SIIs as from 2016. The 
criteria used for identifying O-  SIIs each year are 
similar to those for G-  SIIs but offer authorities a 
little more leeway. A national authority wishing 
to impose a capital buffer on O-  SIIs must notify 
and justify the planned measure to the Euro -
pean Commission, the EBA and the ESRB as 
well as to the competent authorities of any 
member states affected.
The G-  SII and O-  SII capital buffers are not gen -
erally intended to be additive because they are 
designed to cover the same risk. Bearing this in 
mind, an institution that is subject to both a 
G- SII and an O-  SII capital buffer needs only to 
apply the higher of the two buffers. An institu -
tion that is subject to a G-  SII or an O-  SII capital 
buffer as well as a systemic risk buffer likewise 
needs only to apply the higher buffer unless

3 May be higher; cross-border reciprocity is generally mandatory up to a buffer rate of 2.5%. 4 As a percentage of the risk-weighted 
exposure values of those risk exposures in respect of which the systemic risk buffer is imposed. The procedures for imposing the buffer 
vary depending on the amount and location of the risk exposures to which the buffer is applicable. 5 If an O-SII is the subsidiary either 
of a G-SII or an O-SII domiciled abroad that is subject to an O-SII capital buffer on a consolidated basis, the capital buffer for O-SIIs may not exceed 1% on a consolidated basis for these subsidiaries.

buffer. In this case, both the systemic risk buf -
fer as well as the G-  SII or O-  SII capital buffer 
must be complied with because it can be as -
sumed that different risks are being addressed. 
The interaction between the capital buffers is 
governed by section 10h of the Banking Act.
All capital buffers shall be made up of common 
equity tier 1 capital. The sum of all the buffers 
applicable to a given institution is known as the 
combined buffer requirement (section 10i of 
the Banking Act). Restrictions on distributions 
may be imposed on an institution that fails to 
comply with the combined buffer requirement, 
or is in danger of failing to comply. Moreover, 
such an institution shall be required to submit a 
capital conservation plan to BaFin and the Bun -
desbank within five working days. BaFin shall 
assess this capital conservation plan, and shall 
approve this plan if it considers that its imple -
mentation would be reasonably likely to enable 
the institution to meet its combined buffer re -
quirement within a period which BaFin con -
siders appropriate.
Alongside the implementation of CRD IV in 
German law, amendments will also be made to 
the reporting requirements for loans of €1.5 
million (as from 2015: €1 million) or more as 
per section 14 of the Banking Act; these are 
purely national rules for which there are no 
harmonised minimum standards at the Euro -
pean level. Besides reducing the reporting 
threshold to €1 million, the amendments in -
clude broadening the definition of the term 
“credit” and introducing independent rules 
governing the creation of groups of connected 
clients for the purpose of reporting these loans. 
The modifications take account of the greater 
need for information – particularly in the wake 
of the financial crisis – in both macroprudential 
oversight and microprudential banking supervi -
sion. Longer and more detailed reports will 
allow microprudential supervisors to conduct 
more thorough analyses of institutions’ credit 
portfolios. The ability to identify and analyse 
risk concentrations in the banking sector more 
accurately, meanwhile, will improve the analyt -ical scope available in macroprudential surveil -
lance. The current reporting threshold of €1.5 
million will not be reduced to €1 million until 
2015, thereby giving industry and supervisors 
alike sufficient advance warning and planning 
certainty.
The new internal governance regime reflects 
the lessons learned from the financial crisis and 
is designed to enhance institutions’ corporate 
governance and internal control mechanisms. 
In future, section 25d of the Banking Act will 
require institutions’ management and supervis -
ory bodies to set up risk, audit, nomination and 
remuneration committees whose tasks will in -
clude advising the supervisory body on the in -
stitution’s overall risk appetite and strategy, as -
sisting it in overseeing the implementation of 
the risk management system, in remedying any 
deficiencies identified by auditors, and in iden -
tifying suitable candidates to fill vacancies in 
senior management. The remuneration com -
mittee has the task of overseeing the appropri -
ateness of the remuneration policies. Accord -
ing to the principle of proportionality, these 
committees do not have to be set up, however, 
if the size and systemic importance of the insti -
tution as well as the nature, scope, complexity 
and riskiness of its business activities so permit. 
Additionally, institutions are required to set up 
a compliance function which, as part of the in -
ternal control system, is responsible for the as -
sessment, quality assurance and monitoring of 
internal arrangements designed to ensure com -
pliance with material legislation. Institutions 
are moreover required to set up an internal 
whistle- blowing system which allows employ -
ees to report breaches of supervisory law and 
any criminal acts without divulging their iden -
tity.

agement bodies of institutions. Section 25a (5) 
of the Banking Act sets an upper limit for the 
ratio of variable to fixed remuneration. There is 
a limit on variable remuneration of 100% of 
the fixed remuneration, which may be raised 
to 200% of the fixed remuneration with share -
holder approval. Added to this, institutions are 
required to base their remuneration policies on 
sustainability. The rules governing the structure 
of remuneration policies, particularly regarding 
the retention, reduction or cancellation of 
bonus payments, are be fleshed out in the 
Regulation Governing Remuneration at Institu -
tions (Institutsvergütungsverordnung) , which is 
to be amended during the course of this year.
The country- specific disclosure requirements 
set forth in CRD IV will be transposed into Ger -
man law in section 26a of the Banking Act. In 
future, institutions covered by the CRR will be 
required to disclose information, broken down 
by member state of the European Union and 
third country in which they operate a branch, 
inter alia  on their turnover, profit or loss and 
taxes as well as any public subsidies they have 
received.
The transposition of CRD IV will expand the list 
of administrative offences set forth in section 
56 of the Banking Act and also significantly in -
creases the level of fines. BaFin will have the 
power to impose fines of up to €5 million if 
certain prudential supervisory requirements are 
breached. Furthermore, legal entities could 
face fines of up to 10% of the institute’s annual 
net turnover in the previous year or twice the 
amount of the benefit derived from the breach. 
The new section 60b of the Banking Act will 
allow the German national authorities to pub -
lish all the measures and fines which BaFin has 
imposed against natural persons or legal en -
tities and have become legally enforceable, and 
final and absolute in law, on BaFin’s website.Key amendments to 
 regulations
Since many regulatory areas currently enshrined 
in national law will in future be covered by the 
CRR, both the Solvency Regulation (Solvabili -
tätsverordnung)  and the Large Exposures Regu -
lation (Großkredit- und Millionenkreditverord -
nung)  will become much less substantial in 
scope.
Solvency Regulation
The rules currently contained in the Solvency 
Regulation requiring institutions to maintain 
adequate capital to cover credit, market and 
operational risk will in future mostly be gov -
erned by the directly applicable CRR. The Solv -
ency Regulation will therefore be recast on a 
much smaller scale. Among other things, the 
recast Solvency Regulation will contain proced -
ural rules on the application and notification 
obligations set forth in the CRR, particularly 
those dictating the format of notifications and 
reports and the manner in which they are sub -
mitted to the supervisory authorities.
The CRR grants national authorities a degree of 
discretion with regard to a number of provi -
sions. The Solvency Regulation chiefly uses this 
scope for the internal approaches for the calcu -
lation of capital requirements, notably the im -
plementing legislation governing the approval 
processes for Internal Ratings- Based (IRB) ap -
proaches, market risk models, internal models 
used for calculating counterparty risk as well as 
advanced measurement approaches (AMAs) 
for operational risk. The CRR rules were worded 
in such a way that the existing Solvency Regu -
lation legislation fleshing out the CRD version 
that is currently in force will, as far as possible, 
remain unchanged, thereby also limiting the 
adjustments that institutions will need to make 
in order to implement the new provisions.
The new Solvency Regulation likewise specifies 
what criteria mortgage property values must Country- specific

meet to be eligible under the CRR, as the CRR 
allows the mortgage property value of immov -
able property to be used for calculating the risk 
weights of exposures secured by mortgages 
only in those member states that have laid 
down rigorous criteria for the assessment of 
the mortgage lending value in statutory or 
regulatory provisions.
The new Solvency Regulation additionally spe -
cifies some aspects of the transitional arrange -
ments in connection with the introduction of 
the new capital requirements and the calcula -
tion of the new capital buffers.
Regulation governing large 
 exposures and loans of 
€1.5 million or more (Large 
 Exposures Regulation)
The definitions of large exposures and the cor -
responding upper limits, the methods used for 
calculating exposure values or the provisions 
governing capital relief and credit protection 
instruments which were previously contained 
in the Large Exposures Regulation will form 
part of the CRR in future. The Large Exposures 
Regulation, meanwhile, will transpose the op -
tions that the CRR grants to national supervis -
ory authorities as well as national specificities.
As hitherto, the new Large Exposures Regula -
tion will continue to have separate sections 
dealing with large exposures and with loans of 
€1.5 million (as from 2015: €1 million) or more. 
However, distinct procedures will be reintro -
duced for the reporting of large exposures and 
of loans of €1.5 million (as from 2015: €1 mil -
lion) or more. The first section of the Regula -
tion (large exposures) contains implementing 
legislation regarding exemptions,26 decision-  
making requirements and the reporting pro -
cedure. The plan to limit the full exemption 
currently granted, under certain circumstances, 
to exposures within a group of institutions 
to 50% of own funds represents a material change to the existing rules governing exemp -
tions.
The second section of the Large Exposures 
Regulation will, for the most part, contain the 
existing rules governing loans of €1.5 million 
(as from 2015: €1 million) or more as well as 
extensive rules governing reporting procedures.
Amendments to other 
 regulations
In line with a recommendation by the Inter -
national Monetary Fund (IMF), the implemen -
tation of CRD IV will also see the introduction 
of the Financial Information Regulation (Finanz-
informationenverordnung)  on the basis of 
the new section 25 of the Banking Act, which 
in future will also contain provisions governing 
the internal capital adequacy assessment 
 information that institutions are required to 
submit to supervisors. The Financial Infor -
mation Regulation replaces the Monthly Re -
turns Regulation (Monatsausweisverordnung)  
and the Summarised Monthly Returns Regula -
tion (Zusammengefasste- Monatsausweise-  
Ver ord nung) . Building on the existing monthly 
returns, the Financial Information Regulation 
will allow supervisors to close the data gaps 
identified during the course of the financial cri -
sis and thus also enhance their macropruden -
tial analytical capabilities. These information 
requirements will now be covered by what is 
known as the basic reporting procedure.
The new reporting requirements under the 
basic reporting procedure are directed at credit 
institutions and replace the obligation to sub -
mit monthly returns, which will be integrated 
into the Financial Information Regulation. In fu -
ture, the Financial Information Regulation will 
allow authorities to collect intrayear profit and Large Exposures

loss data as well as further financial informa -
tion supplemented by target figures on institu -
tions’ earnings situation. Individual institutions 
will also be required to disclose data on their 
hidden reserves and hidden losses, the risks 
arising from lending business, the interest rate 
risk in the banking book and on the terms and 
structural contribution, thereby enhancing au -
thorities’ ability to analyse each institution’s risk 
situation. These new reporting requirements 
for credit institutions will give supervisors 
deeper and more timely insight into institu -
tions’ business developments. The reporting 
criteria introduced for financial services institu -
tions under the Financial Information Regula -
tion are essentially identical to the existing 
monthly reporting obligations.
The disclosure requirements for groups of insti -
tutions that are required to report under the 
Financial Information Regulation are much the 
same as those for individual institutions insofar 
as groups of institutions are also obliged to 
submit intrayear earnings data, target figures 
and other data. The existing provisions requir -
ing groups of institutions to disclose their in -
vestment position on a consolidated basis will 
likewise be integrated into the Financial Infor -
mation Regulation and thus replace the corres -
ponding requirements of the Summarised 
Monthly Returns Regulation.
By contrast, institutions that prepare consoli -
dated financial statements on the basis of the 
IFRS fall within the scope of the EBA’s harmon -
ised reporting requirements. Such institutions 
are required to submit corresponding reports 
under the EU financial reporting (FINREP) 
framework and are exempted from the Finan -
cial Information Regulation reporting obliga -
tions with the exception of certain data, inter 
alia on the interest rate risk in the banking 
book.
Until the LCR has been fully phased in as a min -
imum liquidity standard, the national minimum 
liquidity criteria and liquidity disclosure require -
ments can coexist alongside the LCR as legally binding standards. Once the LCR has been 
phased in, all German banks will be required to 
comply with the European provisions pursuant 
to section 1 of the Banking Act. Exceptions will 
only be made for housing enterprises with sav -
ings facilities, guarantee banks, central coun -
terparties and financial services institutions, 
which will continue to be subject to national 
standards. Whether and to what extent the 
LCR will also be mandatory for CRR investment 
firms is a matter that will be decided at a later 
date on the basis of a report by the European 
Commission.
Outlook
Given that a genuine banking union is predi -
cated on the existence of a single rulebook, the 
CRD IV package can truly be regarded as a key 
stepping stone towards a more comprehensive 
banking union project. The simplest and quick -
est way to create a single rulebook is by enact -
ing regulations –  that is, directly applicable 
European legislation – which, unlike directives, 
do not need to be transposed into national law 
by intermediate institutions. The same can be 
said about the binding technical standards 
(BTS) produced by the EBA and the European 
Commission, for which the CRR and CRD IV 
contain numerous enabling provisions. The 
European Commission and the EBA are tasked 
with ensuring the consistent interpretation and 
application of both the CRR and the BTS 
throughout Europe.
Besides “Europeanising” substantive legislation 
in the field of banking regulation, the banking 
union will also partially shift actual banking 
supervision to the European level. The planned 
Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) will see 
key prudential powers being transferred to the 
ECB.
The harmonisation of bank recovery and reso -
lution legislation in the Bank Recovery and 
Resolution Directive (BRRD) is another initiative 
that is currently being finalised. Plans are like -FINREP users

wise under way to also transfer institutional 
powers in the field of banking resolution (Sin -
gle Resolution Mechanism, or SRM). However, 
this legislative initiative is likely to necessitate an amendment to primary legislation, should it 
lead to the creation of a European resolution 
authority or fund.Deutsche Bundesbank
