5CommentariesEconomic conditions
Underlying trends
After a buoyant start to the year, the German
economy shifted towards a somewhat more
moderate pace of growth in the second quar-
ter of 2011 as expected. Although the eco-
nomic situation of German enterprises is still
considered to be exceptionally good, the ex-
tremely optimistic business expectations that
prevailed over the winter months have been
scaled back somewhat of late. Excluding the
manufacture of other transport equipment,
which accounts for most large orders, the
flow of new orders has been characterised by
a sideways movement since the beginning of
the year. Industrial output in April was up
only marginally on the average of the first
quarter in seasonally adjusted terms. Season-
ally adjusted construction output was down
significantly on the first quarter, which had
been boosted by catch-up effects. Exports
just about held up at the high level of the pre-
vious quarter. Private consumption is unlikely
to have provided any new stimuli. There was
a further improvement in the labour market
situation, although at a more moderate pace.
Industry
Seasonally adjusted industrial output in April
was down slightly on the March figure, which
was revised upwards. Output rose3/4%o n
the average of the first quarter. After adjust-
ment for holiday effects, output is unlikely
to have exceeded the level of the previous
quarter.Slowdown in

6Demand for industrial goods in April went up
by a seasonally adjusted 23/4% on the month
and by 11/2% on the quarter. This was once
again attributable primarily to orders in the
manufacture of other transport equipment.
Excluding these large orders, which will have
an impact on output over a prolonged period
of time, demand would have been down
slightly on the first quarter. Demand for inter-
mediate goods matched the high level of
the preceding quarter. By contrast, consumer
goods orders picked up. Demand for capital
goods went up overall but declined after ex-
cluding the manufacture of other transport
equipment. In regional terms, export orders,
at 2%, grew distinctly faster than domestic
demand (1%). Orders from the euro area
rose only slightly (3/4%), whereas those from
non-euro-area countries went up by 23/4%,
which was due to the aforementioned large
orders.
While there was a perceptible seasonally ad-
justed rise in domestic sales in April compared
with both the previous month and the aver-
age of the previous quarter, export sales de-
clined slightly. Although exports of goods in
April more or less maintained the average
level of the first quarter after adjustment for
seasonal variations, they declined sharply fol-
lowing a rapid increase in March. The value
of imports likewise decreased.
Construction
Seasonally adjusted construction output in
April contracted considerably compared with
the first quarter, when the weather-related
production backlogs from December wereEconomic conditions in Germany*

7largely worked off. This fall-off was due
mainly to building construction. In civil engin-eering, on the other hand, the elevated levelof average output of the previous monthswas maintained. There was a significant risein construction orders in March in bothcivil engineering and housing construction,whereas orders in the other construction sec-tors declined perceptibly.
Labour marketThe labour market situation continued to im-
prove in the second quarter of 2011, albeit ata more moderate pace than in the first fewmonths of the year. According to the provi-sional figures of the Federal Statistical Office,the number of persons in work in Germanyin April went up by a seasonally adjusted28,000 on the month. Compared with theprevious year, this corresponds to an increaseof 515,000, or 1.3%. The number of personsin jobs subject to full social security contri-butions is likely to have increased further. InMarch, year-on-year job growth amounted to692,000, or 2.5%. According to the Ifo em-ployment barometer and the Federal Employ-ment Agency’s jobs index, the willingness ofenterprises to recruit new staff decreasedsomewhat in May, although it still remains ata very high level.
The official unemployment figure declined
marginally in May by a seasonally adjusted8,000 to 2.97 million. The seasonally adjustedunemployment rate (using the Federal Em-ployment Agency’s definition) fell to 7.0%.Given that the labour market policy measuresare now being reduced as a result of theimproved employment situation, unemploy-
ment in the broader sense fell much moresharply than the official jobless figure(328,000 over 12 months compared with276,000 in the previous year).
PricesAfter the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil
had risen to US$123 in April, it fell back inMay to US$114
1/2and thus came close to
matching the level recorded in March; but itwas still half as high again as the prior-yearfigure (almost a third higher in euro terms).Oil prices fluctuated relatively strongly in mid-June amid uncertainty about OPEC’s futurestrategy. The spot price stood at US$114 asthis report went to press. Prices for future de-liveries of crude oil were being quoted at dis-counts across the entire maturity range.
Price developments at the upstream stages of
the economy were mixed of late. Imports inApril were a seasonally adjusted 0.3% cheap-er than in March on the back of the strongereuro. By contrast, prices of domestically pro-duced goods went up by 1.0% in line withthe current economic momentum. The year-on-year rise in import prices slowed to 9.4%,while that of domestic producer prices accel-erated to 6.4%.
Consumer prices recorded a further month-
on-month rise in May after seasonal adjust-ment despite the marked price reductions forenergy in some cases, even though, at 0.1 %,it was significantly weaker than in previousmonths. Food prices went up by almost 1%on the month, which was due primarily toEmployment

8dearer dairy products. The prices of other
goods also rose in seasonally adjusted terms,
owing in part to the increase in tobacco tax.
The prices of services remained unchanged
on average. Annual inflation declined from
2.4% to 2.3% according to the national CPI
and from 2.7% to 2.4% according to the
HICP.
Public finances1
Public long-term care insurance scheme
The public long-term care insurance scheme
recorded a slight deficit in the first quarter of
2011. This reflects a certain deterioration in
the financial situation. The pace of growth on
both the revenue and expenditure sides was
considerably weaker than in the previous
quarters (just over 1% and 3%, respectively).
Although, at almost 31/2%, employee contri-
butions rose quite sharply, contributions on
behalf of recipients of unemployment bene-
fits were down significantly on the year by
11 %. Furthermore, pensioner contributions
remained static following the waiver of the
pension adjustment in mid-2010 and given
the current flat trend in the number of pen-
sioners.
The slowdown in the rate of growth on the
expenditure side continued. While spending
on out-patient long-term care services in-
creased by almost 4%, cash benefits to
persons in need of nursing care grew at a
much weaker pace (+1%). The slower rate of
expenditure growth (although it is still out-
stripping revenue growth) is partly attribut-able to the fact that benefit rates were not
raised at the beginning of 2011. The liquid
reserves fell to just under €5 billion by the
end of March.
In 2011 as a whole, a small surplus could be
achieved again, provided the economic en-
vironment remains favourable. However,
deficits are forecast from 2012 onwards at
the latest. This is because, if the contribution
rate remains unchanged at 1.95% (plus
0.25% for the childless), expenditure is likely
to grow at a much faster pace than revenue2
due to increasing benefit rates. Nevertheless,
the sizeable reserves of just over 21/2of
monthly expenditure will suffice for several
years.3However, in the medium term, given
the foreseeable demographic developments,
there is no alternative to raising the contri-
bution rate or limiting the level of benefits.
Although the payment burden can be shifted
between the generations by means of greater
capital funding, ultimately it cannot be re-
duced.
1In the short commentaries on public finances, the em-
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the
Monthly Reports (published in February, May, August
and November), by contrast, contain a detailed descrip-
tion of the development of public finances during the
preceding quarter. For detailed data on budgetary devel-
opments and public debt, see the statistical section of
this report. The statutory health insurance fund’s finan-
cial results for the first quarter of 2011 were not yet avail-
able when this report went to press.
2The next increment is scheduled for 1 January 2012.
On a weighted average, the benefit rates will then in-
crease by approximately 2%. After this, the Federal Gov-
ernment will decide at the beginning of 2014, and subse-
quently at three-yearly intervals, whether to raise the
rates again, basing its decision on general price develop-
ments. However, long-term care benefit rates must not
increase more sharply than nominal gross wages and sal-
aries per employee (section 30 of the Eleventh Book of
the Social Security Code).
3The minimum reserve amounts to half of an average
month’s expenditure (section 64 of the Eleventh Book of
the Social Security Code).Slight increase

9Securities markets
Bond market
With gross sales of €128.0 billion in April
2011, issuance in the German bond market
rose significantly on the month (€103.2 bil-
lion). However, after deducting lower re-
demptions (€112.2 billion) and after taking
account of changes in issuers’ holdings of
their own bonds, domestic debt securities
worth €6.3 billion were withdrawn from the
market in net terms. The outstanding amount
of foreign debt securities in the German mar-
ket increased by €4.2 billion during the re-
porting month, with the result that the out-
standing amount of debt instruments in the
German market as a whole decreased by
€2.1 billion.
Domestic credit institutions reduced their
capital market debt by €10.5 billion net in
April. Public Pfandbriefe and other bank debt
securities, in particular, were redeemed (€5.7
billion and €5.5 billion net respectively) as
well as, to a lesser extent, mortgage Pfand-
briefe (€0.7 billion). Only specialised credit
institutions, which include public promotional
banks for example, were net bond issuers to
the tune of €1.5 billion.
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises
also redeemed €3.5 billion of their own
bonds in net terms, compared with net issu-
ance of €1.2 billion in March. On balance,
these were all bonds with a maturity of less
than one year.In April, the public sector issued debt secur-
ities worth €7.7 billion net, of which €4.1 bil-
lion was issued by central government. While
the outstanding volume of two-year Federal
Treasury notes (Schätze) and of ten and
thirty-year Federal bonds (Bunds) rose by
€5.1 billion, €6.2 billion and €1.6 billion re-
spectively, there were net redemptions in par-
ticular of five-year Federal notes (Bobls) and
Federal Treasury discount paper (Bubills) in
the amount of €11.2 billion and €1.9 billion
respectively. On balance, the German Länder
tapped the capital market for €3.6 billion.
Foreign investors were the sole buyers of do-
mestic fixed-income securities (€19.7 billion
net) in April. By contrast, German non-banks,
in particular, sold €20.2 billion worth of
interest-bearing instruments, all of which onFinances of the public long-

tions sold debt securities for €1.6 billion net,
which on balance was also all in the form of
domestic paper.
In April, domestic enterprises placed a signifi-
cantly higher volume of new shares in the
German equity market (€5.6 billion) than in
March (€0.3 billion). An automaker’s capital
increase was a major factor in this. The vol-
ume of foreign equity holdings in the German
market also increased, by €2.4 billion. Look-
ing at the buyers’ side, only domestic invest-
ors acquired shares. Domestic credit institu-
tions in particular added €22.6 billion worth
of equities to their portfolios, the vast major-
ity of which were German shares. Non-banks
acquired shares for €3.1 billion net; by con-
trast, most of these were foreign equities.However, non-residents sold domestic shares
worth €17.7 billion net – as they had done in
the past in the run-up to dividend payment
dates.
In April, domestic mutual funds recorded
higher net inflows (€2.5 billion) on the month.
The sole beneficiaries were specialised funds
reserved for institutional investors (€2.7 bil-
lion), while domestic funds open to the
general public saw outflows of €0.2 billion.
Among investment companies that are ac-
cessible to all investors, bond and money
market funds in particular suffered outflows
to the tune of €0.5 billion and €0.3 billion re-
spectively, but open-end real estate funds
also recorded slight outflows of funds (€0.1
billion). By contrast, equity-based funds and
mixed funds placed new shares on the mar-
ket (€0.4 billion and €0.1 billion respectively).
During the reporting month, foreign mutual
funds also sold shares on the German market
totalling €3.2 billion. On balance, mutual
fund shares were purchased exclusively by
German non-banks (€5.8 billion), which tend-
ed to favour foreign fund shares. By contrast,
domestic credit institutions sold fund shares
in the amount of €0.1 billion net. Overall, for-
eign investors were not active at all on the
domestic fund market in April.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a
surplus – in unadjusted terms – of €8.8 billion
in April 2011. The result was thus €10.8 bil-
lion down on the level of the previous month.

11surplus and to the fact that invisible current
transactions, which comprise services, in-come and current transfers, reverted to adeficit.
Invisible current transactions posted a deficit
of €0.7 billion in April, compared with a sur-plus of €2.8 billion in March. This was chieflyattibutable to the reduced surplus in cross-border income which was down on themonth from €5.1 billion to €2.3 billion. Thisdecline was caused by high dividend pay-ments to non-residents. Furthermore, inthe services sub-account, expenditure out-weighed receipts by €1.0 billion, following acontinued surplus of the latter (€0.6 billion) inMarch. By contrast, the deficit in currenttransfers fell by €1.0 billion to €1.9 billion.
Cross-border portfolio investment also gener-
ated net capital outflows in April (€7.3 billion,compared with €5.1 billion in March). Here,domestic investors again demonstrated agreater demand for foreign securities, upfrom €0.3 billion to €9.1 billion. Their atten-tion was predominantly focused on debtsecurities (€4.2 billion). They purchasedmoney market instruments (€7.2 billion) andsold bonds and notes (€3.0 billion). In add-ition, these investors acquired both mutualfund shares (€3.2 billion) and shares (€1.6 bil-lion). Foreign investors expanded their invest-ment in Germany only to a very limiteddegree (€1.7 billion). They purchased Germandebt securities (€19.7 billion), in this casebonds and notes (€13.1 billion) and moneymarket instruments (€6.7 billion).

12ment dates, they disposed of shares (€18.0
billion).
The direct investment account recorded
modest net capital outflows (€1.5 billion,
compared with €4.8 billion one month
earlier). This was mainly due to the fact that
German enterprises provided their foreign
affiliates with funds worth €3.1 billion. They
did this primarily by means of reinvested
earnings (€3.2 billion) but also through an
increase in equity capital (€1.7 billion). Con-
versely, they withdrew funds from abroad via
intra-group credit transactions (€1.7 billion).
Foreign enterprises invested in Germany,
albeit to a reduced extent (€1.6 billion).
Other statistically recorded investment, com-
prising financial and trade credits (inasmuch
as these do not constitute a part of direct
investment) as well as bank deposits and
other assets, saw net capital exports of €7.4
billion in April. In this context, non-banksreported only moderate capital outflows
(€0.6 billion). The activities of general govern-
ment led to capital exports (€2.7 billion),
whereby a key role was played by the re-
demption of short-term loans abroad. At the
same time, transactions by enterprises and
households brought about inflows of funds
into Germany (€2.2 billion), largely as a result
of a reduction in their claims vis-à-vis non-
residents. In the banking system, outflows of
funds worth €6.8 billion were generated. This
development was due to credit institutions
recording capital outflows in the amount of
€19.4 billion which in large part arose from
the granting of short-term financial loans to
foreign counterparties. By contrast, the Bun-

13Outlook for the German economy –
macroeconomic projections for 2011 and 2012
The recovery of the German economy has evolved into a broad-based upturn. Overall production
capacity utilisation has returned to normal levels. Enterprises are hiring new staff, buying new
equipment and building new premises in preparation for a further expansion of their activities.
Residential housing construction is receiving new stimuli. Moreover, private consumption spend-
ing is rising. The rate of wage increase is accelerating, but remains compatible with macroeco-
nomic stability. There has been a further reduction in structural unemployment, and Germany is
becoming increasingly attractive for foreign workers. The prospects of the German economy ex-
periencing a lengthy period of expansion are therefore rising. This should considerably facilitate
the urgently needed consolidation of public budgets.
After economic output rose by 3.6% in 2010, economic growth could reach 3.1% this year. In
2012, it could then slow to 1.8% given above-average capacity utilisation and waning economic
catching-up effects for investment. Adjusted for a negative working-day effect, this would
equate to a gain of 2.0%. Growth would therefore far exceed potential growth again in 2012.
Survey results appear to indicate that German economic growth could even exceed the forecasts
in this baseline scenario. Conversely, any major disturbances in the global and European environ-
ment would place a major damper on the fairly strong economic upwards movement.
This forecast assumes that German enterprises can increase market share on their international
sales markets in the current year only. Given the strong momentum of global trade, exports re-
main the most important pillar of the economy. In clear contrast with the upturn of the last dec-
ade, the domestic economy has a much larger role to play this time, however, thanks to the im-
proved overall constitution of the German economy.
Consumer price inflation accelerated appreciably at the beginning of 2011 following initially
sharply higher oil prices. Crude oil prices are expected to ease slightly over the forecast horizon.
As the economic recovery gathers pace, however, prices for goods and services, which are deter-
mined to a greater extent by domestic factors, will accelerate. This forecast anticipates an in-
crease in consumer prices as defined by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) of
2.5% this year and 1.8% next year. Excluding energy, the rate of increase would work out at
1.5% and 1.6% respectively.

14Current situation
In the final quarter of 2010 and first quarter
of 2011, the German economy performed
much better than expected in the forecast
published last December. While the economic
recovery process had been expected to slow
significantly, albeit temporarily, the under-
lying economic trend is actually unlikely to
have lost much momentum. Overall econom-
ic growth in the fourth quarter of 2010 was,
at 0.4%, as low as anticipated, but this was
mainly due to the particularly harsh winter
weather, which had set in early, in Novem-
ber, and continued throughout December.
Had it not been for the associated damper, in
particular on the construction industry and
transportation, growth would probably have
been appreciably stronger. Given normal sea-
sonal weather conditions in the first quarter
of 2011, overall economic activity not only
returned to its normal level; work was also
carried out that had been postponed in the
last quarter of 2010. These catching-up and
backlog effects mean that the 1.5% GDP
growth rate for the first quarter of the year
quite considerably overstates the underlying
cyclical trend. In addition, the high outcome
for the first quarter of 2011 could be partly
due to statistical inaccuracies.
Regardless of these uncertainties there is,
nonetheless, no doubt that the December
forecast underestimated underlying cyclical
momentum. This applies to external and do-
mestic economic stimuli alike. Initially, the
damper on foreign demand was weaker than
expected. Exports in the final quarter of 2010
and first three months of 2011 therefore rosemore sharply than anticipated. The greater
utilisation of production capacity that this
entailed and the further improvement in the
business climate are likely to have been key
reasons for the unexpectedly sharp increase in
spending on new machinery and equipment.
Private consumption benefited from the extra-
ordinarily positive labour market develop-
ments and rose more quickly than anticipated.
In addition, spending on new residential
property was much higher than expected.
While investment in existing properties dom-
inated in recent years, investment in new
buildings is now more important again for
the first time in a long while. A clear recovery
can be seen in the construction not only of
single-family homes, but also, in particular, of
apartment buildings. The additional demand
is largely developing in urban areas, which is
in line with the above-average inflation in
real-estate prices there. This development is
likely driven by positive earnings and income
developments as well as favourable financing
conditions on the one hand and, above all,
optimistic expectations on the other. More-
over, doubts about the soundness of alterna-
tive investment forms may be another con-
tributory factor.
The residential construction industry in particu-
lar could benefit from increased immigration to
Germany. In 2010, net immigration to Ger-
many totalled almost 130,000 persons after
two years without any major net immigration.1
1The statistical picture could be distorted by the clean-
up of the population registers in 2008 and 2009 when

15This suggests that Germany has become
more attractive for foreign workers again.With complete free movement for workersfrom the EU 8 countries since May of thisyear, the flow of workers could increase ap-preciably further.
2This forecast assumes a
net inflow of 150,000 persons in 2011 and170,000 persons in 2012, of which some100,000 could, in each case, come from theEU 8 countries.
There are no signs that increased immigration
has hurt the labour market. In fact, both theincrease in employment and the decline inunemployment in the latter part of 2010 andearly part of 2011 again exceeded expect-ations at a seasonally adjusted +256,000 and-124,000 respectively.
3Hours worked, which
were reduced after production slumped in2009, have largely returned to normal.
Employees are, moreover, benefiting from
the positive economic situation in the form ofsharply higher earnings. Although the year-on-year rise in negotiated wages (+1.7%)was still very moderate in the first quarter of2011, as it was based on wage settlementsreached during the economic crisis, actualearnings on a monthly basis were 2.8% high-er. It should be noted in this context that theaverage number of hours worked rose by1.7% year on year. On an hourly basis, actualearnings therefore rose much less sharplythan negotiated wages, at 1.0%. Contribu-tory factors were a reduction in short-timework and replenishing of working time ac-counts. The wage agreements newly con-cluded in the final quarter of 2010 and firstquarter of 2011 reflect the considerably im-proved economic and labour market situation
and include large wage increases, on average– although there are remarkable differencesbetween the various sectors of industry.
Consumer price inflation has picked up per-
ceptibly. Driven by surging crude oil prices,consumer energy prices rose by 7.5% in thespace of half a year. That was the most im-portant factor in the increase in annual HICPinflation to 2.2% in the first quarter of 2011.The December projection had assumed a rateof 1.7% given a much flatter path for crudeoil prices. Excluding energy, the rate of priceincrease was 1.1%, compared with 0.9% inIndicators for residential

Major assumptions4
Although global economic growth slowed
perceptibly following the economic catching-
up process in the final months of 2009 and
early part of 2010, the prospect of further
global expansion is still intact. On a trend
basis, the pace of growth is likely to ease in a
number of those emerging economies that
are already more advanced in the economic
cycle. In some cases, such countries are even
displaying signs of overheating. By contrast,in the industrial countries, cyclical growth
forces are increasingly likely to override the
late after-effects of the global financial and
economic crisis. Moreover, progress should
be made on the structural adjustments neces-
sary for sustainable growth. The tragic events
in Japan are unlikely to have a lasting detri-
mental impact on the global economy. Over-
all, global economic growth could slightly ex-
ceed 4% in both years covered by the fore-
cast horizon.
With increasing specialisation and division
of labour, global trade should continue to
expand at an above-average rate of almost
8% a year. The emerging market economies
account for a considerable portion of this
growth although the pace of expansion is ex-
pected to slow there. By contrast, the indus-
trial nations are likely to see weaker trade
growth despite stronger expansionary forces.
German exporters should continue to benefit
from their presence in the new growth re-
gions. The volume of the German sales mar-
kets could therefore swell by 71/2% this year
and a further 7% in 2012, after +101/2%i n

17the euro stood at US$1.43, compared with
US$1.39 in the December forecast, whichequates to a gain of just under 3%. However,the single currency lost some ground againstother currencies, meaning that the effectiveeuro exchange rate, which is relevant for for-eign trade, remained largely unchanged.
As early as December 2010, particularly cold
winter weather in the northern hemispheremeant that crude oil prices exceeded the ex-pectations derived from the forward prices inthe first two weeks of November. With theunrest in a number of Arab countries, thegap widened. Averaged over the first quarterof 2011, market prices were already one-fifthabove the forecast assumption valid at thetime. In April, too, prices rose sharply further.It was not until May that a downwards cor-rection took place, probably due to weaken-ing demand. The current forecast assumesthat the average crude oil price will beUS$111 per barrel of Brent in 2011 andUS$108 per barrel in 2012. That is 25% and20% respectively more than in the Decemberforecast. Other commodity prices, which, un-like crude oil prices, had already returned topre-crisis levels – as measured in US dollars –in the third quarter of last year, were largelyin line with the expectations derived from for-ward prices in the final part of 2010 and earlypart of 2011. The assumed rates of increaseof 20% for 2011 and slightly more than 1%for 2012 differ only slightly from the Decem-ber forecast.
Short-term interest rates rose slightly more
quickly that predicted in the December fore-cast given the ongoing normalisation of themoney market, the fact that a normalisation
of the still expansionary key interest rates hasmeanwhile been initiated and the market’sexpectations of further adjustments to keyinterest rates. For the current forecast round,a short-term interest rate derived from mar-ket data (three-month interest rate on un-secured transactions on the interbank moneymarket) of 1.6% is assumed for 2011 (upfrom 1.4%) and 2.3% for 2012 (after 1.7%).Given healthy economic prospects, long-terminterest rates have also risen. On an annualaverage for 2011, German government bondswith a residual maturity of over 9 and up to10 years are expected to yield 3.3%, com-pared with 2.9% in the December projection.The figure for 2012 is now 3.6% (comparedwith 3.3% in December).

18ment are higher than assumed in the Decem-
ber projection, although the revision is small-
er than for government bonds. According to
the Bank Lending Survey, banks relaxed their
credit standards appreciably in the first quar-
ter of 2011. The ifo credit constraint indica-
tor, too, signals a further improvement. It is
assumed that this development will continue
over the forecast horizon.
In public finances, the projections take into
consideration all measures which have either
been adopted or which have already been
specified in sufficient detail and are likely to
be approved. On the revenue side, increases
in taxes and social contributions at the begin-
ning of 2011 dominate. With regard to social
contributions, additional revenue as a result
of higher contribution rates to the statutory
health insurance scheme but also to the Fed-
eral Employment Agency outweighs the
shortfall, in particular as a result of the lower
contribution rate for insolvency benefit pay-
ments.6In terms of indirect taxes, the central
government’s consolidation package will lead
to higher revenues in the current year.7On
the expenditure side, it is assumed that cap-
ital transfers to financial institutions will be
fairly small over the forecast period; these
had accounted for some1/2% of GDP last
year. In addition, most expenditure-related
economic support measures will be gradually
phased out, and social spending will be
dampened somewhat by the consolidation
package, the healthcare reform and the fact
that those pension cuts that were in principle
deemed necessary but waived owing to the
safeguard clause will be clawed back by halv-
ing the calculated pension increase from mid-2011. On the other hand, spending increases
have been agreed, especially in relation to
education and unemployment benefit II.
Cyclical outlook8
Having got off to a strong start in the first
quarter of 2011, GDP growth is likely to
be much more muted in the second quarter
of the year. That should not, however, be
interpreted as an economic slowdown. It
would actually reflect the strong influence of
catching-up and backlog effects in the first
quarter. Nonetheless, given that overall cap-
acity utilisation has returned to normal, the
still relatively high underlying pace of eco-
nomic growth is likely to ease gradually. For
full-year 2011, the calendar-adjusted fourth-
quarter GDP growth rate could total 2.6%,
after 3.8% in 2010. On an annual average,
this would – given a considerable carry-over
effect from the previous year – equate to an
increase in real economic output of 3.1% in
calendar-adjusted terms, after 3.5% the pre-
vious year. In 2012, the fourth-quarter rate
would, according to this projection, fall
further to 2.2%, yielding annual average
working-day-adjusted GDP growth of 2.0%
given a carry-over effect of 0.6%. As the
number of potential working days is lower in
6The discontinuation of government pension contribu-
tions for recipients of unemployment benefit II also
lowered revenues. However, at the general government
level, this has no impact on the deficit, as it also reduces
the Federal Government’s spending.
7This package contains a new nuclear fuel tax as well as
an air traffic tax, a gradual increase in tobacco tax and a
reduction in electricity and energy tax concessions. More-
over, a bank levy (annual contribution by credit institu-
tions to the Restructuring Fund) was introduced.

192012 than in 2011, the unadjusted annual
average GDP rate would work out at 1.8%,after 3.1% and 3.6% respectively in the twopreceding years. As compared with the De-cember forecast, this represents an upwardsrevision of the anticipated growth rates by1.1 percentage points for 2011 and 0.3 per-centage point for 2012.
According to current data, Germany’s eco-
nomic output returned to pre-crisis levels inthe first quarter of 2011. Moreover, the ag-gregate output gap, which had opened upduring the crisis, should largely have closed.Capacity utilisation in industry and of plantand equipment in the construction sector isabove its long-term average, employment isat a new high for unified Germany, enter-prises’ profitability is likely close to pre-crisislevels again, and wages and prices are risingdiscernibly. This overall macroeconomic pic-ture is not compatible with the diagnosis ofpersistent and significant overall capacityunderutilisation.
These findings are also an indication that
potential growth temporarily weakened to
3/4% as a result of the crisis.9Potential output
will probably grow by 1.1% in 2011 and1.3% in 2012. This is due not only to arenewed increase in investment activity butalso to declining structural unemploymentand rising immigration levels. Despite ex-panding potential growth, overall capacityutilisation over the forecast horizon is expect-ed to go up significantly and be clearly in ex-cess of the long-term average at the end ofthis period.In the forecast period, exports are likely to re-
main the most important mainstay of Germa-ny’s economy. The exports outlook for Ger-man enterprises remains on a clear upwardtrend although growth is not expected to beas strong as in 2010, when exports expandedat a much faster pace (almost 15%) than thesales markets (just over 10%). This reflectsthe fact that the demand for high-qualitycapital goods surged globally following thecrisis, when procurement was put on hold.This product range effect is expected to con-tinue in 2011, albeit in a much weaker form.If sales markets expand by 7
1/2%, exports
could thus grow by a little more than 8%.Technical components of the GDP

20The positive product range effect will prob-
ably be largely exhausted in 2012. Further-
more, the high utilisation of tangible fixed
assets is likely to be felt. As a result, assuming
market growth of 7% (after calendar adjust-
ment), this outlook puts growth in exports at
a similarly strong pace in 2012 (61/2% un-
adjusted, 7% after calendar adjustment).In sharp contrast with the upturn of the last
decade, the domestic economy looks like
having a much larger role to play this time,
however, thanks to the improved overall con-
stitution of the German economy. Enter-
prises’ profitability has already regained a
very elevated level, financing conditions re-
main favourable and, relatively speaking, en-
terprises and households have only minor
debt problems. Moreover, employment is ris-
ing perceptibly. Although the proportion of
temporary employment contracts and tem-
porary work has gone up, fear of unemploy-
ment has eased considerably on the whole.
All of these factors encourage households
and enterprises to make longer-term plans.
This can most clearly be seen in enterprises’
investment planning. According to surveys,
they plan to top up their investment budget
for 2011 by a sizeable amount. For the first
time in years, investment is to focus more
heavily on capacity expansion. In price-
adjusted terms, spending on new machinery
and equipment could see a 121/2% rise in
2011 and then go up from this high level by a
further 71/2% in 2012. At 61/2%, housing in-
vestment is also expected to expand consider-
ably in 2011. This item proved to be relatively
robust, not just during the economic crisis,
and saw a clear increase of 41/4% in real
terms as early as 2010. A further rise of al-
most 2% is expected for 2012. The only
sharp decline on the horizon in 2012 is in
public investment, which had been stepped
up from an already high level during the cri-
sis, in particular to support the construction
sector. All in all, after growth of 8% in 2011,

21increase by only 31/2% (4% after calendar ad-
justment) in 2012.
Given rising income and improvements on
the labour market, private consumption is ex-pected to pick up considerably despite a clearincrease in prices. Households’ disposable in-come could go up by 3
1/2% this year and 3%
next year due to a perceptible rise in netwages and salaries – despite higher effectivetaxes and social contributions – as well as inincome from entrepreneurial activity and cap-ital assets. By contrast, monetary social bene-fits received are expected to remain more orless the same owing, among other things, toa decline in unemployment. No major devel-opments are expected in household saving.The savings ratio, which climbed from 11.1%to 11.4% in 2010 once the premium forscrapping old privately used cars had expired,is expected to again fall slightly to 11.2%.This would mean an increase of 1
1/2% in real
terms in private consumption spending inboth 2011 and 2012.
The import forecast is based on the assump-
tion that the trend increase in the share ofimports in exports and in investment in ma-chinery and equipment will continue. How-ever, it is possible that growth in imports willnevertheless lag behind growth in exports in2011 as demand is more closely focused oncomponents with a relatively low import in-tensity, such as construction investment. Ifthe importance of these components wanesin relative terms in 2012 as predicted, thepercentage increase in imports would begreater than that in exports.

are taking on more staff, in part using the
services of temporary employment agencies
which, in turn, recruit staff from the labour
market. According to surveys, enterprises still
need to hire many more workers and, in the
first quarter of 2011, the number of vacan-
cies passed the one million mark. The com-
plete opening of the German labour market
to workers from the central and east Euro-
pean accession countries (with the exception
of Bulgaria and Romania), the trend towards
growing labour market participation levels
and the suspension of German national ser-
vice should make it easier for enterprises to
fill these vacancies. Temporary employment
and fixed-term employment options lower
enterprises’ risks, especially with regard to
persons who are disadvantaged on the labour
market. This forecast assumes that employ-
ment figures will expand by 1.2% in 2011
and 0.8% in 2012. The average number of
hours worked is expected to increase again
slightly in 2011 to then converge towards the
longer-term, slightly negative trend in 2012
due to the growing share of part-time work.
In line with the positive trend in employment,
unemployment will probably decline notice-
ably. After the number of persons registered
as being out of work already slipped below
3 million in seasonally adjusted terms in
April 2011, this figure is expected to fall to
2.75 million on an annual average for 2012.The unemployment rate would then amount
to 6.5%. A low of this magnitude has not
been seen in western Germany since the uni-
fication boom. The decline in unemployment
is likely to be chiefly structural. This is indi-
cated by the rates of transition from
unemployment to employment which have
been rising sharply since 2006 and can, in
turn, be attributed to the labour market re-
forms in the first half of the last decade.
Labour costs and price outlook
New collective pay agreements reached in
the final quarter of 2010 and the first quarter
of 2011 stipulate rates of increase of the like
last seen just before the crisis. Negotiated
wages are thus in step with the economic re-
covery. Those collective wage negotiations
that are yet to be concluded and those that
are still pending are also expected to result in
rather high negotiated rates both in 2011
and in 2012. The wage bargainers are likely
to keep in mind the particular features of
each economic sector, as they have done in
previous negotiations. This forecast therefore
assumes that, even if conditions on the la-
bour market are extremely favourable, wage
policy will generally remain employment-
friendly and thus attach a great deal of im-
portance to maintaining the competitiveness
of internationally active enterprises. While
this took the form of very low wage growth
during much of the previous decade, higher
growth rates are possible now that the eco-
nomic environment is more favourable. The

23sector, are expected to follow the industrial
sector’s example with a certain time lag.However, due to the continued impactof older agreements and the base effects ofone-off payments, the growth of negotiatedwages will probably fall short of the newagreements at just under 2% in 2011 and2
1/2% in 2012. These will probably not take
full effect until 2013.
The positive economic situation is likely to en-
able many enterprises to pay their employeesa profit-sharing bonus. Any scope factoredinto collective wage agreements is also ex-pected to result in an earlier, or even a larger,wage increase more frequently than in thepast. Furthermore, paid overtime is also fore-cast to continue to increase. Actual earningsare thus set to rise at a more rapid pace thannegotiated wages. On an hourly basis, thefurther decline in short-time work and the re-plenishing of working time accounts thatwere depleted during the crisis are likely tocontinue to offset the positive wage drift in2011 compared with 2010. If the burdenfrom employer contributions to social securityfunds remains broadly unchanged, wagecosts per employee will potentially increaseby 2.7% in both 2011 and 2012. Assuming aproductivity gain of 1.8% in 2011 – due, notleast, to a further rise in the average numberof hours worked – and 1.0% in 2012, unit la-bour costs would rise by 0.8% and 1.7%, re-spectively.
Profit margins, which were depressed during
the crisis, will probably continue to recover;however, given the yield level that has al-ready been reached again, at only a greatlyreduced rate. Measured by the GDP deflator,
the prices of domestically produced goodsand services could go up by just under 1% in2011 and 1
3/4% in 2012.
In 2011, consumer budgets will be strained
predominantly by the marked rise in energyprices. On an annual average, energy is ex-pected to be almost 10% more expensive; as-suming an average share of one-tenth of theconsumer’s budget, this means a 1 percent-age point contribution to inflation. Due tothe lagged effects of higher crude oil priceson gas prices and the shared cost of amen-ities as well as to continually rising costs for amore environmentally friendly generation ofelectricity, energy prices will probably in-crease disproportionately in 2012, too – al-Price projection*

24though, at just under 3%, at a much weaker
rate than in 2011.
The economic recovery is also making its
presence known in the prices of other goods
and services, whereby it is not always possible
to draw a clear distinction between external
and domestic influences, especially as the
German economy is developing in line with
the global economy. At any rate, import
prices and domestic producer prices of indus-
trial goods have been characterised by a simi-
larly sharp increase. The impact of global
markets on some agricultural prices can also
be clearly felt. Furthermore, rising wages
and improved demand are likely to trigger a
somewhat stronger increase in the prices of
services and in housing rents. Overall, meas-
ured by the HICP, consumer prices are ex-
pected to increase by 2.5% in 2011 and then
by 1.8% in 2012.
Public finances10
The public finance situation deteriorated
sharply in the last two years. In 2010, the
general government deficit ratio was 3.3%
and, at 83.2%, the debt ratio reached a new
record level.11A step-by-step recovery now
looks likely provided the fiscal stance is not
eased and additional burdens as a result of
the financial and sovereign debt crisis remain
strictly limited. Consolidation will be facili-
tated by the highly favourable economic
conditions from which general government
budgets will benefit not only in cyclical terms
but also in the form of lower structural un-employment and a renewed rise in rates of
potential growth.
The deficit ratio could fall below 2% in 2011.
This will be aided in roughly equal parts by
the ongoing cyclical recovery and a clear
structural improvement. By contrast, the ab-
sence of the one-off effects recorded in 2010
(proceeds from the radio frequencies auction,
higher insolvency benefit contributions) will
have a negative impact. On the revenue side,
the structural factors include increases in so-
cial contributions and indirect taxes. The ex-
pected marked reduction in the structural ex-
penditure ratio is mainly attributable to the
fact that the transfer of capital to financial in-
stitutions is now assumed to be only relatively
low. In addition, the expenditure trend is like-
ly to be slightly restrictive due to the phasing
out of some economic stimuli (in particular,
measures to support the labour market) and
to central government’s consolidation pack-
age.
As things currently stand, a further deficit
reduction is envisaged for 2012 although,
unlike in 2011, the economic cycle will prob-
ably have only a slightly positive impact. The
(structural) revenue ratio may remain largely
unchanged, while the structural expenditure
ratio may decline somewhat more sharply
10The financial development of general government is
described here as defined in the national accounts; this
definition is also largely used as the basis for the fiscal ref-
erence values of the FEU Treaty (also known as the Maas-
tricht criteria). For a more detailed analysis for general
government as well as central, state and local govern-
ment levels and the social security funds, see Deutsche

25than in 2011. This is due, in particular, to
slow pension growth, which is expected
under current regulations, as well as to lower
spending on the labour market as a result of
a structural decline in the number of persons
out of work. Moreover, temporary measures
to support the economy are coming to an
end. This is especially true for the investment
programmes under the government econom-
ic stimulus packages which, once again, have
demonstrated a particularly pronounced time
lag. All in all, the government budget will still
post a clear structural deficit next year in an
environment where overall capacity utilisation
is above average. Thus, further consolidation
is necessary to achieve the medium-term ob-
jective of a (close-to-) balanced budget and
to provide for the upcoming demopraphic
burdens in the years ahead.
Uncertainty with regard to the development
of the debt ratio is still high. Taken in isol-
ation, lower deficits coupled with relatively
high nominal GDP growth bring about a de-
cline. However, sizeable risks exist in connec-
tion with the European aid programmes for
euro-area countries and support measures for
German financial institutions.
Risk assessment
The baseline scenario presented here assumes
smooth global economic development in
which the German economy participates suc-
cessfully thanks to its openness. Growth is
being slowed by an increasing utilisation of
overall capacity. The projected rise in shortand long-term interest rates prevents signs of
overheating.
It is conceivable that, under these conditions,
the market share gains of German enterprises
will be larger than those in the forecast’s
main scenario, at least in the short term. It is
also possible that the domestic component
will receive more of an impetus than assumed
here. High GDP results for the first quarter ofBaseline and uncertainty

262011, which are difficult to interpret, may be
an indication of this.
In the medium term, an increase in fixed
capital formation and immigration could
strengthen potential output to such a degree
that tension-free growth would be possible
even at a more rapid pace of expansion. If
the expected interest rate rise does not occur,
there could be a boom in the construction
sector in particular, but it will not be particu-
larly sustainable. Major disruptions in global
economic development would probably have
a direct effect on the German economy. Un-
certainty on the financial markets is up again
given the difficult situation of public finances
in a number of industrial countries.
With regard to price stability, short to
medium-term risks are primarily connectedwith the international commodity markets.
Commodity prices have already returned to a
high level, and crude oil prices are still likely
to contain a certain risk premium despite the
latest corrections. However, a sharper rise
cannot be ruled out given the almost un-
checked economic expansion of the emer-
ging market economies. This will be especially
likely if the industrial countries as a whole re-
cover at a faster-than-expected pace. If over-
all economic growth in Germany in a low
interest rate environment proves to be much
higher than in our projection and continues
across the forecast horizon, in the context of
only a moderate increase in growth rates of
potential output, there is a risk of medium to
long-term signs of overheating. This would
be detrimental to price stability.

27Sovereign yield spreads in the euro area
In the course of the financial and economic crisis, and particularly since the beginning of the sov-
ereign debt crisis, sovereign yield spreads have increased considerably in some parts of the euro
area. As these spreads are important measures of governments’ relative financing conditions,
they have become the focus of public attention. In addition, they have raised questions as to why
Greece, Ireland and Portugal have had their access to the capital markets restricted following the
crisis, as well as about the economic policy implications.
A detailed analysis of individual countries’ sovereign yield spreads over German Federal bonds
(Bunds) is simplified by decomposing them into three elements demanded by risk-averse invest-
ors as compensation for not investing in secure and liquid benchmark bonds. These components
are the expected loss resulting from the credit risk, the risk premium as compensation for pos-
sible unexpected losses or elevated volatility throughout the maturity of the bond, and the liquid-
ity premium. Such a decomposition reveals that, from the investor’s point of view, it is possible
to trace the strong expansion of some peripheral countries’ yield spreads back to an increased
sovereign credit risk as it reflects unfavourable fundamentals such as the debt ratio, budget def-
icit, current account balance, price competitiveness and the state of the financial sector. In add-
ition, an overall increase in risk aversion and a rise in liquidity premiums also temporarily contrib-
uted to a considerable degree to the expansion of yield spreads.
The central role of weak fundamentals in the context of some euro-area countries’ sovereign
debt crisis underlines the necessity for the whole euro area to apply strict budgetary discipline. It
is essential for the peripheral countries, in particular, to additionally implement structural reforms
to strengthen competitiveness and the growth outlook in order to meet the requirements for a
sustainable level of sovereign debt and regain access to capital markets. This is of utmost import-
ance as investors will probably continue to discriminate between the government bonds of indi-
vidual euro-area countries. As a disciplining role of the market – one which has not always been
sufficiently played by the market in the past – offers an incentive for sustainable long-term public
finances in the euro area, regulatory or other measures which would impair the information con-
tent of yield spreads, as well as their capacity to send signals and set incentives, should be avoid-
ed.

28Measurement and implications of
euro-area yield spreads
While sovereign bond spreads in euro-area
countries represent the absolute financing
costs of public sector debt in the market,
yield spreads between bonds from different
countries are not only an important measure
of relative financing conditions, but also indi-
cate the degree of integration in the euro-
area sovereign bond markets. The strong
widening of spreads has attracted growing
public attention, especially since the escal-
ation of the sovereign debt crisis in some
euro-area peripheral countries.
In order for yield spreads to be measured, an
appropriate benchmark value must be select-
ed. An option would be to use the fixed rate
of overnight index swaps (OIS). In the context
of such an interest rate swap, fixed interest
payments are exchanged for variable ones,
with the variable interest rate in the euro area
being equivalent to the overnight interest
rate (EONIA). As the parties to the contract
only exchange the interest payment differ-
ences and not the underlying nominal value,
the default risk for OIS is only minor.
An alternative would be to use the yield of a
fairly safe and liquid government bond. For
the duration of this ten-year maturity, which
was the basis of his study, German Federal
bonds (Bunds) were used here, as they are
known to entail virtually no risk.1Furthermore,
the high liquidity of Bunds, which has been
aided by the particularly liquid market for
Euro-Bund futures, has contributed signifi-
cantly to the benchmark status of Bunds.Even before the introduction of the euro at
the beginning of 1999, an interest rate con-
vergence process had already begun to un-
fold in the markets for European government
bonds. This reflected the markets’ confidence
that inflation expectations in the single cur-
rency area would remain at a permanently
low level – provided that a single monetary
policy was applied. In addition, the exchange
rate risk between participating countries had
been gradually declining prior to the monet-
ary union. While average ten-year govern-
ment bond yields of those 11 countries which
introduced the euro in 1999 were still be-
tween 6.9% and 12.6% for all of 1995, this
spread only ranged from 4.5% to 4.8% in
January 1999.
The bursting of the New Economy bubble
temporarily created major uncertainty among
market participants and then initially caused
yields to spread again slightly. However, as
the markets subsequently calmed down, in-
vestors no longer discriminated a great deal
between different euro-area government
bonds. Since 2005, euro-area member states
with a low rating recorded a moderate in-
crease in their yield spreads, whereas the
spreads of those countries with a better rat-
ing remained broadly stable at a low level.
The financial crisis, which originated in the US
real estate market in mid-2007, initially had
virtually no negative impact on the markets
for European government bonds. Smaller
fluctuations notwithstanding, member states’
yield spreads over Bunds remained relatively

points at around end-August 2008.
Since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in Sep-
tember 2008, however, euro-area sovereignspreads diverged considerably. While theprices of “safe” government bonds issued bycore euro-area countries were fuelled byshifts, in some cases strong, from other formsof investment, the prices of Greek and Irishbonds came under noticeable pressure at thebeginning of 2009, which caused the re-spective spreads to climb to just under 3 per-centage points. Amongst other things, this isto be seen against the backdrop of the finan-cial crisis increasingly representing a strain tooverall economic activity and, by extension,to general government budgets. Since thebeginning of 2010, the debt crisis experi-enced several waves of intensification. Mar-
ket participants were less and less inclined tokeep or purchase bonds from the peripheralcountries (Greece, Ireland and Portugal),pushing the yield spreads to record highs of15.4, 8.9 and 8.1 percentage points respect-ively (admittedly given low turnover) despiteinternational rescue measures for these coun-tries. Other euro-area government bonds, egSpanish and Italian securities, also sufferedlosses in this environment. However, thesewere substantially lower compared to thethree above-mentioned countries.

30from just under 70 basis points at the begin-
ning of 2010 to around 470 basis points as
this report went to press. The fact that most
of the countries in question are relatively
small economies is reflected in the respective
country’s GDP-weighted standard deviation.
However, this standard deviation has in-
creased, too, from 15 basis points to just over
85 basis points at last report.
Determinants of yield spreads
Yield spreads reflect numerous factors which
can be systematically grouped according to
different criteria. For example, determinants
can be grouped according to supply and de-
mand factors in the markets for government
bonds or according to country-specific andglobal factors. In the course of the sovereign
debt crisis, another type of distinction has
suggested itself: between determinants initi-
ated by private market participants and those
which can be linked to public institutions,
such as international rescue measures.
A further, analytical systematisation is based
on compensation demanded by risk-averse
investors for not investing in secure and liquid
benchmark bonds. According to this ap-
proach, yield spreads can be divided into dif-
ferent components. Firstly, investors demand
compensation for the expected loss resulting
from the issuer’s credit risk. Secondly, in re-
turn for the uncertainty of the actual losses
incurred at the time of maturity possibly ex-
ceeding the expected loss, a risk premium is
expected. Investors whose investment hori-
zon falls short of the period until maturity de-
mand an appropriate compensation for the
possibility of – compared with the benchmark
bond – higher fluctuations occurring during
the life of the bond. Another element, the li-
quidity premium, provides compensation for
the possibility that the investor can only ac-
quire and sell the bond at relatively unfavour-
able terms. As will be discussed below, the
financial and sovereign debt crisis has affected
all yield spread components listed above.
Credit risk
The expected loss component indicates the
creditworthiness of the government bond is-
suer. In statistical terms, this component rep-
resents the likelihood of a payment default
multiplied by the rate of default, ie the per-
centage of the credit claim which is irretriev-Yield spreads

31able after a default. When assessing this com-
ponent of the yield, investors must take intoaccount that the reasons for a sovereign de-fault are different to those for a private sectorinsolvency. An enterprise must file for bank-ruptcy if it is no longer able to make its pay-ments, at risk of defaulting or over-indebted.By contrast, a sovereign default is more com-plicated, as it depends a great deal more onpolitical decisions by the government or theparliament of the country in question. Suchdecisions are strongly influenced by the will-ingness to pay, which is generally subject tovarious influences.
2The same also applies to
the extent of the loss actually incurred by theinvestors in the case of default (“loss givendefault”). Important fundamental determin-ants of creditworthiness are fiscal determin-ants such as the budget balance and the debtratio, the state of the financial sector and thecurrent account balance or price competitive-ness. In practice, assessments by rating agen-cies also serve as a guideline for credit risk.
A key determinant of credit risk and, by ex-
tension, of expected loss, is the market par-ticipants’ assessment of the long-term sus-tainability of a country’s public debt. Againstthe backdrop of the financial crisis-inducedeconomic slump, the in some cases highlosses in the financial sector and the costs ofeconomic stabilisation measures, scepticismtowards some euro-area countries has in-creased considerably. This suggests that theexpected budget deficit and the debt levelare exerting a positive influence on yieldspreads. In fact, a relationship of this kind canbe empirically proven for the euro area.
3For
instance, in the case of Greece, the consider-able upward revision of the 2009 budget def-
icit in October 2009 and the less favourablefiscal outlook caused yield spreads to rise per-ceptibly, eventually leading to the request forthe international aid package in April 2010.
The increase in yields of government debt se-
curities in some peripheral countries is likelyto have repercussions on the sustainability ofpublic debt by worsening the relationship be-tween financing costs and the outlook forgrowth.
4This relationship quantifies the pri-
mary surpluses – excess of revenue over ex-penditure, excluding interest payments –needed to stabilise the debt ratio. Countrieswhose sovereign bonds have come undergreat pressure and whose new issues there-fore became more expensive will need togenerate especially high primary surpluses inthe coming years in order to guarantee thesustainability of public debt and to (re)gainthe trust necessary to access the capital mar-ket.
In addition, the financial crisis has made it evi-
dent that public finances can be put underconsiderable strain by rescue measures forthe financial sector, eg government stake-
2Duffie et al (2003) point out that governments weigh
the advantages against the disadvantages when making
a decision about defaulting and that political factors and
personal incentives can be of relevance in this context.
Among the disadvantages of default are the possible loss
of assets held abroad, the loss of reputation and a nega-
tive impact on access to capital markets and international
trade. The advantage cited is cost savings due to avoiding
the servicing of debt. See D Duffie, L H Pedersen and

32Deutsche BundesbankComponents of euro-area sovereign spreads
The sudden widening of euro-area sovereign bond spreads,
which had previously moved in a narrow range, has been attrib-
uted to a host of causes, most of which are connected with the
global financial crisis. For instance, it became clear at an early
stage that the financial crisis would place a considerable strain
on government budgets; to market participants, this meant that
some countries’ government bonds had an increased default
risk. In addition, liquidity considerations played an increasing
role in the financial crisis. Ultimately, the financial crisis may also
have adversely affected the risk propensity of market partici-
pants, thus in turn causing an increase in risk premiums.
A recently published Deutsche Bundesbank discussion paper
analyses ways of quantifying the aforementioned elements of
sovereign bond spreads in the euro area.1By decomposing the
spreads into the three specified components, it is possible to
determine the probability of default expected in the market
while excluding variations in the liquidity and risk premiums.
The study applies an econometric approach which was originally
developed in the empirical literature on exchange-rate target
zones.2This is possible insofar as, in terms of the model, it makes
no difference to the investor whether his claims are devalued by
means of a default or a depreciation in the exchange rate,
depending on whether the bonds in question are denominated
in local or foreign currency.3
In the study, the spread between a bond issued by country jand
a Bund ( DE) at time tis determined using an estimation equation
which models the three specified components,
ijt/C0iDE;t¼/C11/C25jtþ/C13/C21jtþ/C14hjtþ"jt, (1)
where /C25denotes the probability of default, /C21is a liquidity meas-
ure, ha measure of the risk of unexpected losses, "the residual
of the equation and /C11; /C13and /C14the parameters to be estimated,
of which /C11can be interpreted as the default rate. The variable h
is modelled as a modified GARCH-in-mean process, in other
words as a conditional variance of the residuals ", since an
increasing conditional variance heightens the risk of an invest-
ment.4
Liquidity is approximated using a number of different variables.
Among other options, the spread between ten-year Bunds andgovernment-guaranteed bonds with matching maturities issued
by KfW Bankengruppe has proved to be a suitable measure and
is therefore used for the baseline results presented here. The
government guarantee ensures that both bonds are indistin-
guishable from one another in terms of the credit risk involved
while at the same time the liquidity of the Bunds is noticeably
higher owing to the larger market volume. This widely-used
liquidity measure focuses on the euro-area bond market as a
whole and, as such, is not country-specific, /C21jt¼/C21t, which is why
country-specific parameters /C13jare estimated.
The term /C11/C25jtrepresents the losses expected by the market due
to a possible default expressed as an expected value. While the
default rate /C11is estimated as a fixed parameter, the probability
of default /C25jtis determined conditional on a vector of exogenous
variables zjt. By using a probit transformation, ie the normal dis-
tribution function /C8, values of /C25jtthat lie in the interval of zero

The vector of the variables influencing the probability of default
contains several variables. First, use is made of the spread be-
tween BBB-rated corporate bonds and euro-area government
bonds. This variable, in and of itself, reflects the financing condi-
tions for enterprises; in the estimation, however, it is used as a
crisis indicator reflecting tensions in the European financial
markets.5As with the liquidity measure described above, it is uni-
form for all euro-area countries, implying that country-specific
parameters /C121jare estimated. Second, vector zjtincludes a
variable that reflects the relative earnings outlook of the finan-
cial sector. It is constructed as the ratio of the equity index for
each country’s financial sector and the corresponding index
value across all sectors (parameter /C122). Third, use was made of a
price competitiveness indicator, the influence of which is repre-
sented by /C123. Particularly in the wake of the crisis, unfavourable
price competitiveness has been associated with limited prospects
for growth.6The literature has also expressed the notion that
vulnerability to the financial crisis increased in proportion to a
country’s decreasing competitiveness.7Fourth, for the reason
stated above, in some of the specifications /C124was used to calcu-
late the effect of an interaction between the competitiveness
indicator and the financial crisis indicator on the probability of
default.

5Alternatively, use could have been made of the first factor of a
principal component analysis described on p 35. However, such a
factor needs to be interpreted more narrowly as an indicator of risk
appetite. The spread of corporate bonds in Europe used here differs
from the indicator used in the box on pp 36-37 as a global risk factor
only inasmuch as the latter uses comparable US bonds. — 6As low
competitiveness impacts negatively on the ability of a country to re-

33The equation system was estimated using daily data for the ten-
year bond spreads of ten euro-area countries over comparableGerman Bunds, inter alia for the period between the rescue of
the US bank Bear Stearns in mid-March 2008 and the end of April2009.
8The middle column of the table below shows the relevant
estimates, according to which all variables affect the interestrate spread with the expected sign and are statistically signifi-cant. According to /C14, for example, an increase in the estimated
conditional variance hresults in a growing yield spread. A similar
effect is induced by an increasing liquidity premium (see /C13).
According to this estimate, the default rate /C11is relatively low, at
16%. If the above-mentioned interaction term is left out of theequation, however, this delivers a default rate of 43%.
Widening spreads over corporate bonds and increasing difficul-
ties in the financial sector of a country, in the markets’ view, leadto a growing probability of default ( /C12
1and /C122). According to /C123,
a similar situation arises when price competitiveness declines.Finally, as the estimate for /C12
4demonstrates, sensitivity to the
escalation of the financial market crisis situation increases inproportion to the decline in competitiveness exhibited by theeconomy concerned.
Decomposing the spreads of individual countries into the three
components shows that, during the first year of the crisis, theobservation period of the discussion paper, the increase in
spreads over Bunds was largely attributable to an increase in theprobability of default expected by the market, especially in thosecountries with wide interest rate spreads. That said, particularlyin the Netherlands and Austria, whose yield spreads over Bundsalso rose somewhat in this period, an increase in the riskpremium was also of great importance. The estimates couldtherefore be a sign of speculative pressure in these countries.Lastly, the results suggest that liquidity factors played acomparatively important role for the price losses experienced bybonds from Finland, France and Portugal.
There are several particular aspects which make it difficult to
apply the approach to current developments in the Europeangovernment bond markets. One is that euro-area spreadshave risen further, reaching exceptionally high levels, andin some euro-area member states the financial and economiccrisis has been compounded by a debt crisis. However, in particu-lar, it must be borne in mind that ever since the Eurosystem’sSecurities Markets Programme (SMP) began, spreads in the euroarea have no longer reflected solely the perceptions of existingmarket participants and are therefore likely to have a downwardbias.
If the aforementioned reservations are ignored and the ap-
proach estimated for the period between the end of July 2009and the beginning of May 2011, this produces the coefficientslisted in the right-hand column of the table. Since a liquiditymeasure covering the euro area as a whole, such as the initiallyapplied KfW spread, appears unsuitable for countries suffering adebt crisis, a country-specific liquidity measure, namely bid-askspreads, is used instead.
13Once again, the coefficients prove
significant and plausible in terms of their sign. Corporate bondspreads, however, have lately lost some of their explanatorypower with regard to sovereign spreads. This is because theyhave narrowed in line with the favourable economic develop-ments seen in several major euro-area countries while sovereignbond spreads have continued to widen, particularly in the caseof smaller euro-area member states with debt problems.According to the estimates, the importance of risk premiums forcountries such as Greece and Portugal has grown considerablysince the second quarter of 2010.

34holding, guarantees or the setting up of bad
banks. For this reason, the soundness and
outlook of the financial sector have increas-
ingly become the focus of investors’ atten-
tion. For example, the announcement by the
Governing Council of the ECB of unconven-
tional monetary policy measures in May 2009
and the publication by the USA of the results
of a bank stress test appeared to quell market
participants’ concerns about the banking sec-tor, which was initially reflected in decreasing
yield spreads on euro-area sovereign bonds.
However, the example of Ireland shows that
problems in the banking system can have dir-
ect and more extreme repercussions on pub-
lic budgets. When it became apparent in the
third quarter of 2010 that the fragile Irish
banking sector was in need of further govern-
ment support – which would have consider-
ably strained public finances – Irish yield
spreads widened drastically. This develop-
ment continued in the fourth quarter of 2010
and resulted in the Irish government taking
recourse to the EU/IMF rescue package in No-
vember 2010. Empirical studies also suggest
a link between the situation in the banking
sector and euro-area yield spreads. According
to these studies, yield spreads tend to in-
crease particularly strongly in countries with
large banking sectors and relatively low cap-
ital ratios (see box on pages 36-37).
Furthermore, the financial crisis has caused
the attention of market participants to fall on
external imbalances in the euro area and the
danger of inflows of external capital abruptly
drying up. The euro-area peripheral countries
in some cases used to, and still do, rely heav-
ily on capital imports in order to finance their
current account deficits. Before the outbreak
of the financial crisis, given a low-interest rate
environment and thus favourable financing
conditions, these capital imports had in-
creased, in some cases considerably. At the
same time, price competitiveness, too, de-
creased in some euro-area member states,
which is likely to have intensified the sensitiv-Ratings of Greece, Ireland

The influence current account deficits and
low competitiveness exert on yield spreadsin the euro area can also be demonstratedempirically (see, for instance, the box onpages 32-33).
When quantifying the creditworthiness of
government debt securities, many marketparticipants take the assessment of ratingagencies into account. Some institutional in-vestors, such as pension funds or insurers, areobliged by law or their own statutes to onlypurchase and hold bonds with a certain min-imum rating. One widely known minimumrating is “investment grade” (S&P: at leastBBB-, Moody’s: at least Baa3). For a countrywhich has been downgraded, or is expectinga downgrade, to sub-investment grade, sig-nificant portfolio shifts can be assumed. Since2007, several euro-area member states havebeen downgraded; Greek bonds have losttheir investment-grade status.
A downgrade – or even an increased likeli-
hood of this, as it is expressed by the term“negative outlook” in the ratings supple-ment – also represents an important indicatorfor investors which are not bound by ratingsas they indicate possible tensions on the mar-ket for government bonds. For instance,when Ireland, Portugal, Greece and Spainwere downgraded to varying degrees in thefirst quarter of 2011, it is likely that this aloneincreased the pressure on prices. However,ratings do not ideally reflect short-term influ-ences, which means that they are not appro-priate near-term measures of credit risk inmany cases.
6Risk premium
From a risk-averse investor’s point of view,
the risk premium is a compensation for theuncertainty about whether, when the bondmatures, unexpected losses could emergealongside the already expected losses; or – inthe case of a shorter investment horizon – acompensation for higher fluctuations com-pared to a benchmark bond throughout thelifetime. The size of the risk premium is there-fore determined by the extent of uncertaintyand risk aversion.
It is often difficult to interpret individual indi-
cators of risk appetite as they are also affect-ed by a number of other factors that are un-related to risk appetite. Therefore, aggregatedindicators, which are made up of several indi-vidual indicators, are often used for this pur-pose. This can be exemplified by an analysiswhich includes the following individual indi-cators: the volatility index VDAX, the time-varying correlation between the returns onGerman government bonds and shares, inter-est rate spreads of AAA-rated corporatebonds, interest rate spreads of BBB-rated cor-porate bonds over Bunds, credit default risk
5Mody (2009), for instance, underlines that the relation-

spreads was particularly pronounced in countries with a

36Deutsche BundesbankThe impact of the banking sector on euro-area yield spreads
The fact that the banking sector has played a major
role in the financial crisis over the past few years has
raised the question as to what extent the state of a
country’s banking system has an impact on its sover-
eign bond yields. The very fact that using govern-
ment funds to support the financial sector could, at
least potentially, present a considerable fiscal bur-
den for the future, which, in turn, should be reflect-
ed in a government’s financing conditions suggests
that such a relationship does exist.
A study which examines this relationship for euro-
area countries uses the following estimation equa-
tion:1
ðij/C0iDEÞt¼/C26jðij/C0iDEÞt/C01þ/C13/C28jtþ/C121jztþ/C122j/C21jtþ
/C123jdjtþ/C124jztdjtþujt
where ðij/C0iDEÞtdenotes the yield spread between
the bonds of country jand Bunds at time t. Bonds
with a maturity of around ten years are used. The
yield spread ðij/C0iDEÞt/C01, which is lagged by one
period, is included as an explanatory variable in
order to take account of the persistence of yield
spreads; the parameter /C26jreflects autocorrelation.
The variable ztrepresents a global risk factor, which
plays a very significant role in explaining the vari-
ance of the yield spreads. The yield spread between
US corporate bonds with a BBB rating and US gov-
ernment bonds is used in the estimation as a proxy
variable for this global risk factor.2In the estimation,
the liquidity of bonds of country jrelative to Bunds
is incorporated as /C21jt. The bid-ask spread of a given
country j’s bonds serves as a measure of that coun-
try’s liquidity.3
The variable djt, which has been left out in the initial
specification A, represents alternative banking sec-tor-specific determinants. In specification B, for ex-
ample, this is the aggregate balance sheet of the
banking sector from country jin relation to its GDP,
and for specification C, the average equity ratio of
banks. In the case of both variables, the corres-
ponding value for Germany is subtracted in the
same way as for the endogenous variable. Whereas
/C123depicts the direct impact of the banking sector on
the yield spread, /C124measures the effect of the inter-
action between the banking sector and the global
risk factor. The disturbance term ujtcompletes the
equation.
In order to avoid potential statistical inconsistencies
in the results, Swamy’s panel estimation procedure
was used; this procedure determines country-specific
parameters which share a common probability distri-
bution.4The following table provides an overview of
weighted averages of the parameters calculated
using the Swamy procedure.
Positive autocorrelation plays an important role in
determining interest rate spreads (coefficient /C26). Ac-

37cording to /C122, a higher bid-ask spread also signifi-
cantly contributes towards increasing the yield
spread over Bunds. This suggests that interest rate
spreads of Bunds are also influenced by liquidity ef-
fects in the euro area. According to the estimation,
however, the influence of the global risk factor is
much more significant from an economic perspec-
tive: an increase in global uncertainty – measured in
terms of interest rate spreads between corporate
and government bonds in the USA – results in grow-
ing yield spreads between euro-area sovereign
bonds.
In specification B, the size of the banking sector
in relation to GDP is also taken into consideration.
Its influence is significant both in economic and
statistical terms. The direct effect of the size of the
banking system on sovereign spreads is negative
(coefficient /C123B). Economies with a comparatively
large banking sector therefore have relatively small
yields. This is plausible insofar as a large banking
sector is a source of government revenue and can
bolster economic growth. Furthermore, banks also
generally act as investors on the sovereign bond
market, which could have a negative impact on their
yields.
However, the significantly positive coefficient /C124B
shows that this only applies in times when global
risks are deemed to be low. If global risks increase,
the advantages of an economy with a large banking
system decrease. Thus, beyond a certain threshold
– in this case an interest rate spread between corpor-
ate and sovereign bonds of around 200 basis points –
a larger banking sector becomes a burden as it be-
gins to drive up sovereign yields rather than redu-
cing them. The countries concerned are therefore
more susceptible to fluctuations in the global riskfactor than other countries. In the case of Ireland,
the country with the largest banking sector among
the various states considered (measured in terms of
GDP), this factor, according to the estimation, con-
tributed up to 80 basis points to the yield spreads
observed during the period under review, which ex-
panded to 270 at their peak.
In addition to the size of its banking sector, the
banking sector’s resilience also has an impact on the
yields of government bonds. Whereas the former of
the two variables provides, above all, information
about the potential costs of a possible government
bail-out, the latter relates, in particular, to the likeli-
hood of such a rescue operation taking place. Speci-
fication C shows that such considerations actually
have a significant impact on euro-area yield spreads:
the higher the capital ratio of the banking sector,
the lower the yield spreads of the country concerned
in times of economic uncertainty.
In summary, it may therefore be stated that, accord-
ing to the estimations, the banking sector has a sig-
nificant impact on sovereign yield spreads in the
euro area. The interaction with a global risk factor
plays a crucial role in this: in countries with large
banking sectors and lower bank equity ratios, an in-
crease in aggregate risk causes interest rate spreads
to widen more sharply. This is because a rise in
global risk makes it more likely that a country will
need to draw on relatively large amounts of state
aid, which, in turn, could have a negative impact on
public finances.

grade credit default risk premiums (Itraxx
Crossover). The principal components analysis
method can better segregate risk aversion,
which is reflected in all variables, from other
specific influences than if only a single indica-
tor were considered individually.7The results show that the turmoil on the fi-
nancial markets after Lehman Brothers went
bankrupt in September 2008 was accompan-
ied by a sudden increase in general risk aver-
sion. The change in risk appetite caused yield
spreads over Bunds to increase in some euro-
area peripheral countries. However, com-
pared with the much higher risk aversion in
the financial markets overall, the increase ini-
tially remained moderate.
Amidst concerns over the stability of the fi-
nancial system in autumn 2008, many euro-
area member states adopted support meas-
ures for banks, which comprised both gov-
ernment capital assistance and guarantees.
These support packages implied a transfer of
risk from the financial sector to the sover-
eign.8These packages are likely to have fed
the general risk aversion, which had reached
a record level in April 2009 before gradually
receding to a level similar to that before the
Lehman Brothers collapse at the turn of the
year 2009-10. By contrast, market partici-
pants shifted their focus towards the credit-
worthiness of some euro-area peripheral
countries in particular and at the beginning
of 2010 Greek, Irish and Portuguese spreads
rose sharply despite a decrease in general risk
aversion.Yield spreads and risk aversion

39This disengagement of yield spreads in the
above-mentioned countries from the overallrisk appetite suggests the relevance of otherdeterminants, such as the country-specificdefault risk, which could have an extremelystrong influence on yield spreads in times ofcrisis. After the support package for Greece,overall risk aversion increased again at the be-ginning of May 2010. In this environment thegroup of countries which had been classifiedas being more prone to “contagion” fromthe decrease in value of Greek bonds grewnoticeably. Investors’ concerns about suchcontagion effects, which also led to increas-ing liquidity premiums, reflected the closeinterconnectedness of the markets for euro-area government bonds. Yet the EU-IMF res-cue package then considerably helped con-tain the risk of contagion. Similarly, there wasa gradual decline in risk aversion at the sametime. Risk aversion is likely to have had atleast a temporary effect on the risk premiumsof euro-area peripheral countries’ bonds,however.
Safe haven effectsThe yield of ten-year Bunds, which had still
been at 4.7% in mid-2007, decreased mark-edly in the wake of the financial and sover-eign debt crisis; by the end of August 2010yields had reached a historical low of justover 2%. This development can partially beexplained by safe haven flows, ie investorsshifting their capital away from risky invest-ments to Bunds, which are considered safeand liquid. Especially in times of strongly in-creasing overall risk aversion, as was the casein autumn 2008 and in May 2010, investors’demand for Bunds was high, which caused
their yields to drop.
9
Yields of Bunds, which have climbed byaround 80 basis points since September tojust under 3% as this report went to press, in-dicate that safe haven flows have becomeless important although they rose againslightly in connection with the increased un-certainty about Greece’s creditworthiness.Also, the strong recovery of the Germaneconomy has led to higher returns. Further-more, it cannot be ruled out that the increasein yields is a reflection of Germany’s elevatedfinancial burden.
Liquidity premiumsThe markets for government bonds have al-
ways had varying levels of liquidity. An entire-ly liquid market is characterised by marketparticipants being able to buy and sell secur-ities at the equilibrium price in large quan-tities and at all times. High liquidity manifestsitself in low bid-ask spreads, little movementin prices even after large-scale transactionsand possibly a swift return of prices to theequilibrium price after potential deviationsfrom this.
10A security’s expected present and
future liquidity as well as the investors’ time-varying liquidity preferences are the essentialfactors which affect the liquidity premium de-manded by investors.

40Several indicators suggest that the liquidity
premiums of some euro-area government
bonds have increased, in some cases consid-
erably, in the wake of the financial and sover-
eign debt crisis. While the bid-ask spreads of
Bunds have had low values of around five
basis points and have remained constant for
the most part, the already higher spreads of,
for instance, Portuguese and Irish sovereign
yields have widened noticeably since 2008 (to
around 85 basis points and 90 basis points re-
spectively on average over 2010). In addition,
trading of some government bonds issued by
euro-area peripheral countries has weakened
noticeably, especially since May 2010. On
balance, existing liquidity differences have
further intensified. Furthermore, the value at-
tributed to liquid assets by investors increased
considerably during the financial crisis, which
has likewise had an effect on liquidity pre-
miums.11An indicator for this is the yield
spread of bonds issued by the Reconstruction
Loan Corporation (Kreditanstalt für Wieder-
aufbau or KfW) over Bunds, which have iden-
tical default risk but differ in terms of liquid-
ity.12During the financial crisis, this spread
climbed from around ten basis points to peak
at 110 basis points; even as this report went

points, still stood above pre-crisis levels. Em-
pirical studies show that the contribution of
the liquidity premium to explaining the yields
of euro-area sovereign bonds varies consider-
ably. Even though its exact size cannot be de-
termined, it is likely to play an important role
for some countries’ bonds (see box on
page 33).Assessing the determinants and further
outlook
Econometric estimations show that – on the
basis of the decomposition of yield spreads
into their individual components presented
here – the strong widening of spreads in
some euro-area peripheral countries can be
attributed to an elevated credit risk which is
linked to a higher expected loss of an invest-
ment in government bonds (see box on
page 33). Reasons behind this development
are country-specific macroeconomic funda-
mentals such as the debt ratio and the
budget deficit, the current account balance,
price competitiveness and the soundness of
the financial sector. The financial sector occu-
pies a particularly important place in Ireland,
where comprehensive public aid for financial
institutions implies a massive transfer of risk
to the sovereign, placing a considerable bur-
den on its creditworthiness.
In the wake of the financial and sovereign
debt crisis, financial market participants have
been increasingly sceptical of some countries’
public debt sustainability. The at times abrupt
and massive revaluations can also be ex-
plained by the nonlinear relationship between
the credit risk and the aforementioned funda-
mentals. Firstly, there could be a type of
threshold value with regard to fundamentals
such as the debt ratio where – once sur-
passed – the markets are especially critical of

41any further increase.13Secondly, there are
signs suggesting that a certain combinationof weak fundamentals – eg low price com-petitiveness alongside an ailing financial sec-tor, or a large banking sector in times of eco-nomic uncertainty – have their own positiveimpact on yield spreads.
In comparison with the financial crisis, during
which shares and corporate bonds had comeunder enormous pressure due to a strong in-crease in risk aversion, risk appetite played aless significant role during the sovereign debtcrisis. However, increased overall risk aversionalso contributed to the widening of thespreads. This was particularly true in May2010, when risk aversion temporarily attaineda relatively elevated level. Depending on thecountry, the power of liquidity premiums toexplain yield spreads varies. Overall, however,the results indicate that euro-area yieldspreads are mainly based on fundamentalsand cannot be attributed to exaggerated riskaversion or liquidity premiums.
The central role of weak fundamentals for
high yield spreads in the euro area since theonset of the sovereign debt crisis demon-strates the need for strict budgetary disciplinethroughout the euro area. Additionally, im-portant structural reforms need to be imple-mented particularly in the peripheral coun-tries in order to create long-term prerequis-ites for higher growth, an improved currentaccount and consequently reduced depend-ency on capital imports, stronger competi-tiveness as well as a sound financial sector.However, it is to be expected that, even afterthe necessary reform measures have beentaken, some euro-area sovereign spreads will
remain at a higher level than in the first fewyears of the monetary union. The wide dis-persion between individual countries is alsolikely to persist.
This seems appropriate as risks connected to
financial investments were often understated,causing market participants to raise their riskawareness. In addition, market participants’experience of liquidity risks occurring in amore comprehensive and abrupt mannerthan previously assumed, is likely to be re-flected in persistently higher liquidity pre-miums and in greater liquidity spreads be-tween euro-area sovereigns.
Another important factor for future yield
spreads is also the development of economicfundamentals, which can only gradually beadapted in some cases. Improving competi-tiveness within the monetary union, for ex-ample, requires a long period of low inflation,which in turn calls for wage restraint, greaterlabour market flexibility and increasing labourproductivity. In the short term, this could rep-resent a burden on the economy and on taxrevenue; it is, however, necessary if the forcesof growth are to be strengthened in the long-term. Added to this is the fact that it is gener-ally difficult to assess the future burdensemerging from government support meas-ures for financial institutions.

42Deuts che Bun desbankRelationship between yiel d sprea ds an d CDS premiums
There is generally a very close ar bitra ge relationship 
between soverei gn bond yiel ds an d the premium for credit 
default swap ( CDS) contra cts.1 This is because they both 
express inter alia  the risk of default of the bond issuer 
and the risk aversion of the market parti cipants. Here, it is 
generally assume d that, all other thin gs bein g equal, the 
higher the yiel d of a se curity, the greater the risk per ceive d 
by market parti cipants that a debtor will be una ble to meet 
his payment o bligations. The pri cing relationship between 
soverei gn bonds an d CDS markets became more relaxe d 
durin g the ﬁ  nan cial crisis an d even more so durin g the sov-
erei gn debt crisis. The followin g text explains how ar bitra ge 
occurs un der normal market conditions an d then moves on 
to discuss the reasons for this relationship becomin g more 
relaxe d. The relationship between CDS an d bond markets 
turns out to be no lon ger quite so closely couple d, espe cially 
in the case of bonds issue d by those countries at the centre 
of the soverei gn debt crisis. This was the result not only of 
liquidity premiums but also the ﬁ  nan cing costs of ar bitra ge 
positions, whi ch in crease in times of crisis. The intervention 
of the Eurosystem in the bond market un der the Securities 
Markets Pro gramme ( SMP) mi ght have temporarily le d to 
anomalies in some markets.
Both bonds an d CDS contra cts on these bonds generally 
carry the same credit risk.2 Simple ar bitra ge lo gic therefore 
suggests that there is a close relationship between yiel d 
sprea ds an d CDS premiums, as the hair cut on a bond with a 
default risk compare d with a safe se curity shoul d just sufﬁ  ce 
to cover the CDS insuran ce premium. This is because the 
portfolio com bination of hi gher-interest- bearin g bonds an d 
CDS contra cts is risk-free an d shoul d therefore generate the 
same return as a se curity whi ch is risk-free from the outset. 
If pri ce movements create a su bstantial gap between the 
interest rate premium an d the CDS premium, this provi des 
tra ders on a perfe ct market with the opportunity to skim 
the market for risk-free proﬁ  ts. Such transa ctions ten d to 
result in the pri ces of soverei gn bonds an d CDS constantly 
movin g towar ds a state of ar bitra ge e quili brium in whi ch 
it is not possi ble to make a proﬁ  t without takin g risks. As 
a rule, the CDS markets hol d the pri ce lea dership position 
durin g the a djustment pro cess.3
In pra ctice, tra ders ten d to calculate the so- calle d basis in 
order to be a ble to quickly i dentify any ar bitra ge opportun-
ities that o ccur in the short term “at the e dge of e quili b-
rium”. This is the differen ce between CDS an d bond sprea ds 
with mat chin g maturities, whi ch is expresse d in basis points. 
As a rule of thum b, the proﬁ  ta bility of the tra ding position increases with the differen ce (positive or ne gative) between 
the two varia bles. In a perfe ct market, the basis shoul d be 
completely eliminate d in the lon g term throu gh tra ding 
activity. In reality, however, a num ber of fa ctors drive a 
we dge between these closely linke d varia bles; the resultin g 
gap therefore cannot always be plu gged by tra ding.
The fa ct that tra ders have different metho ds of calculatin g 
the basis – depen ding on the inten ded purpose – plays 
an important role in this. For example, depen ding on the 
mo del use d, the calculation of the interest rate sprea d of 
the bonds, in parti cular, can be a rather complex pro cess.4 
However, a good ﬁ rst insi ght can be o btaine d if the bond 
sprea d is rou ghly calculate d as the interest rate sprea d over 
the benchmark bond. In the context of the euro area, the 
basis therefore often contains the yiel d sprea d of ten-year 
bonds of a country over the latest issues of ten-year Bun ds, 
as explaine d in the main body of this arti cle.
The respe ctive li quidity premiums of the bonds are an 
additional decisive determinant of the level of the basis. 
Parti cularly the often tense situation on the markets over 
the past few years has meant that the relative li quidity of 
the instruments has become in creasin gly important. Given 
that Bun ds are the most li quid interest- bearin g market 
instrument in the euro area, the market tensions over the 
crisis years have meant that the basis is ten ding to become 
increasin gly ne gative. The hi gh level of li quidity of Bun ds, 
together with the declinin g liquidity of soverei gn bonds in 
other euro-area countries, have conse quently driven up the 
yiel d sprea ds. The CDS premiums did not completely follow 
suit.
The ﬁ  nan cing costs of tra ding transa ctions are a further 
factor whi ch have a similar effe ct. Finan cial institutions 
generally use bank-spe ciﬁ c ﬁ nan cing rates as the base for 
their calculations. In times of crisis with hi gh institution-
spe ciﬁ c risk premiums, banks expose d to hi gher credit risk 
have an in centive to assume the role of the prote ction seller 
by en gaging in a CDS contra ct rather than the e quivalent 
position (viewe d from a credit risk perspe ctive), whi ch 
involves o btainin g fun ds (at hi gher rates owin g to the risk 
premiums) an d pur chasin g risky bonds. This effe ct can be 
ma gniﬁ ed by the fa ct that the quality of risky bonds use d 
as collateral decreases in times of crisis an d higher hair cuts 
are therefore applie d on the repo markets. In relative terms, 
the cost of a bond with a hi gher risk of default therefore 
declines owin g to the la ck of deman d on the bond market, 
with the result that the bond sprea d in creases, while the

these fa ctors contri bute towar ds the basis movin g into 
negative territory.
In a ddition to these market pri ce fa ctors, the level of the 
basis is also inﬂ  uen ced by contra ct-spe ciﬁ c varia bles. The 
basis can conse quently fall below zero, for example, as the 
CDS prote ction buyer is not usually covere d against the loss 
of coupon payments in the event of a default. The we dge 
increases as the coupon payment date approa ches an d the 
coupon amount to be pai d increases.
However, there are also fa ctors whi ch tip the s cales in the 
other direction an d contri bute towar ds the basis movin g 
into positive territory. For example, the prote ction seller 
usually issues CDS contra cts with a “ cheapest to deliver” 
(CTD) option, whi ch, in the case of a credit event, gives the 
prote ction buyer the ri ght to deliver the bond whi ch is the 
most favoura ble for him. The prote ction seller deman ds 
a premium for this option, whi ch wi dens the CDS sprea d 
in relation to the yiel d sprea d, whi ch is base d on spe ciﬁ c 
bonds. Furthermore, there are a num ber of other fa ctors 
whi ch have to be taken into consi deration when tra ding 
usin g the basis.5 
Regulatory responses to the soverei gn debt crisis an d 
Eurosystem interventions in the ﬁ  nan cial markets mi ght also have ha d an impa ct on the basis. It was, however, evi dent 
durin g the crisis that in the case of Gree ce, for example, 
the differen ce between CDS premiums an d bond yiel ds, 
whi ch is generally ne gative, experien ced a temporary shift 
in si gns durin g the course of the measures that were taken 
and rea ched an ex ceptionally positive level. The Eurosystem 
interventions un der the SMP may also have playe d a si g-
niﬁ cant role in the development of the basis, when pu blic 
market parti cipants restri cted their a ctivity to the pur chas-
ing of bonds. By doin g so, the support pur chases coul d 
have pushe d up the pri ce for bonds from in dividual ailin g

45Extended MFI interest rate statistics:
methodology and first results
The recently completed overhaul of the MFI interest rate statistics introduces a number of add-
itional subcategories for new lending business which significantly expand the database and open
up new analytical possibilities. The additional information not only allows a more comprehensive
study of the monetary transmission mechanism and the convergence of financial markets but
also provides new insights into aspects of risk that are relevant to the analysis of financial
stability.
Having undergone extensive checking to assure their quality, the data collected since mid-2010
under the new approach are to be published for the first time in June 2011. This article explains
the methodological changes in the MFI interest rate statistics and outlines the analytical benefits
of the additional categories. It also presents first results for the most recent reporting period
based on the new data.
When the ECB Regulation was revised, the sampling procedure and selection of the banks that
are required to report for the MFI interest rate statistics were also modified. To minimise the
reporting burden on the banking sector, the MFI interest rate statistics in Germany are still not
based on a full census. However, to ensure that the sample remains representative over time, it
needs to be reviewed on a regular basis and, where appropriate, additional banks must be
required to report. This article outlines the criteria used for the overhaul and the resulting
changes to the sample.
Finally, we look at how the data collected for the MFI interest rate statistics are used in economic
analysis, taking the monetary transmission mechanism as an example. In this context, we also
discuss the conclusions that can be drawn about the structure of lending business in Germany on
the basis of the new data.

46MFI interest rate statistics since 2003
Since they were introduced in January 2003,
the harmonised MFI interest rate statistics
have provided the Eurosystem with valuable
information for analysing monetary develop-
ments and the monetary transmission mech-
anism as well as for monitoring financial sta-
bility.1The national contributions to these
statistics are collected by all central banks in
the European System of Central Banks (ESCB)
on a monthly basis.2The German contribu-
tion to the MFI interest rate statistics com-
prises the interest rates that resident monet-
ary financial institutions apply to – and their
business volumes of – euro-denominated
deposits of and loans to households and non-
financial corporations domiciled in the euro
area. The Bundesbank collects data both on
new business in the reporting month and on
outstanding amounts, ie the value of all con-
tracts existing at the end of the month. The
national contributions to the MFI interest rate
statistics form the basis for calculating the
euro-area’s interest rate aggregates, which in
turn provide the Governing Council of the
ECB with key information for its decisions
regarding the monetary policy stance.
When the interest rate statistics regulation
and the regulation concerning statistics on
the consolidated balance sheet of the MFI
sector were adopted in 2001, it was decided
that the approach to monetary statistics with-
in the ESCB would remain unchanged for a
period of at least five years in order to limit
the reporting institutions’ changeover costs
and safeguard the stability and continuity of
the data. To ensure that the informativevalue of the monetary statistics remains high
in years to come, additional data require-
ments, such as those made necessary by new
developments on the credit market, have
been devised over the past few years. In add-
ition, the reworking was intended as a means
of aligning the methods for collecting statis-
tics even more closely with each other. A
comprehensive Europe-wide merits and costs
analysis was conducted in order to evaluate
the required adjustments. Those require-
ments which were found to be urgently ne-
cessary were brought together in a joint
package consisting of three statistics regula-
tions, which was subsequently adopted by
the Governing Council of the ECB. This pack-
age comprises the amending regulation on
MFI interest rate statistics,3the revised regu-
lation on MFI balance sheet statistics4and the
regulation concerning statistics on financial
vehicle corporations.5

ning more than one year, the new interest

These data subsequently underwent in-depth

Methodological changes from 2010
The overhaul entailed a number of changes in
the recording of new business in the MFI
interest rate statistics. New types of lending
were incorporated into the data, loans to
non-financial corporations were broken
down further by volume and period of inter-
est rate fixation, and additional items for re-
cording secured loans separately were intro-
duced. We will look at each of these changes
individually in the following paragraphs.
In recent years, credit card debt has become
considerably more important in the euro area
and has come under increasing analytical
scrutiny in the wake of the financial crisis.
The overhaul of the MFI interest rate statistics
therefore established individual categories for
this type of lending so that it can be analysed
separately. In addition, the overhaul draws a
distinction between “convenience credit card
debt”, for which no interest accrues during
the payment period, and “extended credit
card debt”. For the latter, interest is usually
charged once the payments of a billing cycle
become due if the customer’s debit amounts
have not yet been settled. Only the interest
rates on extended credit card debt to house-
holds and non-financial corporations are re-
corded in the MFI interest rate statistics,
whilst the corresponding business volumes
for extended and convenience credit carddebt are recorded in the monthly balance
sheet statistics.
Recording credit card debt separately in-
creases homogeneity in the individual interest
rate categories. Previously, credit card debt
was often reported together with overdrafts,
with no distinction drawn between the two
types of lending, despite the fact that they
can differ substantially from each other in
terms of their interest rates and their signifi-
cance in the individual euro-area countries.
The new data make it possible to monitor the
interest rates on this type of lending more
closely, allowing, for example, conclusions to
be drawn about the level of household debt
and thus also about aspects of financial sta-
bility.6
As well as recording credit card debt separ-
ately, the overhauled MFI interest rate statis-
tics also contain a clearer definition of over-
drafts, thus allowing this item to be further
harmonised within the euro area.7This cat-
egory is now entitled “revolving loans and
overdrafts”.8The data recorded under this
item provide important information for both
6Extended credit card debt to non-financial corporations
plays a fairly minor role in Germany and is therefore not
shown separately.
7Previously, only the MFI interest rate statistics recorded
the instrument category “overdrafts” separately. The
monthly balance sheet statistics now also show these vol-
umes separately in order to make the two statistical sys-
tems more consistent with one another.
8In Regulation ECB/2008/32 concerning the balance
sheet of the monetary financial institutions sector, over-
drafts are defined as debit balances on current accounts.
By contrast, revolving loans are loans that have all the fol-
lowing features: (1) the borrower may use or withdraw
funds up to a pre-approved credit limit without giving
prior notice to the lender; (2) the amount of available
credit can increase and decrease as funds are borrowed
and repaid; (3) the credit may be used repeatedly;
(4) there is no obligation for regular repayment of funds.Additional

48financial stability policy and monetary policy,
as bank customers can still use these forms of
lending even if they cannot obtain any other
loans owing either to liquidity shortages or li-
quidity hoarding by banks. Increasing use of
revolving loans and overdrafts can thus be a
sign of financing constraints in the private
sector and/or restrictions at banks.
The data that are now available on revolving
loans and overdrafts as well as on extended
credit card debt illustrate the considerable
differences in the level of interest rates in
these categories. Overdrafts are thus consid-
erably more expensive for households than
for non-financial corporations, for example.
In the reporting period from January 2003 to
April 2011, this difference amounted to an
average of 469 basis points. One reason forthis could be that corporations are subject to
certain reporting obligations, whilst the credit
risk of households is less transparent. Extend-
ed credit card debt to households, which has
only been recorded separately since June
2010, is even more expensive. The average
interest rate on this type of lending was
around 15% per annum.
Sole proprietors9are enterprises without in-
dependent legal status, such as doctors,
architects or lawyers. They were previously in-
cluded indistinguishably in the household sec-
tor of the MFI interest rate statistics, as such
business entities are inseparably linked to
natural persons. Loans to sole proprietors are
often included in “loans for other purposes”
if they cannot be clearly ascribed to any other
category.10Nonetheless, the economic be-
haviour of these market participants can
differ widely from that of the typical house-
hold, and having more homogeneous group-
ings is therefore an advantage for analytical
purposes.
As information on sole proprietors is import-
ant for economic and financial analysis, the
overhauled MFI interest rate statistics contain
a new sub-item for new business in loans to
households for other purposes. Using these
data, it is now possible to examine the differ-
ing developments in credit aggregates be-
tween countries more selectively. In addition,Selected lending rates

49the data on sole proprietors are a good indi-
cator for analysing the financing of smallerenterprises.
In Germany, loans to sole proprietors make
up the bulk of the volume of loans to house-holds for other purposes, with an averageshare of more than 60%. The German datashow that the interest rate conditions for thisgroup are only slightly more expensive thanfor households as a whole (including sole pro-prietors). The interest rate premium thusstood at around five basis points in the short-term interest rate fixation band and at justover 14 basis points in the medium-term fix-ation band. The interest rates in the longer-term fixation band were almost identical onaverage.
The overhaul of the MFI interest rate statistics
involved further changes, in particular, in thearea of loans to enterprises. Loans to non-financial corporations are now broken downfurther by size so as to improve the optionsfor analysing financing conditions for smallerenterprises. The loan volume is considered tobe an indicator of the enterprise’s size.
11
Moreover, loans to enterprises are brokendown further by the initial period of interestrate fixation. This allows the transmission ofkey interest rate changes to be investigated inmore detail and permits new insights into thedifferences in interest rates between coun-tries.

As is to be expected, the new data derivedfrom the more detailed size breakdown showthat, for loans to non-financial corporations,the interest rate is invertly linked to thevolume. Since June 2010, loans up to an
amount of €250,000 were thus granted foran average of around 4.5% per annum,whilst the interest rates on loans over anamount of €250,000 and up to €1 millionwere between 3% and 3.5% per annum.The lowest interest rates were payable onloans over an amount of €1 million, at anaverage of 2.7% per annum. Assuming thatsmall-volume loans tend to be taken out bysmall and medium-sized enterprises, one pos-sible explanation for these differences ininterest rates is the lower transparency ofsmaller enterprises in comparison with largercompanies, which are subject to stricter dis-closure requirements. It is therefore mucheasier to identify risks for large enterprisesthan for, say, sole proprietorships.
The presentation of fully secured loans to
households and non-financial corporations innew business is another important change inthe MFI interest rate statistics. In the new re-porting system, those types of loans whichare deemed to be secured according to thespecified definition are reported separatelyfor all types of lending apart from credit carddebt, revolving loans and overdrafts, andloans for other purposes. For the purposes ofthe MFI interest rate statistics, a loan isdeemed to be secured if the value of theunderlying collateral and/or the guarantees or

12All loan size categories are divided into the following

50sureties is equal to or greater than the total
amount of the loan.13Those loans which are
backed with collateral amounting to at least
their full amount are thus recorded as being
secured. The total item still comprises fully
secured, partially secured and unsecured
loans, although the latter two are not re-
corded separately.
Recording secured loans separately allows
interest rates to be broken down into more
homogeneous risk groups. This improves the
informative value of the statistics here too
and provides analysts with additional infor-
mation on the possible causes of differences
in interest rates. In addition, the data allow
more in-depth analyses of how credit risk in-
fluences the way in which banks structure
their terms and conditions, thus also allowingconclusions to be drawn about borrowers’
financing costs. Furthermore, this information
will be used in the future for the regular
examinations of risks to financial stability.
The data show that only a small part of lend-
ing for consumption is secured to the full
amount of the loan. On average, only up to
10% of such transactions were fully secured
during the survey period. Interest rates on
secured loans during this period were always
some 100 to 200 basis points below the inter-
est rate on total loans for consumption,
which includes both secured and unsecured
loans. By contrast, a significantly larger
amount of lending to households for house
purchase is secured. In the period from June
2010 to April 2011, an average of more than
50% of loans for house purchase were fully
secured. Only the shortest interest rate
fixation band showed a low level of collatera-
lisation. The differences between interest
rates for the total item and those on secured
loans were far smaller for lending for house
purchase than for loans for consumption. For
the secured items, interest rates on loans for
house purchase were, on average, less than
ten basis points below the total item. One
explanation for this could be that most of the
partially secured loans were likewise backed
to a large extent by collateral but not to the
full amount of the loan; consequently, these
loans are not recorded as fully secured lend-
ing in the MFI interest rate statistics but are
nonetheless granted at similar conditions toLending rates in retail

51the fully secured loans given that the differ-
ence in risk is minimal.
In Germany, relatively few loans to non-
financial corporations are fully secured. Thus,
in the reporting period only around 13% of
loans up to an amount of €250,000 were
fully secured. By contrast, around 20% of
loans in the categories “over an amount of
€250,000 and up to €1 million” and “over an
amount of €1 million” were reported as
being secured. Across all size categories,
fewer loans with shorter periods of interest
rate fixation tended to be secured than
medium-term to long-term loans. Comparing
the interest rates of secured items with those
of total items reveals a mixed picture. Whilst
the interest rate conditions for secured loans
up to an amount of €250,000 were cheaper
than those for total loans in this size category,
the opposite was true of loans over an
amount of €250,000 and up to €1 million,
for which the interest rate on secured loans
was higher than that for the total item. Inter-
est rates on secured and unsecured lending
were at almost the same level for loans over
an amount of €1 million. Our analysis showed
that the interest rate level for non-financial
corporations is strongly dependent on the
creditworthiness of the borrower as well as
on the length and intensity of the business
relationship to date (relationship banking). It
is therefore possible that customers with
lower creditworthiness will often face higher
interest rates despite taking out fully secured
loans.Refining the sampling procedure and up-
dating the group of reporting agents
When the new reporting requirements were
introduced in June 2010, the sampling pro-
cedure used in Germany was also revised and
the group of reporting agents updated (see
also box on page 53). Since they were first
collected in 2003, the data for Germany have
been based on a stratified sample; this is an
alternative to a full census. The advantage of
using a sample rather than a full census is
that, all in all, it entails far lower costs for the
banking system, as only a limited number of
institutions from the entire potential report-
ing population are obliged to report. If the
selection of institutions is also representative
of the entire potential reporting population
and the “sampling error” is small enough,Lending rates in corporate

52analysts can obtain sufficiently accurate
estimates of interest rates and the volume of
new business and calculate reliable figures
for the German contribution to the euro-area
aggregate.
However, a sample can become less repre-
sentative over time; institutions may leave the
sample due to closure and new institutions
may join the potential reporting population.
Furthermore, the characteristics of reporting
agents can change, or new developments in
the financial sector may mean that the
sample no longer reflects the structure of the
entire potential reporting population. For this
reason, the interest rate statistics regulation
stipulates that the national central banks
must check the representativity of their sam-
ple on a regular basis and, where appropri-
ate, adjust their sampling procedure or in-
clude new reporting agents.
The overhaul of the interest rate statistics sam-
ple ensures that the reporting burden on the
German banking sector is kept to an absolute
minimum and, at the same time, that there
are primary data of sufficient quality to obtain
the required statistical results. The selection
criterion that only the largest institutions per
stratum – measured by the relevant balance
sheet total – are obliged to report still applies.
This ensures that around 70% of the relevant
business is captured using around 12% of the
potential reporting population, whilst the
majority of banks in Germany remain exempt
from the requirement to report. These
changes have led to a shift in the shares of the
individual categories of banks in the sample.
Notably, the share of savings banks in thesample has declined from 38% to 30%, whilst
that of regional banks and other commercial
banks has risen by seven percentage points.
MFI interest rate statistics:
selected analytical results
The data on banks’ interest rates and busi-
ness volumes vis-à-vis households and non-
financial corporations recorded in the MFI
interest rate statistics are fundamental for the
ECB Governing Council’s information and
decision-making process with regard to mon-
etary policy.14The data play a particularly im-
portant role in the analysis of the monetary
transmission mechanism, which examines the
effect of monetary policy changes on real
and nominal variables. Data on the interest
rates for various types of deposit are also
used to explain the role of portfolio shifts in
the development of monetary aggregates.
These developments are examined in the con-
text of the monetary analysis in order to iden-
tify medium-term risks to price stability at an
early stage. In addition, the data obtained
from the MFI interest rate statistics help in
monitoring financial stability and document
structural changes in the banking system.
Finally, these harmonised statistics can be
used to investigate the extent to which the
process of interest rate formation for bank
loans differs across the individual countries
and the level of progress that has been made
in the convergence of euro-area markets.15In

53Changes to the sampling procedures for the MFI interest rate statistics
The first step in changing the sampling procedures for
the MFI interest rate statistics was to establish whether,on the basis of the current data, the German samplestill fulfils the legal requirements concerning the min-imum national sample size. When the MFI interest ratestatistics were introduced in 2003, only the data fromthe Bundesbank’s survey of lending and deposit rates– the previous statistics collection system, which isbased on a considerably different approach – could beused to determine the size of the sample. To be able toassess how many reporting agents should be includedin the sample, the legal provisions stipulate that theinterest rates on new business on average over all in-strument categories, which are ascertained using thesample and estimated for the entire potential report-ing population, should not deviate from the actual(unknown) value for the entire potential reportingpopulation by more than 10 basis points at a confi-dence level of 90%.
1
In addition to analysing the sample size, the methodfor dividing the entire potential reporting populationinto certain groups (strata) was also assessed.
2When
dividing the institutions into strata, it should generallybe ensured that the sample reflects the specific charac-teristics of the entire potential reporting population.Each stratum should be as homogeneous as possible, iethe business of the MFIs assigned to a particular stra-tum should be similar.
3In the case of the German sam-
ple, having a minimum of 10 institutions in each stra-tum has been shown to produce a sufficiently low levelof intra-stratum variance. Furthermore, there has beena changeover from the “proportional” approach to“optimal” allocation in the method for dividing thesample into individual strata. Under the proportionalapproach, the number of institutions to be drawn foreach stratum was determined in proportion to its rele-vant business volume. The advantage of optimal allo-cation, which has been used since June 2010, is that,given a fixed sample size, a greater number of report-ing institutions are allocated to those strata whichhave a larger variance, thus minimising variance andallowing the estimated value to be calculated moreprecisely.

This methodological change means that the sample
now consists of 17 strata, whereas the original samplein 2003 was divided into 15 strata. This took account ofchanges in individual banks’ business models, whilealso ensuring that the homogeneity criterion would befulfilled. On the basis of the current database of har-monised MFI interest rate statistics and the change inthe allocation procedure, it was established that thesample of reporting agents needs to be enlarged toaround 240 institutions (compared with around 200 inthe original sample) in order to comply with the qual-ity requirements which came into force by virtue of thenew regulation.
1The regulation states that the maximum random error
for interest rates on new business on average over all in-strument categories does not exceed 10 basis points at aconfidence level of 90%. In other words, there is a 90%probability that the estimated interest rate will deviate byno more than 10 basis points from the actual (unknown)value. — 2For a more detailed description of the stratified
sample, see Deutsche Bundesbank, The new MFI interestrate statistics – methodology for collecting the Germandata, Monthly Report, January 2004, pp 45-59. — 3This is
expressed formally in amending Regulation ECB/2009/7 byvirtue of a modification to the definition of homogeneitywithin the individual strata, which states that the strata areconsidered homogeneous if the sum of the intra-stratumvariances of the sample variables is substantially lower thanthe total variance in the entire actual reporting popula-tion.

54the following section, we outline how the
MFI interest rate statistics are used, taking the
analysis of the transmission mechanism and
of the structure of banks’ lending and deposit
business in Germany as an example.
The ECB’s primary objective is to safeguard
price stability within the euro area. As the
central bank is not able to control goods
prices directly, the Governing Council of the
ECB uses the main refinancing rate as a steer-
ing tool in its monetary policy decisions.
Commercial banks with eligible assets can
borrow central bank money at this interest
rate. The causal chain through which a
change in this interest rate – as a monetary
variable – affects other financial and real vari-
ables and ultimately the price level is known
as the monetary transmission mechanism.Shown in simplified terms by means of the
“interest rate channel”, a change in the main
refinancing rate has a direct impact on the
money market, where banks lend to each
other. If the conditions on the money market
change, banks will then adjust their deposit
and lending rates for households and non-
financial corporations, which are monitored
via the MFI interest rate statistics. In response
to these changes in banks’ interest rates,
households and enterprises will in turn adapt
their consumption, saving and investment
decisions, which ultimately affects price struc-
tures and the general price level.
Empirical studies for the euro area have
shown that the interest rate channel normally
plays the most important role in transmitting
monetary policy stimuli to the real economy.Changes in the composition of the MFI interest rate statistics sample

55This seems to be particulary true of Ger-
many.16The main reason for this is that
banks play a key part in the euro-area finan-cial system and therefore have a major influ-ence on the transmission mechanism. A largepart of the empirical literature therefore fo-cuses on analysing the transmission ofchanges in key interest rates to MFIs’ interestrates. Here, the main focus is on identifyingwhether the interest rate pass-through iscomplete, ie whether the bank interest ratesfully replicate the changes in market interestrates and how quickly this transmission takesplace.
The numerous studies on this topic generally
show that changes in the conditions on themoney markets affect banks’ lending rateswith a certain adjustment lag. The extent ofthis interest rate pass-through varies acrossthe various types of bank loan and acrosscountries. Furthermore, the introduction ofthe euro seems to have led to a structuralbreak in the interest rate pass-through pro-cess. A number of analyses using harmoniseddata from the MFI interest rate statistics thusshow that the extent to which banks’ interestrates are adapted to market rates haschanged and that this adjustment has beenmore rapid since the euro was introduced.One reason for the differences across coun-tries could be that older studies (which arein the majority) are based on the non-harmonised interest rates in banks’ businessthat were collected before the MFI interestrate statistics were introduced.
17One newer
study based exclusively on the harmoniseddata from the MFI interest rate statistics con-cludes that the interest rate pass-through inGermany occurs more quickly than shown by
earlier studies and does not differ greatlyfrom the interest rate pass-through in theeuro area as a whole. This finding backs upthe assumption that previous – non-Interest rate spectrum at the

56harmonised – statistics tended to understate
the speed of pass-through. However, it could
also reflect the increase in convergence after
the euro was introduced.18
The structural data recorded in the MFI inter-
est rate statistics on lending in the German
banking system provide additional informa-
tion not only on the transmission mechanism
but also for other purposes. Looking at the
shares of loans to households and non-
financial corporations in outstanding busi-
ness, for example, allows us to analyse the
importance of the individual loan categories
in Germany. On an annual average for 2010,
loans to non-financial corporations made up
slightly more than one-third (36.9%) of the
outstanding bank loans reported in Germany.
The vast majority of outstanding loans wereto households, which together accounted for
a share of 63.1 %. Lending for house pur-
chase made up the lion’s share of outstand-
ing loans to this sector (42.9%), whilst loans
for consumption and for other purposes had
a 20.2% share. Comparing the various loan
types by original maturity reveals that loans
with maturities of more than 5 years account-
ed for the largest volume share in all categor-
ies. The shares of the individual types of loan
were remarkably stable over time. Since the
MFI interest rate statistics were introduced in
2003, for example, the share of loans to non-
financial corporations in total outstanding
loans has increased slightly by 1.5% percent-
age points, whilst the share accounted for by
loans for consumption has decreased by
around 2.4 percentage points. There was
little change in the importance of loans for
house purchase, which rose by only 0.9 per-
centage point.
Interest rates on outstanding loans show
that, since 2003, loans to households for con-
sumption and other purposes have, unsur-
prisingly, been significantly more expensive
than loans to non-financial corporations. The
average difference amounted to almost 175
basis points. Moreover, it is striking that the
interest rates on all loans for house purchase
fell over the entire observation period. This is
mainly due to the fact that outstanding loans
also encompass older loans with very long
maturities that were granted at significantly
higher interest rates than loans in recent
years. Overall, loans to households and non-Lending and deposit rates

57financial corporations bear higher interest
rates than the existing deposits held by thesesectors. This is also illustrated by the banks’interest margins, which, in this context, canbe defined as the difference between theaverage interest rates on outstanding loansand those on outstanding deposits. Thesemargins declined significantly in Germanyfrom 2003 to October 2008 owing to fallinglending rates in mortgage business and thefact that interest rates on deposits rose moresharply than lending rates in the period from2006 to 2008. This might also be becauseloans with longer maturities predominate inoutstanding business, meaning that the aver-age interest rates are slow to adapt to currentmarket conditions. By contrast, households’holdings of higher-interest short-term de-posits rose significantly from mid-2006 on-wards as a result of the rise in the ECB’s keyinterest rates, whilst holdings of longer-termdeposits remained relatively constant. An-other likely reason for the steep rise in depositrates is the turmoil on the money market thatbegan in mid-2007, which caused liquidityshortages at banks. The banks tried to com-pensate for the lack of interbank liquidity bytaking up more deposits, which they aimedto attract by raising interest rates. Once theESCB’s non-standard monetary policy meas-ures had restored calm on the money market,
deposit rates initially declined slightly. Therewas no sustained fall in deposit rates until theECB began to lower the main refinancing ratein stages from October 2008 onwards in thewake of the financial crisis. Deposit rates thenfell more sharply than lending rates, causinginterest margins to widen. However, lookingat the gross interest margins provides only aninitial indication of the banking sector’s finan-cing situation. It is not possible to draw anydirect conclusions about banks’ earningssituation on this basis given that they oftenalso raise finance through issuing securities,amongst other things, and have othersources of income.

By introducing new categories for collectingdata and thus improving the cross-borderharmonisation of the MFI interest rate statis-tics, the overhaul has significantly enhancedthe options for analysing cross-border issues.As the database is now sufficiently broad,these issues and the associated analyses willincreasingly enter the spotlight in the comingyears.

59Fundamental features of the German Bank
Restructuring Act
One of the key lessons learned from the recent crisis is that the existing legal basis for the orderly
recovery or resolution of a systemically important bank (SIB) that has become distressed has
proven to be insufficient. The specific contents of a framework for improved crisis management
and orderly bank resolution are therefore currently being discussed and developed at the inter-
national and European level along with ways of both strengthening the capital and liquidity base
of systemically important institutions and intensifying the supervision to which SIBs are subject,
thus reducing the danger of their collapsing.
German legislators have already taken action at the national level with the Act on the Restructur-
ing and Orderly Resolution of Credit Institutions, on the Establishment of a Restructuring Fund
for Credit Institutions and on the Extension of the Limitation Period for the Liability of Governing
Bodies under Company Law ( Gesetz zur Restrukturierung und geordneten Abwicklung von
Kreditinstituten, zur Errichtung eines Restrukturierungsfonds für Kreditinstitute und zur Ver-
längerung der Verjährungsfrist der aktienrechtlichen Organhaftung ), hereinafter referred to as
the Bank Restructuring Act. According to the Federal Government’s bill (Bundestag printed
paper 17/3024), the desired legislative aim is to deal with a distressed SIB without jeopardising
the stability of the financial system. In developing the German solution, however, care was taken
to ensure that the new instruments are compatible with the European Commission’s existing
ideas for an EU framework for cross-border crisis management in the banking sector.

60Background
In the recent financial crisis, the existing legal
arrangements and prudential supervisory
instruments proved to be inadequate for
resolving SIBs without jeopardising the stabil-
ity of the financial system as a whole. During
the financial crisis, governments therefore
implemented bank rescue measures to avert
the negative consequences which a bank
insolvency would have for the stability of the
financial system. However, government inter-
vention of this kind entails the problem of
moral hazard. In this context, this means the
danger that government support measures,
or the prospect of such measures, could
create the wrong incentives by averting, or at
least mitigating, the negative consequences
of misguided action on the part of private
entrepreneurs or creditors, for instance, and
so contribute to lower risk awareness.
Ultimately, such state intervention can there-
fore encourage individual credit institutions
and their management to take greater risks,
as they are confident of receiving govern-
ment aid if necessary, especially if they have
reached a critical size (too-big-to-fail prob-
lem). Moreover, the financial crisis revealed
potential for improvement in terms of the
options for restructuring a SIB. A major
challenge, not least to effectively prevent
future crises, therefore also lies in developing
an internationally harmonised recovery and
resolution regime for systemically important
financial institutions (SIFIs).
Besides its specific operational design, the
question of how to fund such a recovery and
resolution regime is of key significance. Toavoid moral hazard, the financial sector itself,
rather than the government, should primarily
provide the necessary funds.
International recommendations and
European regulatory proposal
In March 2010, the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision published a report with
recommendations on cross-border resolution
and reducing the complexity and intercon-
nectedness of cross-border banking groups.1
These recommendations include, among
other things, the development of national
resolution regimes and measures to improve
coordination between the various supervisory
bodies in cross-border cases. At their June
2010 summit meeting in Toronto, the G20
leaders supported these recommendations
and committed themselves to implementing
the key recommendations.
The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has also
taken up the issue and, in October 2010,
published recommendations on how to deal
with SIFIs.2The FSB, too, believes that the
option of an orderly resolution of SIFIs – with-
out using taxpayers’ money – must be a
viable and credible option if the too-big-to-
fail problem is to be tackled effectively. The
FSB likewise recommends introducing reso-
lution instruments and regimes that take into

The FSB recommendations evengo so far as to suggest that the competentauthorities should be provided with thepowers – exercisable under clearly definedcriteria – to require credit institutions to makechanges to their legal and operational struc-tures and business practices in order to facili-tate the implementation of recovery andresolution measures. According to the FSB,cross-border cooperation should take place inbanking-group specific crisis managementgroups uniting the supervisory authorities,central banks as well as finance ministries andresolution authorities from the countries rele-vant to the banking group.
The FSB is currently carrying out more in-
depth work on this issue. It is, for instance,developing criteria for assessing whether theresolution of a SIFI is viable and credible, andconsidering key elements of institution-specific recovery and resolution plans (RRPs),which are considered necessary to preparefor crisis management.
Within the European Union, the European
Commission has conducted a consultation onthe technical details of a possible EU frame-work for bank recovery and resolution
3based
on its communication of 20 October 2010 ona new EU framework for crisis managementin the financial sector.
4The responses re-
ceived5will play an important role in shaping
a legislative proposal, which is to be passedby the end of 2011. In the consultation paperon the technical details and contents of anEU framework, the Commission provides notonly for more extensive supervision, a cata-
logue of early intervention powers for super-visors (including the appointment of a specialmanager to take over from or assist the exist-ing management of a credit institution) aswell as arrangements for the intra-grouptransfer of assets, based on voluntary agree-ments, but also for recovery and resolutionplanning in non-crisis times. Under the Com-mission’s proposal, institutions should drawup recovery plans at entity and group level.According to the Commission’s explanations,resolution plans should be prepared by thecompetent authorities, as these plans shouldalso include information on the application ofgovernment instruments. In addition, whereimpediments to resolution are discoveredduring planning, authorities should beallowed to order measures in non-crisis times.The proposed measures range from specificdisclosure requirements and the duty to pro-vide service level agreements

62resolution regime that would also take into
account resolution at group level. As its next
step, the Commission plans to examine the
need to harmonise the rules on bank insolv-
encies in a report to be presented at the end
of 2012 and, if necessary, to draw up a legis-
lative proposal on this issue, too. Finally, in a
last step, the creation of an integrated reso-
lution regime and potentially a European
resolution authority is to be considered.
German Bank Restructuring Act
On 1 January 2011, the Bank Restructuring
Act entered into force in full in Germany.
According to the Federal Government’s bill,7
the legislative aim is to be able to deal with a
distressed SIB without jeopardising the stabil-
ity of the financial system. The new instru-
ments are, moreover, to allow coordinated
action with other competent authorities at
the European level if a cross-border banking
group becomes distressed. When drafting the
Bank Restructuring Act, therefore, care was
taken to ensure that the new instruments are
compatible with the European Commission’s
existing ideas for an EU framework for cross-
border crisis management in the banking
sector.
The Bank Restructuring Act is an omnibus act
containing articles putting in place new legis-
lation and amendments to existing legislation
required as a result, articles 1 to 3 of which
we will describe in greater detail. Article 1 of
the Bank Restructuring Act puts into force the
Credit Institution Reorganisation Act ( Gesetz
zur Reorganisation von Kreditinstituten ),which outlines a procedure to recover and
reorganise credit institutions. Article 2 of the
Bank Restructuring Act strengthens the pru-
dential supervisory toolkit available under the
German Banking Act ( Kreditwesengesetz )b y
adding new measures for crisis management
and extends this toolkit by including the
instrument of the transfer order as an official
restructuring or resolution measure. In add-
ition, the Restructuring Fund Act ( Restruk-
turierungsfondsgesetz ; article 3 of the Bank
Restructuring Act) stipulates the setting up of
a Restructuring Fund as a special fund of
the Federal Government to finance future re-
structuring and resolution measures at banks.
Credit Institution Reorganisation Act
The Credit Institution Reorganisation Act out-
lines a two-stage procedure for the recovery
and reorganisation of credit institutions. This
procedure, which has to be initiated by the
credit institution, provides a framework for
internal crisis management. It offers senior
management a set of instruments with which
to develop its own solutions and avoid the
imposition of supervisory measures.
The recovery and reorganisation procedure
does not affect the (prudential supervisory)
powers of the Federal Financial Supervisory
Authority (BaFin), including its right to apply
for the initiation of insolvency proceedings
under the Banking Act. This could be the case
where, for instance, action in accordance
with the Credit Institution Reorganisation Act
does not seem promising or if reasons for

63insolvency arise while the procedure is under
way.
The first stage, the recovery procedure, gives
senior management additional options tomanage a crisis well before insolvency occurs.The reorganisation procedure, which isplanned as the second stage, is, in principle,based on the existing insolvency plan proced-ure. Unlike in the recovery procedure, thereorganisation procedure may involve anintervention in third-party rights (creditor andshareholder rights).
Recovery procedureThe recovery procedure is initiated by the
institution notifying BaFin that it requires re-covery (section 2 (1) of the Credit InstitutionReorganisation Act). The requisite recoveryplan must be attached to the notification; thecredit institution has the right to propose arecovery adviser. The recovery plan maybasically include all measures suitable for thecredit institution’s recovery without inter-vening in third-party rights. It can, however,favour certain recovery loans by giving prefer-ential treatment to the creditors of loans orother credit claims that the credit institutiontakes out in implementing the recovery planin the potential event of insolvency withinthree years of the recovery procedure beingordered (section 2 (2) of the Credit InstitutionReorganisation Act). A ceiling must, however,be set for these privileged claims, which maynot exceed 10% of the institution’s ownfunds.As in insolvency proceedings, BaFin has the
right to apply for a recovery procedure to beconducted (to be distinguished from initiationby the institution) and, if it is expedient to doso, files an appropriate application with thecompetent Higher Regional Court ( Ober-
landesgericht ) in Frankfurt am Main (section 2
(3) of the Credit Institution ReorganisationAct). BaFin must comment on the recoveryplan given its specialist knowledge as thecompetent supervisory authority. Its feedbackshould, in particular, include an assessmentof the prospects for successful recovery andof the suitability of the proposed recoveryadviser.
The Higher Regional Court orders the recov-
ery procedure to be conducted and appointsthe proposed recovery adviser provided theperson who has been put forward is not obvi-ously unsuitable (section 3 (1) of the CreditInstitution Reorganisation Act). As the keyfigure in the recovery procedure, the recoveryadviser implements the recovery plan andis obliged to report regularly to the HigherRegional Court and BaFin on recoveryprogress (section 6 of the Credit InstitutionReorganisation Act). The recovery adviser hasextensive powers by law (section 4 of theCredit Institution Reorganisation Act), egwide-ranging rights to obtain informationand the right to issue instructions to seniormanagement. A court order can be used togrant the recovery adviser additional powersor allow additional measures to be taken vis-à-vis the credit institution, provided this isnecessary for recovery and if there is a dangerthat the institution will default on its commit-ments to creditors (section 5 of the Credit

64Institution Reorganisation Act). The recovery
adviser must report both the success and the
failure of recovery to the court after having
first notified BaFin. The court must then de-
cide whether to end the recovery procedure.
By ordering certain measures pursuant to the
Banking Act, BaFin can also end the recovery
procedure at any time (section 2 (4) of the
Credit Institution Reorganisation Act). On the
whole, the initiation of a recovery procedure
can make it easier for senior management to
manage a crisis as it provides the instrument
of privileged recovery loans. However, the
appointment of a recovery adviser curtails
management’s powers. Moreover, it is uncer-
tain how the markets will react and what the
impact on refinancing costs will be when it
becomes known that senior management
considers a recovery procedure to be neces-
sary.
Reorganisation procedure
In cases in which a reorganisation procedure
is to be conducted after a recovery procedure
has failed, the recovery adviser notifies BaFin
with the consent of the credit institution. The
reorganisation plan must be submitted along
with the notification. In cases where a recov-
ery procedure offers no prospect of success
from the outset, this second procedural stage
can also be initiated immediately through
submission of notification and a reorganisa-
tion plan to BaFin.
While all credit institutions domiciled in Ger-
many may resort to the recovery procedure
to manage a crisis, the scope of application
of the reorganisation procedure is limited.BaFin can apply to the competent Higher
Regional Court in Frankfurt am Main to carry
out a reorganisation procedure only if there is
a going-concern risk to the credit institution
pursuant to section 48b (1) of the Banking
Act that results in a systemic risk pursuant to
section 48b (2) of the Banking Act (section 7
(2) of the Credit Institution Reorganisation
Act).
Provided the application to conduct the
reorganisation procedure is not rejected
because of an inadequate reorganisation
plan, the Higher Regional Court decides
– after consulting BaFin, the Deutsche
Bundesbank and the credit institution –
whether there is a going-concern and a
systemic risk and whether to order the pro-
cedure (section 7 (3) and (4) of the Credit
Institution Reorganisation Act).
The reorganisation plan and the reorganisa-
tion adviser are – like the recovery adviser
and plan in the first procedural stage – key to
the reorganisation procedure. The reorgan-
isation plan consists of a descriptive and a
constitutive part. It may envisage either the
recovery or the liquidation of the credit insti-
tution. The descriptive part of the reorganisa-
tion plan informs all of the parties involved
of the basic elements and effects of the
reorganisation plan in preparation for a
decision either for or against the plan. The
constitutive part determines how the legal
position of those involved is to be changed
(section 8 (1) sentence 3 of the Credit Institu-
tion Reorganisation Act). As mentioned

65Going-concern and systemic risk within the meaning of section 48b of the Banking Act
Going-concern risk (section 48b (1) sentence 1
of the Banking Act )
”Going-concern risk is the danger of the
credit institution collapsing as a result of in-solvency if no corrective measures are taken.”
According to the explanatory memorandum
to the Federal Government’s bill (Bundestagprinted paper 17/3024), this does not have toinvolve a specific imminent default or immi-nent overindebtedness. The Banking Act citescases in which a going-concern risk is pre-sumed to exist owing to a qualified breach ofprudential own funds or liquidity require-ments (section 48b (1) sentence 2):
”Going-concern risk shall be presumed to
exist if
1 the available tier 1 capital represents less
than 90 per cent of the tier 1 capital requiredpursuant to section 10 (1);
2 the modified available capital represents
less than 90 per cent of the own funds re-quired pursuant to section 10 (1);
3 the liquid assets available to the institution
in a maturity band defined by the statutoryorder pursuant to section 11 (1) sentence 2represent less than 90 per cent of the pay-ment obligations that are callable in the samematurity band, or
4 facts are known which warrant the assump-
tion that a shortfall pursuant to numbers 1, 2and 3 will occur if no corrective measures aretaken; this is the case, in particular, if a lossmay be anticipated based on the institution’searnings situation, as a result of which theconditions of numbers 1, 2 or 3 would be
met.”
Systemic risk (section 48b (2) sentence 1 of
the Banking Act )
”Systemic risk shall be deemed to exist if there
is concern that the credit institution’s going-concern risk could have a significantly nega-tive impact on other financial sector enter-prises, on the financial markets or on thegeneral confidence of depositors and othermarket participants in the proper functioningof the financial system.”
The term ”systemic risk” produces a correl-
ation between the going-concern risk of a spe-cific credit institution and the risks to financialmarket stability. The factors to be taken intoaccount when assessing whether there is a sys-temic risk, which are listed in section 48b (2)sentence 2 of the Banking Act, are givenmerely by way of example. These include, forinstance, the nature and scope of the institu-tion’s liabilities to other institutions and otherfinancial sector enterprises, interconnected-ness with other financial market participants,and the conditions on the financial markets, inparticular the consequences which marketparticipants expect the institution’s collapse tohave on other financial sector enterprises, onthe financial market and on the confidence ofdepositors and market participants in theproper functioning of the financial market.According to the explanatory memorandum tothe Federal Government’s bill, the factorsgiven by way of example in the Act cover themost common, currently known contagionchannels through which a crisis at one institu-tion can lead to the impairment of financialsystem stability as a whole.

66recovery plan, can involve intervention in
creditors’ rights and shareholders’ status.
Section 13 of the Credit Institution Reorgan-
isation Act stipulates that debt relationships
with the credit institution cannot, as a gen-
eral rule, be terminated as of the day on
which BaFin receives an application to initiate
the reorganisation procedure until the end of
the next business day. This applies to notice
of termination and any other reasons for
termination or conclusion. Section 14 of the
Credit Institution Reorganisation Act lays
down how creditors whose rights are subject
to intervention pursuant to section 12 of the
Credit Institution Reorganisation Act can
register their claims. Creditors’ voting rights
can be determined only if the reason for and
the amount of the claim are given when it is
registered.
The reorganisation plan must specify groups
for voting pursuant to sections 17 and 18 of
the Credit Institution Reorganisation Act
where the rights of those involved are subject
to intervention (section 8 (2) sentence 1 of
the Credit Institution Reorganisation Act).
Pursuant to section 8 (2) sentence 4 of the
Credit Institution Reorganisation Act, share-
holders are deemed to be a separate group
only if the reorganisation plan includes provi-
sions for which a decision by the sharehold-
ers’ meeting is necessary under company law
or is stipulated in the Credit Institution
Reorganisation Act. Each group of creditors
with voting rights must vote separately on
the reorganisation plan (section 17 (1) of the
Credit Institution Reorganisation Act). Share-
holders vote on the reorganisation plan sep-arately at a shareholders’ meeting called by
the reorganisation adviser (section 18 of the
Credit Institution Reorganisation Act). The
acceptance of the reorganisation plan re-
quires the approval of all groups (section 19
(1) sentence 1 of the Credit Institution Re-
organisation Act).
In each of the individual groups of creditors,
the vote is decided by a majority as measured
by the number of voting creditors as well as
by a sum majority according to the volume of
claims. However, section 19 (2) to (4) of the
Credit Institution Reorganisation Act also pro-
vides for cases in which approval is deemed
to have been granted despite the required
majority not having been reached in a group
of creditors or if the shareholders withhold
approval.
When the reorganisation plan has been ac-
cepted by the groups of creditors and by the
shareholders, it must also be confirmed by
the Higher Regional Court (section 20 (1) of
the Credit Institution Reorganisation Act).
Once judicial confirmation has been received,
the arrangements laid down in the constitu-
tive part of the plan take effect for and
against those involved (section 21 (1) of the
Credit Institution Reorganisation Act). The
Higher Regional Court, by confirming or
rejecting the reorganisation plan, decides on
the termination of the reorganisation proced-
ure (section 22 (1) of the Credit Institution
Reorganisation Act). However, the constitu-
tive part of the reorganisation plan may stipu-
late that the reorganisation adviser is to

67Possibilities for intervention in third-party rights in the reorganisation procedure
Conversion of claims to capital (section 9 of
the Credit Institution Reorganisation Act)
It can be stipulated in the constitutive part of
the reorganisation plan that creditor claimsare to be converted into capital shares in thecredit institution by means of a debt-equityswap. However, the creditors must agree to aconversion of this kind. Moreover, the exist-ing shareholders must be adequately com-pensated for such action. The amount of thiscompensation must be determined by one ormore expert auditors.
Other provisions under company law
(section 10 of the Credit InstitutionReorganisation Act)
The constitutive part of the reorganisation
plan may also lay down any provisions permis-sible under company law and may, thus, in-clude not only the debt-equity swap arrange-ment but also other changes to the credit in-stitution’s structures, for example, amend-ments to its articles of association or articlesof incorporation or the transfer of the creditinstitution’s participation or membership rightsin other companies, if this would be benefi-cial to the reorganisation. The law providesfor appropriate financial compensation forloss of assets on the part of existing share-holders.
Spin-off (section 11 of the Credit Institution
Reorganisation Act)
According to the explanatory memorandum
to the Federal Government’s bill, spin-off is afurther key element in the reorganisation ofcredit institutions. A credit institution may
stipulate in the constitutive part of its re-organisation plan that all or part of its assetsare to be transferred to a legal entity (whichalready exists or is to be established) in ex-change for the institution being grantedshares in this legal entity. Thus, the credit in-stitution’s assets are spun off to one or morelegal entities by way of (partial) universal suc-cession, which offers a means of dividing thebusiness into sound and unsound units orinto different business areas. The constitutivepart of a reorganisation plan must containstipulations regarding the key principles ofthe spin-off. It can also stipulate that individ-ual assets, liabilities or legal relationships areto be retransferred to the transferring creditinstitution (section 11 (1) sentence 2 of theCredit Institution Reorganisation Act).
Intervention in creditors’ rights (section 12 of
the Credit Institution Reorganisation Act)
Pursuant to section 12 of the Credit Institu-
tion Reorganisation Act, in principle the con-stitutive part of the reorganisation plan mayalso envisage, for instance, a reduction in or adeferral of claims. Pursuant to section 12 (2)and (3) of the Credit Institution Reorganisa-tion Act, claims for which a creditor could as-sert a compensation claim vis-à-vis a guaran-tee scheme within the meaning of section 23aof the Banking Act if a compensation eventwere to occur, claims which are covered by avoluntary guarantee scheme, as well as salaryclaims by employees and claims for an occu-pational pension by persons entitled theretoare excluded from this arrangement.

tion Reorganisation Act).
Amendments to the Banking Act
Besides the voluntary two-stage procedure
under the Credit Institution Reorganisation
Act, which aims to achieve a consensus be-
tween supervisors, the credit institution and
its creditors, changes to the Banking Act
envisaged under the Bank Restructuring Act
will strengthen and expand the sovereign
crisis management toolkit. First, the measures
in special cases cited in the Bank Restructur-
ing Act that BaFin can take are intended to
strengthen crisis prevention and to create
incentives for credit institutions to restructure
themselves independently well in advance of
an insolvency occurring. Second, BaFin’s
powers have been extended by the possibility
of issuing a transfer order which offers instru-
ments with which to restructure or resolve a
failing credit institution in an orderly fashion.
The transfer order is, therefore, a key answer
to the too-big-to-fail problem which was
mentioned in the early part of this article.
Extension of supervisory measures in special
cases
Pursuant to section 45 (1) of the Banking Act,
BaFin may order an institution to take meas-
ures to improve the adequacy of its own
funds and liquidity if the development of its
assets, finances or profitability warrants the
assumption that it will not be able sustainably
to fulfil the statutory requirements. The
amended version of section 45 (1) of the
Banking Act describes the preconditions forintervention such that BaFin has the option of
intervening at an early stage in order to
prevent financial distress. Examples of the
preconditions for intervention based on the
solvency ratio pursuant to the Solvency Re-
gulation ( Solvabilitätsverordnung ) and the
liquidity ratio pursuant to the Liquidity Regu-
lation ( Liquiditätsverordnung ) are intended to
provide greater legal certainty. The powers to
intervene where statutory minimum capital
or liquidity requirements are breached are
now laid down in section 45 (2) of the Bank-
ing Act. BaFin’s ability to order that a restruc-
turing plan has to be presented is a new add-
ition. In this plan, the institution must set out
how and within what period of time its own
funds adequacy or liquidity is to be sustain-
ably restored. The order may stipulate that
BaFin and the Deutsche Bundesbank must
regularly receive progress reports. The re-
structuring plan must be transparent, plaus-
ible and substantiated (section 45 (2) sen-
tence 2 of the Banking Act). It must specify
concrete and verifiable objectives, interim
targets and deadlines for the implementation
of the measures described. BaFin may inspect
the restructuring plan and the associated
documentation at any time. Moreover, pursu-
ant to section 45 (2) sentence 5 of the Bank-
ing Act, BaFin may demand that the restruc-
turing plan be amended and lay down
requirements in this regard if it considers
the specified objectives, interim targets and
implementation deadlines to be inadequate
or if the institution does not adhere to them.

her with performing tasks at an institutionand assign him/her the requisite powers. Thespecial representative need not always as-sume the tasks and powers of a governingbody or a member of a governing body of theinstitution, but may also take on specific,limited tasks. The law stipulates that he/shemust be independent, trustworthy and suitedto properly carrying out the tasks entrustedto him/her with a view to ensuring the sus-tainability of the institution’s business policyand safeguarding financial market stability.Where he/she is to assume the tasks of asenior manager or governing body, he/shemust possess the requisite professionalexpertise. Section 45c (2) of the Banking Actcontains a sizeable yet non-exhaustive list ofthe tasks that may be assigned to the specialrepresentative, such as elaborating a restruc-turing plan. According to section 45c (7)sentence 1 of the Banking Act, the specialrepresentative shall be liable for wilful intentand negligence. Section 45c (7) sentences 2and 3 of the Banking Act state that liabilityfor damages shall be limited in its amount inthe case of negligent conduct.
Introduction of measures vis-à-vis credit
institutions in the event of risks to the stabilityof the financial system – transfer order
The key amendment to the Banking Act is the
introduction of the transfer order as an offi-cial measure vis-à-vis credit institutions in theevent of risks to the stability of the financialsystem. Pursuant to section 48a et seq of the
Banking Act, BaFin can use a transfer order totransfer all or some of a credit institution’sassets including its liabilities to an existing
legal entity (transferee legal entity) throughspin-off. The transfer order is a means ofallowing the measures required to stabilisethe credit institution to be taken without theshareholders having to agree to these meas-ures. Thus, for instance, systemically import-ant parts of a credit institution may be trans-ferred to a transferee legal entity. Such atransfer of systemically relevant business unitshas the advantage that subsequent stabilisa-tion measures can concentrate on the trans-feree legal entity. As regards the credit insti-tution and the non-systemically importantbusiness units that it retains, insolvency pro-ceedings are, in principle, possible after thespin-off, as at least systemic importance anda resultant danger to financial stability are nolonger an issue.
A transfer order can be issued only if the
credit institution’s viability as a going concernis jeopardised, thereby placing the stability ofthe financial system at risk. For a definition ofthe terms going-concern and systemic risk,see the description of the reorganisation pro-cedure above (see box on page 65). Anothermandatory precondition is that the systemicrisk arising from the going-concern risk can-not be eliminated with equal certainty in anyother way than through the transfer order. Itis, therefore, clear that the transfer ordermust be regarded only as a measure of lastresort. Ultimately, a balance must be foundbetween the interests and rights of thoseaffected by the transfer order and the publicinterest in maintaining systemic stability.

70Fund – eg to stabilise the transferee legal en-
tity or to establish a bridge institution – the
transfer order is to be issued in agreement
with the Steering Committee pursuant to the
Financial Market Stabilisation Fund Act
(Finanzmarktstabilisierungsfondsgesetz ). The
benchmark for establishing whether BaFin,
the Steering Committee and the Financial
Market Stabilisation Agency ( Bundesanstalt
für Finanzmarktstabilisierung ) are acting law-
fully in issuing and executing a transfer order
is the question of whether, after judicious ap-
praisal of the circumstances evident at the
time of their action, they could assume that
the preconditions for their action have been
met. BaFin assesses whether going-concern
and systemic risk exists after consulting the
Deutsche Bundesbank. The joint assessment
of both institutions is to be documented in
writing.
Before issuing the transfer order, BaFin may
in principle give the credit institution the
opportunity to present, within a set time
limit, a viable recovery plan indicating in what
way going-concern risk will be averted. The
transfer order may be issued only if the trans-
feree legal entity agrees to the transfer (sec-
tion 48c (3) sentence 1 of the Banking Act),
which requires notarisation. Where the trans-
feree legal entity does not have the authorisa-
tion required, the transfer order shall be
deemed to grant authorisation to the trans-
feree legal entity with the same scope as the
authorisation granted to the credit institution
(section 48g (6) of the Banking Act). Section
48c (5) of the Banking Act contains criteria
for preclusion from acting as a transferee
legal entity, which are based on the precondi-Partial retransfer and partial transfer
It is possible to retransfer individual spun-
off assets to the transferring credit institu-
tion by means of a retransfer order within
four months of a spin-off taking effect. Ac-
cording to the explanatory memorandum
to the Federal Government’s bill (Bundes-
tag printed paper 17/3024, page 67), a re-
transfer of this kind may be considered, for
instance, if it becomes apparent that the
desired objective of overcoming going-
concern and systemic risk requires only cer-
tain business units and not all of them to
be transferred. The spun-off assets to be re-
transferred are selected in accordance with
section 48j (3) of the Banking Act. Other
than in specific exceptional cases, for ex-
ample in connection with financial collat-
eral, the spun-off assets are generally se-
lected on the basis of their significance for
averting the systemic risk emanating from
the credit institution in an effective and
cost-efficient manner. Where they are
equally significant for averting this systemic
risk in an effective and cost-efficient man-
ner, the selection of liabilities is based on
the ranking relevant in insolvency proceed-
ings over the credit institution’s assets.
Pursuant to section 48k (1) of the Banking
Act, the transfer order may stipulate that
only part of the assets, liabilities and legal
relationships are to be transferred to the
transferee legal entity (partial transfer).
Section 48k (2) of the Banking Act contains
provisions regarding the selection of busi-
ness units to be spun off by means of par-
tial transfer. BaFin is authorised to issue fur-
ther follow-up orders within four months of

The consideration must becommensurate with the value of the trans-ferred assets at the time at which the transferorder is issued. Government assistance andsupport payments from the RestructuringFund may not be taken into consideration.An expert auditor appointed by the court atthe request of the Financial Market Stabilisa-tion Agency shall verify the adequacy of theconsideration. Where a conclusive and reli-able valuation of the assets to be transferredis not possible before the transfer order isissued, the transfer order can be based on aprovisional valuation; in this case, a final valu-ation shall be carried out at a later date. Thesame applies to a partial retransfer or a partialtransfer. Where the aggregate value of theassets to be transferred is negative, however,the credit institution must compensate thetransferee legal entity in cash (section 48d (6)sentence 1 of the Banking Act).
The transfer order must be published prompt-
ly in the electronic Federal Gazette ( Bundes-
anzeiger ). The credit institution (including the
competent works council) and the transfereeMeasures at the credit institution and

Key measures at the credit institution (section 48l
of the Banking Act)
Pursuant to section 48l (1) of the Banking Act,
BaFin may revoke the credit institution’s author-isation if, once the transfer order takes effect,the credit institution is unable to maintain itsoperations in conformity with the provisions ofthe Banking Act. Moreover, pursuant to sec-tion 48l (2) of the Banking Act, as long as theviability of the business units transferred tothe transferee legal entity as a going concern isjeopardised and it has not been determined thatthe restructuring objective has been achieved,BaFin can instruct the credit institution to exer-cise the voting rights to which it is entitled atthe shareholders’ meeting of the transferee legalentity in a particular manner, apart from in thecases cited in the Act. In addition, the credit insti-tution may not, without written permission fromBaFin, dispose of its capital shares in the transfer-ee legal entity as long as the going-concern riskto the business units transferred has not beenlastingly averted (section 48l (3) of the BankingAct).
Key measures at the transferee legal entity (sec-
tion 48m of the Banking Act)
The transferee legal entity has extensive duties
to provide BaFin with information on all circum-stances of relevance for assessing the viability ofrestructuring for the business units transferred.Pursuant to section 48m (1) sentence 2 of theBanking Act, the viability of restructuring is therealisability of creating an asset, financial orearnings situation that ensures the long-termcompetitiveness of the transferred enterprise(restructuring objective). Section 48m (6) of theBanking Act stipulates that, if the transfereelegal entity has been granted support paymentsby the Restructuring Fund or another form ofsupport payment in order to overcome thegoing-concern risk or to achieve the restructur-ing objective, BaFin may, until the restructuringobjective has been achieved, prohibit payouts tothe shareholders of the transferee legal entity,to the holders of other – precisely defined – ownfunds components and to creditors to whomcertain subordinated liabilities are owed. If therestructuring objective cannot be achieved orcan be achieved only on disproportionate eco-nomic terms and if the enterprise can be woundup without jeopardising the stability of thefinancial system, BaFin, in consultation with theFinancial Market Stabilisation Agency, maydemand that the transferee legal entity draw upa liquidation plan, may declare the liquidationplan drawn up to be binding and may take themeasures necessary to execute it (section 48m (7)to (9) of the Banking Act). The liquidation planmust show that, and in what way, the enterprisebeing maintained as a going concern by thetransferee legal entity is to be wound up in anorderly manner.

72legal entity must also be informed of the
transfer order. Pursuant to section 48g (1) of
the Banking Act, the spin-off takes effect
when notification of the transfer order is
given. The entries necessary to conduct the
spin-off, therefore, have only a declaratory
effect. Pursuant to section 48g (2) of the
Banking Act, once the spin-off takes effect,
the spun-off assets earmarked by the transfer
order pass to the transferee legal entity, and
the credit institution has a right to the consid-
eration or must pay the compensation liabil-
ity.
The provision in section 48g (7) of the Bank-
ing Act, whereby debt relationships may not
be called or terminated solely by virtue of the
transfer to the transferee legal entity, is par-
ticularly important. This provision addresses
the event-of-default problem. This occurs
when the use of supervisory measures or pro-
cedures gives rise (or could give rise) to calling
rights vis-à-vis the credit institution or could
trigger automatic termination of contract. It
is intended to prevent the spin-off being
jeopardised by automatic termination or call-
ing rights solely because of the transfer order
and the associated capital outflows. Other
calling or termination rights are unaffected,
however.
Pursuant to section 48i (1) of the Banking
Act, if a spun-off asset is subject to foreign
law under which the legal effects of the
transfer order do not apply, the credit institu-
tion is obliged to work promptly towards a
transfer in accordance with the relevant pro-
visions under the foreign legislation.Restructuring Fund Act
The Restructuring Fund Act, which came into
force on 31 December 2010, is based on
article 3 of the Bank Restructuring Act and
provides for a Restructuring Fund for credit in-
stitutions to be set up at the Financial Market
Stabilisation Agency. All credit institutions
within the meaning of section 1 (1) of the
Banking Act that are subject to the provisions
of the Regulation on the Accounting of Credit
Institutions and Financial Services Institutions
(Kreditinstituts-Rechnungslegungsverordnung )
are required to contribute. Promotional banks
are exempt given their specific business
model. The Restructuring Fund, which will be
set up as a special fund of the Federal Gov-
ernment, is to be used to finance future re-
structuring and resolution measures for SIBs.
The amount which a credit institution must
contribute is intended to reflect its individual
systemic risk and is based, in particular, on its
size and interconnectedness in the financial
markets. The Restructuring Fund can take the
following measures, amongst others: it may
establish a bridge bank and acquire participa-
tions, it may grant guarantees, and it may
carry out recapitalisation measures.
Under the legislation, the financial resources
needed for the Restructuring Fund’s meas-
ures will be raised by means of an annual
contribution and, where necessary, special
contributions to be made by the credit institu-
tions required to contribute. The Restructur-
ing Fund’s target level amounts to €70 billion.
Some €1 billion are expected to be raised on
an annual basis. However, the amount raised
is volatile because of the way in which contri-Exclusion of

73Calculating the bank levy pursuant to the Restructuring Fund Regulation
Based on section 12 of the Restructuring Fund
Act ( Restrukturierungsfondsgesetz ), the Re-
structuring Fund Regulation ( Restrukturier-
ungsfonds-Verordnung ), which has yet to be
enacted by the German government, stipu-lates the following legal requirements for col-lecting the bank levy.
Annual levyAn institution’s contribution-relevant liabilities
are derived from the total liabilities in its mostrecently approved financial accounts withinthe meaning of section 340a of the GermanCommercial Code ( Handelsgesetzbuch )
minus the following liability items listed on
form 1 of the Regulation on the Accountingof Credit Institutions and Financial Services In-stitutions ( Kreditinstituts-Rechnungslegungs-
verordnung ):
– liability item 2, “liabilities to customers”
excluding liabilities to legal persons inwhich the credit institution holds a par-ticipation within the meaning of sec-tion 271 (1) of the Commercial Code;
– liability item 10, “profit participation cap-
ital” excluding profit participation capitalthat is redeemable within less than twoyears;
– liability item 11, “fund for general bank-
ing risks”;
– liability item 12, “equity”;plus– the nominal volume of derivatives pursu-
ant to section 36 of the Regulation on theAccounting of Credit Institutions and Fi-nancial Services Institutions.
Progressivity of the levyThe component of the assessment base that is
derived from the liability side of an institu-tion’s balance sheet is multiplied by varying
levy rates, which are staggered progressivelydepending on predefined volume categories.
A uniform levy rate is applied to the nominal
volume of derivatives when calculating theannual contribution.
Special contributionsIf the Financial Market Stabilisation Agency
finds that the funds it requires are notcovered by regular levies, it can collect specialcontributions. On request, it can release indi-vidual credit institutions from the obligationto pay such contributions if this would endan-ger the institution itself.
Reasonable limit, minimum contribution,
retroactive collection, contribution ceiling
An institution’s annual contribution should
not exceed a certain percentage of its annualresult according to the profit and loss accountafter adjustment for profits ceded on thebasis of a profit-pooling agreement, a profittransfer agreement or a partial profit transferagreement (reasonable limit). However, creditinstitutions must pay at least one annual con-tribution in relation to the calculated annualcontribution. This minimum contribution is al-ways levied even if it exceeds the reasonablelimit. Capped contributions must be paidretroactively if the reasonable limit is not ex-hausted by the regular annual contribution(retroactive collection) in one of the subse-quent years. Including retroactive contribu-tions, an institution’s total levy paymentsmust not exceed the reasonable limit for thecurrent contribution year. The total contribu-tions levied in a contribution year (annualcontribution, any retroactive contributions,any special contributions) must not exceed acertain percentage of the average of the pre-vious three annual results (contribution ceil-ing).

74butions are calculated and depends on the
respective bank’s earnings situation; the
actual inflow of annual funds is therefore
difficult to forecast over time.
With regard to an institution’s systemic risk
based on its size, the levy is calculated using
the balance sheet total and the volume of
derivatives. The bank levy has been designed
with the intention of being a measure that
is simple and robust, but nonetheless risk-
adjusted. While the group of banks that will
be subject to the levy and the basic aspects
relating to collection of the levy have already
been laid down in the Restructuring Fund
Act, a statutory order (Restructuring Fund
Regulation ( Restrukturierungsfonds-Verord-
nung )), which has yet to be enacted by the
German government and requires approval
from the upper house of parliament (Bundes-
rat), details additional legal stipulations in
respect of contribution rates, the definition of
a reasonable limit and the collection proced-
ure. The Bundesrat has yet to pass the draft
regulation (Bundestag printed paper 17/
4977). The main features of levy collection
are outlined in the box on page 73. The credit
institutions are obliged to send the Financial
Market Stabilisation Agency, which is tasked
with carrying out the restructuring measures
and administering the Restructuring Fund,
the data needed to determine and collect the
annual and special contributions. The data re-
quired to calculate the annual contributions
must be confirmed by an external auditor and
submitted to the Financial Market Stabilisa-
tion Agency by 15 July of each year. Annual
contributions will be payable by 30 September
of every calendar year, with the first paymentdue by 30 September 2011. In order to
minimise banks’ administrative burden, the
data used to calculate the bank levy is to be
collected via the Bundesbank’s existing
prudential reporting infrastructure (ExtraNet).
Assessment and outlook
In introducing the Bank Restructuring Act,
Germany has responded to international rec-
ommendations to develop national resolution
regimes. The Act contains extensive provi-
sions that may facilitate the recovery and
reorganisation of banks. Moreover, BaFin’s
powers of early intervention have been im-
proved through the introduction of additional
supervisory measures. However, the high
degree of complexity of the supervisory
measure that is the transfer order means that
the operational details of the transfer of
assets, including liabilities, of the credit insti-
tution in question still have to be worked out.
In the context of crisis management, cross-
border implications must also be considered.
Recent experience has made it abundantly
clear that crises do not stop at national
boundaries. Those credit institutions whose
going-concern risk could jeopardise the finan-
cial system are predominantly active on a
global scale. In such cases, purely national
action to resolve a crisis will hardly suffice.
What are needed are sustainable solutions,
cooperation between the competent national
authorities and harmonised resolution re-
gimes at the international or at least the Euro-
pean level in order to take account of the
cross-border dimension of global credit insti-Bank levy based

75tutions’ activities and structures, which are
subject to different legal systems, includinginsolvency legislation. In addition, the Ger-man Act has limited scope with regard toforeign legal relationships, as evidenced, forinstance, by the event-of-default issue whichis addressed in the Bank Restructuring Act. Apurely German approach to solving thisproblem is likely to be insufficient in the caseof internationally active credit institutions, asnational rules apply only to agents subject tothe relevant legislation, who may, however,also have concluded contracts subject to thelaws of other legal systems and with contract-ual partners not subject to EU legislation.Therefore, to resolve the event-of-defaultissue in connection with resolution measures,international rules and cooperation are neces-sary. These should, in particular, also involvethe relevant international agencies, such asthe International Swaps and Derivatives Asso-ciation.
It remains to be seen what results and recom-
mendations will be developed at the inter-national level and whether the regulationannounced by the European Commissionmeans that legal amendments have to bemade to current legislation. According to themost recent ideas expressed by the EuropeanCommission, banks will, for instance, have todraw up recovery plans at entity and grouplevel, while the competent authorities willalready have to produce resolution plans innon-crisis times. The details of the Commis-
sion’s proposals still require in-depth dis-cussion; nonetheless, on the question ofwhether to go ahead in the first place, aninternational consensus is emerging for pro-ducing such recovery and resolution plans asa key pillar of crisis management. The con-tents of these plans do not, however, cor-respond to the recovery, reorganisation andrestructuring plans stipulated under Germanlegislation.
As regards the bank levy, it should be con-
sidered that other EU countries have alreadyintroduced, or are about to introduce, similarlevies. However, these levies may have adifferent scope of application and differentassessment bases. In order to avoid a doubleburden, especially for cross-border creditinstitutions, it is advisable to coordinate thelevy concepts between member states or toharmonise them at the EU level. Work on thisissue is currently under way. The Germanbank levy might, therefore, have to be ad-justed as a result of future harmonisationsteps. Harmonising the basic framework for abank levy reduces the danger of potentiallycreating an uneven playing field for EU coun-tries. However, the time is not yet ripe for across-border banking fund given the fiscalsovereignty of member states and the neces-sary link between material and fiscal responsi-bility.
