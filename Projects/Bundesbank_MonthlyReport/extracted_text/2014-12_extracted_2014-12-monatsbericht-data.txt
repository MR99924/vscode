Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The German economy made a subdued start to 
the final quarter of 2014. There was no signifi -
cant increase in industrial output in October 
 either and it thus continued its sideways move -
ment. There are, however, initial signs that the 
economy as a whole could be picking up more 
strongly. After a deterioration lasting more than 
six months, business sentiment improved again 
slightly in November, and industry reported a 
marked increase in orders in October. In add -
ition, exports rose again and the improved con -
sumer sentiment promises buoyant consump -
tion. Continuing employment growth and a 
distinct rise in real wages are both playing a 
part in this.
The fall in crude oil prices is also boosting 
households’ purchasing power. The price of 
crude oil has gone down from a level of around 
US$110 for a barrel of Brent in mid- year to less 
than US$65 as this report went to press. It 
 declined by one- fifth over the last four weeks 
alone. Such movements in the price of crude 
oil are usually reflected without major time lags 
in the prices of fuel and heating oil. Pressure 
therefore eased on the budgets of households 
and enterprise in the last few weeks, and 
 resources were freed up for other uses. This 
should give further momentum to economic 
activity. For consumer prices, the latest decline 
in oil prices means that the annual rate of infla -
tion is likely to  continue to go down initially 
and probably  approach zero for a time.
Industry
In October, industrial output was up only ¼% 
on the month after seasonal adjustment and 
was therefore virtually unchanged, despite the 
fact that, unlike in the previous year, there was no bridge day in October, which suggested a 
somewhat stronger increase. In comparison 
with the previous quarter, output was likewise 
showing a sideways movement. This was also 
largely true of output in the most important 
sectors.
In October, new orders for German industry 
showed an increase of no less than 2½% on 
the month in seasonally adjusted terms, with 
domestic orders of motor vehicles, trailers and 
semi- trailers playing a key role. These increased 
by one- sixth on the previous month’s, admit -
tedly, very low level. Compared with the aver -
age of the previous quarter, the overall increase 
in orders amounted to 1¾%. Domestic orders 
climbed steeply by 3¼%, albeit only marginally 
by ¼% if the automotive industry is excluded. 
Demand from euro- area countries and non-  
euro- area countries expanded by 1% in each 
case. Capital goods producers recorded a 1½% 
increase in orders. Orders of intermediate 
goods were well up by 2¾% on their level in 
the previous quarter, which was chiefly due to 
extremely strong demand from the euro area. 
By contrast, orders of consumer goods showed 
hardly any overall increase (+½%).
Industrial sales in October were 1¼% up on the 
month after seasonal adjustment. There was an 
increase of ¾% compared with the average of 
the third quarter, which was mainly due to 
higher export sales (+2%). The increase in non- 
euro- area countries (+2¼%) was somewhat 
higher than that in the euro area (+1¾%). By 
contrast, domestic sales did not quite match 
their level in the third quarter (-½%). Exports of 
goods contracted slightly by ½% on the month 
in October but were 1% up on the high level of 
the preceding quarter. The value of imports 
 decreased significantly in October by 3% com -
pared with September, but almost matched the 
average of the third quarter (-¼%).Only subdued

Construction
According to the figures which are to be re -
garded as provisional, construction output 
went up in October by a seasonally adjusted 
1½% on the month,1 thus showing an increase 
on the year again. Compared with the average 
of the third quarter, there was an increase of 
½%. Output in the main construction industry 
rose by 1¼%, while remaining unchanged in 
the finishing trades, the reports of which are 
subject to substantial revision. After seasonal 
adjustment, orders received in the main con -
struction sector in the third quarter of 2014 
– figures are available up to then – were 3% 
down on the quarter. This was mainly due to a 
 decline in orders for housing construction.
Labour market
Employment is continuing to rise. In October, 
the number of persons in work in Germany 
showed a distinct seasonally adjusted rise of 
33,000 on the month. The year- on- year in -
crease was 403,000, or 0.9%. According to 
 estimates by the Federal Employment Agency, 
the number of employees subject to social 
 security contributions saw a very sharp season -
ally adjusted month- on- month increase of 
67,000 in September. This followed a sideways 
movement in August due to the holidays. The 
annual increase in September was 508,000, or 
1.7%. The labour market outlook is still posi -
tive. According to the Ifo survey, the willingness 
of enterprises to recruit new staff declined 
markedly in November in seasonally adjusted 
terms, but was still geared to expansion. The 
Federal Employment Agency’s BA-  X job index 
maintained its high level after seasonal adjust -
ment.
The official unemployment figure showed a 
further fall in November, with a seasonally 
 adjusted decline of 14,000 compared with Expansion in

 October. There was also a further fall in under -
employment, which also includes persons tak -
ing part in labour market policy measures 
( excluding short- time work). The unemploy -
ment rate remained unchanged at 6.6%. Offi -
cial unemployment was 89,000 lower than its 
figure in the previous year. The labour market 
barometer of the Institute for Employment 
 Research (IAB) improved again in November 
and is compatible with a slight decline in un -
employment over the next few months.
Prices
Given that OPEC was unable to reach an agree -
ment on production quotas, crude oil prices 
showed a further steep decline over the past 
few weeks. The price for a barrel of Brent crude 
oil had gone down to US$64½ by mid-  
December. Compared with the average of the 
previous month, prices fell by 9¼% in Novem -
ber and by a further 14½% in the first two 
weeks of December. The discount on crude oil 
futures in mid- December was US$3 for deliver -
ies six months ahead and US$5¾ for purchases 
12 months ahead.
Import prices in October remained unchanged 
on the month in seasonally adjusted terms. 
While energy prices fell sharply under the influ -
ence of crude oil prices, prices of other goods 
rose markedly, probably owing to the euro’s 
depreciation. Domestic industrial producer 
prices  decreased slightly, which was also due 
solely to the energy component. The year- on- 
year decline went down to 1.2% in the case of 
import prices and remained at 1.0% for indus -
trial producer prices.
Consumer prices in November showed a fur -
ther slight month- on- month fall amounting 
to 0.1% in seasonally adjusted terms. Energy 
prices underwent a significant decline, with 
food prices also going down. By contrast, 
prices of industrial goods went up somewhat. 
Housing rents continued their moderate up -
ward trend. The sub- index for services re -mained unchanged overall owing to a rather 
weak increase in the prices of package holi -
days. Annual inflation as measured by the 
 national CPI and the HICP declined by 0.6% 
and 0.5% respectively. A further fall in the year- 
on- year rates is in the offing in view of the drop 
in the crude oil prices.
Public finances2
Statutory health insurance 
scheme
In the third quarter of 2014, the finances of the 
statutory health insurance scheme deteriorated 
on the year. It posted a deficit of €1 billion after 
having recorded an almost balanced budget in 
the third quarter of 2013. The statutory health 
insurance institutions’ previous surplus of 
 almost €½ billion shifted to a slight deficit. The 
health insurance fund’s deficit doubled from 
€½ billion to just short of €1 billion, with the 
cut in the central government grant accounting 
for about half of this increase. At the end of 
September 2014, the statutory health insur -
ance institutions’ reserves amounted to €16 bil -
lion, while those of the health insurance fund 
totalled €9½ billion.3
The statutory health insurance institutions’ rev -
enue continued to rise by just under 4½% due 
to ongoing transfers from the health insurance 
fund – their main source of revenue.4 However, Clear further fall

2 In the short commentaries on public finances, the em -
phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Report (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain a detailed description of 
public finance developments during the preceding quarter. 
For detailed data on budgetary developments and public 
debt, see the statistical section of this report.
3 Every statutory health insurance institution is required to 
maintain minimum reserves of one- quarter of a month’s 
expenditure, which amounts to around €4 billion overall 
(section 261 (2) of the Social Security Code Book V). The 
minimum reserves of the health insurance fund are one-  
fifth of a month’s expenditure, ie currently just over €3 bil -
lion (section 271 (2) of the Social Security Code Book V).
4 The cut in the central government grant to the health 
insurance fund has no impact on scheduled transfers to the 
statutory health insurance institutions, as the fund’s re -
serves are used to offset the shortfall.Deutsche Bundesbank

The implementation of fi  scal rules in the 
European monetary union
Confi  dence in the soundness of several 
countries’ public fi  nances took a severe 
blow during the fi  nancial crisis. In order to 
prevent crises of this nature from emerging in future, various steps have been taken, in-cluding reforming the EU’s fi  scal framework 
and reinforcing the role of the European 
Commission. However, there is no evidence thus far that the binding effect of the new rules has been strengthened. The rules have become highly complex and very diffi   cult to 
follow, with their implementation some-
times appearing to be negotiable.
In mid- October 2014, the governments of the euro- area countries submitted their draft (general government) budget plans 
for 2015 to the Commission as part of Euro-
pean budgetary surveillance.1 In its state-
ments, the Commission focuses on the fi  s-
cal policy stance of the euro area as a 
whole, on the one hand, and assesses com-
pliance with the requirements for national fi  scal policy, which stem from the Stability 
and Growth Pact (SGP), on the other.
Neutral fi  scal policy stance expected 
in euro area as a whole
Taking into account the national budget 
plans that were submitted, the Commission 
forecast issued early in November revealed 
that, following a standstill in consolidation 
in 2014, the euro area as a whole will again adopt a neutral fi  scal policy stance in 2015. 
Given the expected economic outlook and 
uncertainties, the Commission considers 
this stance appropriate. But as there is still a 
need for further consolidation in some countries in order to ensure compliance 
with fi  scal rules, the Commission called for 
other countries to soften their planned 
budget stance in line with European rules.However, such a request has no weight be-
hind it. Generally, fi  scal policy in the Euro-
pean monetary union falls under the remit 
of each member state, provided this state complies with budget rules and its fi  scal policy does not have an unduly adverse  effect on other member states. There are no plans to fi  ne- tune the economy by co-
ordinating national fi  scal policies. If a major 
macroeconomic disturbance in the Euro-
pean monetary union were likely, however, 
the union as a whole could fall back on  corresponding exemption clauses. In its 
forecast, the Commission believes produc-
tion capacity in the euro area to be consid-
erably underutilised at present. But it ex-
pects  actual growth in the economy to be 
much faster than potential growth in com-ing years and, as a result, the output gap to 
shrink signifi  cantly. There are no signs of a 
self- reinforcing defl  ationary spiral. Against 
this background, it appears acceptable for 
the euro- area aggregate to adopt a slightly 
tighter fi  scal policy stance, which would occur if all countries were to comply with 
fi  scal rules. Otherwise, the danger would be 
that confi  dence in the soundness of public 
fi  nances would be increasingly eroded by less stringent implementation of the re-
formed rules and that the rules would lose 
their binding effect. The German govern-ment will signifi  cantly soften its budget 
stance next year. An additional loosening of fi  scal policy, as recommended by the Com-mission, does not appear appropriate given the cyclical position and the particular eco-nomic and fi  scal policy challenges faced by Germany, especially owing to its high debt- 
to- GDP ratio and changing demographics. While increasing public- sector investment by a certain amount could boost growth

justment programme are exempt from this obligation 
(currently Cyprus and Greece).Deutsche Bundesbank

potential, this could also be achieved by 
using funds more effi   ciently or by shifting 
budget items. Attempting to fi  ne- tune the 
economy at the European level through higher public spending in Germany would 
hold little promise of success due, for one, 
to the limited spillover effects that this 
would have.
Only fi  ve euro- area countries plan to 
fully comply with rules in 2015
Furthermore, the Commission assessed indi-
vidual draft budget plans in the context of 
its autumn forecast, which usually takes ac-
count of government plans. In its forecast, 
it projected that Germany, Luxembourg, the 
Netherlands, Slovakia and Ireland, which is 
subject to an excessive defi  cit procedure 
(EDP), will be the only fi  ve euro- area coun-
tries to fully comply with the European fi  s-
cal rules for 2015, with four further coun-
tries (Estonia, Latvia, Finland and Slovenia, 
which is also subject to an EDP) being 
deemed largely in compliance.
However, the budgets of seven countries 
risk failing to conform to fi  scal rules: Spain, 
France and Portugal are in danger of falling signifi  cantly short of their EDP targets, while 
Italy, Belgium, Malta and Austria are not 
 expected to comply with the requirements 
under the preventive arm of the SGP . Des-
pite this, the Commission will only go as far 
as calling on the countries in question to 
take additional consolidation measures for 
2015 and will not make use of the option to request a member state to revise its budget plan.
EDP decisions postponedIn addition to assessing budget plans for the 
coming year, the Commission also examined 
overall compliance with SGP  requirements for 2013 and 2014. However, decisions on this matter have been postponed, chiefl  y 
 affecting France, Italy and Belgium.France has been subject to an EDP since early 
2009, has already been granted two exten-
sions to the deadline to correct its  excessive 
defi  cit and does not plan to reduce its defi  cit ratio to below 3% of GDP until 2017,  although it had been requested to do so in 2015. A still 
signifi  cant, albeit somewhat lower than rec-
ommended, improvement in the structural 
balance was recorded in 2013. However, fur-
ther consolidation was minimal in 2014 and 
the Commission expects almost no additional improvement in 2015. According to the Com-
mission’s calculations, the Council’s recom-
mendations on correcting the excessive def-
icit were not achieved in 2013 or 2014 and will likewise not be achieved in 2015. Even the measures later promised by the French government for 2015 will not change that fact. Despite this, the Commission’s conclu-
sion is that the situation should be reassessed 
in March 2015 once budget planning has 
been concluded and the reform programme 
outlined.
The public fi  nance situation in Italy gives cause for concern, particularly due to its  extremely high government debt- to- GDP 
ratio. But Italy is not subject to an EDP; in-stead, it must meet requirements under the 
preventive arm of the SGP , which should 
gain in importance and, in particular, have a greater binding effect as a result of reform. 
In general, recommendations under the 
preventive arm require quick progress to be 
made towards a medium- term budgetary objective, which, in Italy’s case, is a struc-
turally balanced budget. However, Italy was exempted from this in 2014 as the Commis-
sion calculated that Italy’s potential output 
was largely underutilised. Although this 
 exemption should no longer be relevant in 
2015 due to a narrowing of the country’s 
negative output gap, the government does not plan to achieve the requested structural 
improvement. These requirements, which 
are established based on the debt criterion, 
are signifi  cantly more ambitious and, ac-cording to the Commission’s forecast, will Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
December 2014

not be broadly met in either 2014 or 2015.2 
The Commission also postponed any fur-
ther steps for Italy until March 2015.
At over 100%, Belgium’s debt- to- GDP ratio 
is also particularly high; according to the 
Commission’s forecast, there are likewise no signs of a trend reversal. Although the defi  cit ratio was below the 3% threshold 
again in 2013 (2.9%), it is likely to remain 
close to this reference value. While the structural balance is expected to improve marginally in 2014 and somewhat more 
sharply in 2015, this improvement is still 
 insuffi   cient measured in terms of the re-
quirements set out under the preventive 
arm of the SGP . As is the case in Italy, these 
requirements are more ambitious than the 
standard requirements under the preventive arm due to the debt criterion. The Commis-
sion therefore concludes that Belgium will breach its debt criterion in both 2014 and 2015. Further steps for Belgium were like-
wise postponed until March 2015.
Effective fi  scal rules are a key anchor 
of confi  dence
The Commission’s review of the draft budget 
plans in autumn is a process which has, at 
best, very limited repercussions. Even in the 
event of a serious breach, the Commission 
only has the power to request that the 
member state concerned submit a more ambitious budget plan. However, it would 
appear that the Commission itself does not 
wish to make much use of this  instrument. 
Government representatives from individual, potentially affected countries had previously 
declined intervention in national affairs. In 
addition, the decisions on possible proced-
ural or fi  nancial sanctions (opening a EDP 
based on non- compliance with the debt cri-
terion or tightening an EDP with possible 
fi  nes) were postponed.
Fiscal rules should safeguard sound public 
fi  nances. To this end, they also need to be transparent and comprehensible, in particu-lar. However, this will be even more diffi   cult 
to achieve if, in addition to rules being in-
creasingly complex and already diffi   cult to follow, consolidation progress can be 
traded for reform packages in future. Even 
though the amended fi  scal rules may ac-cord a certain degree of leeway to do so, 
the rules would be weakened further if the Commission were to make large allowances 
for structural reform plans when it re-
assesses the defi  cit situation in March 2015 and, consequently, were it to exculpate the 
fi  scal policy failures of previous years. This 
applies all the more so given that important 
reforms on product and labour markets or 
to reduce the cost of red tape do not have to place a strain on public fi  nances.
The SGP makes it possible to take account of 
a change in the macroeconomic environ-
ment. For example, if the economic situation 
were to take an unexpected and serious turn for the worse, the rules would allow require-ments to be adjusted. To that extent, dead-
lines could also be extended in individual 
cases. Even if the euro area as a whole were 
affected by a severe economic downturn, 
the rules would make it possible to respond 
to this by easing requirements. However, if such conditions are not present or they do 
not suffi   ciently explain deviations, it is crucial 
that agreements be complied with and im-
plemented in order to strengthen confi  dence 
in the sustainability of public fi  nances. It is precisely in the case of already very high debt- to- GDP ratios that credible fi  scal rules 
represent a key anchor of confi  dence.
2 The reference value for the debt- to- GDP ratio is 
60%. If the debt- to- GDP ratio exceeds the reference 
value, the debt criterion is also considered to have been observed if the ratio is suffi   ciently diminishing. The ratio is considered suffi   ciently diminishing if the differential with respect to the reference value de-
creases by 5% per annum. Transitional arrangements 
apply to countries that were subject to an EDP when 
the debt criterion was operationalised at the end of 2011. These arrangements involve calculating the  linear improvement of the structural balance that is 
suffi   cient to comply with the debt criterion at the end of a three- year transitional period.Deutsche Bundesbank

growth in expenditure (5½%) was much faster. 
Spending on pharmaceuticals continued to rise 
particularly sharply (by 11%) after the tempor -
ary increase in the manufacturers’ discount on 
patented pharmaceuticals essentially came to 
an end at the start of the year. A sharp rise in 
payments for hearing aids contributed to the 
considerable growth in spending on thera -
peutic treatment and aids (9%). Growth in sick -
ness benefit picked up again (by 10½%) and 
the strong take- up among older persons indi -
cates that it may increasingly be being used as 
a stepping stone to (early) retirement.5 By con -
trast, the rise in spending on in- patient and 
out- patient treatment (3% in both cases) was 
disproportionately low.
The health insurance fund continued to benefit 
from the favourable employment and wage 
 developments enjoyed by members of the 
statutory health insurance institutions. At 
 almost 4%, growth in contribution receipts 
was somewhat faster than in the previous 
quarters, driven by higher pension payments 
following the sizeable pension increase in mid-
2014 as well as the substantial expansion of 
pension benefits, even though the latter took 
effect with a delay. However, due to the cut in 
the central government grant (by €1 billion for 
the year as a whole), overall growth in revenue 
(just over 3%) was weaker. The transfers to the 
statutory health insurance institutions, which 
are fixed in advance, rose at a steady rate of 
4%.
At the end of September 2014, the cumulated 
deficit of the health insurance fund amounted 
to just over €4 billion. A considerable surplus is 
likely in the fourth quarter owing to the usual 
final- quarter bonuses as well as to particularly 
high contribution receipts as a result of the ex -
pansion of benefits in the statutory pension in -
surance scheme, and the constant monthly 
transfers to the statutory health insurance insti -
tutions. However, this will not be sufficient for 
the health insurance fund to achieve a bal -
anced budget. Nevertheless, the deficit should 
remain well below the figure of almost €3½ billion that was forecast in autumn 2013. The 
main reason why this estimate was wide of the 
mark was that employment developments 
proved to be better than expected. The statu -
tory health insurance institutions’ deficit for the 
first three quarters of 2014 totalled almost 
€1 billion. In the final quarter, when spending 
is typically high, the deficit is expected to 
widen. Compared with the autumn 2013 esti -
mates, which envisaged that transfers from the 
health insurance fund would cover expend -
iture, spending appears likely to increase at a 
somewhat slower pace than anticipated by the 
official estimators. However, the fact that the 
statutory health insurance institutions are still 
likely to close the year with a notable deficit is 
due, not least, to premium payouts by some 
institutions and voluntary benefits that the in -
stitutions have to fund themselves.Health insurance

The statutory health insurance institutions can 
set their own additional contribution rate for 
2015. In their autumn 2014 forecast, the offi -
cial estimators predicted that a total of 0.9% 
would be required to cover spending by the 
statutory health insurance institutions. Com -
bined with the general contribution rate of 
14.6% set by law, the levy rate would thus re -
main unchanged at 15.5% overall. In view of 
the statutory health insurance institutions’ 
often substantial reserves and their varying 
levels of spending, however, it is possible that 
they will set lower additional contribution rates 
on average. As transfers from the health insur -
ance fund are based solely on the receipts gen -
erated from the general contribution rate, this 
– viewed in isolation – would cause the statu -
tory health insurance institutions to initially 
 record a deficit, which they would then offset 
by charging additional contributions and using 
up some of their reserves. The health insurance 
fund is also expected to record a deficit be -cause the €2.5 billion cut in the regular central 
government grant (from €14 billion to €11.5 
billion) will not be passed on to the statutory 
health insurance institutions but will be offset 
using the fund’s reserves.
Public long- term care 
 insurance scheme
As in the third quarter of 2013, the public long- 
term care insurance scheme recorded a slight 
deficit in the third quarter of 2014. Employees’ 
contributions continued to rise (by 3½%) due 
to favourable employment and wage develop -
ments. Pensioners’ contributions increased at a 
much slower pace of 2%, although this rise 
was much sharper than in previous quarters. 
Due to delays in payment, the considerable 
 expansion of benefits granted in the statutory 
pension insurance scheme is yet to take full 
 effect. All in all, growth in revenue amounted 
to just over 3½%, while growth in expenditure 
was only a little higher at just under 4%. This 
resulted in a minimal deficit for the first three 
quarters of 2014. Including the usual final-  
quarter surplus, which is likely to be even larger 
this year as a result of contributions paid on the 
higher pension benefits towards the end of the 
year (the payment of which has been delayed), 
a considerable surplus is again likely for the 
year as a whole.
Under the recent nursing care reform, the con -
tribution rate is to be raised from 2.05% to 
2.35% (plus an extra 0.25% in each case for 
childless persons) effective from 1  January 
2015. This should generate additional receipts 
of just over €3½ billion, two-  thirds of which 
are earmarked for higher expenditure, while 
the remaining third is to be used to set up a 
separate reserve. Additional receipts equivalent 
to one- tenth of a percentage point of the con -
tribution rate will be paid into a precautionary 
fund administered by the Bundesbank. A cap -
ital stock is to be accrued by 2034 which will 
then be gradually depleted and could curb the 
expected rise in the contribution rate over the 2015: deficits set 
to riseDespite slight deficit in Q3, surplus likely for 2014 as a whole

Of course, this will only be possible if the gov -
ernment refrains from using these growing 
 financial reserves for any other purpose. This

tially just over €1 billion during the accrual 
phase.
Securities markets
Bond market
In October 2014, the issue volume in the Ger -
man bond market stood at €124.8 billion in 
gross terms (previous month: €102.2 billion). 
After deducting redemptions, which also in -
creased, and taking account of changes in is -
suers’ holdings of their own bonds, the volume 
of outstanding domestic bonds fell by €2.3 bil -
lion. However, foreign debt securities worth 
€7.9 billion net were sold in the German mar -
ket, causing the volume of outstanding foreign 
debt securities in the German bond market to 
increase by €5.6 billion on balance.
The public sector issued €5.6 billion worth of 
bonds in the capital market in October. Central 
government (including the resolution agency 
which is classified as part of central govern -
ment) accounted for €2.8 billion of this figure. 
It issued mainly ten- year Federal bonds (Bunds) 
and two- year Federal Treasury notes (Schätze) 
for €7.6 billion and €3.6 billion respectively, but 
also 30-year Federal bonds for €1.9 billion and 
Treasury discount paper (Bubills) worth €1.6 bil -
lion. This contrasted with net redemptions of 
Federal notes (Bobls) totalling €12.7 billion. In 
the month under review, the Federal states 
tapped the capital market for €2.8 billion net.
Domestic enterprises redeemed €1.6 billion net 
worth of bonds in October. On balance, these 
were primarily bonds with a maturity of more 
than one year. The redemptions were, on bal -
ance, solely attributable to other financial inter -
mediaries (not including insurers), while non-  financial corporations issued debt instruments 
to the net value of €0.1 billion.
Domestic credit institutions, too, reduced their 
capital market debt in the reporting month (by 
€6.3 billion on balance). Meanwhile, other 
bank debt securities and public Pfandbriefe 
were redeemed for €5.4 billion and €1.0 billion 
respectively, as well as, to a lesser extent, mort -
gage Pfandbriefe (€0.1 billion). By contrast, 
debt securities issued by specialised credit insti -
tutions were sold in the market for €0.3 billion 
net.
Domestic non- banks emerged as the sole pur -
chasers in October. They added, on balance, 
€13.1 billion worth of bonds to their portfolios. 
The majority of these were foreign securities. 
By contrast, German credit institutions reported 
net sales totalling €5.7 billion. In this case, it 
was mainly domestic securities which were 
sold. Non- resident investors’ sales of debt 
 securities totalled €0.8 billion net.Net redemptions

Equity market
In the reporting month, domestic enterprises 
placed €1.2 billion worth of new shares in the 
German equity market. The outstanding vol -
ume of foreign equities in the German market 
dropped by €1.3 billion in the same period. On 
balance, equities were purchased chiefly by for -
eign investors (€2.3 billion) and domestic non- 
banks (€2.1 billion). By contrast, domestic credit 
institutions disposed of equity instruments 
worth €4.6 billion on balance.
Mutual funds
In October, domestic mutual funds sold shares 
totalling €7.2 billion net in the German market 
(€3.1 billion in the previous month). On bal -
ance, fresh funds were injected solely into spe -
cialised funds reserved for institutional invest -
ors (€8.5 billion). Among the asset classes, it 
was mainly mixed funds (€12.4 billion) but also 
bond- based funds and mixed securities- based 
funds (€2.6 billion and €1.9 billion respectively) 
which recorded net inflows of funds. By con -
trast, share- based funds recorded considerable 
outflows of funds amounting to €9.4 billion. In 
the month under review, foreign funds traded 
in the German market sold shares to the tune 
of €2.3 billion. On balance, domestic non-  
banks were the main purchasers, adding €10.3 
billion net of mutual fund shares to their port -
folios. Domestic credit institutions acquired 
mutual fund shares worth €0.9 billion net. By 
contrast, foreign investors reduced their hold -
ings by €1.7 billion.
Balance of payments
The German current account recorded a sur -

The surplus in the goods account increased by 
€0.2 billion on the month to €24.2 billion. 
 According to the provisional calculations of the 
Federal Statistical Office, the foreign trade sur -
plus narrowed by €0.1 billion to stand at €21.9 
billion as the volume of imports was larger than 
that of exports. The slight improvement in the 
goods balance arose from the €1 billion in -
crease in net exports of goods under merchant -
ing and non- monetary gold. This outweighed 
the diminished foreign trade balance and the 
expanded deficit recorded under supplemen -
tary trade items, which amounted to €0.6 bil -
lion.
In October, the deficit on invisible current trans -
actions went up by €0.8 billion on the month 
to €1.0 billion. This was mainly due to the fact 
that the services account deficit climbed by 
€0.7 billion to €5.5 billion. Net receipts in the 
primary income balance came to €6.9 billion, 
placing them just €0.1 billion below the level of 
the previous month. The negative balance of 
secondary income remained virtually un -
changed at €2.4 billion.
Given the country’s unfavourable economic 
data and the dip in bond yields, cross- border 
portfolio investment in Germany saw net cap -
ital exports in the amount of €8.7 billion in 
 October. Resident investors bought securities 
issued by non- residents totalling €8.5 billion. 
Demand for foreign debt securities was espe -
cially high (€7.9 billion), mainly in the form of 
bonds. By contrast, foreign market participants 
sold German securities worth €0.2 billion on 
balance. While non- resident investors acquired 
German shares (€2.3 billion), they simultan -eously disposed of mutual fund shares (€1.7 
billion) and debt securities (€0.8 billion), mainly 
parting with money market instruments.
In October, much like cross- border portfolio in -
vestment, direct investment generated net cap -
ital exports to the tune of €2.3 billion. This was 
chiefly due to the fact that the volume of 
 foreign direct investment in Germany dimin -
ished by €2.0 billion as a result of transactions, 
a  development triggered by the €3.9 billion fall 
in lending volume. Resident enterprises pro -
vided their foreign branches with funds in the 
amount of €0.2 billion. During the same period, 
they increased their equity capital by €4.9 bil -
lion while simultaneously reining in their lend -
ing to affiliated enterprises abroad by €4.6 bil -
lion.
Other statistically recorded investment – com -
prising financial and trade credits (where these 
do not constitute direct investment), bank 
 deposits and other assets – likewise saw net 
capital outflows in October (€8.0 billion). While 
cross- border government transactions resulted 
in net capital exports amounting to €7.5 billion, 
enterprises and households experienced mod -
erate inflows of funds from abroad (€0.9 billion 
in net terms). Meanwhile, in the banking sys -
tem, credit institutions recorded a €20 billion 
increase in net external assets, whereas the 
Bundesbank’s external position shrank by 
€18.7 billion. Of this amount, €11.2 billion was 
 accounted for by the Bundesbank’s lower 
TARGET2 balance.

Outlook for the German economy –  
macroeconomic projections  
for 2015 and 2016
Following a brisk start to the year, which was not due solely to favourable weather conditions, 
the German economy moved onto a flatter growth path in the second and third quarters of 2014 
and thus did not live up to the expectations of the Bundesbank’s June outlook. Nor is a major 
improvement on the horizon for the final quarter of 2014 and first quarter of 2015. However, 
there is reason to hope that the current weak phase will prove to be temporary. The German 
economy remains in remarkably good shape, which is not only benefiting the domestic economy 
but also enabling German exporters to seize opportunities on foreign markets. Such opportunities 
should increase again over the course of 2015 provided that the economic recovery in the euro 
area strengthens and world trade gathers momentum.
Under these conditions, growth of 1.4% in Germany’s real gross domestic product (GDP) this year 
could be followed by a rise of 1.0% in 2015 and of 1.6% in 2016. After working- day adjustment, 
real GDP growth would come to 1.4% in 2014, 0.8% in 2015, and 1.5% in 2016. On average, 
these increases are slightly above the potential growth rate of just over 1% per year, which means 
that aggregate capacity utilisation should rise somewhat but remain at a normal level over the 
entire forecast horizon. Growth in potential output will be supported by immigration but damp -
ened by new rules enabling some workers to draw a full pension at 63 and by the forthcoming 
introduction of a general minimum wage in Germany. Unemployment, which, under the current 
institutional framework, is now largely reduced to its frictional and structural core, will probably 
see little change over the forecast horizon. A temporary deceleration in negotiated wage rises  
is likely to be offset by the new general minimum wage in terms of actual earnings. General 
 government is set to post a slight budget deficit next year given the substantial growth in expend -
iture.
The rise of just under 3% per year in wages will increasingly be reflected in somewhat higher 
consumer price inflation. As measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), infla -
tion could rise from 0.9% this year to 1.1% in 2015 and 1.8% in 2016, based on the assumption 
of unchanged exchange rates and a slight rebound in crude oil prices. Excluding energy, HICP 
inflation would climb to 2.0% in 2016.
Since this forecast was finalised, Brent crude oil prices have fallen substantially. They are thus an 
average of just over 11% below the assumptions underlying the forecast. A fall of this size in 
crude oil prices points to the need for a downward revision of the inflation forecast and an 
upward revision of projected GDP growth. If the low crude oil prices were to endure, projected 
HICP inflation for 2015 would need to be lowered by 0.4 percentage point. The repercussions for 
the real economy are more difficult to quantify. However, economic growth could consequently 
be 0.1 to 0.2 percentage point higher in the two coming years.Deutsche Bundesbank

Current situation
The German economy lost considerable mo -
mentum in the second and third quarters of 
2014 and moved onto a flatter growth path. 
Following a brisk start to the year, which was 
partly fuelled by favourable weather condi -
tions,1 real GDP did not grow any further in the 
second and third quarters after seasonal and 
working- day adjustment and thus failed to live 
up to the hopes of the June outlook,2 which 
had projected cumulated GDP growth of 0.6% 
over this period. On the supply side, it was 
mainly the production sector which underper -
formed expectations. On the expenditure side, 
investment was surprisingly weak, while private 
consumption increased perceptibly as ex -
pected.
The underlying trend in industrial activity has 
been stagnant since autumn last year and there 
is no sign of a pick- up so far. This lack of mo -
mentum was due, notably, to a deceleration of new orders received from non- euro- area coun -
tries, although orders from the euro area and 
Germany were also slack. This does not fit with 
the predictions in the June outlook. However, 
exports grew strongly, significantly exceeding 
expectations. They increased not only for con -
sumer goods but also, above all, for intermedi -
ate goods.
The strong upturn in business investment which 
had begun in the final quarter of 2013 and first 
quarter of 2014 came to a halt thereafter. This 
was mainly because the very optimistic busi -
ness expectations at the beginning of the year 
were not met and were gradually revised. 
Moreover, given the stagnation in new orders 
received, industrial capacity utilisation did not 
rise above normal levels, meaning that a key 
driver of investment was largely lacking. In 
addition, growing uncertainty, which was partly 
due to geopolitical tensions, encouraged in -
vestors to hold back and await further develop -
ments.
Contrary to expectations, the dynamics on the 
German housing market have slackened. This is 
apparent not only in the flatter price trend but 
also in the horizontal movement of important 
demand indicators, such as construction per -
mits. This waning momentum is likely to be 
one of the key reasons why, following the 
weather- induced high construction output in 
the first quarter, there were perceptible with -
drawal effects in the two subsequent quarters 
– contrary to the predictions in the June out -
look. It seems that the favourable weather con -
ditions in the first quarter did not boost annual German econ-
omy on flatter growth path

construction output but merely encouraged 
frontloading.
By contrast, private consumption rose in the 
second and third quarters as expected. Marked 
wage growth contrasted with a subdued infla -
tion rate, leading to a distinct rise in real dis -
posable income. With the saving ratio almost 
unchanged, private consumption rose sharply, 
partly because of the low rate of price in -
creases.
Despite weaker- than- forecast economic activ -
ity, employment rose by 170,000 persons in the 
second and third quarters and thus by around 
twice the amount assumed in the June out -
look. Contrary to assumptions, however, the 
number of unemployed persons did not fall 
after seasonal adjustment. Both of these devel -
opments may be attributable to the further sig -
nificant increase in immigration. At an esti -
mated 560,000 persons, net immigration is 
likely to considerably outstrip expectations 
again this year. That said, it is important to bear 
in mind that asylum seekers and civil- war refu -
gees – who are not immediately available to 
the labour market – account for a larger share 
of total immigration than in previous years.
In the second and third quarters, growth in 
wage costs fell somewhat short of expect -
ations. This was mainly due to an unexpectedly 
strong negative wage drift, particularly in a 
number of service segments. This is related, in 
part, to a reduction in the number of firms 
covered by collective labour agreements.
Consumer price inflation has levelled off dis -
tinctly, rather than rising somewhat as pro -
jected in June. While the June outlook foresaw 
HICP inflation of 1.2% in October, the Federal 
Statistical Office calculated an actual rate of 
only 0.7%. Just under half of the forecast error 
is attributable to the energy component, the 
remainder to other goods (excluding energy 
and food), services and housing rents. The 
error in the energy projection is due to the sud -
den drop in crude oil prices. In the other goods category, particularly large price cuts on cloth -
ing and footwear during the mid- season sales 
came as a surprise. In the case of housing 
rents, inflation has been rising more slowly 
than expected. The same applies to services 
prices, partly as a result of influences from 
abroad (eg via prices for package holidays).
In hindsight, it is clear that the projections in 
the June outlook were overly optimistic not 
only for world trade but also for the euro area 
and parts of the domestic economy. Accord -
ingly, various surveys and forecasts have re -
flected a less upbeat mood in recent months. 
While the risk assessment in the June projec -
tion highlighted the danger of duller external 
dynamics with knock- on effects on business in -
vestment, it did not anticipate the loss of mo -
mentum in the domestic housing market.Strong growth

Major assumptions
This projection is based on assumptions made 
by the Eurosystem’s experts concerning the 
global economy, exchange rates, commodity 
prices and interest rates. The assumptions are 
based on information available up to 14 No -
vember 2014. The assumptions regarding eco -
nomic activity in the euro area are derived from 
projections by the national central banks of the 
euro- area countries.
As predicted in the June outlook, global eco -
nomic growth appears to have strengthened 
over the course of the year so far. Contrary to 
expectations, however, this has not been re -
flected in world trade. This projection assumes 
that the world economy (excluding the euro 
area) can maintain the pace of growth achieved 
in the third quarter of 2014. This would mean 
that global growth (weighted by purchasing 
power parities) would rise from 3½% this year 
to 4% in 2015 and 4¼% in 2016. Global eco -
nomic growth would thus remain significantly 
below the pace seen prior to the crisis. In the 
industrial countries, the monetary policy stance 
is generally accommodative, while fiscal con -
solidation needs persist. In addition, potential 
growth has fallen. In the emerging market 
economies, structural bottlenecks and financial and macroeconomic imbalances are holding 
back economic expansion.
Unlike global output, in the second and third 
quarters of 2014 world trade (excluding the 
euro area) fell significantly short of expect -
ations, which is connected with still- subdued 
industrial activity. This year world trade will 
probably increase by only 2¾%, whereas the 
June projection assumed growth of just over 
4¼%. The forecast for 2015 has consequently 
been lowered to +4%. Distinctly stronger 
growth is not expected until 2016, when it is 
projected to be somewhat over 5%.
In the euro area, the process of economic re -
covery lost momentum in the second and third 
quarters of 2014. Excluding Germany, too, eco -
nomic growth was much lower than assumed 
in June, and the outlook has deteriorated. The 
negative reports were centred on the core 
euro- area countries, while the periphery coun -
tries hit hardest by the crisis outperformed ex -
pectations. While contractionary factors have 
predominated until now in the adjustment pro -
cess in these countries, expansionary forces 
now appear to be gaining the upper hand. By 
contrast, the growth process in the core euro- 
area countries is being hampered by continuing 
structural problems. However, the compara -
tively weak growth in world trade, the in -
creased geopolitical tensions, and sanctions 
and countermeasures in connection with the 
conflict in Ukraine are also likely to have played 
a role in the slowdown in growth. A strength -
ening of the economic upturn in the euro area 
is assumed in the forecast period, supported by 
the accommodative monetary policy stance, 
improved funding conditions and, above all, 
the more favourable outlook for global trade 
and lower crude oil prices. Even so, the disap -
pointments of the past half- year and the more 
subdued outlook for the coming months have 
led to a significant reduction of growth expect -
ations over the forecast horizon compared with 
the June projection. Despite the pick- up in eco -
nomic growth, aggregate capacity utilisation 
will still not reach a normal level in 2016, and Assumptions-

unemployment will probably fall only slightly. 
Euro- area GDP (excluding Germany) is expected 
to grow by just over ½% in 2014. Growth of 
just above 1% is projected for 2015 and of 
1½% for 2016.
In the euro area, the stronger economic growth 
will go hand in hand with an intensification of 
foreign trade. Nonetheless, intra- euro- area 
trade is likely to grow more slowly than world 
trade. In view of the major importance of the 
euro area, the same applies to the expansion in 
German enterprises’ sales markets, although it 
will probably strengthen markedly in the fore -
cast period, from 2½% in 2014 to 4¾% in 
2016.
Prompted by the deterioration in the economic 
outlook for the euro area and the ECB’s an -
nouncement of additional expansionary mon -
etary policy measures, the euro has depreci -
ated since the spring, thus largely cancelling 
out the appreciation which began in mid-2012. 
In the period underlying the exchange rate as -
sumptions, the euro stood at US$1.25 and was 
thus 9% below the projection in the June out -
look. The euro likewise depreciated against the 
renminbi, the pound sterling and the Swiss 
franc. In effective terms, the euro lost an aver -
age of 5% in value against the 20 most import -
ant currencies in terms of foreign trade.
After rising in June, crude oil prices moderated 
distinctly in the months that followed. The pro -
spect of abundant supply, which appears less 
affected by the geopolitical tensions than previ -
ously feared, coincided with slower growth in 
global demand. The futures prices from which 
the assumptions for crude oil prices are derived 
point to a slight increase from the beginning of 
2015, however. Non- oil commodity prices have 
also fallen since the June forecast, meaning 
that –  much like crude oil prices  – they will 
probably decline year on year in 2015 before 
rising again in line with world economic 
growth.In view of the weak growth momentum and 
the very subdued outlook for inflation, the 
Governing Council of the ECB agreed on add -
itional monetary policy measures at its meet -
ings in June and September 2014. They are in -
tended to help anchor inflation expectations 
over the medium to long term and steer HICP 
inflation back up closer to 2%. As well as fur -
ther lowering the ECB’s key interest rates, the 
Governing Council took decisions on purchases 
of asset- backed securities (ABS) and covered 
bonds, and on targeted longer-  term refinan -
cing operations. The possible macroeconomic 
repercussions of the non- standard monetary 
policy measures enter into the projections pri -
marily via the market expectations which form 
the basis for the derived technical interest rate 
assumptions. This applies in much the same 
way to the ECB’s comprehensive assessment of 
bank balance sheets, which was completed in 
October. All in all, expectations regarding short- 
term interest rates and yields on nine to ten-  
year government bonds have been lowered 
distinctly over the entire forecast horizon vis- à- 
vis the June outlook. Bank interest rates in Ger -
many are thus likewise projected to rise only 
marginally over the forecast horizon from their 
current very low level. According to a survey of 
firms’ funding conditions published by the As -
sociation of German Chambers of Industry and 
Commerce (DIHK) this summer and the Ifo 
Credit Constraint Indicator, access to loans in 
Germany still appears very good. It is not ex -
pected to deteriorate significantly over the 
forecast horizon.
The macroeconomic projection incorporates 
government measures that have either already 
been approved by parliament or have at least 
been defined in sufficient detail and are likely 
to be implemented. With respect to the labour 
market in Germany, these measures include the 
introduction of a general statutory minimum 
wage and of an early retirement option at the 
age of 63 on a full pension for long- term con -
tributors to the statutory pension insurance Sales markets

scheme.3 The option to retire at 63 on a full 
pension is expected to reduce the potential la -
bour force by around 165,000 persons, or 
0.4%, by 2016.4 The general minimum wage of 
€8.50 per hour, which will be introduced on 
1  January 2015, could raise the aggregate 
wage bill by just over ½%, with the bulk of the 
rise occurring in 2015. Although the minimum 
wage will increase pay mainly for part- time cas -
ual work (“mini- jobs”), it will also affect low-  
skilled regular jobs subject to social security 
contributions. Given that wage costs will rise 
fairly noticeably in some cases, employment 
prospects for the low- skilled are likely to 
worsen, which could raise the structural un -
employment rate in the medium term.
The fiscal policy measures included in the pro -
jection cause a deterioration in the general 
government fiscal balance for 2015 of just 
under ½% of GDP , and have a largely neutral 
fiscal impact in 2016. Changes to taxes and 
public levies will have just a slight effect overall 
on government revenue over the projection 
period. Although the contribution rate to the 
public long- term care insurance scheme will be 
raised in the coming year by an appreciable 
0.3 percentage point to 2.35% (2.6% for child -
less insurees),5 the contribution rate to the 
statutory pension insurance scheme will be cut 
by 0.2 percentage point to 18.7%. In addition, each health insurance institution will, from 
2015, determine their members’ income-  
related additional contributions on an individ -
ual basis. Some of the health insurers have high 
reserves, and it is to be expected that the aver -
age contribution rate will initially be lower than 
in 2014. From 2016, contribution rates are 
likely to be increased again. Growth in spend -
ing will be reinforced in the coming year by ex -
panded benefits in the statutory pension insur -
ance scheme6 and the public long- term care 
insurance scheme. There will also be additional 
expenditure in the areas of transport infrastruc -
ture, education and research over the entire 
projection period, though this will have a sig -
nificantly lower fiscal impact than the increases 
in social security spending.
Economic outlook7
Economic growth in Germany is likely to 
strengthen again only slowly. As yet, there is no 
indication of a radical cyclical improvement in 
the fourth quarter of 2014 and first quarter of 
2015. However, there is no evidence of reces -
sionary tendencies either. In the industrial sec -
tor, the sideways movement in new orders re -

3 From July 2014, workers who have contributed to the 
statutory pension insurance system for 45 years are able to 
draw a full state pension from the age of 63.
4 For details of the impact on potential output, see the box 
on pp 28-30.
5 The increase is part of a legislative package. Two- thirds of 
the additional receipts will be used to finance expanded 
benefits, and one- third will be allocated to a special re -
serve.
6 Since the expanded benefits (pension credits for child-  
rearing mothers, early retirement option at 63 on a full 
pension, higher pensions for reduced earning capacity) 
only became effective from mid-2014, there will be a sig -
nificant year- on- year rise in expenditure in 2015, too.
7 This projection for Germany was completed on 20 No -
vember 2014. It was incorporated into the projection for 
the euro area published by the ECB on 4 December 2014. 
This is the first projection compiled on the basis of ESA 
2010. For more information on the methodological 
changes in the national accounts and their implications, 
see Deutsche Bundesbank, Impact on GDP of the 2014 
major revision of national accounts, Monthly Report, Au -
gust 2014, pp 58-59, and Deutsche Bundesbank, Key ratios

ceived and capacity utilisation coupled with 
neutral production expectations suggest a 
largely unchanged level of output. The picture 
for the construction industry is similar. In the 
services sector, however, the signs continue to 
point to expansion. In macroeconomic terms, 
this means that, given normal weather condi -
tions, GDP growth rates of 0.1% and 0.2% can 
probably be expected in the two quarters. For 
2014, this would nevertheless imply an annual -
ised growth rate of just over 1.4% due to the 
strong economic performance in the final quar -
ter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014. The 
weak pace of growth over the rest of the year, 
however, would generate only a small statis -
tical carry- over.
Whether the German economy can grow more 
dynamically over the course of 2015 primarily 
depends on the international setting. If the 
economic recovery in the euro area picks up as 
expected and world trade gains renewed mo -
mentum, additional expansion will be possible. 
Since German enterprises are predominantly 
well positioned, with low debt and balanced 
price- cost ratios, and are present in all key mar -
kets with an attractive product offering, they 
should be able to take advantage of the oppor -
tunities that may arise. Given the extremely fa -
vourable funding conditions, this is likely to ex -
tend to investment as well. The domestic econ -
omy, too, is in good shape. Unemployment is 
low, average household debt is not excessive, 
and real wages are increasing distinctly. Con -
sidering the fairly favourable situation of public 
finances, steeper rises in public spending are to 
be expected. However, the unfavourable 
demographic outlook will weigh on the Ger -
man economy in the medium term, while pol -
icy measures such as early retirement at 63 on 
a full pension are already constraining the 
 labour supply.
Under these conditions, growth in the German 
economy could pick up to 1.2% in the course 
of 2015 and then accelerate to 1.5% in 2016.8 
Such a fourth- quarter rate would correspond 
to an annual average GDP growth rate of 1.0% in 2015 and 1.6% in 2016. In calendar- adjusted 
terms, this would mean increases of 0.8% and 
1.5% respectively. As a result, the German 
economy would be within the range of normal 
utilisation of aggregate capacity over the entire 
projection horizon, with estimated potential 
growth assumed to be 1.1% per year. This esti -
mate is based on a recalculation of potential 
output, which is discussed in more detail on 
pages 28 to 30.
Growth expectations for 2014 and 2015 have 
been clearly revised downwards compared 
with the June projection. While the downward 
revision of 0.5 percentage point for the 2014 
annual growth rate can be explained in very 
large part by already realised projection errors 
in the course of the year, the key factor for the 
2015 annual growth rate (-1.0 percentage Prerequisites for

point) is a much more cautious assessment of 
the macroeconomic outlook. The projection 
errors and the reduced expectations should 
also be seen in connection with the downward 
revisions of official GDP growth figures in 2012 
and 2013 by 0.3 percentage point in each case. 
Furthermore, the external setting is less favour -
able, which is reflected in significant cutbacks 
in the projection to the previously assumed sales 
market growth. Finally, the domestic housing 
market dynamics were overestimated, which 
likewise suggests a flatter rate of expansion.
A key prerequisite for the GDP path described 
above is that export growth accelerates. For 
the moment, however, survey results from Ifo 
and DIHK are pointing to a deceleration. While 
the EU’s sanctions against Russia and the Rus -
sian government’s countermeasures play a role 
in this, it is likely that disappointment at the 
muted cyclical momentum in the euro area is a 
more significant factor. Moreover, geopolitical 
crises are holding back investment, with direct 
consequences for German enterprises specialis -
ing in the manufacture of capital goods. The 
assumed pick- up in world trade and the 
strengthening economic recovery in the euro 
area should mean that exports expand more 
strongly, however. In view of what will prob -
ably turn out to be a weak fourth quarter of 
2014 and first quarter of 2015, export growth 
(as defined in the national accounts) may de -
crease from 3¾% in the current year to 3% in 
the coming year, before rising markedly to 
4½% in 2016.
Given the subdued short- term outlook for in -
dustrial activity, business investment is likely to 
pick up significantly in 2015 only after a time-  
lag. Barring any further disruptions that could 
impede the propensity to invest, the brighten -
ing sales outlook and associated increase in 
capacity utilisation should generate more in -
vestment in machinery, equipment and com -
mercial properties. Funding conditions are still 
very advantageous and support a normalisa -
tion of investment activity. However, it is im -
probable that the low interest rates alone will Exports set to

trigger a strong expansion of production cap -
acity in Germany. Obstacles to such a scenario 
are firms’ heightened risk awareness following 
 repeated disappointments in recent years and 
the contraction of the labour supply expected 
in the medium term as well as the already per -
ceptible shortage in skilled labour.
The basic conditions for expanded investment 
in housing construction are essentially still 
good. The higher demand for housing fuelled 
by positive employment and wage prospects 
will potentially be reinforced by the exception -
ally favourable funding conditions and the 
strong influx of immigrants. However, the re -
cent loss of momentum in the housing market 
indicates that the stimulus provided by the low 
interest rates seems to be subsiding. Added to 
this is the fact that the structure of immigration 
has changed, which makes it more difficult to 
gauge the impetus it provides to housing con -
struction. In addition, the revised national ac -
counts show a slightly larger construction vol -
ume for the recent past, meaning that the ad -
justment of the housing stock may well be 
more advanced than was thought in the spring. 
At any rate, the rise in building permits, which 
was still very steep a year ago, has clearly flat -
tened out. Nevertheless, the current correction 
phase should soon be completed and construc -
tion activity should return to a growth path.
Government investment is likely to rise signifi -
cantly in the current year, and the increase may 
accelerate in 2015. A higher level of public in -
vestment is expected in 2016, too. For ex -
ample, there are plans for catch- up and top- up

ture but also, for example, in childcare facil -

opment as well as the procurement of military weapon sys -
tems are now also classified as investment. While the for -
mer is likely to increase relatively continuously, the latter 
may fluctuate considerably from quarter to quarter and 
from year to year. This is because such expenditure is rec -
ognised at the date of delivery, which means that there 
may be major swings in individual quarters with substantial 
deliveries.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

Following growth of almost 3½% this year, 
gross fixed capital formation is likely to climb 
by a total of 2½% in the coming year and by 
just over 3½% in 2016. Fixed capital formation 
should thus make a renewed distinct contribu -
tion to economic growth.
Private consumption will likely continue to 
prove a reliable mainstay of domestic demand. 
At any rate, consumer sentiment has so far 
shown itself to be resilient to the growing 
gloominess in the corporate sector. Although, 
according to the GfK surveys, consumers have 
also revised their economic expectations down -
wards, they do not see their income prospects 
being adversely affected. This is due to the 
stable labour market situation. In line with this, 
the propensity to purchase has declined only a 
little, remaining at a high level. According to 
the present projection, households’ real dispos -
able income is likely to grow by 1¼% in the 
coming year, following an increase of 1% this 
year. It is benefiting not only from a higher pay 
trend due to the introduction of the statutory 
minimum wage and from ongoing employ -
ment growth but also from the subdued con -
sumer price inflation. Disposable income is being 
additionally supported by changes in govern -
ment levies and transfers, such as notably the 
expansion of pension benefits. In 2016, house -
holds’ real income should rise on a similar scale on the back of stronger wage growth and the 
continuing favourable labour market trend, 
even without fiscal support and despite rising 
inflation. Given a virtually unchanged saving 
ratio, growth rates in real private consumption 
will thus amount to 1¼% in 2015 and 2016, 
after an increase of 1% this year.
Government consumption is likely to increase 
clearly over the projection horizon, with all key 
sub- segments – social transfers in kind, person -
nel expenditure and intermediate consump -
tion – playing a role.
Growth in imports is expected to increase dis -
tinctly in the next two years, initially driven by 
the growth in private consumption and subse -
quently by the pick- up in investment on the 
back of reviving exports. It is assumed that the 
import content of key expenditure components 
will tend to increase further. This is an effect of 
the growing international division of labour. 
Overall, imports may rise by 4½% in 2015 and 
by 5¾% in 2016 (after 3½% in 2014). Thanks 
to their improving competitive position, Euro -
pean manufacturers are likely to reap greater 
benefits from this than firms from outside Eur -
ope.
All in all, the projection depicts an economic 
development that is still heavily dependent on 
external economic stimuli, but which is finding 
significant support from robust domestic de -
mand. The traditional growth decomposition 
ascribes the cyclical stimulus in the projection 
period solely to domestic final demand (in 
arithmetical terms, its expected contribution to 
growth exceeds economic growth in 2015 and 
2016). If the negative growth contribution of 
imports is allocated to the various expenditure 
components in line with the respective import 
shares, the arithmetical contribution to growth 
made by domestic demand decreases to ap -
proximately two- thirds.10 After factoring in the Gross fixed

economic causal relationships beyond the stat -
istical decomposition, the influence of external 
demand explains both the temporary deceler -
ation and the subsequent acceleration of GDP 
growth.
Germany’s trade surplus may rise to 6½% of 
GDP this year, primarily because of sharply fall -
ing import prices. In the two subsequent years, 
it should then ease to 6% owing to accelerated 
import growth on the back of improved invest -
ment. The increase in the terms of trade is likely 
to diminish markedly, but will prevent a deeper 
decline in the trade surplus. Since further in -
creasing inflows are expected to primary in -
come given the tendency towards growing net 
external assets, the underlying macroeconomic 
scenario implies little likelihood that the current 
account surplus will fall significantly below 7% 
of GDP .
Labour market
In spite of the unexpectedly weak economic 
growth in the second and third quarters of 
2014 and the gloomier outlook, the leading in -
dicators are pointing to a continuation of the 
positive overall development in the labour mar -
ket. Although, according to the DIHK and Ifo, 
firms have reduced their recruitment plans as 
against spring 2014, they wish to further ex -
pand their workforce on balance. By contrast, 
unemployment is trending sideways according 
to the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) 
labour market barometer. In this setting, the 
fairly steep rise in the Federal Employment 
Agency’s job index is signalling increasing diffi -
culties in filling vacant positions. This is presum -
ably attributable to a shortage of skilled labour; 
according to the DIHK survey carried out in au -
tumn 2014, two- fifths of firms view this as a 
risk to their business development. The mis -
match between firms’ specific employment 
needs and the labour supply profile is likely to 
be one reason why unemployment has not de -
creased further for a long time now and why 
the robust employment growth, largely fed by immigration, has been accompanied by a slow -
down in productivity growth, at least tempor -
arily.11
Employment growth is likely to be more mod -
erate in the medium term. Unemployment in 
Germany has already largely been reduced to a 
frictional and – under the current institutional 
framework  – a structural core. Moreover no 
further major increases are to be expected in 
the labour market participation rate given the 
level already achieved and the recently imple -
mented policy measures, such as the option of 
retiring at 63 on a full pension. Hence signifi -
cant net immigration will be required to achieve 
even moderate growth in employment. Ac -
cording to updated estimates, the net influx of 
immigrants is likely to rise much more signifi -
cantly over the next two years than was previ -
ously assumed, with an immigration surplus of 
500,000 and 400,000 persons, respectively. Current account

Revised estimate of the German economy’s potential output
The German economy’s potential output is 
currently increasing by just over 1% per 
year. This means that the medium- term growth outlook (adjusted for cyclical fac-
tors) is now assessed less favourably than in 
previous projections. The downward revi-
sion is due to the major revision of the na-
tional accounts data in the summer of 
2014, which now record considerably lower 
productivity growth for the last few years 
than the initial data. This and the effect of 
the new economic policy measure allowing 
long- term contributors to the statutory 
pension insurance scheme to retire prema-
turely at the age of 63 on a full pension 
– which entered into force this year and will 
tend to worsen the German economy’s supply conditions  – imply a perceptible downward revision of annual potential growth of ¼ percentage point compared 
with the 2013 estimate.1
Over the forecast horizon, the path of po-
tential output is not steeper than on aver-
age since the middle of the last decade, 
despite the currently very high immigration fi  gures. The net immigration recorded since 
the beginning of this decade is actually more than offsetting the demographically 
induced decline in the working- age popula-
tion. However, the ageing of the popula-tion is becoming increasingly relevant for 
the potential labour force as an ever greater 
proportion of the population is entering age cohorts that are characterised by a below- average labour force participation 
rate, despite perceptible increases in recent 
years.2 The foreseeable drain on the labour 
supply resulting from the option to retire 
prematurely at 63 on a full pension, and the 
increased infl  ux of refugees and asylum 
seekers are additional reasons why labour 
force participation makes no positive contri-bution to potential growth over the projec-
tion horizon, in contrast to the situation 
that prevailed for many years in the past.
Structural unemployment has fallen sub-
stantially due to far- reaching labour market 
and social reforms undertaken during the 
past decade.3 The impact of these reforms 
on potential output has largely tailed off, however.
4 The statutory general minimum 
wage is an encroachment on longstanding pay negotiation structures, the longer- term effects of which are determined by a range 
of factors that are diffi   cult to estimate (eg 
pass- through on prices, interaction with regulations on marginal employment, the role of the minimum wage commission). The pay increases triggered by the min-
imum wage, which are likely to be substan-
tial for some low- skilled jobs, and will pre-
sumably also place upward pressure on wage groups above the minimum wage level via the incentive effect, nevertheless 
harbour employment risks. Calculating the 
medium- term growth trend on a cautious 
basis, a rise in the structural unemployment 
rate could be assumed, with an associated 
1 The June 2014 projection already highlighted the 
risks that the full pension at 63 and the general min-
imum wage pose for the expected medium- term 
growth trend; see Deutsche Bundesbank, Outlook for 
the German economy – macroeconomic projections 
for 2014 and 2015 and an outlook for 2016, particu-
larly p 17. In June, the possible impact of the policy 
measures on potential output was estimated for the 
general minimum wage during the ongoing legislative process and for the full pension at 63 without any data on the expected take- up rate.2 See T A Knetsch, K Sonderhof and W Kempe (2014), 
Potential labour force in full- time equivalents: meas-urement, projection and applications, Deutsche Bun-
desbank Discussion Paper No 26/ 2013.3 See Deutsche Bundesbank, The macroeconomic im-
pact of labour market reforms in Germany, Monthly 
Report, January 2014, pp 34-36.

dampening of potential growth during the 
transitional period. However, during the 
period up to 2016, the impact of the min-
imum wage on potential output should be 
negligible in quantitative terms.
By contrast, the full pension at 63 will 
 already have a considerable impact in 2014 
and 2015. According to current estimates, 
the two policy measures will entail a loss in 
the level of potential output of just over 
½% up until 2016. This takes into consider-
ation the fact that the shortage of experi-
enced workers and increases in labour costs can have repercussions for investment plans 
and decisions on production locations. 
 Although the estimation is generally subject 
to considerable uncertainty, the size of the 
loss appears plausible, not least because it 
focuses almost exclusively on the impact of 
the full pension at 63. Factors determining 
the impact of this measure on potential growth are comparatively robust (eg the 
size of age cohorts and the number of po-tential benefi  ciaries), and initial reports indi-cate a very high take- up rate. From today’s 
perspective, the level loss in potential out-
put could almost double by 2020. This is 
due, on the one hand, to growing age co-
horts entitled to early retirement. On the other hand, the dampening effect of the minimum wage is also likely to be exerting its full impact by then.

Trend growth in total factor productivity (TFP) was recently no higher than during 
the period in which many low- skilled work-
ers (re)entered the labour market. Immi-
grants can often only fully unfold their cap-
abilities with a time delay owing to a set-tling- in phase, initial employment below their qualifi  cation level and language bar-
riers. This  implies a corresponding catch- up 
process in future years, which should con-
tribute to stronger TFP growth in the me-
dium term.
Finally, the revised estimate of potential output took into account the fact that re-
search and development expenditures were reclassifi  ed as fi  xed capital formation in this 
year’s major revision of the national ac-
counts.6 A large part of the level shift in the 
aggregate capital stock can be attributed to 
the expanded reporting of intangible fi  xed 
5 With regard to future adjustments to the minimum 
wage, it is assumed here that the recommendations of 
the minimum wage commission will –  in line with 
statutory requirements – be based on past negotiated 
pay increases.6 See Deutsche Bundesbank, Key ratios for macroeco-
nomic and government activity in Germany following

Nevertheless, given the higher share of civil-  
war refugees and asylum seekers, immigration 
is unlikely, at least in the short term, to swell 
the labour market to the same extent as in pre -
vious years.12
The wage increases triggered by the introduc -
tion of a general statutory minimum wage will 
probably place a burden on the demand for la -
bour in low- paid jobs and reduce employment 
opportunities for low- skilled workers. Those 
employed in part- time casual work (“mini-  
jobs”) are likely to be affected most. Many cas -
ual workers will reduce the average number of 
hours they work in order to stay below the 
monthly income threshold of €450 that quali -
fies for preferential treatment in terms of social 
security contributions. Thus, despite a poten -
tially sharp fall in the total hours worked in this 
sector, the number of persons working in low- 
income, part- time jobs will probably not fall by 
much. There could be a partial substitution of 
casual workers by workers subject to social se -curity contributions. Another possibility, how -
ever, is a shift towards other atypical forms of 
employment or a switch from regular activities 
to the shadow economy.
The level of unemployment is likely to change 
little over the forecast horizon. The number of 
unemployed persons registered in the statutory 
unemployment insurance system has moved 
closer to its frictional lower bound.13 Further -
more, the reduction in structural unemploy -Impact of  
the general 
 minimum wage on employment confined to cer-tain segmentsUnemployment virtually  unchangedassets. For calculating potential output, 
however, the trend of capital services used 
in the production process is relevant,7 and 
the conceptual change has had no signifi  -
cant impact on this. Capital services expand 
moderately during the projection horizon. 
Given the demographically induced un-
favourable outlook for the potential labour force, this indicates that the complementar-ity between the two primary factors of pro-
duction has a signifi  cant infl  uence. In any 
case, there are no signs of a marked rise in 
fi  xed capital formation in the longer run, 
which could be due, for instance, to enter-prises stepping up capital deepening in light 
of increasing labour shortages and the re-
sulting shifts in relative factor prices.
The estimate of potential output presented 
above is in line with the results of the Ger-
man Council of Economic Experts and the Joint Economic Forecast with regard to growth in aggregate potential output for the period between 2014 and 2016. Fur-
thermore, in line with the downward revi-
sion presented here, the economic research 
institutions likewise state that they have lowered their estimates compared with  previous calculations. The German Federal 
Government and the European Commission 
currently estimate potential growth over the forecast horizon at just over 1¼% per 
year.
7 In the estimation of potential output, the services 
that are generated by the capital used in the produc-
tion process in a given year are measured by weighting 
the available capital stocks, broken down by asset 
type, according to their user costs. See Deutsche Bun-
desbank, The changeover in capital measurement for 
potential output estimations, Monthly Report, April 
2012, pp 16-18, and T A Knetsch (2013), A user cost 
approach to capital measurement in aggregate pro-duction functions, Deutsche Bundesbank Discussion 
Paper No 01/ 2012.
12 The number of initial applications for political asylum 
has risen faster than overall (net) immigration in recent 
years. Whereas asylum seekers accounted for just under 
one- fifth of net immigrants in 2012, this ratio has probably 
risen to almost one- third in the meantime. This share is ex -
pected to rise again slightly in the coming years.
13 Weber ( Das Ziel der Vollbeschäftigung in Deutschland: 
Fern, aber erreichbar, IAB Kurzbericht 15/2014 ) estimates 
the minimum frictional unemployment rate at just under 
2½%. This matches the share of unemployed persons 
registered in the statutory unemployment insurance 
scheme. While not all insurees in the statutory unemploy -
ment insurance scheme have been out of work for just a 
short period of time, and not all welfare recipients capable 
of working are long-  term unemployed, the respective ex -
ceptions probably cancel each other out.Deutsche Bundesbank

ment brought about by labour market reforms 
over the past decade has probably largely 
petered out. The latest labour- market policy 
measures are more likely to hinder a further de -
cline in unemployment. The unemployment 
rate as defined by the Federal Employment 
Agency could consequently persist at around 
6.7%, while the unemployment rate as calcu -
lated according to international conventions 
could rise slightly from 5.1% in 2014 to 5.2% in 
both 2015 and 2016 owing to the introduction 
of the minimum wage.14
Labour costs and prices
The projected increase in negotiated wages 
takes account of all the collective agreements 
concluded in the past years and extrapolates 
them at the end of their contractual term in the 
light of the macroeconomic framework, cur -
rent wage demands and sector- specific fea -
tures. In the 2014 pay round, there were ini -
tially settlements with steep wage increases. As 
the pay round progressed, the settlements 
were increasingly marked by cautiousness. This 
was reflected, especially in the second half of 
2014, in longer contractual periods, zero 
months and lump- sum payments as well as 
comparatively low negotiated rates. Based on 
an average achievement rate of around one-  
half, the trade unions’ current demands for the 
forthcoming wage negotiations in the metal-  
working industry (+5½%) and in the chemicals 
industry (+4% to +5%) would suggest settle -
ments with an annual volume of less than 3%. 
Trade unions are therefore continuing to refrain 
from demanding excessive wage increases so 
as not to jeopardise well- paid jobs at firms that 
face international competition. In several ser -
vices sectors, intensified competitive conditions 
and structural adjustments are reducing profit 
margins and are consequently diminishing the 
prospect of high pay rises. As defined in the 
Bundesbank’s negotiated pay rate statistics, the 
increase in negotiated pay rates calculated 
from the wage settlements concluded to date 
and the extrapolated past wage settlements amounts to just over 3% for the current year, 
around 2½% for 2015 and just under 3% for 
2016. Compared with the June projection, this 
corresponds to a slight downward revision of 
the increase in negotiated wages across the 
entire forecast horizon.
The general statutory minimum wage, which 
will apply from 1 January 2015, will directly im -
pact the Bundesbank’s negotiated pay rate 
statistics only in exceptional cases. This is be -
cause the Bundesbank’s statistics are usually 
based on an agreed basic pay rate, which pre -
supposes completing vocational training and 
having several years of professional experience, 
whereas the minimum wage predominantly af -
fects segments with lower qualification require -
ments. Nevertheless, the introduction of a min -
imum wage is likely to strengthen the rise in 
actual earnings, especially in the coming year, 
but also in 2016. The possibility of being able 
to retire on a full pension at 63, which will 
cause the labour supply to contract, could add -2014 pay round

14 The minimum wage will presumably affect “mini- jobs” 
in particular. However, casual part- time workers employed 
in “mini- jobs” may concurrently be registered as un -
employed and therefore be included in the unemployment 
rate according to the national definition. If they lose their 
“mini- job”, there is no change in their status according to 
the national definition. According to international conven -
tions, by contrast, their status changes from “employed” to 
“unemployed”.Deutsche Bundesbank

itionally contribute to a positive wage drift. The 
high level of net immigration, by contrast, will 
have a countervailing effect. Changes to the 
social security contribution rates will also push 
up labour costs slightly in 2015 on balance. On 
the whole, the rise in labour costs – measured 
in terms of compensation per employee  – 
could go up from 2.6% to 3.0% in the forecast 
period.
The slightly stronger rise in labour costs could 
result in a moderate increase in domestically 
generated inflation – as measured by the GDP 
deflator – from 1.9% in 2014 to 2.0% in 2016. 
Given the merely gradual pick- up in economic 
growth, firms’ profit margins are likely to be 
compressed initially by the minimum wage-  
related cost surge before recovering again 
slightly under better economic conditions.
The increased upward pressure stemming from 
the domestic economy will make itself felt 
more strongly at the consumer level. Other de -terminants are also playing a role in this con -
text, however. Food prices will decline initially 
owing to an abundant supply. The price trend 
for food should, however, return to normal 
again next year. The prices of industrial goods 
(excluding energy) are likely to gradually feel 
the effects of the depreciating euro. It is not 
yet clear what impact the “mid- season sales”, 
which are visible in the official statistics for the 
first time this year, will have in the coming 
years.15 The prices of services are expected to 
pick up again. The new general minimum wage 
will also be a contributing factor here. Further -
more, the price reductions for package holidays 
owing to adjustment- related price cuts in a 
number of European holiday destinations will 
probably not be quite as pronounced as in the 
current year. Rents are also expected to go up 
at a faster pace. There are a growing number 
of reports which suggest that the upward trend 
in rents for new lettings is levelling off. How -
ever, given that rents for existing lettings, which 
predominate in the HICP , follow rents for new 
lettings with a time- lag, further upward price 
pressure may be expected for the time being. 
The overall rate of price increase (excluding en -
ergy) could climb from 1.2% in the current year 
to 2.0% in 2016.
Based on the technical assumptions for crude 
oil prices and exchange rates, a sharp decline is 
projected to be followed by a slight increase in 
prices for refined petroleum products (espe -
cially fuel and heating oil). Gas and heating 
prices usually follow these price movements 
with a certain time- lag and a reduced ampli -
tude. However, the relationship between gas 
and heating oil prices has loosened over the 
past few years owing to new supply sources. 
For the first time in 15 years, electricity will not 
be hit by sharp price hikes in the coming year.

power supply companies and to the somewhat

past year. Consumer prices are therefore likely 
to fall slightly, despite a further increase in grid 
charges. A renewed rise in electricity prices is, 
however, to be expected in 2016. On the 
whole, energy prices could fall by a further 
3.0% in 2015 after declining by 1.8% this year, 
before potentially rising again slightly by 0.5% 
in 2016.
Under these conditions, HICP inflation for Ger -
man consumers would amount to 0.9% in the 
current year, 1.1% in 2015 and 1.8% in 2016. 
Compared with the June projection, this repre -
sents a downward revision of 0.2 percentage 
point for 2014, 0.4 percentage point for 2015 
and 0.1 percentage point for 2016. Roughly 
half of these downward revisions are due to 
the developments on the crude oil markets be -
tween early August and mid- November, and 
the other half to weaker economic momen -
tum. Despite what remains a rather subdued 
overall tendency in Germany, these figures 
would be distinctly higher than the average 
rate of inflation in other euro- area countries.
Public finances
The general government budget looks set to 
improve slightly this year and consequently re -
cord a further surplus (2013: +0.1% of GDP). 
Revenue developments are robust owing, in 
part, to the higher dividend from the Bundes -
bank. On the expenditure side, the sharp in -
crease in pension and healthcare expenditure is 
making itself felt. However, interest expend -
iture is likely to contract again significantly, es -
pecially in light of the very favourable financing 
conditions, and, on the whole, a slight decline 
in the expenditure ratio is therefore likely.
As things currently stand, the fiscal balance 
looks set to deteriorate perceptibly in the com -
ing year and is likely to result in a (slight) deficit 
again. Revenue is likely to grow somewhat 
more slowly, mainly on account of the weaker 
economic momentum, whereas growth in ex -
penditure is likely to accelerate. Growth in so -cial security spending will probably remain high 
owing to the introduction of the pension bene -
fits package in mid-2014, the expansion in 
long- term care benefits and the barely curbed 
cost pressure in the healthcare system. Further -
more, it is to be expected that central govern -
ment’s plans to increase expenditure on the 
transport infrastructure, as well as in the areas 
of education and research, will have a marked 
impact on public finances. Lower interest ex -
penditure is likely to continue to provide a cer -
tain counterweight, however. This develop -
ment could be followed by a partial reversal in 
2016, leading to a balanced general govern -
ment budget. In particular, the anticipated 
brighter economic setting will boost revenue, 
while no further major budgetary cost- raising 
measures are planned at present.
In view of the anticipated course of economic 
development, the impact of cyclical factors on 
government budgets is expected to be neutral 
in the current year and in 2015 and slightly 
positive in 2016.16 The structural balance will 
also be virtually balanced at the end of the 
forecast period, but will temporarily fall back 
into negative territory in 2015. This is due to a 
marked loosening of fiscal policy in the coming 
year, in other words a deterioration in the cyc -
lically adjusted primary balance, which is partly 
being masked by falling interest costs. The 
main reason for this is the strong growth in so -
cial security expenditure with barely any change 
overall in contribution rates. This will result in 
deficits and a decline in the currently high level 
of reserves. Central, state and local govern -
ments could also ease their fiscal course slightly.

areas regarded as having priority. Whereas 
those state governments which still have a re -
maining need for consolidation are doing so 
only slowly, state and local governments with 
surpluses in their budgets might perceptibly 
step up, not least, their investment expend -
iture.
The debt ratio could fall clearly below 70% by 
2016, but is still likely to remain well above the 
60% ceiling (2013: 76.9%). The decline is due 
chiefly to nominal GDP growth in the denomin -
ator. Furthermore, the claims and thus also the 
liabilities of government- owned bad banks 
should be reduced further. The assistance loans 
granted to euro-  area countries and the trans -
fers to the European Stability Mechanism are 
again pushing up debt this year.Risk assessment
Between the time that this projection was final -
ised and the cut- off date for this projection re -
port, Brent futures have declined across the en -
tire maturity range, falling by an average of 
11%.17 This is due primarily to the fact that 
OPEC does not appear to be performing its 
price- stabilising role at present and is refraining 
from reducing its production quotas. A reduc -
tion in crude oil prices on this scale could po -
tentially have considerable macroeconomic im -
plications. It would directly reduce the cost of 
living for households and also companies’ pro -
duction costs, thereby freeing up funds for 
other purposes. The decline in oil prices there -
fore suggests the need for a downward revi -
sion of the inflation forecast and an upward 
revision of the GDP growth forecast. If crude oil 
prices remain at this subdued level for an ex -
tended period of time, the forecast of the HICP 
rate would, according to model calculations, 
have to be revised downwards by 0.4 percent -
age point for the coming year. The inflation 
rate could also be somewhat weaker this year 
and also in 2016, although the effect would be 
much less pronounced. Looking at economic 
growth, both 2015 and 2016 could expect to 
see positive effects of 0.1 to 0.2 percentage 
point. The benefits for the German economy 
could be even greater if the fall in oil prices has 
a correspondingly marked stimulating effect on 
the global economy.
As in June, the present projection assumes that 
world trade is picking up momentum again and 
that the economic recovery in the euro area is 
gaining in strength. The expectations have 
been lowered significantly compared to the 
June projection, however, with the result that 
potential downside risks no longer appear to 
be quite so dominant. Even so, the heightened 
geopolitical tensions continue to present a sig -
nificant risk. Furthermore, there is still the dan -
ger of abrupt adjustment processes stemming Debt ratio

from the financial markets in a number of the 
emerging market economies. And lastly, the 
nascent recovery in the euro area is still fragile 
and needs to be bolstered further by economic 
policy reform measures. Should the path of ex -
ports, which was derived from the assumptions 
about sales market growth, prove to be too 
optimistic, this would also have implications for 
investment in the corporate sector.
Despite the significant forecast errors in the 
second and third quarters of this year, it is as -
sumed that investment in residential housing 
construction will increase significantly over the 
forecast period. This presupposes, among other 
things, that rising immigration will trigger add -
itional demand for housing and that the inter -
vention by legislators in the housing market is 
not deterring private investors. By contrast, pri -
vate consumption could pick up somewhat 
more strongly if, in the light of the ageing 
population and low real interest rates, people 
show a higher preference for current consump -
tion.
A distinction needs to be drawn between ex -
ternal and domestic risks also with respect to 
the price projection. This first raises the ques -
tion of whether the only slight upward path in 
crude oil prices, from an already depressed 
level, derived from forward prices is consistent with a scenario of robust global economic 
growth. A slightly steeper path for crude oil 
prices could raise the HICP rate, especially in 
2016. This also holds true in the event of a 
 further depreciation of the euro, which could 
result from the implementation of the an -
nounced monetary policy measures, on the 
one hand, and the emerging normalisation of 
the monetary policy stance in the United States, 
on the other. Thus, the HICP rate appears to be 
faced with upside risks from the external set -
ting, especially for 2016. The very depressed 
price trend in the euro area has also left a dis -
tinct mark on consumer prices in Germany of 
late. This trend could continue to a greater ex -
tent than assumed in this forecast and would 
constitute a downward risk. The degree to 
which price inflation is being driven domestic -
ally is dictated primarily by the extent of short -
ages in the labour market and the related wage 
dynamics. The influx of immigrants has so far 
been easing the supply shortages on the Ger -
man labour market, and both the increase in 
wages as well as domestically generated infla -
tion appear to be somewhat weaker than pre -
viously anticipated. This trend could continue 
for quite some time to come. The new general 
statutory minimum wage could, however, also 
make a greater contribution to price inflation 
than assumed in this forecast.Domestic risks

German enterprises’ profitability and 
 financing in 2013
The profitability of German non- financial corporations for 2013 as a whole was not quite as good 
as that in the first three years after overcoming the severe recession of 2009. Pre- tax profits 
amounted to only 4% of sales in the reporting year, compared with 4¼% in the years 2010 to 
2012. Against a backdrop of stagnating sales income, this was due primarily to the considerably 
higher personnel expenses. This cost factor rose in some parts of the manufacturing industry in 
particular, whereas sales recovered only gradually following the temporary lull in the fourth quar -
ter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013. Personnel expenses were up not only on account of 
negotiated pay rises, however, but also because industrial enterprises were continuing to expand 
their workforce despite the weak economic activity. This may be interpreted as an indication of 
staff planning geared to the medium to long term. The expansion strategy is particularly notice -
able in the manufacture of transport equipment, especially as there was also a sharp rise in fixed 
assets in this area.
On the other hand, increases in tangible fixed assets throughout the non- financial corporate sec -
tor remained moderate in 2013, as in the previous years. The acquisition of other long- term equity 
investments was also down in the reporting period, whereas such transactions were numerous in 
2012. Exceptions here were car manufacturers as well as energy and water supply companies, 
which raised their holdings substantially. The need for long- term debt financing remained limited, 
not least because of the broadened scope for internal funding. It became necessary to step up 
provisions for pensions given the low level of interest rates.
The marked improvement in economic activity during 2013 is reflected in the movements of inven -
tories and financial current assets. Output was stepped up in the manufacturing sector; as a 
result, warehouses were less full as at the reporting date than one year earlier, and finished 
goods went on sale quickly, particularly towards the end of the year. This was one of the reasons 
why cash was higher, whereas trade receivables did not increase. This suggests a tendency to 
give preference to shorter credit terms for the supply of goods and services, due probably, not 
least, to the very low interest rates.
Enterprises were endeavouring again in 2013 to consolidate their equity capital base further. This 
was particularly true of small and medium- sized enterprises, whose capital ratio was 3 percent -
age points below the average of 28% across size categories and economic sectors. In contrast, 
large firms have been increasing their equity in step with total assets since 2010; their equity ratio 
is hovering at just below the 30% mark. However, it appears unlikely that this ratio will be main -
tained in the current year. In any event, according to preliminary information from the consoli -
dated financial statements statistics, the increase in the equity capital base of listed non- financial 
groups was failing to keep pace with balance sheet growth up to the end of the third quarter of 
2014. Furthermore, latest group data suggest that profitability in the corporate sector as a whole 
is likely to have benefited in the current year from the decline in prices of raw materials and inter -
mediate goods.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report  
December 2014

Underlying trends
German economic activity grew at a fairly lively 
pace during the course of 2013, and gross do -
mestic product (GDP) was 1.1% higher in the 
fourth quarter of 2013 than one year earlier. 
However, in light of the downturn in the fourth 
quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013, 
economic output on an annual average was a 
mere 0.1% above the previous year’s level. This 
is consistent with the fact that non- financial 
corporations hardly succeeded in raising their 
2013 sales as a whole compared with 2012.1 
There were substantial sectoral differences in 
this context. The manufacturing sector was un -
able in 2013 to maintain the sales volume re -
corded in 2012 owing to a temporary dearth of 
demand. In contrast, domestically oriented sec -
tors of the economy such as construction again 
generated strong growth. The sectoral differ -
ences are less pronounced in terms of gross in -
come, which is gross revenue less cost of ma -
terials. This suggests that enterprises were 
often able to balance their buying and selling 
activities through their pricing and their busi -
ness arrangements. In contrast, the growth in 
personnel expenses in some areas was less in 
keeping with sales results. Notably in industry, 
expenditure for permanent employees saw the 
sharpest increase compared with other sectors; 
on the other hand, the industry- related services 
sector, which also fell behind for cyclical rea -
sons, and the flourishing construction sector 
succeeded in curbing growth in personnel ex -
penses.
Substantial declines in profit in the manufactur -
ing sector were the main reason why the prof -
itability of the non- financial corporate sector as 
a whole, at 4%, fell slightly short of the 2012 
level. The profitability of car manufacturers in 
particular was impaired by higher costs. On the 
other hand, construction and a number of ser -
vices sectors generated a leap in income. Firms 
from the construction and business services 
sectors were among the most profitable in 
2013 on a sectoral average.Despite lower profits, a decline in depreciation 
and a sharp build- up of provisions, the cash 
flow of non- financial corporations grew on the 
whole in 2013. External funding was down on 
the previous year; this was linked primarily to 
the fact that enterprises incurred new long-  
term liabilities to a lesser extent. Once again, 
they were reticent to take out bank loans, 
whereas the volume of newly issued bonds and 
capital injections remained more or less at the 
previous year’s levels.
The moderate step- up in demand for long- term 
funding is consistent, on the one hand, with 
the fact that fixed capital formation again 
proved to be relatively weak in 2013. The share 
of total assets accounted for by tangible fixed 
assets decreased further. On the other hand, 
the increase in holdings of other long- term 
equity investments was comparatively weak 
compared with the steep growth recorded be -
tween 2010 and 2012. In strongly intercon -
nected sectors such as manufacturing and the 
information and communication industry, the 
share of total assets accounted for by other 
long- term equity investments was even smaller 
in the reporting period than in the previous 
year. Most enterprises experienced markedly 
improved underlying economic conditions on 
the balance sheet date of 2013 compared with 
one year earlier. This was evident from the 
changes in the balance sheet items which are 
sensitive to short- term changes in cyclical con -
ditions.2 At the end of 2013, warehouse stocks 
were somewhat lower than in 2012, whereas 
industrial and construction firms reported sig -
nificantly more work in progress (semi- finished 
products and services).Sales in 2013

Non- financial corporations stuck to their strat -
egy of building up their own funds. As a ratio 
of total assets, their equity rose to a new re -
cord level of 28%, which was ¼ percentage 
point above the previous year. As in the past, 
equity ratios tended to climb primarily in those 
sectors that were still lagging behind the aver -
age of all the economic sectors considered. 
This applies in particular to the construction in -
dustry, some trade sectors, accommodation 
and food service activities as well as the trans -
portation and storage sector. The trend to -
wards scaling back bank loans, which has been 
visible for quite some time, was likewise con -
tinued. Instead, liabilities to affiliated com -
panies again saw substantial growth.
Corporate insolvencies dropped once again in 
2013. As a whole, the non- financial corporate 
sector coped well with the temporary cyclical 
downturn given the sound financing situation. 
Only in the mining sector and in electricity, gas 
and water supply did more firms become in -
solvent in 2013 than in 2012. In manufacturing, 
which was most strongly affected by the eco -
nomic headwinds of the last quarter of 2012 
and the first quarter of 2013, the number of 
business closures was virtually unchanged. The 
buoyant construction activity meant that the 
number of businesses that became insolvent in 
this sector declined markedly. The robust do -
mestic activity probably played a key part in the 
renewed decrease in the insolvency rate among 
business- related service providers and in the 
transportation and storage sector.
Sales and income
Non- financial corporate sector 
as a whole
The growth in sales generated by non- financial 
corporations almost ground to a halt in 2013 
(+½%) following a marked decline in 2012 
compared to the very strong growth recorded 
at the beginning of the current upswing. The 
rise in total sales revenue, which comprises sales from operating business as well as income 
from financial linkages and investments, even 
proved to be somewhat lower still. Although 
income from other long- term equity invest -
ments saw a considerable increase, the return 
on interest- bearing assets in 2013 was again 
markedly lower year on year.
The rise in prices of raw materials and inter -
mediate goods weakened almost to the same 
extent as sales revenue. One reason for this 
was that the import prices of raw materials and 
semi- finished products fell by 7% in the report -
ing year after climbing sharply in the years 
2010 to 2012. At the domestic producer level, 
too, intermediate goods were somewhat 
cheaper in 2013 than in 2012 (-1%). In contrast, 
personnel expenses remained an expansive 
cost factor, although the increase in 2013 
(2¾%) was not as pronounced as in the period 
2010-12 (4¼% on average). Collective wage 
and salary increases in the non- financial cor -
porate sector under consideration here, 
amounting to 2½%, were slightly lower in the 
reporting period than in 2012 (2¾%); more -
over, voluntary one-  off payments were prob -
ably less generous than in the previous years. 
At the same time, enterprises expanded their 
workforce further to a significant extent. This 
was apparently driven by staff planning geared 
to the medium to long term; however, these 
measures went hand in hand with losses in in -
come for the 2013 financial year as a result of 
subdued business developments.
Depreciation fell somewhat overall. This was 
mainly due to the decrease in scheduled depre -
ciation of tangible fixed assets. The need for 
special depreciation was substantially greater in 
2013 than in 2012, but again did not have 
much impact. Provisioning for current and 
 financial assets was again fairly moderate after 
two years with somewhat higher reductions. 
Enterprises’ interest and similar expenses 
dipped only slightly below the very low level 
recorded in 2012.Strengthening of

The non- financial corporate sector’s profits fell 
somewhat in 2013 for the first time since the 
recession year of 2009 in the context of stag -
nating sales, primarily because of the continued 
marked rise in personnel expenses. Pre-  tax in -
come was almost 3½% lower than in 2012. 
The return on sales in the reporting period 
reached 4% as an average for all sectors. This 
was around ¼ percentage point less than in 
the previous two years.
Sectoral trends
As an average for 2013, the manufacturing sec -
tor was not quite able to match the level of 
sales seen in 2012 (-½%). Moreover, the rise in 
personnel expenses was again stronger here 
than in all other sectors. In this respect, the ne -
gotiated wage increases, which amounted to 
just over 3% in this sector, are likely to have 
had a greater impact than the renewed in -
creases in staffing levels. Profits in this sector 
were down by one- seventh on average. In the 
year under review, the return on sales of just 
under 4% was ¾ percentage point lower than 
in the years 2010 to 2012, and was this time 
slightly below the average for non- financial 
corporations.
In 2013, vehicle manufacturers were burdened, 
above all, by surging costs. Given the relatively 
robust growth in sales (+2%), they would have 
been well able to cope with the marked in -
crease in the cost of materials (+3%). However, 
the automotive industry and manufacturers of 
other transport equipment created a remark -
able number of new jobs subject to social se -
curity contributions (+2¾% and +6¼% re -
spectively). Viewed in connection with the re -
newed fairly sharp additions to tangible fixed 
assets, this suggests that enterprises stepped 
up production capacity at German locations. 
However, the growth in staff may have been 
partly attributable to the fact that, following 
the introduction of sectoral wage add- ons in 
November 2012, the use of temporary staff, 
who in employment statistics are assigned to Return on sales

the services sector, grew less attractive than re -
cruiting permanent staff. The item “Other ex -
penses”, which also includes pay for temporary 
staff, was lower in this sector as a whole, as 
opposed to the corporate sector; this can at 
any rate be interpreted as further indication of 
a decline in temporary agency employment. 
Employment growth and negotiated wage rises 
served to push up personnel expenses consid -
erably (+4½%). Furthermore, depreciation as 
well as interest and similar expenses likewise 
saw an increase in this sector, bucking the sec -
toral trend. In addition to the unfavourable 
trend in cost-  earnings ratios in operational 
business, vehicle manufacturers sustained sub -stantial drops in income from other long- term 
equity investments. On balance, their pre- tax 
profits were halved year on year. In the report -
ing period, the return on sales was particularly 
meagre at 1½%, compared with 3½% in the 
previous two years.
The decrease in income remained within limits 
in other branches of the capital goods sector, 
however. The cost of materials contracted in 
the electrical and mechanical engineering sec -
tors while sales were largely stable, and the rise 
in employment subject to social security contri -
butions was comparatively small. The mechan -
ical engineering sector was able to limit growth In contrast, elec-

in personnel expenses (+2%), unlike manufac -
turers of computers, electronic products and 
electrical equipment (+4½%). However, depre -
ciation as well as interest and similar expenses 
were down significantly in the latter sectors. 
On balance, both industrial sectors achieved an 
impressive pre- tax return of around 5½%.
Within the manufacturing sector, the chemical 
industry usually generates the highest income 
measured by sales. In 2013, it maintained the 
previous year’s result, and the return remained 
at 7½%. However, this result was markedly 
lower than in 2010 and 2011 (9%) and matched 
the figure of 2009, the year of the recession. 
With sales more or less constant since 2011, 
the cost of materials provided discernible relief 
in the reporting period as the prices of raw ma -
terials subsided (-2%). Negotiated wage in -
creases in this industry were somewhat more 
moderate than in the metalworking industry; 
this probably also played a key part in the 
somewhat more modest rise in personnel 
 expenses (+1½%). In contrast, the other major 
branch of the intermediate goods sector, the 
metal production and processing industry, was 
affected by sharply increasing personnel ex -
penses, much like the capital goods sector. This 
had the effect of  reducing income further. The 
ratio of income to sales, which were down 
 appreciably, was a mere 3½% in 2013, com -
pared with 4% in 2012 and 4½% in 2011.
For the construction sector, 2013 marked an -
other record year. Sales advanced by 3½%, and 
income before taxes surged by one- fifth. Unlike 
in the manufacturing sector, the cost of mater -
ials went up markedly, whereas personnel ex -
penses saw a less strong increase even though 
employment growth was up. Comparatively 
moderate negotiated wage increases are likely 
to have benefited construction firms in this re -
spect. On the whole, the construction sector 
achieved a return on sales of 6½% before taxes 
in 2013. This was around ¾ percentage point 
more than in the previous two years.In 2013, energy and water supply companies 
generated a growth in sales from operating 
business of 3½%. As a result, this sector and 
construction recorded the highest levels of the 
non- financial corporate sector. However, in -
come from other long- term equity investments 
and from long- term financial assets fell short of 
the previous year’s result. The cost of materials 
was higher, causing pressure on the expenses 
side. Furthermore, depreciation was up, while 
interest and similar expenses rose substantially, 
not least in view of the large number of activ -
ities related to other long- term equity invest -
ments that evidently called for a higher share 
of debt financing (+4½%). The pre- tax profits 
of energy and water supply companies receded 
by one- fifth in the reporting period compared 
with 2012. The return on sales declined by 
¾ percentage point to 2¾%, the sector’s prof -
itability having recovered only partially from the 
blow it received in 2011 in connection with the 
phasing- out of nuclear energy.
In 2013, wholesale trade suffered a moderate 
drop in sales (-1%) caused by the industrial 
downturn. Nor were motor vehicle traders able 
to maintain the previous year’s sales level. Re -
tailers fared better, with sales rising by 1½% on 
the back of robust consumer demand. Taking 
into account the procurement side, the differ -
ences between the individual branches of the 
retail trade were slightly smaller. However, the 
trend in personnel expenses was crucial to how 
income developed in each case. The motor ve -
hicle trade scaled back its expenses for person -
nel moderately, whereas wholesale and retail 
trade enterprises experienced increases of up 
to 2%. On the whole, the trade sectors con -
verged somewhat in terms of their return on 
sales. Retailers once again generated by far the 
best return on sales (3¾%) in this economic 
sector in 2013, while motor vehicle traders 
drew level with the wholesale sector (2½% 
each).

sales growth in 2013. The increases in expend -
iture did remain moderate on the whole, how -
ever. Amidst a sharp decline in depreciation, 
information and communication enterprises 
even succeeded in maintaining the result be -
fore taxes, and achieved a very high return on 
sales (+6½%) compared with the other sectors. 
In this respect they were surpassed only by 
business services providers, which were able to 
push their profits up by one- sixth as sales grew 
by 2%. In relation to sales, the income they 
generated in 2013 came to 9½%. The transport 
and storage sector came last in terms of profit -
ability. However, because costs were un -
changed while sales rose somewhat, profits in 
the reporting period were not quite as weak as 
in the previous years. With a return on sales of 
2¾%, this branch roughly drew level with the 
trade sectors.
Sources and uses of funds
Sources of funds of non- financial corporations 
persisted at their 2012 level, which is thus con -
sistent with the picture of weak investment ac -
tivity overall. In contrast to the year before, 
however, the cash flow in 2013 was perceptibly 
higher again (+5%), which meant that enter -
prises were able to make greater use of internal 
sources of funding. Given a further decline in 
profit retention and decreasing depreciation, 
this increased scope was reflected in an accel -
erated reduction of provisions. In terms of ex -
ternal financing, three- quarters of companies’ 
funds during the reporting period were raised 
by the assumption of liabilities. Additional li -
abilities were incurred, above all, to affiliated 
companies. Long- term bank loans were re -
deemed on balance, while short- term bank 
loans were expanded somewhat. The issuance 
of long- term bonds in 2013 almost matched its 
2012 level, which was the first time after 2009 
that a significant issuance volume was achieved. 
Injections of equity during the reporting period 
showed a slight increase on 2012.In 2013, as in the two preceding years, almost 
three- fifths of available resources were used for 
tangible fixed assets. For non- financial corpor -
ations, increases in tangible fixed assets were, 
on average, only 9% above the corresponding 
volume of depreciation, compared with figures 
of +17% in 2011 and +11% in 2012. Despite 
extremely positive sectoral activity in 2013, the 
value of new equipment procured in the con -
struction sector was only 5% higher than de -
preciation. The figures for the two preceding 
years, in the context of a high level of capacity 
utilisation, both showed an increase of roughly 
one- quarter. It was not possible to identify any 
substantial accumulation of tangible fixed 
assets during the reporting period even in the 
services sector, which was a beneficiary of cyc -
lical activity. In manufacturing, the sectors that 
stood out in 2013 were those which had al -
ready invested heavily in fixed assets in 2012. 
Increases in tangible fixed assets in the manu -
facture of transport equipment were almost 
half as large again as the volume of depreci -
ation, compared with just over one- third in 
2012. In the manufacture of basic metals, fixed 
investment was 25% higher than depreciation, 
which was down on the 2012 level, but still 
clearly above the mean value for the manufac -
turing sector (17%).
Among the sectors that possess major equity 
holdings, electricity, gas and water supply was 
the sole sector to make a further considerable 
expansion in this item during the reporting 
period. As the utilities sector also conducted 
fixed investment on a sizeable scale, they made 
increased use of external financing. Strong new 
capital injections are not unusual in this con -
nection; what is surprising is the increase in 
short- term, as opposed to long- term liabilities. 
In the manufacture of transport equipment, 
equity investments expanded in the context of 
a substantial accumulation of tangible fixed 
assets. Chemicals, electrical engineering and 
communications enterprises, on the other 
hand, were restrained in terms of acquiring 
new long- term equity investments.Information and 
communication sector as well as business services again post strong return; transport sector improves, but still rather weak

Balance sheet developments
Total assets of the non-  financial corporations 
sector expanded by 3% in 2013, as in 2012. On 
the assets side, there was a sharp expansion in 
long- term receivables from affiliated com -
panies, while growth in equity investments was 
no longer as marked as in the preceding years. 
A considerable increase in cash in conjunction 
with inventories that were scarcely higher is an 
indication that enterprises’ sales were strong, 
especially at the end of the reporting period. 
Furthermore, a part was played by the fact that 
some large enterprises issued bonds on a large 
scale at the end of 2013, but had not yet used the resulting inflows of funds by the reporting 
date. Enterprises’ continuing reluctance to in -
vest led to a no more than moderate increase 
in tangible fixed assets with a consequent slight 
reduction in their share of total assets. As had 
been the case in previous years, on the liabil -
ities side, liabilities and provisions failed to keep 
pace with the expansion of equity. Above all, 
there was a further reduction in liabilities to 
credit institutions, whereas there was another 
increase in liabilities to affiliated companies. In 
addition, enterprises formed more provisions 
again in 2013. This was due mainly to a marked 
increase in provisions for pensions made neces -Further moder-

sary, among other things, by the low-  interest 
rate setting.
The marked improvement in industrial activity 
over the course of 2013 is reflected in the in -
ventories and financial current assets of the 
manufacturing sector. Production was stepped 
up in comparison with in late 2012 and early 
2013, resulting in inventories of materials being 
lower than one year earlier. By contrast, more 
work- in- progress was shown on the balance 
sheet. Finished goods were quickly up for sale, 
especially towards the end of the balance sheet 
reporting period. This was not the sole reason 
for the sharp increase in cash balances, how -ever. Industrial enterprises’ customers were 
also evidently quick to pay outstanding in -
voices. This is indicated by the fact that there 
was no increase in trade receivables. The same 
lines of development can be seen in the whole -
sale and motor vehicle trades. Given very low 
interest rates, buyers do not seem to have been 
concerned with taking greater advantage of 
credit terms for goods received. In the con -
struction sector, many enterprises were operat -
ing at their capacity limits in 2013 again amid 
unchanged positive demand conditions. This is 
evidenced not only by the strongly increased 
cash balances and trade receivables, but also Tendencies in

by a further rise in construction projects in pro -
gress shown on the balance sheet.
In the reporting period, there was again a 
moderate build- up of fixed assets used in the 
context of manufacturing or business oper -
ations, though their share of the balance sheet 
total declined again somewhat, amounting to 
an average of 23½% for the non- financial cor -
porations sector in 2013. Firms invested primar -
ily in movable assets. As in previous years, the 
acquisition of tangible fixed assets was espe -
cially marked in the manufacture of transport 
equipment. At production facilities in Germany, 
there was an expansion of one- tenth in inven -tories of machinery and equipment as well in 
the related industrial or commercial space used. 
In the case of the major German car manufac -
turers, the average increase in tangible fixed 
assets was even higher. The fact that there was 
a simultaneous build- up of new plants and/or 
an expansion of existing ones in the Far East 
and the United States is testimony to an overall 
strategy of expansion at home and abroad.
Manufacture of transport equipment was the 
only industrial sector with substantial equity in -
vestments that saw further increases in this 
item in 2013 as well. The chemical and elec -
trical engineering sectors reduced their equity 
interests on balance. In manufacturing as a 
whole, there was something of a decline in the 
weight of equity investments as part of total 
assets; this followed a sharp increase in the 
three preceding years. Individual enterprises of 
the information and communication sectors 
also exercised restraint, while energy and water 
suppliers expanded their equity investments by 
one- third. Given this heterogeneous sectoral 
profile, acquisition of equity interests by the 
non- financial corporations sector remained 
subdued overall. This contrasted in 2013 with a 
sharp expansion in long- term receivables from 
affiliated companies; in comparison with equity 
capital and in terms of the weight of total 
assets, however, this is the significantly smaller 
item of long- term financial linkages between 
enterprises. Enterprises also increased their se -
curities holdings again for the first time since 
2009 after reducing them sharply in the wake 
of the financial crisis. Overall, fixed assets still 
accounted for 44½% of total assets.
The slow pace of growth in fixed assets was 
accompanied by a small increase in long- term 
equity on the liabilities side. Its share of total 
assets went up to 48½% in the reporting 
period. Non- financial corporations made a fur -
ther reduction in their long- term liabilities to 
credit institutions in 2013, resulting in their 
share of total assets (7%) falling to an all- time 
low since the Bundesbank began analysing en -
terprises’ balance sheets. By contrast, enter -Growth in

prises relied more on intra- group sources of 
funding as well as additional issuance of debt, 
which – as in the previous year – they stepped 
up by more than one- fifth.
For the economic sectors under consideration, 
the share of equity in total assets amounted, 
on average, to 28% at the end of the 2013 
 financial year. The long- term trend towards 
strengthening the capital base has therefore 
been continuing in the non- financial corpor -
ations sector.3 It was chiefly small and medium- 
sized enterprises (SMEs) that expanded their 
equity more sharply than their liabilities and 
provisions. At 25%, the share of equity in the 
total assets of SMEs is still below- average, 
however. Large enterprises have been increas -
ing their equity in step with total assets since 
2010; their capital ratio has settled at just 
below the 30% mark. In the manufacturing 
sector, the equity ratio persisted at a slightly 
above-  average level in 2013. The construction 
sector has been using the good years for busi -
ness so far to further improve its capital ad -
equacy. In the retail and motor vehicle trades as 
well as in transport enterprises, the growth in 
equity capital was larger than the expansion in 
total assets. There was no improvement in this 
respect, however, in the information and com -
munication sector or in the case of business 
services.
Trends for 2014
Non- financial corporations’ business perform -
ance is likely to be moderate again in 2014. 
One indication of this is that, according to the 
provisional figures of the consolidated financial 
statement statistics4 up to the third quarter of 
2014, sales of listed non- financial groups were 
no more than ½% up on the year. Corporate 
groups’ profitability has shown a distinct im -
provement, however. The increase of roughly 
one- tenth nevertheless has to be seen in the 
context of depressed profits in the previous 
year. For the non- financial corporations sector 
as a whole, where volatility in earnings is gen -erally less pronounced, growth on this scale is 
not to be expected. Even so, the profits situ -
ation in 2014 may have shown an improve -
ment on the previous year. This is suggested 
primarily by a further easing of prices for raw 
materials and intermediate goods. Staff costs, 
on the other hand, are likely to have shown a 
further increase against a backdrop of rising Continued

employment and widespread substantial in -
creases in negotiated rates of pay.
Corporate groups’ tangible fixed assets at the 
end of the third quarter of 2014 amounted to 
just under 26% of total assets, as they did in 
2013. The fact that the corporate sector’s reluc -
tance to invest has not yet been overcome is 
consistent with this year’s macroeconomic en -
vironment. The equity capital of the commer -
cial and industrial corporate groups at 30 Sep -
tember 2014 was 1½% up on the year. This 
moderate increase was partly due to the fact 
that enterprises had to increase their provisions 
for pensions owing to a further decline in the 
applied rate of interest; in consolidated ac -
counting, this entails a lowering of the other 
reserves, which has a negative impact on 
equity.5 Total assets, which were up more than 5%, increased considerably more strongly. The 
outcome of this is that corporate groups saw 
an identifiable reduction in their equity ratio in 
2014 for the first time since the severe reces -
sion of 2009. When analysing trends in the 
non- financial corporations sector as whole, it 
should nevertheless be borne in mind that, es -
pecially over the past five years, it is SMEs that 
have made the largest contribution to a sus -
tained strengthening of the equity ratio, while 
large enterprises have shown no further im -
provements in this respect.
Long series of extrapolated results from the corporate financial statement statistics are available
