Economic conditions
Underlying trends
The German economy is gradually recovering 
from its severe slump in the wake of the 
coronavirus pandemic. The progressive easing 
of the constraints on economic and social life 
led to economic activity picking up from May 
2020 onwards. This catch-  up movement con -
tinued in July and probably also in August, 
albeit  with waning momentum. The massive 
seasonally adjusted decline in gross domestic 
product (GDP) in spring of almost one- tenth on 
the quarter is likely to be followed by a strong 
countermovement in the third quarter of 2020. 
Nevertheless, the third quarter will still be sig -
nificantly down on the level before the crisis. 
This applies equally to industry and to services 
as a whole.
The recovery is likely to continue over the 
course of the year, albeit at a slower pace. In 
the industrial sector, enterprises are looking 
with greater optimism to the future again, with 
the majority expecting to step up their produc -
tion again in the coming months, according to 
the results of the Ifo business survey. However, 
expectations regarding export business are still 
subdued and the inflow of orders was percep -
tibly losing momentum towards the end of the 
period under review. Various restrictions remain 
in place in the case of services, and activity is 
still significantly below its pre- crisis level in 
many areas. This is particularly true of the hotel 
and restaurant sector and of many leisure and 
cultural services. Moreover, the GfK consumer 
climate index shows that –  after showing a 
marked recovery  – consumer sentiment suf -
fered a setback in August owing to reduced in -
come prospects. Another factor in this may 
have been that rising infection rates and con -
cerns about a renewed tightening of contain -
ment measures were weighing on consumer 
sentiment at the time of the survey.Industry
German industry continued its recovery in July 
2020, although the catch- up movement in in -
dustrial production was clearly losing momen -
tum. Owing to the rapid pace of growth in the 
two preceding months, there was nevertheless 
a strong increase compared with the average 
of the second quarter (+13½%). While this 
meant that there was a further narrowing of 
the gap compared with the pre- crisis level, the 
shortfall was still significant. Seasonally ad -
justed industrial output in the reporting month 
was around one- tenth lower than the average 
of the fourth quarter of 2019. At the beginning 
of the third quarter, the decline was particularly 
large in the case of capital goods with the 
automotive sector being most affected. A 
markedly smaller decrease was registered by 
manufacturers of consumer goods, who also 
had smaller losses to cope with in April, how -
ever.
In July 2020, new orders in German industry 
showed a profile similar to that of output. In 
seasonally adjusted terms, demand for German 
industrial products showed a further rise 
(+2¾%) compared with the previous month, 
the figure for which has been revised upwards 
somewhat. This meant that the increase was 
far smaller than in May and June (+10½% and 
+28¾%). Compared with the strongly de -
pressed second quarter overall, a significant im -
provement was recorded in the reporting 
month (+24½%). Broken down by sector, de -
mand in the capital goods sector rose particu -
larly sharply compared with the second quarter, 
although it should be borne in mind that this 
industry also had to cope with the largest de -
cline in the second quarter. In a regional break -
down, the growth in domestic demand com -
pared with the second quarter (+12½%) was 
markedly smaller than the corresponding in -
crease in demand for exports (+34½%). In this 
regional comparison, the strong inflow of German eco -

large- scale domestic orders in June was, to a 
considerable extent, the key factor. Excluding 
large orders, the gap was very much smaller. 
Compared with the level in the final quarter of 
2019, German industrial enterprises received 
only 5½% fewer domestic orders and 6½% 
fewer export orders in July.
There was a further rise in nominal industrial 
turnover in July 2020, although there was also 
a slowdown in the pace of recovery, albeit not 
quite as strong as in the case of production. 
Following the marked growth in May and June 
(+9½% and +13% respectively), seasonally ad -
justed sales continued to rise perceptibly on the 
month (+5¼%). Compared with the previous 
quarter, which had been marked by the down -
turn in April, growth was significantly higher 
still (+17%). Broken down by sector, the in -
crease in turnover was due mainly to a strong 
countermovement in sales of capital goods 
(+32½%). In this context, the catch- up move -
ment in the automotive sector – following the 
dramatic slump in April – stood out in particu -
lar. From a regional perspective, sales to export 
customers rose more strongly than those to 
domestic business partners (+21½% and 
+13¼% respectively), although there had also 
been a more distinct decline in export sales in 
the second quarter. In line with industrial sales, 
nominal exports of goods in July 2020 showed 
a marked increase on the month in seasonally 
adjusted terms (+4¾%), and were also well up 
on the average of the second quarter (+17% in 
both real and nominal terms). In price- adjusted 
terms, deliveries of goods in July were more 
than one- tenth below their average in the 
fourth quarter of 2019. Imports of goods have 
shown a profile similar to that of exports of 
goods in recent months, with the decline in 
April and the subsequent recovery being less 
pronounced than in the case of exports. In July, 
however, imports were still down considerably 
on the final quarter of 2019 (8% after price ad -
justment).Continued

Construction
Compared with other sectors, the construction 
sector has so far been relatively unaffected by 
the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis. 
A case in point is indicated by utilisation of ma -
chinery in the main construction sector, which, 
according to the ifo Institute, was still signifi -
cantly higher than its long- term average in 
August  2020. Seasonally adjusted construction 
output in July fell by a quite significant 4¼% on 
the month and was also well down on the 
average of the second quarter (-2¾%). How -
ever, this was due mainly to the sharp decline 
in the finishing trades (-5%), where the initial 
data on output are very prone to revision. By 
contrast, activity in the main construction sec -
tor was only slightly lower (-½%), although 
new orders in the second quarter – statistical 
data are available up to then – fell markedly in 
seasonally adjusted terms compared with the 
previous quarter (-6¾%).
Labour market
The labour market is showing first signs of re -
covery. Employment rose slightly in July 2020 
for the first time since the start of the pan -
demic, following the sharp decline since March. 
The number of persons in work in Germany in -
creased by 53,000, or 0.1%, on the month in 
seasonally adjusted terms, with something of a 
recovery evident in both part- time low- paid 
work and jobs subject to social security contri -
butions. In particular, some previously hard- hit 
services sectors, such as the hotel and restaur -
ant sector and the wholesale and retail trade, 
have been taking on staff again. By contrast, 
the decline in manufacturing continued.
Short- time working is still being deployed on a 
considerable scale, although there was already 
a marked decline in the use of this instrument 
in June. As the Federal Employment Agency re -
vised its estimates for the preceding months 
downwards, the latest data show the peak had 
already been reached in April, with almost 6  million short- time workers. By June, their 
number had fallen by one- tenth to just under 
5.4 million. As there was also a marked fall in 
the average number of hours worked per short- 
time worker, the volume of labour lost through 
short- time work had already shrunk by more 
than one- quarter compared with the peak in 
April.
As in July, the number of persons officially 
registered as unemployed in August remained 
roughly at the previous month’s level in season -
ally adjusted terms. The unemployment rate re -
mained constant at 6.4% for the third consecu -
tive month. Unemployment within the un -
employment insurance scheme, with its cyclical 
character, continued to rise slightly, while a 
somewhat smaller number of persons were re -
ceiving the basic welfare allowance. According 
to leading labour market indicators, the recov -
ery trends in employment and unemployment 
look set to continue.
Prices
Crude oil prices continued their upward trend 
in August 2020 against the backdrop of re -
covering global demand and production cuts in 
producer nations. They were 3½% higher com -
pared with July, but were still one- quarter 
down on the year. Crude oil prices decreased 
again somewhat in the first half of September, 
however. As this report went to press, the price 
of a barrel of Brent crude oil stood at US$43. 
Crude oil futures were trading at a slight pre -
mium. The premium on crude oil futures was 
US$2 for deliveries six months ahead and 
US$3½ for deliveries 12 months ahead.
Import prices increased again markedly in July 
on the back of higher energy prices. By con -
trast, imported other goods were cheaper. Do -
mestic industrial sales prices, for which data on 
August are already available, were also higher 
because of energy. By contrast, sales prices of 
other goods remained unchanged. Towards 
the end of the period under review, import Construction still

prices and industrial producer prices were 4½% 
and 1% down on the year respectively.
Consumer prices (HICP) were unchanged in 
August  in seasonally adjusted terms, after fall -
ing sharply in July as a result of the lowering of 
VAT rates. Energy prices declined somewhat in 
spite of higher crude oil prices. Consumers were 
paying around the same amount for food and 
services as in the previous month. Industrial 
goods excluding energy became slightly more 
expensive. Annual headline HICP inflation was 
negative for the first time since 2016 and stood 
at -0.1%, compared with zero in the previous 
month.1 Excluding energy and food, the rate 
was also down slightly from +0.7% to +0.6%. 
In the coming months, headline inflation is 
likely to be even more sharply down on the 
year, owing to the renewed decline in crude oil 
prices and base effects. The rates are not likely 
to become positive again until the cut in VAT 
rates is rescinded in January 2021. Relatively 
high inflation rates are then likely in the second 
half of 2021 owing to the fact that prices are 
currently being dampened by the VAT cut.
Public finances2
Statutory health insurance 
scheme
The statutory health insurance (SHI) scheme 
– comprising the health insurance institutions 
and the health fund – posted a deficit of €1½ 
billion in the second quarter of 2020. This rep -
resented a rise of €½ billion compared with the 
previous year. The pandemic impacted both the 
statutory health insurance institutions and the 
health fund in very different ways.
Health insurance institutions performed signifi -
cantly better than in the previous year, record -
ing a surplus of 2½ billion (following a deficit 
of €½ billion). This was mainly due to the de -
cline in institutions’ expenditure (-1%) on ac -
count of the lower utilisation of services and 
lower billing for these overall due to the pan -demic. Spending on hospital treatment, in par -
ticular, decreased (-8%). As a result of the 
coronavirus pandemic, hospitals were in -
structed to postpone operations and proced -
ures as far as possible in order to keep suffi -
cient capacity free to treat COVID-  19 patients. 
Due to the number of infections then also 
being rapidly contained, significantly fewer op -
erations and procedures were thus carried out 
overall.3 Spending on dental procedures, rem -
edies and therapeutic appliances, health spa 
treatments, and preventative healthcare and 
health promotion measures likewise decreased 
strongly in some cases. By contrast, sickness 
benefits rose very sharply, probably driven by 
short- time working: if an employee is ill and 
continues to have their salary paid by their em -
ployer when short-time work commences, 
short- time working benefits (including social 
contributions) are reimbursed by the health in -
surance institutions in the form of sickness 
benefits. Revenue climbed steadily, however. It 
consists mainly of transfers from the health 
fund, which are fixed in advance, and with the 
average supplementary contribution rate re -
maining unchanged, it grew by 4%. Thanks to 
the resulting surplus, the health insurance insti -
tutions’ financial reserves rose to almost €21 
billion.
The health fund, by contrast, posted a signifi -
cant deficit of €4 billion (just over 3½ billion 
higher than last year). This is largely due to 
contribution shortfalls as a result of the eco -
nomic downturn caused by the pandemic.

New tax estimate presented
The fi  rst offi   cial tax estimate to be produced 
since the onset of the coronavirus pan-
demic was drawn up in May of this year, at 
which time the general situation was ex-
tremely uncertain. On 10 September 2020, 
the Working Party on Tax Revenue Esti-
mates therefore submitted an update out-
side the standard cycle for presenting such 
estimates, calculated using a new Federal 
Government macroeconomic projection. 
This is the basis for drafting the central 
govern ment budget for 2021 and for the 
medium- term fi  scal plan up to 2024. The 
decisions by the Federal Cabinet concerning 
this matter were announced on 23 Septem-
ber. The passing of the 2021 central gov-
ernment budget by the Bundestag will then 
be based on the next tax estimate, which is 
due in November 2020.
Tax revenue patterns according to the 
new estimate
According to the updated estimate, general 
government tax revenue is set to contract 
by 10% year on year in 2020, largely on the back of the projected declines in key macro-
economic reference variables. As average 
wages are also in decline, progressive tax-
ation will push revenue down further, while 
short- time working benefi  ts, which effect-
ively replace a large part of lost income, are 
not taxed.1 On top of this, changes to tax 
legislation are throttling revenue. Most of 
these steps were taken to alleviate the 
effects  of the coronavirus pandemic. The 
second Coronavirus Tax Assistance Act 
(Zweites Corona- Steuerhilfegesetz), passed 
at the end of June, will cause the bulk of 
these losses. Amongst other measures, this 
legislation brought in a temporary VAT cut, 
applic able throughout the second half of 
2020, as well as a one- off “bonus” child 
benefi  t payment. Moreover, the (fi  rst) 
Coronavirus Tax Assistance Act, adopted a 
short time beforehand, substituted the 
standard VAT rate on meals consumed in 
1 For the purposes of income tax assessment, how-
ever, short- time working benefi  ts are factored in when 
determining the tax rate (Progressionsvorbehalt), thus 
(pushing up tax rates and in turn) leading to a moder-
ate increase in tax revenue in the following year.

catering establishments with the reduced 
rate; this will apply until the end of June 
2021. Since March, sub- statutory provisions 
have made it easier for businesses to have 
advance payments of taxes on income re-
duced or reimbursed. Advance VAT pay-
ments, which are normally a prerequisite 
for  extending payment deadlines by one 
month, were also reimbursed in some 
cases. Over and above this, upon request, 
fi  rms can defer payment of taxes owed, 
with compulsory enforcement suspended 
until the end of the year.
Tax receipts are expected to rebound signifi  -
cantly in 2021 (+7½%), primarily on ac-
count of the macroeconomic catch- up pro-
cess. Meanwhile, progressive taxation should 
boost revenue, as usual. Back- payments of 
taxes due (once coronavirus measures are 
no longer in place) will be offset by further 
shortfalls resulting from support measures 
and from the partial abolition of the solidar-
ity surcharge. In the years thereafter, i.e. 
from 2022 to 2024, revenue is projected to 
rise annually by between 5% and 4½%, 
largely refl  ecting the assumptions made re-
garding nominal macroeconomic develop-
ments and progressive taxation.
The working party only takes account of 
the tax legislation applicable when it draws up a tax estimate. As a consequence, it 
takes no account of the second Family 
Relief  Act (Zweites Familienentlastungs-
gesetz) that was only recently adopted by 
the Federal Cabinet and which provides for 
a rise in the basic tax allowance as well as 
in the child tax allowance in 2021 and 
2022. Under this legislation, the other in-
come tax brackets are set to be shifted to 
the right in a continued effort to counter-
balance bracket creep. Furthermore, as 
stipulated in the coalition agreement, child 
benefi  ts are to be raised signifi  cantly again 
in 2021.
Revisions since previous projections
With respect to this year, the current tax 
estimate  confi  rms the May projection. 
While the new macroeconomic assump-
tions,2 taken in isolation, effectively lift the 
estimate, the legislative changes that were 
fi  nally  enacted in June will result in almost 
equally sizeable shortfalls. In its estimate for 
2021, the working party envisages a cut of 
€19½ billion (½% of GDP), chiefl  y arising 
from the effects of the additional support 
measures. By contrast, the small downward 
revisions made to the macroeconomic

assump tions are of minor signifi  cance. The 
estimates  for 2022 and 2023 were adjusted 
downwards by about €5 billion in each in-
stance, while the projection for 2024 is 
virtually  unchanged. The small revision in 
2024 is due to the fact that the fi  nancial 
impact of expanded tax write- off options 
under the second Coronavirus Tax Assis-
tance Act will taper off.
Compared with the last pre- coronavirus 
estimate  (autumn 2019), the broad outline 
has thus changed only to a moderate de-
gree vis- a- vis the May fi  gures. This year’s 
expected tax receipts are down by almost 
€100 billion (3% of GDP). The annual rev-
enue losses are expected to subsequently 
wane, though a shortfall of just over €50 
billion (as compared with the autumn 2019 
estimate) is still anticipated by the end of 
the projection period in 2024. According to 
the revised projection, these drops in rev-
enue are mainly due to the fact that eco-
nomic activity will be unable to match the 
macroeconomic expectations from prior to 
the coronavirus pandemic. Although rev-
enue shortfalls caused by legislative 
changes (notably the partial abolition of 
the solidarity surcharge) will continue to 
play a role in the medium term, the mag-
nitude of these is not on a par with the 
effects  of the revised macroeconomic ex-
pectations.
Compared with the May estimate, the cur-
rent tax estimate is more sound, not least 
because it takes account of additional fi  g-
ures for months affected by the pandemic. 
As a result, considerably more information 
has become available on the economic con-
sequences of the pandemic and the fi  nan-
cial impact of support measures for this 
year. Nevertheless, the level of uncertainty 
remains pronounced, not just in relation to 
macroeconomic development but also to 
the tax estimate in the narrower sense, as 
well as to any further fi  scal policy measures 
that might be taken.In this context, activating the debt brake 
escape  clause, both in the current year and 
in 2021, makes sense. This strategy does 
away with the need for immediate action to 
offset the large shortfalls in tax revenue 
compared with previous fi  scal plans and the 
non- tax stabilisation measures, thus boost-
ing the economic revival as much as pos-
sible and minimising potential output losses. 
The better this can be achieved, the smaller 
the structural fi  scal gaps caused by the crisis 
will be. From today’s perspective, there is a 
need for medium- term fi  scal action com-
pared to previous fi  scal plans inasmuch as 
the tax estimate still contains structural rev-
enue shortfalls. Other fi  scal challenges also 
exist, for example as a result of demo-
graphic developments. Moreover, the ad-
justments necessary in connection with cli-
mate action and digitalisation also need to 
be accompanied by government funding. In 
this respect, it is important that any further 
budgetary support measures be imple-
mented on a temporary basis. Given the 
prevailing elevated level of uncertainty, 
however, the extent of the actual medium- 
term need for structural adjustment cannot 
yet be reliably determined. It would there-
fore also seem appropriate to refrain from 
adopting concrete medium- term consolida-
tion measures for the time being.Tax estimates: revisions made in the

The effects of lower levels of employment were 
cushioned by contributions payable on short-  
time working benefits. Enterprises’ deferral of 
contribution payments in the period from 
March to May is likely to have had a minimally 
negative impact on the quarterly figures on bal -
ance, according to data provided by the Fed -
eral Office for Social Security. Overall, however, 
contribution receipts were still up slightly 
(+½%). This was due to growing contributions 
payable on unemployment benefits and pen -
sions. On the expenditure side, the above-  
mentioned significantly higher transfers to the 
health insurance institutions played a major 
role. In addition, special tasks were conferred on the health fund by way of exception, which 
saw it grant financial assistance to providers of 
therapeutic treatment and pay investment 
grants for additional intensive care beds (al -
most €1½ billion in total). In addition, hospitals 
received compensation for vacant beds (just 
over €5½ billion). However, as central govern -
ment reimbursed the health fund for these pay -
ments in a timely manner, they had no impact 
on its balance.
The health fund was initially likely to record a 
deficit of €2 billion for 2020 as a whole. The 
same amount was to be withdrawn from the 
reserves to finance lower contributions for 
occupa tional pensions and transfers to the 
Innov ation and Structural Funds. The reserves 
totalled just over €10 billion at the beginning of 
the year (with a minimum reserve level of €4 
billion). For the reasons outlined above, the 
deficit will now be significantly higher. In order 
to support the health fund, central government 
is paying an additional lump sum of €3½ billion 
this year, as set out in its second supplementary 
budget. This is likely to prevent the minimum 
reserve level from being undercut at the end of 
the year.
Despite the coronavirus pandemic, health insti -
tutions are likely to post a better result for the 
year as a whole than expected at the beginning 
of the year. The figures projected by the group 
of SHI estimators4 indicated an annual deficit of 
€1½ billion, assuming no change in the aver -
age supplementary contribution rates (which 
has been the case so far). At the end of the first 
half of the year, the health insurance institu -
tions recorded a surplus of €1½ billion. The an -
nual result will now largely depend on the ex -
tent to which the utilisation of services returns 
to normal and to which it is possible to catch 
up on postponed procedures in a timely man -Health fund to

4 Last autumn, the group of SHI estimators was unable to 
mutually agree on an expenditure estimate. Taking the 
somewhat higher expenditure figure projected by the 
health insurance institutions would go so far as to result in 
a deficit of around €3 billion, assuming supplementary con -
tribution rates remain unchanged.Deutsche Bundesbank

ner. Due in part to lower VAT saving health in -
surance institutions €½ billion on spending on 
pharmaceuticals in the second half of the year, 
the institutions’ result is likely to be more fa -
vourable than in the previous year (2019: -€1½ 
billion).
The health fund’s financial situation will prob -
ably ease next year, as its regular transfers are 
likely to grow only moderately if contribution 
rates remain unchanged. By contrast, there is 
expected to be a high degree of financial pres -
sure on the health insurance institutions, whose 
expenditure on services could rise significantly 
again, as it was before the coronavirus crisis. 
This fundamental spending pressure could tem -
porarily intensify even further during a catch- up 
period for procedures postponed from 2020. In 
addition, a vaccine against the novel corona -
virus is expected to be available next year, 
which would bring marked additional expend -
iture along with it. If average supplementary 
contribution rates remain unchanged, there is 
therefore a risk of a high deficit.
In the autumn, the group of SHI estimators will 
present an official forecast assessing financial 
developments. In the past, expenditure growth 
has often been overestimated – in some cases 
significantly. As a result, the supplementary 
contribution rates were often set too high and 
the health insurance institutions’ reserves rose 
sharply (see the chart above). According to 
press reports, the Federal Ministry of Health 
and the National Association of Statutory 
Health Insurance Funds currently expect add -
itional funding of €18 billion to be required for 
2021 (assuming an unchanged average supple -
mentary contribution rate of 1%). In order to 
cover such a gap through contributions, the 
current average supplementary contribution 
rate would have to rise by 1.2  percentage 
points.
However, in view of the coronavirus crisis, the 
Federal Government had announced that it 
would widely limit an increase in contribution 
rates this year and next. Forgoing a rise in con -tributions in this way is to be welcomed in the 
current tough economic climate. According to 
press reports, central government is currently 
aiming for a combination of three variables in 
total to plug the funding gap. First, the central 
government grant is to be raised on a one- time 
basis through higher debt (+€5 billion). Second, 
health insurance institutions with high reserves 
should draw on these funds and, in some 
cases, also make them available to other health 
insurance institutions (in the order of €8  bil -
lion). Third, the remaining gap (around €5 bil -
lion) is to be plugged by increasing the average 
supplementary contribution rate by 0.3  per -
centage point (or by further recourse to re -
serves).
It would currently appear that no additional 
central government funds are envisaged for 
health insurance institutions in 2022. Based on 
current expectations, the contribution base 
could be growing markedly again at this point 
and coronavirus- related burdens largely taper -Strong financial

ing off. However, it is unlikely that the funding 
gap will be anywhere near closed, not least be -
cause of the longer- term expenditure trend 
which is independent of the coronavirus pan -
demic. Given the then significantly lower re -
serves, the average supplementary contribution 
rate is likely to rise steeply in 2022. In view of 
the prevailing economic risks, it would be 
worth considering a gradual phasing- out of 
support measures. In order to achieve this, cen -
tral government assis tance could be higher 
next year. Greater recourse to health insurance 
institutions’ reserves could thus be partly post -
poned until 2022, and the increase in supple -
mentary contribution rates could be smoothed somewhat. However, this does not reduce the 
pressure to raise supplementary contribution 
rates in the longer term. The SHI scheme there -
fore still needs to ensure the cost- efficient pro -
vision of healthcare.
Public long- term care 
insurance  scheme
The public long- term care insurance scheme 
closed the second quarter of 2020 with a bal -
anced budget in the core area.5 It had posted a 
surplus of €1 billion in the previous year. This 
deterioration was caused, in large part, by two 
factors: contribution shortfalls as a result of the 
economic downturn and expenditure relating 
to the pandemic. Revenue went up by 1%. 
Higher contributions payable on unemploy -
ment benefits and pensions were offset by a 
slight decline in employees’ contributions. Ex -
penditure grew by a very substantial €9½%. 
The increase in cash benefits was somewhat 
stronger still (+12%), mainly due to a higher 
number of recipients of benefits while long-  
term care benefit rates remained unchanged. 
Contributions to the pension insurance scheme 
for relatives who act as family carers also rose 
steeply. Spending on non- cash benefits, a very 
large expenditure item, rose by 8½%. Growth 
in spending on full inpatient care continued to 
be weak. However, pandemic- related compen -
sation (€½ billion) made itself felt, with outpa -
tient, day- patient and full inpatient facilities re -
ceiving compensation for revenue shortfalls 
caused by the non- utilisation of long- term care 
services6 on account of the coronavirus and for 
extraordinary expenses (e.g. personal protect -
ive equipment and additional personnel). In

5 The developments outlined here and in the remainder of 
the text exclude the provident fund. This fund uses grants 
financed by contributions from the core area to accumu -
late assets. These assets are to be depleted again in the 
2030s to dampen the expected contribution rate rise. At 
the end of the first half of 2020, the accumulated reserves 
stood at €7 billion.

was paid out to nursing staff in the second 
quarter. Adjusted for the special pandemic-  
related payments, expenditure on services 
would have been 3½% higher.
It is likely that a surplus will still be recorded for 
the year as a whole, though this figure will be 
markedly lower than in the previous year (2019: 
just over €3 billion). Although central govern -
ment is providing a one- off grant of just under 
€2 billion to compensate for the extraordinary 
expenditure resulting from the pandemic, con -
tribution receipts are still likely to be weak over 
the remainder of the year and the underlying 
pace of growth in expenditure is likely to re -
main rapid.
Only a moderate increase in the revenue base is 
expected at present. At the same time, benefit 
rates will rise in a rule-  based manner. As a re -
sult, there are likely to be marked deficits. It will 
be possible, initially, to cover these using the 
relatively high general reserves (end- 2019: €7 
billion). However, contribution rate increases 
are likely going forward on account of demo -
graphic changes; these will dampen the expan -
sion of the revenue base and push up expend -
iture significantly.
Securities markets
Bond market
At €172.2 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in July 2020 was slightly up on 
the previous month’s figure, which was already 
very high (€168.2 billion). After taking account 
of redemptions, which also increased some -
what, and changes in issuers’ holdings of their 
own debt securities, the outstanding volume of 
domestic bonds expanded by €49.5 billion 
after having increased by €47.0 billion in June. 
Foreign debt securities worth €0.7 billion were 
placed in the German market, which meant 
that the outstanding volume of domestic and 
foreign debt instruments in Germany rose by 
€50.2 billion on balance.The public sector issued own bonds in the 
amount of €35.6 billion net in the reporting 
month. Central government, in particular, in -
creased its capital market debt substantially on 
balance (€35.6 billion), mainly issuing Treasury 
discount paper (Bubills: €17.5 billion). The new 
maturity segments of 7- year and 15- year Fed -
eral bonds were also topped up further – by 
€9.0 billion and €3.2 billion respectively. In 
addition, central government issued two- year 
Federal Treasury notes (Schätze) and five- year 
Federal notes (Bobls) (€5.5 billion and €5.2 bil -
lion respectively). This contrasted with net re -
demptions of ten- year Federal bonds (Bunds) 
totalling €10.2 billion. State and local govern -
ments issued bonds to the tune of €0.1 billion 
on balance.
Domestic enterprises placed debt securities 
worth €15.9 billion net in the market in July. 
This was mainly attributable to non- financial 
corporations, which on balance solely issued 
paper with a maturity of more than one year.Additional cen -

By contrast, domestic credit institutions scaled 
back their capital market debt by €2.0 billion 
net in the reporting month, primarily redeem -
ing mortgage Pfandbriefe on balance (€1.4 bil -
lion). The outstanding volume of public Pfand -
briefe and other bank debt securities that can 
be structured flexibly also fell (by €0.7 billion 
and €0.6 billion respectively). Only debt secur -
ities issued by specialised credit institutions 
(which include public promotional banks, for 
example) saw net issuance (of €0.6 billion).
The Bundesbank was the main buyer in July, 
acquiring debt securities worth €25.7 billion 
net, for the most part under the Eurosystem’s 
asset purchase programmes. These purchases 
almost exclusively involved domestic paper is -
sued by public sector entities. Foreign invest -
ors, meanwhile, acquired German bonds worth 
€21.4 billion net. Domestic non- banks ex -
panded their bond portfolios by €18.6 billion, 
while domestic credit institutions sold debt se -
curities worth €15.5 billion net.
Equity market
In July, domestic enterprises placed €2.1 billion 
worth of new shares in the German equity 
market. Sales of foreign shares in Germany rose 
by €6.8 billion in the same period. Domestic 
non- banks were dominant on the buyers’ side 
of the market, adding shares worth €24.2 bil -
lion net to their portfolios. Domestic credit in -
stitutions acquired equities for €0.7 billion net, 
while foreign investors offloaded domestic 
fund shares worth €16.0 billion net.
Mutual funds
Domestic mutual funds registered moderate in -
flows amounting to €7.4 billion in July. The vast 
majority of these funds were channelled into 
specialised funds (€5.7 billion), which are re -
served for institutional investors. Of the various 
asset classes, bond funds were the main bene -
ficiaries of the new funds (€9.6 billion), while mixed securities- based funds redeemed shares 
(€5.2 billion). Foreign mutual funds sold share 
certificates on the German market for €11.0 bil -
lion in net terms. On balance, domestic non-  
banks were practically the sole purchasers of 
mutual fund shares in the reporting month 
(€17.6 billion); foreign investors purchased mu -
tual fund shares worth €0.9 billion net, while 
domestic credit institutions reduced their fund 
portfolio by €0.1 billion.
Balance of payments
Germany’s current account posted a surplus of 
€20.0 billion in July 2020, down €0.5 billion 
from the previous month’s level. The surplus in 
the goods account expanded significantly, 
while the surplus in invisible current transac -
tions, which comprise services as well as pri -
mary and secondary income, contracted some -
what more sharply.
In July, the surplus in the goods account in -
creased by €3.5 billion on the month to €18.8 
billion. Economic activity in Germany and many 
partner countries continued to recover grad -
ually in July. Consequently, both German goods 
exports and goods imports rose further, with 
goods exports noticeably outpacing imports.
In July, the surplus on invisible current transac -
tions fell by €4.0 billion to €1.2 billion. This was 
due to declining balances in the services ac -
count and in secondary income, which out -
weighed the gains in primary income. Net 
receipts  in primary income expanded by €2.2 
billion to €7.1 billion. A major factor here was 
that dividend payments for portfolio invest -
ment to non- residents continued to fall follow -
ing the usual significant increase in May. By 
contrast, a €3.9 billion decline in the services 
account balance pushed it into a deficit of €2.4 
billion. Income increased slightly. However, ex -
penditure rose significantly more strongly than 
receipts, also due to the recovery in travel after 
the measures taken to contain the pandemic 
were eased starting from June. In addition, the Fall in credit

deficit in secondary income went up by €2.2 
billion to €3.6 billion, mainly driven by lower 
government revenue from current taxes on in -
come and wealth of non- residents and higher 
general government payments to the EU 
budget made in connection with financing 
related  to gross national income.
In July 2020, the effects of the COVID-  19 pan -
demic continued to shape events in the inter -
national financial markets. Concerns about a 
second wave of new infections in many Euro -
pean countries and the stalemate in the nego -
tiations on the extension of the stimulus pack -
age in the United States increased market par -
ticipants’ uncertainty. These developments 
were also reflected in Germany’s cross- border 
portfolio investment, which recorded capital in -
flows of €2.4 billion in July (June: outflows of 
€1.2 billion). Foreign investors acquired Ger -
man securities worth €21.8 billion net, pur -
chasing bonds (€12.2 billion, with an emphasis 
on bonds issued by the private sector) money 
market paper (€9.2 billion) and investment 
fund shares (€0.9 billion). By contrast, they 
divested  themselves of shares issued by Ger -
man enterprises (€0.4 billion). Domestic invest -
ors purchased foreign securities worth a total 
of €19.4 billion net. On balance, they acquired 
foreign investment fund shares (€11.0 billion), 
regular shares (€7.8 billion) and money market 
paper (€1.9 billion). By comparison, German in -
vestors sold bonds issued abroad (€1.2 billion). 
On balance, they parted exclusively with euro- 
denominated paper, while maintaining net de -
mand for foreign currency bonds.
Financial derivatives recorded net capital ex -
ports of €11.6 billion in July (June: €12.1 bil -
lion).
Turning to direct investment, German enter -
prises saw net capital imports of €7.6 billion in 
July (following capital exports of €6.5 billion in 
June). Foreign firms stepped up their direct in -
vestment in Germany by €14.4 billion. On bal -
ance, they did so exclusively through additional

The impact of monetary policy on the 
euro’s exchange rate
The monetary policy of central banks is a key determinant of the exchange rate. Although 
exchange rates are not a target variable of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy, the interest rate 
environment – with monetary policy as one of its major determinants – is of fundamental import -
ance for developments in the euro’s exchange rate. After introducing the basic theoretical mech -
anisms, this article presents a number of empirical studies on the impact of euro area monetary 
policy on the euro’s exchange rate.
Initial indications of a significant relationship between monetary policy and foreign exchange 
markets are provided by the observation that there is a marked increase in the volatility of bilat -
eral euro exchange rates during the communication of monetary policy decisions. In line with 
this, many of the largest single- day losses and gains of the euro also have a monetary policy 
background. Moreover, the exchange rate movements of the euro on days when monetary policy 
meetings are held are more pronounced than otherwise. This discrepancy appears to have 
increased yet further over time.
In order to say anything about causality, however, monetary policy impulses first have to be care -
fully disentangled from other determinants relevant to financial markets and the real economy. In 
event studies, this is done by looking at interest rates only in a very narrow window surrounding 
monetary policy announcements. Results of such an event study show that a contractionary mon -
etary policy impulse of the Eurosystem leads directly to a significant appreciation of the euro, 
although the effect appears to be weaker if the impulse works mainly through short- term interest 
rates. According to the event study, the impact of monetary policy on the euro’s exchange rate 
has increased over time.
Vector autoregressive (VAR) models are more complex than event studies and model interdepend -
encies between monetary policy and other economic developments. An analysis of this kind sug -
gests for the euro/ US dollar exchange rate that the impact of monetary policy over the past few 
years was considerable even compared with other macroeconomic determinants.
Above and beyond an inherent impulse, however, monetary policy communication can also sup -
ply additional information that is likewise of great importance for financial markets. One example 
of this is the central bank’s assessment of the economic situation and outlook. “Information 
impulses” of this kind work on the exchange rate in a way that is different from direct monetary 
policy signals. Furthermore, these indirect effects vary depending on the currency against which 
the euro’s exchange rate is defined. Currencies that are perceived more strongly as speculative 
respond differently from “safe haven” currencies. How the observed partner currency typically 
responds to variations in investors’ risk appetite is therefore a factor.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
In a globally interconnected world, exchange 
rates play a major economic role. Not only 
trade flows, but also international flows of cap -
ital are crucially determined by the exchange 
rates between currencies. For open economies, 
especially, a depreciation of the domestic cur -
rency can, for example, lead – at least in the 
short to medium term – to price competition 
advantages, since domestic goods then be -
come cheaper for major trading partners.1 
There is also an attendant downside that mir -
rors this, however: imported goods become 
more expensive in relative terms, lowering do -
mestic purchasing power as a result. Along 
with the depreciation, there is, moreover, an 
increase – from a domestic perspective – in the 
value of (external) assets and (external) liabil -
ities denominated in foreign currency. In the 
case of assets, a depreciation leads to a gain in 
wealth in the domestic currency.2 A high level 
of foreign debt in foreign currency is relevant, 
above all, for developing and emerging market 
economies, in which the bond markets are 
often underdeveloped and bonds are issued in 
foreign currency, mainly US dollar. The major 
importance of exchange rates in economic pol -
icy calls for an examination of the factors that 
influence them.
It is, above all, monetary policy that has a key 
role to play here. For one thing, central banks 
have the option to intervene directly in the for -
eign exchange market by buying and selling.3 
Above and beyond that, however, they exert 
an indirect influence on exchange rates through 
their interest rate policy. Although the ex -
change rate is not a target variable for the 
Euro system, for example,4 monetary policy 
measures inevitably have side effects on for -
eign exchange markets that are transmitted to 
other countries. Especially a period in which 
there is a substantial difference in the monetary 
policy stance of two countries can bring with it 
marked movements in the bilateral exchange 
rate. This illustrates how important it is to 
understand and, as far as possible, quantify the effects on the markets of a monetary policy 
geared to domestic targets such as price stabil -
ity.
Theoretical considerations 
and initial empirical evidence
In the post- war period up to the collapse of the 
Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s, the 
monetary policy of even advanced economies 
was, as a rule, geared to an exchange rate tar -
get. One of the chief tasks of central banks was 
to maintain the peg to the US dollar by means 
of their monetary policy stance and direct inter -
ventions in the foreign exchange market. The 
progressive liberalisation of cross- border capital 
flows increasingly restricted the options for 
shaping monetary policy in this regime, how -
ever. If an overly accommodative interest rate 
policy led to net capital outflows that were not 
solely temporary in nature, there was a danger 
of the central bank’s US dollar holdings running 
out because of foreign exchange market inter -
ventions. This meant that the central bank had 
to tighten monetary policy regardless of the 
economic situation at home and had to follow 
the objective of upholding the exchange rate 
peg.Importance of

2 In the first quarter of 2020, for example, Germany’s net 
international investment position amounted to almost €2.4 
trillion (see the International investment position and exter -
nal debt tables in the Bundesbank’s Statistical series https://
www.bundesbank.de/en/publications/statistics/statistical- 
series/statistical- series- international- investment- position- 
and- external- debt- 841806 ). Of this amount, the share of 
Germany’s external assets denominated in foreign currency 
was significantly larger than the foreign currency share of 
external liabilities.
3 The scale of foreign currency reserves held by central 
banks is also sufficiently large to be able to cause signifi -
cant exchange rate effects by their use. The International 
Monetary Fund gives the official foreign exchange reserves 
of the 149 reporting countries for the first quarter of 2020 
as the equivalent of almost US$12 trillion (see https://data.
imf.org/cofer ).

The role of the euro exchange rate in ECB press conferences
Monetary policy impulses are usually identi-
fi  ed in the literature as a key determinant of 
the exchange rate. However, many major 
central banks, such as the Eurosystem, do 
not regard the exchange rate as a target 
variable. This raises the question of the ex-
tent to which exchange rate topics play any 
role at all in monetary policy communica-
tion.
One way of answering this question is to 
examine the ECB’s press conferences fol-
lowing monetary policy meetings. However, 
this is a complex undertaking, as 236 press 
conferences were held following monetary 
policy meetings in the period from the 
ECB’s founding in June 1998 to March 
2020,1 and the transcripts of these press 
conferences contain almost 1.4 million 
words. This is why so- called text mining ap-
proaches are used here.2 Unlike the analysis 
of prepared data, which is the norm in eco-
nomic research, text is unstructured and 
highly dimensional, especially compared 
with macroeconomic data. A different ap-
proach is therefore required for the analysis 
of text data. An analysis using methods 
from the fi  eld of machine learning is pre-
sented below.3
This analysis uses a topic modelling ap-
proach that draws on statistical methods to 
assign topics to individual sentences.4 These 
topics consist of a collection of words that 
occur together at a certain frequency in the 
examined sentences. In specifi  c terms, a 
latent  Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is esti-
mated.5 As part of this process, a probabil-
ity vector over the unobserved (“latent”) 
topics is assigned to each sentence. At the 
same time, each topic consists of a distribu-
tion across all words in the text. A Dirichlet 
distribution is assumed a priori for the par-
ameters of both distributions. In addition to 
the parameters for these two Dirichlet dis-tributions,6 the number of topics to be de-
termined must also be set a priori. Follow-
ing the literature, this number is set at 40.7
However, before the analysis of the text can 
begin, it must be put into an analysable 
form. After the html code downloaded 
from the ECB website was broken down 
into individual words and sentences, the 
text was adapted for the analysis as fol-
lows:
1 These are all the press conferences published 
on  https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/html/
index.en.html between 9  June 1998 and 12  March 
2020, with the exception of those on 13  October 
2003 and 26 October 2014, which dealt specifi  cally 
with a cooperation agreement with the Russian central 
bank and the comprehensive assessment and thus did 
not address the Eurosystem’s monetary policy.
2 Text- mining approaches are becoming increasingly 
popular in the area of monetary policy analysis, par-
ticularly using the minutes and transcripts of meetings 
of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), 
whether it be to measure the impact of different forms 
of communication on fi  nancial markets and the real 
economy (Hansen and McMahon (2016)), examine the 
effect of greater transparency on decision- making 
(Hansen et al. (2018)), determine the Federal Reserve’s 
objectives (Shapiro and Wilson (2019)), or determine 
whether stock prices have an important impact on 
monetary policy decisions (Cieslak and Vissing- 
Jørgensen (2020)).
3 For an overview of various methods in the fi  eld of 
text mining in relation to economic issues, see Gentz-
kow et al. (2019).
4 It would also be possible to analyse paragraphs in-
stead of sentences. However, paragraphs could prove 
to be too comprehensive, especially if the topics to be 
analysed are more specifi  c. Therefore, sentences are 
chosen as the unit of text, with each sentence being 
assigned one topic, much like the analysis of FOMC 
statements in Hansen and McMahon (2016).
5 See Blei et al. (2003).
6 A small and symmetrical value is selected for the par-
ameters of both distributions, so that both the prob-
ability vectors over the topics for the respective sen-
tences and the probability vectors over the words for 
the respective topics have many zeros. As a result, only 
a small number of topics are assigned to the individual 
sentences and the individual topics are dominated by 
only a few words.
7 See Hansen et al. (2018) for a brief discussion of 
methods for determining the number of topics. In their 
analysis of the transcripts of FOMC meetings, the 
authors likewise set the number of topics at 40. By 
contrast, procedures that optimise the goodness of fi  t 
are often said to select too many topics.Deutsche Bundesbank

– All non- alphabetical “words”, except 
common economic terms such as the 
money aggregates M1 to M3, are re-
moved; the names of the respective 
presidents and vice- presidents are also 
excluded from the analysis. This seems 
sensible, as both numbers and these 
names are frequently mentioned without 
being of material relevance to the 
present analysis.
– Other words that occur very frequently 
but are scarcely of material relevance, 
such as “the”, “and” or “they”, are also 
removed. These make up around half of 
all the words in the text corpus and 
would thus dominate any statistical an-
alysis of the text.
– The remaining words are reduced to 
their root form.8
– Groups of up to four words are formed 
by extracting particularly common word combinations such as “exchange rate” or 
“monetary policy” from the text.9
– Finally, words that only occur once in the 
entire text as well as some other words 
that are very frequent yet not materially 
signifi  cant10 are excluded from the analy-
sis. As the topics searched for are deter-
mined on the basis of individual sen-
tences, sentences that have fewer than 
three words after these steps have been 
taken are also discarded.
The text corpus is thus reduced from the 
aforementioned 1.4 million words to just 
under 530,000 words.
The adjacent table shows the frequency of 
selected words in ECB press conferences. 
Just looking at this table, it is apparent that, 
consistent with the ECB’s mandate, issues 
relating to the euro exchange rate are not 
given a central role in communication. Al-
though the word “euro” appears more than 
1,700 times, it can be used in various con-
texts. Other words used in connection with 
the exchange rate appear much less fre-
quently. This becomes particularly clear 
when comparing the frequency of these 
words with terms that do relate to the core 
topics of monetary policy communication, 
such as “interest rate” or “price stability”. 
However, the most frequently used terms 
are usually less specifi  c and can be used in 
relation to various topics.
The chart on p.  23 shows three selected 
topics from the LDA analysis, including their 
respective “word cloud” and the share that 
each topic represents in all sentences con-
8 For example, the words “took” and “taken” are both 
reduced to their root form “take”. This is done using 
the WordNet lexical database (https://wordnet.

formed in this way are subsequently treated as words

tained in ECB press conferences over time. 
Word clouds visualise the words that con-
stitute a topic. The larger the word appears 
in the cloud, the more important it is for the 
topic.11 Topic #6, for example, is dominated 
by exchange rate- related terms such as 
“euro”, “exchange rate”, “currency” or 
“dollar”. It can therefore be labelled as an 
“exchange rate topic”. The accompanying 
chart shows that in the fi  rst few years after 
the introduction of the euro, the exchange 
rate topic played a somewhat greater role 
in communication. One press conference of 
note here is that of 3 January 2002, for ex-
ample. Not only was this the fi  rst monetary 
policy meeting following the introduction 
of euro banknotes, it also took place during 
a period of pronounced euro weakness. As 
a result, there was speculation about pos-
sible ECB intervention in the foreign ex-
change markets in favour of the euro. It is 
therefore not surprising that the fi  rst four 
questions asked by journalists following the 
introductory remarks of the then ECB Presi-dent Wim Duisenberg related to the euro 
exchange rate. With few exceptions, how-
ever, the exchange rate topic played only a 
small part in ECB communication in subse-
quent years. One of these exceptions was 
9 March 2017. In response to criticism by 
the new US administration of the current 
account surpluses of some euro area coun-
tries, Mario Draghi, the ECB President at the 
time, emphasised –  following questions 
from journalists  – that the euro was not 
undervalued compared with the long- term 
average. These two examples suggest that 
the exchange rate topic may have taken on 
a more prominent role mainly as a result of 
questions from journalists.
In order to assess the quality of the LDA an-
alysis, it is also worth taking a brief look at 
other topics. Topic #1 in the chart deals

In today’s system of flexible exchange rates in 
many medium- sized and large advanced econ -
omies, there is no longer this conflict of aims 
between the free movement of capital and 
scope for monetary policy decision- making,5 as 
balance of payments imbalances tend to be re -
duced by adjustments to the exchange rate. 
Net capital outflows would then result in a de -
preciation of the domestic currency and thus 
tend to lead to an improvement in the current 
account balance that would offset the financial 
account deficit. Owing to the changeover to 
systems of flexible exchange rates, exchange 
rates are nowadays no longer a target variable 
for the Eurosystem and most other central 
banks of large advanced economies,6 which is 
why interventions in the foreign exchange mar -
ket are undertaken by them only in exceptional 
cases.7
This is also reflected in the Eurosystem’s com -
munication of monetary policy. A breakdown 
of all the press conferences following monetary policy meetings of the Governing Council of 
the ECB employing state- of- the- art text mining 
techniques produces a clear- cut picture (see 
the box on pp. 21ff.) Apart from in the initial 
phase following the introduction of the euro, 
exchange rate matters have played no more 
than a secondary role in this important means Exchange rate 
matters play a 
secondary role 
in the communi -
cation of the 
ECB Governing 
Councilwith the Eurosystem’s asset purchase pro-
grammes. Large fl  uctuations in the import-
ance of this topic in ECB communication 
fi  rst appear in mid- 2009, when the fi  rst 
covered bond purchase programme (CBPP) 
was announced and implemented, with 
even greater volatility seen later as of Octo-
ber 2014 with the announcement of the 
asset-backed security purchase programme 
(ABSPP) and the now third CBPP .12 Topic 
#14, by contrast, focuses on the economic 
outlook, which is generally part of the intro-
ductory remarks. This topic therefore plays 
a particularly important role in all press con-
ferences.
The text- mining approach used here there-
fore gives the following answer to the 
question asked at the beginning of this box 
on the role of the euro exchange rate in 
Euro system communication. In line with the 
widespread notion that the exchange rates 
of large, advanced economies should be determined by market forces, exchange 
rates play a fairly minor role in the ECB’s 
communication. Any monetary policy im-
pulses on the exchange rate resulting from 
Eurosystem communication are therefore 
very likely not the primary objective of this 
communication.
12 It should be noted here that the LDA analysis deter-
mines the topics without any economics- based specifi  -
cations and solely on a statistical basis (“unsupervised 
learning”). Topic #1 can therefore be interpreted as in 
the text, but it also takes up other issues, albeit to a 
lesser extent. It is therefore not surprising that the 
share of topic #1 is greater than zero even in the press 
conferences held before the fi  rst CBPP was announced. 
Isolated keywords on asset purchase programmes are 
also found in word clouds not listed here, for example 
in a topic with a strong link to forward guidance. How-
ever, the exchange rate topic, which is the main focus 
here, is fairly clearly distinguished from the other topics 
by the LDA analysis.
5 The conflict of aims between the free flow of capital, 
fixed exchange rates, and scope for independent monetary 
decision- making is also known as the “impossible trinity”. 
Only two of these objectives can be achieved at the same 
time. Recently, however, there has been discussion about 
whether this trilemma has not changed into a dilemma; 
see Rey (2015) and the literature building on it.
6 The exchange rate does, however, affect the general do -
mestic price level through its impact on import prices and 
may thus – at least in the event of major fluctuations – also 
be of monetary policy relevance when pursuing an inflation 
target.
7 The most recent event of this kind for the Eurosystem 
was a coordinated foreign exchange market intervention in 
March 2011, when the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Canada, 
the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England as well as the ECB 
intervened jointly to counter upward pressure on the Jap -
anese yen. The yen began to rise in value in the aftermath 
of a devastating earthquake in Japan, prompting a re -
sponse that included repatriation of Japanese external 
assets and increased demand for yen from insurers.Deutsche Bundesbank

of communication for the Eurosystem. This is 
indicated firstly by a straightforward break -
down of how frequently certain words are 
used in the press conferences and is backed up 
by a more in- depth statistical analysis. Matters 
concerning exchange rates are brought to the 
fore, at most, in exceptional cases.
Monetary policy nevertheless still plays a crucial 
role in determining exchange rates. One key 
mechanism for this in economic theory is un -
covered interest parity (UIP). This theory states 
that the expected return on a secure invest -
ment in domestic currency must be same as 
that on an equivalent secure investment in for -
eign currency.8 If domestic interest rates are 
lower than those on a comparable investment 
abroad, say, UIP requires that the investor ex -
pects an appreciation of the domestic currency 
over time which balances out the expected re -
turn on both investments. Otherwise, the ex -
pected higher return externally should prompt 
increased investment in foreign bonds, leading, 
along with other effects, to their prices rising 
and their interest rates falling until uncovered 
interest parity had been restored. According to 
this theory, these mechanisms ensure that un -
covered interest parity is maintained.9
Uncovered interest parity is also a key compon -
ent of many theoretical models for determining 
the exchange rate, as it is in the class of mon -
etary models.10 These make the simplifying as -
sumption that government bonds of different 
countries differ, at most, in terms of their inter -
est rates, which – under the additional assump -
tion of rational expectations among market 
agents  – already implies uncovered interest 
parity. A further major component of such 
models is purchasing power parity theory. In its 
simplest form (assuming fully flexible goods 
prices), this theory states that, after conversion 
into a single currency, an equivalent basket of 
goods in two countries must have the same 
price.11
In the most widely used version of the monet -
ary model, it is additionally assumed that goods prices adjust only gradually to market condi -
tions. In this case, purchasing power parity the -
ory holds only in the long term. An increase in 
the nominal money supply then also leads, at 
least temporarily, to an increase in the real 
money supply, as prices in the goods market 
are raised only with a time lag. If the additional 
funds are invested, say, in fixed interest secur -
ities, the nominal interest rate falls, leading to 
rising money demand which brings the money Uncovered

market into equilibrium again. In this environ -
ment, there are two factors at once which act 
to bring about a depreciation: the foreseeable 
price increase via purchasing power parity the -
ory and the lower interest rates through un -
covered interest parity. This means that, in this 
model framework, monetary expansion results 
directly in a disproportionate depreciation of 
the domestic currency. By virtue of the accom -
panying decline in the real money supply, the 
ensuing successive upward adjustment of the 
general price level also leads to the interest rate 
level returning to normal again. Because of 
this, what remains in the end is a depreciation 
of the domestic currency proportionate to the 
monetary expansion. This phenomenon in the 
model developed by Dornbusch is known as 
“overshooting the exchange rate”.
While the monetary approach yields simple and 
readily comprehensible mechanisms for the re -
sponse of exchange rates to monetary policy 
impulses and it is repeatedly possible to ob -
serve the “overshooting” of exchange rates, 
empirical studies find very little evidence for the 
validity of one essential model component: un -
covered interest parity.12 This becomes immedi -
ately apparent when comparing the interest 
rate differential of comparable investments in 
the euro area and the United States with devel -
opments in the euro/ US dollar exchange rate. 
If, for example, the interest rate on a three-  
month euro- denominated debt security is 
1 percentage point above that on an equiva -
lent security denominated in US dollar, UIP re -
quires an expected, annualised 1% depreciation 
of the euro against the US dollar. In reality, 
though, the actual annualised depreciation of 
the euro follows this rules only in exceptional 
cases. Rather, it is possible to observe a very 
wide dispersion of exchange rate changes. In 
fact, contrary to the prediction of UPI, there are 
often cases where the euro even appreciates 
against the US dollar in the above case. Among 
the reasons for such scant evidence for UIP 
could be risk and liquidity premia for curren -
cies, departures from rational expectations 
among market agents, the “peso problem”,13 as well as shortcomings in the economic ap -
proaches used.14
More recent approaches provide the model as -
sumptions with a microfoundation. Consider -
ation of firms’ and consumers’ intertemporal 
decision- making problems permits a dynamic 
analysis. Goods prices that adjust only grad -
ually, as in the Dornbusch model, are captured 
here through a combination of monopolistic 
competition and limited power to set prices.15 
Refinements of these dynamic general equilib -
rium models of open economies also attempt 
to incorporate empirical evidence regarding the 
model assumptions. Thus, departures from pur -
chasing power parity can be taken into account 
through introducing non- tradeable goods, for 
example, as well as through firms that set their 
prices on the (external) sales market (pricing- to- 
market), or through consumers having a prefer -
ence for domestic goods.16 Among the re -
sponses to a violation of UIP are the introduc -
tion of noise traders17 or a time- varying cur -
rency risk premium.18 The decoupling of Hardly any

12 See Hansen and Hodrick (1980) and Fama (1984) for 
early influential studies in this direction. In the case of the 
second major component of the model, purchasing power 
parity theory, the results are more multifaceted. See 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2004) as well as Rogoff (1996) 
where this point was already brought up.
13 The peso problem describes a situation in the foreign 
exchange market where investors price in an extreme event 
with a small probability. Owing to the rarity of such events, 
empirical studies lack the relevant observations, leading to 
a biasing of the results. The name comes from a situation 
in the 1970s when the Mexican peso was pegged to the 
US dollar, but investors suspected that Mexico’s central 
bank might not be able to maintain the peg on a perman -
ent basis. Accordingly, despite the fixed exchange rate, 
there was a persistently positive interest rate differential be -
tween Mexican and US bonds. Following the end of the 
Bretton Woods system, a depreciation of the Mexican peso 
against the US dollar did indeed occur in 1976.

recent research on interest parity.

can cause an “overshooting” of the exchange rate as in the 
Dornbusch model.

exchange rates and economic fundamentals 
– frequently observed empirically – can be bet -
ter explained in this way. These refinements 
provide important insights into the way open 
economies function; the fundamental qualita -
tive response of exchange rates to monetary 
policy impulses, however, resembles that of the 
monetary models. For example, there is indeed 
empirical evidence for an “overshooting “of the 
exchange rate, as was already predicted by the 
monetary model with rigid prices.
Indicators of the importance 
of monetary policy for euro 
exchange rate developments
One way to gain an initial descriptive impres -
sion of the effects of monetary policy on ex -
change rates is to look at the development and 
fluctuation band of euro exchange rates within 
very short periods of time on days when the 
ECB Governing Council’s monetary policy 
meetings take place. This shows a spike in such 
volatility calculated for the euro/ US dollar ex -
change rate at 13:45 Central European Time 
(CET), which is when the press release is pub -
lished. A second increase in volatility occurs 
during the subsequent press conference begin -
ning at 14:30 CET. This pattern contrasts with 
days on which no monetary policy meeting 
takes place, when similar surges in volatility are 
not observed. This suggests that monetary pol -
icy communication plays a major role in foreign 
exchange markets.
In this context, it is also unsurprising that sev -
eral of the largest daily changes in the nominal 
effective exchange rate of the euro are linked 
to monetary policy announcements. Amongst 
other examples, these include 22 January 2015, 
when the ECB Governing Council’s decision on 
the first major asset purchase programme (APP) 
triggered one of the largest ever depreciations 
of the euro. A similar situation was observed 
after the monetary policy meeting on 22 Octo -
ber 2015, after which the euro also experi -
enced a particularly steep single- day loss. Owing to low inflationary pressures, the ECB 
Governing Council at that time announced a 
review of the monetary policy stance, which 
market agents saw as a signal for an expansion 
of the asset purchase programme. At the next 
ECB Governing Council meeting on 3 Decem -
ber 2015, the interest rate on the deposit facil -
ity was lowered by 10 basis points and the dur -
ation of the asset purchase programme was 
extended, though the monthly purchase vol -
ume remained unchanged. Despite what were, 
in fact, expansionary measures, the euro effect -
ive exchange rate then experienced one of its 
most marked single- day appreciations. This 
shows the crucial importance of expectation 
formation among financial market players for 
the impact of monetary policy announcements 
on foreign exchange markets.
Sharp movements in the euro exchange rate 
can be caused, moreover, by direct intervention 
in the foreign exchange market, or by the lack 
thereof. On 15 January 2015, for example, the Empirical

euro depreciated by almost 19% against the 
Swiss franc19 when the Swiss National Bank dis -
continued the minimum exchange rate against 
the euro. As Switzerland is one of the euro 
area’s  most important trading partners, this 
measure had tangible consequences far be -
yond the bilateral euro/ franc exchange rate.
However, this is not to say that the exchange 
rate developments of the euro are determined 
solely by central bank decisions. In addition to 
monetary policy, other events can also cause 
major shifts in foreign exchange markets. For 
example, the UK referendum on 23 June 2016 
on a withdrawal from the EU led, amongst 
other things, to the euro appreciating by 6.2% 
against the pound sterling on the following 
day. At the same time, the euro depreciated, in 
some cases significantly, against currencies 
which tend to benefit from increased risk aver -
sion amongst investors. During that day, the 
euro was 6.0% lower against the yen, for 
instance . Furthermore, several of the euro’s 
strongest same- day movements occurred in 
the period when tensions were highest during 
the global financial crisis and are not necessar -
ily directly related to monetary policy events.
Based on this simple descriptive analysis, it is 
also possible to examine the extent to which 
the impact of monetary policy on the euro ex -
change rate, as measured in this way, may have 
changed over the euro’s 20- year history. To do 
this, euro area monetary policy can be divided 
into four time periods:20

– the subsequent period until the onset of the 
financial crisis (May 2003 to December 
2007);
– the outbreak of the global financial crisis 
plus the euro area debt crisis and their reper -
cussions (January 2008 to May 2014);
– the low interest rate period and the launch 
of asset purchase programmes (from June 
2014).
To gain an initial overview of potential differ -
ences in the transmission of monetary policy to 
exchange rates across the aforementioned 
periods, it is worth looking at the average ab -
solute daily changes in the euro/ US dollar ex -
change rate. Generally, in each of these periods 
it can be seen that the daily changes in the 
euro/ US dollar exchange rate were, on aver -
age, greater on days when monetary policy 
meetings of the ECB Governing Council were 
held than on other days. Moreover, it is pos -
sible to identify a change in this discrepancy 
over time as well. In the post- financial crisis 
period, in particular, exchange rate movements 
on days of monetary policy decisions become 
much more pronounced than movements on 
other days. During the most recent phase of 
exceptionally low interest rates, the discrep -
ancy is becoming even greater. In fact, ex -
change rate fluctuations on days when the 
Governing Council makes monetary policy de -
cisions are now, on average, almost as high as 
during the financial and debt crisis. On the 
other days, by contrast, they are smaller than 
ever before, on average. However, it is not pos -
sible to clearly conclude from this that the im -
pact of Eurosystem monetary policy on ex -
change rates has increased over time.
One factor that could put the above statement 
into perspective is the greater frequency of 
monetary policy meetings of the ECB Govern -
ing Council prior to the financial crisis in the 
euro area than since then. In the first three 
years after monetary union was established, 
they took place every two weeks, before a switch was made to a monthly cycle. The cur -
rent six-  week cycle was only introduced in 
2015. As a result, individual decision- making 
days were probably less important in the early 
phase of the Eurosystem. It is therefore unsur -
prising that exchange rate movements on days 
of monetary policy decisions during this period 
are only marginally larger than on the other 
days. In the period following the interest rate 
cut in June 2003, in particular, no further inter -
est rate adjustment was made over the next 29 
monetary policy meetings. During this phase, 
then, monetary policy news from the euro area 
was presumably less significant for the devel -
opment of the euro/ US dollar exchange rate.21
With the onset of the financial crisis, monetary 
policy once again took on greater significance 
for the exchange rate. In response to the lack 
of inflationary pressures associated with the 
economic downturn, the main refinancing rate 
was gradually lowered from 4.25% to 1% over 
a period of less than one year. Although the 
rate was raised again slightly two years later, 
the euro area debt crisis ultimately led to 
greater monetary policy accommodation, as a 
result of which the main refinancing rate was 
lowered to 0% by 2016. Against this back -
ground, it comes as no surprise that exchange 
rate movements on days of monetary policy 
decisions during this period were more pro -
nounced than in the first decade after the 
launch of the euro.

measures, such as forward guidance and asset 
purchase programmes, also increased the com -… has grown

21 By contrast, this period probably saw stronger monetary 
policy impulses for the bilateral exchange rate emanating 
from the United States. A contractionary monetary policy 
cycle had already been set in motion there in mid- 2004, 
with a gradual increase in monetary policy rates. However, 
the daily data used for this article make it difficult to dir -
ectly compare the exchange rate effects on days of monet -

plexity of monetary policy announcements. 
This phase of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy 
is noteworthy for the strength that exchange 
rate movements continue to show on days of 
monetary policy decisions and the significant 
decrease in volatility on the other days.22 There 
could be several reasons for the latter phenom -
enon. The period from mid- 2014 to the end of 
2019 was characterised by comparatively high 
economic growth and low inflation, for in -
stance, which could have helped keep volatility 
at a generally low level in foreign exchange 
markets.
To sum up, there is much to suggest that mon -
etary policy impulses play an important role, 
that perhaps varies over time, in exchange rate 
movements. However, in order to ultimately 
confirm this assumption and quantify this im -
pact, an approach that can also capture cau -
salities is needed.
Results of econometric 
approaches  to determining 
the causal effect of monet -
ary policy impulses on the 
exchange rate
Early empirical studies on flexible exchange 
rates mainly focused on examining the assump -
tions underpinning the monetary model, par -
ticularly uncovered interest parity and purchas -
ing power parity theory. By contrast, the more 
recent empirical literature increasingly ad -
dresses the question of the direct causal effect 
of monetary policy impulses on the exchange 
rate. One of the key difficulties here is deter -
mining the monetary policy impulse. Specific -
ally, it is a matter of carefully disentangling a 
monetary policy impulse and its causal effects 
on exchange rates from the influences of other 
factors (“identifying” the monetary policy im -
pulse). One challenging aspect is that monetary 
policy does not act of its own accord, but re -
sponds, above all, to economic developments.A slump in aggregate demand, for example, as 
was triggered by coronavirus,23 tends to have 
price-  dampening effects. Central banks have 
responded to this by cutting interest rates and 
expanding asset purchase programmes, to 
name two examples. These measures have to 
be regarded at least in large part as a response 
to market developments, otherwise the effect 
ascribed to monetary policy impulses would be 
inaccurate. In other words, instead of attribut -
ing the decline in inflation to the weak de -
mand, it could be wrongly concluded that ex -
pansionary monetary policy leads to falling in -
flationary pressures.
Event studies
One way of roughly quantifying the monetary 
policy impulse is to incorporate the aforemen -
tioned very narrow time windows surrounding 
monetary policy announcements into econo -
metric estimates. In these event studies, the 
monetary impulse is usually measured using a 
short- term market interest rate (often an over -
night index swap rate24). Assuming that abso -
lutely no other relevant information was pub -
lished in the specified period, the change in the 
interest rate measured in that period can be 
attributed solely to the monetary policy an -
nouncement. Assuming further that all previ -
ously published information has already been 
fully processed in financial markets, the change 
in the interest rate can be attributed entirely to 
a departure from the expectations of financial 
market agents, meaning that it reflects a mon -Isolating the

22 Euro exchange rate volatility reached its lowest point in 
2019. Against the G10 currencies, for example, this period 
exhibits the lowest average absolute daily changes in the 
nominal effective exchange rate of the euro since its 
launch. Implied volatilities – a measure of volatility derived 
from options – also reached historical lows in 2019 for key 
bilateral euro exchange rates.
23 The spread of coronavirus has undoubtedly had a nega -
tive impact not just on aggregate demand but also on ag -
gregate supply. On balance, however, the dampening ef -
fect on demand prevailed – at least in the short term – as 
far as price pressures are concerned.
24 These are interest rate swaps whose variable interest 
rate depends on the average overnight interest rate in the

etary policy impulse. As a final step, a simple 
regression can be used, for example, to deter -
mine the quantitative effect of the monetary 
policy impulse on the exchange rate.
An event study such as this on the impact of 
the ECB’s monetary policy announcements on 
the exchange rate of the euro against the US 
dollar, yen and pound sterling finds significant 
effects that are consistent with the theory (see 
p. 32). Thus, a contractionary monetary policy 
impulse is immediately followed by an appreci -
ation of the euro against all three currencies. In 
quantitative terms, this effect is particularly 
pronounced when the monetary policy impulse 
works through medium and long- term interest 
rates. According to the estimate, an impulse 
which increases the yield on five- year German 
government bonds by 10 basis points causes 
the euro to appreciate by around 0.7% against 
the three currencies. In contrast to this, a mon -
etary policy announcement of a comparable 
magnitude which works mainly through short- 
term interest rates only causes the euro to ap -
preciate by just under 0.2% against the US dol -
lar and the pound sterling. Its appreciation 
against the yen is even statistically insignificant 
in this scenario. The results of a time- varying 
estimate also confirm the above assumption 
that the impact of monetary policy impulses on 
the euro exchange rate has grown over time.
These results are relatively similar to those from 
comparable event studies for different curren -
cies and the monetary policy of different cen -
tral banks. According to those studies, a con -
ventional, contractionary monetary policy im -
pulse which increases short- term interest rates 
by 10 basis points leads directly to an appreci -
ation of the domestic currency by between 
0.1% and 0.3%.25 Since, in reality, the move -
ment in the short-  term interest rates used for 
the analysis is barely more than roughly these 
10 basis points in response to a typical policy 
rate adjustment of 25 basis points, the effect 
on the exchange rate appears to be small. 
However, it should be borne in mind, first, that 
expectations of monetary policy decisions have already been formed beforehand in the market, 
which have already influenced the exchange 
rate and market interest rates. The event study 
only identifies the effect of monetary policy de -
cisions above and beyond these expectations. 
Second – as mentioned above – the present 
study shows, amongst other things, that meas -
ures targeting longer- term interest rate devel -
opments, such as asset purchases, have a 
stronger impact on the exchange rate.26
Vector autoregressive (VAR) 
models
A second way of isolating a monetary policy 
impulse is to model the interdependencies be -
tween monetary policy and economic develop -
ments. Estimates of this kind are more complex 
than event studies and require theoretical con -
siderations to be properly applied to the esti -
mation procedure, but can do without minute- 
by- minute data. Unlike event studies, they also 
allow the dynamics of exchange rate responses 
to monetary policy shocks to be depicted. To 
this end, many studies employ vector autore -
gressive (VAR) models,27 often using sign restric-
tions. The procedure can be illustrated using 
the above example of a COVID-  19- induced de -
cline in demand. According to the theory, the 
decline in demand leads to interest rate cuts in 
the money market, reduces economic output 
and has a disinflationary effect. The sign restric -
tions mentioned above can be used to calibrate 
the model such that the estimation only allows 
solutions that necessarily assume such a causal 
relationship. By contrast, an expansionary mon -… shows a sig -

rate adjustments and a “path shock” to cover the future 
path of monetary policy. Hausman and Wongswan (2011) 
predominantly attribute exchange rate movements follow -
ing monetary policy impulses of the Federal Reserve System 
to such “path shocks”.

An event study on the effects of monetary policy impulses 
on the euro’s exchange rate
An event study can be used to quantify the 
effect of monetary policy impulses from the 
euro area on various euro exchange rates. It 
is also possible to examine whether this 
effect  varies over time. This event study 
looks at the changes in euro exchange 
rates, equity prices and interest rates in a 
very narrow time period surrounding the 
ECB’s monetary policy announcements. In 
this way, it attempts to separate the infl  u-
ence of monetary policy impulses on the 
euro’s exchange rate from that of other 
factors . Specifi  cally, all days of monetary 
policy meetings of the ECB Governing 
Council on which a press release was pub-
lished and/ or a press conference was held 
are taken into account. On these days, the 
median of the exchange rate quotations 
and interest rate quotations in the period of 
time between 13:25 and 13:35 and be-
tween 15:40 and 15:50 was determined. 
The change in exchange rates and interest 
rates during this period of time (i.e. the dif-
ference between the two quotations deter-
mined) therefore includes both the immedi-
ate responses to the press release published 
at 13:45 and to the roughly one- hour press 
conference commencing at 14:30.1
In traditional event studies, the measured 
change in interest rates would be inter-
preted as a simple measure of the monetary 
policy impulse. However, more modern 
analyses take into account the fact that 
monetary policy communication is multi- 
faceted: for example, not only can it con-
tain changes in the direct monetary policy 
stance, it can also deliver insights into the 
future monetary policy path and provide 
inform ation on macroeconomic indicators. 
Especially in the latter case, economic effects 
can occur, inter alia, on the exchange rate, which are fundamentally different from 
those of purely monetary policy impulses.2 
If this is not taken into account in the analy-
sis, its results may be distorted.3
In distinguishing between the three aspects 
of monetary policy communication men-
tioned above, the now established method 
of separating them by means of a principal 
component analysis is used.4 Consider
X=F⇤+⌘ ,
where X is a (T ×n) matrix containing the 
changes in n fi  nancial market variables sur-
rounding T ECB monetary policy announce-
ments. In particular, X  here includes the 
changes in one- month, three- month and 
one- year OIS yields,5 two- year, fi  ve- year, 
ten- year and 30- year yields on German 
government bonds and the Euro STOXX 50. 
Using the principal component analysis, X 
should now be reduced to k = 3 unob-
served factors, which describe the changes 
observed in fi  nancial market variables con-
solidated in X as accurately as possible.6 F 
is a (T ×k) matrix with the k = 3 unob-
served factors, Λ is a (k ×n) matrix with the 
corresponding factor loadings, the coeffi   -
cients of the factors, and η is an error term.

Policy Database of Altavilla et al. (2019).

rates are examined in more detail on pp. 42-45.

whose variable interest rate depends on the average

euro area, this is the EONIA).

ket variables surrounding monetary policy decisions by 
the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), for ex-
ample, also with three factors.Deutsche Bundesbank

The factors determined using the principal 
component analysis cannot initially be inter-
preted in a structural manner, i.e. in the 
sense of the three communication aspects. 
This results from a “factor rotation”
Z=FU,
with which, using the (k ×k) matrix U from 
the original factors, F, new, structurally in-
terpretable factors, Z , are calculated.7 The 
matrix U was chosen such that the fi  rst two 
factors lead to an increase in yields and to 
price declines in the equity market, which is 
in line with the theoretical response to a 
contractionary monetary policy impulse. 
They differ in that the fi  rst impulse, known 
as a “target shock”, has a greater impact on 
interest rates for short maturities (one- 
month and three- month yields), while the 
second impulse, a “path shock”, has a 
greater impact on those for longer matur-
ities (from one- year yields).8 The fi  rst mon-
etary policy impulse should, therefore, tend 
to refl  ect conventional monetary policy 
measures, while the second should also re-
fl  ect, inter alia, unconventional measures 
such as forward guidance and asset pur-
chases, which have a greater impact on medium to long- term interest rates. Finally, 
the third factor is intended to refl  ect the 
disclosure of central bank information, 
which, in the event of surprisingly positive 
information, leads to both yield and equity 
price increases.
A measure for the two monetary policy im-
pulses z1,t and z2,t as well as for the impulse 
attributable to new central bank informa-
tion z3,t is then derived from the standard-
ised factors in the relevant columns of the 
matrix Z. Finally, their infl  uence on the 
euro ’s exchange rate can be estimated 
using the following regression equation:
yt=β0+k=3X
i=1βizi,t+"t
 ,
where yt stands for the rate of change of 
the bilateral euro exchange rate against the

other and explain the observed data in the matrix X to 
the same degree as the factors of the matrix F previ-
ously.
8 The sign restrictions are implemented using the algo-
rithm developed by Rubio- Ramírez et al. (2010). The 
appropriate factor rotation is then determined using 
the median target method developed by Fry and Pagan 
(2011).Results of the event studyo

US dollar (or the Japanese yen or the pound 
sterling) within the above- mentioned period 
of just over two hours on days of monetary 
policy decisions.
The table on p. 33 shows the estimation 
results of the event study for the coeffi   -
cients β1 to β3. It shows that monetary 
policy impulses have a statistically signifi  -
cant infl  uence on the three exchange 
rates, but the quantitative effect depends 
on whether interest rates for short or for 
long maturities are more likely to be af-
fected. According to the estimation, the 
latter impulses, in particular, have a signifi  -cant infl  uence on the euro’s exchange 
rate, also from an economic perspective. 
For example, an impulse that increases the 
yield on fi  ve- year German government 
bonds by 10 basis points leads to an ap-
preciation of the euro from 0.62% against 
the pound sterling to 0.77% against the 
Japanese yen.9 By contrast, impulses attrib-
utable to new central bank information do 
not immediately have a signifi  cant effect 
on any of the three euro exchange rates. 
One reason for this could be that the im-
pact of such information impulses in for-
eign exchange markets is more complex 
than purely monetary policy impulses and 
thus takes longer than the just over two 
hours considered here to  be refl  ected in 
exchange rate movements.10
The event study presented here assumes 
thus far that the infl  uence of monetary pol-
icy impulses does not change over time. 
However, particularly as a result of the con-
vergence towards key interest rates of 0% 
or below and the use of unconventional 
monetary policy measures that this entails, 
the transmission of monetary policy to ex-
change rates might have changed. Whether 
this is actually the case or not can be tested 
using an estimation with time- varying coef-
fi  cients, βi,t:
yt=β0,t+k=3X
i=1βi,tzi,t+"t
However, this equation cannot be esti-
mated without further assumptions, as the 
number of coeffi   cients exceeds the number 
of observations. One method of dealing 
9 Such a stronger effect of monetary policy impulses 
which work mainly through interest rates with longer 
maturities is also found, for instance, by Hausman and 
Wongswan (2011).
10 In line with this, when using daily exchange rate 
changes, there is a signifi  cant effect of information im-
pulses on various euro exchange rates. See Kerssenfi  s-
cher (2019).Estimation of the monetary policy effect

with this problem is a kernel estimation, 
where at any point in time τ = 1, …,T  all 
observations are assigned a weight. In this 
case, the kernel follows a normal distribu-
tion, meaning that the further the observa-
tion is from τ , the lower the weight as-
signed.11
The chart on p. 34 and the adjacent chart 
show the evolution of the estimated values 
for the coeffi   cients of the two monetary 
policy shocks over time. Especially in the 
case of monetary policy impulses that have 
an impact on interest rates on government 
bonds with a medium and long- term re-
sidual maturity, the infl  uence on euro ex-
change rates appears to have increased 
over time. At least since the use of explicit 
forward guidance from mid- 2013 onwards 
and the launch of the public sector pur-
chase programme (PSPP) in early 2015, un-
conventional monetary policy measures 
might have caused this development.12 
However, a corresponding trend can al-
ready be observed from the beginning of 
the observation period. Moreover, such a 
stronger response of euro exchange rates 
over time can likewise be seen, although to 
a lesser extent, in monetary policy measures 
which mainly have an impact on short ma-
turities.
Another explanation could be the down-
ward trend in interest rates observed world-
wide. For example, interest rates might 
have been transmitted only to a lesser ex-
tent internationally since central banks’ 
room for interest policy manoeuvre has 
tended to diminish over time. In this case, 
uncovered interest parity would predict 
larger exchange rate adjustments. Techno-
logical progress might also have led to in-
formation being priced into the market 
more quickly, for example, through in-
creased algorithmic trading.13 The response 
period selected here of just over two hours 11 The actual weighting of the individual observations 
depends on the choice of bandwidth, h . The higher 
the bandwidth selected, the higher temporally more 
distant observations are weighted, meaning that, as h 
increases, there is convergence towards the linear case 
with coeffi   cients which are constant over time. The 
choice of h here follows the optimisation method de-
veloped by Ang and Kristensen (2012). The same esti-
mation method is also applied by Ferrari et al. (2017) 
to exchange rate changes following monetary policy 
announcements.
12 For a detailed discussion of the effect of the asset 
purchase programmes on the euro’s exchange rate, 
see Deutsche Bundesbank (2017). This also shows that 
particularly the announcements regarding the pur-
chase programme caused major movements in the for-
eign exchange markets.

etary policy impulse has a stimulating effect on 
the economy by lowering interest rates, thus 
raising the price level. These responses, too, 
can be imposed on the estimation using sign 
restrictions. Since the two impulses, falling de -
mand and a monetary policy easing, are as -
sumed to have different effects, they can be 
clearly distinguished from one another.
If, in addition to the monetary policy impulse, a 
VAR model then identifies other impulses, such 
as a real economic impulse, it is possible to cal -
culate the extent to which these impulses have 
caused the historical development of the euro 
exchange rate, according to the model esti -
mate. This kind of historical decomposition of 
the development of the euro/  US dollar ex -
change rate suggests, amongst other things, 
that monetary policy is largely responsible for 
the euro’s weakness from mid- 2014 onwards 
(see the box on pp. 37 ff.). The euro/ US dollar 
exchange rate was depressed not only by the 
expansion of asset purchases in the euro area, but also later by the Federal Reserve’s gradual 
policy rate hike. The euro partially recovered in 
2017, not least owing to the tapering of the 
Eurosystem’s net asset purchases, but the US 
dollar was supported by the US economy, 
which had been booming up until the corona -
virus crisis. Generally speaking, such historical 
decompositions are a useful analytical tool, 
precisely because they also make it possible to 
quantify the individual contributions of the im -
pulses. Nevertheless, it should be noted that 
VAR models isolate just a limited number of 
such impulses,28 meaning that they can only 
depict complex dynamics, for instance in the 
event of extreme events such as the corona -
virus crisis, to a limited extent.From mid- 2014, 
weak euro 
largely due to 
monetary policy 
impulsesfor the fi  rst few years might then be too 
short to fully capture the effects of monet-
ary policy measures. Ultimately, the fre-
quency of monetary policy meetings of the 
ECB Governing Council could play a role: in 
the fi  rst three years after the launch of the 
euro, monetary policy decisions were taken 
every two weeks; between 2002 and 2014 
they were taken every four weeks; and 
since 2015 they have only been taken every 
six weeks. It is conceivable that this de-
creasing frequency of meetings of the ECB 
Governing Council has increased the aver-
age strength of certain impulses over time. 
If euro exchange rates additionally respond 
disproportionately to larger shocks, this 
could also help explain the phenomenon of 
an increasing infl  uence of monetary policy 
on euro exchange rates. However, such 
non- linearities are not the subject of this 
study, and a glance at the data fails to pro-
vide any defi  nitive evidence of the possible increasing strength of monetary policy im-
pulses.14
14 Not surprisingly, the strength of monetary policy 
impulses which have a stronger impact on interest 
rates with short maturities has declined, while the 
strength of monetary policy impulses which have a 
stronger impact on interest rates with medium and 
long- term maturities has increased.
28 In principle, the number of impulses is unlimited. How -
ever, the calculation intensity for identification using sign 
restrictions increases exponentially, which means that, in 
practice, models will rarely include more than five different 
impulses.Deutsche Bundesbank

Determinants of the cumulative change in the 
euro- US dollar exchange rate: a historical decomposition 
in a VAR model
When analysing the causes of movements 
in the euro- US dollar exchange rate, it 
should be borne in mind that the various 
determinants can affect the exchange rate 
not only immediately but also with a time 
lag. Information on the historical (lagged 
and non- lagged) determinants of the euro 
exchange rate is provided by an analytical 
procedure known as historical decompos-
ition from a structural vector autoregressive 
(VAR) model. This procedure decomposes 
the euro- US dollar exchange rate move-
ments into the contributions of the deter-
minants identifi  ed in the model; the im-
pulses they impart to the economy are 
termed “structural shocks” in this context. 
In order to calculate these shocks, such as 
the impulses generated by the Eurosystem’s 
monetary policy over a given period of 
time, theory- based assumptions are made 
as to the direction in which they act on the 
economic variables observed in the VAR 
model over the same period (the shocks are 
“identifi  ed” by means of “sign restrictions”). 
The VAR model used here incorporates vari-
ables from two currency areas: the euro 
area and the United States.1
In mathematical terms, for a reduced- form 
VAR model with n variables, one of which is 
the euro- US dollar exchange rate, the fol-
lowing equation is to be estimated:
yt=c+B1yt1+...+Bpytp+ut ,
where yt is the ( n ×1) vector of the en-
dogenous variables, c  is the ( n ×1) vector 
of the constants, Bi is the ( n ×n) coeffi   -
cients matrix of the endogenous variables 
lagged by i = 1, …, p periods and ut is the 
(n ×1) vector of the error terms. As usual, ut is normally distributed, with E (ut) = 0  
and E( utut/prime) = /summation.text assumed.
A special feature of this VAR model is that 
weekly fi  nancial market data are used as 
variables for the estimation instead of the 
monthly or quarterly macroeconomic data 
which are often used otherwise.2 This lends 
the analysis a maximum of timeliness, which 
is of major interest, especially when looking 
at fi  nancial market variables such as the ex-
change rate. A total of fi  ve variables are in-
corporated into the model (and thus into 
vector yt): the euro- US dollar rate, the Euro 
Stoxx 50 index, the S&P 500 index and the 
yields on ten- year Bunds and on ten- year 
US Treasuries. The model is estimated for 
the period since the introduction of the 
euro until mid- August 2020 using the least 
squares method and a maximum lag of 
p/uni00A0= /uni00A05  weeks, selected using the Akaike 
Informa tion Criterion (AIC).
Although the coeffi   cients (c, B1, …, Bp) 
and the covariance matrix of the reduced- 
form VAR model, /summation.text , can be estimated 
without any problems, it is not possible to 
interpret the identifi  ed error terms, ut, as 
structural shocks, as these error terms are 
correlated with one another. The VAR 
model is therefore converted into a struc-
tural form by imposing sign restrictions on 
the impulse- response functions, which 
allows an economic interpretation of the in-
1 The basic idea behind the model used here is to build 
on the approaches of Matheson and Stavrev (2014) as 
well as Farrant and Peersman (2006).
2 Not only are many types of macroeconomic data 
published only monthly or even quarterly, they are also 
often published only with a long time lag, which 
makes it diffi   cult or virtually impossible to investigate 
current developments using these data.Deutsche Bundesbank

dividual shocks.3 In the present VAR model, 
a total of four structural shocks and one 
residual  shock are identifi  ed in this manner, 
the sign restrictions of which are given in 
the table above.
The model distinguishes between monetary 
policy shocks and other macroeconomic 
shocks, as well as between shocks originat-
ing in the euro area and those emanating 
from the United States. It is assumed that a 
contractionary monetary policy shock and a 
positive macroeconomic shock (e.g. the 
publication of surprisingly positive eco-
nomic data) will both lead to a rise in do-
mestic interest rates and thus to an appreci-
ation of the domestic currency. However, 
the two shocks differ in terms of their im-
pact on the stock market: a positive macro-
economic shock is assumed to increase the 
valuation of domestic equities, whereas the 
contractionary monetary policy shock will 
reduce the dividend discount value of equi-
ties through a deterioration in the economic 
outlook and a higher discount factor. In 
order to be able to additionally disentangle 
euro area shocks from US shocks, it is as-
sumed that the United States, as the world’s 
most important economy, plays a pivotal 
role in the global fi  nancial system inasmuch 
as changes in US interest rates are transmit-
ted to euro area interest rates.4 This means that both a positive macroeconomic US 
shock and a contractionary US monetary 
policy shock, each taken in isolation, will 
push up interest rates not only in the United 
States but also in Germany. Since it is as-
sumed, however, that the interest rate hike 
in the United States will be passed through 
less than proportionately and that the in-
crease will therefore remain larger there 
than in Europe, both shocks cause the euro 
to depreciate against the US dollar (see 
“uncovered interest parity”). Ultimately, a 
minimum number of sign restrictions are as-
signed to the residual shock in order to dif-
ferentiate it clearly from the other shocks 
and thus not diminish its explanatory power.
The chart on p. 39 shows the historical de-
composition of the euro- US dollar exchange 
rate. The black line indicates its cumulative 
percentage change since the end of 2013. 
The differently shaded areas refl  ect the re-
spective contributions of the shocks identi-
fi  ed in the model to the change in the euro- 
US dollar exchange rate. It can be seen 
that, from the end of 2013 – when the euro

was still trading at close to US$1.40 – up to 
the ﬁ  rst quarter of 2015, the euro had lost 
nearly 25% of its value against the US dol-
lar. The historical decomposition suggests 
that a large part of this was due to an ac-
commodative monetary policy stance in the 
euro area. Important announcements and 
decisions on the Eurosystem’s bond pur-
chase programmes were made during this 
period, in particular including the adoption 
of the expanded asset purchase programme 
(APP). It is true that there was initially an 
easing of the downward pressure on the 
euro against the US dollar as the year pro-
gressed. From the end of 2015, however, 
the positive outlook for the US economy 
encouraged the Federal Reserve to raise the 
fed funds rate in increments again. Taken in 
isolation, this strengthened the US dollar. 
According to the analysis, the monetary 
policy stance on both sides of the Atlantic 
led, at the end of 2016, to the euro falling 
to its lowest level against the US dollar since 
2002.
The euro subsequently recovered signiﬁ  -
cantly, however, mainly supported by the 
gradual tapering of the net asset purchases 
by the Eurosystem. This perceived contrac-
tionary effect of monetary policy persisted into 2019. Nevertheless, from as early as 
the end of 2017, the upward tendency of 
the euro this originally triggered was al-
ready being thwarted by steady US eco-
nomic growth during this period, along 
with other factors. This is reﬂ  ected in an in-
creasing importance of the US macroeco-
nomic shock (see the chart above). Placing 
an additional strain on the euro was the 
somewhat gloomier economic outlook on 
the other side of the Atlantic, as evidenced 
by the intensifying effect of the macroeco-
nomic shock from the euro area. On bal-
ance, this caused the euro to trend down-
ward moderately but continuously up to 
end- 2019.
The model also provides clues about the 
causes of current exchange rate develop-
ments during the coronavirus crisis. Since 
the euro area is more closely interconnected 
with China – the ﬁ  rst country to be affected 
by the novel coronavirus  – than the US 
economy is, the euro area economic out-
look began to deteriorate as early as Janu-
ary 2020, putting downward pressure on 
the euro against the US dollar. Monetary 
policy impulses from the euro area were 
also weighing on the euro during this 
period. However, with the global spread of Historical decomposition of the euro-US dollar exchange rate

the virus, this was increasingly counteracted 
by the similarly deteriorating outlook for 
growth in the United States. At the end of 
February, according to the estimation re-
sults, the contribution of euro area monet-
ary policy area did a sudden about- face 
towards  supporting the euro. This may have 
been due to market participants seeing the 
Eurosystem, with a main refi  nancing rate of 
0% and a deposit rate of -0.5%, as having 
barely any room left for any further interest 
rate cuts compared with other central 
banks. However, beginning with the an-
nouncement of the pandemic emergency 
purchase programme (PEPP), upward pres-
sure on the euro being applied by euro area 
monetary policy gradually subsided from 
the second half of March. By contrast, the 
US Federal Reserve had only just begun to 
cut its rates again following multiple policy 
rate hikes in the second half of the previous 
year. This gave the Federal Reserve the lee-
way it needed to lower the fed funds rate 
several times in response to the spread of 
the COVID- 19 pandemic. On balance, US 
monetary policy was, at this stage, applying 
pressure on the euro to appreciate against 
the US dollar, unlike before the crisis. To-
ward the end of the observation horizon, 
both macroeconomic shocks also support 
the euro against the US dollar, presumably 
owing to differences between the two cur-
rency areas regarding the speed at which 
the pandemic spread and the associated 
revisions  to the respective economic out-
look.
It should be borne in mind, however, that 
such an analysis – as is usual in economics – 
rests on a large number of assumptions and 
should therefore be interpreted with cau-
tion. This is particularly true for the current 
year, as the COVID- 19 pandemic ushered in 
developments, especially in the equity mar-
kets, which are diffi   cult to model, and a 
model based solely on fi  nancial market vari-ables cannot adequately represent the at-
tendant complex dynamics of supply and 
demand shocks. Particularly in crisis situ-
ations, investors, irrespective of interest rate 
developments, temporarily shift funds to 
“safe haven” currencies such as the US dol-
lar, which is something the present VAR 
model cannot adequately capture. On the 
whole, however, such historical decompos-
itions from VAR models can be a useful 
avenue  to understanding exchange rate 
movements.Deutsche Bundesbank

Proxy VAR models
And finally, methodological refinements over 
the past few years now allow estimates in 
which monetary policy impulses are, like in 
event studies, isolated at very high frequency 
surrounding monetary policy announcements 
by altering variables, and a dynamic exchange 
rate response can nevertheless be determined 
using a VAR model.29 Interestingly, first studies 
that apply this method confirm the theoretical 
idea that exchange rates “overshoot” almost 
immediately after monetary policy impulses.30 
It is worth highlighting this result as many stud -
ies with VAR models find only a lagged “over -
shooting” of exchange rates following monet -
ary policy impulses.31
Although a very short- term definition of events 
that are relevant from a monetary policy per -
spective is used in an attempt to isolate a mon -
etary policy impulse as exactly as possible, the 
question remains as to how successful this is in 
such event studies. This would be the case if 
the interest rate changes observed in the mar -
ket during monetary policy announcements or 
shortly thereafter really are completely caused 
by monetary policy impulses in the stricter 
sense. This is not necessarily the case, however. 
Alongside the monetary policy decision, central 
banks regularly also communicate (explicitly or 
implicitly) additional information on their as -
sessment of the economic situation and the 
outlook for the economy and for inflation.32 If 
interest rates rise in the minutes following a 
monetary policy decision, this could equally be 
because, for instance, the central bank has 
communicated unexpectedly upbeat economic 
prospects. However, the effects of such infor -
mation impulses are fundamentally different 
from those of genuine monetary policy im -
pulses. Rather than depressing prices and eco -
nomic output, the usual response to a contrac -
tionary monetary policy impulse, the rise in 
interest rates in the markets triggered by the 
brighter economic prospects is, in this case, ac -
tually associated with rising output and appre -
ciating prices. The macroeconomic responses are therefore more comparable to those of a 
demand impulse.33
Interest rate increases triggered by information 
impulses also have a different effect on ex -
change rates than pure monetary policy im -
pulses – as demonstrated by a new Bundes -
bank study34 (see pp. 42 ff.). If the ECB commu -
nication following one of its monetary policy 
meetings triggers a pure monetary policy im -
pulse, this results in an “overshooting” of al -
most all examined bilateral euro exchange rates 
in line with the predictions of the Dornbusch 
model.35 In the case of a positive information 
impulse, meanwhile, where the central bank 
communication improves the economic out -
look, the response of euro exchange rates dif -
fers depending on the partner currency.
Despite the increase in interest rates at home, 
the euro depreciates in some instances, for ex -
ample against the Australian dollar or the Nor -
wegian krone. According to the results of the 
study, this has to do with the fact that the in -
formation impulse also has a considerable, 
positive impact on investors’ global appetite for 
risk. Irrespective of interest rate developments, 
demand for speculative currencies, in particu -
lar, is high when markets experience rising risk Combination of

29 In such an approach, the change in an interest rate at

nouncements is used as a proxy for the actual monetary 
policy impulse. The underlying idea behind these proxy VAR

similarity to an instrument variable approach, was de -

The impact of central bank communication 
on the euro exchange rate
Analyses of high- frequency data surround-
ing monetary policy meetings often identify 
a co- movement of yields and equity prices. 
Theoretically, though, a contractionary 
monetary policy “shock” ought to drive 
yields higher, clouding the economic out-
look and raising the discount factor. Both of 
these impacts imply that equity prices 
should fall and thus that equity prices and 
yields should move in opposite directions. 
The observed co- movement of yields and 
equity prices can, however, be explained by 
shocks triggered by new central bank infor-
mation. These are primarily impulses which 
occur when fi  nancial market agents change 
their view of the general economic situ-
ation or of certain macroeconomic variables 
in response to communication from the 
central bank. Specifi  cally, central bank com-
munication on short and longer- term fore-
casts of macroeconomic variables could 
give rise to impulses of this kind.1 Not only 
are these central bank information shocks, 
as they are known, a frequent occurrence 
following announcements by the ECB or 
the Federal Reserve;2 they also have al-
together different implications for the econ-
omy than those triggered by pure monetary 
policy shocks.3
A recently published Bundesbank discussion 
paper investigates the impact of these cen-
tral bank information shocks as well as the 
effect of pure monetary policy shocks on 
the euro exchange rate using a vector au-
toregressive (VAR) model.4 This VAR model 
uses a total of eight variables as inputs. 
From the euro area, these are two- year 
yields on German government bonds, the 
EURO STOXX  50 index, industrial output, 
the consumer price index and a bank credit 
spread.5 To capture the international di-
mension, foreign consumer prices as well as two- year yields and the euro nominal ex-
change rate are used.6 The estimate is 
based on data from January 1999 to Sep-
tember 2018.7 The reduced- form VAR 
model is estimated with Bayesian tech-
niques.
In methodological terms, an approach 
known as a proxy VAR is used to disentan-
gle, as far as possible, the two shocks ob-
served in the model – the pure monetary 
policy shock and the central bank informa-
tion shock – from other infl  uences.8 Short- 
term responses by yields on two- year Ger-
man government bonds and the EURO 
STOXX  50 index are observed, as in an 
1 Romer and Romer (2000) already tested for the ex-
istence of asymmetric information between the Fed-
eral Reserve and the public in infl  ation forecasting and 
demonstrated that monetary policy announcements 
provide signals for commercial forecasts. Expanding on 
this fi  nding, Nakamura and Steinsson (2018) fi  nd evi-
dence for an increase in professional forecasts of out-
put growth following an unexpected rise in the real 
interest rate triggered by announcements by the 
Federal  Open Market Committee; they label this a “Fed 
information effect.”
2 See Cieslak and Schrimpf (2019).
3 See Jarociński and Karadi (2020).
4 See Franz (2020). A more formal presentation of the 
VAR model can be found on p. 37.
5 The bank credit spread is taken from Gilchrist and 
Mojon (2018) and denotes the difference in yields be-
tween bonds issued by commercial banks in the euro 
area and German government bonds. The spread aims 
to describe time- varying risk premia as a way of better 
approximating fi  rms’ and households’ actual funding 
costs in the euro area. Gertler and Karadi (2015) sup-
port the inclusion of a variable of this kind since mon-
etary policy measures can have a self- reinforcing effect 
on funding costs through these premia.
6 The VAR model is estimated, fi  rst, against 12 major 
trading partners such that the foreign variables are in-
putted in trade- weighted terms but, second, also bilat-
erally against the G10 currencies with the exception of 
Switzerland.
7 The maximum number of lags in the VAR model is 
set to 12 as is common for monthly data.
8 Since only two shocks are examined here, partial 
identifi  cation of the VAR model is suffi   cient. See Stock 
and Watson (2012) and Mertens and Ravn (2013) for 
an explanation of the workings of the proxy VAR

event study.9 This is done in a narrow win-
dow surrounding central bank announce-
ments following monetary policy meetings 
of the ECB Governing Council.10 These 
short- term yield and price responses are 
collated to form time series, which are then 
inputted into the model as proxies. It is 
thought that these responses capture the 
pure monetary policy shock and central 
bank information shock well if no further 
information that has a bearing on the ag-
gregate economy was released during the 
period of the measured response and the 
two shocks largely cover the surprises from 
the ECB statement.11 To ensure that this is 
the case, interest rate and price responses 
on days of monetary policy meetings of the 
ECB Governing Council were measured over 
a fairly short period of time, starting ten 
minutes before publication of the ECB press 
release at 13:45 CET and ending 20 minutes 
after the end of the press conference sched-
uled for 14:30 CET.
As a fi  nal step, the pure monetary policy 
shock then needs to be disentangled from 
the central bank information shock. This is 
done by additionally applying the sign re-
strictions mentioned above to the model. It 
is presumed that a contractionary monetary policy shock will raise domestic government 
bond yields and lower equity prices, while a 
positive central bank information shock will 
increase both yields and equity prices.12
The above chart shows how the effective 
exchange rate of the euro against 12 major 
trading partners responds to a positive cen-
tral bank information shock and a contrac-
tionary monetary policy shock as impulse 
response functions. The shocks are normal-
ised in terms of their magnitude such that 
the yield on German government bonds 
with a two- year residual maturity immedi-
ately responds with a 10 basis point in-
crease. In the pure monetary policy shock, 
the rise in the interest rate leads to an eco-
nomically and statistically signifi  cant appre-
ciation of the effective exchange rate of the 
euro. The response is strongest at fi  rst 
(0.7%) and diminishes over time. This ob-
servation is consistent with the theoretical

11 Expressed in technical terms, valid restrictions can 
be obtained for identifi  cation if the proxies, much like 
an instrument variable estimation, are suffi   ciently cor-
related with the structural shocks of interest, but not 
with other possible structural shocks in the model.

framework of the Dornbusch model.13 The 
central bank information shock, by con-
trast, does not trigger a statistically signifi  -
cant response by the effective exchange 
rate of the euro, despite the increase in the 
domestic interest rate.
To fi  nd out why the effective exchange rate 
of the euro responds differently to the two 
shocks, it is worth taking a look at bilateral 
euro exchange rates, specifi  cally by estimat-
ing the VAR model for the euro exchange 
rate separately against each of the curren-
cies listed in the above table,14 which shows 
how the euro exchange rate immediately 
responded against each currency. As the 
table shows, the euro appreciated against 
all the currencies following a pure monetary 
policy shock, and did so in a statistically and 
economically signifi  cant manner, except against the Swedish krona. A central bank 
information shock, by contrast, elicited a 
very mixed response from the euro, de-
pending on the partner currency concerned. 
As a case in point, the euro is estimated to 
appreciate very strongly against the yen, 
say, (by 1.6%), but lose value against other 
currencies, such as the New Zealand dollar 
(by 0.5% in this case).
What could be behind this distinctly mixed 
exchange rate response to central bank in-
formation shocks? Research on this matter 
suggests that different responses by the re-
spective interest rate differential between 
the euro area and the country of the part-
ner currency are not the main cause.15 
Things look more promising when the cur-
rencies under investigation are classifi  ed by 
the role they each play in the foreign ex-
change market (see the right- hand column 
of the table).16 Analysis based on this classi-
fi  cation approach identifi  es the low- yielding 
yen as a currency that is used to fund 
invest ment strategies such as currency 
carry  trades. Investments in currencies of 
commodity- exporting countries such as 
Australia or Norway, on the other hand, 
have often carried higher rates of interest in 
the past, making them generally attractive 
to speculative investors. On the whole, it 
can be said that net capital fl  ows into 
speculative currencies increase as global risk 
appetite picks up, subjecting them to up-
13 See Dornbusch (1976).
14 These are all the G10 currencies except the Swiss 
franc. Between September 2011 and January 2015, the 
Swiss National Bank pursued an exchange rate policy 
which prevented the Swiss franc from falling below a 
minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro. As a 
result of this policy action, the Swiss franc was not free 
fl  oating across a signifi  cant part of the period under 
observation. This complicated a comparison with the 
euro exchange rates of the other currencies, which is 
why the Swiss franc is disregarded here.

ward pressure, whereas currencies used as 
safe havens, for hedging and to fund carry 
trades tend to depreciate as global risk ap-
petite grows. If, then, it can be demon-
strated that the risk appetite of global in-
vestors increases in response to a positive 
central bank information shock, this would 
make sense of the mixed response shown 
by various bilateral euro exchange rates to 
this particular type of shock.
The last row in the table shows the immedi-
ate response of the VIX index (which is a 
measure of the implied volatility of S&P 500 
index options) to monetary policy and cen-
tral bank information shocks. The VIX index 
is often used as an indicator of global risk 
appetite, with a decline signifying a rise in 
investors’ risk appetite.17 Following a posi-
tive central bank information shock, the es-
timate does indeed identify an immediate 
sharp rise in risk appetite, which ought to 
benefi  t speculative currencies. It is not sur-
prising, then, that the euro depreciates 
against the very currencies that are classi-
fi  ed as speculative or, at least, does not ap-
preciate signifi  cantly against them. What is 
likely, though, is that the rise in risk appetite 
triggered by the positive central bank infor-
mation shock will weigh on the exchange 
rates of currencies used to fund carry trades. 
And the analysis does indeed fi  nd that the 
euro gains in value against the US dollar 
and the yen, two currencies that belong to 
this category when classifi  ed according to 
this scheme. A pure monetary policy shock 
elicits a far weaker response by the VIX 
index than a central bank information 
shock, which is why the reduced risk appe-
tite estimated in this case has no major 
bearing on euro exchange rates.
The analysis implies that central bank infor-
mation shocks materialising concurrently 
with monetary policy shocks need to be 
borne in mind when investigating how monetary policy impulses impact on the 
euro’s exchange rate. This is because the 
two shocks have substantially different 
effects  on exchange rates. As a result, an 
estimation that disregards central bank in-
formation shocks might yield a distorted 
picture of the effect of monetary policy im-
pulses on the euro’s exchange rate.
17 The response by the VIX index shown in the table is 
derived from an estimation of the VAR model as de-
scribed above, with the S&P 500 index and the VIX 
index serving as additional inputs.Deutsche Bundesbank

appetite.36 These frequently include the curren -
cies of commodity- exporting countries, like the 
Australian dollar and the Norwegian krone 
mentioned above. It is consequently not sur -
prising that the euro depreciates against these 
currencies in particular in response to a positive 
information impulse.
Conversely, a positive information impulse 
causes the euro to appreciate against other 
currencies, the US dollar or the yen, say. This 
appreciation appears to be strongest against 
currencies that tend to be in demand in times 
of high risk aversion. Unlike positive informa -
tion impulses, purely contractionary monetary 
policy impulses do not lower risk aversion; if 
anything they increase it. As this effect appears 
to be relatively small, however, adjustments in 
investors’ attitude to risk play no more than a 
secondary role in terms of pure monetary pol -
icy impulses.
Effect of non- standard 
monetary  policy
Finally, in recent years, research has also fo -
cused on the question of how exchange rates 
respond to non- standard monetary policy 
measures, such as many central banks’ asset 
purchase programmes or the use of forward 
guidance.37 In particular, the following two 
theoretical transmission channels are being dis -
cussed. The portfolio rebalancing channel 
states that an expansion of central bank asset 
purchases in the secondary market will boost 
the prices of long- term bonds, thereby lower -
ing their yields. Some investors will therefore 
restructure their own portfolio to include more 
foreign assets, amongst other things. The re -
sulting capital outflows lead to a depreciation 
of the domestic currency. By contrast, the sig -
nalling channel acts by influencing investors’ 
formation of expectations. The news of an ex -
pansion in asset purchases suggests a longer-  
term expansionary stance, which means that 
the expected level of future short- term interest 
rates will also adjust downwards. This will therefore again lead to a depreciation of the 
domestic currency.
Empirical studies on non- standard monetary 
policy measures usually identify an economic -
ally and statistically significant effect on the ex -
change rate in the direction predicted by the -
ory. The exchange rate effects identified in 
many studies are comparable in terms of their 
magnitude to those of conventional monetary 
policy.38 However, some even consider the ef -
fect of non- standard measures to be greater.39 
This result may, however, be partly attributable 
to the fact that the sensitivity of exchange rates 
to monetary policy impulses has grown over 
time, as shown above.40 Although most studies 
on non- standard monetary policy measures 
look at the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, 
there is certainly also evidence of a similar 
transmission to the exchange rate for the Euro -
system, especially in relation to the euro/ US 
dollar exchange rate.41 For other currency pairs, 
meanwhile, the effects appear to be fairly het -
erogeneous.42 It can generally be concluded 
that exchange rates appear to be influenced by 
both long- term and short- term interest rate 
changes. It is therefore not surprising that non- 
standard monetary policy impulses are a signifi -
cant factor in foreign exchange markets at 
times when short- term interest rates are 0%, 
given their impact on the longer end of the 
yield curve.… and appreci -

ciation of the euro against the US dollar.

Conclusion
Monetary policy impulses have a significant im -
pact on euro exchange rate developments. 
From a theoretical perspective alone, interest 
rate differentials are, alongside the price level, 
a key factor in determining the exchange rate. 
However, empirical evidence also suggests that 
the Eurosystem, for example, has a decisive in -
fluence on the exchange rate of the euro 
through its influence on the yield curve. Several 
analyses using very different methods evidence 
the large importance of monetary policy an -
nouncements for the exchange rate of the 
euro. It is consequently not surprising that 
some of the euro’s largest single- day gains and 
losses are the result of just such monetary pol -
icy events. There are also signs that this influ -
ence has actually even intensified over time.
However, quantifying the effect of monetary 
policy impulses on euro exchange rates is prov -
ing complicated. For example, it is methodo -
logically difficult to clearly identify a monetary 
policy impulse. In recent years, however, con -
siderable progress has been made in quantify -
ing monetary policy impulses and analysing 
their effects on exchange rates, mainly through 
the development of new statistical methods 
and the wider availability of high- frequency 
finan cial market data.Another challenge is that monetary policy com -
munication may also contain information that 
is relevant to financial markets but that does 
not directly relate to monetary policy but more 
to the economic outlook, say. Looking at the 
exchange rate of the euro, however, the effects 
of such information impulses differ significantly 
from those of pure monetary policy impulses 
and also vary considerably depending on which 
exchange rate pair is considered.
The results presented here suggest that a mon -
etary policy impulse by the Eurosystem that 
raises the yield on five- year German govern -
ment bonds by 10 basis points leads to an im -
mediate appreciation of the euro against the 
US dollar, the yen and the pound sterling by 
around 0.7% in each case. By contrast, the es -
timated appreciation is much smaller on aver -
age if the monetary policy impulse works 
mainly through short- term interest rates. How -
ever, this result may have been partly caused by 
the general rise in the influence of monetary 
policy impulses on the euro. The analyses pre -
sented here also show that this impact has 
been considerable in recent years in terms of 
the euro/ US dollar exchange rate, also com -
pared with other macroeconomic factors. This 
suggests that monetary policy communication 
should not lose sight of the potential effects on 
the exchange rate of the euro.

Global financial interconnectedness and 
spillovers between the G20 countries
Even after the global financial crisis of 2008-09, the international interconnectedness of national 
financial systems continued to deepen, albeit at a slower pace than before. The extent to which 
the coronavirus pandemic has influenced this trend can only be assessed in greater detail once a 
certain amount of time has passed. Despite this, the pandemic has once again emphatically 
raised the question of the extent to which the deepening interconnectedness between financial 
systems has changed advanced and emerging market economies’ susceptibility to shocks.
A look at the development of global capital flows and their volatility shows that an abrupt out -
flow or reversal of capital flows can pose significant challenges, particularly for countries with 
less developed financial systems. As demonstrated by the global financial crisis, however, finan -
cial crises and the risk of contagion are not problems that affect only emerging market econ -
omies. As open economies are interconnected in financial and real economic terms, shocks in 
one country can also have an impact on other countries, which can in turn have feedback effects 
on the country in which the shock originated. To an increasing degree, this also applies to the 
relationships between advanced economies and emerging market economies. The analysis of 
spillover effects in the equity markets of the G20 countries shows that spillovers from advanced 
economies to emerging market economies continue to surpass those from emerging market 
economies to advanced economies. It is also shown that spillover effects can rise sharply and 
abruptly during periods of stress, such as the present phase triggered by the outbreak of the 
COVID-  19 pandemic. Furthermore, the COVID-  19 pandemic has also revealed increased vulner -
abilities in individual G20 emerging market economies.
First and foremost, this has presented substantial challenges to national economic policy. Along -
side stability- oriented economic policy, the further expansion of local capital markets, the build- 
up of foreign currency reserves and the implementation of macroprudential measures are appro -
priate for containing these vulnerabilities. Capital flow measures can also help to ensure financial 
stability. However, national policy measures alone are not always sufficient to combat the nega -
tive repercussions of highly volatile capital flows. In such cases, assistance from the international 
community, such as financial support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), can supple -
ment national efforts.Deutsche Bundesbank

Development of cross- border 
capital flows
The international interconnectedness of finan -
cial systems has risen considerably since the 
1980s. While the majority of international cap -
ital flows still take place between advanced 
economies, the share of capital flows attribut -
able to emerging market economies has risen 
to a globally significant level. This development 
has been driven by advances in information 
and communication technologies, which have 
made it considerably easier to transfer assets 
across borders. In addition, emerging market 
economies have sought to take advantage of 
the benefits of international capital flows by 
opening up and developing their financial mar -
kets, which had previously been closed.
Capital flows can have a positive impact on the 
recipient country if foreign capital is used to 
fund investment and stimulate economic 
growth. Furthermore, an international disper -
sion of financial assets allows investors to pur -
chase higher- yielding assets as well as to better 
diversify risks and thereby reduce the total risk 
of investment.
However, for emerging market economies in 
particular, inflows and outflows of capital can 
often present major challenges to financial sta -
bility, especially if the capital flows exhibit a 
high level of volatility. In relatively underdevel -
oped institutional environments, sudden stops 
in inflows or sharp rises in outflows can more 
quickly result in financial and currency crises, 
sometimes at considerable cost to the affected 
countries. However, very sharp increases in in -
flows can also pose challenges to macroeco -
nomic and financial stability.
In order to more effectively identify potential 
vulnerabilities, the analysis of capital flows has 
changed in recent years. Up until the global 
finan cial crisis, analyses had centred mostly on 
net capital flows; since then, the focus has 
shifted to gross capital flows. Here, it should be 
noted that the gross flows have already been netted out and therefore may also have nega -
tive values.1 This change in focus is due, 
amongst other reasons, to the fact that both 
components of the net figure – gross inflows 
from non- resident investors and gross outflows 
from resident investors – are generally larger 
and more volatile than net inflows. They can 
thus be indicative of spillover effects and vul -
nerabilities that, due to netting, are not neces -
sarily reflected in equivalent changes in net 
capital flows. In addition, looking at gross fig -
ures allows for an analysis of different behav -
ioural patterns between resident and non-  
resident investors. For example, the economic 
policy implications of strong net capital inflows 
can differ depending on whether these inflows 
are the result of increased investment from 
abroad or the repatriation of funds by resident 
investors.2
The development of capital flows is shown in 
the balance of payments data for the G20 
countries (see the chart on p. 55).3 In this con -
text, the strongest growth in gross capital flows 
worldwide was recorded in the first few years 
of the new millennium.
The trend of rising capital flows was inter -
rupted by the global financial crisis. Following 
the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 
2008, there was initially a massive slump in 
global gross capital inflows. Although these Growing capital

1 “Gross capital inflows” refer to the purchases less sales of 
domestic assets by non- residents within a specific period. 
Accordingly, “gross capital outflows” are the purchases less 
sales of foreign assets by residents. “Net capital inflows” 
are the difference between gross capital inflows and gross 
capital outflows. See Committee on the Global Financial 
System (2009). Net capital flows can be interpreted as the 
financial counterpart to the current account balance and 
thus provide an opportunity for approximating the impact 
of non- resident investors on the domestic economy. See 
Borio and Disyatat (2015).

3 Here and in the rest of this article, the focus is on the 
countries belonging to the Group of 20 (G20). The Euro -
pean Union, which is also a G20 member, is disregarded. 
The G20 emerging market economies comprise Argentina, 
Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Ara -
bia, South Africa and Turkey. The advanced economies in

subsequently recovered, they have grown 
much more slowly than they had before the 
global financial crisis. Over time, a growing 
proportion of gross capital inflows have been 
attributable to the emerging market econ -
omies.4 Against the backdrop of adjustments 
to the financial system in the wake of the 
global financial crisis, the rising attractiveness 
of the emerging market economies to investors 
led to comparatively robust capital inflows, 
while the inflows to and outflows from the ad -
vanced economies declined.5
In addition to their volumes, the composition 
of capital flows also changed significantly in 
the aftermath of the global financial crisis (see 
the chart on p. 56). For example, their structure 
reveals a decline in cross- border loans, espe -
cially from banks.6 This applies mainly to ad -
vanced economies, but also, to a lesser extent, 
to some of the G20 emerging market econ -
omies.7 In several emerging market economies, 
the withdrawal of foreign banks was offset by 
increasing significance of the bond market. 
Bank loans and portfolio investment now fund 
emerging market economies in roughly equal 
measure.
The extent to which the COVID-  19 pandemic 
has changed global capital flows cannot be 
precisely assessed at present due to the lagged availability of balance of payments data. Never -
theless, in March this year, the inflows to in -
vestment funds that invest in equity and bond 
funds in G20 emerging market economies fell 
by an unprecedented amount. These capital 
flows are generally considered to be a good 
approximation of portfolio investment.8 In the 
second quarter of 2020, strong outflows from 
equity funds continued to be observed, while 
inflows to bond funds stabilised somewhat. 
Compared with other crisis episodes that were 
characterised by high outflows of funds from 
emerging market economies, not only the vol -
ume, but also the rapid speed of the outflows 
from the emerging market economies over the 
past few months was especially noteworthy 
(see the chart on p. 57).9

itionally categorised into “pull” and “push” fac -
tors. Pull factors comprise influencing factors 
that originate from the recipient country and 
affect investors, while push factors are the 
causes that prevail in the capital- exporting 
country.10 In addition, more recent approaches 
examine what are known as “pipes”, which 
reflect  structural factors in the international 
monetary system.11
These factors may exert a stronger or weaker 
influence depending on the country and situ -
ation. Portfolio investment, like other invest -
ment, appears to be based more on short- term 
considerations. It exhibits a significantly nega -
tive correlation with the level of risk aversion 
and interest rates in the capital- exporting coun -
try. However, it appears to be increasingly influ -
enced by the prevailing domestic fundamentals 
and the local risk situation in the recipient 
country. This suggests that investors are differ -
entiating more clearly between individual 
emerging market economies.12While domestic factors, such as growth differ -
entials, can exert a considerable influence on 
the volume of capital flows in the recipient 
country, global factors, such as risk aversion or 
the US monetary policy stance, appear to have 
a larger impact than domestic factors on the 
volatility of capital flows in emerging market 
economies.13

nomic terms, shocks – i.e. unexpected events – 
in one country can also have an impact on 
other countries, which can in turn have feed -
back effects on the country in which the shock 
originated; in the literature, these effects are 
known, respectively, as “spillover” and “spill -
back”. To an increasing degree, this also ap -
plies to the relationships between advanced 
economies and emerging market economies.
The spillover of shocks can occur through dir -
ect and indirect trade channels as well as 
through direct and indirect financial channels. 
Direct financial linkages are the result of the 
cross- border claims and liabilities of banks, 
other financial institutions, governments, en -
terprises and households, which can invest or 
obtain funding abroad via loans, direct invest -
ment or portfolio investment. Indirect financial 
linkages can, for example, arise due to connec -
tions via third parties, such as common invest -
ors. The wide range of cross- border intercon -
nectivities and dependencies within the global 
financial system and the real economy are ul -
timately responsible for the spillover effects be -
tween countries and regions. Spillovers can 
occur through a variety of transmission chan -
nels. In this article, spillover effects are meas -
ured without focusing on the channels through 
which the shock is transmitted. The aim of this 
analysis is to map the development and 
changes in the spillover effects over time. This 
allows for an assessment of whether, in the 
light of the growing significance of the emer -
ging market economies, the mutual depend -
ence between the advanced economies and 
the emerging market economies has changed 
permanently or in specific phases over recent 
years.
In recent years, the empirical literature has in -
creasingly been exploring the issue of cross-  
border spillover effects. While empirical ana -
lyses used to look, in particular, at real eco -
nomic transmission channels such as trade or 
commodity markets, increasing financial glob -
alisation has lately brought a greater focus on 
analysing financial spillover effects.14There are two major strands to the literature on 
this topic. The first comprises network models 
aimed at investigating the causal mechanisms 
of financial contagion. Such analyses are based 
on balance sheet and macroeconomic funda -
mentals. Network models gained in import -
ance following the Asian financial crisis of 
1997-98 and the global financial crisis of 
2007-08, with the work of Allen and Gale 
(2000) as well as Forbes and Rigobon (2002) 
representing seminal contributions.15
The second strand of the literature is concerned 
with econometric models that use market data 
to identify spillover effects without making any 
further assumptions about the dynamics of 
shock transmission.16 For example, the ap -Spillover effects

Monthly Report, centres on a simple and widely 
applicable quantitative measure for spillovers 
and their evolution over time, revealing trends, 
cycles and breaks.17 This method does not 
focus on how shocks are transmitted, but 
rather  provides a measure for estimating the 
intensity  of spillover effects. The methodology 
can thus be applied to measure the strength of 
spillovers between the G20 countries.
At the same time, the approach offers a way 
of  assessing spillover effects in the current 
COVID-  19 pandemic (see p. 62).
The outbreak of the pandemic saw share prices 
tumble heavily across all G20 countries – in -
cluding countries where case numbers had 
hitherto not been quite as high as elsewhere. 
In the first half of 2020, the German stock mar -
ket index DAX and the Euro Stoxx 50 dropped 
by more than 35% at the peak of the slump 
and the US stock market index S&P 500 fell by 
more than 30% compared with the end of 
2019. Stock market price data are available at 
high frequency and respond quickly to news, 
so the spillover index described earlier is calcu -
lated for the yields of G20 benchmark stock in -
dices (see the box on pp. 59 ff.). These are daily 
price data in local currency for the period from 
January 1999 to August 2020. In order to con -
trol for the different time zones, the yield on 
each individual stock index is calculated from 
Friday to Friday. A spillover index value of 100 
indicates that the total variance of a variable is 
attributable to spillovers of shocks in other vari -
ables. A value of zero, on the other hand, sig -
nals an absence of discernible spillovers.
A country transmits more spillovers than it re -
ceives when the difference between its index 
of spillovers to other countries and its index of 
spillovers from other countries is greater than 
zero. In the literature, this is also referred to as 
the net spillover index.18 The analysis suggests 
that certain countries tend to act more as a 
sender rather than as a recipient of spillovers: Germany, with a net spillover index of 32, 
sends on average more spillovers to other G20 
countries, while Turkey (-26) and Argentina 
(-17), for example, are on the receiving end of 
spillovers from the other G20 countries. As is to 
be expected, spillovers between countries be -
longing to the same region, for example in Eur -
ope between Germany and Italy (11 from Ger -
many to Italy and 9 in the other direction) or 
between Mexico and Brazil in Latin America 
(8 from Mexico to Brazil and 7 vice versa) are 
typically larger than those between two coun -
tries from different regions, such as between 
Germany and Brazil (from Germany to Brazil 6, 
4 vice versa). At 62.5, the spillover index meas -
uring the average spillovers between the coun -
tries of the G20 indicates that a large propor -
tion of the variance of all variables is attribut -
able to spillover effects from other variables.
Since the focus is on looking at the countries as 
groups, the next step is to analyse the average 
spillovers between the emerging market econ -
omies and the advanced economies. A simul -
taneous shock in all G20 emerging market 
economies or all G20 advanced economies is 
assumed (for more, see the bottom of the box 
on p. 62). It is apparent at aggregated level, 
too, that spillovers within the two country 
groupings are larger than spillovers from emer -
ging market economies to advanced econ -
omies and vice versa. Moreover, averaged over 
the complete analysis period from January 
1999 to June 2020, advanced economies trans -
mitted more spillovers to emerging market 
economies than they received from them, with 
the spillover index reaching 42. However, at 29, 
the spillover index from emerging market econ -
omies is not negligible.
Repeating the analysis for rolling windows of 
100 weeks each (i.e. roughly two years) makes 
it possible to represent the spillover matrix for 
all G20 countries and the group spillover matrix 
in chart form. The value of the spillover index Estimating spill -

The Diebold and Yılmaz spillover index
Unlike other methods based on macroeco-
nomic or balance sheet data, which are 
usually published only a few times per year, 
the Diebold and Yılmaz (2009, 2012, 2015) 
approach to estimating spillover effects 
uses daily market data. This enables their 
approach to produce a high- frequency 
measure of spillover effects that adapts 
more quickly than other indicators to 
changes in the data,1 lending this spillover 
measure some of the greatest predictive 
power amongst existing indicators.2
Since the Diebold and Yılmaz spillover index 
also requires only minimal assumptions, this 
methodology is employed in a wide variety 
of papers. It can be applied to price- based 
analyses as well as to quantitative variables 
and can also be used to model potential 
transmission channels. In this box, the ap-
proach will be used to estimate fi  nancial 
spillovers based on equity market returns of 
the benchmark indices of G20 countries.
The spillover index is based on a rolling esti-
mate of VAR models in which the variances 
of the forecast errors are decomposed. On 
this basis, a time- varying index is then con-
structed.
The estimate for a single time window then 
follows the reduced- form VAR(p) model:
yt=pX
h=1hyth+"t
 ,
where yt is a vector with observations of all 
N endogenous variables. In the present 
case, these are the daily returns of the bench-
mark indices3 of the G20 countries.4 Φ rep-
resents an N ×N matrix with regression co-
effi   cients that refer to the observations of 
the endogenous variable (yt-h) lagged by p units of time. εt denotes the error term not 
explained by the model, where (εt)t ≥0~iid(0,/summation.text) 
and E [εt,ε/prime
t /prime] = 0 /universal.st t ≠ t /prime. In the analysis 
of G20 benchmark equity index5 returns, an 
autoregressive lag of p = 2 is selected.6
The VAR(p ) is then transformed into a 
“moving average”:7
yt=1X
h=0Ah"t−h
 .
1 See Diebold and Yılmaz (2009). Diebold and Yılmaz 
argue that, with increasing data frequency, an empir-
ical model is better able to correctly track the time 
variation  of spillover effects. In addition, for certain 
countries – including some of the G20 emerging mar-
ket economies – it is diffi   cult to obtain reliable data on 
the macroeconomic fundamentals and the balance 
sheets of general government, fi  nancial institutions 
and enterprises.
2 See Arsov et al. (2013). Moreover, the spillover meas-
ure is closely related to other known systemic meas-
ures of risk such as the CoVaR, introduced by Adrian 
and Brunnermeier (2016), and the Marginal Expected 
Shortfall, published in Acharya et al. (2016).
3 Here and in the rest of this box, the focus is on the 
countries belonging to the Group of 20 (G20). The 
European Union, which is also a G20 member, is disre-
garded. In this box, the G20 emerging market econ-
omies comprise Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indo-
nesia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and 
Turkey, and the advanced economies in the G20 are 
Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South 
Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States.
4 The VIX is additionally used in the estimate in order 
to control for global risk aversion, which could be a 
powerful driver of data patterns. The VIX serves here 
as a sort of “quasi- exogenous” variable that is omitted 
when calculating the spillover indices. The analysis is 
also rerun as a VARX model with the VIX as an exogen-
ous variable, which leads to similar results.
5 The benchmark equity indices used here are MERVAL, 
S&P/ ASX 200, Bovespa, S&P/ TSX, Shanghai SSE, DAX, 
CAC 40, FTSE 100, IDX Composite, Nifty50, FSTE MIB, 
Nikkei 225, KOSPI, S&P/ BMV IPC, MOEX, Tadawul All 
Share, S&P 500 and JSE, and they are called up via 
Bloomberg. The vast majority of these are price in-
dices. Only the DAX and Bovespa are performance in-
dices. The selected benchmark indices are used in this 
fashion in other research papers, too.
6 Based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), 
p = 2 is selected.

Here, the N ×N coeffi   cient matrix Ah fol-
lows the recursion Ah = Φ1Ah–1 + Φ2Ah–2 
+ … + ΦpAh-p where A0 represents an 
(N ×N ) identity matrix. In addition, Ah = 0 
if h < 0. Accordingly, in the “moving aver-
age” representation, the current value of a 
variable is defi  ned via a function of its cur-
rent and past error terms.
In the next step, impulse response functions 
are created in order to estimate the time 
profi  le of a shock δ which hits the system at 
time t up to time t + H given the absence 
of any other shocks to the system. The fore-
casting horizon H = 10  is chosen here.8 In-
stead of the Cholesky decomposition, the 
generalised VAR framework of Koop, Pesa-
ran and Potter (1996) and Pesaran and Shin 
(1998) is used. The advantage of the gener-
alised framework is that no assumptions re-
garding the causal relationships between 
the disturbance terms are necessary. How-
ever, the downside is that contemporan-
eous causal effects cannot be modelled.9 
Instead of shocking all elements of εt, only 
the j th element in εt is shocked, and the 
impacts of other shocks are disregarded as-
suming multivariate normal distribution of 
εt. The shock δj in the variable εj,t of one 
standard deviation 1

jj at time t  creates a 
generalised impulse response function 
(GIRF) of:

E[yt+h |!t1]

jj the standard deviation of the error 
term of the j th equation, Ah the coeffi   cient 
matrix, /summation.text the covariance matrix of the 
error term εt and ej a selection vector of di-
mension (N ×1) where the j th element 
takes a value of one and all other elements 
take a value of zero. ω(t–1) comprises all in-
formation known up until time ( t–1). The GIRFs model the dependent variables’ re-
sponses to shocks to each variable in the 
system. A shock with a magnitude of one 
standard deviation to each error term is 
simulated separately on each equation, pro-
ducing a total of N 2 GIRFs.
In the next step, the impulse response 
functions  are used to calculate the fore-
cast  error variance ( FEV ) for each vari-
able. It  gives the dispersion of each vari-
able  which, owing to the shock that 
occurred  in  εt , would have been impossible 
to forecast  between t  and t  + H. For 
the  variable  yi the FEV is given as 
FEV (yi,t+H |!t)=PH−1
h=0e0
jAhPA0
hej. A 
shock to the variable j directly impacts the 
variable itself but, due to the dynamic struc-
ture of the VAR model, can also affect all 
other variables in the system. The contribu-
tions by each of the individual shocks to the 
FEVs of the respective variables can be cal-
culated using a forecast error variance de-
composition (FEVD). The FEV of variable 
i (H steps ahead) explained by a shock in 
the equation of variable j is calculated as:
⇥ij(H)=−1

The results for all i  variables and j  shocks 
can be represented in an N ×N matrix 
where the element Θij represents the share 
in the FEV of variable i  explained by a 
8 The ten- step- ahead forecasting horizon is a standard 
assumption in the literature. See Diebold and Yılmaz 
(2009).
9 Alternative approaches generally require additional 
assumptions. Although a Cholesky decomposition 
leads to orthogonal shocks and thus allows for un-
equivocal identifi  cation, it also requires additional as-
sumptions concerning the contemporaneous causal 
relationships between the variables. The approach pro-
posed by Bettendorf and Heinlein (2019) presented in 
the July 2019 issue of the Bundesbank’s Monthly Re-
port (see Deutsche Bundesbank (2019)) likewise pre-
sumes the existence of a clear causal structure be-
tween the error terms.Deutsche Bundesbank

shock to variable j.10 Element ΘAR,DE, for in-
stance, would be the share in the FEV of 
the return of Argentina’s equity price index 
attributable to shocks in the model equa-
tion for the return of the German DAX. 
Since, in the generalised framework, shocks 
in each variable are not necessarily orthog-
onal, the shares in the FEV of a variable 
explained by shocks do not necessarily add 
up to 100%. Accordingly, each element of 
the FEVD matrix is normalised with the re-
spective row total, i.e. e⇥ij=⇥ijPN
j=1⇥ij, 
which means that PN
j=1e⇥ij = 1 and 
PN
i,j=1e⇥ij = N. The FEV of each variable 
in the system is thus equally weighted, 
which means that the rows of the normal-
ised matrix can be compared with one an-
other. This enables the variance shares in 
both the rows and the columns of the nor-
malised matrix to be added up and com-
pared for different variables.
Off- diagonal entries in the normalised 
FEVD matrix (~Θij where i ≠ j) are used as 
a measure of spillover effects between the 
variables in the system. In order to obtain a 
spillover index SI for the estimated period, 
the total of all off- diagonal entries is divided 
by the total of all entries in the matrix:
SI=PN
i,j=1,i6=je⇥ijPN
i,j=1e⇥ij=PN
i,j=1,i6=je⇥ij
N.This measure can also be used to measure 
directional spillovers from variable j to all 
other variables i = 1,/uni00A0…, N:
e⇥⌅ j=PN
i=1,i6=je⇥i j
N,
and, by analogy, directional spillovers to 
variable i from all variables j = 1,/uni00A0…, N :
e⇥i ⌅=PN
j=1,i6=je⇥i j
N.
For each variable in the system, the direc-
tional “from” and “to” spillover indices can 
be used to calculate a net spillover index 
that shows whether a variable is more likely 
to be the source or recipient of spillover ef-
fects. The normalised FEVD matrix, the 
directional spillover indices, the net spillover 
index and the total spillover index are pre-
sented in a spillover matrix (see the table 
above).

and intensity of spillovers between ad-

the sense that spillover effects are only propagated 
from one given country to another country – can be 
modelled only using lagged variables. The results

ised and spilled over at the same time (see Bettendorf 
and Heinlein (2019)).Spillover matrix

The group spillover index between emerging 
market economies and advanced economies (black line) is lower than that between all G20 
countries (grey dashed line). This is because the 
latter also reflects spillovers between advanced 
economies amongst themselves and emerging 
market economies amongst themselves, and 
these tend to be relatively high. For the pur -
poses of the grouped perspective, these are, 
however, included in the respective own share 
for the grouping – i.e. the diagonal entries in 
the group spillover matrix.

spillover (the non- diagonal entries) from emer -

creased especially when financial markets have 
experienced phases of heightened stress, such 
as the bursting of the dotcom bubble in 2000, 
the global financial crisis and the onset of the 
COVID-  19 pandemic. These final two events 
represent the strongest and, above all, most 
rapid rise in spillovers in the period covered by 
the analysis. That the COVID-  19 pandemic is so 
clearly reflected in the estimation results is strik -
ing. Having said that, compared with other cri -
sis periods, this pandemic has hit all countries 
hard and, most importantly, unexpectedly. It 
remains to be seen how spillover effects will 
evolve over time and whether a prolonged 
period of high spillovers will set in, as it did in 
the wake of the global financial crisis.
Vulnerabilities in emerging 
market economies
The rise in international capital flows and the 
rapidity with which capital markets respond have fundamentally changed the conditions 
for national economic policy in open econ -
omies.
In particular, as shown above, countries are vul -
nerable to shocks or spillovers emanating from 
other countries. In the past, crises in one coun -
try have already been known to spread to other 
emerging market economies or induce wake-  
up calls for investors.20 With emerging market 
economies now more deeply integrated into 
the global financial system, this could also in -
creasingly entail spillbacks to advanced econ -
omies.
It is also conceivable that, where investors har -
bour mistrust towards a country with high 
levels of debt and pursuing economic policies 
that do not inspire confidence, such sentiments 
may spread to other countries with similar 
issues, be they an emerging market economy Crises in individual

A heatmap for the external stability of selected emerging 
market economies
Similarly to international institutions, the 
Bundesbank calculates and assesses a var-
iety of metrics that shed light on the exter-
nal stability of selected emerging market 
economies (EMEs).1 These include a metric 
for assessing a country’s foreign currency 
reserve adequacy (ARA), exchange market 
pressure (EMP), and infl  ows from invest-
ment funds that invest in EMEs. Warning 
signals can be derived from these indicators 
in the event that certain thresholds are ex-
ceeded or undershot. By colour- coding the 
number of such warning signals for each 
country and each point in time, they can be 
presented visually in the form of a heatmap.
The three selected indicators and the defi  n-
ition of the warning signals are described in 
more detail below.
The ARA indicator shows whether a country 
has suffi   cient reserves to compensate for an 
outfl  ow of foreign currency in the event of 
a temporary crisis. The magnitude of poten-
tial outfl  ows is determined on the basis of 
historical experience (i.e. from past balance 
of payments crises) and current macroeco-
nomic conditions. If the existing foreign 
currency reserves are lower than the thresh-
old value derived from them, a warning sig-
nal is emitted in the corresponding quarter. 
The indicator was originally developed by 
the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The 
Bundesbank uses a slightly modifi  ed ver-
sion.2
The EMP indicator measures the exchange 
market pressure affecting a country’s cur-
rency (i) at time t. Various options for esti-
mating the EMP indicator are discussed in 
the literature.3 The indicator used here is 
derived from the unweighted average of 
the bilateral rate of change in the exchange rate against the US dollar (∆% S),4 the per-
centage change in foreign reserves (∆% R) 
and the difference in short- term domestic 
interest rates relative to the short- term 
interest rate level of the United States 
(∆ I):5
EMP i,t=1
3(I i,t%S i,t%R i,t).
A warning signal is triggered when the 
value of the EMP indicator exceeds its long- 
term, country- specifi  c average by 1.5 times 
the standard deviation of the index.6
Overall, the EMP indicator is less persistent 
than the ARA indicator. Warning signals 
thus only appear for relatively short periods 
of time in the EMP indicator. One reason for 
this is that in contrast to the ARA indicator, 
the EMP indicator is not based on levels, 
but rather on rates of change (within a 
quarter). The latter generally revert quickly 
to their average values. The variables exam-
1 The EMEs are a selection of those represented in the 
G20 (Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mex-
ico, Russia, South Africa and Turkey). In addition to 
this, the Bundesbank also studies individual countries 
that are currently subject to especial external exposure 
on account of particular events or that are in the spot-
light for any other reason on an ad hoc basis.
2 See IMF (2011, 2015) and Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2017).
3 See Hossfeld and Pramor (2018).
4 Indirect quotation: an increase in the exchange rate 
represents an appreciation of the respective domestic 
currency.
5 The indicator based on the unweighted average has 
proven to be a particularly robust measure in empirical 
studies.
6 The EMP indices are adjusted for statistical outliers 
when calculating the standard deviation. Without such 
adjustment, particularly severe crises would distort the 
standard deviation upwards to such an extent that 
smaller crises would no longer be identifi  ed. An outlier 
is defi  ned as an absolute value that exceeds the 
country- specifi  c absolute minimum of the EMP index 
by 100. This threshold value was chosen so that 
known crisis periods from the past could be identifi  ed 
as successfully as possible.Deutsche Bundesbank

ined by the EMP indicator would thus have 
to experience above- average change over a 
relatively long period of time to trigger a 
signal lasting over several quarters. By con-
trast, if holdings of foreign currency re-
serves fall under the threshold value and 
remain there, this is enough to trigger a 
persistent signal in the ARA indicator.
The infl  ows from investment funds that in-
vest in a specifi  c country serve as a timely 
indicator for the gross capital fl  ows into 
that country.7 A warning signal is triggered 
as soon as the sum of investment in debt 
securities and equity instruments demon-
strates that international investors have 
withdrawn funds from a country over one 
quarter. In this context, it is rather unusual 
for the countries under observation to dis-
play an outfl  ow of funds exceeding a period 
of three months. The threshold value is 
therefore selected  to ensure that even mar-
ginal outfl  ows trigger a warning signal. This 
indicator correlates strongly across the indi-
vidual EMEs, suggesting that investors tend 
to make their investment decisions for sev-
eral EMEs at the same time. That said, 
country- specifi  c factors, which may even 
occasionally outweigh cross- border infl  u-
ences, also play a role.
Each of the three indicators can be studied 
individually in order to identify tensions in a 
specifi  c area of international capital fl  ows. 
However, severe tensions often appear in 
several different indicators at the same 
time, as the individual indicators are not in-
dependent of each other. If, for example, 
international investors shift their focus away 
from a particular investment location, the 
effect of this is unlikely to be restricted to 
capital outfl  ows. The currency of the af-
fected country may also come under pres-
sure, resulting in a persistent outfl  ow of for-
eign reserves if the central bank attempts to 
bolster the national currency. This may ul-timately mean that the critical mass of for-
eign reserves is undershot.
The three indicators can be summarised in a 
heatmap, which paints a clear yet nuanced 
picture of a country’s external vulnerability. 
The total number of warning signals from 
the various indicators is added up for each 
point in time and each country. The corres-
ponding sum is then colour- coded to pro-
vide a general overview. For instance, a 
country’s cell is shaded light grey if no 
warning signal appears at the correspond-
ing point in time across all indicators. If 
there is a single warning signal, the cell is 
shaded light blue. If there are two or three 
warning signals, the cell is shaded medium 
blue or dark blue respectively. A dark blue 
signal is thus interpreted to mean that, at 
the point in question, a country’s foreign 
currency reserves are too low, it is subject 
to exchange rate pressure and, at the same 
7 The data are based on the monthly reports of EPFR 
Global. These reports depict the infl  ows from invest-
ment funds that submit information to EPFR Global. 
The values can therefore only be taken as an approxi-
mation of the offi   cial balance of payments data. As the 
offi   cial data are generally only published after a signifi  -
cant delay, developments in international capital fl  ows 
can be assessed considerably sooner with the data 
used here.Heatmap for warning signals regarding

time, international investors are withdraw-
ing funds from that country.
The heatmap (see the chart on p. 65) shows 
the results for the EMEs of the G20. The 
period under review runs from the fi  rst 
quarter of 2017 to the fi  rst quarter of 2020.
The chart clearly illustrates the increase in 
external vulnerability associated with the 
COVID- 19 pandemic in the fi  rst quarter of 
2020. On account of the pandemic- related 
uncertainty regarding future global eco-
nomic developments, investors appear to 
have withdrawn capital from EMEs to a 
greater extent. This resulted in the relevant 
indicator showing a warning signal for all 
countries under observation during the fi  rst 
three months of 2020, and also explains 
why there is at least a light blue signal on 
the heatmap for each country.
As the estimated ARA indicator in the fi  rst 
quarter of 2020 also confi  rms an insuffi   -
cient stock of foreign currency reserves in 
the case of Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Tur-
key and South Africa, these countries dis-
play at least a medium blue signal.
The heatmap even shows dark blue signals 
for two of the countries under observation. 
This can be attributed to the fact that 
heightened exchange market pressure 
could be observed for Argentina and Brazil 
in addition to the aforementioned warning 
signals.
A heatmap can be used to depict key devel-
opments and relationships in a timely and 
concise manner. Even so, it should always 
be embedded into a more comprehensive 
analysis rather than serving as a replace-
ment for this; in spite of the extensive ana-
lyses behind the individual indicators, exter-
nal sector developments are ultimately pre-
sented in a highly simplifi  ed manner. This refl  ects the fact that the warning signals 
and indicators are, in part, based on strong 
assumptions and are subject to estimation 
uncertainty. For example, a stable relation-
ship between the observable variables dur-
ing past and possible current crises is as-
sumed. Even summarising the indicators by 
giving all warning signals the same weight-
ing represents a considerable simplifi  cation. 
Ultimately, the three indicators under con-
sideration deliver only a limited overview of 
the developments in international capital 
movements. Nevertheless, the results pro-
vide key indications as to which countries’ 
capital fl  ows merit closer analysis with re-
gard to external stability.Deutsche Bundesbank

or an advanced economy. The magnitude of 
the distortions experienced in the countries is 
therefore contingent not only on the external 
impulse but also on the domestic vulnerabilities 
of the countries.
The box on pp. 64 ff. takes a closer look at the 
external vulnerability of emerging market econ -
omies belonging to the G20. Analysing past 
finan cial market and balance of payments cri -
ses reveals that exchange market pressure on 
the domestic currency, foreign currency reserve 
holdings and the behaviour of international in -
vestors are key factors. Critical values are deter -
mined for these three indicators; whenever they 
exceed or fall below these markers, a warning 
signal is triggered. The investigation shows that 
the external stability of certain countries deteri -
orated sharply during the COVID-  19 pandemic. 
This is particularly true of Argentina and Brazil, 
which breached the predefined thresholds for 
all three criteria. This does not necessarily mean 
that the other countries are less at risk of exter -
nal imbalance, however. Examining the selected 
indicators and the warning signals triggered 
can only furnish initial reference points for a 
more in- depth analysis. This is partly because it 
is not possible to take all potential threats into 
account. Furthermore, the threshold values in 
question were calculated on the basis of histor -
ical crisis patterns and with transmission mech -
anisms assumed to hold constant. These may 
change over time, however.
Economic policy options for 
utilising the benefits of 
cross- border capital flows
Capital flows to emerging market economies 
have, in recent decades, been highly volatile: 
periods of strong inflows have been followed 
by times where inflows have suddenly dried up 
or where there have even been massive out -
flows. The forces driving these phenomena 
may lie in the emerging market economies 
themselves, but may also be the product of 
global trends.By implementing appropriate policy measures, 
emerging market economies can help ensure 
that capital inflows do not have a destabilising 
effect and instead bring sustainable economic 
benefits. Well-  developed and regulated finan -
cial systems and, above all, sound macroeco -
nomic policies can bolster resilience; they can 
help to prevent crises and to give economic 
policymakers room for manoeuvre when chal -
lenging economic conditions arise.
A potential starting point in terms of expanding 
this scope for economic policy action lies in de -
veloping local capital markets. This would im -
prove access to borrowing in local currency, 
and therefore reduce financing needs in for -
eign currency for a given debt level, which is 
considered one of the major reasons behind 
heightened financial system vulnerability. This 
has prompted many emerging market econ -
omies to push forward with the development 
of local capital markets in recent years.21 Al-
most everywhere, this has been accompanied 
by a significant increase in the proportion of 
local currency debt, which shifts the exchange 
rate risk for that portion of debt to foreign 
creditors. While issuance in local currency has 
become established practice for government 
securities, corporate debt continues to be pre -
dominantly denominated in foreign currency. 
Moreover, events in spring 2020 showed that 
markets for debt instruments denominated in 
domestic currency are also exposed to height -
ened volatility not least due to international in -
vestors selling off debt instruments issued by 
emerging market economies.22 Since foreign 
investors’ investment motives need not be 
geared only to local circumstances but also to 
regional developments or to the behaviour of 
other investors, building up a sufficiently large 
base of domestic investors might be helpful  in Vulnerabilities in

21 This has also been accompanied by a significant in -
crease in debt, however. According to the BIS, public debt 
on the capital market rose across a broad base of emerging 
market economies from 18% of gross domestic product in 
2000 to 37% in 2017. See Wooldridge (2020).
22 This appears to be due to the presence of a small num -
ber of large investment funds in these countries and a ten -
dency toward herd behaviour. See Wooldridge (2020).Deutsche Bundesbank

limiting volatility from this source. However, 
emerging market economies often still lack the 
supporting infrastructure, such as liquid  deriva -
tives markets, which facilitate local trading.
When capital flows exhibit a high degree of 
volatility, flexible exchange rates can, in prin -
ciple, absorb some of the external shocks. 
Monetary policy can also respond, with the 
classic instruments being interest rate adjust -
ment or interventions in the foreign exchange 
market. Recent IMF analyses suggest that, con -
trary to previous assumptions, the transmission 
of interest rate policy decisions in emerging 
market economies which have adopted infla -
tion targeting can be as effective as in ad -
vanced economies.23
Sufficiently large foreign exchange reserves can 
increase the options available to emerging mar -
ket economies. First, foreign exchange reserves 
built up in good times have an important posi -
tive signalling function, meaning that, in a 
best- case scenario, the mere existence of high 
reserves can prevent investors from losing con -
fidence and a crisis from breaking out. Second, 
solid reserve buffers can be used to temporarily 
offset capital outflows in the event of a crisis 
and thus limit excessive exchange rate fluctu -
ations. However, interventions of this type 
should only function as an adjustment mech -
anism during periods of heightened volatility in 
capital flows. They should not be used to re -
place necessary economic policy corrections or 
prevent fundamentally necessary adjustments 
to the (real) exchange rate in the long term.
Given the current economic turmoil, it is diffi -
cult to unequivocally assess the intervention 
behaviour of most countries as these data are 
often confidential. According to the IMF, indi -
vidual countries such as Brazil, Russia, Turkey 
and Indonesia have intervened in the foreign 
exchange market on a number of occasions 
since February 2020 or, like India, have carried 
out foreign exchange swaps.24In addition to the instruments mentioned 
above, countries may also implement measures 
to influence capital flows more directly. This 
category covers macroprudential policies but 
also capital controls. Since the financial crisis, 
macroprudential measures have increasingly 
been employed as an economic policy tool and 
are mostly used to influence credit growth and 
financial institutions’ leverage by curbing or fa -
cilitating the inflow of capital. They are often 
used as preventative measures to stop imbal -
ances from emerging in the financial system, 
and typically tend to be long- term. Despite 
their growing use, however, there has so far 
been little empirical evidence on the extent to 
which macroprudential measures are able to 
reduce spillover effects.25 The easing of macro -
prudential measures is one of the most fre -
quently used economic policy responses to the 
COVID-  19 crisis alongside fiscal and monetary 
policy responses. Almost every country made 
use of them in one form or another with the 
primary objective of facilitating access to liquid -
ity across the individual G20 member states.26
Macroprudential measures may also take the 
form of capital controls when they affect cap -
ital flows. Academic literature and international 
organisations are largely critical of such meas -
ures due to their distortionary effects on capital 
allocation. However, those taken as part of a 
longer- term strategy to liberalise capital move -
ments are largely undisputed. They should be 
used to prevent imbalances from building up as 
long as the financial systems in question remain 
relatively underdeveloped.
As experience of the global financial crisis has 
shown, capital controls are increasingly being 
seen as a potential means of safeguarding 
finan cial stability. For example, they could be 
used to change the composition of capital Foreign

flows in favour of capital flows with low volatil -
ity. In the case of critical capital outflows, cap -
ital controls could also be regarded as a legit -
imate policy instrument under certain condi -
tions. This thinking is outlined in the Institu -
tional View,27 authored by the IMF in 2012, 
which considers the deployment of capital con -
trols as a possible policy option depending on 
country- specific considerations. Owing to the 
side effects associated with this instrument, for 
instance with regard to circumventions, meas -
ures regulating capital movements should be 
transparent and temporary. As soon as the crit -
ical situation is over, these controls should be 
lifted. Under no circumstances should they be 
used to delay necessary macroeconomic ad -
justments. According to the IMF, no G20 coun -
try has yet introduced additional capital con -
trols in the context of the current COVID-  19 
pandemic.
The grave global consequences of the COVID- 
19 pandemic have once again made it clear 
that the associated challenges at the national 
level may be beyond the financial capacities of 
less developed countries in particular. These 
require  supplementary international policy 
approaches , policy advice and financial sup -
port. The latter can be provided through official 
finan cial assistance from countries and organ -
isations, the IMF, multilateral and regional de -
velopment banks and/ or regional institutions 
(Regional Financing Arrangements). In add -
ition, the central banks of reserve currency 
countries may, within their mandate, grant 
swap lines or repo facilities to other central 
banks in order to safeguard the liquidity of the 
money market in foreign currency.28
Owing to its global membership, its mandate 
and its expertise, the IMF plays a prominent 
role in helping to combat balance of payments 
problems. With permanent resources of around 
€570 billion, funds from credit lines worth 
around €600 billion for crisis situations and 
additional trust funds for financial assistance to 
low- income countries, it has ample financial 
resources  to support members when needed.During the COVID-  19 pandemic, the IMF has 
already provided financial support to over 85 
member countries and has taken a number of 
measures to assist members more effectively. 
For example, the access limits for emergency 
credit (Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) and Rapid 
Finan cing Instrument (RFI)) and the annual 
access  limits for financial assistance were tem -
porarily increased. In addition, the priorities of 
the IMF work programme and internal pro -
cesses have been revised in order to enable the 
Fund to respond more quickly to members’ re -
quests for assistance. In addition, a new tem -
porary short- term liquidity line was set up for 
members with very strong economic funda -
mentals in order to cushion moderate balance 
of payments needs arising due to tension in the 
international capital markets.
Conclusion
The global interconnectedness of national 
finan cial systems has continued to increase 
over the past two decades, although this trend 
has lessened somewhat since the global finan -
cial crisis. It is not possible at this stage to con -
clusively assess how the COVID-  19 pandemic 
will affect this trend. Given the high level of 
global economic integration achieved, emer -
ging market economies and, increasingly, ad -
vanced economies are vulnerable to external 
shocks. Global capital flows are a key transmis -
sion channel, and their volatility can present a 
challenge, especially to countries with less de -
veloped financial systems. The current COVID-  
19 pandemic has shown once again that, dur -International

rangement between the Federal Reserve, the ECB, the Bank 
of Japan, the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada and the 
Swiss National Bank. Following the outbreak of the COVID- 
19 pandemic, the ECB additionally agreed on temporary 
and limited swap lines with Bulgaria, Croatia and Denmark. 
The US Federal Reserve set up similar swap lines with Aus -
tralia, Brazil, Denmark, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, 
Singapore, South Korea and Sweden. Both the Federal Re -
serve and the ECB have also established securities repur -

ing periods of stress, a flight to safe invest -
ments, domestic assets and cash can exacer -
bate tensions for emerging market economies. 
However, the analysis also shows that, as finan -
cial spillovers to and spillbacks from emerging 
market economies increase, domestic eco -
nomic policy in advanced economies may also 
be exposed to potentially destabilising influ -
ences.
The G20 countries present a mixed picture in 
this respect: some countries tend to transmit 
spillover effects on balance, whilst others 
mainly receive them. The effects within country 
groups are more pronounced than between 
advanced and emerging market economies, 
although  the advanced economies are still 
respon sible for stronger spillovers to the emer -
ging market economies than vice versa. Worth 
noting is the stark rise in transmission effects at 
the onset of the COVID-  19 pandemic, which exceeded the level of the global financial crisis 
at an early stage.
The extent of the vulnerabilities is not deter -
mined solely by the spillover effects, but also 
needs to be assessed together with local condi -
tions in the individual countries. This shows 
that the potential vulnerabilities of individual 
G20 members have increased markedly in the 
current crisis. The extent to which these vulner -
abilities will materialise is partly determined by 
each country’s economic policy. The develop -
ment of local capital markets and a sufficient 
stock of foreign exchange reserves are useful 
components of a stability- oriented macroeco -
nomic policy. From a financial stability perspec -
tive, it may make sense to deploy macropru -
dential measures as well as – under certain cir -
cumstances – measures designed to manage 
capital flows. Where necessary, the inter -
national community can also provide support.

The performance of German credit 
institutions  in 2019
Overall, German credit institutions’ profitability deteriorated in 2019 compared with the previous 
year, although this was due primarily to the overshadowing impact of a negative one- off effect 
stemming from strategic restructuring at one big bank. This effect solely concerned the big banks 
category and eclipsed the growth in profit for the financial year observed for all other categories 
of banks. In total, profit for the financial year before tax fell by more than two- thirds to €5.7 bil -
lion. Whilst institutions’ equity base was strengthened again, their return on equity was down by 
2.66 percentage points to just 1.07%.
Despite the challenging market environment and persistently low interest rates, operating income 
declined moderately by €1.9 billion to €118.6 billion, with declining net interest income and a 
smaller trading result being offset in part by higher net commission income and an improved 
other operating result. Administrative spending edged upwards by €2.0 billion to €90.2 billion in 
the period under review. With net valuation charges of €6.7 billion, the result from the valuation 
of assets was virtually unchanged compared with 2018. The negative balance recorded in the 
other and extraordinary account more than doubled to €16.1 billion, mainly as a result of high 
value adjustments to participating interests in affiliated enterprises at one big bank.
Besides the persistence of the low interest rate setting, the impact of the real economic crisis in 
the wake of the coronavirus pandemic is another factor that is likely to weigh on German credit 
institutions’ profitability this year. Depending on the speed of the economic recovery, credit 
default risks could first materialise and then necessitate value adjustments and depreciation. 
There is considerable uncertainty surrounding the future course of the crisis and its implications 
for the economy.Deutsche Bundesbank

Profitability and cost 
efficiency  of the categories 
of banks
As in previous years, the market environment 
was challenging for German credit institutions 
in 2019. Overall, the downturn in German in -
dustry continued in the 2019 reporting year. 
Added to this was the uncertainty swirling 
around Brexit and intensifying international 
trade conflicts. However, sectors with a more 
domestic focus remained on an expansionary 
path. There was thus no recession in the sense 
of a persistent, broad- based and distinct drop 
in economic activity. Averaged across the year, 
real gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 0.6% 
on the year in 2019, having expanded by 1.5% 
in 2018.
Despite much weaker growth in corporate 
profits, valuations in the global bond markets, 
and in some cases the equity markets, were still 
high, historically speaking. Gains were recorded 
in all categories of assets traded in the financial 
markets, with equity markets scoring particu -
larly well, though Bunds and US Treasuries also 
benefited.
In view of the slight deterioration in the price 
outlook over the summer, the ECB Governing 
Council lowered the deposit rate slightly in 
September of last year and also adopted a 
package of measures intended to comprehen -
sively ease monetary policy. This included the 
resumption of net asset purchases and adjust -
ments to its communications on the conditions 
for a first policy rate hike (forward guidance). 
To preserve favourable bank lending conditions 
and ensure the smooth transmission of monet -
ary policy, the Governing Council also agreed 
on a third series of targeted longer- term refi -
nancing operations (TLTRO- III).
Individual accounts prepared in accordance 
with the German Commercial Code ( Handels -
gesetzbuch ) indicate that operating income1 
for the 1,440 credit institutions analysed below 
fell by €1.9 billion compared with 2018 to €118.6 billion in 2019. This decline was due, in 
particular, to a €4.7 billion decrease in net 
interest income compared with 2018 and to 
around €1.1 billion being wiped off the trading 
result. Although net commission income and 
the other operating result saw year- on- year in -
creases of €1.7 billion and €2.1 billion, respect -
ively, this was not enough to offset the lower 
net interest income and trading result figures.
Looking at each category of banks individually, 
it is clear that big banks were the main drivers 
of the overall decline in profitability. Due, in 
particular, to a negative one- off effect stem -
ming from strategic restructuring at one institu -
tion,2 big banks’ net interest income and net 
commission income fell, as a result of which 
they recorded a sharp €3.1 billion decline in 
their operating income to €27.6 billion. At 
€29.7 billion, operating income generated by 
savings banks was €0.9 billion lower in 2019 
than in the year before. By contrast, credit co -
operatives were able to raise their operating in -
come slightly by €0.2 billion on the previous 
year to €22.1 billion. The largest increase in op -
erating income – a rise of €1.6 billion to €20.8 
billion in 2019 – was recorded by regional 
banks and other commercial banks. Besides 
higher net commission income, their improved 
other operating result was a major contributing 
factor here.
Profit for the financial year
In 2019, German credit institutions reported 
profit for the financial year before tax totalling 
€5.7 billion. This amounted to a year- on- year 
decline of €13.2 billion (around 70%). In add -
ition to lower operating income, this develop -
ment was driven primarily by the negative bal -Business envir -

Methodological notes
Data based on individual accounts pre-
pared in accordance with the German 
Commercial Code and on monthly bal-
ance sheet statistics
The results from the profi  t and loss ac-
counts are based on the published annual 
reports of the individual institutions in ac-
cordance with the provisions set forth in 
the German Commercial Code ( Handels-
gesetzbuch) and the Regulation on the 
Account ing of Credit Institutions (Verord-
nung über die Rechnungslegung der Kredit-
institute). In terms of their conception, 
structure and defi  nitions, they differ from 
the International Financial Reporting Stand-
ards (IFRS)1 for publicly traded banking 
groups. This means that – from a methodo-
logical viewpoint  – business performance 
and certain balance sheet or individual 
profi  t and loss items are not comparable 
across the national and international ac-
counting frameworks. For reasons of com-
parability within Germany, it is advisable to 
consider the individual accounts when ana-
lysing fi  nancial performance. The fi  gures for 
balance sheet capital (total equity), total 
assets and other stock variables are not ob-
tained from the annual reports but are 
taken as annual average values on the basis 
of the monthly balance sheet statistics re-
ported for the institution as a whole.
Reporting group
The reporting group for statistics on banks’ 
profi  t and loss accounts (profi  t and loss 
statistics) includes all banks that are monet-
ary fi  nancial institutions (MFIs) which con-
form to the defi  nition of a CRR credit insti-
tution as set forth in Article 4(1) number 1 
of Regulation (EU) No  575/ 2013 and are 
domiciled in Germany. Branches of foreign banks that are exempted from the provi-
sions of Section 53 of the German Banking 
Act (Kreditwesengesetz), banks in liquid-
ation and banks with a fi  nancial year of less 
than 12 months (truncated fi  nancial year) 
are not included in this performance analy-
sis.
Calculation of the long- term average
At the launch of monetary union in 1999, 
the reporting group relevant for calculating 
the money supply and for monetary analy-
sis was uniformly defi  ned by the ECB for the 
euro area as a whole and designated as the 
monetary fi  nancial institutions (MFI) sector. 
Unlike the population of banks used for the 
Bundesbank analysis up to that point, build-
ing and loan associations are also included. 
Except where another time period is expli-
citly mentioned, the calculations with re-
gard to the longer- term average cover the 
years since the launch of monetary union, 
i.e. from 1999 to 2019.
1 IFRS- based fi  nancial statements are of relevance, for 
instance, to matters of macroprudential analysis and 
oversight concentrating on systemically important banks 
and their international business activities (including 
their foreign subsidiaries). For details, see Deutsche 
Bundesbank (2013).Deutsche Bundesbank

ance in the other and extraordinary account,3 
which more than doubled on the previous year 
to -€16.1 billion in 2019. Overall, this left a loss 
of €2.1 billion for the financial year after tax. In 
2018, German institutions had posted a signifi -
cant profit for the financial year after tax of 
€12.2 billion.
A breakdown by category of banks shows here, 
too, that declining profit for the financial year 
before tax was mainly attributable to burdens 
stemming from strategic restructuring at one 
institution belonging to the big banks category. 
Big banks’ profit of €1.1 billion for the 2018 
finan cial year before tax thus made way for a loss of €17.5 billion in 2019. The lion’s share of 
the decline was due to the balance in the other 
and extraordinary account moving further into 
negative territory: due in large part to the de -
preciation of and value adjustments to partici -Major income and cost items for individual categories of banks in 2019p

pating interests, shares in affiliated enterprises 
and securities treated as fixed assets at one in -
stitution, the loss increased almost sixfold com -
pared with 2018 to reach -€12.5 billion. In add -
ition, lower operating income, slightly higher 
administrative spending and a €4.3 billion 
increase  in net valuation charges also had a 
negative impact on big banks’ profit for the 
finan cial year before tax.
Unlike big banks, all other categories of banks4 
increased their profit for the 2019 financial year 
compared with 2018. Landesbanken recorded 
an increase of €1.8 billion, mainly on account 
of an improved result from the valuation of 
assets. After reporting losses in 2018, Landes -
banken thus recorded an overall profit of €0.8 
billion for the financial year before tax in 2019. 
Regional banks and other commercial banks 
raised their profit for the financial year by €1.1 
billion to €3.3 billion in 2019.
In 2019, credit cooperatives recorded a signifi -
cant increase in their profit for the financial 
year before tax, which climbed by €1.2 billion 
compared with 2018 to around €7.6 billion. By 
contrast, at €8.2 billion, this figure was virtually 
unchanged on the previous year for savings 
banks. This development is largely down to 
two factors. First, in 2019, savings banks’ oper -
ating income fell comparatively sharply owing 
to a €0.7 billion decline in net interest income 
and a €0.7 billion decrease in their other oper -
ating result. By contrast, credit cooperatives 
were able to raise their operating income 
slightly by €0.2 billion. Second, the favourable 
development of the result from the valuation of 
assets had a less pronounced impact on sav -
ings banks than on credit cooperatives. While 
savings banks cut their net valuation charges 
by €0.4 billion to €0.3 billion, credit coopera -
tives’ valuation result was €1.4 billion higher on 
the year and thus even ventured into positive 
territory, at €0.5 billion.
For the first time since the two crisis years of 
2008 and 2009, there were net withdrawals 
from the reserves5 in 2019 totalling €13.2 bil -lion, marking a departure from the net trans -
fers of €8.4 billion in the previous year. How -
ever, this was driven primarily by the offsetting 
of a loss that was incurred as a result of stra -
tegic restructuring at one big bank. Overall, 
there were thus withdrawals from reserves and 
participation rights capital of €21.7 billion in 
the big banks category.
By contrast, as in previous years, savings banks 
and credit cooperatives were the main categor -
ies of banks to strengthen their equity base in 
2019, with net transfers to reserves (€4.4 billion Net capital with -

and €4.2 billion, respectively). Transfers to the 
fund for general banking risks pursuant to the 
Section 340g of the Commercial Code ac -
counted for the lion’s share of these (around 
€4.1 billion for savings banks and around €3.6 
billion for credit cooperatives).
Return on equity and return 
on assets
Overall, the return on equity (profit for the fi -
nancial year before tax in relation to balance 
sheet equity) before tax fell by 2.66 percentage 
points compared to 2018 to 1.07% in the re -
porting year, leaving it far below the long- term 
average (5.36%). The reduction reflects, first, 
the decline in profit for the financial year. 
Second, in the period under review, German 
credit institutions’ balance sheet equity in -
creased by €21.7 billion to €527.2 billion, 
amounting to growth of 4.3%.6 The balance 
sheet equity ratio decreased marginally from 6.23% to 6.18% due to annual average total 
assets rising more strongly than equity in 2019.
The decline in the return on equity was also 
driven largely by the one- off effect at one insti -
tution belonging to the big banks category. The 
return on equity before tax in this category of 
banks fell from 1.14% in the previous year to 
-16.63% in the current reporting year.
Savings banks’ return on equity dipped slightly 
by 0.33 percentage point to 6.86%. By con -
trast, credit cooperatives increased their return 
on equity by 1.04 percentage points to 9.23%, 
thus bringing them closer to their long- term 
average (10.76%), unlike savings banks.
Landesbanken also saw a particularly sharp 
rise. While their return on equity was still nega -
tive in 2018 (-2.45%), the 2019 figures were, at 
2.03%, significantly higher than the long- term 
average of 1.27%, primarily on account of the 
strong improvement in the result from the valu -
ation of assets compared with the previous 
year. Excluding big banks, the other categories 
of banks7 raised their return on equity by 
1.1 percentage points on aggregate to 5.48% 
in the reporting period.
An analysis of the return on assets (profit for 
the financial year before tax in relation to an -
nual average total assets) paints a generally 
similar picture to the one for the return on 
equity. All in all, the return on assets contracted 
from 0.23% in 2018 to 0.07% in the reporting 
year. However, this decline is also mainly attrib -
utable to the aforementioned developments at 
one big bank. The other categories of banks Return on equity

6 When interpreting the data on the equity base, which are 
calculated as annual average values, it should be borne in 
mind that the amounts transferred from the profit for the 
respective financial year do not increase balance sheet 
equity until the year after the annual accounts are adopted, 
while withdrawals from equity items are to be deducted at 
the latest when the annual accounts are prepared.

raised their return on assets on aggregate by 
0.07 percentage point compared with the pre -
vious year to 0.38% in 2019.
Cost efficiency
Measured by the cost/  income ratio under its 
broad definition (administrative spending rela -
tive to operating income), German credit insti -
tutions’ cost efficiency deteriorated overall 
compared with the previous year,8 with the 
cost/ income ratio rising by 2.9  percentage 
points year on year to 76.0%.
This increase was attributable, first, to higher 
administrative spending than in the previous 
year. This was on account of both a slight rise 
in staff costs and to higher other administrative 
spending, the increase in which, according to 
institutions’ annual reports, was due in particu -
lar to additional costs in connection with on -
going digitalisation. Second, operating income declined in 2019, mainly on the back of the 
one- off effect at one big bank, as explained 
above. As a result, the deterioration in the 
overall cost/ income ratio was also driven to a 
large extent by this one- off effect. In the re -
porting period, big banks’ cost/ income ratio 
rose significantly by 13.0 percentage points to 
100.9%.
By contrast, mortgage banks, in particular, 
were able to improve their cost/ income ratio by 
8.6 percentage points. The cost/ income ratio of 
savings banks and Landesbanken deteriorated 
by 3.1 percentage points and 1.9 percentage 
points, respectively, in 2019 compared with the 
previous year. In both cases, this was attribut -
able to rising administrative costs; savings 
banks also reported a decline in operating in -
come. Credit cooperatives recorded only a Overall further

(73.0%) and savings banks (71.4%). In the case 
of big banks, by contrast, it accounted for a 
comparatively small share of operating income 
(58.5%).
Totalling €82.5 billion in 2019, net interest in -
come was significantly below the already low 
level recorded in the previous year (€87.2 bil -
lion). This was mainly due to a €5.0 billion de -
cline in interest income in the broader sense9 to 
€162.8 billion, compared with only a slight re -
duction in interest expenditure by €0.3 billion 
to €80.3 billion. By contrast, net interest in -
come in the narrower sense, at €71.9 billion, 
was almost on a par with the previous year’s 
figure of €71.8 billion.
Despite a slight decline compared with the pre -
vious year, primary institutions again generated 
just under half of total net interest income in 
2019, making €37.5 billion (previous year: 
€38.3 billion). However, big banks’ net interest 
income fell by €3.6 billion to €16.1 billion. Al -

of net interest income overall, they were thus 
responsible for around three- quarters of the 
total year- on- year decline. This was due to a 
€2.6 billion decrease in current income from 
variable- yield securities, participating interests 
and shares in affiliated enterprises compared 
with 2018, as well as a €2.7 billion reduction in 
income from profit transfers in connection with 
the restructuring measures undertaken at one 
big bank.
Although, on the whole, interest income in the 
narrower sense remained virtually unchanged 
on the year, developments varied to some ex -
tent across the individual categories of banks. 
Compared with the previous year, only big 
banks and Landesbanken succeeded in gener -
ating significantly higher interest income. Big 
banks’ interest income in the narrower sense 
rose by €2.2 billion (7.5%) year on year to 
€31.6 billion in 2019. Landesbanken recorded 
an increase of €2.8 billion (11.6%) to €26.7 bil -
lion in the same period. In both cases, how -
ever, a mixed picture emerged when looking at 
institutions individually: while some institutions 
recorded significant growth, the interest in -
come generated by the remaining institutions 
remained unchanged at – or fell short of – the 
previous year’s level.
Savings banks recorded a decline in their inter -
est income in the narrower sense, which fell by 
€0.9 billion (3.7%) to €24.1 billion. Credit co -
operatives also saw their interest income de -
crease by €0.4 billion (2.1%) to €17.6 billion.
The reduction in interest income in the nar -
rower sense at regional banks and other com -
mercial banks by €2.5 billion (10.9%) to €20.1 
billion was due to one institution being re -
moved from the reporting group of regional 
banks and other commercial banks.10
With an annual growth rate of 4.8%, lending 
to the domestic private non- financial sector 
rose more strongly in the reporting year than in 
the year before for the sixth consecutive year. A 
higher rate of credit growth was last recorded in 2000. All the same, interest income in the 
narrower sense decreased again for most cat -
egories of banks. According to the monthly 
balance sheet statistics, loans to the private 
sector rose by €137.5 billion net in absolute 
terms across all categories of banks, with 
around half being attributable loans to house -
holds for house purchase. Many of these loans 
were granted by savings banks and credit co -
operatives (around 29% and 25%, respect -
ively), which are particularly dependent on de -
posit and lending business. Big banks contrib -
uted only around 14% to growth in loans.11Overall, interest

11 Banks reported in the Bank Lending Survey (BLS) that 
demand for loans, especially loans to households for house 
purchase, had increased owing to the low general interest 
rate level (see also Deutsche Bundesbank 2019/ 2020, Janu -

The interest margin generated by German 
credit institutions (net interest income in rela -
tion to total assets) fell by 0.1 percentage point 
on the year to 0.97% in 2019. As credit co -
operatives and savings banks make most of 
their income from interest- related business, 
they generated the highest interest margins, as 
in the past: these stood at 1.70% (-0.1 percent -
age point compared with 2018) and 1.61% 
(-0.12 percentage point compared with 2018), 
respectively. By contrast, big banks’ interest 
margin amounted to only 0.65% in the 2019 
reporting year (previous year: 0.84%).
A breakdown by asset/  liability and structural 
margins12 reveals that the latter was largely re -
sponsible for the diminishing interest margin. 
Whilst asset margins tended to widen in 2019,13 
the interest rate spread between short-  term 
and long- term risk- free investments in the low 
interest rate setting amounted to only 0.5 per -
centage point at the end of 2019 (end- 2018: 
0.95 percentage point).14 The further flattening Interest margins

12 The asset/ liability margin is the assets/ liabilities- side mar -
gin contribution expressed in percentage points. This repre -
sents the difference between the interest rate charged on a 
loan/ interest paid on a deposit and an alternative transac -
tion of equal maturity in the money or capital market. The 
structural margin is the structural contribution to net inter -
est income expressed in percentage points. This contribu -
tion is generated by banks’ maturity transformation, the 
process in which assets such as loans with longer interest 
rate fixation periods are generally higher- yielding than the 
liabilities used to finance them, e.g. deposits with short 
interest rate fixation periods. See Deutsche Bundesbank 
(2018), p. 42.
13 The institutions participating in the Bank Lending Survey 
reported a widening of asset margins on both average and 
riskier loans to firms and riskier loans to households for 
house purchase in 2019. At the same time, credit standards 
and credit terms and conditions were tightened for loans 
to firms, in particular, in the first three quarters of 2019 
owing to worsening costs of funds or elevated balance 
sheet constraints and an increased perception of risk. See 
Deutsche Bundesbank (2019/ 2020), April 2019, July 2019, 
October 2019 and January 2020 survey rounds.
14 In order to calculate the interest rate spread, the esti -
mated interest rates of listed Federal securities with a re -
sidual term to maturity of one and ten years from the cap -
ital market statistics were compared. The term structure on 
the bond market shows the relationship between the inter -
est rates and term to maturity of default- free zero coupon 
bonds. For information on estimating the term structure of

of the yield curve in the course of 2019 made it 
more difficult to generate earnings from matur -
ity transformation, despite the fact that institu -
tions continued the practice of maturity trans -
formation on a large scale in the reporting 
year.15
In addition, the negative deposit facility rate 
dampened net interest income in the reporting 
year as well.16 This initially stood at -0.4%, be -
fore dipping to -0.5% from mid-  September 
2019. By contrast, the two- tier system for re -
munerating excess liquidity holdings introduced 
in the fourth quarter of 2019 is likely to have 
had a positive impact.17
Despite the negative deposit facility rate, the 
zero lower bound largely retained its binding 
effect, and institutions passed on negative 
interest rates to depositors to only a limited ex -
tent in the current reporting year, too. How -
ever, clear differences were observed between 
deposits from non- financial corporations and 
those from households. A large number of in -
stitutions charged negative interest rates on 
sight deposits from non- financial corporations 
in 2019.18 For retail deposits, however, negative 
interest rates were still the exception. Never -
theless, interest rates on deposits from retail 
customers also saw further cuts.19
Net commission income
Net commission income includes income gen -
erated by the provision of services to custom -
ers. Institutions earn commission income, for 
example, through fees for account manage -
ment, from the settlement of securities transac -
tions as well as from the brokerage of real es -
tate, savings and loan contracts, and insur -
ance.20
The net commission income generated by 
German  credit institutions in 2019 increased by 
€1.7 billion (5.8%) on the previous year to 
€31.2 billion. In relation to operating income, 
net commission income was the second most important source of income, accounting for 
26.3%, and its significance has gone up con -
siderably on the previous year. With the excep -
tion of 2008, it has now reached the highest 
level recorded since 1999. Net commission in -
come has thus had a stabilising effect on in -
come in the low interest rate environment of 
2019. The commission margin (net commission 
income in relation to total assets) stood at 
0.37% in the reporting year and remained vir -
tually unchanged on the previous year (0.36%) 
owing to the increase in the aggregate of an -
nual average total assets which was also re -
corded in the reporting year.
The net commission income of savings banks 
and credit cooperatives, in particular, increased, 
by €0.5 billion (6.2%) and €0.3 billion (5.7%), 
respectively. As commission margins in both 
categories of banks are more or less constant 
(savings banks: 0.64%; credit cooperatives: 
0.57%), this would suggest that this develop -
ment is due to a larger customer base rather 
than higher fees, as the expansion of credit and 
deposit business simultaneously pushed up 
total assets.
The net commission income of regional banks 
and other commercial banks also rose signifi -
cantly by €1.0 billion (around 27%), which is Limited pass-

annual average total assets, in 2019 the share of sight de -
posits rose slightly on the year, climbing by 0.6 percentage 
point to 27.6%, while the share of term deposits fell by 
around 1 percentage point to 10.8%. At the same time, 
81.6% of loans issued by German institutions to domestic 
customers at the end of 2019 were loans of a long- term 
nature. Relative to annual average total assets, the share of 
long- term loans in 2019 remained unchanged year on year, 
at around 30%.

likely to have been partly attributable to shifts 
in business lines as a result of Brexit. By con -
trast, big banks recorded a decline of €0.4 bil -
lion (4%) to €10.2 billion.
Net result from the trading 
portfolio
The net result from the trading portfolio fell by 
€1.1 billion, or more than 30%, to €2.4 billion 
in 2019. Its share in operating income slipped 
to 2.0% (previous year: 2.9%). Although fluctu -
ations of this magnitude are not exceptional, 
the year under review saw the lowest trading 
result since the 2008 financial crisis. The sharp 
decline was chiefly driven by losses from de -
rivatives at one institution belonging to the big 
banks category.
The trading result represents a major compon -
ent of income only for big banks (at €1.3 bil -
lion, or 4.7% of operating income) and Landes -
banken (at €0.5 billion, or 6.4% of operating 
income). Together, both categories of banks 
generated around 73% (previous year: around 
82%) of the overall trading result.
Other operating result
The other operating result is a summary item 
used to record income and charges from oper -
ating business that have no connection to net 
interest income, net commission income or the 
trading result.21 At €2.5 billion (2.1% of operat -
ing income), it increased almost sevenfold on 
the previous year (2018: €0.4 billion). In 2019, 
the importance of this item for the German 
banking system as a whole was thus on a par 
with the trading result. This development is pri -
marily attributable to both big banks, where Reduced net

the increase of €1.8 billion virtually cancelled 
out the negative balance of €1.9 billion from 
the previous year, as well as regional banks and 
other commercial banks (+€0.9 billion).
Administrative spending
Administrative spending encompasses staff 
costs and other administrative spending. In the 
reporting year, this item rose by 2.3% to a total 
of €90.2 billion, thus remaining well above the 
long- term average of €83.5 billion. Staff costs 
recorded only a marginal increase of €0.2 bil -
lion to €44.5 billion. However, other adminis -
trative spending was up by €1.9 billion, or 
4.3%, to €45.7 billion. This mainly affected big 
banks as well as regional banks and other com -
mercial banks. In 2019, the year- on- year in -
crease in other administrative spending 
amounted to €0.7 billion for big banks and 
€0.5 billion for regional banks and other com -
mercial banks.
Despite the ongoing consolidation process and 
further thinning down of the branch network, 
staff costs – at an average of 49.3% – still ac -
counted for just under half of administrative 
spending (previous year: 50.2%). The share is 
still comparatively high for savings banks 
(61.7%) and credit cooperatives (57.3%). This 
largely reflects their staffing- intensive business 
model with many branches throughout Ger -
many. By contrast, big banks’ share of staff 
costs in administrative spending is compara -
tively small (38.9%). In relation to annual aver -
age total assets, savings banks and credit co -
operatives also had the highest staffing costs 
(0.99% and 0.89%, respectively). Across all 
categories of banks, this share amounted to 
0.52%.
Other administrative spending includes, for ex -
ample, investment in product development, in -
formation technology, and digitalisation.22 In

comprises depreciation of and value adjust -
ments to tangible and intangible assets; these 
were €1.0 billion up on the year. The increase 
thus accounted for just over half of the total 
increase in other administrative spending and 
was mainly attributable to big banks (+€0.9 bil -
lion).
According to German credit institutions’ annual 
reports, ongoing digitalisation as well as con -
sultancy costs and the costs of adapting IT sys -
tems to regulatory requirements drove their 
spending up further. As in the previous year, 
other administrative spending was reduced, 
inter alia, by the closure of branches and of -
fices.

as are transfers and releases relating to undis -

However, there was a sharp year- on- year in -
crease in net valuation charges, primarily for 
big banks, where figures were up twelvefold to 
almost €4.7 billion. This development was 
driven primarily by intra- group value adjust -
ments at one big bank.
By contrast, the net valuation charges for other 
categories of banks fell significantly in some 
cases compared with the previous year, thus 
virtually offsetting the negative development at 
big banks overall. Landesbanken improved 
their valuation result from -€2.6 billion in 2018 
to -€0.3 billion in the reporting year. Here, too, 
the development was driven mainly by a single 
institution, where the reduction of its shipping 
loan portfolio had led to high depreciation in 
2018, but this no longer weighed on the valu -
ation result in 2019. In addition, Landesbanken 
released risk provisions they had set up in pre -
vious years.
Credit cooperatives improved their valuation re -
sult by €1.4 billion, in particular owing to posi -
tive valuation effects on the securities portfolio 
and the release of risk provisions from previous 
years, putting their net valuation income at 
€0.5 billion in 2019. Savings banks likewise re -
corded an improved valuation result for 2019 
compared with the previous year, not least due 
to releasing risk provisions. However, unlike 
credit cooperatives, savings banks also reported 
a €0.4 billion fall in net valuation charges on 
the year to €0.3 billion in the reporting year.
Regional banks and other commercial banks re -
duced their net valuation charges by around 
€0.5 billion compared with the previous year to 
€1.0 billion in 2019, predominantly as a result 
of lower depreciation of and value adjustments 
to loans and advances, and provisions for con -
tingent liabilities and for commitments.
Other and extraordinary result
The negative balance in the other and extraor -
dinary account25 more than doubled compared with the previous year to €16.1 billion. This de -
velopment was driven primarily by high value 
adjustments at one big bank, which caused the 
result from financial investment business in this 
category of banks to deteriorate massively by 
€11.2 billion to -€11.4 billion. Overall, big banks 
recorded a negative balance of -€12.5 billion in 
the other and extraordinary account in 2019 
(previous year: -€2.2 billion).
In addition, regional banks and other commer -
cial banks also recorded a negative balance of 
-€3.1 billion (previous year: -€2.7 billion), largely 
driven by subsidiaries of foreign institutions

ent institutions on the basis of profit pooling, a

transfer agreement.
Savings banks improved the balance in the 
other and extraordinary account by €0.8 billion 
to around zero. This improvement was mainly 
due to lower depreciation of and value adjust -
ments to participating interests, shares in affili -
ated enterprises and securities treated as fixed 
assets. In the previous year, depreciation of a 
Landesbank at certain savings banks had a 
negative impact on the group result. Credit 
coopera tives’ balance (-€0.2 billion) was un -
changed on the year.
Outlook
Since the end of 2019, the economic outlook 
has become bleaker again. In the second quar -
ter of 2020, the coronavirus pandemic trig -
gered the largest decline in economic output in Germany since the beginning of the quarterly 
calculations of GDP published by the Federal 
Statistical Office for the period from 1970 on -
wards.26 This is also likely to have an adverse 
impact on the profitability of German credit in -
stitutions in 2020. However, due to the high 
degree of uncertainty regarding the pace of 
recovery  in both the German and the global 
economy, it is currently difficult to reliably as -
sess the impact of the crisis.
In contrast to the financial crisis of 2008 and 
2009, the current situation is primarily affecting 
the real economy. Therefore, the main threat is 
likely to be depreciation and value adjustments 
in the corporate lending business. Deferrals of 
interest and redemption payments could also 
weigh on interest- related business and thus on 
net interest income, albeit to a lesser extent.

countermeasures and, since the first quarter of Economic crisis

2020, have increasingly tightened both credit 
standards and credit terms and conditions in 
anticipation of higher risks of default,27 these 
measures only affect new lending business.
However, positive developments can also be 
observed, at least with regard to crisis- related 
and cyclical credit risks. While the picture ob -
tained from economic indicators in the second 
quarter of 2020 is mixed, there are growing 
signs that industrial output has already bot -
tomed out and that the economic recovery will 
continue in the second half of 2020.28 This is 
likely to have a positive impact on the develop -
ment of credit risk for German banks and to 
curb the expected crisis- induced rise in credit 
defaults compared with 2019.Furthermore, the profitability of German insti -
tutions is likely to continue to be affected by 
factors unrelated to the coronavirus pandemic. 
The foreseeable persistence of the low interest 
rate phase will keep weighing on traditional 
interest business and cause further consider -
able pressure to cut costs. In addition, invest -
ment in digitalisation will continue to pose a 
major challenge for the industry in the future.Growing signs

associations), money market funds, and the European Central Bank and national central
banks (the Eurosystem).  1 Source: ECB.  2 In Germany, only savings deposits.

portfolios of securities issued by MFIs in the euro area.  4 In Germany, bank debt
securities with maturities of up to one year are classed as money market paper.5 Excluding liabilities arising from securities issued.  6 After deduction of inter-MFI

* The interest rate statistics gathered on a harmonised basis in the euro area from
January 2003 are collected in Germany on a sample basis. The MFI interest rate
statistics are based on the interest rates applied by MFIs and the related volumes of
euro-denominated deposits and loans to households and non-financial corporations
domiciled in the euro area. The household sector comprises individuals (including sole
proprietors) and non-profit institutions serving households. Non-financial corporations
include all enterprises other than insurance corporations, banks and other financial
institutions. The most recent figures are in all cases to be regarded as provisional.
Subsequent revisions appearing in the following Monthly Report are not specially
marked. Further information on the MFI interest rate statistics can be found on the
Bundesbank’s website (Statistics/Money and capital markets/Interest rates and
yields/Interest rates on deposits and loans).  o The statistics on outstanding amounts are
collected at the end of the month.  1 The effective interest rates are calculated either asannualised agreed interest rates or as narrowly defined effective rates. Both calculation
methods cover all interest payments on deposits and loans but not any other related
charges which may occur for enquiries, administration, preparation of the documents,
guarantees and credit insurance.  2 Data based on monthly balance sheet statistics.
3 Secured and unsecured loans for home purchase, including building and home
improvements; including loans granted by building and loan associations and interim
credits as well as transmitted loans granted by the reporting agents in their own name
and for their own account.  4 Loans for consumption are defined as loans granted for
the purpose of personal use in the consumption of goods and services.  5 For the
purpose of these statistics, other loans are loans granted for other purposes such as
business, debt consolidation, education, etc.  6 Including overdrafts (see also footnotes
12 to 14 on p. 47 ).
