Economic conditions
Underlying trends
Following the strong start to the year, the Ger -
man economy is likely to have taken a brief 
pause in the second quarter of 2016 and shown 
marginal growth, at most. Industrial output at 
the end of the period under review fell below 
the high level of the first quarter. This is particu-
larly true in the case of construction activity. 
The boom in construction at the beginning of 
the year was probably largely attributable to 
production that was brought forward on ac -
count of the mild weather. The retail sector has not generated any stimulus of late either, which 
could signal subdued growth in private con -
sumption. By contrast, the quite positive pic -
ture for goods exports had a stabilising effect. 
The underlying trend in the economy is still 
quite robust, however, and a significant in-
crease in aggregate output is expected again 
for the third quarter. The factors driving the 
domestically-  l ed upturn – the very positive la -
bour market situation, rising real wages and an 
expansionary fiscal policy – remain intact. The 
persistently favourable sentiment among busi -
nesses and households also suggests that the 
dip in the second quarter was only temporary. 
It is hard at present to gauge how the outcome 
of the referendum on the United Kingdom’s 
continued membership of the European Union 
will affect the German economy, but the im -
pact will probably be limited in the short term.
Industry
After seasonal adjustment, industrial output in 
Germany saw a steep month-  on-  month decline 
in May. The fall of 1¾% was probably due in 
part to the unusually large number of “bridge 
days” in May this year. The automotive industry 
stood out in particular, reducing its output 
sharply again following the very substantial growth in the previous month. On an average 
of April and May, industrial output was thus 
distinctly down on the level of the first quarter 
(-1%). This was due mainly to the decline in the 
case of manufacturers of capital goods (-1½%).
Industrial orders in May were unchanged on 
the month in seasonally adjusted terms and on 
an average of April and May were distinctly 
down on their level in the first quarter. The de -
crease (-½%) was due mainly to a quite consid -
erable decline in orders from countries outside 
the euro area (-5¼%), where, above all, Ger -
man manufacturers of machinery and equip -
ment sustained particularly severe shortfalls in 
orders (-13½%). There was chiefly a lack of 
large orders in these countries; excepting these, 
the decline in non-  eur o-  ar ea countries was 
clearly smaller. By contrast, the inflow of do -
mestic orders (+1¼%) and, in particular, buoy -
ant demand impulses from the euro area (+4½%) had a stabilising effect, where large 
orders played a key part in the favourable out -
come. Overall, it was only manufacturers of 
intermediate goods that received a higher vol -
ume of orders (+2¾%).
Seasonally adjusted industrial sales in May were 
down by ¾% on the month. This meant that 
the average for April and May was also slightly 
below the level of the first quarter (-¼%). 
Losses were chiefly recorded in domestic busi -
ness (-1¼%). By contrast, sales increased in the 
euro area (+¾%) and in non-  eur o-  ar ea coun -
tries (+½%). Capital goods manufacturers, in 
particular, reaped the benefits of stronger de -
mand in the euro area. Although nominal ex -
ports of goods showed a steep month-  on- 
month decline (-1¾%) in May, a clear increase 
(+1%) was nevertheless recorded on an aver -
age of April and May compared with the first 
quarter of 2016. The increase in exports of 
goods is similarly large in real terms, as export 
prices were not continuing their decline at the 
current end but moving up slightly. Nominal German econ-
omy takes a brief pause in second quarter

goods imports in May were unchanged at the 
previous month’s level. On an average of April 
and May, however, there was a considerable decline compared with the previous quarter 
(-2%), which was slightly higher still (-2¼%) in real terms.
Construction
Construction output in May continued its de-cline of the past few months and contracted 
significantly on the month in seasonally ad -
justed terms (-1%). In addition, the April figure 
was revised downwards. This was due mainly 
to the finishing trades index, which is signifi -
cantly more susceptible to revision than the 
index for the main construction sector. The 
average for April and May was thus quite sig -
nificantly down on the level of the previous 
quarter (-4¾%). The downward movement 
was broadly based with substantial losses in 
both the main construction sector (-5¾%) and 
in the finishing trades (-3¼%). Output con -
tracted more sharply in building construction 
(-7%) than in civil engineering (-4%). This nega -
tive development was due in part to the very mild temperatures last winter, which led to 
temporary higher output, mainly in February 
and December, as well as to a countermove -
ment at the current end. In April (data are avail -
able up to then), however, new orders in the 
main construction sector were not down much 
in comparison with their very high level in the 
previous quarter (-1½%). It is thus becoming in -
creasingly evident that output in this sector is 
not keeping pace with the strong increase in 
new orders since autumn 2015.
Labour market
Employment continues to grow steadily. In 
May, the seasonally adjusted number of per -
sons in work in Germany was 45,000 higher than in April, which was consistent with the 
average rise in the three preceding months. 
The year-  on-  year figure went up to 559,000 Construction

persons, or 1.3%. This was due mainly to the 
substantial increase in jobs subject to social 
security   contributions. Ther e were 681,000, or 
2.2%, more positions filled in April than in the 
same month in 2015. The leading indicators 
suggest that employment will continue to grow 
at much the same pace over the next few 
months. The Ifo employment barometer, the labour market barometer of the Institute for 
Employment Research (IAB) and the Federal 
Employment Agency’s BA-  X job index al l re-
mained more or less at the high level reached 
in the previous month.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment in June de -
creased slightly on the month. 2.69 million per -
sons were registered as unemployed with the 
Federal Employment Agency. As in May, the un-
employment rate was 6.1%. Compared with the 
same month one year earlier, there were 97,000 
fewer persons out of work and the unemploy -
ment rate was 0.3 percentage point lower. The 
decline of the past few months was driven by 
the expansion of labour market policy measures, 
however. This is related in particular to measures 
designed to make refugees that would other -
wise be registered as unemployed ready for 
work and integrate them into the  labour market. 
Hence, total underemployment (excluding short-  
time work) has shown a marked seasonally ad -
justed rise over the past few months. According 
to the labour market barometer of the IAB, 
registered unemployment is unlikely to decline 
any further over the next few months.
Prices
After initially continuing their upward move -
ment in early June, crude oil prices were tend -
ing to edge down again somewhat in the 
second half of the month. On an average of 
June, however, prices rose by almost 5% on the 
month but were still one-  fifth down on the  
year. Crude oil prices were still going down sharply in the first half of July. As this report 
went to press, the price of a barrel of Brent 
crude oil stood at US$48. The premium on crude oil futures was US$2½ for deliveries six 
months ahead and US$4¾ for deliveries 12 
months ahead.
Import and producer prices were up distinctly 
in seasonally adjusted terms in May. Energy be -
came markedly more expensive. However, prices were showing a clear increase even if 
energy   is excluded, after easing in the months 
before. Overall, the year-  o n- y ear decline nar -
rowed to 5.5% in the case of imports and to 
2.7% in the case of industrial products.
Consumer prices rose by a seasonally adjusted 
0.2% in June. As in the previous month, this 
was largely due to higher energy prices driven 
by accelerating crude oil prices. Food prices 
persisted more or less at the previous month’s 
level overall. By contrast, prices of industrial 
goods dropped owing to exceptionally sharp 
price reductions for clothing and footwear. 
Travel services were the main driver behind the 
marked increase in prices for services. The 
moderate upward trend in rents continued. An -
nual Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation went 
up to +0.3%. The Harmonised Index of Con -
sumer Prices (HICP) increased to +0.2% from 
-0.3% and 0.0% in the previous two months. 
Going by current financial market expectations 
of crude oil price movements, the slow rise in 
the rate of inflation is likely to continue in the 
months ahead.

phasis is on recent outturns. The quarterly editions of the 
Monthly Reports (published in February, May, August and 
November), by contrast, contain a detailed description of 
the development of public finances during the preceding 
quarter. For detailed data on budgetary developments and 
public debt, see the statistical section of this report.

recorded a €6 billion deficit in the first quarter 
of 2016. However, this represented only a slight 
deterioration of just under €½ billion on the 
same period of the previous year. Revenue rose 
by a substantial 6% (just over €2½ billion). Tax 
revenue grew at an above-  aver age rate (+9%, 
or just over €1 billion), with local business tax 
(+12%, after deducting the revenue shares 
accruing   to other government levels) playing a 
crucial role. Somewhat clearer still was the in -
crease in current transfers from state govern -
ment (+10½%, or €2 billion). Besides higher 
benefit reimbursements and special-  purpose  
transfers –  not least as compensation for 
refugee-  r elated expenditure  – general grants 
from state government, which are essentially 
pegged to growth in state tax revenue, also 
had a part to play in this. Spending increased 
on a similar scale to revenue (+6%, or €3 bil -
lion). As in previous quarters, this growth 
centred on other operating expenditure (+7%) 
and social benefits (+8½%). In the latter case, 
the provision of support for refugees, in par -ticular, was reflected in a renewed increase in 
benefits for asylum seekers (+148%, or €1 bil -
lion) and, to a lesser extent, in assistance for 
young people as well (+21½%, or €½ billion), 
which also encompasses benefits for unaccom-panied refugee minors. In contrast to this, the 
accommodation costs for recipients of un -
employment welfare benefit (II) were down sharply (-10½%). Personnel expenditure rose 
only moderately (+2½%) given the expiry of the collective wage agreement at the end of Febru -
ary and prior to the entry into force of the next 
pay rise that was recently settled, while strong 
growth was reported for fixed asset formation 
(+10½%).
A deterioration in local government finances is 
also expected for 2016 as a whole (after a sur -
plus of €3 billion in 2015). The relatively moder -
ate wage agreement reached recently (+2½% 
annual average increase for both 2016 and 
2017)3 is likely to have a fairly stabilising effect 
on the growth rates for personnel expenditure. 
However, significant strain is being caused by 
the slowdown in tax revenue growth expected 
for local government (+1%, including the city 
states, according to the May 2016 tax esti -
mate), which is linked, in particular, to out -
standing refunds in the wake of court rulings. 
At the same time, strong spending growth 
– which evidently is not fully offset by transfers 
from state government – in connection with the provision of support for asylum seekers is 
likely to persist as the year goes on, and invest -
ment could continue to pick up significantly.
An improvement in the financial situation looks 
to be on the cards again as soon as next year, 
however. The latest tax estimate, for example, envisages a significant increase in tax revenue, 
which also has its roots in the lapsing of tax 
refund burdens and the decision to top up local government funds by a further €1 billion from the turnover tax revenue that would otherwise Slightly higher

have accrued to central government. Expend -
iture on asylum seeker benefits would have to 
be scaled back again if migration continues at 
a limited pace.4 In addition, a one-  off increase 
of €½ billion in central government’s share of 
accommodation costs for job seekers had al -
ready been agreed upon for 2017. With regard 
to the permanent relief for local government from 2018, as set out in the coalition agree -
ment, it has now been agreed that €1 billion 
will be passed on to local government via state 
government to be spent on integration assis -
tance for people with disabilities, €2½ billion will be transferred to local government from 
central government’s share of turnover tax rev -
enue, and central government’s share in ac -
commodation costs for job seekers will be raised by €1½ billion. These funds mean that 
local government is set to enjoy additional re -
lief of €2½ billion compared with 2017, in view 
of the expiring measures. This should pave the 
way for a further distinct improvement in the 
financial situation, in addition to the desired 
higher investment.
Statutory health insurance 
scheme
According to preliminary data, the statutory 
health insurance scheme recorded a deficit of 
€2 billion in the first quarter of 2016, which 
meant the result was just over €½ billion better 
than the previous year. This improvement is 
largely attributable to the health insurance in -
stitutions, which generated a surplus of €½ bil-
lion. The health fund recorded a virtually un -
changed (seasonal) deficit of €2½ billion.
Owing partly to the 0.25 percentage point in -
crease in the additional contribution rates at 
the start of the year, which took the average to 
1.08%, the health insurance institutions’ rev -
enue grew by just over 5% – stronger5 than the 
4% growth in spending. Expenditure on bene -
fits by the health insurance institutions also 
rose by 4%. Below-  aver age growth was seen 
mainly in spending on hospital treatment (+3%), which constitutes the largest expend -
iture item of the health insurance institutions. 
However, this is attributable, in particular, to a 
one- off effect caused by an accounting change. 
The outlook is for an acceleration for the year 
as a whole owing to the additional expenditure 
stemming from the Hospital Structures Act 
(Krankenhausstrukturgesetz).  Expenditure on 
sickness benefit, which had risen steeply in the 
past few years, remained virtually unchanged 
in the reporting period. In the pharmaceuticals 
sector, growth cooled somewhat and, at 4%, 
matched the increase in overall expenditure on 
benefits. While new treatment methods also 
played a role here in the previous year, discount Usual seasonal

costs for recognised refugees are to be borne in full by cen -
tral government from 2016. Expected expenses of €½ bil -
lion this year, €1 billion next year and €1½ billion the year 
after should thus be absorbed.
5 Revenue consists primarily of transfers from the health 
fund. The fund also collects the additional contributions of 
each health insurance institution and passes them on to 
the individual institutions, thereby balancing out the effects of income differences between their members.Deutsche Bundesbank

agreements between the health insurance insti-
tutions and the pharmaceuticals industry are 
having a stronger dampening effect on costs 
this year. By contrast, above-  aver age growth in 
expenditure was recorded for therapeutic treat -
ment and aids (6½%) as well as for out-  patient 
treatment (4½%).
The health fund saw substantial revenue 
growth of 6% in the first quarter. Contribution 
receipts rose by just over 5%. This was due not only to higher additional contribution rates, but 
also persistently favourable wage and employ -
ment developments, as shown by the fact that 
employee contributions went up by 4½% be -
fore factoring in the rate hike. By contrast, 
however, pension contributions experienced a 
below-  aver age increase of 3%, as the add -
itional contribution rates for pensioners were 
only raised in March 20166 and the increase in 
pensions was weaker than that of employee in -
come subject to compulsory contributions. The 
planned increase of €½ billion in the central 
government grant (which had been reduced in 
previous years) had a positive impact on other 
revenue.
With the return to the regular central govern -
ment grant level of €14 billion, the health fund 
is set to post a more or less balanced result for 
2016 as a whole.7 For the health insurance in -
stitutions, expenditure growth is likely to pick 
up. This is because the previously mentioned 
accounting change for hospital treatment was 
still curbing the increase at the start of the year. 
Furthermore, the agreed benefit increases for 
out- p atient treatment and hospital care, 
amongst other things, have so far been only 
partially implemented and will only have an im -
pact on finances as the year progresses. All things considered, a broadly balanced result 
also seems possible for the health insurance in -
stitutions for the year as a whole.Securities markets
Bond market
At €113.1 billion, gross issuance in the German 
bond market in May 2016 was down only 
slightly on the previous month’s figure (€118.7 
billion). After deducting the significantly lower 
redemptions and taking account of changes in 
issuers’ holdings of their own debt securities, 
net sales of domestic debt securities came to €29.7 billion. Foreign debt securities worth 
€5.2 billion net were placed in the German 
market during the reporting month, which 
meant that the outstanding volume of debt in -
struments in Germany rose by €34.9 billion 
overall.
In May, the public sector issued debt securities 
worth €17.0 billion net (following repayments 
of €12.7 billion in April). Central government 
was the main issuer of new securities (€19.5 
billion), placing chiefly ten-  year Bunds (€5 .0 bil-
lion), two-  year F ederal Treasury notes (Schätze; 
€4.7 billion), five-  year Federal notes (Bobls; 
€4.0 billion) and Treasury discount paper (Bu -
bills; €3.0 billion) in the market. By contrast, the Federal states redeemed their own bonds 
to the value of €2.6 billion in net terms.
In May, domestic credit institutions raised their 
capital market debt by €8.7 billion net com -
pared to €7.2 billion in April. Increases were 
seen primarily in the outstanding volume of 
debt securities issued by specialised credit insti -
tutions (€9.0 billion), which include, for ex -
ample, public promotional banks, but also in 
the outstanding volume of other bank debt 
securities   which can be structur ed flexibly (€1.7 
billion). This contrasted with net redemptions Major revenue

Security Code (Sozialgesetzbuch V). This lag, which is merely of minor importance in relation to total revenue 
anyway, was not factored into the calculation of the trans -

Domestic enterprises issued bonds with a net

compared with net issuance of €2.0 billion one 
month earlier. On balance, the majority of 
issues were attributable to non-  financial enter -
prises (€2.8 billion). It is possible that the deci -
sion in March to expand the Eurosystem’s pur -
chase programme to include corporate sector 
securities already led to a rise in domestic en -
terprises’ issuance activity ahead of the pur -
chases.
The Bundesbank was the main buyer of bonds 
in May (€18.1 billion). Bond purchases under 
the asset purchase programme played the de -
cisive role in this respect. Foreign investors also 
made significant purchases of German secur -
ities for their bond portfolios to the tune of 
€17.6 billion net. Resident non-  banks added 
interest-  bearing paper worth a net €5 .2 billion 
to their portfolios, acquiring exclusively foreign 
debt securities (€6.5 billion) on balance. By 
contrast, resident credit institutions sold debt 
securities for €6.1 billion net, involving mainly 
domestic securities issued by the public sector.
Equity market
In the month under review, domestic enter -
prises issued new shares totalling €0.3 billion 
net in the German equity market. The volume 
of foreign equities in the German market rose 
by €5.5 billion over the same period. On bal -
ance, shares were purchased chiefly by domes -
tic non-  banks (€4 .3 billion), but domestic credit 
institutions were likewise active in the market 
(€2.8 billion). This contrasted with net sales by 
foreign investors totalling €1.4 billion.Mutual funds
German mutual funds recorded net inflows of 
€11.3 billion in May (April: €6.7 billion). Mutual 
funds open to the general public and special -
ised funds reserved for institutional investors 
benefited from this in almost equal measure. 
Among the fund providers, mixed securities-  
based funds and open-  end r eal estate funds 
were the main issuers of new shares (€4.8 bil -
lion and €3.8 billion respectively), but bond 
funds also placed new shares in the market 
(€1.4 billion). The outstanding volume of for -
eign mutual fund units distributed in Germany 
rose by €1.5 billion in the reporting month. 
Domestic   non-  banks wer e the main buyers of 
mutual fund shares in May (€11.7 billion). These 
were primarily domestic securities on balance. 
Domestic credit institutions and foreign invest-
ors purchased mutual fund shares worth €0.9 
billion and €0.2 billion respectively.Rise in enter-

Balance of payments
Germany’s current account recorded a surplus 
of €17.5 billion in May 2016, putting it €10.8 
billion below the level of the previous month. 
This result arose from a markedly lower trade 
surplus combined with a significant decline in 
the invisible current transactions balance, 
which comprises services as well as primary 
and secondary income.
The surplus in the May goods account shrank 
by €4.4 billion on the month to stand at €23.3 
billion on account of the fact that goods ex-
ports fell more strongly than goods imports.
In May, Germany recorded a deficit of €5.8 bil-
lion in invisible current transactions, compared 
with a surplus of €0.7 billion the previous 
month. This decline was primarily caused by a 
reversal in the primary income balance from net receipts totalling €3.2 billion to net ex -
penditure in the amount of €3.4 billion, mainly 
triggered by increased dividend payments to 
non- r esidents. In addition, the deficit on ser -
vices widened by €1.0 billion to €1.8 billion, 
not least on account of increased travel ex-
penditure. By contrast, the secondary income 
deficit narrowed by €1.1 billion to €0.6 billion, 
driven in large part by an upturn in government 
revenue from current taxes on income and 
wealth from non-  r esidents.
In May, changing expectations about US mon -
etary policy exerted pressure on transactions in the international financial markets. As a result, 
German cross-  bor der portfolio investment gen -
erated net capital imports (€5.6 billion) follow -
ing continued high capital outflows in April 
(€46.6 billion in net terms). This turnaround 
was chiefly due to the fact that non-  r esident 
investors switched from selling to purchasing 
(€16.4 billion in May compared with -€25.3 bil -
lion in April), with an overriding emphasis on 
bonds (€15.8 billion), especially paper issued by 
the private sector (€11.7 billion). They also 
demonstrated an interest in money market

Resident investors were active abroad (€10.8 
billion), though to a lesser extent than in previ -
ous months. They acquired foreign bonds, es -

and foreign shares (€4.1 billion), while scaling 
back their holdings of money market paper 
(€3.0 billion).
Direct investment likewise led to net capital im -
ports (€3.9 billion) in May, with enterprises 
domiciled abroad investing capital in the 
amount of €5.7 billion in Germany, primarily 
through intra-  gr oup loans (€5.1 billion). The 
bulk of these funds were provided in the form 
of additional loans (€4.5 billion), channelled to 
German parent companies by affiliates domi -

their foreign equity capital by €4.7 billion while 
trimming their cross-  bor der intra-  gr oup lending 
by €2.8 billion.Other statistically recorded investment, com -

Evolution of the Bank Lending Survey 
since the onset of the financial crisis
During the financial and sovereign debt crisis, the results of the quarterly Bank Lending Survey 
(BLS) provided key indicators for a timely assessment of developments in the German and euro-  
area bank lending markets. The qualitative responses provided by participating banks, which, for 
Germany, the Bundesbank regularly aggregates to national results, not only comprise information on changes in banks’ lending policy and their assessment of demand trends but also pinpoint the relevant driving factors and the respondents’ expectations for the near future. A case in point was the discovery that credit standards were tightened immediately prior to the onset of the financial 
crisis primarily owing to bank-  r elated supply constraints such as funding conditions or the liquid -
ity position, whereas developments in the real sector only became important later on.
Alongside the regular standard questions, the BLS also contains ad hoc questions which enable 
information on new topics to be obtained quickly and flexibly. For instance, over the past few 
years the survey has asked questions on topics such as the impact of regulatory or supervisory 
actions or non-  standar d monetary policy measures. The BLS has therefore been able not only to 
describe crisis phenomena but also to address and evaluate the ways in which supervisors and 
monetary policy makers responded.
Following years of experience with the original catalogue of questions and fundamental change 
during the crisis years, the Eurosystem amended the questionnaire and added detailed explana -
tory comments. The old questionnaire was thus replaced at the start of 2015 by a revised version which promises to yield even deeper insights into an understanding of the development of lend -
ing policy.Deutsche Bundesbank

Bank Lending Survey
At the beginning of 2003, the Eurosystem 
introduced the Bank Lending Survey (BLS), a 
new survey in which senior bank executives are 
regularly asked to provide current information 
on their lending policy as well as to assess de-
mand.1 The purpose of this qualitative survey, 
conducted quarterly, is to develop a compre -
hensive understanding of the monetary trans -
mission process and thus to support monetary 
policy decisions. Since banks play a major role 
in providing funding to enterprises and house-holds in the euro area, it makes particular sense 
to directly survey a representative sample of in -
stitutions in this context. The original survey in -
cluded 17 participating banks from Germany, 
which were selected based both on their own 
market share in lending business and the mar -
ket share of the respective banking group to 
which they are mapped, as recorded in the 
banking statistics. Following enlargements to 
the sample in 2008 and 2012, as well as the 
dropout of individual banks due, for instance, 
to mergers and acquisitions, the German sam-ple now consists of 34 banks.
2 This makes it by 
far the largest sample of all the countries in the 
euro area.
Key to understanding the respondents’ lending 
behaviour is the question of their underlying 
credit standards, essentially meaning the min -
imum requirements to be met by potential bor -
rowers.3 Questions are asked about potential 
determinants, which include not only the sur -
veyed institutions’ risk perception but also their 
risk tolerance, the costs of obtaining funding 
on the money and capital markets, potential 
balance sheet constraints and the competitive 
situation.
Alongside their credit standards, BLS banks 
provide information on the terms and condi -
tions of loans actually approved as laid down in 
the loan contract,4 which includes margins,5 as 
well as an institution-  specific assessment of the 
demand for loans together with its presumed 
determinants. Since credit standards could be affected by the borrowers’ situation, they de -
pend indirectly on loan demand. Conversely, 
credit standards can also impact on demand. 
Credit supply shocks can be calculated in order 
to isolate the supply-  side  impact in the nar -
rower sense (see pages 25 to 28). The revised 
version of the questionnaire,6 which was intro -
duced in 2015, now contains one question on 
factors affecting   cr edit terms and conditions 
and another on the change in the share of re -
jected loan applications.
Current lending policy and demand are as -
sessed – as is the case, in principle, for all other 
questions – as quarterly changes (apart from 
seasonal fluctuations as regards demand). The 
BLS is a qualitative survey with answers in the 
form of stated tendencies on a scale of five Introduction of

opments, Monthly Report, January 2009, pp 15-30.2 The banks in the German national sample are mapped to the following banking groups: large banks, regional banks, Landesbanken, savings banks, credit cooperatives including their regional institutions, and private mortgage banks.
3 Credit standards are a bank’s internal underlying lending 
criteria. They are defined ex ante, ie prior to actual negoti -
ations with potential borrowers on specific terms and condi -
tions. Banks’ credit standards define the types of a loan a bank considers desirable and undesirable, the designated 
sectoral or geographic priorities, the collateral deemed ac -
cepted and unacceptable, etc. Credit standards specify the 
required borrower characteristics (eg balance sheet condi -
tions, income situation, age, employment status) under 
which a loan can be obtained. See also the box on pp 17-19.4 Credit terms and conditions refer to the terms and con -
ditions of loans as actually approved in the loan contracts. 
They generally consist of the agreed spread over the rele -
vant reference interest rate, the size of the loan, the access 
conditions and other terms and conditions in the form of 
non- inter est rate charges (ie fees), collateral or guarantees 
which the respective borrower needs to provide (including 
compensating balances), loan covenants and the agreed 
loan maturity. See also the box on pp 17-19.5 Since the revised version of the questionnaire was intro -
duced in 2015, the loan margin of a bank is understood as 
the spread over a “relevant market reference rate” (e.  g.  
Euribor, Libor or the interest rate swap of a corresponding maturity for fixed-rate loans), depending on the character -
istics of the loan. No definition of the concept of loan mar -
gin existed previously. See also the box on pp 17-19.6 See the box on pp 17-19.Deutsche Bundesbank

Revision of the BLS questionnaire in 2015
In 2015, following more than ten years of 
experience with the Bank Lending Survey (BLS), the questionnaire and the accom-panying compilation guide were reviewed 
with regard to comprehensibility, clarity and 
effectiveness. The fi  nancial crisis led to in-creased interest in comparable cross- country results. However, an informal sur-
vey in 2013 showed that some key concepts 
were being interpreted differently across 
the participating banks and countries. Fur-
thermore, response behaviour for qualita-tive surveys like the BLS is less objectively controllable than for quantitative surveys, 
which maximises the need for precise and 
considered defi  nitions. It was therefore de-cided to word some questions more clearly and to defi  ne key concepts unambiguously. On the other hand, comparability of the re-sponses over time requires continuity in the 
questions in order to avoid a structural break, particularly for important and fre-quently cited indicators such as credit 
standards. Moreover, there is a limit to the 
number of questions that can be asked without unduly burdening banks or jeop-ardising the high participation rate in the BLS, which is run on a voluntary basis. In addition to revising the questionnaire and 
compilation guide, it was decided to better integrate the two documents so as to facili-
tate cross- referencing. Before the amend-
ments were defi  nitively implemented, a test 
survey was carried out with some of the 
banks in the BLS sample so that further ad-justments could be carried out if necessary.
Overall, the standard questionnaire was ex-
tended by fi  ve questions to a total of 23. 
The ad hoc questions are already revised 
regularly and therefore did not feature in this reform concept. The most important changes concerned the conceptual differ-entiation between the credit standards and 
the credit terms and conditions, the con-
cept of loan margins, loan demand and the 
factors affecting demand for loans to 
households for house purchase.
Since the reform of the questionnaire, the 
credit standards are explicitly defi  ned ex 
ante as a bank’s underlying internal lending guidelines prior to any loan negotiations, in contrast to the credit terms and conditions, 
which are negotiated with the borrowers 
and which feed into the loan agreements as actually approved. The credit standards are used as the basis for making concrete deci-sions on the approval or rejection of a loan as they contain provisions on what types of 
loan a bank considers desirable and un-desirable. They specify the required bor-
rower characteristics (eg balance sheet con-
ditions, income situation) under which a loan can be obtained. By contrast, the 
credit terms and conditions, as a compon-
ent of the loan agreements, generally con-sist of the agreed spread over the reference 
interest rate (margin), the size of the loan, 
non- interest rate charges, the loan collat-
eral to be provided by the borrower, coven-
ants and the agreed maturity (original ma-
turity). The credit terms and conditions de-pend on the borrower’s specifi  c characteris-tics and may be subject to change, either in 
parallel with the credit standards or inde-
pendently of them.
As changes in the individual credit terms 
and conditions had only been surveyed sep-arately in the original questionnaire, the re-
vised questionnaire includes a new item that calls for an assessment of the overall 
change in the credit terms and conditions. 
Moreover, a question on the factors affect-
ing the change in the overall terms and Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

conditions as well as margins has been 
introduced. In principle, these factors are 
the same as for the credit standards. How-
ever, in order to limit the length of the 
questionnaire, the individual factors affect-
ing terms and conditions are summarised 
under the four headings “cost of funds and 
balance sheet constraints”, “pressure from 
competition”, “perception of risk” and “risk 
tolerance”, and it is only the impact of these components that is to be assessed. The latter factor, the individual bank’s risk 
tolerance, has been added to all factor lists 
for both credit standards and credit terms and conditions. It refers to the willingness 
of the bank to take risks when lending. This can change as a result of a modifi  cation of 
the bank’s underlying business strategy. By 
contrast, the perception of risk aims to show (as hitherto) how the bank assesses 
current borrower risk and how it reacts to 
changes in the general economic situation 
and outlook, in the industry or fi  rm- specifi  c 
situation and outlook, in the borrower’s creditworthiness and in the collateral de-
manded.
The concept of the loan margin has been 
set out for the fi  rst time in the revised com-pilation guidelines accompanying the ques-
tionnaire. Previously, it was left to each re-
spondent bank itself to defi  ne what it understood as a loan margin; an informal 
survey of banks participating in the BLS re-vealed that this resulted in a plethora of dif-ferent defi  nitions. Since the introduction of 
the revised questionnaire, the loan margin 
of a BLS bank is to be understood as the spread over a “relevant market reference 
rate” (eg Euribor, Libor or the interest rate 
swap of a corresponding maturity for fi  xed- 
rate loans), depending on the characteris-
tics of the loan. Such a spread encompasses 
changes that arise in the individual bank’s 
cost of funds (mainly in connection with re-
fi  nancing via bank debt securities and de-posits) or which are based on the bank’s risk assessment of borrowers. In addition, 
the spread refl  ects changes that arise in any 
other factors not related to variations of 
market rates.
The questionnaire includes a new question 
on the share of rejected loan applications. 
Loan applications should at least include formal loan applications, and ideally also any informal loan requests that have not 
yet reached the stage of a formal loan ap-plication. The responses should refer to the volume of the loan applications, and an es-
timate should be made of the share of 
completely rejected applications.
For the fi  rst time, loan demand was defi  ned 
as the change in nominal gross demand 
compared with the previous quarter. De-
mand includes loan rollovers but disregards 
normal seasonal fl  uctuations. It relates to 
the bank loan fi  nancing need of enterprises and households, independently of whether this need will result in a loan or not.
Some adjustments were also made to the 
factors affecting demand. For example, the general level of interest rates was added as 
a factor for all three loan categories (loans 
to enterprises, loans for house purchase 
and consumer credit and other lending). As it turns out, in light of the low- interest- rate 
environment, this new factor was in fact 
the main driver of the rise in demand in all 
three loan segments in 2015. In addition, 
changes were made to the factors affecting demand for loans to households for house 
purchase. The factor “regulatory and fi  scal 
regime of housing markets” was added in addition to the general level of interest 
rates. In parallel to this, the factor “housing 
market prospects” was amended to be-
come “housing market prospects including 
expected house price developments”, thus 
explicitly capturing the price component. Deutsche Bundesbank

possible responses.7 All questions are asked 
separately for loans to enterprises (mostly sub-
divided into overall loans to enterprises, loans 
to small and medium-  sized enterprises and  
loans to large enterprises), loans to households 
for house purchase, and consumer credit and 
other lending to households. A distinction is 
also made between two different reference 
periods: changes over the past three months 
and banks’ expectations of changes over the 
next three months.
Since the onset of the financial crisis, the stand-
ard questionnaire has been repeatedly aug -
mented with ad hoc questions, the content 
and frequency of which have changed as 
necessary  . Ther e is currently a set of six differ -
ent groups of questions which are posed quar -
terly, half-  yearly (on an alternating schedule) or 
annually.
– Each quarter, the survey contains an ad hoc 
question on the impact of the financial mar -ket situation on banks’ funding conditions 
and lending policy.
– In the January and July rounds, the survey 
asks questions about how banks potentially 
adjust their lending policy to new regulatory 
or supervisory actions and about banks’ par -
ticipation in targeted longer-  term r efinan -
cing operations (TLTROs), and in the April and October rounds the survey contains 
questions about the impact of the Eurosys -
tem’s expanded asset purchase programme 
(EAPP) as well as – beginning with the April 
2016 round – the impact of the negative 
deposit   facility rate.Ad hoc ques-
tions on issues relating to the financial and sovereign debt crisisFurthermore, the factor “household sav-
ings” was renamed “internal fi  nance of house purchase out of savings/down pay-
ment (ie share fi  nanced via the household’s own funds)” and is thus now explicitly inter-
preted as meaning that savings serve to 
substitute other fi  nancing sources and thus 
lower the borrowing requirement, instead 
of, as was previously possible, being able to 
increase it in the case of high own funds being used as collateral. The factor “non- 
housing related consumption expenditure” 
was deleted under the heading demand for 
loans for house purchase. Instead, the list of factors affecting demand for consumer 
credit and other lending to households now 
additionally contains the factor “consump-
tion expenditure fi  nanced through real- 
estate guaranteed loans (“mortgage equity 
withdrawal”)”.11 The questionnaire (standard questions) including the 
ad hoc questions of the given survey round as well as 
the compilation guide can be found on the Bundes-bank’s website at http://www.bundesbank.de/

7 For supply-  r elated questions, the scale comprises the fol -
lowing possible answers: “tightened considerably”, “tight-ened somewhat”, “remained basically unchanged”, “eased 
somewhat” and “eased considerably”. For demand-  r elated 
questions, the range comprises “increased considerably”, “increased somewhat”, “remained basically unchanged”, 
“decreased somewhat” and “decreased considerably”.Deutsche Bundesbank

– In addition, there is a question on banks’ 
current level of credit standards which, since 
2014, has been asked each year in the April 
round.8
The data provided by the German BLS banks 
are obtained through personal interviews. Ger -
many is the only country in the ESCB in which this intensive survey form is conducted; this en-
sures a particularly high quality of data. In Ger -
many, like the other euro-  ar ea countries, the 
individual responses are subsequently aggre -
gated on a question-  by-  question basis to na -
tional results.9 For the questions in the stand -
ard questionnaire, the responses to which are 
on a five-  step scale, net per centages10 are cal -
culated which are published and analysed 
regularly by the Bundesbank. For the ad hoc  
questions, too, net percentages are, wherever

Developments in German 
banks’ lending policy
Since quantitative metrics such as interest rates 
or lending volumes are captured, respectively, 
by the harmonised MFI interest rate statistics 
and the monthly balance sheet statistics, they 
are not included in the BLS. The survey is 
centred on credit standards and credit terms 
and conditions, along with their determinants, 
which are much more difficult or even impos -
sible to quantify. The main difficulty is the lack 
of an individually ascertainable quantitative 
measure of the level of credit standards. This is 
why all standard BLS questions refer to quarter-  
on- quarter changes. B y means of an ad hoc  
question, introduced in 2014 and repeated an -
nually, however, some indication can be ob-
tained of banks’ current level of credit stand -
ards as against a reference value.Credit standards
As regards the evolution of credit standards for 
loans to enterprises, German banks, after re -
porting an easing in the first half of 2007, sub -
sequently tightened them over a more than 
two- year period beginning in the thir d quarter 
of 2007. This period was particularly character -
ised by adjustments owing to the financial mar -
ket crisis following the collapse of the Lehman 
Brothers investment bank in September 2008. 
Thus in the first quarter of 2009, 50% of the 
surveyed German banks, on balance, tightened 
their credit standards for corporate loans; this 
was a larger number of institutions tightening 
simultaneously than ever before and also than 
at any other time over the entire BLS survey BLS results for

8 In 2009 and 2010, the “Special survey on German banks’ lending to domestic enterprises”, which was introduced in July 2009 and initially conducted separately, was integrated 
into the German BLS questionnaire. Against the back -
ground of the debate on the threat of a credit crunch, the 
aim of this survey was to supplement the existing informa -
tion on lending with the banks’ assessments of their ex -
pected lending behaviour 12 months ahead. The participat -
ing institutions were also asked to forecast the develop -
ment of their capital position. See Deutsche Bundesbank, 
Second special survey on German banks’ lending to do -
mestic enterprises, Monthly Report, February 2010, p 36;

banks’ lending to domestic enterprises, Monthly Report, 
August 2010, p 35; and Deutsche Bundesbank, Fourth spe-
cial survey on German banks’ lending to domestic enter -
prises, Monthly Report, February 2011, p 33.
9 When aggregating the German responses, all German 
banks’ data are given the same weight. To obtain an ap -
proximately representative sample of the German banking 
sector as a whole, the share of the banks in the sample for each banking group is mapped to the banking group’s re-spective share in the German banking sector’s overall lend -
ing volume. The aggregated survey results for Germany may be found at http://www.bundesbank.de/Redaktion/
EN/Standardartikel/Tasks/Monetary_policy/volkswirtschaft_bank_lending_survey.html.10
 For supply-  r elated questions, the net percentages refer 
to the difference between the sum of the percentages for 
“tightened considerably” and “tightened somewhat” and 
the sum of the percentages for “eased somewhat” and “eased considerably”. Positive net percentages thus indi -
cate tightened standards, while negative values indicate a 
loosening. For demand-  r elated questions, the net percent -
ages refer to the difference between the sum of the per -
centages for “increased considerably” and “increased 
somewhat” and the sum of the percentages for “decreased somewhat” and “decreased considerably”. Positive net per -
centages thus indicate higher demand, while negative val-ues indicate lower demand. Not only net percentages but 
also averages across all banks’ responses and diffusion in -
dices are calculated; the latter are calculated much like net 
percentages, the difference being that the “somewhat” an -
swers are only given a weight of 0.5.Deutsche Bundesbank

horizon. Apart from slight changes in either di -
rection, credit standards have remained largely 
unchanged from mid-2009 to the present. 
Credit standards for loans to households were 
still being eased up until mid-2008 before then 
also being tightened in the course of the finan -
cial crisis. However, in the case of loans to households both for house purchase and for consumer credit and other lending, the tight -
ening was far less pronounced than in the case 
of loans to enterprises. For instance, overall 
credit standards for loans to households were 
tightened relatively moderately in the first years of the crisis; from spring 2011, they then under -
went only minor adjustments, although the standards for loans to households for house purchase continued to show a tendency to -
wards a slight tightening. This indicates that 
the minimum requirements for potential hous-
ing loan borrowers have not been eased during 
the real estate boom of the past few years. 
However, under the currently favourable eco-
nomic circumstances, it appears likely that 
more loan applicants are meeting banks’ un -
changed requirements.11 At last report, a con -
siderable tightening of standards for loans to 
households for house purchase was becoming 
apparent for the first time since the financial 
crisis.
The factors affecting the adjustments to banks’ 
credit standards changed as the financial and 
sovereign debt crisis unfolded. The loosening 
of credit standards for loans to enterprises in 
the first half of 2007 was still influenced by 
growing competition in the banking industry 
and optimism about the general economic situ-
ation and outlook as well as concerning the 
industry-  specific and firm-  specific situation.  
However, from the second half of 2007 on -
wards, following the initial financial market tur -
moil caused by the US subprime crisis, it began 
to appear that rising funding costs and balance-  
sheet constraints – in other words, bank-  r elated 
factors – were per se causing a perceptible 
tightening of credit standards. Once the finan -
cial crisis broke out in autumn 2008, assess -
ments of the risks to the real economy sud -denly worsened markedly; this was the key 
driver behind the sharp tightening of credit 
standards over this period. Both bank-  r elated 
factors and the assessment of macroeconomic 
risk caused standards for loans to large enter -
prises to be tightened considerably more se -
verely than standards for loans to small and 
medium-  sized enterprises (SMEs).12 The latter 
are likely to have been affected less strongly by 
the tightening primarily because smaller credit 
institutions, as the typical counterparties of 
SMEs, obtain their funding more from deposits 
than from the money and capital markets, which were hit particularly hard by the crisis, 
and were therefore less affected by rising fund -
ing costs than the large commercial banks. The 
monetary policy measures (long-  term r efinan -
cing operations, covered bond purchase pro -
gramme), too, helped to alleviate, and to even 
temporarily reverse, the tightening effect of 
bank-  r elated factors, especially the worsened 
funding terms and the liquidity position, al -
ready in 2009. Given the struggling real sector, 
however, the factors relating to lending risk continued to drive developments up to and 
into 2010, though their impact steadily dimin -
ished.
In keeping with the moderate changes regis -
tered in credit standards for loans to house -
holds in the first quarters of the crisis, the ef -
fects of the associated determinants were like -
wise small. The economic situation and outlook had a tightening impact on real estate business 
largely only in 2009 and on consumer credit – 
in connection with households’ creditworthi -
ness – from the second half of 2008 to mid-
2010. Given that credit standards changed very 
little from the end of 2009, none of the sur -
veyed factors subsequently led to a meaningful 
tightening lasting more than one quarter. Since Following onset

2008, however, both loan categories, taken in 
isolation, have repeatedly been loosened to 
some extent in the face of growing competitive 
pressure, especially from other institutions. The surveyed banks attributed the latest significant 
tightening of credit standards for household 
loans for house purchase in the first quarter of 
2016 to an exceptional factor: the entry into 
force on 21 March 2016 of the Act Implement -
ing the Mortgage Credit Directive and Amend-
ing Accounting Rules (Gesetz zur Umsetzung 
der Wohnimmobilienkreditrichtlinie und zur 
Änderung handelsrechtlicher Vorschriften).  This 
legislation considerably tightened credit assess -
ment standards.
In order to supplement the highlighted quar -
terly changes in credit standards with some 
kind of level measure, a stopgap solution was 
initially introduced in the form of cumulated 
changes in standards and margins. However, 
the prevailing level of credit standards at the 
turn of 2002-03 prior to the launch of the BLS 
was and remains unknown for the purposes of 
this study.13 Moreover, this method of cumula -
tion also contains conceptual deficiencies. For 
instance, the cumulation should be measured 
against a benchmark with a “neutral” level 
which, however, it is impossible to identify.14
Because of these shortcomings, an ad hoc  
question was introduced in 2014 in which the 
surveyed senior bank executives were asked 
directly, and separately for each loan category, 
how restrictive or expansive they considered 
their current credit standards to be compared 
with two reference periods, one from the 
launch of the BLS in 2003 up to the present 
and the other from the escalation of the sover -
eign debt crisis in the second quarter of 2010 
up to the present. Each bank was to use as its 
reference level the midpoint of the range of its 
responses, ie the midpoint of the range be -
tween the tightest and loosest level of its credit 
standards in the respective periods.15
The fact that credit standards have remained 
nearly constant in all loan categories in the past few years should be weighed against the fact 
that they were tightened earlier, in some cases 
considerably, during the financial crisis. Much like the cumulative changes in standards, the Cumulative

13 It is not even possible to say whether that level was 
tight or loose by historical standards. Nor is it appropriate 
to make any comparison between individual banks or loan 
segments since it cannot be assumed that the respective 
starting levels were identical. The same goes for a compari -
son of country aggregates.

see Deutsche Bundesbank, The level of credit standards in 
the Bank Lending Survey, Monthly Report, August 2014, 
pp 44-45.
15 The banks were given eight possible answers to ap -
praise the current level of their credit standards compared with the reference level. In addition to the five gradations 
(from “considerably tighter than the midpoint of the range” 
to “considerably looser than the midpoint of the range”) 
modelled on the standard BLS questions, three further pos -
sible responses were provided which were designed to 
capture particularly noteworthy levels (“at the tightest/loos-
est level during this period”) or developments (“levels have 
remained constant during this period”). The responses 
were aggregated as net percentages, defined as the differ -
ence between the sum of the percentages of banks report -
ing a relatively tight level and the sum of the percentages 
of banks reporting a relatively loose level. See Deutsche

responses to the ad hoc  question concerning 
the current level of credit standards appear to 
indicate that standards in all credit segments 
are currently considerably tighter than their ref -
erence level since 2003. Compared with the 
shorter reference period since the second quar -
ter of 2010, however, credit standards are, 
overall, currently at a level which is comparable 
to the reference value.16 Standards for loans to 
households for house purchase, which are cur -
rently somewhat tighter than their reference value since 2010, are an exception. Both the 
responses to this ad hoc  question and the as -
certained cumulative changes in standards ap -
pear to indicate that the range of credit stand -
ards in all business areas has narrowed since the intensification of the sovereign debt crisis 
and shifted towards a tightening of standards.Credit terms and conditions 
Credit terms and conditions comprise margins 
(reported separately for average and riskier 
loans) and “other conditions and terms”, which 
include the following: non-  inter est rate charges, 
size of the loan or credit line, collateral require -
ments, maturity and covenants (for loans to en -
terprises) or the loan-  to-  value r atio (for loans to 
households for house purchase). The respond -
ent senior bank executives began to report on overall terms and conditions in 2015.
In 2007, German banks were, on balance, nar -
rowing their margins, in some cases sharply, on 
average loans in all three business areas; a sub-sequent increase in risk perception brought on by the financial crisis prompted a considerable 
widening of margins in business lending. This 
affected both average and riskier loans, which 
means that banks were being cautious not only 
concerning the provision of funds for riskier 
projects or to start-  up fi rms but also with re -
gard to the funding of standard projects. By 
contrast, margin adjustments in loans to house -
holds remained limited in the crisis period be -
ginning in 2008. From 2010, margins were re -
peatedly narrowed moderately in this segment, 
in some cases even for riskier loans. On the 
other hand, a protracted period of narrowing 
margins in loans to enterprises did not begin 
until 2014. These latest customer-  friend ly Credit standards

period), even if the results are consistent for each individual 
bank. A seemingly implausible constellation might be im -
plied, for example, by the following simplified example. 
Bank 1 reports its credit standards for loans to large enter -
prises and to enterprises overall as “unchanged”, but its standards for loans to SMEs (of smaller volume and thus 
less important for the bank) as “tightened”; bank 2 reports 
its standards for loans to large enterprises and to enter -
prises overall as “eased” but its standards for loans to SMEs 
(less important for the bank) as “unchanged”; bank 3 re -
ports its standards for loans to SMEs and enterprises overall as “unchanged” but its standards for loans to large enter -
prises (less important for the bank) as “tightened”. Aggre-
gated across all three banks, this yields net changes in 
credit standards of -33 (“eased”) for overall loans to enter -

+33 (“tightened”) for loans to SMEs.Deutsche Bundesbank

Estimating aggregate credit supply shocks for Germany 
using BLS data
In order to analyse the effects of potential 
supply- side constraints on credit growth it is 
necessary to determine pure, ie exogenous, 
changes in the credit supply. The Bank Lending Survey (BLS) is generally a good 
data source for identifying such credit sup-
ply shocks as banks are routinely asked 
about their lending policy in the form of ad-
justments to their credit standards. How-ever, changes in credit standards cannot 
automatically be interpreted as exogenous 
credit supply shocks as they may also be 
subject to other determinants.
For example, there might be a direct link between credit standards and credit de-
mand, eg if banks adjust their standards in order to stabilise their market share by off-setting fl  uctuations in credit demand.
Moreover, changes in credit standards and 
credit demand may be attributable to com-mon factors.
– 
A changing macroeconomic situation 
may be expected to trigger an adjust-
ment in both credit standards and credit demand.
1
– Bank- specifi  c variables that may play a 
role in determining a bank’s credit stand-
ards may likewise depend on determin-
ants that simultaneously impact credit 
demand. Thus an economic downswing 
that causes the number of non- performing loans to increase may well encourage banks to tighten their credit 
standards so as to maintain the value of their loan portfolio. At the same time, an 
economic downswing could also lower 
credit demand if fi  rms invest less owing 
to poorer sales prospects and thus bor-
row less.To identify exogenous changes in credit standards, ie those that occur independ-ently of other variables, the changes in 
credit standards reported by the banks must 
therefore be adjusted for other factors be-
sides the direct impact of changes in credit demand. It is necessary to additionally cap-
ture all determinants that both infl  uence credit standards and either directly affect demand or may themselves be infl  uenced 
by variables that lead to a change in credit demand.
In a fi  rst step – based on the method ap-
plied by Bassett et al (2014)2 – the impact of 
a number of variables on changes in credit 
standards is estimated using a dynamic 
fi  xed- effects panel model for the banks in-
cluded in the German BLS sample, aggre-
gated into banking groups.3

consumer confi  dence, which is one of the factors in 
the BLS affecting household demand.

The idea underlying this approach is to ad-
just the changes in the credit standards as 
derived from the BLS fi  ndings for the im-
pact of the right- hand variables. This isol-
ates the share of the change in credit stand-
ards which is not explained by the right- 
hand variables and can, therefore, be inter-preted as a proxy for exogenous changes in 
the credit supply (ie pure credit supply 
shock) at banking group level. A crucial re-
quirement of this empirical identifi  cation strategy is to capture not just credit de-mand but all other conceivable determin-
ants of credit standards that either directly 
change credit demand or are infl  uenced by other factors that also affect credit demand.
Given this requirement, vector mt in equa-
tion (1) comprises real GDP (in logarithmic 
form), the unemployment rate, the three- 
month money market rate (Euribor) and the yield on German government bonds with a 
residual maturity of ten years. The calcula-
tion of expectations Et–1 formed in period 
t–1 regarding the change in the variables 
included in mt over the period t to t+4 was 
partly based on the expectations gauged by the Consensus Forecast. Vector n
t contains 
real GDP (in logarithmic form) and the un-
employment rate; vector ft comprises the 
overnight money market rate (Eonia) and the volatility index (VDAX), which gauges the volatility of the German share price 
index (DAX).5
The choice of banking group- specifi  c vari-ables is based, fi  rst, on the determinants mentioned in the literature. Berger and 
Udell (2004),6 for example, demonstrate an 
empirical relationship between the changes 
in loan loss provisions and the associated 
change in profi  tability and credit standards. 
In addition, Gatev and Strahan (2006)7 as 
well as Pennacchi (2006)8 show that banks’ 
lending policy depends on their access to 
stable funding sources. Hence the banking 
group- specifi  c control variables Yi,t–1, be-
sides net interest income as a measure of 
profi  tability, contain write- downs and value adjustments on claims and certain securities 
and also transfers to loan loss provisions 
4 In order to determine the banking group- specifi  c net 
percentage of the changes in credit standards, ∆ Si,t, 
(demand, ∆Di,t) the net percentage of the changes in 
credit standards (changes in demand) were fi  rst com-
puted for each banking group i and at each point in 
time t in the three loan categories (loans to enter-
prises, loans to households for house purchase, con-
sumer credit and other lending to households) polled 
by the BLS. The weighted average of the banking 
group- specifi  c net percentages of all three loan cat-
egories were then calculated for each banking group i and each point in time t, weighted by the share of the 
respective loan category in banking group i ’s total 
loans to the non- fi  nancial private sector at time t–1.
5 Changes in Eonia or the VDAX are included in the 
model in order to control for changes in the expansive-ness of monetary policy and perceived uncertainty re-
garding the economic situation in the context of ad-
justments of credit standards. It is conceivable that the 
changes in Eonia may not adequately refl  ect some of 
the non- standard monetary policy measures taken in 
adjusting the expansiveness of monetary policy. How-ever, the BLS fi  ndings show that the German banks did not adjust their credit standards owing to TLTROs and 
the EAPP . The model disregards potential effects of other non- standard measures which cannot be ad-
equately approximated by changes in Eonia.

(both in relation to total assets). Access to 
stable funding sources is proxied in the vec-
tor of banking group- specifi  c control vari-
ables Zi,t–1 by the ratio of deposits to loans.
Second, the banking group- specifi  c control 
variables contain additional determinants 
that are assumed to infl  uence credit stand-
ards. It follows that various standard- setting 
behaviours are conceivable depending on 
the relative signifi  cance of a bank’s lending business. Banks that are strongly reliant on 
lending business are likely to have tighter standards than competitors with business models which are less focused on lending and, therefore, better equipped to offset potential losses in their loan portfolio. 
Moreover, credit standards could also be in-fl  uenced by the size of a bank measured in 
terms of total assets, eg if smaller banks 
cannot grant larger loans, or can do so only on a limited scale, as they cannot draw on the compensatory synergies of an affi   liated network of banks. In order to capture both 
effects in the model, the control variables 
Zi,t–1 therefore additionally contain loans to 
the private non- fi  nancial sector (in relation 
to total assets) and total assets (in logarith-mic form).
Assuming that endogenous changes in the 
credit standards can be fully captured by 
the right- hand variables in equation (1), the 
residuals εi,t refl  ect the exogenous part of 
the changes in credit standards, ie the credit 
supply shocks of banking group i.9 Possible 
reasons for movements in these variables are changes in prudential and regulatory 
rules, changes in the business strategy or a 
fundamental revaluation of lending- related 
risks where this does not entail any change 
in credit demand. Positive (negative) re-
sidual values represent an exogenous tight-
ening (easing) of credit standards at the 
banking group level.

group- specifi  c exogenous changes in credit standards ^εi,t, are aggregated to form

changes, Sadj

Like the interpretation of the banking group- specifi  c residuals ε

proxy of exogenous adjustments of lending 
policy at the level of the German banking system resulting from purely bank- related 
factors. Hence these are referred to below 
as aggregate credit supply shocks.
In contrast to the aggregate credit supply shocks, the (unadjusted) changes in BLS credit standards refl  ect changes in stand-ards which may additionally result from banks’ response to changes in demand or changes in the macroeconomic environ-
ment and bank- specifi  c variables.

three loan categories specifi  ed in the BLS.10 
The two charts basically show a fundamen-
tally similar pattern aside from the smaller 
persistence in the upper time series owing 
to the inclusion of the lagged changes in 
credit standards in equation (1).
What is striking is that there are two periods 
which contain both the positive and nega-
tive extreme values and during which the 
development of the two time series di-verges. Furthermore, the path of the esti-
mated aggregate credit supply shocks dur-
ing these two periods is robust to different 
model specifi  cations in which individual 
variables were removed from the model es-timated here. In the fi  rst phase from the be-
ginning of 2006 to the third quarter of 2007, the unadjusted changes in credit 
standards were consistently in negative ter-ritory; in other words: the German banks on 
balance continuously eased their credit standards. Yet, given that the aggregate 
credit supply shocks in the fi  rst half of this period fl  uctuated around the zero bound, the easing in this phase was most likely a response of the banks to changes in the 
variables used in the model, ie they mainly 
refl  ect endogenous changes in the stand-ards. Only at the beginning of 2007 did banks begin to ease their credit standards 
also exogenously, which is consistent with 
the extremely negative supply shock at that time.
The second phase began with the collapse 
of Lehman Brothers in the third quarter of 
2008, stretching into the third quarter of 2009. In accordance with the path of the unadjusted changes in standards, banks 
continuously tightened their standards dur-ing this period. However, the tighter stand-
ards were accompanied by an appreciable exogenous restrictive adjustment of the 
standards only at the start of the period as 
the estimated time series of aggregate credit supply shocks exhibits a perceptibly 
positive value only at the beginning of the 
second period. According to the estimated 
model, the subsequent tightening of credit standards reported by banks was, however, 
primarily a response by the banks to 
changes in demand, changes in the realised 
and expected macroeconomic setting and to related changes in bank- specifi  c vari-
ables.
10 The net percentage of unadjusted changes in credit 
standards for the German banking system was calcu-
lated as an average across the three loan categories 
surveyed in the BLS, each weighted by its share in total 
lending to the non- fi  nancial private sector by the bank-ing groups participating in the BLS.Estimated aggregate credit supply shocks and unadjusted changes in standards

changes appear to have been triggered by, 
above all, the highly competitive environment 
which banks are facing, as diagnosed by the 
responses to the questions on the factors 
 affecting margin adjustments, which were 
introduced in 2015. The evolution of the other 
surveyed terms and conditions in loans to en -
terprises largely mirrored the evolution of mar -
gins, whereas for loans to households these 
terms and conditions were barely adjusted 
after the end of 2007.
Evolution of demand  
for bank lending
According to BLS data, demand for bank lend -
ing on the part of non-  financial corpor ations17 
rose – with the exception of a very few quar -
ters – more or less continuously between 2007 
and mid-2011, though it should be noted that 
the measured demand includes queries and ap -
plications that ultimately did not result in a 
loan.18 This demand pattern slowed only in the 
second half of 2011 before reversing in the fol-
lowing two years. In 2014 demand then slowly 
picked up again, rising considerably of late.
Households’ financing needs for house pur -
chase and consumption displayed considerably 
divergent paths. Thus their demand for mort -
gage loans dropped significantly in 2007 and 
2008 before establishing a still persisting trend 
of marked to steep rising demand, punctured 
only rarely by brief stagnant spells. Households’ borrowing for consumption has risen distinctly 
on average over all quarters since 2007. The 
percentage of rejected loan applications, which 
has featured in the survey since the beginning of 2015, has tended since then to drop some -
what in all three lending segments.
Much like the determinants of credit standards, 
the factors affecting demand have also 
changed over the course of the financial and 
sovereign debt crisis. When interpreting these 
findings, however, it should be borne in mind 
that, while the respondents can report confi -dently on the determinants of credit standards, because they are themselves involved in the ad -
justment process, their statements on the 
drivers of demand are less robust because loan 
officers can only indirectly second-  guess bor -Continuing trend

17 It was not until the revised version of the BLS came out 
that demand was uniformly defined as nominal gross de -
mand relative to the previous quarter. It relates to firms’ and 
households’ request for bank funding, regardless of 
whether a loan is actually granted. See the box on pp 17-19.
18 For example, simultaneous loan requests addressed to 
multiple BLS institutions for the sake of caution can mas -
sively inflate BLS demand. In addition, the increase in loan demand as reported by the BLS may also mask shifts within the market towards smaller institutions that were less hard 
hit by the financial crisis, but which show little impact on 
the aggregate loan demand as captured by the monthly 
balance sheet statistics.Deutsche Bundesbank

rowers’ motives. In corporate lending business, 
the change in firms’ funding demand for fixed 
investment reflects both the onset of the finan -
cial crisis and the gradual easing thereafter. 
Thus demand for fixed investment was rising, 
in some cases massively, in 2007 and the first 
half of 2008, but then slumped; this was fol -
lowed from mid-2010 until the first quarter of 
2012 by a renewed phase in which fixed invest -
ment impacted positively on funding needs. No 
clear trend was evident for a long time there -
after, but demand for funding for this purpose 
has recently picked up again. Funding needs 
for inventories and working capital responded 
with a time-  lag. They exerted a positive impact 
on demand – probably due to sagging sales during the crisis – into the third quarter of 2011, before dampening effects subsequently 
regained the upper hand. In the 2008 to 2012 
crisis period, funding needs for mergers/acqui-
sitions and corporate restructuring likewise de -
creased, whereas demand for debt refinancing/
restructuring and renegotiation rose.
One of the relevant factors behind the recent 
considerable rise in demand has been the low 
general level of interest rates, the impact of 
which has been surveyed by the BLS since early 2015. Another consequence of the interest rate 
cuts is that, from around mid-2010 to the 
present, demand for long-  term loans has in -
creasingly supplanted that for short-  term loans.
As regards alternative sources of finance, de -
mand for loans from BLS banks was, on the 
one hand, bolstered in the first crisis years from 
mid-2008 to the end of 2010 in the view of the 
BLS respondents by the simultaneous request -
ing of loans from multiple institutions to fore -
stall possible rejections by some banks. On the 
other hand, demand for bank lending was 
dampened long term after the crisis peaked by 
a substitution effect as firms resorted more to 
internal financing or issuance of debt secur -
ities.19
Uncertainty following the financial crisis, re -
flected in a decline in consumer confidence and a gloomier outlook for the real estate mar -
ket, dented demand for loans to households 
for house purchase only from the fourth quar -
ter of 2007 to the end of 2008. According to 
information provided by some BLS banks, gen -
eral uncertainty, coupled with a lack of attract-
ive alternative investment options, then com -
bined to drive up demand for loans for house 
purchase since households have tended mainly 
for these reasons to shift their wealth into tan-
gible assets. The steep interest rate cuts at the end of 2008, too, help to explain why demand 
for bank lending in this segment not only re -
covered quickly but also entered into a lengthy 
period of unparalleled demand growth which 
has persisted up to the present. Therefore, the “General level of interest rates” has been iden -
tified as the most important factor in the survey 
since its introduction in 2015. The dampening 
effects of other factors were limited. These in-
clude (partial) financing out of households’ sav -
ings and loans from other banks. Among the 
determinants of demand for consumer credit, 
the picture is similar. Propensity to purchase did 
not slump during the crisis; according to BLS 
data, its momentum was supported by the 
“environmental premium” for buying a new 
car, which was introduced in 2009. Similarly, 
consumer confidence dipped only in 2008. 
Subsequently, up until today, these two factors 
– alongside the low general level of interest 
rates – have been the main drivers of rising de -
mand. As with the demand for loans to house -
holds for house purchase, household savings 
and loans from other banks tended to have a 
dampening effect on demand for consumer 
credit and other lending at BLS banks.Low general

Credit supply and demand 
trends in Germany and the euro area
In the wake of the financial and economic cri -
sis, BLS banks in the euro area (including Ger-
many) tightened their lending policy not only 
to a significantly greater extent overall than the 
German institutions, but also over a longer 
period. This is especially true of the periphery 
countries. From mid-2007 to mid-2009, euro-  
area banks tightened their credit standards in 
all business lines, in some cases massively, prin -
cipally owing to their assessment of the inher -
ent risk of lending, although bank-  r elated fac -
tors also played a part in this. At the same time, 
euro-  ar ea banks widened their margins – in 
some cases dramatically – and concurrently 
tightened their other terms and conditions. In 
the period from 2011 to 2013, euro-  ar ea banks 
(largely excepting Germany) made further re -
strictive adjustments, chiefly for reasons relat -ing to the real economy, although some were 
bank-  r elated. Conversely, the recent easing of 
standards and margins since the end of 2014 
has been more marked in other euro-  ar ea 
countries than in Germany. The surveyed insti -
tutions attributed these adjustments primarily 
to increasing competition in the banking sec -
tor.
While periods of contracting credit demand 
since 2007 were relatively short in Germany (in 
the case of loans to enterprises mainly in 2012-
13 and in the case of loans for house purchase 
in 2007-08) and the declines were relatively 
moderate, there were marked to dramatic 
slumps in demand in other euro-  ar ea countries, 
especially in the field of real estate financing. In 
2008, for example, nearly all the surveyed 
banks in Spain and Ireland – countries that 
were particularly affected by the real estate cri-
sis – reported falls in demand. Demand for 
loans to enterprises dipped chiefly because of a 
declining need for funds for fixed investment, 
mergers, acquisitions and corporate restructur -
ing. Household demand deteriorated mainly in 
response to a gloomier housing market out -
look, including house price developments, coupled with sagging consumer confidence 
and a falling propensity to purchase consumer 
durables. These factors only started to support 
households’ credit demand again when macro -
economic momentum began to pick up in 
2014. This was accompanied by strengthening 
demand for loans to enterprises. This was re -
flected first in a rising need for inventories and 
working capital, for corporate restructuring 
and for refinancing. Since 2015, there has also 
been increased demand for funding fixed in -
vestment. Low interest rates were cited as the 
main driver of demand in all credit segments, 
however. This positive growth momentum has persisted up to the present time.Massive tighten-

Ad hoc questions on the 
 impact of the financial crisis 
on funding conditions and 
lending policy
As early as autumn 2007, the BLS responded to 
the emerging turbulence in the financial mar -
kets, triggered by the crisis in US subprime 
mortgage-  r elated bonds and its spillover into 
the markets for structured credit products, by 
introducing new ad hoc  questions in the sur -
vey. In the October 2007 round and in the fol-
lowing quarters, senior bank executives were 
asked what effect the current situation in the 
financial markets, taken in isolation, was hav -
ing on their banks’ credit standards. The Ger -
man respondent banks, on the whole, initially 
reported only moderately tightening effects on 
their standards for loans to enterprises, whereas 
in the rest of the euro area the turbulence was 
placing a significantly greater strain on lending 
to large firms, in particular. In 2008, the survey 
contained an additional question, which was 
repeated for several quarters, on the extent to 
which banks’ lending and margins had been 
affected   by funding commitments to pr o-
grammes issued by conduits or structured in-
vestment vehicles (SIVs).20 The answers showed 
that the negative effects of such commitments 
at German banks were greater than those in 
the euro area as a whole, although barely more 
than one-  quarter of the surveyed banks wer e 
affected at all.
Since the third quarter of 2007, banks have 
been asked to provide information on the ex -
tent to which the situation in the financial mar -
ket is affecting their access to wholesale fund-ing via their normal financing channels.
21 In the 
first years of the crisis, it was evident that the 
turbulence was exerting a considerable nega -
tive impact on wholesale funding both in Ger -
many and the euro area as a whole. At the end of 2008, for instance, 60% of the German BLS 
banks with access to the unsecured interbank 
money market (over one week) described ac -
cess as considerably hampered or somewhat hampered. In the euro area as a whole, this was stated by more than three-  quarters of  
banks that customarily obtain funding from this 
source. The hurdles to refinancing via debt se -
curities were similarly high. In both the German 
and euro-  ar ea-  wide sample in the final quarter 
of 2008, more than 70% of BLS banks obtain-
ing their funding through wholesale debt se-
curities issuance reported that market access was hampered considerably or somewhat 
hampered. In some cases, the possibility of se -
curitising loans came to a complete standstill, 
although only a minority of banks were using 
this as a source of funding. According to the 
information provided by the surveyed banks re-
porting difficulties in market access, this some -
times had a considerable impact on lending 
volumes and margins in the initial crisis years both in Germany and in the euro area as a 
whole.
After their funding situation had eased some -
what at the end of 2009 as a result of the Eu -
rosystem’s massive easing measures, this ad 
hoc question was reworded to ask respondents 
whether the situation in the financial markets 
had led to an improvement or deterioration in 
market access compared with the previous 
quarter, rather than the extent to which access 
had been hampered. Apart from the second 
quarter of 2010, when the sovereign debt crisis 
started to escalate, and the second half of 
2011, when it spiralled further amid substantial 
uncertainty in the financial markets, the situ -
ation with regard to all sources of funding has First ad hoc

on underlying claims, such as asset-  backed securities (ABSs) 
or collateralised debt obligations (CDOs), which are refi -
nanced by the issuance of shorter-  term commer cial paper. 
The subprime crisis in the United States and the sudden 
illiquidity   of many col lateralised securities posed a threat to 
the existence of some banks, as they were no longer able to refinance their purchased receivables in the money mar -
ket.
21 Questions were asked about the following credit cat -
egories: unsecured interbank money market (very short-  
term money market up to one week, short-  t erm money 
market over one week), wholesale debt securities (short-  
term as well as medium to long-  term debt securities), se -

purchase), and the ability to transfer credit risk off the bal-ance sheet.Deutsche Bundesbank

been easing almost constantly in Germany 
since 2010, especially with regard to medium 
and long-  term debt securities and securitisa -
tion. The conditions for funding via deposits22 
also showed an overall improvement, although 
the significant easing in the case of short-  term 
deposits has been accompanied by a slight de -
terioration in longer-  term deposits. This is likely 
to be due essentially to the declining interest 
rate spread between these two categories and 
thus to the lower opportunity cost of holding 
money, which has resulted in shifts from longer-  
term deposit components into short-  term ones. 
The latter development is also true of the euro 
area as a whole. By contrast, it was only in the 
second half of 2012 that a sustained slight eas -
ing began in the money market and in debt 
securities against the backdrop of the monet -
ary policy measures adopted from the end of 
2011, comprising the launch of a new covered 
bond purchase programme and the introduc -
tion of three-  year r efinancing operations. Since 
that time, however, there have also been recur -rent perceptible difficulties in some countries 
with regard to funding via the money market 
or debt securities, which have also been re -
flected in cases of intermittently stagnant de -
velopment throughout the euro area.
The announcement and introduction of gov -
ernment measures to support recapitalisation 
and provide state guarantees for bank debt se -
curities in the wake of the escalating financial 
market crisis in the autumn of 2008 were the 
starting point for an ad hoc  question on spe -
cific positive effects on banks’ market access. 
While fewer than 20% of BLS banks in Ger -
many reported a slightly or considerably posi -
tive impact on access to wholesale funding in 
2009, the figure for the euro area as a whole 
was, at times, more than 50%.23
In the wake of the financial crisis spillover into 
the European sovereign bond markets, a ques -
tion on the specific impact of the sovereign 
debt crisis on banks’ funding conditions and 
lending policies was included between the 
fourth quarter of 2011 and the third quarter of 
2014. The results for Germany showed the sov -
ereign debt crisis had no more than slight and 
mostly positive effects on banks’ funding con -
ditions overall, with standards and margins not 
being affected at all. This stood in contrast to 
the rest of the euro area, where banks, espe -
cially in the periphery countries, reported at the 
end of 2011 that their funding situation had 
been considerably hampered by the sovereign 
debt crisis. This was making itself felt in terms 
of both direct exposures and the collateral 
value of government bonds on the repo mar -Ad hoc question

banks’ access to wholesale funding via their customary

ket, as well as through other effects.24 All three 
channels were leading per se to a considerable 
tightening of credit standards. The subsequent 
marked recovery in the European sovereign 
bond markets in the light of the new purchase 
programme for government bonds announced 
by the ECB Governing Council in September 2012 (outright monetary transactions, OMTs) 
then began to lead, from the fourth quarter, to 
a gradual easing of the impact on banks’ 
wholesale funding.
Ad hoc questions on 
 regulatory measures in 
 response to the financial 
market crisis
A specific question about the impact of events 
in the financial markets on the capital position 
and their potential implications for lending was 
initially introduced as long as ago as in the Oc -
tober 2007 survey round and was included in 
the quarterly survey in the following years. 
Roughly half of the German banks participating 
in the BLS stated that the initial turbulence and 
the ensuing crisis had an impact on their capital 
position, with many of them tightening their 
credit standards as a result. In the sample for 
the euro area as a whole, an even higher per -
centage of banks experienced a negative im -
pact on their capital position and lending, and 
this situation persisted for the most part up to 
at least 2010. In 2011, this question was re -
placed by a series of questions, which appear 
at a half-  yearly fr equency in the questionnaire, 
relating to the impact of ongoing changes in 
regulatory and supervisory requirements under 
Basel  III25 on the banks’ risk-  weighted assets,  
capital position, funding conditions and lend -
ing. In every single half-  year since this gr oup of 
questions was introduced, the German BLS 
banks have reported that the new regulations 
have led to a substantial strengthening of their 
capital position in comparison with each pre -
ceding six-  month period. Very marked im -
provements were apparent in the first half of 
the respective year, as the instrument of profit retention was then available. Especially in the 
period from the second half of 2011 to the end 
of 2013, this development was accompanied 
by a significant reduction in risk-  weighted  
assets, partly by downsizing the stock of riskier 
loans. In attenuated form, this development 
has been continuing right up to the present, 
albeit accompanied of late by an increase in 
the volume of average loans.
The surveyed banks in the euro area as a whole 
have likewise been steadily improving their 
capital position since the group of questions re-
lating to the new regulatory and supervisory 
requirements was introduced at the beginning 
of 2011. Compared with the results for Ger -
many, retention of profits was a less significant 
factor, however, while the issuance of capital 
instruments played a somewhat more import -
ant role. In order to reduce their risk-  weighted 
assets, banks in the euro area cut back their 
stocks of both riskier and average loans in 
2012-13. Funding conditions in Germany and in 
the euro area as a whole were essentially un -
affected by the new regulatory and prudential 
requirements under Basel  II I. For the surveyed 
institutions, these regulations sometimes led to 
a tightening impact on credit standards for 
loans to enterprises and loans for house pur -
chase, however, which was stronger in the 
euro area overall than in Germany, while mar -
gins, too, were distinctly widened in this con -
nection in 2012-13.Capital position

downgrade or changes in the value of the domestic gov -
ernment’s implicit guarantee, as well as spillover effects on

25 The new regulations include, first, the prudential re -
quirements enshrined in CRR/CRD  IV . Second, banks need 
to take account of the capital requirements arising from 
the comprehensive assessment, which is carried out by the

Ad hoc  questions on non-  
standard monetary policy 
measures
Ad hoc  questions relating to some of the non-  
standard monetary policy measures adopted 
during the financial crisis were also incorpor -
ated into the BLS. Since the introduction of 
targeted   l onger-  t erm refinancing operations 
(TLTROs) in the autumn of 2014, the question -
naire has asked a series of questions at half-  
 yearly frequency on this subject, asking whether 
banks participated in recent TLTROs or intend 
to participate in future TLTROs and requesting 
an explanation of the main reason behind their 
decisions, as well as a question on the pur -
poses for which the funds obtained are used 
and the potential impact on the banks’ finan -
cial situation, credit standards and terms and 
conditions. Since the first quarter of 2015, al -
ternating with this series of questions, the par -
ticipating institutions have been asked at half-  yearly frequency about the impact of the Euro-
system’s expanded asset purchase programme 
(EAPP) on their financial situation and lending 
policy as well as the purpose for which the 
additional liquidity is used. The negative de -
posit facility rate occasioned the introduction 
of a further ad hoc question in the April 2016 round. This asks the banks about its effects on 
their net interest income, lending rates and 
margins.
Targeted longer-  term 
 refinancing operations
In June 2014, the Governing Council of the ECB 
decided to launch a series of eight targeted 
longer-  term r efinancing operations (TLTROs) 
against the backdrop of continued weak bank 
lending. The partial coupling of such oper -
ations to banks’ current level of lending to the 
private sector was designed to incentivise 
banks to make additional loans to the private 
sector over and above their existing loan port -
folio.26 This could not, however, preclude insti-
tutions from using part of the central bank 
loans in order to replace maturing market 
funds or to purchase interest-  bearing securities.
Up to the January 2016 survey round, the Ger -
man banks participating in the BLS showed 
only moderate interest on the whole in the 
TLTROs   conducted since September 2 014. The 
institutions took part only in isolated cases and 
the number of those definitely intending to 
borrow funds in future TLTROs was very limited. 
In the euro area as a whole, by contrast, the percentage of institutions participating in the 
operations – roughly half of the responding 
BLS banks each time – was initially much higher 
than in Germany, although, in December 2015, 
the relevant euro-  ar ea figure was only just over 
one- fifth of the institutions participating in the 
survey. According to the banks’ responses,

to participate, ie their interest in the TLTROs 
was due primarily to the scheme’s attractive 
conditions. For some institutions, the driving 
factor was being better able to meet regulatory 
liquidity requirements or reducing current and/
or preventing future funding constraints. The 
other banks stated that the reason for their 
non- participation was due almost exclusively to 
not experiencing any difficulties in funding. The 
banks that took part in one or more of the six 
TLTROs up to December 2015 reported that 
they had used the funds chiefly for lending to 
firms and households in line with the measure’s 
intended monetary policy purpose, although some of the surveyed banks stated that they 
also used their funds for substituting other funding sources. Unlike the German banks, which mainly wished to substitute maturing debt, the banks in the rest of the euro area, 
however, were primarily intending to substitute 
TLTRO funds for other liquidity-  pr oviding Euro -
system instruments. According to information 
supplied by the surveyed banks, the TLTROs 
carried out so far have brought about an over -
all improvement in their financial situation. 
Banks in the euro area as a whole cited, above 
all, a strengthening of their liquidity position. In 
addition, both the participating German institu-
tions and the banks in other euro-  ar ea coun -
tries reported a positive impact on their profit -
ability, as the preferential conditions of the 
TLTROs   had an easing impact on the cost side. 
They also reported that their market funding 
conditions had improved somewhat as a result 
of the TLTROs.27 According to the German 
banks, participation had no impact on their 
lending policy. The institutions involved in the 
euro-  ar ea-  wide sample likewise r eported that 
their participation had not affected their credit 
standards, although their concrete lending 
terms, especially for loans to enterprises, had 
been eased considerably in some cases.Eurosystem expanded asset 
purchase programme
On 22 January 2015, the Governing Council of 
the ECB announced an expanded asset pur -
chase programme (EAPP) encompassing not 
only a continuation of the existing programmes 
for purchasing covered bonds and asset-  backed 
securities, but also the intention to buy, under 
certain conditions, bonds issued by euro-  ar ea 
central governments, agencies and European 
institutions.28 Given weaker-  t han- e xpected in -
flation dynamics and heightened risks of a pro -
longed period of low inflation, the majority of EAPP aimed at securing price stabilityPurposes* for which the funds obtained 
through targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) have been used to date

27 One relevant factor is that, owing to the longer-  term  
nature   of the TL TRO refinancing operations, the liquidity 
risk of the participating banks can be lowered over an ex-
tended period of time. Moreover, improved profitability owing to participation in the TLTROs may lead to more 
favourable   conditions when borrowing in the market.

the Governing Council members regarded the 
expanded asset purchase programme as being 
necessary to fulfil the Eurosystem’s price stabil-
ity mandate.
When asked about the direct or indirect impact 
of the EAPP on their financial situation, the BLS 
institutions in Germany and the euro area as a 
whole reported on balance that the pro-
gramme had led per se to a moderate disposal 
of euro-  ar ea government bonds. According to 
the banks’ information, the EAPP had improved 
both their liquidity position and their funding conditions, especially with regard to covered 
bonds, leading to the expectation of further improvements also for the six months follow -
ing the April 2016 survey round. For the Ger -
man BLS respondents the improvement in the 
liquidity position was almost exclusively the outcome of customers’ portfolio shifts into 
bank deposits and not due to the banks’ own 
sales of securities. In the euro-  ar ea sample, 
however, banks’ own asset sales also played a 
noticeable role, as it was evidently possible to 
generate profits with this in some countries. 
Substituting alternative funding sources as well 
as lending were cited as the intended use of 
the additional liquidity   in both survey samples. 
The EAPP had only a minor direct or indirect 
impact on the banks’ capital position. Since the introduction of this ad hoc question, most Ger -
man banks taking part in the survey have also 
reported that the expanded asset purchase 
programme has been squeezing their net inter -
est margins and thus denting their profitability. 
In the euro area as a whole, the surveyed banks 
reported in the first two survey rounds in spring 
and autumn 2015 that the EAPP was having a 
neutral net impact on their profitability owing 
to capital gains from own asset sales. Since, 
however, banks in other countries as well have 
meanwhile discerned a negative impact of the 
EAPP on their profitability, primarily owing to 
lower net interest margins, the aggregated sur -
vey results for the euro area as a whole, too, 
have likewise been reflecting this recently. Only 
banks in periphery countries were still reporting 
that the EAPP was having a neutral or positive 
impact on their profitability. For the six months 
after April 2016, the surveyed banks in the euro 
area as a whole are anticipating a further nega -
tive impact on profitability. Banks stated that 
the programme was having no significant im -
pact on credit standards and that it was un -
likely to have any effect on them in future 
either  . Nevertheless, cr edit standards in the 
euro area as a whole, both for loans to enter -
prises and in business with households, were 
eased considerably, and further easing is ex -
pected in the following six months.Liquidity position

Impact of the negative deposit 
facility rate
At its meeting on 5 June 2014, the Governing 
Council of the ECB decided to cut the interest 
rate on the deposit facility to -0.10%, thus 
bringing it into negative territory for the first 
time. From the end of 2014, this measure was 
followed by three further interest rate cuts to 
-0.40% at present. The newly introduced ad 
hoc question in the April 2016 survey round 
asks about the impact of the negative deposit 
facility rate on banks’ net interest income as 
well as lending rates, loan margins, non-  inter-
est rate charges and the lending volume in the 
three different loan categories. Banks were 
asked to consider both direct and indirect ef -
fects that might occur, even if the bank in 
question does not possess surplus liquidity.
According to the information provided by the 
surveyed banks in Germany as well as in the 
rest of the euro area and in nearly every mem -
ber state, the negative deposit facility rate had 
contributed considerably to a decline in their 
net interest income over the past six months. 
More than 80% of the BLS banks in both sam -
ples cited slight or considerable negative ef -
fects. In line with the usual interest rate pass-  
through, the negative deposit facility rate 
played a considerable part in a decline in inter -
est rates in all three surveyed lending categor -
ies. There were no reports of lending rate hikes 
to stabilise margins. The negative rate on the deposit facility, taken in isolation and on bal -
ance, made a considerable contribution to the 
growing pressure on margins during the previ-
ous six months. In contrast to the institutions in 
the euro area as a whole, however, German 
banks reported that their margins for consumer 
credit – which they had been able to keep vir -
tually stable overall in the past six months  – 
had not been affected on balance by the nega -
tive interest rate. Banks in the German sample 
also noted positive effects on margins in isol -
ated cases where banks had succeeded in 
keeping their individual lending rates relatively 
constant in comparison with lower funding costs. In contrast to Germany, a significant 
number of the surveyed institutions in the rest 
of the euro area responded to the negative rate 
on the deposit facility by raising their non-  
interest rate charges. Both in Germany and the euro area as a whole, the impact of the nega -
tive deposit facility rate on the volume of credit 
was relatively small overall; as a tendency – in 
the case of loans to households – there were 
signs, rather, that the lending volume increased 
on balance. In April of this year, the German 
participants in the survey expected the deposit 
facility rate, on balance, to have an even 
stronger negative impact on their net interest 
income over the following six months. With re -
gard to the other surveyed factors, they were 
anticipating similar effects to those in the six 
months prior to April.Ad hoc question

Conclusions
During the financial and sovereign debt crisis, 
the Bank Lending Survey, thanks to its flexible 
design, made a key contribution to a better 
and near-  time assessment of the lending policy 
of banks in Germany and the euro area as a 
whole. The ad hoc questions also supplied im-
portant information for gauging the impact of 
non- standar d monetary policy measures and 
regulatory initiatives.
In Germany, the system of personally interview-
ing the respondent senior bank executives is 
especially valuable in ensuring the quality of 
the surveyed data. The time series which are now available for several ad hoc  questions, 
too, are useful not just for preparing monetary 
policy decisions but also for research analysis 
and financial stability-  r elated issues. Supply and 
demand effects on credit growth can be ana -lysed in isolation from each other, for example, 
as in the case of the highlighted credit supply 
shocks. Furthermore, analysis of behavioural 
differences among various categories of banks 
–  for which the current BLS sample is well-  
suited – can provide relevant and interesting 
insights, especially in the context of the Ger -
man banking system.
Analysis of specific questions in the BLS is likely 
to remain of particular interest in the near 
future  . F or Germany, there arises the question 
of how long the competition-  induced narr ow-
ing of margins will persist. Rising demand for 
loans for house purchases in Germany – an on -
going trend since 2010 – will also remain under 
scrutiny. Not least, interest will also continue to 
be focused on the – both positive and nega -
tive  – effects of the non-  standar d monetary 
policy measures and the negative deposit facil -
ity rate.Country-  specific

Approaches to resolving sovereign debt 
 crises in the euro area
During the course of the financial and sovereign debt crisis, a number of new mechanisms were 
created to foster coordination and overcome crises. The frequent increases in mutualised liability, with the exception of the banking union, have not, in practice, been accompanied by an intensi -
fication of joint control and decision mechanisms. Instead, the original governance framework of the European monetary union (EMU) has essentially been retained. Despite the implementation of 
additional coordination mechanisms, the member states are still largely accountable for their 
own fiscal and economic policy. At present, there do not appear to be majorities in favour of 
transferring sovereign rights, which would be necessary in order to make a major step towards deeper integration in a comprehensive fiscal and political union. In this case, reform efforts should 
aim to strengthen the basic principles agreed for the euro area and to safeguard the price 
stability-  oriented monetary policy.
When combating sovereign debt crises in the euro area, it is, in principle, prohibited for either the other member states or the Eurosystem to shore up a member states’ solvency. It is therefore cru -
cial to ensure sound public finances at the national level and to strengthen financial stability by limiting the negative interplay between governments and systemically important financial institu -
tions on a long-  term basis. This ultimately implies that the monetary union must also be able to 
withstand the extreme scenario of a default of a member state. The European Stability Mechan-ism (ESM), which was set up in 2012, plays a decisive role in combating fiscal crises. In the event of liquidity problems, the ESM can provide financial assistance by implementing adjustment pro -
grammes. However, this presumes that the debt burden of the country in question is sustainable.
On the basis of past experience, this article presents a number of approaches aimed at improving 
the euro-  ar ea crisis resolution mechanism in the medium to long term and also to allow a neces -
sary restructuring to be carried out in an orderly manner. This concerns, for one thing, the stand -
ardised conditions for future government bond issues (the bond terms). For instance, the inclusion 
of an automatic extension of maturities in the event of the implementation of an ESM programme could help to better distinguish between temporary liquidity problems and fundamental sustain-
ability problems, as well as to strengthen the individual responsibility of investors, increase the 
clout of the ESM and contain the transfer of risk to the public sector and the other member states. 
Furthermore, in the event of overindebtedness, the necessary agreement between debtors and 
creditors could be simplified and accelerated by replacing the majority requirement in the collect -
ive action clauses with a one-  l imb procedure. Moreover, should a restructuring become neces -
sary, it would also make sense to implement a more rule-  bound procedure and to lay down the 
assignment of the necessary coordinating tasks in order to ensure an orderly and transparent 
procedure. This could mitigate the problems associated with a sovereign debt crisis. Ultimately, these additions could help to make a significant contribution towards strengthening the current 
no- bail-  out principle and the member states’ individual r esponsibility and thus, going forward, 
also towards reducing the likelihood of a government becoming overindebted.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
In March 2015, the Bundesbank published an 
overview of the changes made to the govern -
ance framework of the EMU since the onset of 
the financial and sovereign debt crisis as well as 
a number of different approaches to make the 
framework more resilient.1 This article focuses 
in greater depth on ways to combat sovereign 
debt crises in the euro area, including debt re -
structuring. It begins by addressing central 
measures and reforms in the euro area and the 
key elements required to create a consistent 
governance framework for the EMU. In a fur -
ther step, it then looks at selected challenges in 
connection with the resolution of government financing crises and any necessary debt restruc -
turing, before moving on to discuss possible 
reform approaches.
The financial and sovereign 
debt crisis has highlighted the need for reform in the governance framework of the EMU
During the financial and debt crisis, a number 
of euro-  ar ea member states were cut off from 
the capital markets and financial stability in the 
euro area appeared to be in jeopardy. In view 
of these risks, financial assistance was granted 
by the other member states, and the ESM was 
set up to ultimately act as a permanent assis -
tance fund. At the same time, a number of re -
forms were implemented which, among other 
things, were intended to mitigate the mutual 
reinforcement of problems in the financial sec -
tor and in public finances (sovereign-  bank  
nexus).2 In order to prevent or correct future 
undesirable macroeconomic developments, the 
macroeconomic imbalance procedure was 
introduced. It was also envisaged that the Sta -
bility and Growth Pact be toughened up and more firmly anchored across national regula -
tions with the aim of ensuring sound public 
 finances. With its first pillar, the Single Supervis -ory Mechanism (SSM), the banking union is in -
tended to help forestall financial distress in the banking system. With its second pillar, the Sin -
gle Resolution Mechanism (SRM), the aim is, among other things, to avoid having to use government funds in future to bail out the 
banking system.3
These reforms may contribute towards the pre -
vention and resolution of future crises. How -
ever, with the exception of the banking union, the increases in mutualised liability have not, in 
practice, been accompanied by any substantial 
intensification of joint control and decision 
mechanisms. Furthermore, the design and im -
plementation of the new regulations, such as 
in the area of fiscal rules, raise considerable 
doubts regarding their effectiveness.4 Nor has 
adequate progress been made to date in con -
taining the direction of impact of the fiscal dis -
tortions from the government to the banking Proposals to 
ensure a more effective reso-lution of sover-eign debt crises

system.5 On the whole, quite a number of 
loopholes have yet to be closed, and the imbal -
ance between liability and control potentially 
creates substantial misguided incentives for 
policymakers and financial market participants 
alike.6
Deeper economic and fiscal policy integration 
could prove to be a consistent reform option 
for the euro area. Even if the corresponding 
proposals are often primarily aimed at expand -
ing joint liability even further,7 a greater depth 
of integration would, however, require that 
relevant decision-  making powers also be tr ans-
ferred to democratically legitimate European 
institutions, and ensuring a stability oriented policy as a whole.
8 However, national policy -
makers are not pursuing a change to the EU treaties at present and there are no apparent 
majorities in favour of surrendering sovereign 
powers. As long as this remains the case, the 
priority must be to strengthen the agreed gov -
ernance framework for the euro area.9 In this 
regard, the euro area is based on an independ -
ent monetary policy with a clear mandate to safeguard price stability, and it places an em -
phasis on the individual responsibility of the 
member states and the financial market partici-
pants. The formation of a fiscal bail-  out com -
munity and the financing of governments 
through monetary policy are, however, pro -
hibited.
This means that government financing difficul -
ties, and also the possibility of a euro-  ar ea 
member state defaulting, cannot be ruled out. 
The crisis has, however, shown that this frame -
work is stretched to its limits when the eco -
nomic and political costs resulting from sover -
eign solvency problems are considered to be 
much higher than the costs involved in grant -
ing public financial assistance. This can be ex -
pected, in particular, where financial stability as 
a whole appears to be threatened, and the 
costs of a default occur in the short term, while those arising from granting financial assistance 
are more of a medium to long-  term natur e. 
Against this backdrop, the ESM saw the cre -ation of a support mechanism to provide assis -
tance in the event of government liquidity 
problems. As a general rule, however, the ESM 
is not allowed to grant funds to overindebted 
governments, and the possibility of a default is not ruled out. Therefore, further reforms should 
aim to anchor a stability-  oriented fiscal policy in 
the member states, to prevent systemic conta -
gion effects as far as possible and to strengthen 
financial stability as a whole. Ultimately, macro -
economic imbalances, excessive government 
debt or even a (partial) default must also be 
manageable. Otherwise, the euro area is likely 
to remain vulnerable to crises. An overview of 
the reforms and measures proposed and dis -
cussed in further detail in the Bundesbank’s March 2015 Monthly Report  can be found in 
the table on page 44.

5 In order to limit banks’ risk arising from sovereign expos -
ures, it is currently being debated whether the preferential regulatory treatment of sovereign debt securities should be 
reduced. It would also be important to back these claims 
with capital in a risk-  appr opriate manner and to implement 
large exposure limits in order to sever the sovereign-  bank  
nexus. It would be essential to ensure that any losses which could occur elsewhere outside of banks’ balance sheets re -
main manageable for the financial market as a whole. For

states that have been cut off from the financial 
market, but not to overindebted governments, 
on the condition that the member state in 
question adopts an economic and fiscal adjust-
ment programme.10 If, despite a reasonable 
level of own efforts, major doubts still exist re -
garding debt sustainability, these are to be 
cleared up in advance by adopting suitable 
measures such as by involving private creditors 
(debt restructuring). In the interest of an effect -

foremost to minimise the macroeconomic 
damage, to support stable macroeconomic de -
velopments and to safeguard the long-  term  
sustainability of public finances.Distinguishing between 
 temporary financing difficulties 
and fundamental sustainability 
problems
When a government experiences acute finan -
cing difficulties in the capital market, it is often 
challenging to determine whether this is due to 
just a temporary liquidity shortage, which can 
be overcome by providing liquidity loans 
through an assistance programme, or due to a Reliable assess-

fundamental problem of the government’s 
ability or willingness to pay. The assessment of 
the macroeconomic and fiscal perspectives 
and, in particular, the assertiveness of govern -
ments in implementing unpopular consolida -
tion measures play a decisive role in this con -
text. It is often the case that only during the 
course of an adjustment programme is it pos -
sible to see whether the causes of the acute 
financing difficulties can be rectified by imple-
menting the agreed reforms (liquidity problem) 
or whether debt restructuring is required (fun-
damental sustainability problem). A crisis reso -
lution mechanism should prevent debt restruc -
turing from being carried out in the event of 
a liquidity problem and creditors from receiving 
a full payout in the case of a sustainability 
problem.
Make governments and 
 investors accountable for 
their actions
An effective crisis management strategy should 
preserve the responsibility of the member state 
concerned and the investors. Thus, within an 
adjustment programme, the citizens of the 
member states should remain primarily respon -
sible for the solution to national financial prob -
lems. The member states are ultimately solely 
responsible for deciding on and implementing 
the domestic distribution of the adjustment burden (ownership). If it becomes apparent 
over time that the government’s ability to pay 
cannot be restored by this alone, the creditors 
should be held accountable for their invest -
ment decisions and not released from their 
liability   by granting public financial assistance.
Avoid delays in implementing 
necessary adjustment 
 measures
Where government financing problems occur, 
both the debtor country and its creditors could 
have an interest in delaying the implementa -tion of crisis resolution measures (gambling for 
resurrection). Often, a government may want 
to avoid the political costs involved in imple -
menting an adjustment programme or in debt 
restructuring. In addition, the predominately 
negative impact of a necessary consolidation 
on economic activity in the short term is likely 
to cause the parties concerned to hope that 
the economic situation improves by itself with -
out resorting to any measures, and to put off a 
necessary restructuring until it becomes un -
avoidable. Creditors, by their very nature, have 
an interest in receiving a full payout of their 
claims. They will hope that a necessary debt re-
structuring will be delayed or will not material -
ise or that the adjustment burden will be car -
ried by other private or public creditors. A 
delayed crisis resolution is, however, associated 
with prolonged spells of uncertainty and, as a 
rule, has a negative impact on further eco -
nomic developments and increases the eco -
nomic costs. In this respect, it is important that 
the necessary adjustment processes are initi -
ated in a timely manner.11 At the same time, a 
mechanism of this kind must not present gov -
ernments with an easy way to be rid of their 
debt burden. The incentives for ensuring a sus -
tainable fiscal and economic policy must be 
preserved.
Preserve the clout of the ESM 
in tackling crises
The ESM has limited resources at its disposal, 
which means that it is essential to keep the use 
of the ESM’s funds to a minimum in each spe-
cific case. This, however, also applies with re-
gard to the incentives for investors to make an appropriate risk assessment and to limiting the 
burden on the taxpayer in those countries pro -
viding assistance. In the case of the assistance 
programmes in place to date, however, large Preserve respon-
sibility of

parts of public funds have been used to finance   
maturing bonds, resulting in the funds being 
rapidly depleted, and private investors have, at 
least in part, been released from their liability.
Should restructuring prove 
 inevitable, make the procedure 
efficient
Acute government financing difficulties and the threat of overindebtedness harbour the risk of 
disorderly developments, not only limiting fiscal 
policy leeway but also placing a strain on the 
financial system and even, in extreme cases, on 
the functional viability of the national economy 
as a whole. Due to the close (financial and) economic interdependencies that exist in the 
euro area, contagion effects on other member 
states are foreseeable. The ESM is designed to 
prevent critical escalation and avoid the eco -
nomic cost of the disorderly developments that 
would otherwise tend to follow. However, 
there is no procedure laid down in current 
regulations on how to carry out the inevitable 
process of debt restructuring in the event of a 
government running up excessive debt. That 
being said, an effective crisis management 
resolution should, in the interest of all parties 
concerned, bring with it planning certainty and 
help debt restructuring negotiations run 
smoothly. In this way, it is possible to limit the 
burden arising from consolidation measures, a 
haircut and macroeconomic side-  effects. It is  
therefore necessary to reconcile the interests of 
all parties concerned, and to foster an environ -
ment in which all claims receive equal treat -
ment, especially by minimising the associated 
coordination issues.12
From the creditors’ viewpoint, it is only expedi -
ent to agree to a haircut if there would other -
wise be a danger of even higher losses, and if 
the value of their remaining claims would sub-
sequently seem safer. The latter presupposes 
confidence in the crisis resolution mechanism, 
the debtor country’s willingness to reform and 
pay, and improved macroeconomic and finan -cial prospects following restructuring. If there is 
any doubt in this regard, creditors are more 
likely to try to avoid losses and press for the 
regular payment of their claims.13 Potential 
conflicts between creditor groups exacerbate 
the problem, especially when individual invest -
ors refuse to cooperate and are able to enforce their claims at the expense of the other credit -
ors (holdout). The lower the haircut, the more 
likely creditors are to agree to debt restructur -
ing. This entails the risk of restructuring proving 
insufficient, thus possibly rendering it necessary 
to restructure the debt again or placing a strain 
on the crisis resolution mechanism in future.

12 The lessons learned from the restructuring of Greek 
debt in 2012 illustrate the problems with the current pro -
cedure. A liquidity problem was assumed when the first economic adjustment programme was negotiated. Over the course of this programme, private creditors were re -
leased of liability when their debt instruments matured and risks were transferred to the public creditors. The excessive 
level of Greek debt became apparent during the second 
economic adjustment programme. The participation of the 
remaining private creditors in the debt restructuring was achieved by retroactively amending the bond contracts under Greek law and using additional funds provided by 
the fiscal assistance mechanisms. At the same time, credit -
ors who primarily held Greek government bonds that had 
been issued under another legislation received full repay -
ment. See Committee on International Economic Policy and Reform, Revisiting sovereign bankruptcy, Report, 
Brookings Institution, October 2013; and J Zettel  meyer , 
C Trebesch and M Gulati (2013), The Greek debt restructur -
ing: an autopsy, Economic Policy 28(75), pp 513-563. The 
vast majority of debt restructuring carried out in recent 
decades took place in developing countries and emerging 
market economies. See D Udaibir, M Papaioannou and C 
Trebesch, Sovereign debt restructurings 1950-2010: litera -
ture survey, data and stylized facts, IMF Working Paper 12/  
203. The challenges surrounding crisis resolution and crisis management in the euro area differ from those.13 Other countries or multilateral institutions could also, as 
creditors, have an incentive to hold out for an improved 
scenario that does not involve restructuring as, in addition to suffering financial losses, they could also be faced with significant political costs.Deutsche Bundesbank

tured procedure in the event of debt restructur -
ing.
Change standardised terms 
of euro-  ar ea sovereign bonds
Automatic maturity extension in the case 
of ESM programmes
Euro-  ar ea member states finance themselves 
predominantly through bonds, for which they 
have agreed on standardised terms. In the case 
of newly issued bonds, these terms could be 
supplemented by a passage stipulating that 
their maturity will be automatically extended by three years, for instance, under identical terms as soon as a member state receives ESM assis-
tance.14 It is of particular importance in this 
context that the extension constitutes neither a 
restructuring nor a credit event, as this would 
form part of the bond’s terms and be known 
when buying the bond.
It is necessary to perform a debt sustainability 
analysis before any assistance is provided under the ESM. In the event of overindebtedness, the 
first step would be to restructure the debt. If a 
liquidity shortfall were mistaken for overindebt -
edness, this could potentially lead to an ultim-
ately unnecessary process of restructuring with 
all its unwanted side-  effects. But what is likely 
to be of greater relevance in practice would be to initially fail to recognise a need for debt re -
structuring and instead first identify it as merely 
a liquidity problem.
15 Under the current set-  up, 
financial aid is used to repay holders of matur -
ing securities. Taxpayers in countries providing 
assistance assume considerable risks under the 
programme as, in addition to the deficits (in -
cluding interest payments on sovereign debt), 
redemptions – which are generally far more 
substantial – are also financed.
Automatically extending maturities would sig -
nificantly mitigate the diagnostic problem. If no 
need for debt restructuring is identified, a country could receive financial aid under an 
ESM programme to cover its financing require -
ments,16 adjustment measures would be de -
cided on and implemented in a controlled manner, and bondholders would not be re -
leased of their liability. A decision pertaining to 
the possible need for restructuring could be made in further course when, once progress has been made in implementing the pro -
gramme, a clearer picture emerges of the 
member state’s macroeconomic and fiscal out -
look. Should it nevertheless become necessary 
to restructure debt in further course, extending 
the maturities of government bonds could 
allow this to take place under less time pres -
sure, based on a more certain outlook and 
therefore in a more targeted and orderly man -
ner.
Compared with the status quo , the level of 
ESM funds deployed for each assistance pro -
gramme would be considerably lowered. Con -
sequently, its clout and credibility as a stabilisa -
tion mechanism would be enhanced, while the 
risks for taxpayers in the other member states 
would be significantly reduced.
Automatic maturity extensions in the event of 
government financing problems could provide 
a possible incentive for governments to use this Automatic

wards, Monthly Report, August 2011, pp 68-71; and Bank 
of England, Sovereign default and state-  contingent debt,  
Financial Stability Paper 27, November 2013. To date, the 
programmes have run for three years, during which period uncertainty about further developments is likely to diminish substantially.
15 This diagnostic problem presents a particular difficulty 
with regard to the current design of the ESM assistance 
programmes.16 A temporary maturity extension could even be triggered 
upon submitting an application if it were initially limited to 
the decision-  making period envisaged under the pr ocedure 
for an assistance programme (probably around one to two 
months). This would reduce the risk of unwanted default 
and ensure that liability remains with the investors during 
the negotiation period. The maturity would not be auto -
matically extended by three years until the ESM programme 
was adopted. Any temporary assistance to cover acute 
 financing needs above and beyond that would have to be 
made subject to special collateralisation requirements and, like regular financial aid, would be excluded from any debt restructuring.Deutsche Bundesbank

time gained to postpone necessary – and polit-
ically uncomfortable – reforms. However, this 
could be counteracted by linking automatic 
maturity extensions to a commitment to ad-
here to a targeted reform programme. On the one hand, this results in the maturity of bonds 
purchased by creditors being extended; on the 
other hand, the probability of repayment 
should be higher compared with a procedure 
that does not involve a programme, as the 
financial   aid pr ovided and adjustment meas -
ures implemented under a programme would 
probably improve the outlook for sustainability 
significantly. In addition, restructuring would, 
on the whole, be less likely than in a scenario 
without a programme. It would therefore also 
remain in the creditors’ interest for the imple -
mentation of the adjustment programme to 
succeed.
Upon introduction of the maturity extension, 
government financing costs could most likely 
increase for those member states in which in -
vestors see the possibility of an ESM pro -
gramme being implemented within the regular 
time span of their bonds. These investors would 
then assume that the maturity of their bonds 
would, with a certain probability, be extended. All other things being equal, however, it would 
be quite unlikely for a maturity extension to 
lead to an increase in financing costs such that 
they would, in total, exceed the costs associ -
ated with a bond running three years more, in 
which case the implementation of an ESM 
programme   w ould already be firmly expected. 
Provided the yield curve were rather flat for 
medium   to longer-  term debt, interest effects 
would probably remain within limits overall.17 
Should this exacerbate the financing problems 
of a country in a doubtful financial situation, 
causing an application for ESM financial assis -
tance to be submitted at an earlier date, this 
would also counteract the tendency to post -
pone necessary adjustment measures and, to 
this extent, should not be regarded as harmful.Reform of standardised collective action clauses
Since 2013, all bonds issued by euro-  ar ea mem -
ber states with maturities exceeding one year 
have been subject to a standardised euro col -
lective action clause (Euro-  C AC).18 This allows a 
qualified majority of holders of an individual 
bond series to agree on a modification to the 
bond’s terms that is binding for all holders of 
the series.19 If a qualified majority in presence 
of a quorum of all outstanding bond series sub -
ject to the CAC votes in favour of modifying 
the bond terms, the majority needed to modify 
the term at the single series level is lowered 
(two-  l imb majority requirement). This reduces 
the incentive to hold out. However, such a 
two- limb decision cannot pr event a blocking 
minority from being achieved by purchasing a 
sufficiently high share of an individual bond 
series. It therefore cannot be ruled out that in -
vestors could act contrary to the vote taken by 
the creditor community by moving to block the 
restructuring of their bond and press for their 
claims to be met in full.20Strengthened

17 The scenario of a programme-  driven thr ee-  year post -
ponement of maturities and redemption dates would need 
to be assigned a present value loss of the debt securities, 
the amount of which would depend on the yield curve. 
The higher this present value loss and the more investors 
consider it likely that an ESM programme will be triggered, the higher the spread they are likely to demand.18 CACs are currently not mandatory for bonds with a ma-
turity of less than one year, for regional and local govern -
ment bonds or in loan agreements. See EFC Sub-  Committee 
on EU Sovereign Debt Markets, Collective action clause 
explanatory   note, July 2 011; and Model collective action 
clause supplemental explanatory note, March 2012. The effectiveness of reform proposals would suffer if these 
forms of financing were not incorporated and utilised to a greater extent.
19 The majority requirement differs depending on the in -
tended adjustment (reserved matter or non-  r eserved mat -
ter of the bond term) and the voting procedure (bond -
holder meeting or written resolution), and on whether a 
modification is to apply to an individual bond series (single 
series) or to multiple bond series at the same time (cross 
series). If a qualified majority agrees to debt restructuring, 
this will also affect bonds held by other countries, the Euro -
system or multilateral institutions.

lective action problems in sovereign debt restructuring, IMF 
Policy Paper, September 2014.Deutsche Bundesbank

The introduction of more comprehensive ag -
gregation clauses would simplify and speed up 
the debt restructuring process. This would 
enable   a qualified majority of cr editors to be 
determined across all government bonds sub -
ject to the same CAC to trigger a debt restruc -
turing (single-  limb majority r equirement).21 Ap-
proval from the holders of each individual bond 
would then no longer be required. What is 
more, creditors would no longer need to worry 
about restructuring burdens being shifted to 
the rest of the creditor community as a result of 
individual investors successfully holding out. 
This should substantially reduce the holdout 
options and the incentive to purchase blocking 
minorities. In principle, the majority require -
ment for the first step of cross-  series r estructur -
ing currently set out in Euro-  C ACs could be 
maintained for single-  limb C ACs.22 Moreover, 
consideration could be given to lowering the 
majority requirement further in specific cases 
where restructuring is to take place as part of 
an ESM programme.23 This could reinforce the 
crisis resolution mechanism. Nevertheless, it 
must be ensured that the bondholders’ pos -
ition is not unduly weakened. It would also be 
necessary in this context to prevent a fragmen -
tation of bonds issued by member states into 
issues with different CACs.
Orderly procedure for any debt 
restructuring under an ESM programme
The prerequisite for the provision of financial 
aid under the ESM’s assistance and crisis reso -
lution mechanism is the programme country’s 
capacity to repay. Should a country be unable 
to repay, debt restructuring would require the 
involvement of private investors either prior to 
launching the programme or, if this does not 
become apparent until a later point in time, in 
further course. Under these circumstances, it 
makes sense to establish a reliable and trans -
parent procedure beforehand.24 This should 
create greater planning certainty and help keep 
friction losses, macroeconomic costs and ultim-ately also the haircut to a minimum.25 More-
over, a rule-  bound pr ocedure is better suited to 
incorporating claims arising from bonds and 
loans into restructuring negotiations.
The ESM – which already plays a key crisis man-
agement role if euro-  ar ea member states face 
financing difficulties – would be a suitable 
choice for taking on a coordinating role should 
there be a need for a debt restructuring. In 
terms of an orderly procedure, the first step 
would be to define the rights and obligations in 
the relationship between the member states, 
the creditors and the ESM as restructuring co -
ordinator, and to draw up a concrete timetable 
detailing when the individual steps in the pro -
cedure should be taken (for more information, Single-  limb

21 The introduction of single-  limb aggr egation clauses ne -
cessitates an adjustment to the uniform CACs of euro-  ar ea 
countries (Article 12(3) of the ESM Treaty) and of corres -
ponding national regulations such as, for example, sections 
4a et seq of the Federal Government Debt Management 
Act (Bundesschuldenwesengesetz).22
 Under Euro-  C ACs, the first limb with regard to a bond -
holder meeting calls for a qualified majority of 75% by 
principal amount of outstanding bonds represented at a 
quorate meeting of 66⅔% of the outstanding principal 
amount of the affected bond series; in the case of a writ -
ten resolution, modifications require the approval of 66⅔%. If these majorities are achieved, the majority re -
quirements are reduced in the second limb for the respect -
ive bond issues.23 Majority requirements also play a significant role in the 
Eurosystem’s purchase of government bonds on the sec -
ondary market, for example as part of a broad-  based pur -
chase programme (public sector purchase programme: 
PSPP).24 With a view to assessing a country’s financial situation 
and debt sustainability as objectively as possible, the pro -
cedure could still benefit from the currently envisaged – if possible – involvement of the IMF, with its expertise in ac -
companying reform and adjustment programmes and, 
where required, debt restructuring processes.

Further proposals for reforming bond contractual terms
With the automatic maturity extension in 
the case of ESM programmes and adjust-
ments to the majority requirements in col-
lective action clauses, this Monthly Report  
article introduces important approaches to 
fundamentally change the terms of sover-
eign bonds issued by euro- area countries. If 
 embedded in reforms of the governance framework of the EMU, these approaches 
could play a part in dealing with crises more effectively. Moreover, other changes to the contractual terms of future bond issues are 
currently being debated as well; two of 
these elements will be briefl  y outlined and 
discussed below. However, further analysis 
would be needed in order to better evalu-
ate the desired advantages of each against the potential drawbacks.
Splitting bonds into tranches with lower 
and higher loss risk
In order to both mitigate the negative con-
sequences of government fi  nancing diffi   cul-ties for the fi  nancial markets and strengthen 
the credibility of the no- bail- out clause of the governance framework, it is crucial to 
break the strong sovereign- bank nexus that 
persists in the euro area. In particular, the purpose of the banking union is to help avert fi  nancial distress in the banking sys-tem and to prevent use of government 
funds for bail- out purposes. However, fun-
damental changes would also have to be 
made to banking and fi  nancial market regu-
lation such that sovereign bonds are no 
longer considered as risk- free.1
With the aim of preventing undesired dis-
tortions as a result of government sustain-
ability problems, reforms have been pro-
posed which would increase the volume of 
safe assets for the fi  nancial markets and strengthen incentives to diversify, but with-
out implying any further joint liability. Vari-
ous concepts are currently under discus-sion.
2 One specifi  c proposal3 envisages 
bundling sovereign bonds of all euro- area 
countries into one bond according to a pre- 
defi  ned key. With this instrument, each 
country would continue to be liable only for the bonds that it issues. The new securitised bonds would be divided into a junior (fi  rst- 
loss) tranche and a senior (second- loss) tranche, the latter constituting European 
safe bonds, or ESBies for short. Under the 
proposal, senior tranches would be ex-
cluded from the tightening of banking and 
fi  nancial market regulation with regard to holding sovereign bonds, even though 
more stringent regulation is generally con-
sidered necessary. The combination of di-versifi  cation and tranching means that ES-Bies could indeed increase the volume of safe assets for the fi  nancial markets, al-though the individual member countries would continue to issue their bonds au-
tonomously.4 However, the proposed regu-
latory exemption for ESBies would, besides other practical problems, constitute a privil-
eging of ESBies, for example, over highly

March 2015.
3 See M Brunnermeier et al, ESBies: safety in tranches, mimeo, May 2016.4 Under the concrete proposal, the volume of poten-tially available ESBies is likely to depend on the actual division into junior and senior tranches as well as, pri-
marily, on the pre- defi  ned key by which sovereign 
bonds would have to be bundled. With a design such 
as this, the comparatively low level of government debt in individual euro- area member states would 
probably limit the ESBies issued.Deutsche Bundesbank

rated national sovereign bonds.5 In add-
ition, the proposed mandatory composition 
of the bonds, which would then continue 
to benefi  t from preferential regulatory treat-
ment, would be determined according to a specifi  c key covering all euro- area countries. This would be tantamount to distorting risk 
premiums in favour of countries whose debt securities would otherwise be in less demand. At the end of the day, the pros 
and cons of tranched securities would de-
pend on the specifi  c design. A market- 
based solution6 which does not provide for 
additional joint liability or preferential regu-latory treatment would be compatible with 
the existing governance framework of the 
EMU, however.
As an alternative, tranching of the respect-
ive national bonds is currently also under 
discussion. This proposal, too, would re-quire tighter banking and fi  nancial market 
regulation with a view to enabling systemic-
ally important fi  nancial institutions to cope 
with unsound developments in public fi  -
nances or to be resolved in an orderly fash-
ion in that risks stemming, in particular, 
from sovereign bonds are subjected to ad-
equate regulatory requirements. In this con-
text, dividing the individual national bonds 
into a junior and a senior tranche (national safe bonds, or NaSBies for short) could help 
to increase the volume of safe assets, 
thereby making it easier to implement the 
regulatory reform.7 Here, each member 
state would have to continue issuing its bonds on its own responsibility. However, 
every bond would comprise two tranches, 
each with a pre- defi  ned distribution of loss 
in the event of a debt restructuring (ie the 
two tranches would only be issued in tan-
dem). Thus, this proposal is not about the 
separate sale or purchase of individual 
tranches of a bond issue, but about distrib-
uting government loss risks within a fi  nan-cial system with risk- appropriate regulation 
of government debt securities.
Nothing would change as a result for cred-
itors of bonds already outstanding. All is-
sued bonds, ie previously issued (un-tranched) bonds and the new (tranched) 
bonds, would have to be treated equally in debt restructuring negotiations. But for the 
new bond format, any loss on the bond 
– which would be identical to the loss on a non- tranched bond – would fi  rst have to be 
borne solely by the junior tranche. The 
second- loss (senior) tranche would only be 
affected once the junior tranche was com-
pletely used up.8 If the prescribed division 
envisaged a 60% senior and a 40% junior 
tranche, say, the senior tranche would not 
5 The concept currently on the table suggests possibly 
passing on the practical implementation, ie producing the ESBies, to private issuers. Beforehand, however, it would have to be clarifi  ed how to reliably ensure that 
earnings and, in particular, potential losses stemming 
from the fi  nancial intermediary’s regular business activ-
ities do not affect the cash fl  ows from the junior tranches and the ESBies, and vice versa. This could make it necessary to coordinate the issues of the 
underlying sovereign bonds to be able to prevent po-
tential liquidity risks stemming from different cash 
fl  ows at the intermediary. In addition, the specifi  c pro-cedure in the event of the resolution of an intermedi-ary would have to take such potential interaction into 
account, and appropriate regulations would have to 
be laid down beforehand. An implicit or explicit gov-
ernment guarantee would create misguided incentives and increase the mutualisation of liability.
6 Tighter regulation with regard to holding sovereign 
bonds could give market participants an incentive to diversify as well as to create safer assets through 
 securitisation and tranching. The weighting of the indi-vidual government bonds of such securitisations would then be the result of a market process.7 See Deutsche Bundesbank, Approaches to strength-ening the regulatory framework of European monetary 
union, Monthly Report, March 2015, pp 15-37; and

stalten – für eine stabilitätsorientierte Währungsunion, Wirtschaftsdienst, September 2015, pp 604-608.
8 The new bond would initially have to be bought 
containing both tranches together. Investors could subsequently hold both tranches, sell individual tranches or sell both tranches together. If the bond 
were held with both tranches, this would be equiva-
lent to purchasing a bond in the present form; in the 
event of a debt restructuring, a bond of this format 
would then be affected by a haircut to the same  extent in fi  nancial terms as the “old” (present) bond format.Deutsche Bundesbank  
Monthly Report

be affected by a haircut unless the haircut 
exceeded 40% of the total volume of all 
the outstanding sovereign bonds.9
One would expect both the junior and the 
senior tranche of a bond issued by a highly- rated country to be deemed safe. But gen-erally speaking, countries with a poorer rat-
ing, too, could see their senior tranches rated as safer bonds and receive a better 
ranking for them than for their present, un-
tranched bonds. Accordingly, a larger vol-ume of highly rated government bonds could be made available by more coun-
tries10 – bonds which banks would need to 
back with less capital if the necessary bank-
ing and fi  nancial market regulation were executed. The government default risk 
would generally be concentrated in the jun-ior tranches. One effect of regulation could 
then be that the risky junior tranches are distributed to those areas of the fi  nancial 
system which are better able to absorb any losses or are less interconnected with other 
fi  nancial market participants. The pressure on monetary policymakers to also accept sovereign bonds of poor credit quality as collateral for refi  nancing operations or as 
part of an asset purchase programme could subside as a result.
The specifi  c pros and cons would have to be examined in greater detail, as they 
would with regard to the ESBies proposal, 
too. The effects on sovereign borrowing 
costs would also need to be looked at more closely. Generally speaking, the tranching of 
national government bonds should not, in 
itself, have any major impact on the prob-
ability of default or on risk premiums. As 
the bonds would fi  rst be issued as a single entity (as is the case with bonds at present), 
a change in the individual countries’ fi  nan-
cing conditions would be unlikely – all other things being equal – solely as a result of the 
proposed tranching. But the yield spread between the junior and the senior tranche 
would probably be greater, the higher the 
assessment of a sovereign’s default risk. A 
country’s risk premium could rise as a 
whole, however, if the tranching were ac-
companied by further adjustments to the 
bond terms and the governance framework 
of the EMU, and if investors consequently considered the overall possibility of a bail- 
out by other member countries or by means of monetary policy to be less likely. A higher 
risk premium would ultimately not pose a 
problem, though, if the sovereign solvency 
risk were adequately priced in by the mar-
ket.11
GDP- linked bonds
To be able to better avert sovereign debt 
crises in future and to deal with them more 
effectively if they do occur, discussions are 
currently under way on issuing sovereign 
bonds with a coupon and/or a redemption amount that would be linked to growth of gross domestic product (GDP).
12 If the econ-
9 Accompanying reforms of, among other things, col-
lective action clauses would be needed to ensure that a debt restructuring remains possible and, at the same 
time, that a haircut does not constitute an easy way 
for governments to be rid of their debt burden. From a legal perspective, it would need to be defi  ned how, if 
debt restructuring negotiations became necessary, 
claims of a junior tranche would be represented when 
a junior tranche was no longer held along with the 
senior tranche.
10 See also M Brunnermeier et al (2016), The 
sovereign- bank diabolic loop and ESBies, American Economic Review: Papers & Proceedings, 106(5), 
pp 508-512.11 The proposed tranching would lead to a lower vol-
ume of individual tranches than in the case of an un-tranched bond, which is why the new bond structure could result in a certain increase in liquidity premiums. 
Yet given the similarity of the bond yields of member 
countries with very different issue volumes in the run- 
up to the crisis, such an increase could prove to be 
rather insignifi  cant.

omy as a whole were to perform better 
than had been forecast when the bond was 
issued, this would benefi  t the holders of 
GDP- linked bonds. On the other hand, if 
there were an unexpected, less favourable 
development, lower payment obligations would take pressure off the country’s fi  -
nances. In this way, the risks and opportun-
ities presented by uncertain economic de-
velopments would, to an extent, be shifted 
away from public fi  nances to the private 
sector. For advocates of GDP- linked bonds, this holds the promise of strengthening the 
resilience of public fi  nances against nega-
tive shocks. This could serve to reduce the 
risk of a sovereign debt crisis involving high macroeconomic costs, and leave greater fi  s-
cal policy leeway to deal with a negative 
shock. In particular, this would be the case 
if the sovereign bonds were widely distrib-
uted internationally, meaning that the bur-
dens caused by a negative shock would be spread globally, too.
Moreover, GDP- linked bonds could be used 
in the event of a debt restructuring.
13 Given 
that growth prospects are particularly un-certain in such a situation, these bonds could help to facilitate an agreement be-
tween the debtor country and its creditors 
and in limiting the danger of having to re-
peat a restructuring procedure. Ultimately, 
the deleveraging would be greater if devel-opments proved to be less favourable than 
anticipated in the baseline scenario under-
lying a sovereign debt restructuring. Con-
versely, it would be lower if developments 
were more favourable.
In this context, the impacts of GDP- indexed 
bonds would largely hinge on the specifi  c 
bond design, and no standardised instru-
ment has been developed thus far.14 Before 
they could be widely introduced as a regu-
lar fi  nancing instrument, the drawbacks 
they would entail would likewise have to be examined more closely and weighed up 
against the advantages. For instance, GDP- linked bonds could help reduce the danger of a sovereign losing access to capital mar-
kets, and blunt any need for short- term 
procyclical consolidation measures. On the 
other hand, risks would be shifted to the private sector that could also affect fi  nan-cial stability and macroeconomic develop-
ments. One point that is likely to be crucial 
is whether GDP- linked bonds are primarily held domestically or abroad, and how 
negative global shocks in the fi  nancial sys-
tem would be dealt with. If GDP- linked 
bonds were mainly held by domestic play-
ers, less of a smoothing effect on the econ-omy as well as on the robustness of public 
fi  nances would be expected overall. How-ever, a fundamentally stable fi  nancial sys-
tem would be a prerequisite for introducing GDP- linked bonds to ensure that the unex-
pected fl  uctuations in the instrument’s value and payments can be absorbed by 
the creditors in such a way that they do not exacerbate or even trigger a systemic fi  nan-cial crisis. Otherwise, there is a danger that 
the risks ultimately have to be shouldered 
by the state (or community of states) again after all. Another danger could be that the desired relief would only come after a time 
lag pending more reliable data on eco-
nomic developments. Nor can the basic un-
certainties involved in objectively calculat-ing GDP be dismissed out of hand; more-
over, it would have to be ensured that the 
data are transparent and largely protected 
against manipulation. On the whole, the ef-

when Greece’s debt was restructured in 2012. See, for

see, for example, the chart on p 60). To en -
hance credibility, the individual steps could be 
incorporated into the ESM Treaty. The aim of 
entrusting the tasks to the ESM would be to 
ensure that the otherwise loose elements of a 
debt restructuring are effectively coordinated.
The restructuring of sovereign debt differs in a 
number of ways from a private corporate in -
solvency. For instance, the primary objective 
cannot be to liquidate the available assets.26 
Rather, the goal is to restore a sustainable 
financial   situation as quickly and on as dur able 
a basis as possible – including a sound macro -
economic perspective – not least in order to be able to service the remaining debts. This should 
be ensured, in particular, through the adjust -
ment programme that is to be agreed in such a 
situation and which should include both the 
ESM assistance and a debt restructuring. In this 
context, the member state’s national responsi -
bility must be observed and it cannot be forced to implement debt restructuring. This would be in conflict with the principles of constitutional 
sovereignty and democratic self-  determination. 
A restructuring coordinator is therefore not 
able to make an autonomous decision about a 
debt restructuring, but merely supports an or -
derly process and the search for compromise. 
The debtor country must ultimately play its part 
in the agreed procedure. Finally, a debt restruc -
turing requires the agreement of the credit -
ors  – in line with the pre-  defined majorities.  
However, this is only likely to come about if the 
member state credibly indicates that it will rig -
orously implement the necessary reform meas -
ures. It thus remains the case that any meas -
ures would hinge on cooperation between the National sover-
eignty and need to fulfil sover-eign tasks must be taken into accountfect of GDP- indexed bonds would probably 
also depend on the maturity structure: the 
shorter the maturity of the outstanding 
bonds, the less relief likely to be experi-enced by the government budget in the event of adverse developments, as its im-pact would only last until the maturity of the respective bond. Investors’ yield de-mands with regard to new issues would likely be adjusted to the revised growth 
forecasts.
Essentially, sovereign borrowing costs would probably rise if such bonds were 
introduced, because risks would be passed 
through to the private sector. Investors would demand compensation if the risks under a GDP- linked bond were not nega-
tively correlated with the risk profi  le of their remaining portfolio. If the resilience of pub-
lic finances to negative shocks were 
strengthened, however, at least the default- related part of the risk premiums could de-crease as a result.
26 Moreover, the value of sovereign assets is uncertain, 
not least in a crisis situation, and assets can only be liquid -
ated to a limited extent.Deutsche Bundesbank

member states and the creditors.27 In this con -
text, the ESM’s goal should be to reconcile the 
interests of all the parties and support a rapid 
restoration of the sovereign’s ability to pay 
without pushing for a premature or excessive 
haircut.28
In this context, thought could be given to fun -
damentally strengthening the role of the ESM. 
When a member state requests financial assis -
tance from the ESM, the assessment of further 
economic developments, debt sustainability 
and financial requirements are currently drawn 
up by the European Commission in liaison with 
the ECB, and this is also envisaged for the monitoring of economic policy conditions. These tasks could in future be transferred to the ESM, or the latter could take the leading role in the process. To this end, the compre -
hensive information on the country’s current 
situation would have to be submitted to the 
ESM along with the request for financial assis -
tance and subsequently checked. At the same 
time, when drawing up an assistance pro -
gramme, the sovereign exposures would also 
need to be recorded by a central body. This 
task could likewise be assigned to the ESM. 
However, this new strand of work, which 
would need to be specified in advance, would 
only become relevant if a member state is 
found to be overindebted. To this end, credit -
ors of bonds and credit obligations could be 
asked to register their claims as a precautionary measure when the request is submitted.
29 The 
ESM could subsequently check the claims and, 
where appropriate, rank them according to dif-
ferent servicing categories to ensure that veri -
fied claims in the same group can be given 
equal treatment during the debt restructuring 
negotiations.30
If the ESM decides as part of the debt sustain -
ability analyses that a debt restructuring is a ne -
cessary prerequisite for an adjustment pro -
gramme or the continuation thereof, this as -
sessment should serve as a starting point for 
the negotiations on how to distribute the ad -
justment burdens. During the exploratory talks and negotiations, the interests of the debtor 
state and claimants should be reconciled; this 
will then facilitate an agreement on a reform 
programme and a debt restructuring plan. In this context, there must be a sharing of bur -
dens between fiscal and structural measures, 
for which the member state is responsible at a 
national level, on the one hand and reducing 
the debt burden on the other hand. To ensure 
that claimants are treated equally, in addition to the verified claims arising from sovereign 
bonds, claims from creditors arising from credit 
obligations should also be included in the ne -
gotiations. This should minimise the risk of co -
ordination problems and the opportunistic be -ESM could pro-

Agr

adjustment and debt restructur-ing plan requires appropriate 
 
reconciliation 
of interests27 To ensure that negotiations on debt restructuring do 
not start too late, an automatic debt restructuring was also discussed (sovereign CoCos). This should be triggered auto-matically if the thresholds for fiscal stress indicators – such 
as a certain debt ratio – are breached, and could, for in -
stance, be set solely for any debt in excess of the reference 
values for the Stability and Growth Pact (accountability 
bonds). See, for example, A Mody, Sovereign debt and its restructuring framework in the Eurozone, Oxford Review of 
Economic Policy, Volume 29(4), pp 715-744; and C Fuest, 
F Heinemann and C Schröder, Reformen für mehr fiskali -
sche Eigenverantwortung der Euro-  S taaten: Das Potenzial 
von Accountability Bonds, study for the Bavarian Business 
Association (Vereinigung der bayerischen Wirtschaft, vbw), 
forthcoming. However, such automatic triggers over and 
above a maturity extension present considerable problems in terms of selecting suitable indicators for debt sustainabil -
ity (eg with regard to country-  specific char acteristics, eco -
nomic content, misguided incentives, transparency, audit compliance and manipulation resistance) and, moreover, 
particularly as a result of there being no obligation to im -
plement reforms. Here, too, the onus is ultimately on the 
member state concerned to comply with the agreements 
that were previously reached.28 Owing to an automatic maturity extension in bond con -
tracts, the ESM would in future play only a relatively minor role as creditor of the member states concerned and would 
therefore have less of an interest in the member state being relieved too easily at the expense of the creditors. This could potentially increase the risk premiums of the 
other member states.
29 This also includes claims arising from purchases of 
bonds by other member states, the Eurosystem or claims of 
other multilateral institutions. Otherwise, the equal treat -
ment would be in jeopardy, private creditors might be less inclined to consent and the fragmentation of debt restruc -
turing negotiations would probably unnecessarily hamper 
the process. In the case of IMF claims arising from balance 
of payments assistance to a country, the IMF would, as it 
has up to now, have preferred creditor status.
30 If claims are not contested by the debtor country or 
other creditors, these could be deemed to have been veri-
fied. The clarification of any disputed issues could initially 
be supported by the ESM before the parties take legal ac -
tion.Deutsche Bundesbank

haviour of individual creditors preventing an 
orderly debt restructuring.
The member state’s individual responsibility 
plays a particularly important role when draw-
ing up an adjustment programme and debt re -
structuring plan that permit compromise. In 
addition to the typical consolidation measures 
and potentially improving debt sustainability 
through privatisations, a one-  off capital levy 
could also be considered when assessing debt 
sustainability and deciding how to reconcile 
the interests of the parties.31 This would be in 
line with the principle of the member states’ 
individual responsibility that is anchored in the 
governance framework of the EMU, because 
responsibility for and the making of fiscal policy 
decisions lies at the national level. Thus, un -
sound developments must also primarily be 
corrected through own funds. However, as 
stated above, the decisions on the national dis -
tribution of adjustment burdens and thus the specific measures should finally be made and 
implemented by the member state concerned. 
But, ultimately, the ESM must then have the option of recommending that the Board of 
Governors rejects a request for financial assis -
tance, particularly if the member state con -
cerned does not make sufficient efforts and 
can thus rather be judged to be unwilling to 
repay its debts.32 This would result in a less or -
derly procedure in which the ESM does not 
play a role.
The agreed adjustment programme should support sustainable economic developments 
and make it highly likely that the member 
state’s ability to repay its debts will be restored. 
If combined with the supplementary deploy -
ment of financial assistance, private creditors 
might also be more inclined to agree to a ne -
cessary haircut. The implementation of the pro -
gramme could likewise be monitored by the 
ESM in future.
However, an adjustment programme’s success 
– with or without debt restructuring – ultim-ately cannot be guaranteed even if all the measures are implemented in full. It therefore 
cannot be ruled out that the member state 
concerned is not able to return to the capital 
markets when the programme ends without restoring debt sustainability. In this case, (re -
newed) debt restructuring negotiations might 
be required. These would then also include 
those claims that have already been automatic -
ally extended or were reduced during a previ -
ous debt restructuring.33 Furthermore, it can-
not be ruled out that no agreement is reached 
on an adjustment programme or that a mem -
ber state ceases to service its debt without re -
questing financial assistance. This would pre -
sumably be the least favourable option for all 
parties. For the euro area, it is nevertheless im -
portant that financial stability is strengthened 
in future so that it is also safeguarded if such a 
scenario with potentially somewhat unorderly 
debt restructuring negotiations occurs.34
Agreement on a credible restructuring proced -
ure could result in market participants consider -
ing there to be a generally higher likelihood of 
debt restructuring occurring in future. How -
ever, it is not clear what impact this will have National respon-

31 The prospect of a one-  off capital levy in the event of a 
crisis could potentially also counter incentives for unsound fiscal policy, which might otherwise arise from the member state’s expectation that it will later be able to rid itself of its 
sovereign debt burden in a supposedly easy way at the 
 expense of the creditors (or the other member states). For 
more information, see Deutsche Bundesbank, A one-  off  
capital levy: a suitable instrument for solving national solv -
ency crises within the current EMU framework?, Monthly

N Stähler, A one-  off wealth levy? A ssessing the pros and 
cons and the importance of credibility, Fiscal Studies, forth -
coming.32
 The Board of Governors is the ESM’s political decision-  
making body. It is composed of the member states’ gov -
ernment representatives responsible for finance, each of 
whom nominates a member of the Board of Directors as 
well as the ESM Managing Director. If the ESM proposes 
granting financial assistance, the Board of Governors must 
agree to this in order to ensure the necessary democratic 
legitimacy of the associated assumption of default risks by other member states.33
 Before providing any financial assistance under a follow-  
up programme, it would have to be ensured that the ma -
turity of the restructured debt securities runs for the 
planned duration of the programme so that the ESM con -
tinues to finance outstanding deficits but not any redemp -
tion payments to private creditors.34 See Deutsche Bundesbank, Approaches to strengthen -

Outline of a reformed procedure for resolving sovereign 
debt crises in the euro area
The article weighs up a range of reform 
measures aimed at resolving the fi  nancing problems of euro- area member states. To this end, this box presents a possible plan 
for such a procedure, based on some of the reform approaches described.
1 The respect-
ive timeframes, in particular, can be set dif-
ferently. As explained in the main text, the 
prerequisite for any such procedure would 
be a prior reform of the bond terms and of the Treaty establishing the European Stabil-ity Mechanism (ESM).
Triggering the procedure and next steps
As in the past, if a member state encoun-
ters major fi  nancing diffi   culties, the crisis 
resolution procedure would be triggered by 
the member state submitting a request for 
fi  nancial assistance to the ESM. Govern-
ment bonds receive an automatic maturity 
extension once an ESM programme is in 
place, based on the assumption of an up-
front reform of the bond terms; thus, the 
maturities of the outstanding bonds would 
be extended under the agreed conditions. 
The request would initially facilitate an ex-
tension of, for example, ten weeks, prior to 
a fi  nal decision being taken regarding the programme. During this period, the ESM would conduct an initial stock- taking, on the basis of which an adjustment pro-gramme would be negotiated (within the set time) and an agreement reached re-garding any restructuring that may be ne-cessary, the latter to be negotiated with creditors. In addition, the ESM’s Board of 
Governors would need to approve any po-
tential fi  nancial assistance. Therefore, until 
a fi  nal decision has been made regarding the programme, no funding requirements arise due to redemptions.
2 Nevertheless, 
 the fi  nancing of defi  cits might be necessary. 
Any temporary assistance to cover acute fi  nancing  needs above and beyond that 
would need to be made subject to special 
collateralisation requirements and, like regular fi  nancial aid, would be excluded 
from any debt restructuring.
Initial stock- taking
In concrete terms, upon a request being 
submitted by the member state, all the rele-
vant information would need to be pre-
sented at that juncture in order to work out 
an aid programme. An initial stock- taking 
would be conducted within a fi  xed period 
of, say, four weeks from the date of submit-
ting the request. To this end, an analysis 
would be compiled of the macroeconomic 
and fi  scal situation and of the perspectives, 
in particular with respect to the sustainabil-
ity of the public fi  nances and thus to any debt restructuring deemed  necessary. The possible courses of action would also be 
drawn up.
The tasks performed by the ESM, which 
would also be responsible for overall coord-ination, would take the form of two simul-
taneous strands of work. The fi  rst of these 
would consist in the ESM preparing a pro-
jection of the macroeconomic and fi  scal de-
velopment for the member state and a forecast of that country’s expected fi  nan-cing needs amid a no- policy- change scen-ario.
3 At the same time, the ESM would 
draw up a “programme scenario” under 
which the member state would be obliged 
1 The procedure outlined here would gain in import-
ance with every new issue of a bond with the re-
formed bond terms. However, it does not offer a direct 
solution to problems posed by the, in some instances, very extensive ongoing liabilities of member states not subject to an automatic maturity extension or (aggre-
gate) collective action clauses. As such, nor does it 
provide a direct solution to the diffi   culties involved in a possible restructuring during the transition period.
2 Ideally, the member state should not submit a re-
quest a very short time before a due date that it is 
unable to comply with.3 In principle, the ESM could be supported in this task by the European Commission in liaison with the Euro-
pean Central Bank and, where appropriate and pos-
sible, the International Monetary Fund (IMF).Deutsche Bundesbank

(in keeping with the subsidiarity principle) 
to specify reforms and measures that it would implement under its own national 
responsibility to consolidate its budgets and improve the conditions for macroeconomic 
development. These scenarios provide the 
basis for the ESM’s assessment of the sus-
tainability of public fi  nances and thus also 
its quantifi  cation of any restructuring needs upon completion of the initial stock- taking.
The ESM’s second strand of work would in-
volve taking precautionary steps to quantify 
claims on the member state arising from outstanding bonds and credit obligations, should it become necessary to conduct debt restructuring. As an integral part of 
the stock- taking, the member state would 
be required to supply the ESM with an over-
view of all eligible claims. In this context, 
the ESM could function as a central point of contact for creditor claims.
4 Upon activation 
of the procedure, these creditors would be 
asked to present their claims on the state within a specifi  ed time period (eg two weeks), backed with eligible documenta-
tion.
Decision on assistance programme and 
possible restructuring
The initial stock- taking would be followed by negotiations to specify reforms and 
measures. To accommodate these, a second fi  xed timeframe of, for example, four weeks could be set.
5
Scenario involving a temporary liquidity problem
As a general rule, it is virtually impossible to 
reliably distinguish between a temporary 
liquidity  problem and sustainability diffi   cul-
ties from the outset. Where the problem is 
probably of a temporary nature and thus 
rectifi  able by means of an adjustment pro-
gramme, the approach would not change 
much under an ESM programme, in which 
case the adjustment programme would be 
substantiated following completion of the stock- taking. Where alterations to the 
drafted programme scenario seem neces-sary, any concrete reforms and measures 
should, in turn, be proposed by the mem-
ber state concerned, while the ESM would 
determine the scope of whatever fi  nancial 
aid was deemed necessary, as in the past. 
The fi  nal adjustment programme would be 
determined in accordance with the ESM’s decision- making process. Upon the pro-
gramme’s inception, the maturity extension 
stipulated in the bond contracts would result  in maturities automatically being 
extended  by three years. Thus, without trig-
gering a credit event (and the attendant potential distortions in the fi  nancial mar-
kets), investors would remain liable for their 
investment decisions over a longer time-
frame, and recourse to ESM funds would be 
limited. Implementation of the programme 
would be subject to ongoing monitoring by the ESM, and fi  nancial assistance would be paid out contingent on the implementation of the agreed measures.
Scenario involving a sustainability  problem
In the course of the initial stock- taking, 
however, it could also turn out that the 
member state is unlikely to regain access to 
the capital market by the end of the pro-gramme’s duration, even if the measures contained in the programme scenario are 
fully implemented, indicating that the prob-
lem is not a liquidity shortage but an issue 
of sustainability. In this case, a debt restruc-
turing would have to be negotiated with the creditors within the stipulated second 
timeframe of four weeks (in parallel to the 
fi  nalisation of the adjustment programme) as a prerequisite for ESM fi  nancial assis-
tance. This would entail convening an initial 
4 As an alternative, this task could be handled by a 
separate body that would present the information to 
the ESM for further processing.
5 If the ESM concludes that the member state’s re-
quest for fi  nancial assistance is basically unwarranted 
because the country concerned could overcome its dif-
fi  culties through its own efforts, the Board of Govern-ors should be advised to reject the request.Deutsche Bundesbank

meeting of all claimants at the beginning of 
the second four- week period. At this meet-
ing, the ESM would present the provision-
ally advised adjustment programme and 
specify the ensuing need for a debt restruc-turing. On this basis, the specifi  cs of distrib-
uting the adjustment burdens by way of 
reforms and potential losses for creditors as part of a debt restructuring would be nego-
tiated. Here, too, the national distribution 
of the burden would have to be proposed 
autonomously by the member state in 
question.6
During the restructuring negotiations, the 
ESM would classify the claims according to any ranking that may exist for servicing pur-poses, explore the different views, manage 
the negotiations and seek to ensure that the interests of the parties concerned are 
reconciled.7 At the end of the second four- 
week period, another bondholder meeting 
would be convened and the specifi  c re-structuring plan that had been negotiated 
would be presented for voting.8
If the debtor country cannot reach an 
agreement with its creditors at the deciding meeting, a further period of two weeks, for example, could be set in which to come up 
with a last compromise proposal.9 In the 
fi  nal vote, the (aggregated) majority re-quirement could have been reduced by a corresponding clause in the bond con-tracts.
10 If no agreement is reached, the 
ESM would have to recommend that the Board of Governors reject the request for 
fi  nancial assistance. Accompanying reforms to the governance framework of monetary 
union, implemented prior to this, would 
have to be designed in a way to ensure that 
a sovereign default outside an ESM pro-
gramme is manageable in future for fi  nan-
cial stability in the euro area.11 Regardless of 
this, neither the country in question nor its 
creditors are likely to have an interest in 
such a development.
If, however, the parties concerned manage 
to agree on a debt restructuring and an ad-justment programme at the fi  nal vote at the latest, the agreed conditionalities would be 
set with the country in question and, to-
gether with a proposal for the granting of 
fi  nancial assistance, be presented to the Board of Governors for the fi  nal decision. The restructuring would be conducted in parallel to this. The programme’s progress 
would then be monitored by the ESM on an 
ongoing basis and, as before, the fi  nancial 
assistance would be paid out contingent on 
the implementation of the agreed meas-
ures.
Course and end of the programme
If the programme runs as expected, the 
country could regain access to the capital market by the end of the programme – if 
not before – and, going forward, be able to 
service the liquidity assistance granted as 
well as private creditors’ debt securities fall-ing due.
Even if all the agreed fi  scal and structural 
reforms are implemented in full, however, it 
is uncertain whether an adjustment pro-gramme will succeed – regardless of 
6 In the case of overindebtedness, drawing on the pri-
vate net wealth of citizens for a one- off extraordinary capital levy would be an option in principle, in addition 
to permanent consolidation measures and privatisa-
tions.7 Any credit claims held by the IMF or ESM enjoy pre-ferred creditor status.8 For bonds with (reformed) collective action clauses, restructuring requires a qualifi  ed majority of creditors.9 Under certain circumstances, the establishment of a “mediation committee”, which should be independent 
to the greatest degree possible, could also be con-sidered. The European Court of Justice, for instance, 
could assume this role.10 For example, in the case of a bondholder meeting, 
the required majority could be reduced from 75% to 50% of the principal amount present, given the 
same quorum of 66⅔% of the outstanding principal 
amount of the affected debt securities or, in the case 
of a written resolution, from 66⅔% to 50% of the 
affected debt securities. Such a rule would be planned 
into the fundamental reform of collective action 
clauses which, like the proposed reform of the bond 
terms, is a prerequisite for the procedure described 
here.11 See Deutsche Bundesbank, Approaches to strength-

on the risk premiums of the member states. An 
orderly procedure reduces the uncertainties for 
investors in terms of the necessary steps and 
the intervening period until fundamental sus -
tainability has been restored, and curbs the 
costs of the coordination problems. This should 
make a more reliable calculation of the risk of 
loss possible, and the proposed reforms should 
expedite the process as a whole, thereby redu-
cing the economic costs of an overindebted 
government and thus, as a general tendency, 
any necessary haircut. If such a procedure were 
to result in an increase in risk premiums, for in -
stance if a bail-  out by the other member states 
were deemed less likely after such a reform had 
been introduced, this would have to be viewed 
as a correction of previously distorted market 
pricing, as such a bail-  out is not envisaged  
under the existing framework of the EMU. This 
would, in turn, counteract excessive debt accu-
mulation and prevent costs potentially   b eing 
passed on to other member states. If this were 
to lead to sounder public finances   over all, lower risk premiums could even be expected in 
future.
Conclusion
No fundamental changes have been made to the governance framework of the EMU since 
the outbreak of the financial and sovereign 
debt crisis, but the current framework remains 
in need of reform. In this context, there seems 
to be a lack of consensus for further develop -
ing the EMU into a real fiscal or political union. 
Therefore, the EMU should be further de -
veloped within its originally agreed framework. Safeguarding financial stability plays a key role 
in this context, particularly with regard to the 
negative interplay between sovereigns and 
financial   institutions.
Changes in the terms of the member states’ 
sovereign bonds could make an important con -
tribution, particularly with regard to tackling Reforms must 
enhance gov-ernance frame-work and finan-cial stability
Adjustments to 
bond terms facilitate future crisis resolutionwhether or not it involves a debt restructur-
ing. There is thus no way to rule out that 
the need for a (further) restructuring only 
becomes apparent during or at the end of 
an adjustment programme. If the debt sus-
tainability and capital market access of the 
country in question were not restored by 
the end of the programme’s duration, des-
pite the agreed measures being imple-
mented in full, (renewed) restructuring ne-
gotiations would be the only way forward. These should likewise be conducted accord-ing to a standardised process in order to es-
tablish sustainable public fi  nances in line 
with the agreed procedure and within the 
set time period given as an example. This process would also include those claims that were already extended under the ad-justment programme or that had already 
suffered losses during a previous restructur-ing. If, during this process, the ESM negoti-
ates a new adjustment programme for which it proposes fi  nancial assistance, it would have to be ensured that, in the re-structuring, the outstanding debt securities are substituted such that their maturities ex-
ceed the estimated programme duration, and the creditors thus remain liable. If a 
liquidity  problem is identifi  ed once more, a 
maturity extension could be deemed suffi   -
cient. Only then, at the latest, would the action no longer constitute an extension 
agreed in the bond terms, but a restructur-
ing. If no agreement were reached, the ESM would have to recommend that the Board of Governors reject the granting of additional fi  nancial assistance. Restructur-ing negotiations would then have to be 
conducted without the participation of the ESM.Deutsche Bundesbank

future sovereign debt crises. An automatic ma -
turity extension if financial assistance is granted 
by the ESM and a single-  limb majority r equire -
ment for debt restructuring could be included 
in the bond terms. This could alleviate the 
problem of diagnosing acute government 
financing   p roblems, strengthen investors’ indi -
vidual responsibility, boost the clout of the ESM and curb the transfer of risk to the other mem-
ber states, which, in turn, could facilitate an 
agreement on any debt restructuring.
If it is agreed in advance how to proceed in the 
event of a debt restructuring – and particularly 
if this is linked to the proposed changes to the 
bond terms – this could expedite the process 
and make it more predictable. In this context, 
the coordination and associated tasks, such 
as recording the existing claims, could be given 
to the ESM and, if there is a vote in favour of 
debt restructuring, the latter could also be 
tasked with an adjustment programme and 
ESM financial   assistance. If the crisis resolution 
mechanism is strengthened, it could further -
more also be considered whether, over and 
above this, the ESM should be assigned the 
function of an independent fiscal authority. The 
tasks of assessing budgetary developments and 
compliance with the fiscal rules, which have up 
to now been the remit of the European Com -
mission, could be transferred to this fiscal au-
thority. Overall, the cost and level of any future 
haircut could thus be reduced. However, since under the existing governance framework of 
the EMU the decision-  making powers for finan -
cial and economic policy continue to lie with 
the member states, even once a debt restruc -
turing procedure has been set up, its success 
would crucially hinge on the member states’ 
willingness to pay and cooperate.
The proposed reforms could consequently help 
to strengthen the no-  bail-  out principle in the 
euro area and the member states’ individual re -
sponsibility, and thus also render future sover -
eign debt crises less likely. The key elements 
would be implemented gradually, rather than 
on an ad hoc basis, by adjusting the bond con -
tracts of new issues. This would strengthen the 
crisis resolution mechanism outlined above. However, this mechanism does not present a 
direct or simple solution for the member states’ 
– in some cases – still very high sovereign debt, 
and the problems of a possible need for debt 
restructuring during the transitional period 
would also only be alleviated gradually. Overall, 
the member states should therefore use the 
time available to implement the consolidation 
course that has already been agreed and make 
their public finances more crisis-  r esilient. At the 
same time, it is crucial to introduce reforms aimed at increasing financial market stability, 
which not least break the nexus between na -
tional government finances and the banking 
system while making the restructuring of sover -
eign bonds a viable option.Rule-  bound

Bank recovery and resolution – the new 
TLAC and MREL minimum requirements
The new bank recovery and resolution regime introduced in Europe at the beginning of 2015 is 
designed to ensure the orderly resolvability of even systemically important institutions without 
endangering financial stability or exposing taxpayers to losses. Resolution, the thinking goes, can 
preserve those functions of a bank that have a bearing on the real economy and financial stabil -
ity, making it a credible alternative to normal insolvency proceedings or government bail-  out  
measures. A key element of the new resolution regime is the bail-  in tool, whic h makes it possible, 
for the first time, for holders of non-  subor dinated debt instruments to be exposed to bank losses 
outside insolvency proceedings, alongside the institution’s shareholders and subordinated credit -
ors. While it would be possible in principle to bail in all of a bank’s liabilities, some exemptions are permitted to ensure that the resolution objectives can be achieved. These exemptions include 
deposits covered by a deposit guarantee scheme (up to €100,000) and short-  term liabilities. To 
make sure that banks nonetheless have sufficient “bail-  inable” c apital, global and European bod -
ies have developed or already enshrined in law minimum standards for bail-  inable liabilities  
which institutions are required to hold. At the G20 level, a new minimum requirement for total 
loss- absorbing c apacity (TLAC) will come into force in 2019 for global systemically important 
banks (G-  SIBs). Onc e transposed into European law, the TLAC standard will set forth binding 
requirements governing matters including the amount and eligibility of liabilities as well as other 
aspects (eg the distribution of loss-  absorbing c apacity within groups, rules for investments by 
other banks in TLAC). At the same time, the European Union has already introduced a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) under the Bank Recovery and Resolution 
Directive (BRRD). MREL will be set by the resolution authorities on a firm-  specific basis according 
to certain rules, making it a more flexible tool in terms of the amount and eligibility of instruments to be held.Deutsche Bundesbank

Introduction
In the course of the financial crisis, govern -
ments channelled large sums of taxpayers’ 
money into ailing financial institutions in an ef -
fort to prevent them from failing and setting 
off a chain reaction. Yet government bail-  outs 
not only come at a substantial fiscal expense 
(which is ultimately shouldered by the taxpayer) 
but also give rise to negative incentive effects. 
As a case in point, there have been instances 
where some of the responsible bank managers 
took on excessive risk, safe in the knowledge 
that any losses they incurred would be picked 
up by government thanks to the existence of 
implicit government guarantees (known as 
moral hazard). This is a major issue, particularly 
where systemically important banks are con -
cerned (which are said to be “too big to fail”1), 
because subjecting them to normal insolvency 
proceedings can have an undesirable impact 
on financial stability and the real economy.
As a result, the G20 heads of state and govern -
ment agreed back in 2008 that global reform 
initiatives were needed to avert future disloca -
tions. The reforms focused on two areas. First, 
on strengthening the resilience of financial in -
stitutions as a way of reducing the likelihood of 
a crisis, and on curbing systemic risk (Basel  III  
framework2). This topic was addressed by re -
quiring banks to improve the quality and quan -
tity of the capital they hold, and by introducing 
quantitative liquidity standards and a non-  risk-  
based leverage ratio.3 Second, a dedicated 
resolution regime was developed for systemic -
ally important financial institutions4 which, un-
like normal insolvency proceedings, aims to 
ensure   the continuity of a bank’ s critical func -
tions in resolution and thus preserve financial 
stability. The introduction of dedicated reso -
lution regimes for financial institutions as a 
credible alternative to insolvency proceedings 
is intended to put a stop to governments’ cur -
rent tendency to systematically bail out system -
ically important financial institutions and go a 
long way towards resolving the too big to fail 
problem.This was the backdrop against which the G20 
mandated the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to 
draft an international standard for resolution regimes. The FSB’s efforts culminated in the publication, in 2011, of the Key Attributes of 
Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Insti -
tutions5 (Key Attributes) which, for the first 
time at the global level, outline the essential features that should be part of resolution re -
gimes in all jurisdictions. These Key Attributes 
require jurisdictions to establish resolution au -
thorities and give them resolution powers and 
tools, such as the new bail-  in tool that al lows 
them to allocate losses to creditors as well as 
the power to sell an institution’s business lines 
or transfer them to a bridge institution. In the 
EU, the basic principles of the Key Attributes for 
banks were transposed into European law by 
way of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Dir -
ective6 (BRRD). EU member states were re -Lessons from

1 An institution is deemed to be systemically important if its 
insolvency would severely impair the functioning of the 
financial   system or significant parts ther eof, and also have 
negative effects on the real economy. While “too big to fail”, 
in the stricter sense of the term, refers to a bank’s size, it is 
used here in a broader sense to refer to systemically import -
ant institutions as a whole, regardless of whether their sys -
temic importance is down to their size, complexity, intercon -
nectedness or other characteristics. The problem boils down 
to a government’s unwillingness to let a too big to fail insti -
tution fail and its use of public funds to bail it out.
2 The Basel  III fr amework agreed upon by the Basel Com -
mittee on Banking Supervision in September 2010 builds 
upon, and gradually replaces, the Basel  II rulebook (see  
Deutsche Bundesbank (2011), Basel  III – Leitfaden zu den 
neuen Eigenkapital- und Liquiditätsregeln für Banken). 
These standards were implemented in the EU by way of the 
CRR and CRD  IV legislation. F or more information, see 
Deutsche Bundesbank, Implementing Basel  III in Eur opean 
and national law, Monthly Report, June 2013, pp 55-71.3
 The leverage ratio is a bank’s Tier  1 capital divided by its 
leverage ratio exposure. Unlike the risk-  b ased capital re -
quirements, the individual exposures counted towards the 
leverage ratio are not individually risk-  weighted but instead 
included as unweighted numbers. For more information, 
see Deutsche Bundesbank (2013), op cit.4 For further information on the new resolution regime for 
banks, see Deutsche Bundesbank, Europe’s new recovery 
and resolution regime for credit institutions, Monthly Re -

quired to transpose the BRRD into national law 
by 1  January 2015 (and the bail-  in  tool by 
1 January 2016). For member states that par -
ticipate in the banking union, the BRRD was 
flanked by the Single Resolution Mechanism 
Regulation,7 which aims to create a level play -
ing field for the resolution of failing cross-  
border banks that fall within the scope of the 
Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM).
The bail-  in tool is integr al to the new resolution 
regime and one of the most important tools 
available to resolution authorities in a crisis. It is 
based on the idea that investors should not 
only benefit from a bank’s profits but also be 
exposed to any losses it incurs. This principle of 
liability creates stronger incentives to properly 
consider risks when making investment deci -
sions and to minimise moral hazard behaviour. 
Once shareholders have been bailed in,8 hold-
ers of debt instruments will also be exposed to 
losses according to the hierarchy of creditors 
(liability cascade) by writing down the liabilities 
in question or converting them into equity. 
However, bail-  in tool effectiveness and the  
overall credibility of a resolution regime hinge 
on firms having sufficient capacity to absorb 
losses in resolution. While it is possible in prin -
ciple for an institution’s entire equity and liabil-ities to be bailed in, the BRRD contains a num-
ber of general and discretionary exceptions to 
ensure that the resolution objectives are 
achieved.9 These exceptions were deemed ne -
cessary because bailing in certain liabilities 
could pose a threat to financial stability (eg 
bank runs) or because it may be difficult to 
value some instruments in a timely fashion, 
thereby impeding efforts to expose all instru-
ments ranking pari passu  to loss. To nonethe -
less ensure that a minimum level of loss-  
absorbing capacity is reliably available in reso -
lution, minimum requirements were developed 
for loss-  absorbing liabilities.
At the global level, the total loss-  absorbing  
capacity (TLAC) standard10 for global systemic-
ally important banks (G-  SIBs) was developed by 
the FSB and published in November 2015. The idea behind this standard is to define a min -
imum volume of loss-  absorbing liabilities that  
the roughly 30 G-  SIBs worldwide need to hold 
in case they run into difficulties so that they can 
be resolved in an orderly manner without re -
course to public funds. The FSB’s TLAC stand -
ard still needs to be transposed into European 
law, and the European Commission is expected 
to present a proposal this autumn. The BRRD, 
on the other hand, already contains a provision 
that shares broadly the same objective: the minimum requirement for own funds and eli -
gible liabilities (MREL). Like TLAC, MREL is de -
signed to ensure that each bank has a certain 
amount of loss-  absorbing capacity in case it  
needs to be resolved. Since the BRRD applies to 
all banks11 in the European Union, institutions Bail- in tool

Article 59 BRRD (implemented in section 89 of the Act on 
the Recovery and Resolution of Institutions and Financial   
Groups (Gesetz zur Sanierung und Abwicklung von Insti -

broadly similar without being a resolution tool in the true 
sense (see Deutsche Bundesbank (2014), op cit, p  31, 
pp 38-39).9 Article 44 (2) BRRD (implemented in section 91 (2) of the 
Act on the Recovery and Resolution of Institutions and 
 Financial Groups) lists a number of liabilities that are gener -
ally excluded from the bail-  in rule, including cover ed de -
posits, secured liabilities and liabilities with a remaining 
maturity of less than seven days. Furthermore, Article 44 (3) BRRD (implemented in section 91 (3) of the Act on the Re -
covery and Resolution of Institutions and Financial Groups) 
allows the resolution authority, in exceptional cases and 
subject to certain conditions, to exclude or partially exclude certain eligible liabilities, or certain categories thereof, from 
the scope of application of the bail-  in, such as in cases  
where their exclusion is strictly necessary and proportion -
ate to avoid giving rise to contagion.

EU, that is, credit institutions and investment firms (Art -

the term “credit institution” refers to deposit-  taking and

satisfy the broader definition set forth under German law 
(section 1 (1) of the German Banking Act (Kreditwesen -

throughout the EU must satisfy the MREL 
standard.
Though both TLAC and MREL share the same 
objective, their different backgrounds and 
scopes of application set them apart in a num -
ber of important ways (inter alia their levels 
and the notion of subordination as a criterion 
for eligibility) which are explored in greater de-
tail in the following.Total-  loss absorbing  
capacity – TLAC
Development of the TLAC 
standard
In the course of concretising the Key Attributes, 
it became clear that, because G-  SIBs oper ate 
across various jurisdictions, they must have suf-
ficient group-  wide capacity to absorb losses to 
ensure that a cross-  bor der resolution is effect -
ive. At the St Petersburg Summit in September 
2013, the G20 finally called on the FSB to as -
sess and develop proposals by the end of 2014 
on the adequacy of G-  SIBs’ loss-  absorbing cap -
acity when they fail. The FSB was asked to draft 
a new minimum requirement that went be -
yond the existing Basel  III fr amework, which ex -
pects banks to cover unexpected losses on a 
going-  concern basis,12 by requiring institutions 
to have additional loss-  absorbing and r ecapital -
isation capacity in a gone-  concern (ie reso -
lution) scenario as well. While going-  concern  
capital is made up entirely of own funds, gone-  
concern capital can also comprise liabilities that 
can be converted in the course of a bail-  in. The 
FSB lead-  managed the work on the new stand -
ard, but it liaised closely with the Basel Com -
mittee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) to ad -
dress technical issues and ensure compatibility 
with the Basel  III framework.
Besides overarching principles, the TLAC stand-
ard13 also includes a Term Sheet containing

SIBs in two stages (from 2019 and from 2022).14
Scope of application and 
 calibration
The new TLAC standard represents a minimum 
requirement for G-  SIBS that stil l needs to be 
transposed into European law. Resolution au -
thorities also have the option of levying an 
institution-  specific add-  on on top of minimum 
TLAC, as in the case of minimum regulatory 
capital requirements. The question of imposing 
mandatory minimum TLAC on all G-  SIBs pr oved 
to be a controversial topic during negotiations, 
however. While some FSB members called for a 
binding minimum requirement from the outset, 
others backed a more flexible solution that 
gives the competent authorities a greater de -
gree of discretionary leeway. In terms of finan -
cial stability and competitiveness, however, a 
mandatory minimum requirement is to be wel -
comed.
TLAC essentially comprises an institution’s en -
tire going-  concern and gone-  concern capital 
with the exception of the equity capital that in -
stitutions need to satisfy their buffer require -
ments (ie the combined buffer requirement15). 
The Common Equity Tier 1 capital needed to satisfy the buffer requirement cannot also be 
counted towards TLAC and thus be used twice, 
since that might impair the way the buffer 
works; the buffer is supposed to “breathe” 
–  that is, be run down in stress situations  – 
while minimum TLAC must be adhered to at all 
times. Otherwise, a G-  SIB that uses its buffer to 
cover losses would thus fall short of minimum 
TLAC. To prevent this scenario from materialis-
ing, institutions have to hold buffer capital in 
addition to minimum TLAC. Sequencing the 
different requirements in this order ensures 
that the sanction mechanism that is activated 
when an institution falls short of the buffer re-
quirement remains intact: if a G-  SIB no longer 
has sufficient CET1 capital to meet the buffer 
requirement, it can be forced, for instance, to 
present a capital conservation plan and limit its 
distributions of dividends or payments of vari -
able remuneration. If that institution’s CET1 capital continues to be depleted and it ultim -
ately falls short of minimum TLAC, or is likely to 
do so in the foreseeable future, the TLAC TLAC standard

14 An exception is made for G-  SIBs in emer ging market 
economies (though this only applies to China at the current 
time), which will need to comply with TLAC at the latest 
from 2025 and 2028, respectively.
15 In the EU, the combined buffer requirement can consist 
of the following buffers: capital conservation buffer, coun -
tercyclical capital buffer, buffer for global or other system -
ically important institutions and systemic risk buffer. For

standard requires the same sanction mechan -
isms to be activated as when minimum regula -
tory capital requirements are (likely to be) 
breached. Sanctions include early intervention 
measures; as a last resort, a breach of min -
imum TLAC can, however, also trigger an insti -
tution’s resolution.
The level of minimum TLAC was finalised fol -
lowing comprehensive impact assessment stud -
ies and should, at the very least, allow for the 
following criteria. Assuming a firm has 
exhausted   its going-  concern capital when it  
enters resolution, sufficient capacity should be 
available to absorb any losses still remaining 
and enable a successor institution16 to be recap-
italised in the amount of at least 8% of RWAs. 
This target level is deemed to be the least a suc -
cessor institution needs to achieve to meet the 
minimum regulatory capital conditions for au -
thorisation. In addition, that institution also 
needs to hold a capital buffer that is sufficient 
to create market confidence. At the same time, 
however, resolution should not lead to a failed 
institution being “resurrected”; the main reso -
lution objectives here are to preserve the con -
tinuity of critical functions, shield client assets 
and minimise the impact on financial stability.
Minimum TLAC will be introduced in two steps. 
According to this standard, from 2019, G-  SIBs  
will be required to maintain TLAC amounting to 
at least 16% of their RWAs and to 6% of the 
Basel  III lever age ratio denominator (hereinafter 
referred to as the leverage ratio), whichever is 
higher. From 2022, the requirement will in -
crease to 18% of RWAs or 6.75% of the lever -
age ratio. The final requirement is thus at the 
lower end of the range proposed during con -
sultation with the banking industry and the 
general public. This is due to the restraining in -
fluence of some members of the FSB as well as 
to the results of impact assessment studies. The scenarios involving higher target levels revealed 
considerable shortfalls for several institutions. Nevertheless, the Bundesbank believes that 
with a longer transitional phase, for example, 
higher minimum TLAC would indeed have been possible and desirable in terms of financial sta-
bility. After all, increasing the loss-  absorbing  
capacity of global systemically important insti -
tutions would be more helpful in terms of 
achieving orderly resolution. In Switzerland, for example, far stricter requirements will apply to 
systemically important financial institutions from 2019. After this date, they will have to 
hold a total capital ratio17 of 28.6% of RWAs or 
10% of the leverage ratio. Of this, 14.3% of RWAs or 5% of the leverage ratio must be in 
the form of subordinated bail-  in instruments.
The calibration parameters are based on two 
variables (RWAs or the leverage ratio, which -
ever is higher) because the calculation of TLAC 
should take into account both the bank’s risk 
(measured by RWAs) and a component that is 
independent of the risk measurement (meas -
ured using the leverage ratio). On the one 
hand, institutions with higher risk levels should 
be subject to a higher minimum TLAC require -
ment. On the other, the recent crisis has shown 
that RWAs do not always prove a reliable vari -
able for measuring risk and thus for calculating 
minimum regulatory capital requirements. This 
is why the Basel  III fr amework already includes 
the leverage ratio, a variable that is independ-
ent of risk measurement and whose denomin-ator is now used to calculate minimum TLAC.
Eligibility criteria for TLAC 
 instruments
Besides the calibration of minimum TLAC, it is 
also important to identify which instruments 
can reliably be exposed to losses in the event of 
a crisis, or, in other words, can be bailed in 
with legal certainty (TLAC instruments18). Based Criteria for

on the assumption that the minimum regula -
tory capital is intended to help absorb losses in 
a going-  concern scenario, it can gener ally be 
counted towards TLAC. However, other eligible 
debt components (TLAC liabilities) must meet 
certain criteria. Here, experience has shown 
that the class of non-  subor dinated liabilities 
(senior liabilities) contains a large number of very different instruments which, however, 
rank pari passu  in the insolvency hierarchy of 
most countries. These include, for example, in-
struments such as unsecured debt securities, 
which are well-  s uited to bail-  i ns, but also in -
struments that, if used to absorb losses, could 
cause problems owing to their importance to 
the real economy (such as covered deposits of 
large enterprises) or their complexity (such as 
certain derivatives). While it would therefore make sense for the resolution authority to be 
able to differentiate between these different in -
struments in a bail-  in, ther e is no straightfor -
ward way to do so because of the pari passu  
principle, under which liabilities belonging to 
the same class must be treated equally. The 
BRRD also includes the “no creditor worse off” 
(NCWO) principle,19 which states that creditors 
should not incur greater losses through reso -
lution than if the institution had been wound 
up under normal insolvency proceedings, 
otherwise the affected creditors would have to 
be compensated for the difference from the 
resolution fund.
Because of the risk of breaching the NCWO principle and the financial burden this would 
entail, treating non-  subor dinated liabilities that 
rank pari passu  differently in a bail-  in event is 
not expedient and hence unlikely. However, 
this means that a number of instruments with 
loss- a bsorbing potential cannot be bailed in 
with legal certainty. Some of these problems 
have already been addressed in the context of 
the BRRD.20 Nonetheless, national insolvency 
regimes are still very heterogeneous and are 
not harmonised, meaning that any change to 
the insolvency hierarchy aimed at differenti -
ation within the class of non-  s ubordinated 
liabilities   would have to take place at the na -tional level. A number of countries have now 
adapted their national insolvency regimes to 
reduce the potential legal risks arising from the NCWO principle and also to increase the effect-
iveness of the bail-  in tool (see the chart on  
page 71). In Germany, for instance, the add -
ition of paragraphs (5) to (7) of section 46 f of the Banking Act will change the order in which 
liabilities   ar e ranked in the event of bank insolv -
encies with effect from 1 January 2017. In the 
non- su bordinated liabilities class, creditors’ 
claims arising from certain unsecured, non-  
structured debt instruments will then only be 
met after claims arising from all other non-  
subordinated liabilities pursuant to section 38 
of the German Insolvency Code have been sat -
isfied. This change means that, when resolving 
a bank, eligible liabilities in the class of non-  
subordinated liabilities can now be bailed in 
first to absorb losses without the risk of breach -
ing the NCWO principle.
Because certain instruments are more suited to 
covering losses than others, liabilities which 
would be very likely to cause problems if bailed 
in should not be eligible as TLAC. The following 
liabilities are therefore not TLAC-  eligible.
– Covered deposits, sight deposits and short-  
term deposits (deposits with an original ma -
turity of less than one year)
– Liabilities arising from derivatives and debt 
instruments with derivative-  linked featur es, 
such as structured notes
– Liabilities arising other than through a con -
tract (such as tax liabilities)Liabilities

exempts covered deposits (ie deposits of up to €100,000) from being bailed in, eligible deposits (ie deposits of above 
€100,000) of natural persons and small and medium-  sized 
enterprises (SMEs) have a preferential ranking in the liability 
cascade to other non-  subor dinated liabilities (see the chart 
on page 70). Furthermore, the resolution authority can ex -

– Any liabilities that, under the applicable law, 
are excluded from bail-  in or cannot be writ -

To be eligible, however, TLAC liabilities must 
have certain characteristics. This is primarily to 
ensure that, in the event of a resolution, TLAC 
is actually available and can be used to cover losses. Thus, for example, TLAC liabilities must 
be unsecured and, as a general rule, issued by 
the resolution entity.21 They must have a min -
imum residual maturity of one year and must 
not contain any put options that are exercis -
able by the investor.

While there has been general consensus from 
the beginning regarding most of the above-  
mentioned criteria, the question of the manda-
tory, explicit subordination of TLAC liabilities 
has been the subject of controversial debate. 
The argument against the mandatory subordin -
ation of TLAC liabilities is that it would increase 
the complexity of the liabilities structure and 
introduce a new capital class. In addition, some 
banks have issued large volumes of Tier  2 in-
struments with very long maturities and con -
tractual clauses that forbid the issuance of fur -
ther subordinated capital which would take 
priority over these instruments in the event of 
an insolvency. On the other hand, the argu -ment in favour of mandatory subordination is 
that this would ensure that such liabilities could 
be used for loss absorption and recapitalisation 
without risk of legal challenge – that is, with -
out conflicting with the NCWO principle. In this 
context, it is particularly important that poten-tial investors are able to clearly differentiate be-
tween and identify these instruments so they 
can determine their position in the liability cas -
cade. Transparency regarding the insolvency ranking and balance sheet classification of 
TLAC instruments ensures that their risks can 
be priced appropriately.Subordination of 
TLAC liabilitiesAdjustments to national insolvency regimes
1 In Germany, from 1 January 2017, pursuant to section 46f (5) to (7) of the German Banking Act, a new “subordination in the senior 
class” rule will apply to certain senior instruments under insolvency law. Consequently, creditors of certain unsecured, non-structured debt instruments issued by banks will rank junior to other non-subordinated liabilities that previously belonged to the same creditor class. 2 In France, a legislative proposal establishing a new contractually subordinated creditor class within the “senior debt” class 
(“standard senior” / “non-preferred senior”) is currently being discussed. The class would be positioned between preferred senior debt and subordinated liabilities and would include non-structured liabilities with a maturity of over one year. 3 At the start of 2019, Italy 
will give general preferential treatment to all deposits over other unsecured liabilities according to its Insolvency Act. This approach, too, generally allows other unsubordinated creditors to be bailed in without infringing the NCWO principle. 4 In the context of the 
transposition of the BRRD into national legislation, in November 2015, Spain introduced a new creditor class which includes contractu-ally subordinated liabilities which are not recognised as AT1 or Tier 2 (“Tier 3”). The objective of the rule is to strengthen contractual subordination clauses.

Ultimately, the FSB standard chose the follow -
ing compromise: TLAC liabilities must generally 
be subordinated to liabilities excluded from 
TLAC (meaning, in particular, certain deposits, 
derivatives and other operational liabilities). 
This can be achieved in three ways – “statutory 
subordination”, “contractual subordination” or 
“structural subordination” (see the table on 
page 73). In addition, a number of exemptions 
have been included to take into account the 
specific structures of the financial system in in -
dividual FSB member states. Under certain cir -
cumstances, for example, liabilities that meet 
all TLAC criteria except the subordination re-
quirement can be counted as TLAC instruments to a value of 2.5% of RWAs (or 3.5% of RWAs from 2022). This is aimed, in particular, at juris -
dictions in which banks rely heavily on non-  
subordinated liabilities (eg traditional bank 
bonds) for refinancing in the event of insolv -
ency. Furthermore, if the amount of liabilities 
excluded from TLAC that rank pari passu with 
TLAC-  eligible instruments is limited, an exemp -
tion to the subordination requirement can be 
made (“de minimis  allowance”).22 All in all, the 
exemptions are a dilution of the subordination 
requirement.
Distribution of TLAC within the 
group (parents/subsidiaries)
As a general rule, several supervisory and reso -
lution authorities are responsible for supervis -
ing and resolving a cross-  bor der G-  SIB: the au -
thorities in the home country, which are re -
sponsible for the resolution entity, and the 
authorities   in the host country , which are re -
sponsible for supervising the institution’s for -
eign subsidiaries. To facilitate cooperation be -
tween the home and host authorities and to 
ensure that sufficient loss-  a bsorbing capacity 
is available in the right place if a cross-  bor der 
G- SIB enters r esolution, the FSB standard also 
specifies how TLAC is to be distributed within a 
cross-  bor der group (internal TLAC). This distri -
bution of loss-  absorbing capacity depends, in 
particular, on which resolution strategy23 a group has chosen: single point of entry (SPE) or 
multiple point of entry (MPE). Under the SPE 
strategy, it is assumed that, in resolution, the 
shareholders and external creditors of the par -
ent (generally a non-  oper ating holding com -
pany) will be the first to bear the losses. The 
creditors of the operating subsidiary should be 
protected, provided that the parent has suffi -
cient TLAC. The parent institution should there -
fore pre-  position a shar e of its TLAC instru -
ments to its material subsidiaries24 abroad (or 
to the sub-  g roup if the subsidiary has further 
subsidiaries), so that the material foreign sub -
sidiaries issue TLAC instruments, which are then held by the parent and recorded in the 
balance sheet accordingly (by implication, in -
ternal TLAC represents a claim of the parent in -
stitution vis-  à-  vis its subsidiary). In this way , if 
the subsidiary encounters difficulties – once the 
loss- absorbing capacity of the equity holdings  
of the parent have been exhausted – the claims 
of the parent vis-  à-  vis the subsidiary ar e used 
before other creditors must bear losses. In the 
event of resolution, this allows the subsidiary’s 
losses to be passed on to the parent institution. 
The resolution tools are then applied at the 
level of the parent institution, while the sub -
sidiary’s core business areas and critical func -
tions are preserved during the resolution pro -
ceedings. The MPE strategy would involve 
maintaining an appropriate   TL AC amount for 
each individual resolution entity, each of which 
then distributes internal TLAC within its reso -
lution group.Distribution of 
TLAC in an inter-national group depends on resolution 
 
strategy
22 According to section 11 of the FSB Term Sheet, the sub -
ordination requirement is not mandatory unless the 
amount of excluded liabilities that rank pari passu or junior 
to the TLAC instruments exceeds 5% of the institution’s 
TLAC instruments.
23 For more information, see FSB (2013), op cit.
24 According to section 17 of the FSB Term Sheet, a sub -

Rules to prevent contagion 
 effects
The TLAC standard is intended to improve the 
resolvability of G-  SIBs, thus helping to achieve  
orderly resolutions without endangering finan-
cial stability. It is therefore necessary to limit the 
extent to which banks invest in other banks’ 
TLAC instruments. If TLAC instruments are held by other banks, this strengthens the ties within 
the banking sector and can, in a bail-  in, lead to 
contagion effects at other banks. The plan to 
extend the deduction rules25 already in force 
under the Basel  III fr amework for investments in 
regulatory own funds to TLAC liabilities is in -
tended to prevent such systemic effects. In 
future  , both G-  SIBs and other international ly 
active banks should therefore deduct their in -
vestments in third-  party TL AC liabilities above a 
certain percentage (as the debate stands) from 
their own Tier  2 capital. The exemption limit 
would also leave a certain amount of leeway 
for necessary market-  making activities. A t the 
same time, however, it would be strict enough 
to largely limit reciprocal investments in TLAC, 
thus preventing greater interconnectedness 
within the banking sector.Enhanced disclosure 
 requirements
In the context of the aforementioned subordin -
ation and deduction rules, the enhanced dis -
closure requirements under the TLAC standard 
play a prominent role. Transparency about 
TLAC-  eligible instruments is vital to enable risks 
to be priced accurately and to generate suffi -
cient market demand for new issuances of 
TLAC instruments. This is the only way to en -
sure that market participants can correctly as -
sess the risks they are taking and hence make 
sound investment decisions. From 2019, G-  SIBs 
must therefore disclose detailed information 
about the volume, maturity and composition of 
external and internal TLAC, and about instru-
ments that, under the applicable insolvency 
law, rank pari passu or junior to TLAC.
Improved disclosure requirements are also de -
sirable from the point of view of investors and 
rating agencies. They have expressed concerns 
that the complexity of the new rules could ul -
timately undermine their effectiveness if invest -
ors are no longer clear about their own pos -
ition in the hierarchy of creditors owing to the Constraints on 
reciprocal investment by banks in TLAC instruments to prevent risks to financial stabilityDetailed disclos-
ure requirements for G-
 SIBS 
as of 
2019The three methods of subordination under the TLAC standard
 
Structural subordination Contractual subordination Statutory subordination
Structural subordination is based on the role 
of the issuer in the corporate structure. It occurs when issuers function purely as hold-ing companies which transfer capital to the operating subsidiaries and, at the same time, generate their revenue mainly from the dividend payments of the subsidiaries. Because all debt obligations of the subsid-iaries must be serviced fi  rst in the case of  insolvency before funds can be channelled to the holding company, the creditors of the holding company are subordinated in structural terms.The creditor and issuer contractually agree that, in the case of insolvency, interest and principal payments can only be made on these liabilities once other, more senior  liabilities have been serviced in full.Statutory subordination is established through a statutory provision in national  insolvency regimes. The legislation would state that, in the case of insolvency, interest and principal payments may only be paid on certain liabilities once other, more senior liabilities have been serviced in full.

different regulatory and legal approaches to 
bank resolution.
Further timetable
At the beginning of this year, the European 
Commission established a technical working 
group to discuss the transposition of TLAC into 
European law as well as potential amendments 
to the BRRD in terms of MREL. The working 
group is due to submit its proposals by mid-
2016. Taking into account these findings, the 
European Commission plans to propose a legal 
act by the end of the year.
Minimum requirement  
for own funds and eligible 
 liabilities (MREL)
While the TLAC standard was developed by the 
G20, the EU has already introduced a similar 
concept, MREL,26 by implementing the Key At -
tributes by way of the BRRD. This is to ensure 
that institutions that are established in the EU 
meet a minimum requirement for own funds 
and bail-  inable liabilities at all times. Unlike 
TLAC, which is based on RWAs, this require -
ment is expressed as a percentage of an institu -
tion’s total liabilities27 including regulatory cap-
ital (hereinafter referred to as total liabilities). 
Like TLAC, the aim of MREL is to ensure that an 
institution structures its liabilities such that a 
sufficient buffer of bail-  i nable capital is avail -
able for a resolution. MREL is to be set by the 
competent resolution authorities from 2016 in 
order to make the application of the bail-  in tool 
credible in practice.
Although both concepts cover the same ob -
jective, TLAC and MREL nevertheless differ in a 
number of key elements. There are two major 
reasons for this. First, MREL was already en -
shrined in the BRRD before the TLAC standard 
had been finalised. Second, because the two 
concepts have different scopes, they must be 
structured differently. While TLAC is explicitly designed for G-  SIBs, MREL is aimed at al l Euro -
pean institutions within the scope of the BRRD. 
This encompasses   a far lar ger range of institu -
tions, regardless of their size or systemic im -
portance. Since a uniform, binding minimum 
requirement such as TLAC was not considered 
effective given the heterogeneity of the Euro -
pean banking sector, the resolution authority is 
to set an individual MREL for each institution. 
When determining MREL, the resolution 
 authority will therefore take into account 
institution-  specific featur es and the principle of 
proportionality. Since the German banking sec -
tor consists of a large number of smaller insti -
tutions, it can be assumed that the resolution 
authority will probably envisage normal insolv -
ency proceedings rather than resolution for the majority of institutions. To ensure that MREL is 
set appropriately, the competent supervisory 
authority for the institution in question is also 
to be involved and must be consulted by the 
resolution authority before the MREL is set. This 
is beneficial since the supervisory authorities 
have specific knowledge and detailed informa-tion regarding the institutions.
Even though, for the above-  mentioned r ea-
sons, no minimum level has been legally de -
fined, the resolution authority nevertheless has 
to take into account certain qualitative criteria 
laid down in the BRRD28 when determining the 
MREL for each institution.

– In the event of a bail-  in, an institution must 
hold sufficient capital to absorb losses. In 
addition, sufficient capital has to be avail -
able for recapitalisation so that the succes -
sor institution can comply with the require -
ments necessary for authorisation. Further 
to this, a certain capital buffer should be 
maintained for restoring market confidence 
which, under ideal circumstances, makes it 
possible for the successor institution to refi -
nance itself following the resolution.
– If the resolution plan anticipates that, on an 
exceptional basis, certain classes of MREL-  
eligible liabilities might be excluded from 
bail- in, it must be ensur ed that sufficient 
other MREL-  eligible liabilities ar e available 
for a potential bail-  in.
– The size, business model, funding model 
and risk profile of the institution are to be 
taken into account.
– The MREL may be reduced if the deposit 
guarantee scheme is able to contribute to -
wards financing the resolution.
– The resolution authority should consider 
possible effects on financial stability that 
could arise from the institution’s failure. In 
order to avoid contagion effects, MREL must 
therefore be set higher for systemically im-
portant institutions than for institutions 
whose collapse is unlikely to adversely affect 
the stability of the financial system.
These qualitative criteria are further described 
and specified in the Regulatory Technical Stand -
ards (RTS) of the European Banking Authority 
(EBA). Following a three-  month public consult -
ation period, the RTS were adopted with 
amendments by the European Commission on 
23 May 2016.29
Despite the resolution authorities determining 
MREL on a case-  by-  case basis for each institu -
tion, the aim of the RTS is to ensure a compar -
able approach and consistent interpretation of the individual criteria amongst EU member 
states. Since RTS are immediately binding in the 
EU members states when they enter into force, 
these serve as a tool for achieving a harmon -
ised approach to determining MREL. However, 
it should be noted that RTS must not go beyond   
the provisions of the primary legislation – in 
this case, the BRRD. As the European Commis -
sion and the EBA differ on this matter, the European Commission has refrained from 
quantifying a required minimum level for the 
firm- specific MREL.
Loss absorption amount
The loss absorption amount is determined as a 
starting point based on the minimum capital 
requirements to be met under Basel  III.30 The 
background to this is that the minimum regula-
tory capital requirements already aim to cover 
unexpected losses incurred through ongoing 
business operations. The loss absorption 
amount for calculating MREL is thus composed 
of the minimum regulatory capital requirement 
(ie total capital ratio amounting to at least 8% 
of RWAs), the firm-  specific add-  on set by the  
supervisory authority, and the buffer require -
ment; alternatively, it may instead consist of the 
future leverage ratio requirement, should this 
be higher. Where justification is provided to the 
supervisory authority, the resolution authority 
may, under certain conditions, set a different 
loss absorption amount from the minimum 
capital requirements; for instance, if this is 
necessary   to remove obstacles to resolution (eg 
additional capital or liquidity needs that arise 
during the resolution process, continuity of crit -
ical functions, access to financial market infra-Loss absorption

odology for setting the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (Commission document No 
C(2016) 2976 final). This Regulation will enter into force,

structures). This is intended to prevent the reso -
lution authority from acting as a “shadow 
supervisor”. Where the resolution plan provides 
for the winding up of an institution under nor -
mal insolvency proceedings,31 MREL should 
merely correspond to the amount of the min -
imum regulatory capital requirement. Hence, 
such institutions do not need to hold additional 
capital or MREL-  e ligible liabilities in reserve in 
order to meet the MREL requirement.
Recapitalisation amount
If the resolution authority decides normal in -
solvency proceedings would not be appropri -
ate for achieving the resolution objectives and instead envisages a resolution in an institution’s 
resolution plan, this institution is also required 
to maintain a recapitalisation amount in add -
ition to the loss absorption amount. An institu -
tion’s recapitalisation amount is determined 
according to the resolution strategy set out in 
the resolution plan. As critical functions (ie 
those affecting the real economy and financial 
stability), such as lending and deposit business, 
are to be continued in the event of a resolution 
(eg by transferring them to a bridge institu -
tion), it is essential that the successor institu -
tion taking over these functions is sufficiently 
capitalised to establish itself in the market. At 
the very least, the institution must meet the minimum regulatory capital requirements ne -
cessary for authorisation amounting to 8% of 
RWAs, or the leverage ratio requirement, as 
well as a pre-  determined firm-  specific add-  on.  
Further to this, the successor institution – in 
addition to the minimum regulatory capital re -
quirements – should also comply with the buf-
fer requirement as well as maintaining a com -
parable level of equity capital (including buf -
fers) as similar institutions (ie its peer group). 
This therefore needs to be taken into account 
by the resolution authority when determining 
the recapitalisation amount.32 It is particularly 
important that the successor institution be ap-
propriately recapitalised so that it is considered 
solvent by the market, ie market participants have confidence in it and are prepared to con -
duct business with it.
Adjustments to MREL
Resolution planning plays a key role in deter -
mining both the loss absorption and the recap-
italisation amounts. In particular, the resolution 
authority specifies in the resolution plan which 
resolution tools33 should be used to achieve the 
resolution objectives. This decision has a major 
impact on the size of the recapitalisation 
amount, for example. When the bail-  in tool is  
to be applied, or when certain functions are to be transferred to a newly established bridge in -
stitution, the recapitalisation amount is likely to be set higher than in the case of a plan to sell the institution or parts thereof to one or more 
market participants. Moreover, resolution plan -
ning may reveal that certain classes of MREL-  
eligible liabilities might not be available at the 
time of resolution. This would be the case if, 
for example, in the context of resolution plan -
ning, the resolution authority determines that 
certain theoretically bail-  inable liabilities  
–  which are also MREL-  eligible liabilities – 
might, in exceptional cases, have to be ex -
cluded from bail-  in the event of a resolution.34 
Reasons for exclusion could be, for example, 
that it is not possible to bail in these liabilities 
within a reasonable timeframe or that the ex -
clusion is necessary to ensure the continuity of 
critical functions. The resolution authority must 
take this into account when determining MREL 
so that even after allowing for such exceptions, Recapitalisation 
amount is set depending on resolution strat -
egy outlined in resolution plan

sufficient MREL-  eligible liabilities ar e available 
on the whole for the resolution strategy’s im -
plementation.
By contrast, the resolution authority may re -
duce MREL if it can be assumed that the de -
posit guarantee scheme would contribute to -
wards financing the resolution. The background 
to this is the liability cascade outlined in the 
BRRD: since covered deposits are excluded 
from bail-  in, costs may potentially be borne by 
the responsible deposit guarantee schemes if 
they are required to make a cash contribution 
towards financing the resolution. The size of 
this contribution would then be the amount by 
which the covered deposits would have been 
written down had they not been excluded from 
bail- in.35 Therefore, a deposit guarantee 
scheme contribution can only be expected if it 
is likely, in the event of resolution, that the end 
of the liability cascade would be reached and 
the depositors would be relied on. However, for the majority of resolution cases, such a 
scenario is considered rather unlikely.
As a general rule, the resolution authority 
should take into account each institution’s 
business model and risk profile when determin -
ing MREL using, inter alia, information from 
the supervisory review and evaluation process 
(SREP). This serves as the basis for determining 
the institution-  s pecific prudential requirements 
and provides banking supervisors with a com -
mon framework for assessing an institution’s 
overall risk situation. Amongst other things, 
this should include analysing the business 
model, assessing the adequacy of internal con -
trol systems and risk management procedures, 
ensuring capital adequacy as well as assessing 
the institution’s liquidity and funding situation.
Given their size and significance for financial 
stability, particular attention is paid to institu -
tions within the SSM from which systemic risk 
would emanate in the event of their failure. 
Since – in the event of these institutions’ reso -
lution – it may be necessary to draw on the Single Resolution Fund (SRF), the resolution authority   should ensur e that the criteria for ac -
cessing the SRF are met when determining the 
MREL for systemically important institutions. 
For example, SRF contributions are only permis -
sible if shareholders and creditors have already 
contributed an amount equivalent to at least 
8% of the institution’s total liabilities to loss ab -
sorption and recapitalisation.36
Eligibility criteria
As with TLAC, both the volume and quality of 
eligible liabilities are important for MREL, since 
in the event of resolution, it needs to be en -
sured that MREL is actually available and that the resolution objectives can therefore be 
achieved. In view of this, European legislators 
have defined criteria which MREL-  eligible liabil -
ities must meet.37 The aim is to ensure that 
these liabilities are able to help absorb losses 
without any legal difficulties and, in particular, 
that bank runs and contagion effects are pre -
vented. In addition, it should be possible to 
evaluate MREL-  eligible liabilities r eliably and 
they should also be readily available at the time 
of resolution. To this effect – similarly to TLAC – 
covered deposits and the deposits of natural 
persons and small and medium-  sized enter -
prises in excess of the protection ceiling, as 
well as derivatives, for example, are not con -
sidered MREL-  eligible liabilities. F urthermore, 
MREL-  eligible instruments must not be collat -
eralised and have to have a residual maturity of 
at least one year. On the one hand, these cri -
teria ensure a certain quality of MREL-  e ligible 
liabilities; on the other, they provide for a min -
imum level of comparability and thus a level Requirements

eligible 
liabilities

Act on the Recovery and Resolution of Institutions and 
Financial   Groups.
36 In this context, for the majority of Germany’s systemic -
ally important institutions, it can be concluded that a re -
quirement of 8% of total liabilities is likely to be higher 
than the minimum TLAC of 18% of RWAs or 6.75% of the leverage ratio that will apply from 2022.

playing field between banks in the EU member 
states.
Determining MREL for German 
institutions
For institutions supervised directly by the ECB 
and for cross-  bor der groups for which the Sin -
gle Resolution Board (SRB) is directly respon -
sible in the context of the SRM, as well as in 
cases where member states have transferred 
this responsibility pursuant to Article 7 (5) of 
the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation,38 
MREL is determined by the SRB after consult -
ation with the competent supervisory author -
ities. The SRB communicates its decision to the 
national resolution authority (in Germany, the 
Financial Market Stabilisation Agency (FMSA)), 
which then implements the decision at the in -
stitution level. For the other institutions domi -
ciled in Germany, the FMSA sets MREL in con -
sultation with the Federal Financial Supervisory 
Authority (BaFin), based on any guidelines 
drawn up by the SRB to ensure the MREL re -
quirement is applied in a coherent manner 
throughout the banking union. Moreover, the 
SRB may issue general instructions to the 
 national resolution authorities.39
In order to set MREL, the resolution authorities 
must have a sufficient basis of information at 
their disposal. While limited data is already 
available in the existing reporting system, a 
large proportion of the data required has to be 
collected from scratch. The Bundesbank is in -
volved in the MREL setting process owing pri -
marily to its responsibility for the ongoing 
supervision of banks, which means it assists in 
providing and obtaining information, amongst 
other things.
Since the MREL requirement depends, inter 
alia, on the resolution strategy of the respect-
ive institution, MREL is determined in the con -
text of resolution planning. In the case of cross-  
border groups of institutions, collaboration 
within the resolution colleges40 is especially im-portant. The SRB and the FMSA, as well as the 
other national resolution authorities, are cur -
rently working intensively on preparing reso -
lution plans, with the first MREL requirements 
therefore likely to be determined for large 
banks in the EU initially. It is not yet known to 
what extent this is to be communicated pub -
licly. Even though the SRB stresses that a firm-  
specific decision is called for in the case of 
MREL, the MREL requirement of 8% of total 
 liabilities is considered the likely benchmark for 
all banks under SRB responsibility, since the SRF 
can only be used following a bail-  in of at least 
8% of an institution’s liabilities.
Outstanding issues
A number of key points concerning the appli -
cation of the new MREL requirement are cur -
rently still unresolved even following publica -
tion of the RTS and should be addressed as part 
of the European Commission’s planned legal 
act on the implementation of TLAC with a view 
to amending the BRRD.
– While it was stipulated for TLAC that the 
buffer requirement needs to be met in add-
ition to minimum TLAC, thus preventing 
double usage of CET1 capital, no such clari-
fication exists for MREL. Should it be pos -
sible for CET1 capital to be used to meet 
both the buffer requirement and the MREL 
requirement, the proper functioning of the 
buffers would no longer be ensured and a 
breach of MREL would occur before the buf-
fer requirement is breached. However, this 
would render the capital buffers ineffective, 
as they are intentionally placed ahead of the other capital requirements to allow them to 
“breathe” in times of stress, ie they are able SRB and FMSA

to be reduced, while the other capital re -
quirements, including the MREL require -
ment, have to be met at all times.
– Further to this, in a similar manner to TLAC, 
it should also be made clear in the MREL re -
quirements that if there is a (likely) MREL shortfall, the same consequences apply as when the minimum regulatory capital re -
quirements are undershot. Any further sanc-
tioning should also be defined in this con -
text.
– While there is a requirement for TLAC-  
eligible liabilities to be ranked junior to liabil -
ities excluded from TLAC, the same is not 
currently stipulated for MREL-  eligible liabil -
ities. This would, however, be desirable in order to ensure that the requirements in 
terms of MREL and the bail-  in tool ar e for-
mulated in an effective and legally sound manner and that there is greater transpar -
ency for market participants.
– The BRRD does not specify how institutions’ 
reciprocal investments in MREL-  eligible liabil -
ities are to be handled. However, such in -
vestments harbour risks of contagion, which 
– as is the case with TLAC – should be ad -
dressed by way of regulatory provisions.
Conclusion
One of the primary objectives of the reform ini-
tiatives in the wake of the recent financial crisis 
was to resolve the too big to fail problem. 
Amongst other things, it should be possible in 
future to resolve even systemically important 
institutions in an orderly manner without jeop -
ardising the stability of the financial system or 
burdening taxpayers. In this context, dedicated 
resolution regimes have been in place for banks 
since 2011 and an important step has thus 
been taken towards restoring the market econ-
omy principle of aligning liability and control. 
Notably, the bail-  in tool was intr oduced to 
make sure that losses are borne by sharehold-ers and creditors. As sufficient loss buffers are 
necessary to ensure the proper functioning and 
thus the credibility of the bail-  in tool, two new 
minimum requirements were developed for 
banks at both the global and European levels. 
One is the TLAC standard, which was adopted 
at the G20 level and is to be binding for all 
G-SIBs   fr om 2019. The other is MREL: an 
institution-  specific r equirement which will 
be  determined by the competent resolution 
 authorities for European institutions.
A look at the liability cascade in resolution fi -
nancing reveals the key significance of the new 
minimum requirements TLAC and MREL: as the 
first line of defence against threats to financial 
stability and burdens on taxpayers, the bail-  in  
tool can only function if institutions that are to 
be resolved have sufficient loss-  absorbing cap -
acity which can be used to cover losses in a 
timely and legally sound manner. The new min -
imum standards, in the shape of TLAC and 
MREL, are therefore essential requirements for 
the proper functioning of the bail-  in tool and  
thus the credibility of the new resolution re -
gime. At the same time, clear criteria need to 
apply to TLAC and MREL so that the availability 
of these liabilities is assured in the event of 
resolution. A key part of this is the subordin -
ation criterion that was implemented as a man -
datory requirement for TLAC but should also apply to MREL. While it is important that the 
MREL is set at a sufficiently high level, at the 
same time, institutions must not be overbur -
dened; this means appropriate transitional 
periods for fulfilling the requirements should be allowed. Finally, it should be noted that a num -
ber of issues concerning the MREL require -
ment’s definition, such as the treatment of buf -
fers and final agreement on the criteria for 
MREL-  eligible liabilities, ar e still outstanding. 
These issues should be addressed promptly and effectively to provide banks and investors with clarity.
Ultimately, the resolution regime can only be 
credible and effective if its implementation and application are consistent. There is evidence of Sanction

a number of policy initiatives aimed at soften -
ing the new rules; however, doing this would 
be sending the wrong signal and would com -
promise the resolution regime’s credibility. A 
functioning resolution mechanism is an import -
ant step towards severing the close ties be -tween banks and sovereigns. Other measures 
must now follow, such as imposing limits or 
capital requirements on bank lending to sover -
eigns and improving the consistency of insolv-ency legislation at the international level.Deutsche Bundesbank
